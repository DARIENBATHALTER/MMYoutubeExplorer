help so many other people out there find

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,570
their way and you know when you can't

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,339
find answers and you know you're going

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,000
to doctor the doctor and you feel that

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,850
kind of hopelessness take over and you

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,100
realize that you know you're really sick

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,200
it's just it's so important to have a

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,869
way out or to have information that

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,049
makes sense and you know that's why I

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,360
mean you guys are warriors really you

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,970
are your health warriors you're here

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,259
you're fighting for the people and

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,689
that's what you're doing I mean I know

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,850
I've seen your work out there it's the

32
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:39,119
first time we've ever met which is

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,740
really exciting all on its own and but

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,009
I've watched your work on social media

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,860
and how much you care about people and

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,170
how invested you are about getting the

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,270
message out so people can heal and and

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,970
find the answers they need you guys

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,340
really care yeah us I've always noticed

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,479
I'm a big role model for us because you

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,700
care for for the humanity and this is so

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,310
important for us and we want to give the

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,220
light to other people that they can

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,720
actually heal because healing is is so

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,900
so it's possible with the right kind of

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,049
information yeah

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,250
you know it's about empowerment and

48
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,500
healing empowerment you know we get

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,500
disempowered and I talk about that a lot

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,480
lately is that you know when we're told

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,909
their body's attacking itself and we're

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,010
told that you know it's our genes and

53
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,239
we're it's whole or creating it that's a

54
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,280
whole nother thing do you ever hear that

55
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,890
is that just me talking about that all

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,569
the time but because I've always I heard

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,549
that out there where people are like you

58
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,409
know maybe I'm creating this with me you

59
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,150
know with my mic my sickness because I'm

60
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,060
thinking the wrong way did you go

61
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,579
through that that was exactly what

62
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,709
doctors told me so when I got to the

63
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:57,370
doctor's office my first diagnosis was

64
00:02:50,709 --> 00:03:00,400
Hashimoto and emoto's and next psoriasis

65
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,340
psoriasis at writers and artists writers

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,010
came up well they always told me okay

67
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,099
Anika your body is destroying yourself

68
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,810
and you have to live with this and

69
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:17,739
probably you will not be you will not be

70
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,780
able to get an old age so you have to

71
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,810
learn to live with this and you're

72
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,819
servicing your mind has problem because

73
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,190
you know you are sick and you're getting

74
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:33,519
sicker because you think that you are

75
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:35,109
sick so it was it was weird so we get

76
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,569
told and that's what happens with women

77
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,150
right now where we think women are

78
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,190
empowered but yet they're disempowered

79
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,379
in the worst worst way we could ever

80
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,629
possibly imagine in our history right

81
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:49,959
now which is their bodies and their

82
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,910
health and so we it's like almost like a

83
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,709
joke being played on everybody out there

84
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,419
Alaura it's almost like no one wants to

85
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,400
talk about this and it's spirit of

86
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,530
compassion is is who gave me this

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,989
information all these years you guys

88
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,730
know I talk about that and and so and

89
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,010
spirit of compassion always said to me

90
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,349
women women this empowerment is going to

91
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,199
be at its all-time high where we are now

92
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,819
and that's unimaginable when you think

93
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,319
about it because how is that possible

94
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,199
how can we even think about that being

95
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,000
that way but when we're told our bodies

96
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
are too immense you when we're told our

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,500
bodies are destroying itself our body's

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,960
immune systems are attacking glands and

99
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,590
organs and that you know and then and

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,060
then it

101
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,610
that's it since they don't have an

102
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,780
answer for why you're sick they don't

103
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,070
have an answer research and science

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,410
doesn't have an answer it's not the

105
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,449
doctors fault doctors are great but

106
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,460
because they don't have the answer then

107
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,250
all of a sudden people try to figure out

108
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,560
well maybe it's a attraction maybe it's

109
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,110
how we're thinking maybe it's we're

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,970
manifesting it that is disastrous

111
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,790
because that might be great for other

112
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,830
things that aren't your body that might

113
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,440
be okay for like I want to attract a

114
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,240
good relationship I want to manifest a

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,040
good relationship I want to manifest

116
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,590
love I want to manifest this and what a

117
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,780
manifest a good job a good career I want

118
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,460
to manifest them that's great but when

119
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,050
it comes down to health so when it comes

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,450
down to why we're sick while we're going

121
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,780
through so much when we feel like we do

122
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,919
what we have all these symptoms it's

123
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,410
disasterous to think that we may be

124
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,880
manifest at that yeah and that's

125
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,590
happening right now I'm seeing that all

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,270
the time because research science

127
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,130
doesn't have the answers everybody's

128
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,020
running around sick and then you get

129
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,300
healthier people who haven't been sick

130
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,000
yet say to other women other young women

131
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,760
like no you're just you're not you're

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,919
not on your game right you're not you're

133
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,500
not like connecting up there you're not

134
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,240
spiritually connected because you're not

135
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,370
doing what you're supposed to do and

136
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,479
you're not like and that's disaster so

137
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,889
that's a whole nother form of

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,979
disempowerment I'm seeing growing

139
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,240
rapidly because once again nobody has

140
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,320
the answers to chronic illness

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,300
absolutely I think you desperately

142
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,440
empowered women so it's so important in

143
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,020
our work not just physical level also on

144
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,060
a mental mental level so Benjamin is

145
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,169
icon is a psychologist and we are

146
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,310
working a lot with some mental part of

147
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:17,030
healing recovering people because of the

148
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,910
wounds from your bodies destroying

149
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,520
itself the wounds of being siccola got a

150
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,900
loan of going through that because when

151
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,210
you feel hopeless and you're in that

152
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,500
place you get into a dark place people

153
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,320
get into a dark post I've been watching

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,240
that for 35 years and maybe even a

155
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,810
little longer than that and so when I

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,599
was little

157
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,690
and you know this is our place you can

158
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:41,199
go into and so I just knew you guys are

159
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:44,449
doing amazing work that's why I had a

160
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,509
you know I have to get them here it has

161
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:51,830
to be the first episode of this season

162
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:54,139
has to be you guys because you guys are

163
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,060
you guys are world changers and and and

164
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,349
that matters to me with the informations

165
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,779
tell me a little bit about your story

166
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,490
too and I know we're going a little bit

167
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:04,219
into - you're going to different doctors

168
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,159
and you're diagnosed with Hashimoto's

169
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:10,340
you're diagnosed with with us right so

170
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:12,919
this all started ten years ago when I

171
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,840
was a young college student Benjamin and

172
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,120
I were a young couple and we lived a

173
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,080
fully flat laugh we were very happy and

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,199
absolutely yeah

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,509
then out of a sudden symptoms started I

176
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,270
remember the date quite well went to the

177
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,150
bus station and out of a sudden I got

178
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,270
very dizzy and got something called

179
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,009
brain fog today I know it is brain fog

180
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,279
because you have a radio show about it

181
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,349
and you talking you books about it and

182
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,430
let me ask you for example here's all

183
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:51,889
the information in about brain fog and

184
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,659
this was such a hard symptom for me to

185
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:58,219
live this because when you have brain

186
00:07:53,659 --> 00:08:01,069
fog you can't move through you your

187
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:08,599
normal daily life your normal business

188
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:11,270
I became awesome I also got a lot of

189
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:15,259
symptoms neurological symptoms nag

190
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:18,529
neurological fatigue tingling numbness

191
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:21,409
and fatigue is the whole thing with that

192
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,250
is that this medical meeting information

193
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:27,050
it's neurological fatigue because

194
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,969
doctors never put fatigue with

195
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,490
neurological together before that never

196
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:33,440
happened and either did research in

197
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,329
science it's either your fatigue and

198
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,550
that's it your fatigue but

199
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,870
neurologically fatigue means that

200
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,029
there's something going out the center

201
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,640
that your central nervous system is

202
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,399
having trouble and that's causing your

203
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,779
fatigue and there's so much information

204
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,850
I talk about that but so you have the

205
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,880
neurological fatigue going on the tables

206
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:58,220
and and and tiredness all day long

207
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,829
yeah you had you had to do the mattress

208
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,500
island thing I call it mattress island

209
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,899
where we're you know we spend more time

210
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,820
in bed than we want to that's right and

211
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,980
that's hard that's hard for women

212
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,670
because women and men too of course but

213
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,779
it's hard for anyone to who wants to

214
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,399
move and groove and they want to get

215
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,750
things done they want to like work hard

216
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,149
they want to survive they want and then

217
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,720
you start feeling then you start feeling

218
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:27,079
like well I'm not productive right my

219
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,730
studies yeah I had to stop it and other

220
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:38,449

everything today I'm 33 and begins 10

223
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,260
years ago and I had tinnitus

224
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,320
and flowers in my eyes and problem was

225
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,199
my that was my vision so everything

226
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,959
around me was just in a like brain

227
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:08,959
focus and that's why why it's called

228
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:11,720
right yeah it was it was a hard time but

229
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,250
I am a lucky one because I have my my

230
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,370
husband and he was on my side every

231
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,279
every time on this on this journey and

232
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,160
there's a tough losing but it's I

233
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,470
learned so so much the last 10 years and

234
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,019
after seven years of chronic illness and

235
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:34,670
a bunch of symptoms I found your first

236
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:42,079
book medical medium and I think is it is

237
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:43,730
better than right it's a quite funny

238
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,800
story actually because I came home from

239
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:50,000
work and Anika was sitting on the couch

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,760
and reading this blue book and looking

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,889
with me looking to me was was tears in

242
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,529
her eyes and and I recognized

243
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,610
immediately that that aren't tears of

244
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:04,310
sadness but I couldn't find the onions

245
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,200
she mustered so as I was looking at all

246
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,910
the onions where was it

247
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,910
years came from but I couldn't find them

248
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:17,000
just tears of joy and then she looked at

249
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,570
me and said okay honey I finally found

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,880
the answer yeah and this was was like

251
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,990
and and I believe her immediately

252
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,030
and we went through so hard times and

253
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,810
and it was sometimes we were so

254
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:37,460
desperate of looking for answers looking

255
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,850
looking for solutions and but when when

256
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,130
you looked at me I like okay Wow yeah

257
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,580
give it a try when I read your book I

258
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,850
know this is the truth this is not just

259
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,970
an idea or opportunity in your

260
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:56,960
opportunity I tried so many diets and

261
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,170
lifestyle changes and therapies but I

262
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,810
never saw it okay this is the answer but

263
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:08,000
when I read your book everything makes

264
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:11,900
sense you you gave me so much relief so

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,210
from our heart for my entire being so

266
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,410
from my perspective it was like Anika

267
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,210
felt understood like finally someone

268
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,040
understood her and it's not saying I'll

269
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,980
you're you're making this with your mind

270
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,680
or or you're overreacting

271
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,260
your drama ring and stuff like that so

272
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,690
finally you had some feeling that that

273
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,150
you someone understood you yeah and

274
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,670
that's a great thing in our daily work

275
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,880
when we work with clients guiding them

276
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,190
through their illnesses with your

277
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,640
information the moment when they realize

278
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:53,170
that their body is not destroying itself

279
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:58,490
yeah yeah and that they are not that

280
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:01,040
they have not that they have not sorry

281
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,740
just have to find the right word that

282
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,370
the illnesses are not their fault

283
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:10,400
forward wasn't but then it is like magic

284
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,110
happens and this is part of empowerment

285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,440
you're talking about this is so

286
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,770
important to realize it's not your fault

287
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
and you can do something against it you

288
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,509
know what happens is

289
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,310
but that was the plan that was the plan

290
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:29,860
for a spirit of compassion so when I was

291
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:32,050
writing that book you know it was it and

292
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,540
I was taking down the information I was

293
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,370
writing word-for-word with spirit of

294
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,490
mash it was telling me that's right now

295
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,629
in the words and you know it's like it

296
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,059
made sense to me

297
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,699
every Devery sentence was it made sense

298
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:48,910
and I was like so this is going to speak

299
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:51,069
to the ones that that need the answers

300
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,579
and spirit clash was like that's the

301
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:56,769
plan is that they see what they're

302
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,470
really going through and there is a way

303
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,209
out and that it that there I remember

304
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,850
writing that your body doesn't attack

305
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:06,279
itself and your immune system doesn't

306
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,040
attack itself in that first book I

307
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:13,480
remember writing sentence for me this

308
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,350
was so oh my gosh what this is crazy i

309
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,259
but in a good way

310
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,290
that's perfect it's so helpful and this

311
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:22,749
was so full of come compassion for me

312
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,399
part of me a big part of me wishes that

313
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:29,920
that I I had that book out years and

314
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,620
years earlier like I was supposed to do

315
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,209
and but the waiting lists in the

316
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,730
millions of people waiting for help I

317
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,670
had to help daily everyday I was hoping

318
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,550
you know 30 to 50 people a day and seven

319
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,800

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,750
it's not like starting and a few days

365
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,060
later you feeling like if you go on

366
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,550
taking after it's not like taking a pill

367
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,940
oh it is is this um you have work to do

368
00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:00,390
and but when you have faith and trust is

369
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:04,050
in your body then you go for it and you

370
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,329
will heal and this is just the most

371
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,939
amazing thing I've ever done in my life

372
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:12,329
to start this healing healing journey

373
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:15,329
and to trust to trust you to just spirit

374
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,250
to trust myself in my body and I want I

375
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,790
want everybody to have their control

376
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,230
back over their health and I know that

377
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,000
when people aren't that sick and they

378
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,819
haven't been there yet and they haven't

379
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,280
been in the trenches where you were okay

380
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,040
and they only have a little bit of acne

381
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,929
which is no fun or they only have maybe

382
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,610
a little bit of Aksum on it kind of

383
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,320
comes and goes a little bit but they're

384
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,720
able to go and they're able to work out

385
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,460
every day and they're able to live their

386
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,770
life and run around and get their coffee

387
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,570
drinks and and they're able to get off a

388
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,130
gluten

389
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,960
and somebody gives them advice to do

390
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,820
this and somebody clears up a little war

391
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,259
they feel a little bit better here and

392
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,809
there and they're not in that place

393
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:55,580
they're not in that place they still

394
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:58,970
feel like they got control as they play

395
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:02,000
guessing games and and but when you get

396
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,090
when when that shifts and stuff starts

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,090
to catch up and and you start getting

398
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,559
sick and things that like pathogens that

399
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,690
people don't even know about or talk

400
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,250
about or in your system that are in the

401
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,080
medical medium book so people can learn

402
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,759
and you learn and all of a sudden you're

403
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,200
going to those doctors and you're really

404
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,730
getting appointments and you're really

405
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,580
and you're losing your in the fatigue

406
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,320
and you're getting the brain fog and

407
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,730
you're not able to do that workout in

408
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,649
the gym for an hour and a half every day

409
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,509
and you're not able to and you can't

410
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,879
really think and you can't see you feel

411
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:34,039
so fatigued once it goes then you just

412
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:36,710
you realize that no we don't have

413
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:39,200
control and I always tell people don't

414
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,340
let it get to that point learn the

415
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,740
information to where where you can heal

416
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,929
and come back from such difficult times

417
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,309
and struggles and what's what's

418
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,889
disheartening out there and what I see

419
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:53,330
is there's people that play around in

420
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,519
the whole guessing game land because

421
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,159
they're not really sick sick they really

422
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,659
haven't gone into the having been

423
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,370
through hell and back or anything

424
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,799
they're just playing around and they're

425
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,080
playing around and I understand that but

426
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,710
it's sad because there's so much noise

427
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,889
out there

428
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,279
to play around with yeah so much yeah

429
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:16,519
and people are realized this is the only

430
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,750
information it's ever been out there he

431
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:22,730
gets you out of the trenches was this

432
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,889

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,230
your you're somebody that fought your

445
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,230
way back you found information you

446
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,770
fought your way back

447
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,660
back in ensure okay sure the books are

448
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,710
there the information set but it takes

449
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,600
also somebody to be like you know I'm I

450
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,520
gotta I gotta do this

451
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm tired this I don't want to live like

452
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,380
this anymore see so you're liking you're

453
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,360
a hero you need to use it you need to

454
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,059
use the information it's not enough that

455
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,760
the information is there you need to

456
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:26,700
read it and to reread it and to think

457
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,850
about it and to live with it and this is

458
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:34,230
what I did I not only read your books

459
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:38,220
once I read it I read them quite a few

460
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:42,660
times and sometimes I reread some some

461
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,500
pages because I always find another a

462
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,929
new thing

463
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,820
when a new and you think when I read

464
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:52,260
different places and you can actually

465
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:56,010
this is the magical trainer yes and I

466
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:59,190
think this is a magical thing about your

467
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:02,570
books I found answers for all my

468
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:06,360
symptoms and I had a list it was so long

469
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:09,540
just symptoms from literally from head

470
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:13,500
to toe nearly every part of my body had

471
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:16,710
at least one symptoms and I found

472
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,740
answers for every single symptom in your

473
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,290
book and the connection between them and

474
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,980
everything makes sense and this was so

475
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:28,080
Wow absolutely mind-blowing what's

476
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,030
important to have answers to all the

477
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,070
different symptoms to like why is the

478
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,490
symptom there what's causing the symptom

479
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,080
because that's not anywhere else and

480
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,940
it's just not there research and science

481
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,980
doesn't have it for anyone they just

482
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,860
don't have any answers it's your genes

483
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,580
are bad or your body's destroying itself

484
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,380
or if you go in kind of the new-age area

485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,710
that all like and you're not spiritually

486
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,380
connected your your manifesting it wrong

487
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:58,130
and that's why that's why your sake we

488
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,799
can't accept that that's not acceptable

489
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:04,350
it's not supposed to be okay to be the

490
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,840
new normal for every single person have

491
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,640
a symptom or five symptoms your case

492
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,730
like 15 symptoms

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,970
maybe even more and it's not it's not

494
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:19,140
right to have to live like that

495
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,929
and so look you know what I love is I

496
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,279

spiritual power in a way that is the

502
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,789
guide for people and I see it that way

503
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,070
it's like well if I was ever sick if I

504
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,460
was ever sick if I was ever down and out

505
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,769
if I was ever struggling if I was just

506
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,610

507
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:02,970
having control and you are like Anthony

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:36,149

526
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,500
hearing a voice from up here giving me

527
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:09,809
advance medical information and also

528
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,909
other information I'm writing it down in

529
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,740
here I don't know if I'm spiritual I

530
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,330
don't know what you would call it what

531
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,940
do you mean because people say what how

532
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,910
are you really spiritual though and well

533
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,430
I'm getting the information from up here

534
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:29,430
I don't know if that accounts for being

535
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:32,910
spiritual because I'm not doing the

536
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:35,040
spiritual talk that's maybe trending so

537
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,050
much you know where everybody's doing

538
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,700
the spiritual vibe or a spiritual talk

539
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,260
that's trending so much and I'm not like

540
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,210
gee I'm not I'm always talking about

541
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,500
illness and sickness and people

542
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:48,150
struggling and and because I feel that

543
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,770
that's the most spiritual place you

544
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:54,480
could ever go is someone's struggle

545
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,310
there because you lose your spirit when

546
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,560
you're sick right so I don't know

547
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,690
anything more spiritual than that where

548
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,430
you're sick you're not feeling good

549
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,230
you're your there's a part of you you're

550
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,110
losing you're feeling like you're losing

551
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,390
you get the hopelessness for so many

552
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,550
people going through it your spirits

553
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,440
breaking down I've had people come to me

554
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,080
over the years when they get a chance to

555
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,280
talk to me all these years ago and they

556
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,670
would get a chance to talk to me and

557
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,460
they'd be like my spirits broken yeah my

558
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,760
spirit is broken and so I don't think

559
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,670
there's anything more spiritual than

560
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,760
getting somebody's life back because

561
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:34,770
it's not about a spiritual mumbo-jumbo

562
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,750
or still like it's not like spiritual

563
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,700
trending words or anything it's about

564
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,580
when you get your life back there's

565
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,240
nothing more spiritually powerful than

566
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,870
that yes because we all have souls well

567
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,300
we work we're spiritual beings here

568
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,760
doesn't matter how we kind of cookie cut

569
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,640
it or how we dress it up or how we gloss

570
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,210
it up or what's trending or how we talk

571
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,080
it's about worse more spiritual beings

572
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,670
and when we're losing our lives and

573
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,840
we're in that dark place and we're in

574
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,820
that dark hopelessness and we're

575
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,280
suffering and we're struggling and our

576
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,900
spirits are broken and I mean I people

577
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,210
tell me that over the years this is what

578
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,810
it feels like and you come back from

579
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:22,980
that that's spiritual empowerment that's

580
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:26,250
that's what that is and you know and and

581
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,470
I've had people come back from from the

582
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,440
depths of of despair from healing like

583
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,299
with you from from being sick and and

584
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,950
you become my spiritually

585
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,499
do you feel like do you feel it's that

586
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,320
tool away to you like it's almost like I

587
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:42,179
get a new chance yeah absolutely there's

588
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,149
something about that having that new

589
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:48,179
chance is a new chance and you wrote it

590
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:52,190
so so wonderful in one of your books you

591
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,899
said that we have a part of our soul so

592
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:59,179
upwards in the universe behind the Stars

593
00:26:54,899 --> 00:27:04,619
and that even if we are so so broken and

594
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:07,440
feel so emotional tired and lost that we

595
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:13,009
can connect with this part of our soul

596
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:20,429
and when I read that I stood outside

597
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:23,519
looking to the Stars and cried now that

598
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:25,799
that we have the the heel part of our

599
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,749
soul to connect this yeah it gets me

600
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,299
choked up and because they remember when

601
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:32,850
spirit of compassion told me that and so

602
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:35,220
I put it in the book and and I remember

603
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,129
when spirit compassion told me that long

604
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,109
before I even put it in in the book

605
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:44,309
because I would tell people I would say

606
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:45,720
you if if you feel you're in that place

607
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,940
right now people would come to me so

608
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,109
sick and I'd say look I just want you to

609
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,809
look at the Stars

610
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:54,779
and I want you to know that there's a

611
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:58,759
there's a part of your soul that stays

612
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:01,529
protective up there in those stars

613
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:04,139
behind those stars and there's a part of

614
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:07,379
you that stays protected it's there for

615
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:09,869
a reason because we get broken down here

616
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:11,730
we go through betrayal we go through the

617
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,019
trust to breakage we grow when when

618
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,159
someone breaks your trust when someone

619
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,749
stabs you in the back when somebody

620
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,759
betrays you when someone hurts you and

621
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:21,029
someone if we go through so much

622
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,700
different kind of letdowns here from

623
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:25,200
emotional upsets and breakups and all

624
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,210
kinds of things that we have

625
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,679
relationship people that people go

626
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,470
through problems and all these things

627
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,509
kick just if you like it wrecks you

628
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:37,289
there's a part of your soul that stays

629
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:40,049
untouched and free from all of that way

630
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:42,179
up spirit of compassion told me and you

631
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,710
just have to look up you have to look up

632
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,310
behind those stars and you know it's

633
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,560
there

634
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,990
for you and connect with it and that's

635
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,810
gonna give you that extra power to start

636
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,380
that battery power in your soul and in

637
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,460
your spirit to start bringing you back

638
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,310
while you're working on your healing

639
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,700
process I remember this was a long time

640
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:04,410
before and we read your books was when I

641
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,270
was back in New Zealand and I had this

642
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:13,470
bad bad injury and I almost died was was

643
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:16,320
bleeding brain and I'm during this time

644
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:20,160
before that happened one of my greatest

645
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,340
fears was always death not dying but

646
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:27,480
death and then I got this experience and

647
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:31,010
I almost died and the doctors in Germany

648
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:36,960
couldn't understand how I survived and

649
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:39,330
it was so funny but and and but but what

650
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,920
happened was like that it was like I was

651
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,530
staying there in front of the door

652
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,810
knocking and and someone said no not

653
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:49,560
soon it's not your time and this really

654
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:52,290
changed my thinking about Wow and it was

655
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,880
amazing and this was was before we read

656
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,980
your books and then your books came and

657
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,320
it was again like wow yes it's right

658
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,920
what what you experienced this is real

659
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:13,140
yeah that's incredible that's a powerful

660
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:14,160
story going to near-death and doctors

661
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,170
wondering if you're gonna make it

662
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,240
exactly I you know what I wanted to ask

663
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,670
you guys like your foods and supplements

664
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,810
and you're doing things like that so

665
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,640
what are you doing for the foods I mean

666
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:31,080
I have a heavy metal detox ability of

667
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,390
course always in front of me juice is so

668
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,250
important for us because when we started

669
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:41,010
with celery juice it was three years ago

670
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:44,700
the first thing we realized was the

671
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:47,970
Benjamin get rid of his exit reflux so

672
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,540
the celery juice accelerate roses was

673
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,580
the first change in our diet the celery

674
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,670
juice and he had

675
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:01,590
bad exit reflux for his entire life

676
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:03,780
since childhood and in as a child you

677
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:07,770
saw it is quite normal to have such

678
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:10,830
burning in your throat right no I think

679
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,920
I I told my parents when I was 16 or so

680
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:18,809
and but I experienced I think the first

681
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,400
time I remember it was was 5 and since I

682
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,679
said okay we need to do something we

683
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:32,190
need to do a gastro and send I looked

684
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:35,640
and said today this yeah and and yeah

685
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,320
and I took pills so long and I always

686
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,880
had the feelings it's not right it's not

687
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,250
right and even when I was studying

688
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,010
nursing I it was like oh my god I can't

689
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,260
take such pills anymore cuz what am i

690
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,630

691
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,970
whole guts was this pills and I didn't

692
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,920
want to do it anymore and finally it was

693
00:31:53,970 --> 00:32:00,929
amazing you know your whole life

694
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,460
spending with having reflux or knowing

695
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:05,400
that you're doing something better your

696
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,160
body and was kind of a big relief

697
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,840
business celery juice and well how long

698
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,040
did you do the soul just before it start

699
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,860
easing up a few weeks I think I was so

700
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,260
fast and so it's very fast so we changed

701
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,260
a little bit more we cut off for no food

702
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:27,110
so everything that feed viruses and

703
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:31,920
bacteria we cut off so X and diary and

704
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:34,350
gluten and because I thought okay there

705
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,080
are these box viruses and bacteria and

706
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:41,190
they are making me sick and I don't want

707
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,309
to feed them one day longer so this was

708
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:48,059
my decision and so I cut off the no

709
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:50,520
foods you know the people say well how

710
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,740
can X be bad for you everybody's still

711
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,330
being told to eat eggs they're so like

712
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,220
you know it had some women are being

713
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,600
told every day young women just eat eggs

714
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,030
make sure you get your protein make sure

715
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,880
you get your healthy here healthy eggs

716
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,250
in you and all the stuff and it's really

717
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,250
sad because

718
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,530
eggs actually feed everything that makes

719
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,900
us sick the reason why were six these

720
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,610
pathogens and you know so when I did

721
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:19,760
with with the new cleanse the heal book

722
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:22,100
coming out i I really pushed spirit of

723
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,870
compassion really hard with the new

724
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,610
cleansing heal book so this is this is

725
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,700
actually that this isn't a book it's

726
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:31,310
simple this is mine did my copy which is

727
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,160
the manuscript I'm editing right here

728
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,650
this is and but it's it's on Amazon if

729
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,790
you want to find it um cleanse the heal

730
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,790
it's coming out soon

731
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,890
but anyway so what I did was I really

732
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:46,280
pushed spirit of compassion hard I said

733
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:50,240
I want all the information you can give

734
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:53,300
me on why eggs are hurting us and why we

735
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,280
need to stay away from them because you

736
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,130
know a shirt you told me it feeds

737
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,650
pathogens I want all of this information

738
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,330
so people can be armed and they can be

739
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,580
protected and they can have that shield

740
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,770
of protection to know that if they're

741
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,480
dealing with brain fog and you know

742
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,190
tinkles of numbness fibromyalgia

743
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,200
Hashimoto's and actually psoriasis

744
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,860
whatever it is that you don't want to do

745
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,760
eggs so it's really critical that you

746
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,530
don't do eggs and so spirit gave me so

747
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,990
much information about eggs and why we

748
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,940
shouldn't be eating them and it I love

749
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,649
eggs it's not even like it's not even

750
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,480
like I hate them or anything like that I

751
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,830
don't and people people are like way to

752
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,300
me you must have Lee system you just

753
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:36,970
don't like them or something no that's

754
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,970
not it they taste really really good

755
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:46,060
that's the whole problem and it's a

756
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:48,590
man-made thing right because we used

757
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,990
they used them in the last yes what

758
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,100
that's what that's that's what research

759
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,540
in science that's what the

760
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,810
pharmaceutical companies did they took

761
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,330
eggs a survival food that kept people

762
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,220
alive in so many situations around the

763
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,560
world because they were an important

764
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,020
food and they took that food and they

765
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,570
used it as a fuel source for pathogens

766
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,870
they raised in the lab back eighty years

767
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:15,030
ago ninety years ago like 80 years like

768
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:17,550
70 80 years ago all in that realm

769
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,290
and they still they still use them and

770
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,640
no one knows about it they don't talk

771
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,290
about it and no one gets that

772
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,970
information so what happens is when you

773
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,980
have the epstein-barr causing your

774
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:29,010
neurological fatigue your aches and

775
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,750
pains your eczema your psoriasis your

776
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,330
Hashimoto's your thyroid problems your

777
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,619
your fibromyalgia your your all these

778
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,840
different things are the shingles fires

779
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,849
causing your trigeminal neuralgia and

780
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,960
your neuropathy all these different

781
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,230
things that people are dealing with

782
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,730
every day then you eat eggs you're just

783
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,900
feeding that bug you're feeding that

784
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,849
epstein-barr you're feeding that

785
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,430
shingles virus and it's going to town

786
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:54,119
it's it's eating it's it's staying

787
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:57,720
strong and you stay sick and you know

788
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:01,280
it's amazing how you know the people are

789
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,280
so emotionally connected to eggs and I

790
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:12,030
read your books I ate just eggs and meat

791
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,210
and diary prologue says this was my diet

792
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,790
because bacon eggs and bacon and doctors

793
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,700
told me you have to stay away from fruit

794
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:24,300
so the fruit fear was going around and

795
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:29,210
this was the worst thing I think about

796
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:34,770
my diet no fruit no a lot of fat and no

797
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:38,310
very rare red veggies just meat eggs and

798
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:41,420
it was like it worked for for Buffett I

799
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:44,580
guess when we were just just diet like

800
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,480
some Munson's and my whole system

801
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,940
collapsed

802
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,550
well the reason why there what happens

803
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,760
is when you go off of processed foods

804
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:55,910
and and you just go on say eggs meat

805
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,380
dairy you're gonna feel a little better

806
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,150
you are because you're all for processed

807
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,369
foods it's just so just say somebody

808
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,320
wasn't as sick as you and they just had

809
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:06,810
a little bit of eczema a little bit of

810
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,940
brain fog once in a while maybe maybe

811
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,940
they just didn't feel like they had that

812
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,849
much energy or they had some acne and

813
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,349
there then then there they're told stay

814
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,390
off of processed foods but make sure you

815
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:19,470
keep your eggs in there soon as they get

816
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,580
off the processed foods you're gonna

817
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,770
start feeling better and they think they

818
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,180
found the Holy Grail they think that oh

819
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,040
wait a minute could still have some eggs

820
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,140
still have some of this don't have some

821
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
salmon still have you know lots of nuts

822
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,270
and sea

823
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,770
seeds still have some peanuts the seeds

824
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,210
are healthy but having a lot of them is

825
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,670
not really a good idea you can still

826
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,700
have all these different high-fat foods

827
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,400
or you can still have some cheese

828
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,770
healthy cheese some yogurt some he can

829
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,760
still have these things and then what

830
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,400
happens is what they don't realize

831
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,930
though is that they'll get a little bit

832
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,710
better they'll start feeling a little

833
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,690
bit better and then all of a sudden you

834
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,640
know things can take a turn down the

835
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,320
road or they'll just stay in that

836
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,270
guessing game area where they can get

837
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,950
away with just eating the trendy diet

838
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,870
keeping eggs and but when you're

839
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,340
somebody that really high and it can get

840
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,920
you in trouble go down a road you start

841
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,090
getting a little older and then it hits

842
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,830
and you start getting all your heart

843
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,450
palpitations and eat camp you know

844
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,700
office and live your life and you get

845
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,920
all these other things but with you you

846
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,540
were really at this place where you had

847
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,700
a lot of a lot of stuff going on like

848
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,520
millions of people do millions of women

849
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,400
do they have all these symptoms okay

850
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,470
and you you went off the processed food

851
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,570
and you just you kept your diet really

852
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,880
clean like doctors wanna you kept like

853
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,350
the eggs you kept the bacon in there you

854
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,200
kept right and you noticed a difference

855
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,390
you were feeling a little bit better yes

856
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,410
when everybody goes on their keto diet

857
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:47,010
there are Paleo diet and when you eat

858
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:50,370
such yes high-fat diets you produce so

859
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:53,630
much adrenaline and this is why you feel

860
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:56,460
a little bit better I think um yeah and

861
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,160
this was a first step for me cutting out

862
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,950
the no foods drinking celery juice and

863
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,770
the heavy-metal detox smoothie was was

864
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:07,800
very important because because I had so

865
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:11,240
so many heavy metals and my body

866
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:15,240
floating around they play a huge part in

867
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,130
this brain fog and so I started very

868
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,360
slowly with the heavy metal detox

869
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:24,270
smoothie on a daily base and yeah we

870
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:28,530
still drink it every day it was full

871
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:31,560
amounts of every ingredient and I think

872
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,930
that's the most important part yes you

873
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,780
started and I just followed yeah and

874
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:39,000
what we experienced was that I could

875
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,440
handle more than you could yeah you for

876
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,619
example was the celery juice as well as

877
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,259
heavy-metal detox smoothie and I just

878
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:49,779
followed and I had my own to be honest

879
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,420
my up and downs might a few transaction

880
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:57,160
costs because I I wasn't coming from

881
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:58,900
this bad situation as Annika was so and

882
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,660
this is a funny thing about your mind

883
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,890
cause because I just experienced that I

884
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,960
felt better quite fast and then this

885
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:12,880
little man in my head was like oh yeah

886
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:30,640
now you can try it again go back to your

887
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:33,999
own behavior and I needed some you asked

888
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:38,910
about supplements so I take a lot to be

889
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:41,769
honest I took a lot and I take a lot and

890
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:45,369
my favorite supplements lemon balm

891
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:48,249
because lemon born always grounded me on

892
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:50,469
an emotional level and it helps my

893
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:53,259
nervous system because when you have a

894
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:56,019
problem so this is just my opinion but

895
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:59,619
when you had a problem with your nervous

896
00:40:56,019 --> 00:41:02,140
system for such a long period of time

897
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:02,769
then this is nothing that changed

898
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,789
overnight

899
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:09,849
so I'm three years on this journey right

900
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:13,329
now with your information and I healed a

901
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:16,509
lot so I never thought three years ago

902
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:19,359
that I will ever reach such a healthy

903
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:21,460
state for me in my body you know what's

904
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,259
amazing is you guys do just the medical

905
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,700
medium information you don't mix it up

906
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:26,950
you're not adding in the apple cider

907
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,930
vinegar you're not you know you're not

908
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,099
adding in the collagen you're not adding

909
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,069
in all these other things you're not

910
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,839
mixing it up we're we're including

911
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:36,999
changing up foods and doing this where

912
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,109
you're getting all this misinformation

913
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,940
on the Internet

914
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:42,039
you guys are sticking with this

915
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,960
information here that the the

916
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,380
information that's swapping the internet

917
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,990
that's both good and bad

918
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,300
is is a compilation of just guessing

919
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,890
games that are man-made and I always try

920
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,130
to tell people this because someone will

921
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,830
say to me why do I want medical medium

922
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,560
information why would I want your

923
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:03,840
information because it's not man-made

924
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,930
it's not manly right and and that means

925
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,530
it's not contaminated with guessing

926
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,750
games or interests money behind it or

927
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,730
investors behind it or trendsetters

928
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,500
behind it that have investment nesters

929
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,760
or whatever it is or research and

930
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,610
science where there's a thumb on the

931
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,410
scale so no one gets fired I'm in the in

932
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,790
the in I've had scientists tell me you

933
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,840
don't want if you want to keep your job

934
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:30,210
you better produce a result whether you

935
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,950
like it or not one thing whether you see

936
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:34,410
something bad you don't talk about what

937
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:36,030
you see bad you just scientists they

938
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,440
just gotta talk about a one little thing

939
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,360
that might have been positive because

940
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,220
you don't want to never work again in

941
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,780
the science field that I've heard that

942
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,660
from so many different scientists it's

943
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,080
like either scientists have they have

944
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:51,120
this this common saying which do you

945
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,630
want to work again or do you never want

946
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,300
to work again yeah and so so well this

947
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:00,210
isn't man-made information and the

948
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,940
information works so when I started with

949
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:07,920
your information and to change my diet

950
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:10,740
and so in my lifestyle at the time I got

951
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,100
my breast implants removed I had breast

952
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,990
implants for eight years of my life and

953
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:18,810
you have a radio show about breasts and

954
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:23,120
containers and breast implant illness is

955
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:26,190
a real thing it's not the cause of

956
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,650
chronic illness but it's a huge trigger

957
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,350
of course you have those influence in

958
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,260
your body and they are full of heavy

959
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,810
metals and other toxic stuff and you

960
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,450
wearing it under your skin and it's

961
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:42,990
always there and it's a big trigger and

962
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:46,950
a great place for bacteria to live in

963
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:52,590
and so I've got the breast implants

964
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:56,700
removed and I recovered so so quick with

965
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:58,890
your diet information from this surgery

966
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,109
it was a big surgery because the

967
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,730
implants were

968
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:06,329
everywhere my body literally and

969
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:10,140
connected to my bones so this was big

970
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:12,690
surgery and I recovered so so quick with

971
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:19,560
celery juice with mangoes they were

972
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:22,200
played at mangos like always a time and

973
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:29,520
this was so this was like hey that was

974
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:31,800
fruit you know it people have to

975
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,900
understand that some people like many

976
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,990
women can have the breast implants and

977
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,970
not experience any problems because in

978
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:43,589
that moment they don't have an Epstein

979
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:45,990
bar that's actually basically out of the

980
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:47,640
running out of the gate and and running

981
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,170
around through the body causing trouble

982
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,790
they don't have a shingles they don't

983
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,230
have multiple Epstein bars they don't

984
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,579
have an hhv-6 they don't have a

985
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,550
cytomegalovirus they don't have a

986
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:59,520
simplex one or two and or they don't

987
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,560
have a really bad bad mix of them all

988
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,560
you know what happens is that is that

989
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:07,470
but you can have the breast implants and

990
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,420
then they're creating toxins you're

991
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,880
creating toxins or discharging toxins

992
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,730
and there's nothing feeding on those

993
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,440
toxins until you end up picking up your

994
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,849
first step scene bar in a relationship

995
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,380
or you pick you up at the first Epstein

996
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:21,810
bar in a restaurant because you chefs

997
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,069
cut their finger or you pick up your

998
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,720
first step steam bar sharing some

999
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:26,460
glasses because someone would happen to

1000
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,480
be really viral in that moment and

1001
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,480
you're at a party and they're sharing

1002
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,930
bottles or glasses and you get your

1003
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,150
first EBV and you're at now your your

1004
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,190
breast implants they become a trigger

1005
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,619
because they're just like having saying

1006
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,940
toxic heavy metals in your body it's

1007
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,920
just like having something else in your

1008
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,280
body and you know the toxins I talked

1009
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,839
about in cleanse the heel which I cover

1010
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,710
toxins like no one's ever known about

1011
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:55,859
what's inside our body all the way to to

1012
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,390
just luggage went in the airport on how

1013
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,550
you have to throw away your your

1014
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,579
carry-ons after you've gone through the

1015
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:05,819
airports for a few trips cuz the amount

1016
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:07,380
of radiation that's in the carry-on and

1017
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,970
you don't want that near your child you

1018
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,290
don't want that you know sitting by your

1019
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,520
bed at night you don't want that you

1020
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,780
want to throw away your carry-ons

1021
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,010
eventually

1022
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,200
so I tell people don't get real

1023
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,760
expensive carry-ons because you're gonna

1024
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,780
need to toss it after a couple of trip

1025
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,910
few trips good to know radiation but the

1026
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,650
point is is that all these toxins were

1027
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:28,020
dealing with our triggers and breast

1028
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:32,480
implants it's just it's like that it's

1029
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:36,090
one of those triggers it's a big trigger

1030
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:40,560
and I was so happy to get rid of them

1031
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:43,230
and the surgery was was big I already

1032
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:48,090
said that and I recovered so fast year

1033
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:54,270
before that in 2016 I had appendicitis

1034
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:57,720
and surgery as well and I need five

1035
00:46:54,270 --> 00:47:02,180
months to recover from that surgery ages

1036
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:07,500
it took me so long it was before my my

1037
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:11,910
breast surgery so the surgery for the

1038
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:14,880
appendix was half a year before and I

1039
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:19,310
had so many trouble to to recover from

1040
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:23,900
that because I've got anti buttocks and

1041
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:26,400
antibiotics after surgery and all

1042
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,660
streptococcus and my body said hooray

1043
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,980
let's have a party

1044
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:38,850
in this girl so streptococcus is a big

1045
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:40,830
big part and huge yeah doctor so know

1046
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,000
it's a streptococcus they don't know

1047
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,190
they don't know they don't know that

1048
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,360
that's they know that yeah that you've

1049
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,590
learned that from them that mean

1050
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,900
information because that's the whole

1051
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,840
thing in the strep groups are what

1052
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,520
causes our our appendix to get inflamed

1053
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,530
for so long that's those strep groups

1054
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,720
and you know from sinuses the tonsils

1055
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:09,090
to-to-to sore throats mystery mysterious

1056
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:14,490
sore throats - - bloating reflux strep

1057
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:16,380
is behind so I still have acne after

1058
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,120
surgery it's amazing you know every time

1059
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,610
every time a friend will be like you

1060
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,650
know I was watching a YouTube or I was I

1061
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,210
was on social media and there's another

1062
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,480
person talking about their acne and how

1063
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,270
you know

1064
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,329
and they don't have a single clue their

1065
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,740
acnes caused by streptococcus and

1066
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:35,770
they're just getting information from

1067
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:38,079
either some type of practitioner or

1068
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,430
their doctor or a health coach and

1069
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,170
they're just telling them oh it's your

1070
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:46,299
hormones or use this cream or or change

1071
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,920
this food but not know why it could help

1072
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:50,770
or not help or might help but might not

1073
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,150

like you know there's still a new person

1083
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,130
on YouTube now open another ten more

1084
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:14,079
people saying it's hormones or something

1085
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:16,990
so may I ask you a question at symmetric

1086
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,240
caucus is it is it about what is about

1087
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,760
beans and lentils when it comes to

1088
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:25,180
streptococcus well what it is what it is

1089
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,609
this is is beans lentils they don't feed

1090
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,950
viruses and pathogens so beans and

1091
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:33,549
grains don't feed those those kinds of

1092
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:36,730
beans like lentils and and dukey beans

1093
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:41,980
black beans chickpeas garbanzo beans

1094
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:43,450
they don't feed bugs and and grains like

1095
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:47,500
millet okay

1096
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:49,420
and even oats don't feed bugs but but

1097
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,170
they still if you're eating too much of

1098
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,869
it they don't offer Oh enough nutrition

1099
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,829
so you're taking up so much space

1100
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:58,869
because they don't offer that much

1101
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:00,910
nutrition I mean compared to feed you

1102
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:03,190
could meet it and that's one thing right

1103
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,200
there it's really important no but but

1104
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:08,530
gluten based grains are the ones that

1105
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,819
feed viruses they feed pathogens and all

1106
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:13,299
that it's just that when you're eating

1107
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:15,970
too many grains too much rice you're

1108
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:17,319
taking up a lot of space for what you

1109
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:19,480
can you know and I talked about it all

1110
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:21,339
and cleanse the heel - all about that

1111
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,700
like all about beans and grains and

1112
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:28,690
stuff and so but Anthony coos and I I

1113
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:31,390
read that beans and vandals form mucus

1114
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:33,490
in our body yeah just that this could be

1115
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,890
a problem within some people because

1116
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,530
they're not they're not

1117
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:39,150
easily digestible because everybody's

1118
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:41,880
digestion czar just there shot

1119
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,770
everybody's hydrochloric acid stomach

1120
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,320
lands are producing the HCL their

1121
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,850
digestion is weakened their livers their

1122
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,650
livers are weakened so when you're

1123
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,560
putting you know you're putting in a lot

1124
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,420
of beans and a lot of grains they're

1125
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,310
they're they're harder to break down

1126
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,050
they're harder to digest so it's not

1127
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:00,210
that they're feeding pathogens it's just

1128
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,430
they're really hard to digest so you
