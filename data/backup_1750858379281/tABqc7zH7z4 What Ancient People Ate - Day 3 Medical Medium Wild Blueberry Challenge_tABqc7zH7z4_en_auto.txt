[289.32 - 293.10] life-changing moments from the wild
[291.48 - 295.62] blueberry juice and the wild blueberries
[293.10 - 297.60] have you been doing each MDS all these
[295.62 - 299.94] years have you been incorporating wild
[297.60 - 301.38] blueberries into your life while
[299.94 - 303.42] blueberries are different than
[301.38 - 305.28] cultivated blueberries
[303.42 - 307.14] so I want to run down a few things about
[305.28 - 308.94] that too as we get going we're talking
[307.14 - 311.40] about ancient food
[308.94 - 313.80] ancient peoples
[311.40 - 315.06] eating ancient food we're going to go
[313.80 - 317.28] into that a little bit too that's
[315.06 - 319.20] actually gonna going to be kind of fun I
[317.28 - 321.78] think going into that so I'm going to
[319.20 - 324.48] turn this waffle maker up a little bit
[321.78 - 328.38] I'm gonna get it moving because I want
[324.48 - 330.00] to get some waffles going so
[328.38 - 332.40] here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
[330.00 - 335.06] actually peel these are steamed potatoes
[332.40 - 338.04] let's get these over here I got one big
[335.06 - 339.56] bowl of steamed potatoes right there
[338.04 - 344.34] look at that you guys
[339.56 - 347.28] one big bowl of steamed potatoes really
[344.34 - 349.86] excited about this Tyler says I felt
[347.28 - 351.72] like I was glowing naturally High all
[349.86 - 354.72] morning for my wild blueberry bowl last
[351.72 - 357.90] night it gives me that feeling too like
[354.72 - 360.00] it's just a natural high but when you
[357.90 - 362.16] really break it down you're talking
[360.00 - 363.72] about a food that has survived on this
[362.16 - 366.66] planet for thousands and thousands of
[363.72 - 370.26] years it has information in it survival
[366.66 - 372.00] information it's an incredible resource
[370.26 - 374.52] the wild blueberry so it's not like
[372.00 - 377.28] having some cultivated blueberry which
[374.52 - 379.02] doesn't give us that feeling and now it
[377.28 - 381.90] never gave me that feeling of cultivated
[379.02 - 383.04] blueberry so I'm gonna peel back some of
[381.90 - 386.04] the skin
[383.04 - 387.42] I'm going to peel back some of the skin
[386.04 - 390.30] on
[387.42 - 392.70] this potato these are steamed potatoes I
[390.30 - 394.86] like doing it that way so you don't have
[392.70 - 396.24] to take all the skin off you can you
[394.86 - 398.64] know but I like doing it because you're
[396.24 - 400.50] making waffles and you wanted a certain
[398.64 - 402.30] texture
[400.50 - 403.86] you know that's a great way to do it so
[402.30 - 404.58] I'm going to put this right here in a
[403.86 - 407.22] bowl
[404.58 - 409.08] I'm going to peel back the skin on a
[407.22 - 410.58] bunch of them I'm going to make a few
[409.08 - 412.52] different waffles which I'm actually
[410.58 - 414.60] really excited about
[412.52 - 417.60] so you know a lot of people would be
[414.60 - 420.12] like paleo man ancient man what do they
[417.60 - 422.52] eat they eat meat meat meat that's what
[420.12 - 424.86] it was it was all about hunters hunters
[422.52 - 427.50] and gatherers but mainly Hunters
[424.86 - 429.60] surviving on meat and meat alone right
[427.50 - 431.04] you hear that all the time you know and
[429.60 - 433.02] then the vegans are like no they're
[431.04 - 435.30] Gathering they're Gathering they were
[433.02 - 436.50] surviving on Plants right you know and
[435.30 - 439.38] you know there's always that big
[436.50 - 443.10] argument right there always happening
[439.38 - 445.08] you got the animal protein side of of
[443.10 - 447.48] the health movement then you got the
[445.08 - 449.94] vegan side of the health movement
[447.48 - 452.58] you have that and then you know sad
[449.94 - 454.62] enough vegans they get scared and they
[452.58 - 457.62] run back to the animal protein movement
[454.62 - 459.42] the animal protein movement they'll do
[457.62 - 461.34] the same they'll run back the vegetarian
[459.42 - 464.58] or vegan or something but that's another
[461.34 - 467.10] story another talk for another day
[464.58 - 469.20] but what did people eat well it depends
[467.10 - 471.78] on what part of the planet they were on
[469.20 - 474.24] to begin with that's one right there
[471.78 - 476.64] that's one place to understand
[474.24 - 479.64] and that determined also a decent amount
[476.64 - 483.24] but one thing's for sure berries were
[479.64 - 485.34] growing everywhere on the planet that
[483.24 - 486.90] anything can grow so berries have always
[485.34 - 490.38] been around now
[486.90 - 492.42] wild blueberries have been here for a
[490.38 - 495.48] very very long time
[492.42 - 498.84] so now what did ancient people survive
[495.48 - 500.22] on now to begin with hunting was not a
[498.84 - 503.64] definitive
[500.22 - 505.80] factor that kept people alive back in
[503.64 - 508.68] the ancient days so keep that in mind
[505.80 - 510.96] okay because you can the amount of
[508.68 - 513.36] calories and I actually taught about
[510.96 - 517.14] this for over 35 plus years the amount
[513.36 - 521.10] of calories you needed in order to hunt
[517.14 - 524.54] was unbelievable you can't just hunt on
[521.10 - 527.04] no calories we're talking about
[524.54 - 531.54] traveling it's not like you go outside
[527.04 - 534.30] your door of your Hut or whatever your
[531.54 - 536.04] your little shelter and then you hunt it
[534.30 - 538.08] five feet away
[536.04 - 540.48] especially if the what the weather was
[538.08 - 542.64] doing hunting would take a tremendous
[540.48 - 545.52] amount of traveling where the animals
[542.64 - 550.56] were in order to hunt right and then it
[545.52 - 555.30] took physical physical strength to hunt
[550.56 - 557.70] and to rhyme right and to carry the
[555.30 - 560.04] Beast back as well so if you're hunting
[557.70 - 561.90] it took a lot of physical strength to
[560.04 - 565.26] carry the Beast back
[561.90 - 568.26] this took a lot of calories
[565.26 - 572.22] important to know so ancient people
[568.26 - 574.86] right if they relied only on Hunting it
[572.22 - 577.74] would have not survived
[574.86 - 581.58] just the way it works they would not
[577.74 - 584.70] have survived if they were relying just
[581.58 - 586.38] on hunting and hunting alone
[584.70 - 588.00] so that's an important thing to
[586.38 - 589.62] understand because a lot of people are
[588.00 - 591.30] like no it was all hunting and it was
[589.62 - 595.14] all meat
[591.30 - 596.88] but that's not accurate so then there
[595.14 - 599.64] were times where
[596.88 - 601.38] hunting was really really scarce and
[599.64 - 602.70] it's been like that on this planet over
[601.38 - 604.80] and over again
[602.70 - 606.60] so what did ancient people really
[604.80 - 610.32] survive on well first of all there was
[606.60 - 612.06] always somebody they used in the village
[610.32 - 617.52] or community
[612.06 - 620.10] to taste test poisonous plant species
[617.52 - 622.44] first and foremost there was always
[620.10 - 623.84] somebody that had to do the taste
[622.44 - 628.14] testing
[623.84 - 631.08] 98 of all the mushrooms growing on this
[628.14 - 632.22] planet throughout these centuries were
[631.08 - 634.50] toxic
[632.22 - 637.50] so there'd always be a taste tester to
[634.50 - 640.38] discover which mushroom may not be toxic
[637.50 - 643.44] in order to allow a mushroom to enter
[640.38 - 647.40] into the diet of ancient you know
[643.44 - 649.94] ancient human beings ancient people
[647.40 - 649.94] so
[649.98 - 655.74] keep that in mind same thing with
[652.32 - 659.22] berries berries were taste were taste
[655.74 - 661.32] tested along the way right now there's
[659.22 - 664.80] berries with really really dangerous
[661.32 - 667.56] alkaloids these alkaloids would kill you
[664.80 - 670.56] really quickly and sometimes kill you
[667.56 - 673.92] really really slowly so keep that in
[670.56 - 676.32] mind too so when it came down to ancient
[673.92 - 679.26] people and food it was a lot of Hit and
[676.32 - 682.08] Miss trial and error and that's what it
[679.26 - 684.96] was about for many many times for many
[682.08 - 686.94] many years thousands upon thousands of
[684.96 - 689.64] years it was like that
[686.94 - 692.36] so that's something to
[689.64 - 692.36] think about
[692.46 - 697.98] so a lot of people died
[694.86 - 700.14] trying to find their way into what was
[697.98 - 702.78] safe in The Plant World to eat now
[700.14 - 704.34] there's a lot of plant species that if
[702.78 - 707.58] consumed
[704.34 - 710.64] your liver would shut down
[707.58 - 713.40] or your kidneys would shut down
[710.64 - 715.50] a lot of plant species
[713.40 - 717.48] so it made it very difficult for
[715.50 - 720.54] survival
[717.48 - 723.18] depending on the region too
[720.54 - 725.52] so once this was figured out along the
[723.18 - 729.02] way what was safe what wasn't and there
[725.52 - 729.02] were still lots of trial by Era
[730.02 - 735.84] certain things were established certain
[732.84 - 737.72] berries were established too
[735.84 - 739.44] and that's important to know
[737.72 - 740.76] [Applause]
[739.44 - 742.68] all right so I'm just cleaning up my
[740.76 - 745.32] board a little bit I'm getting some
[742.68 - 747.54] potato it's all set right here all
[745.32 - 749.10] skinned down
[747.54 - 751.02] so what I did was I took some of the
[749.10 - 751.86] skins off right here good to see you
[751.02 - 754.14] guys
[751.86 - 755.58] I see that someone said Wyman's yep it's
[754.14 - 756.78] Wyman's that's what it is it's the wild
[755.58 - 759.66] blueberry juice
[756.78 - 761.34] is what we're using right that's the
[759.66 - 763.68] wild blueberry shots right there it's an
[761.34 - 765.24] incredible product I work with Wyman's I
[763.68 - 767.64] support them I want the stuff to stay
[765.24 - 769.08] around it's an incredible resource what
[767.64 - 772.20] it takes to get them out of the field
[769.08 - 774.60] this ancient food and then to actually
[772.20 - 778.14] press them and to get them in the bottle
[774.60 - 781.02] and what I love is all it is is wild
[778.14 - 786.92] blueberry juice and that's what I love
[781.02 - 786.92] just wild blueberry juice 10 off right
[787.76 - 791.22] foreign
[789.36 - 792.84] so nice
[791.22 - 795.12] so nice
[792.84 - 797.64] so these potatoes are already steamed
[795.12 - 802.02] keep that in mind
[797.64 - 805.68] I got the waffle iron heating up here
[802.02 - 808.44] these potatoes are already steamed and
[805.68 - 812.10] ready to go I am going to mash them
[808.44 - 813.84] but I'm going to find my Masher
[812.10 - 815.64] here they are
[813.84 - 817.20] here it is and here's the potatoes so
[815.64 - 819.96] let's go so I'm going to do a little bit
[817.20 - 821.52] of potato mashing right now
[819.96 - 824.28] now
[821.52 - 826.02] ancient people ate a lot of shoots keep
[824.28 - 829.20] that in mind
[826.02 - 832.38] paolita says we can we can get wild
[829.20 - 835.14] blueberry juice yes it's the Wyman's
[832.38 - 837.90] wild blueberry juice right there
[835.14 - 841.16] where can you get it Wyman's link is in
[837.90 - 841.16] the description link is in the profile
[841.82 - 848.60] w-y-m-a-n-s.com wines.com
[844.98 - 848.60] that's where you find it right there
[848.82 - 853.26] so
[851.06 - 855.84] shoots were something that ancient
[853.26 - 859.44] people ate what was a shoot
[855.84 - 861.90] well you got shoots You Got Roots you
[859.44 - 865.44] got rhizomes
[861.90 - 868.32] you got mushrooms you've got Twigs you
[865.44 - 871.32] got fruit like berries
[868.32 - 872.94] ancient figs
[871.32 - 876.30] depending on the region and where you
[872.94 - 878.82] are but all regions there was always
[876.30 - 881.16] some type of shoot you can eat
[878.82 - 883.38] hence like the asparagus the asparagus
[881.16 - 885.48] is a derivative from an ancient food
[883.38 - 888.06] from an ancient shoot
[885.48 - 889.32] and then you got tubers it's another one
[888.06 - 891.84] too
[889.32 - 894.12] so in these ancient Foods
[891.84 - 896.58] throughout the centuries a lot of people
[894.12 - 898.62] died trying out different rhizomes
[896.58 - 903.80] different tubers
[898.62 - 903.80] different berries different shoots
[903.84 - 907.92] to get here it was a long road for
[906.48 - 910.08] ancient people
[907.92 - 911.88] it's not something like we see now where
[910.08 - 913.50] it's pretty easy we got we have a clear
[911.88 - 916.40] understanding of what we can eat and
[913.50 - 916.40] what we can't eat
[916.70 - 921.84] and even today we eat things we're not
[919.50 - 924.24] supposed to eat after all's been said
[921.84 - 926.88] and done we still actually eat things
[924.24 - 929.34] that we're not supposed to eat how crazy
[926.88 - 932.18] is that things are actually not good for
[929.34 - 934.38] us and we still do that now
[932.18 - 935.88] when you really think about that that's
[934.38 - 937.74] amazing
[935.88 - 938.88] that's kind of funny so I'm mashing
[937.74 - 940.38] these up you guys because I'm making
[938.88 - 943.26] waffles then I'm going to make a wild
[940.38 - 945.60] blueberry sauce it's in the book right
[943.26 - 946.56] here the brain saver books just want to
[945.60 - 948.30] show you
[946.56 - 951.30] talking about ancient people but we're
[948.30 - 954.18] also making that right there
[951.30 - 956.64] excited about it check that out
[954.18 - 959.64] it's gonna be fun also making a drink
[956.64 - 961.74] honey orange wild blueberry refresher
[959.64 - 963.66] how insane is that
[961.74 - 965.88] it's gonna be really fun
[963.66 - 968.10] okay so I'm giving these guys a good
[965.88 - 970.86] Mash you don't want your waffles really
[968.10 - 973.20] lumpy you don't have to puree them
[970.86 - 975.60] that's not what you want to do you just
[973.20 - 978.24] want to break them up a little bit and
[975.60 - 980.34] mash them some potatoes are softer than
[978.24 - 983.34] the others this one right here is a
[980.34 - 986.16] really firm potato the waffle recipe is
[983.34 - 987.72] in the book Brain saver I'm gonna be
[986.16 - 988.98] reading out a brain saver it's in the
[987.72 - 991.32] protocols book
[988.98 - 992.88] so I'm excited
[991.32 - 996.74] so let me just now she's a little bit
[992.88 - 996.74] more gonna make some good waffles
[1000.02 - 1003.62] so
[1001.10 - 1005.42] what did ancient man eat well Ancient
[1003.62 - 1007.60] Man didn't survive on meat and meat
[1005.42 - 1007.60] alone
[1007.64 - 1012.38] if that was
[1009.44 - 1013.76] the only option very little survival
[1012.38 - 1016.40] would happen
[1013.76 - 1019.34] so would often would often would occur
[1016.40 - 1022.16] is the drying of things
[1019.34 - 1025.34] so the way we survived and got here
[1022.16 - 1028.22] today it was from drying
[1025.34 - 1030.80] trying everything and anything that's
[1028.22 - 1033.56] what it was about
[1030.80 - 1037.18] okay we're just about there here just
[1033.56 - 1037.18] about there there we go
[1037.88 - 1041.48] all right all right all right crashed
[1039.68 - 1043.82] crash
[1041.48 - 1045.50] but that's why I like being live
[1043.82 - 1047.48] you know I wake up in the morning I'll
[1045.50 - 1049.82] tell SOC you think I'll let like knock
[1047.48 - 1051.68] stuff over today
[1049.82 - 1053.06] so she's like trying not to I'm like no
[1051.68 - 1055.58] let's hope I do
[1053.06 - 1058.40] all right
[1055.58 - 1061.72] so let's make some waffles
[1058.40 - 1061.72] yeah oops
[1063.86 - 1068.30] so I'm gonna actually make these into
[1065.90 - 1070.58] like a little ball I'm gonna put them
[1068.30 - 1073.60] into the waffle iron I'm gonna bring the
[1070.58 - 1073.60] waffle iron up here
[1074.42 - 1079.04] we are alive
[1077.30 - 1081.32] all right now I don't want this too big
[1079.04 - 1084.26] because if this is a small waffle maker
[1081.32 - 1087.08] these waffles are like thin
[1084.26 - 1090.08] if I make it too big
[1087.08 - 1093.88] it's just gonna be like trouble so I'm
[1090.08 - 1093.88] thinking that's probably it right there
[1096.38 - 1103.60] yeah nice all right
[1100.10 - 1103.60] see if we could drop something else
[1104.36 - 1109.10] oh sorry about that

[1129.22 - 1134.98] this waffle iron is
[1132.14 - 1134.98] getting hot
[1136.34 - 1143.32] it's flip hot
[1139.10 - 1143.32] all right we're gonna pop this in here
[1146.30 - 1149.20] you guys it was just
[1149.60 - 1154.52] if you just got here
[1152.96 - 1155.78] day three of the wild blueberry
[1154.52 - 1158.24] challenge
[1155.78 - 1162.94] day three
[1158.24 - 1162.94] magically appeared or some of these
[1165.14 - 1170.54] all right I'm gonna throw this in here
[1168.62 - 1172.78] I can't help it I like to throw stuff in
[1170.54 - 1172.78] the air
[1180.02 - 1184.70] let's just
[1182.36 - 1186.38] turn this around in a second but first I
[1184.70 - 1187.52] have to do this before I do that so I'm
[1186.38 - 1188.78] going to show you guys I'm going to
[1187.52 - 1191.24] knock this
[1188.78 - 1194.44] together now I might have made this one
[1191.24 - 1194.44] too big of a waffle
[1197.72 - 1201.50] do you guys like waffles these are
[1199.64 - 1203.90] potato waffles
[1201.50 - 1206.18] they're more than gluten free they're
[1203.90 - 1208.04] grain free for people that are really
[1206.18 - 1211.36] worried about grains
[1208.04 - 1211.36] they're grain free
[1215.00 - 1220.76] if you listen to my alien podcast
[1217.82 - 1222.98] you guys medical medium
[1220.76 - 1225.82] podcasts at Apple podcast did you listen
[1222.98 - 1225.82] to the alien episode
[1227.42 - 1231.26] that's an interesting episode it's got
[1229.52 - 1233.54] good information in there
[1231.26 - 1235.16] it's actually really cool
[1233.54 - 1238.42] all right I'm gonna see what I got here
[1235.16 - 1238.42] I'm not gonna open this up yet
[1239.12 - 1243.26] I'm just pushing it down a little bit I
[1241.34 - 1246.64] put more
[1243.26 - 1246.64] batter in that one
[1250.06 - 1254.80] grab myself another hand towel
[1255.20 - 1260.80] all right cool
[1257.30 - 1260.80] so I'm going to make another two
[1261.08 - 1264.62] we got a couple to do
[1262.94 - 1268.64] so
[1264.62 - 1272.14] let's get back to ancient people's talk
[1268.64 - 1272.14] let's talk a little bit more
[1275.30 - 1280.34] survival depended on drying things
[1278.42 - 1282.80] bottom line
[1280.34 - 1285.44] wild blueberries were picked
[1282.80 - 1287.24] during season
[1285.44 - 1291.80] and then dried
[1287.24 - 1291.80] before winter approached
[1291.98 - 1296.96] if it was climate that was still
[1294.02 - 1299.66] somewhat tropical or subtropical winter
[1296.96 - 1302.96] still approached Seasons still change in
[1299.66 - 1306.44] subtropical conditions places
[1302.96 - 1308.30] regardless wherever the berry was picked
[1306.44 - 1309.86] they were dried now certain berries
[1308.30 - 1313.70] don't dry good
[1309.86 - 1314.92] so if it's a wild raspberry it's not a
[1313.70 - 1317.00] great
[1314.92 - 1319.82] drying Berry
[1317.00 - 1323.00] not a great survival
[1319.82 - 1325.46] tool but yet all berries were dried for
[1323.00 - 1328.54] the most part but not only that other
[1325.46 - 1328.54] things were dried too
[1328.82 - 1333.94] that's how survival happens I'm just
[1330.86 - 1333.94] getting another waffle ready
[1335.18 - 1338.44] just rinsing my hands
[1344.96 - 1349.94] if berries didn't exist on this planet
[1347.30 - 1354.02] there's a good chance
[1349.94 - 1357.14] we may not have made it this far
[1354.02 - 1359.24] because ancient people had to rely on
[1357.14 - 1362.08] drying berries in order to make it
[1359.24 - 1362.08] through seasons
[1362.68 - 1367.70] here's a dried Berry right here here's
[1365.54 - 1369.44] the Wyman's whole dried wild berries
[1367.70 - 1372.08] which is really cool too by the way
[1369.44 - 1374.74] check it out what did it look like let
[1372.08 - 1374.74] me open this up
[1382.46 - 1386.14] I'm gonna move my waffle maker over
[1390.62 - 1396.16] want to look at these wild dried berries
[1393.68 - 1396.16] right here
[1398.00 - 1402.74] so that's how survival really happened
[1400.40 - 1406.34] right there branching people
[1402.74 - 1408.44] it was drying things and then carrying
[1406.34 - 1411.04] with you as you traveled all the dried
[1408.44 - 1411.04] items
[1412.28 - 1417.82] these are the dried Wild lubers
[1414.98 - 1417.82] pretty awesome
[1418.94 - 1422.36] Theresa says thank you for making these
[1420.62 - 1425.42] videos I want to make these videos I
[1422.36 - 1426.98] want you guys to have information
[1425.42 - 1429.62] I want you to be able to watch these
[1426.98 - 1431.42] again if you wanted to I like the recipe
[1429.62 - 1432.74] videos and that's what this kind of is
[1431.42 - 1435.22] in the end really I'm making some
[1432.74 - 1435.22] waffles
[1435.50 - 1440.06] I think I gotta make the sauce that I
[1438.08 - 1441.92] have to do pretty soon have you guys
[1440.06 - 1444.08] tried the wild blueberries have you
[1441.92 - 1445.94] tried the wild blueberry juice what have
[1444.08 - 1447.92] you experienced I know what I
[1445.94 - 1451.40] experienced when I have it
[1447.92 - 1454.46] host any real stories or anything else
[1451.40 - 1456.08] or posts of any kind and I at Medical
[1454.46 - 1458.00] medium or tag at Medical medium or
[1456.08 - 1461.68] hashtag medical medium whatever do both
[1458.00 - 1461.68] so I could see it and then repost it
[1463.34 - 1467.72] guys don't mind right
[1465.50 - 1470.42] getting a little tipsy that's why I'm
[1467.72 - 1473.06] knocking everything over
[1470.42 - 1477.76] Dr nesmet might show up later
[1473.06 - 1477.76] wants to do an examination on hoot
[1480.02 - 1485.08] ew's Bar and Grill is getting pretty
[1482.00 - 1485.08] messy over here

[1489.50 - 1492.68] I'd never heard you so quiet it's the
[1491.60 - 1496.54] craziest thing
[1492.68 - 1496.54] Hoots usually making a lot of noise
[1502.10 - 1507.50] okay I think I also need

[1507.50 - 1510.88] a glass of wine
[1512.20 - 1516.80] it's getting crazy in here I think I
[1515.24 - 1518.84] need a glass of wine too because who
[1516.80 - 1520.70] wants a glass of wine that's it you

[1543.08 - 1546.82] apparently
[1544.28 - 1549.02] glass of wine
[1546.82 - 1550.70] all right let's get into it a little bit
[1549.02 - 1552.14] I want to read a little bit out of brain
[1550.70 - 1554.68] saver
[1552.14 - 1554.68] perfect
[1557.38 - 1562.66] all right
[1559.34 - 1562.66] let's go you guys
[1565.70 - 1569.44] waffle is not done yet
[1575.54 - 1579.82] you guys you know
[1577.88 - 1582.50] it's always like this at aw's kitchen
[1579.82 - 1585.02] that's all I could say all right so I'm
[1582.50 - 1586.76] on page 93 right here I got the brain
[1585.02 - 1589.22] saver book have you checked out the
[1586.76 - 1590.84] brain saver books anybody new here that
[1589.22 - 1592.58] hasn't seen the brain saver books both
[1590.84 - 1594.20] the protocols book and this one right
[1592.58 - 1597.20] here there's two which is really one
[1594.20 - 1599.24] it's a huge book originally publisher
[1597.20 - 1601.88] couldn't publish it they couldn't do it
[1599.24 - 1603.26] the printing was too hard became two
[1601.88 - 1605.54] massive books filled with information
[1603.26 - 1608.18] packed with information
[1605.54 - 1610.10] and so these are the brain saver books
[1608.18 - 1611.78] right here this is one of them a reading
[1610.10 - 1613.40] out of it Amazon's selling them right
[1611.78 - 1615.82] now get them for gifts for friends and
[1613.40 - 1618.68] family you guys are 40 off right now
[1615.82 - 1619.82] amazon.com us which is really incredible
[1618.68 - 1622.88] and
[1619.82 - 1624.92] I am happy about that so every day so
[1622.88 - 1627.80] I'm reading page 93
[1624.92 - 1630.74] so we'll get into it right now
[1627.80 - 1633.14] everyday toxins and poisons inside the
[1630.74 - 1635.66] brain are a large part of the brain's
[1633.14 - 1639.62] limitations we experience so if someone
[1635.66 - 1641.66] has a brain limitation of any kind
[1639.62 - 1645.02] we're talking about toxins and poisons
[1641.66 - 1649.10] inside our brain so if somebody has a
[1645.02 - 1652.36] brain limitation of any kind
[1649.10 - 1652.36] we're dealing with
[1652.76 - 1657.46] some kind of toxin or poison that's
[1654.68 - 1657.46] inside the brain
[1660.08 - 1664.40] we experience so including emotional
[1662.48 - 1666.26] limitations so if someone has emotional
[1664.40 - 1668.78] limitations we got something that's
[1666.26 - 1670.88] inside the brain that's in the way if we
[1668.78 - 1673.94] have an emotional limitation
[1670.88 - 1677.36] this is mind-blowing information to me
[1673.94 - 1680.72] if an area of the brain is clouded
[1677.36 - 1682.34] with an abundant level of poisons and
[1680.72 - 1684.92] toxins
[1682.34 - 1687.56] ranging from toxic heavy metals to
[1684.92 - 1690.50] solvents to Plastics and other
[1687.56 - 1692.54] petrochemicals to Pharmaceuticals
[1690.50 - 1695.48] that have been there for 20 years 30
[1692.54 - 1697.82] years to air fresheners
[1695.48 - 1700.58] to fragrances descented candles which
[1697.82 - 1703.94] get into the brain and beyond that area
[1700.58 - 1705.80] of the brain that's clouded with these
[1703.94 - 1708.68] brain betrayers
[1705.80 - 1711.26] can almost go into a sleep mode
[1708.68 - 1714.62] so what that means is if there's an area
[1711.26 - 1717.38] of the brain filled with enough garbage
[1714.62 - 1719.30] enough Pharmaceuticals enough toxins
[1717.38 - 1722.30] enough poisons enough anything right
[1719.30 - 1724.00] heavy metals petrochemicals all the
[1722.30 - 1726.32] different stuff are up against chemicals
[1724.00 - 1727.64] chemical solvents everything that we
[1726.32 - 1729.62] breathe in every day everything we're
[1727.64 - 1732.62] exposed to if there's an area in the
[1729.62 - 1736.10] brain that's filled with enough of that
[1732.62 - 1739.46] it can actually put that area of the
[1736.10 - 1742.04] brain into sleep mode it dumbs that part
[1739.46 - 1744.14] of the brain down and puts it into sleep
[1742.04 - 1745.52] mode
[1744.14 - 1747.98] it's incredible because you don't hear
[1745.52 - 1749.96] that from research in science you don't
[1747.98 - 1753.20] hear that from anywhere
[1749.96 - 1755.24] it's just amazing information so this
[1753.20 - 1756.26] doesn't mean we'll be sleeping so it
[1755.24 - 1757.94] doesn't mean you're always going to be
[1756.26 - 1760.58] sleeping just because you might have a
[1757.94 - 1763.10] toxin or poison deep into the brain
[1760.58 - 1764.54] someplace into this area where it's
[1763.10 - 1765.92] actually putting that area into sleep
[1764.54 - 1767.96] mode it doesn't mean that now you're
[1765.92 - 1770.00] going to be sleeping
[1767.96 - 1771.26] or that waffle smelling good at this
[1770.00 - 1773.72] point
[1771.26 - 1776.36] it means an area of our brain is not
[1773.72 - 1777.80] functioning optimally so that means an
[1776.36 - 1778.64] area of the brain is not functioning
[1777.80 - 1782.00] good
[1778.64 - 1783.26] so we'll rely more on other parts of our
[1782.00 - 1787.10] brain
[1783.26 - 1789.92] whoa see so when stuff gets gunked up
[1787.10 - 1794.60] and junked up inside our brain we end up
[1789.92 - 1797.66] relying on another part of our brain
[1794.60 - 1800.00] that's less clouded and clogged up with
[1797.66 - 1801.92] toxins it also means we'll be limited in
[1800.00 - 1803.18] brain function you see a lot of people
[1801.92 - 1804.74] out there they're struggling you've got
[1803.18 - 1806.24] the brain fog they got all the different
[1804.74 - 1809.18] brain conditions right they're
[1806.24 - 1811.64] struggling because they're limited
[1809.18 - 1814.96] because their brain is not functioning
[1811.64 - 1814.96] the way it needs to function
[1815.54 - 1819.62] in 10 years
[1817.40 - 1821.36] you guys are going to see it
[1819.62 - 1822.50] a lot of people's brains aren't going to
[1821.36 - 1826.46] be working
[1822.50 - 1828.14] five years now it's really kicking up
[1826.46 - 1830.66] when emotional centers of the brain
[1828.14 - 1832.64] become filled up and cladded with toxins
[1830.66 - 1834.68] and poisons now that's the emotional
[1832.64 - 1837.02] centers of the brain you guys that's an
[1834.68 - 1839.72] entirely different area of the brain
[1837.02 - 1841.88] we become more reliant on other parts of
[1839.72 - 1844.76] our brain as a result we can become
[1841.88 - 1846.74] limited in our emotional understanding
[1844.76 - 1849.26] of others
[1846.74 - 1850.88] that's when we can't really understand
[1849.26 - 1853.82] others
[1850.88 - 1856.10] because in our emotional center of the
[1853.82 - 1859.10] brain there's some type of contamination
[1856.10 - 1861.98] and that contamination can make it so we
[1859.10 - 1863.18] can't be understanding on any level to
[1861.98 - 1865.16] others
[1863.18 - 1867.34] right do you ever hear those stories out
[1865.16 - 1867.34] there
[1868.46 - 1873.22] Waffle's still cooking do you ever hear
[1870.26 - 1873.22] those stories out there
[1873.26 - 1876.92] where it's like
[1874.82 - 1879.74] the person to be like
[1876.92 - 1882.26] my parents just don't understand me they
[1879.74 - 1885.32] just don't get it or my stepdad doesn't
[1882.26 - 1886.94] get it or you know somebody that my
[1885.32 - 1889.88] stepmom doesn't get it
[1886.94 - 1891.50] or my uncle doesn't get it my aunt
[1889.88 - 1893.84] doesn't get it my brother doesn't get it
[1891.50 - 1895.82] my sister doesn't get it and you ever
[1893.84 - 1897.62] hear those stories out there it's like
[1895.82 - 1899.12] you know the person's like going through
[1897.62 - 1901.40] a lot they're struggling they're
[1899.12 - 1904.46] suffering they've been through a lot but
[1901.40 - 1906.98] for some reason siblings or family or
[1904.46 - 1910.16] friends or best friends just don't get
[1906.98 - 1913.10] it or understand at all what's going on
[1910.16 - 1915.98] because that person that sibling that
[1913.10 - 1918.56] Mom that Dad that the uncle that best
[1915.98 - 1920.54] friend that partner whoever it is has
[1918.56 - 1922.16] something clouding up that emotional
[1920.54 - 1923.96] center of the brain you guys are reading
[1922.16 - 1925.82] brain saver right now
[1923.96 - 1928.04] which is Incredible Book to get to
[1925.82 - 1930.38] people for the holidays and everything
[1928.04 - 1933.16] both these books
[1930.38 - 1933.16] two books
[1934.16 - 1939.74] so we can become Limited in getting in
[1937.28 - 1941.90] touch with our emotional state we can
[1939.74 - 1944.18] become Limited in feeling and expressing
[1941.90 - 1947.12] emotions Limited in harnessing emotions
[1944.18 - 1949.64] too so if it happens to us it happens to
[1947.12 - 1951.08] you it happens to anybody then all of a
[1949.64 - 1953.84] sudden it's hard to even get in touch
[1951.08 - 1956.72] with your own emotional state
[1953.84 - 1959.00] you feel like you're always just lost in
[1956.72 - 1960.32] that depersonalization kicks in too and
[1959.00 - 1962.30] that's what happens when also
[1960.32 - 1965.14] contaminants get into the emotional
[1962.30 - 1965.14] centers of the brain
[1965.18 - 1969.32] toxins and poisons clogging up the
[1967.52 - 1971.42] emotional centers of our brain can also
[1969.32 - 1973.82] mean that we become extremely emotional
[1971.42 - 1975.74] without understanding why how about that
[1973.82 - 1977.66] she ever meet anybody they get really
[1975.74 - 1979.28] emotional they don't know why so now
[1977.66 - 1980.54] they're going to somebody else to see
[1979.28 - 1982.28] they're going to see a past life
[1980.54 - 1984.14] regressionist now they're going to see a
[1982.28 - 1985.64] therapist now they're going to see
[1984.14 - 1987.08] somebody else now they're going they're
[1985.64 - 1988.28] just like they're searching and
[1987.08 - 1990.74] searching
[1988.28 - 1992.54] because they don't understand why they
[1990.74 - 1995.54] become extremely emotional and they
[1992.54 - 1997.70] don't know why so they want answers
[1995.54 - 1999.86] sometimes they get the answer that like
[1997.70 - 2001.66] you know 300 years ago they were Queen
[1999.86 - 2005.22] Victoria or queen somebody and they got
[2001.66 - 2005.22] their heads chopped off and that's why
[2005.32 - 2009.52] in a past life and that's why they're so
[2007.42 - 2011.86] emotional because no one knows why
[2009.52 - 2013.06] someone really is struggling emotionally
[2011.86 - 2014.26] like that they don't know that inside
[2013.06 - 2016.12] the brain
[2014.26 - 2017.92] they got old Pharmaceuticals sitting in
[2016.12 - 2019.24] there they got toxic heavy metal sitting
[2017.92 - 2021.10] there they got all these other things
[2019.24 - 2023.32] that are sitting inside the brain and
[2021.10 - 2025.42] brain stem getting in the way nobody
[2023.32 - 2028.12] knows so we got to come up with all
[2025.42 - 2030.58] kinds of you know cool things I'm not
[2028.12 - 2032.92] saying whatever I'm just saying that it
[2030.58 - 2035.62] happens a lot
[2032.92 - 2037.66] Reggie Natura says that was me before
[2035.62 - 2040.00] medical medium
[2037.66 - 2042.10] dreams can become very intense it's
[2040.00 - 2044.32] another thing that happens too extremely
[2042.10 - 2046.24] emotionally challenging where constant
[2044.32 - 2048.64] dream After Dream After Dream evokes
[2046.24 - 2050.50] emotions because the body is trying to
[2048.64 - 2053.26] heal the emotional centers of the brain
[2050.50 - 2055.18] so if you ever have struggling dreams it
[2053.26 - 2057.34] depends on where all the toxins and the
[2055.18 - 2059.02] poisons and everything is all inside the
[2057.34 - 2060.88] brain and where and what part of the
[2059.02 - 2064.80] emotional centers of the brain
[2060.88 - 2064.80] but if you've ever had this
[2065.50 - 2069.88] um there's there's a reason why that we
[2068.32 - 2071.98] dream like we do because our body is
[2069.88 - 2074.34] trying to out override it to do some
[2071.98 - 2074.34] healing
[2078.46 - 2083.08] so Ruth says there are people with
[2080.62 - 2086.50] limited emotional intelligence
[2083.08 - 2087.94] but seriously it is not always so
[2086.50 - 2089.68] there's people with limited emotional
[2087.94 - 2093.76] intelligence
[2089.68 - 2096.22] everybody has Intelligence number one so
[2093.76 - 2097.42] that's there
[2096.22 - 2099.04] um that's not what you're saying that's
[2097.42 - 2100.66] what I'm saying so your comment is there
[2099.04 - 2103.12] are people with limited emotional
[2100.66 - 2105.82] intelligence but seriously it is not
[2103.12 - 2107.20] always about nutrition
[2105.82 - 2109.96] but I know that's not always about
[2107.20 - 2112.24] nutrition though it is talk though it is
[2109.96 - 2114.64] toxic
[2112.24 - 2119.16] we have many so toxic is what you mean
[2114.64 - 2119.16] we have many paths that are connected
[2119.32 - 2123.88] I'm not saying it's all about nutrition
[2121.72 - 2127.78] medical medium information
[2123.88 - 2129.64] is a vast amount of information so Ruth
[2127.78 - 2130.60] what I what I recommend is you get the
[2129.64 - 2132.76] books
[2130.60 - 2135.10] did the brain saver books maybe cleanse
[2132.76 - 2136.66] the heel tube maybe live a rescue and
[2135.10 - 2140.32] learn about the incredible information
[2136.66 - 2142.60] here including Soul information
[2140.32 - 2146.14] including
[2142.60 - 2147.58] you know other information too
[2146.14 - 2149.50] but thank you for your comment and I'm
[2147.58 - 2150.76] glad you're here I appreciate it and by
[2149.50 - 2151.90] the way you're at the free Wild
[2150.76 - 2153.94] blueberry
[2151.90 - 2156.52] challenge were day three we're making
[2153.94 - 2158.38] wild blueberries it's an incredible food
[2156.52 - 2160.18] and you might want to get some wild
[2158.38 - 2161.92] blueberries sign up for the challenge
[2160.18 - 2163.66] too and you could actually get your free
[2161.92 - 2164.98] grocery list and know what you need and
[2163.66 - 2166.72] all that other stuff for it and you
[2164.98 - 2168.82] could even re-watch the episodes at
[2166.72 - 2171.16] medicalmedium.com
[2168.82 - 2173.50] but what I recommend is getting some of
[2171.16 - 2176.14] this inside of you so it gets to the
[2173.50 - 2178.12] brain so then when you grab the medical
[2176.14 - 2180.88] medium books Ruth
[2178.12 - 2183.28] it'll help you actually open up so you
[2180.88 - 2185.62] know what you're reading
[2183.28 - 2186.76] Ruth says I think the information is
[2185.62 - 2189.64] valid
[2186.76 - 2192.76] well then guess what I am
[2189.64 - 2194.56] I am proven wrong
[2192.76 - 2196.00] and proven right
[2194.56 - 2198.58] thank you
[2196.00 - 2201.34] I'm proven both
[2198.58 - 2203.38] proven wrong because I'm saying that you
[2201.34 - 2206.44] need wild blueberry juice
[2203.38 - 2209.22] and proven right because you said that
[2206.44 - 2209.22] you like the information
[2209.32 - 2212.20] um
[2210.40 - 2214.78] Ruth I need some more wild blueberry
[2212.20 - 2216.46] juice that's what I think
[2214.78 - 2218.62] Brett Winters and by the way thank you
[2216.46 - 2220.42] for your comment once again
[2218.62 - 2222.40] Brett Winters aw what's the difference
[2220.42 - 2224.32] between what you're talking about and
[2222.40 - 2226.36] narcissism
[2224.32 - 2230.98] what's the difference
[2226.36 - 2234.04] well it all depends narcissism
[2230.98 - 2235.66] is one aspect of how the brain works if
[2234.04 - 2237.28] someone actually has problems but the
[2235.66 - 2239.02] soul is always connected too because you
[2237.28 - 2240.70] have four things going on so the problem
[2239.02 - 2243.28] is with the brain and I talk about that
[2240.70 - 2245.98] in the brain saver books
[2243.28 - 2247.24] is you have your subconscious mind your
[2245.98 - 2249.46] conscious mind
[2247.24 - 2252.34] your physical brain and your soul they
[2249.46 - 2253.90] all have to work together
[2252.34 - 2256.08] in here
[2253.90 - 2259.90] okay then that's critical to know
[2256.08 - 2261.88] narcissism can be a blend of problems
[2259.90 - 2263.56] so keep that in mind
[2261.88 - 2265.72] and a narcissist
[2263.56 - 2267.40] could also be a good person
[2265.72 - 2270.88] so it doesn't mean they're a bad
[2267.40 - 2272.92] narcissist versus a good narcissist so
[2270.88 - 2274.06] keep that in mind too so all these
[2272.92 - 2276.88] things matter
[2274.06 - 2279.46] because that's about the soul
[2276.88 - 2281.92] Soul subconscious mind conscious mind
[2279.46 - 2284.14] and physical brain all these things
[2281.92 - 2285.88] combine change everything
[2284.14 - 2287.08] and then the Free Will changes
[2285.88 - 2289.72] everything
[2287.08 - 2293.26] amongst all of it you can have a very
[2289.72 - 2295.60] evil narcissist out there
[2293.26 - 2298.60] because they're free will
[2295.60 - 2301.06] is allowing it or you can have someone
[2298.60 - 2302.86] using their free will to be a good
[2301.06 - 2305.38] narcissist
[2302.86 - 2306.70] it's so vast the understanding and
[2305.38 - 2308.74] what's happening
[2306.70 - 2311.32] one thing for sure
[2308.74 - 2314.56] if someone cleans up their brain
[2311.32 - 2316.72] and they repair neuron damage
[2314.56 - 2320.86] and they were already a bad narcissist
[2316.72 - 2324.10] they might become a good narcissist
[2320.86 - 2326.58] all right Free Will is the key Serena
[2324.10 - 2326.58] said it
[2326.86 - 2330.22] so
[2328.36 - 2333.46] first of all I better get this waffle
[2330.22 - 2335.44] out of the out of the waffle iron and
[2333.46 - 2336.76] Ruth back to you thank you for actually
[2335.44 - 2338.08] your comment and everything it was
[2336.76 - 2340.06] really nice
[2338.08 - 2343.92] okay
[2340.06 - 2343.92] I'm gonna get a plate out right now
[2349.72 - 2353.64] and I'm going to get a waffle out
[2355.18 - 2358.92] you're not making a lot of noise
[2364.36 - 2367.92] all right can you guys see this
[2369.46 - 2373.56] I'm gonna open this up
[2371.38 - 2373.56] foreign

[2376.36 - 2381.04] doing this and then we're gonna make
[2378.04 - 2384.34] that's that's a nice waffle nice and
[2381.04 - 2387.40] crispy it's hot

[2387.40 - 2394.06] it's dairy free
[2390.40 - 2397.06] what else is it it's grain free
[2394.06 - 2399.22] it's a potato waffle
[2397.06 - 2401.50] it looks amazing
[2399.22 - 2403.32] and I can't wait to
[2401.50 - 2406.66] eat it so
[2403.32 - 2407.62] crispy and hot I'm gonna put that in the
[2406.66 - 2411.24] place
[2407.62 - 2411.24] I'm gonna pop this in now
[2412.18 - 2417.96] so let's make another
[2414.54 - 2417.96] drop that down

[2421.84 - 2425.56] right I mean isn't that waffle doesn't
[2423.34 - 2427.90] it look good I can't wait to put the
[2425.56 - 2429.70] wild blueberry sauce on it to be honest
[2427.90 - 2431.88] I'm actually really looking forward to
[2429.70 - 2431.88] it
[2434.56 - 2437.98] guys I see people asking I do have a
[2436.72 - 2440.32] supplements directory on medical
[2437.98 - 2444.24] medium.com where I have kitchen tools as
[2440.32 - 2444.24] well on medical medium.com check it out
[2444.52 - 2449.44] foreign so I'm just kind of pushing this
[2447.22 - 2452.10] down squeezing that waffle out so it
[2449.44 - 2452.10] actually moves around
[2452.62 - 2458.58] okay
[2454.84 - 2458.58] place it back over here
[2462.52 - 2466.20] just want more than one waffle
[2472.66 - 2476.58] how's that look you guys see that on
[2474.40 - 2476.58] there
[2477.22 - 2480.70] all right
[2479.44 - 2482.26] all right all right let's go back to the
[2480.70 - 2485.68] book too you guys I'm reading out a
[2482.26 - 2487.90] brain saver right here
[2485.68 - 2490.96] I'm excited about these books have you
[2487.90 - 2492.76] had a chance to find them over 100
[2490.96 - 2495.16] recipes I'm making some of the recipes
[2492.76 - 2497.92] the wild blueberry recipes in here as
[2495.16 - 2499.66] you can see Wild blueberry is a big part
[2497.92 - 2504.70] of the books
[2499.66 - 2504.70] in some way shape or form because
[2505.00 - 2511.06] of the power of the wild blueberry it's
[2507.70 - 2512.50] really incredible food it's a wild food
[2511.06 - 2514.00] and so I want to talk about this one
[2512.50 - 2515.14] thing because people still bring this up
[2514.00 - 2516.70] they say
[2515.14 - 2519.46] wait a minute is the Wyman's wild
[2516.70 - 2521.08] blueberry juice is it organic so let's
[2519.46 - 2524.16] cover that for a couple of seconds too
[2521.08 - 2524.16] because I did it the other day
[2524.74 - 2529.18] so here's how it works with organic
[2527.32 - 2532.06] farming
[2529.18 - 2533.50] the crops can't protect themselves they
[2532.06 - 2534.70] don't have the ability to protect
[2533.50 - 2537.22] themselves
[2534.70 - 2539.92] so they have to be sprayed constantly
[2537.22 - 2542.68] so when it comes down to organic crops
[2539.92 - 2545.98] they have to spray the crops many times
[2542.68 - 2547.84] three times a week in many cases
[2545.98 - 2549.78] so keep that in mind
[2547.84 - 2552.04] so when it comes down to organic food
[2549.78 - 2555.76] organic food has to be continually
[2552.04 - 2557.50] sprayed in order for you to get
[2555.76 - 2560.38] something out of it
[2557.50 - 2561.82] if they don't continually spray
[2560.38 - 2564.10] you're not going to get the food you
[2561.82 - 2567.16] want it's not going to look good it's
[2564.10 - 2571.06] not going to be good now organic crops
[2567.16 - 2574.36] are sprayed with nicotine and copper
[2571.06 - 2577.84] keep that in mind Copper's toxic
[2574.36 - 2580.12] they're not using a trace mineral Copper
[2577.84 - 2581.92] from a fruit or a vegetable that
[2580.12 - 2585.58] naturally has it happens to be there
[2581.92 - 2587.14] they're using industrialized copper in
[2585.58 - 2591.10] the organic sprays
[2587.14 - 2592.36] with nicotine and other things like MSG
[2591.10 - 2595.36] now
[2592.36 - 2597.76] when they spray organic crops
[2595.36 - 2599.62] they're spraying those crops with
[2597.76 - 2601.90] pollinator killers
[2599.62 - 2604.78] that means the bees get injured
[2601.90 - 2605.98] and other pollinators get injured
[2604.78 - 2608.14] so
[2605.98 - 2612.06] every time someone hits me with that
[2608.14 - 2615.28] hole why isn't this wild food organic
[2612.06 - 2616.60] and that's that's a problem why is it
[2615.28 - 2618.64] organic
[2616.60 - 2622.18] I said the other day don't give me that
[2618.64 - 2623.68] holier than whatever thing about that
[2622.18 - 2626.32] because you just don't know the
[2623.68 - 2629.38] information so it's important so let's
[2626.32 - 2631.06] step into it a little bit further
[2629.38 - 2634.66] so
[2631.06 - 2636.76] okay so wild blueberries
[2634.66 - 2638.92] or wild food
[2636.76 - 2643.32] tends to itself
[2638.92 - 2647.32] almost always that means
[2643.32 - 2649.84] bugs don't come and hurt the wild food
[2647.32 - 2651.58] because the wild food will hurt the bug
[2649.84 - 2654.70] keep that in mind
[2651.58 - 2657.58] if there ever is a situation where there
[2654.70 - 2660.64] is a bug affecting a certain part
[2657.58 - 2663.64] of a field somewhere then yeah Wyman's
[2660.64 - 2666.70] will use a spray but they won't use a
[2663.64 - 2667.96] pollinator killer and then they test
[2666.70 - 2670.00] their berries
[2667.96 - 2673.90] and they test them out and they find
[2670.00 - 2677.86] their zero percent pesticide residue but
[2673.90 - 2682.60] here's the thing organic farmers don't
[2677.86 - 2686.08] test their food for you as a consumer to
[2682.60 - 2687.82] make sure you don't have any nicotine in
[2686.08 - 2691.66] your organic produce
[2687.82 - 2694.06] MSG in your organic produce and copper
[2691.66 - 2698.14] they're not testing for that they're
[2694.06 - 2700.72] under the blanket term organic produce
[2698.14 - 2703.90] keep that in mind too
[2700.72 - 2705.76] and so and then some of the people which
[2703.90 - 2708.34] is really crazy some of the people that
[2705.76 - 2710.62] will actually complain and say well why
[2708.34 - 2712.84] does wild blueberry juice is not organic
[2710.62 - 2715.48] that same person
[2712.84 - 2717.64] eat at a restaurant two weeks ago and
[2715.48 - 2720.88] had conventional sprayed food
[2717.64 - 2724.12] that was sprayed though sprayed to
[2720.88 - 2726.10] not like a wild food that really rarely
[2724.12 - 2728.68] gets sprayed and they tested for zero
[2726.10 - 2730.36] percent pesticide right instead they're
[2728.68 - 2731.98] in a restaurant somewhere traveling
[2730.36 - 2734.32] they're sitting there on their high
[2731.98 - 2736.24] horse saying how oh oh why blueberries
[2734.32 - 2737.98] aren't organic and they're sitting there
[2736.24 - 2740.38] in some restaurant eating two or three
[2737.98 - 2742.66] items in their dish that was completely
[2740.38 - 2745.30] conventional and highly sprayed
[2742.66 - 2748.12] so keep that in mind too there's a big
[2745.30 - 2752.32] difference between organic and wild wild
[2748.12 - 2755.38] is a food above organic no matter what
[2752.32 - 2757.84] wild is above organic and that's the
[2755.38 - 2761.26] incredible part of it all
[2757.84 - 2764.68] but organic produce is sprayed three
[2761.26 - 2767.20] times a week with pollinator killers
[2764.68 - 2770.32] and that's not helping the bees
[2767.20 - 2772.00] lyman's doesn't hurt their bees
[2770.32 - 2774.16] keep that in mind
[2772.00 - 2776.92] and they spray only when they need to
[2774.16 - 2778.84] rarely depending and when they do they
[2776.92 - 2780.40] monitor it and they don't use a
[2778.84 - 2782.86] pollinator killer
[2780.40 - 2785.32] and that's absolutely incredible because
[2782.86 - 2788.14] it's a wild food and it takes care of
[2785.32 - 2791.14] itself so this is like a really
[2788.14 - 2793.90] important education on organic food when
[2791.14 - 2797.56] I go to the store right
[2793.90 - 2801.16] and I see some organic produce
[2797.56 - 2803.20] I buy the organic produce but I don't
[2801.16 - 2807.34] buy it ignorantly
[2803.20 - 2809.44] I don't buy it that way I buy it going
[2807.34 - 2812.50] that's probably got a load of copper and
[2809.44 - 2814.36] MSG on it that's probably got a load of
[2812.50 - 2816.34] nicotine on it
[2814.36 - 2818.44] and I'm gonna wash my organic produce
[2816.34 - 2821.98] when I bring it home because I know it's
[2818.44 - 2824.20] got nicotine residue MSG residue and
[2821.98 - 2825.94] copper residue I don't have to worry
[2824.20 - 2828.22] about that when I'm drinking my wild
[2825.94 - 2830.50] goober juice it's like freedom because
[2828.22 - 2832.90] it's wild food but when I go to the
[2830.50 - 2835.48] store that's what I well that's what I
[2832.90 - 2837.88] see I see food because I have I see
[2835.48 - 2839.62] everything right because that's that's
[2837.88 - 2843.46] just who I am
[2839.62 - 2845.86] and so I don't have blinders on I I'm
[2843.46 - 2849.16] not allowed to have blinders on I have
[2845.86 - 2852.10] to see everything for what it is
[2849.16 - 2853.96] Janessa says I love when aw shines truth
[2852.10 - 2855.52] through the brainwashing exactly
[2853.96 - 2858.52] brainwashing
[2855.52 - 2860.44] organic fields are so heavily Laden in
[2858.52 - 2864.16] nicotine and copper it is almost
[2860.44 - 2865.78] disturbing and disgusting but yet I
[2864.16 - 2867.52] still choose organic food because
[2865.78 - 2869.88] organic's better than
[2867.52 - 2874.06] standard conventional
[2869.88 - 2877.66] cultivated conventional produce organic
[2874.06 - 2879.82] is better than that produce while food
[2877.66 - 2883.36] is different it's above all of them
[2879.82 - 2887.56] while food is above conventional produce
[2883.36 - 2889.54] and above organic produce it's above
[2887.56 - 2891.76] both of them
[2889.54 - 2894.16] and that's how it works
[2891.76 - 2895.84] really important to know because I know
[2894.16 - 2898.96] that people get they get on their holy
[2895.84 - 2901.78] horse and they're just like let's slay
[2898.96 - 2903.94] aw let's take them down because he
[2901.78 - 2906.10] doesn't know like what and they just
[2903.94 - 2907.84] want to take me down it's like oh all
[2906.10 - 2909.94] you're doing is just like
[2907.84 - 2912.22] being like ridiculous because you don't
[2909.94 - 2914.26] know what's going on and that's how it
[2912.22 - 2917.80] works
[2914.26 - 2921.60] and I'm gonna have a
[2917.80 - 2921.60] nice little shot right here
[2922.80 - 2926.44] all right
[2925.00 - 2928.00] I'm gonna crack another bottle open
[2926.44 - 2930.22] while we're looking into stuff you guys
[2928.00 - 2931.60] I got I gotta start making a blueberry
[2930.22 - 2934.26] sausage a little bit but I want to make
[2931.60 - 2934.26] another waffle
[2936.54 - 2940.02] all right you guys
[2941.02 - 2945.28] all I have to do is take the time to
[2942.88 - 2946.66] fully explain it's hard to keep up with
[2945.28 - 2949.84] all the debunking
[2946.66 - 2952.72] I already worked 24 7.
[2949.84 - 2954.40] I'm already working 24 7 right trying to
[2952.72 - 2957.46] get out free information do everything I
[2954.40 - 2959.86] need to do and so it's hard to always
[2957.46 - 2963.16] try to teach and explain and debunk
[2959.86 - 2965.02] stuff misinformation it's so hard to
[2963.16 - 2967.78] constantly do that
[2965.02 - 2970.06] but what you'll notice is people get
[2967.78 - 2971.32] hurt along the way right they get hurt
[2970.06 - 2973.60] along the way
[2971.32 - 2974.32] because they'll get scared about Misty
[2973.60 - 2976.00] something they'll get some
[2974.32 - 2978.04] misinformation and then they lose a
[2976.00 - 2979.96] chance to even get what they need
[2978.04 - 2981.94] and I can't answer every you know
[2979.96 - 2984.90] everyone's
[2981.94 - 2984.90] you know attack
[2988.90 - 2992.20] I mean I can't tell you how many fake
[2990.58 - 2994.66] stories there are
[2992.20 - 2996.40] how much fake crap was made up about me
[2994.66 - 3000.12] out there
[2996.40 - 3002.82] and that's how Darkness works
[3000.12 - 3005.16] they're the ultimate just whatever
[3002.82 - 3007.86] and there's not enough time
[3005.16 - 3009.12] in my day or in my week to just battle
[3007.86 - 3012.54] all the
[3009.12 - 3013.32] silly stuff Ariel says calm down ew all
[3012.54 - 3015.06] right
[3013.32 - 3016.20] but calm down
[3015.06 - 3017.88] but yeah
[3016.20 - 3019.68] the thing is it's important to know
[3017.88 - 3021.66] because you know when I see that all the
[3019.68 - 3024.24] time like it's not organic it's like
[3021.66 - 3025.50] what anyway you guys I'm reading out of
[3024.24 - 3028.68] brain saver right here and I'm making
[3025.50 - 3031.32] actual waffles I'm excited
[3028.68 - 3034.94] Hoots here with me who's been awfully

[3056.34 - 3060.98] it's so filled with with just incredible
[3058.68 - 3060.98] information
[3061.08 - 3064.02] and I want to read a little bit more in
