[2.16 - 6.24] everybody gets sick hospitals are filled
[4.56 - 8.16] with sick people do you think you're
[6.24 - 9.12] going to go through an entire life not
[8.16 - 12.20] getting
[9.12 - 13.40] sick no one's done it no one's done it
[12.20 - 15.80] before out there do you think you're
[13.40 - 18.64] going to go through an entire life and
[15.80 - 20.44] not get sick I love this even people who
[18.64 - 21.88] have survived right they've survived
[20.44 - 23.40] through surgeries and different
[21.88 - 25.44] sicknesses and all that and they get to
[23.40 - 27.88] their 80s and they've survived with
[25.44 - 29.64] gallbladders being removed and all kind
[27.88 - 31.44] you know pieces of their lungs removed
[29.64 - 33.16] right and all of that and they actually
[31.44 - 36.48] get through to the point where they're
[33.16 - 38.04] in their 80s and they made it that far
[36.48 - 40.20] and they're in the late ' 80s and all of
[38.04 - 42.80] a sudden they die and that happens it's
[40.20 - 45.60] horrible they die and then they say well
[42.80 - 47.16] they died of natural causes because
[45.60 - 49.24] they're older so they say it's natural
[47.16 - 51.96] causes meanwhile it's pathogens they
[49.24 - 54.44] just got to them later somehow it's
[51.96 - 56.68] viruses it's bacteria that got to them
[54.44 - 58.48] later somehow it's toxic heavy metals
[56.68 - 61.12] it's all the junk that's in everybody's
[58.48 - 64.80] systems it got to them later right
[61.12 - 66.80] pathogens if you ever walk by any place
[64.80 - 70.12] like if you're walking down a street and
[66.80 - 71.96] if there's a medical center or or a do
[70.12 - 73.52] or a doctor's office or if you ever
[71.96 - 75.20] drive by a doctor's office if you ever
[73.52 - 79.44] drive by a
[75.20 - 80.96] hospital what is going on is broken
[79.44 - 82.48] immune system broken immune system
[80.96 - 84.04] broken immune system every time I drive
[82.48 - 85.60] by a hospital I'm like broken immune
[84.04 - 86.60] system every single person in there
[85.60 - 88.60] they're in there because they have a
[86.60 - 90.16] broken immune system they got a busted
[88.60 - 91.92] up immune system it's not function
[90.16 - 93.80] properly you drive by a doctor's office
[91.92 - 95.76] broken immune system you drive by a skin
[93.80 - 96.96] doctor's office right broken immune
[95.76 - 99.48] system you got a whole bunch of people
[96.96 - 101.56] waiting in in the waiting room at a
[99.48 - 103.60] dermatologist office or a skin skin
[101.56 - 105.04] surgeon's office broken immune system
[103.60 - 107.00] broken immune system whole bunch of
[105.04 - 108.80] people getting different tests in a
[107.00 - 111.52] facility a medical facility broken
[108.80 - 113.20] immune system that's how it works and
[111.52 - 115.20] yeah another thing too back to what I
[113.20 - 117.20] was saying in older people they die of
[115.20 - 119.88] pneumonia they die they get sick easy
[117.20 - 122.24] they still get sick easy too everybody
[119.88 - 123.68] young people old people they get sick
[122.24 - 125.20] they get sick at some point in their
[123.68 - 126.56] life and why it's because their immune
[125.20 - 129.00] system isn't working good it's because
[126.56 - 130.72] the pathogens that we're up against
[129.00 - 132.96] that's what it is it's a big part now I
[130.72 - 135.12] know that many of you be like well it's
[132.96 - 136.80] stress you're not getting enough rest
[135.12 - 139.20] you're not getting enough sleep you're
[136.80 - 140.84] too stressed out sure all triggers
[139.20 - 143.44] definitely you don't sleep that's a
[140.84 - 145.44] trigger you don't get enough rest that's
[143.44 - 148.20] a trigger you don't get enough you know
[145.44 - 150.28] stressfree moments that's right a
[148.20 - 153.44] trigger all those things are triggers
[150.28 - 156.84] but triggers for the pathogens to rise
[153.44 - 158.20] up and rise up and grow and expand and
[156.84 - 160.24] and explode and everything I'm going to
[158.20 - 161.60] show you guys a little bit about what it
[160.24 - 163.64] looks like to have a broken immune
[161.60 - 165.52] system and I'm going to talk to you guys
[163.64 - 167.44] about a healthy immune system as well
[165.52 - 168.88] what that looks like is is well we're
[167.44 - 172.32] going to cover a lot of cool stuff
[168.88 - 174.68] that's what we're here for today and so
[172.32 - 176.80] anytime you see anybody struggling
[174.68 - 179.52] whatever it is on the internet right on
[176.80 - 181.44] social you know I got skin problems I
[179.52 - 183.44] got this I got that it's because their
[181.44 - 186.08] immune system is challenged it's all
[183.44 - 187.96] immune system completely underestimated
[186.08 - 189.68] completely underrated out there the
[187.96 - 192.32] media doesn't talk about the immune
[189.68 - 193.96] system it's really rare nowhere do you
[192.32 - 196.92] really see the immune system talked
[193.96 - 199.48] about enough meanwhile the reason why
[196.92 - 202.60] you are sick is because your immune
[199.48 - 209.28] system is not handling what it's up
[202.60 - 211.44] against the reason why everybody is sick
[209.28 - 213.52] is because your immune system is
[211.44 - 216.36] struggling it's weakened it's not
[213.52 - 219.20] functioning the way it needs to function
[216.36 - 220.92] that is just a fact Jack that's the
[219.20 - 223.80] bottom line right there people don't
[220.92 - 226.92] realize out there that everything UTI
[223.80 - 230.32] headaches this that you name it right
[226.92 - 232.64] conjunctivitis body pain ACH a achy body
[230.32 - 234.44] fatigue okay all these different things
[232.64 - 235.48] people are dealing with every single day
[234.44 - 238.20] bladder
[235.48 - 240.88] infections everything from PID
[238.20 - 244.52] everything from cysts and tumors and all
[240.88 - 245.96] that immune system you name it warts
[244.52 - 247.28] immune system there's people out there
[245.96 - 249.48] they got warts on their hands they got
[247.28 - 251.56] warts on their elbows they got warts on
[249.48 - 253.04] their feet on the bottom of their feet
[251.56 - 256.36] they got warts in all kinds of different
[253.04 - 258.32] places immune system you catch colds you
[256.36 - 260.08] catch flu you catch all that all that
[258.32 - 263.44] just immune system you can talk about it
[260.08 - 265.08] all day everything people are suffering
[263.44 - 266.44] with one way or another it's because
[265.08 - 269.32] their immune system is broken down you
[266.44 - 270.72] know somebody with cancer immune system
[269.32 - 272.24] you know somebody is struggling with any
[270.72 - 273.44] kind of cancer diagnosis any kind of
[272.24 - 276.08] cancer problem and they're struggling
[273.44 - 279.60] with that immune system it's just it's
[276.08 - 283.80] everything Lyme disease ra fibro thyroid
[279.60 - 286.28] problems on any level immune system
[283.80 - 288.48] something's wrong something is
[286.28 - 292.04] struggling within your immune system
[288.48 - 295.08] it's weakened anything like that does a
[292.04 - 297.52] matter what it is skin problems all of
[295.08 - 299.08] it immune system so we're talking about
[297.52 - 302.48] the immune system I'm going to do a
[299.08 - 306.12] little art today I am an
[302.48 - 308.84] artist I went to Art School no I didn't
[306.12 - 310.76] but I have a board here and I'm going to
[308.84 - 313.52] do a little bit of drawing too I want to
[310.76 - 314.72] show you guys some immune system stuff
[313.52 - 315.80] and everything like that but what's
[314.72 - 318.76] really supposed to happen you're
[315.80 - 318.76] supposed to have a strong immune
[321.80 - 327.28] system immune cell immun
[325.00 - 330.40] self eat it all
[327.28 - 334.56] up and there you go you got a nice
[330.40 - 334.56] healthy immune cell ready for another
[337.44 - 343.64] one no no immune cell immune
[341.04 - 346.00] cell gobbling it all up and then you got
[343.64 - 348.00] a healthy immune cell right there and
[346.00 - 350.48] that's what it's supposed to do but it
[348.00 - 352.04] doesn't always work like that instead
[350.48 - 353.72] this is what it's like for a lot of
[352.04 - 355.64] people right here here's what it is you
[353.72 - 361.48] ready here it
[355.64 - 361.48] is I've SE bar flu
[362.60 - 367.68] RSV whatever
[364.68 - 367.68] STP
[370.60 - 376.24] here immune cell dead gone and then the
[374.68 - 378.32] virus is still there the pathogen's
[376.24 - 379.24] still there right and then all of a
[378.32 - 382.28] sudden
[379.24 - 385.68] again another one immune cell immune
[382.28 - 387.76] cell coming to rescue immune cell dies
[385.68 - 390.20] pathogen is still there what the heck is
[387.76 - 393.00] going on that's how it work works over
[390.20 - 395.60] and over again the pathogens stay your
[393.00 - 397.64] immune cells die that's why people are
[395.60 - 399.36] sick they're filling in the hospitals
[397.64 - 403.00] fill in the doctor's office is because
[399.36 - 404.88] their immune cells have died sure they
[403.00 - 406.28] got some new immune cells being produced
[404.88 - 407.08] they're coming out but they're weaken
[406.28 - 410.56] they're
[407.08 - 413.16] broken and they die fast and they die
[410.56 - 415.12] easy that's how it works you got a cold
[413.16 - 417.92] sore you got a fever blister and it's
[415.12 - 420.56] sitting there a little too long your
[417.92 - 422.40] immune cells are dying trying to fight
[420.56 - 424.88] that so you got the fever
[422.40 - 426.96] blister right it's sitting there you got
[424.88 - 428.96] that fever blister your immune cell
[426.96 - 431.00] comes out to get die you just lost
[428.96 - 432.84] another one and now there it is still
[431.00 - 434.40] you got the Simplex it's still sitting
[432.84 - 436.00] there and then you got another immune
[434.40 - 438.24] cell coming here coming in there to get
[436.00 - 440.04] it boom your immune cell dies what the
[438.24 - 442.92] heck is going on your immune cell can't
[440.04 - 445.12] kill it it can't kill it still there for
[442.92 - 448.92] another couple days another immune cell
[445.12 - 451.08] coming out boom dies that's how it works
[448.92 - 453.48] but people don't talk about that they
[451.08 - 454.84] don't know they don't talk about it I
[453.48 - 456.76] don't see anybody talking about it in
[454.84 - 460.84] the health realm at all about how many
[456.76 - 463.88] immune cells die and drop dead so fast
[460.84 - 465.88] and get annihilated by the pathogens by
[463.88 - 468.96] the viruses and by the
[465.88 - 470.44] bacteria that's doing it to them and
[468.96 - 472.80] people don't talk about it they don't
[470.44 - 474.96] know you're in the doctor's office you
[472.80 - 476.68] got fatigue you got fibromyalgia you got
[474.96 - 478.84] depression whatever it is you're sick
[476.68 - 481.36] you don't feel good immune cells are
[478.84 - 483.44] constantly dying they're trying to fight
[481.36 - 485.40] the bad boys your immune cells are
[483.44 - 487.60] trying to fight the bad boys and they're
[485.40 - 490.12] getting eaten alive and then the
[487.60 - 492.48] pathogen stays there and the immune cell
[490.12 - 494.12] is gone and then here it goes again you
[492.48 - 496.12] got more pathogens now now they're
[494.12 - 497.96] doubling now they're tripling then you
[496.12 - 500.16] got more pathogens now you're just sick
[497.96 - 503.00] for months you got all kinds of things
[500.16 - 505.00] going on you're catching a cold a flu on
[503.00 - 506.68] top of the fact that you got up SE bar
[505.00 - 508.52] and then your immune cells come in here
[506.68 - 510.08] and they get eaten alive again and guess
[508.52 - 512.08] what stays there you lose lose your
[510.08 - 514.20] immune cell and then that's what stays
[512.08 - 517.92] there all of this and then we're up
[514.20 - 519.80] against immune system Busters we're up
[517.92 - 521.32] against the fragrances the toxic heavy
[519.80 - 522.64] metals the toxic waste that we're
[521.32 - 524.68] dealing with every day the pesticides
[522.64 - 527.00] the herbicides everything we deal with
[524.68 - 529.32] all day long the air fresheners and all
[527.00 - 531.56] the other stuff and the detergents the
[529.32 - 533.32] fabric softeners and all that stuff and
[531.56 - 535.72] it's just weakening their immune system
[533.32 - 538.16] even more every single day cologne
[535.72 - 539.44] weakens the immune system it does so
[538.16 - 543.32] your immune cells they can't can't
[539.44 - 544.96] battle all of this so okay someone hey
[543.32 - 547.24] look you know I've been sick on and off
[544.96 - 550.08] for 5 years do you know how many immune
[547.24 - 552.80] cells died in five years I've been sick
[550.08 - 554.68] for like three years now I got fatigue I
[552.80 - 556.88] got this i got this neurological symptom
[554.68 - 559.08] I don't feel good I got all kinds of
[556.88 - 560.88] issues I've been diagnosed with Ms or
[559.08 - 562.52] diagnosed with fibro and diagnosed with
[560.88 - 564.88] chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed with
[562.52 - 566.40] Lyme disease whatever it is all kinds of
[564.88 - 568.60] things that I have do you know how many
[566.40 - 569.84] immune cells died trying to fight those
[568.60 - 572.72] pathogens
[569.84 - 575.68] how many of them disappeared and got
[572.72 - 577.76] annihilated boom gone pathogens just
[575.68 - 580.56] took over still sick you got a liver
[577.76 - 583.56] full of pathogens you got a spleen full
[580.56 - 585.56] of pathogens you got like a thyroid full
[583.56 - 587.04] of pathogens that's what people have
[585.56 - 588.52] they got thyroid problems forever
[587.04 - 589.92] they're taking thyroid medications they
[588.52 - 591.80] got the hypothyroidism they got the
[589.92 - 593.84] hyperthyroidism they're strugg like the
[591.80 - 596.44] graves you name it they got the Epstein
[593.84 - 598.20] bar sitting inside their thyroid and
[596.44 - 599.72] guess what you got your immune cells
[598.20 - 601.56] going there all the time and they're
[599.72 - 603.80] trying to fight it and they're dying
[601.56 - 605.84] they're going bye-bye but guess what the
[603.80 - 607.64] bugs still stay there in the thyroid the
[605.84 - 609.56] bugs still stay there in the liver the
[607.64 - 611.48] bugs still stay there wherever and
[609.56 - 613.08] that's how it
[611.48 - 616.60] works
[613.08 - 620.36] sobering really really really
[616.60 - 623.08] sobering is what it is I mean very
[620.36 - 627.36] important does the immune system get
[623.08 - 629.60] smarter if we're eating better well our
[627.36 - 631.72] immune system doesn't get smarter if
[629.60 - 633.44] we're eating this kind of stuff right
[631.72 - 635.32] here I'm just going to have a piece of
[633.44 - 637.08] cheese that'll fix my immune system let
[635.32 - 640.20] me go and have lots of cheese there's a
[637.08 - 642.32] here's a a whole a slice of Bree nice
[640.20 - 645.64] aged Brie right there and we got the
[642.32 - 647.60] pecarina Romano we got parmesan Rano and
[645.64 - 649.16] we got all the nice cheeses so great to
[647.60 - 650.56] put on our dishes our immune system
[649.16 - 652.60] doesn't get smarter when we're dealing
[650.56 - 654.32] with things like this this feeds the
[652.60 - 656.08] bugs even more I've been talking about
[654.32 - 658.16] that for years when we give our immune
[656.08 - 660.36] cells though phytochemicals that they
[658.16 - 662.16] need they get stronger when we feed our
[660.36 - 664.80] immune cells what they need they get
[662.16 - 667.24] stronger this does not get your immune
[664.80 - 670.40] system stronger this right here doesn't
[667.24 - 673.60] I no people love their eggs the amount
[670.40 - 675.76] of crap I get because of eggs the amount
[673.60 - 677.80] of crap there's that's one of the
[675.76 - 680.32] reasons why there's so many haters
[677.80 - 681.92] there's so many haters there's so many
[680.32 - 684.32] of them for medical medium haters
[681.92 - 686.20] because they've been so upset about
[684.32 - 688.80] things like eggs when I talk bad about
[686.20 - 691.24] them or say hey they feed bugs and they
[688.80 - 693.76] feed pathogens people get upset and then
[691.24 - 696.24] you then you just birth another hater
[693.76 - 698.64] born another hater another hater born
[696.24 - 700.28] another hater born but people don't
[698.64 - 702.12] realize though this is information to
[700.28 - 704.36] help them if your immune system is
[702.12 - 706.32] weakened and you're on eggs it'll stay
[704.36 - 708.00] weakened because the pathogens will keep
[706.32 - 709.80] on feeding off the eggs I talked about
[708.00 - 711.00] this this is not an egg show but I'm
[709.80 - 713.28] just giving you guys a little quick
[711.00 - 715.28] rundown on a couple of different
[713.28 - 717.56] things guys I want to tell you something
[715.28 - 720.52] about a product before I forget okay I
[717.56 - 722.52] don't know if you've seen this
[720.52 - 724.56] revolutionary have you seen this you
[722.52 - 726.40] probably can't see it right here it's
[724.56 - 728.80] called total immune it's by
[726.40 - 730.80] VY okay
[728.80 - 732.84] revolutionary I'm Downing it right now
[730.80 - 734.44] during this flu season right here I got
[732.84 - 736.48] my family on this right here I got my
[734.44 - 740.12] friends on this right here right now
[736.48 - 743.80] this is the Mullen and the time of the
[740.12 - 746.80] highest quality potency unbelievable
[743.80 - 748.60] this is the Mullen in time and what's
[746.80 - 750.20] I'm noticing is the media is not talking
[748.60 - 752.00] about how bad it is out there the media
[750.20 - 753.68] is not talking about the white lung
[752.00 - 755.52] anymore the media is not talking about
[753.68 - 757.44] everybody coughing their guts out
[755.52 - 759.40] everybody's sick right now and they're
[757.44 - 762.64] sick with the flu they're sick with the
[759.40 - 765.60] whatever RSV they're sick with the c and
[762.64 - 767.56] then you got this new virus that's
[765.60 - 769.96] blowing through right now they're
[767.56 - 772.28] getting sick and that's what's happening
[769.96 - 775.76] and I just called that shot back a month
[772.28 - 778.44] ago and I call that shot two months ago
[775.76 - 780.32] and I told you guys people are going to
[778.44 - 785.48] be CAU coughing their guts out and sick
[780.32 - 786.96] and totally into that long that long flu
[785.48 - 788.56] that everybody has right now they're
[786.96 - 790.60] getting that long flu they're getting
[788.56 - 792.00] whacked down beaten down and it's hard
[790.60 - 793.72] to come out of it and that's happening
[792.00 - 795.52] to everybody right now I wanted to show
[793.72 - 797.76] you this product right here I'll show it
[795.52 - 800.36] to you in a little bit okay this is the
[797.76 - 802.36] Mullen it has a little touch of zinc in
[800.36 - 804.80] there just a little touch so what I'm
[802.36 - 806.72] doing is I'm still taking my zinc and
[804.80 - 809.60] taking this at the same time but it's
[806.72 - 811.92] the Mullen and the th this is a
[809.60 - 814.56] combination that's incredible
[811.92 - 816.36] respiratory you name it immune system
[814.56 - 817.64] you name it this is it right here I just
[816.36 - 819.00] wanted to show you guys and I'm going to
[817.64 - 821.80] show you a little bit more later but we
[819.00 - 821.80] got a lot of work to
[822.24 - 828.04] do and you guys know I work with them I
[825.76 - 829.80] support those guys because the stuff is
[828.04 - 831.60] incredible talked about that over and
[829.80 - 832.64] over again so let's go into it a little
[831.60 - 838.28] bit
[832.64 - 840.08] okay all right just lost my cap so an
[838.28 - 844.48] immune
[840.08 - 848.32] cell okay there's an immune cell right
[844.48 - 850.40] here okay it's supposed to be strong
[848.32 - 853.08] it's supposed to be vibrant it's
[850.40 - 855.32] supposed to have what I call Sun
[853.08 - 858.16] qualities it doesn't mean getting
[855.32 - 859.92] Sun keeps it strong getting sun is
[858.16 - 861.68] healthy setting getting some sun is good
[859.92 - 863.88] for you yes it's it's supportive for the
[861.68 - 867.08] immune system definitely but what I like
[863.88 - 869.48] to say is immune cells I like to call
[867.08 - 872.48] having Sun quality
[869.48 - 875.16] Sun qualities to them what I mean is a
[872.48 - 879.36] brightness the immune cell is alive the
[875.16 - 881.96] immune cell is vital it's strong that's
[879.36 - 884.60] how we need to envision our CS that's
[881.96 - 888.88] the cells we want that's the cells we
[884.60 - 891.12] want to feed and keep strong and keep
[888.88 - 894.08] stronger and stronger we want our immune
[891.12 - 896.32] cells like this right here and imagine
[894.08 - 898.48] your immune cells having blue around
[896.32 - 901.36] them imagine your immune cells having
[898.48 - 905.36] White white light around them and blue
[901.36 - 908.68] light around them okay so what immune
[905.36 - 911.56] cell is supposed to admit is energy your
[908.68 - 915.88] immune cell is supposed to Emmit
[911.56 - 919.24] strength and energy okay that energy is
[915.88 - 922.64] what weakens the virus or the pathogen
[919.24 - 924.12] on point keep this in mind all right so
[922.64 - 926.32] here you go you
[924.12 - 927.60] got all right I'm going to move this
[926.32 - 930.44] over a little
[927.60 - 933.28] bit there we
[930.44 - 937.36] go your immune cell is supposed to be
[933.28 - 939.60] emitting strength and energy okay that's
[937.36 - 941.28] what it's supposed to why not just
[939.60 - 942.32] because of its vibrancy not just because
[941.28 - 946.16] of its
[942.32 - 949.32] Vitality that's not just it because the
[946.16 - 952.00] energy it adits weakens a pathogen when
[949.32 - 955.16] the pathogen is in a certain radius of
[952.00 - 959.24] the immune cell a certain
[955.16 - 963.36] radius keep that in mind you got a a
[959.24 - 966.28] pathogen coming closer to you got a
[963.36 - 966.28] pathogen coming
[967.00 - 974.24] closer missing all my little
[970.52 - 977.72] markers so if you got a pathogen
[974.24 - 977.72] okay and that
[983.56 - 990.00] pathogen that pathogen is coming near
[986.52 - 991.80] the immune cell what's radiating off of
[990.00 - 995.36] your immune cell is supposed to be so
[991.80 - 997.52] strong so vital the energy coming off
[995.36 - 1000.92] stuns the pathogen that's what it's
[997.52 - 1004.36] supposed to do actually stun it to
[1000.92 - 1008.08] weaken it it's kind of like a spell it
[1004.36 - 1010.16] puts on the pathogen that's the key we
[1008.08 - 1013.48] want our immune cells
[1010.16 - 1016.40] strong so that they weaken the pathogen
[1013.48 - 1018.24] when the pathogen gets close so as the
[1016.40 - 1020.52] pathogen gets closer to the immune
[1018.24 - 1022.72] system cell or the immune cell gets
[1020.52 - 1025.76] closer to the pathogen the virus the
[1022.72 - 1028.88] bacteria and so forth okay this
[1025.76 - 1031.36] radiating energy you see coming off of a
[1028.88 - 1034.84] strong healthy immune
[1031.36 - 1037.56] cell puts the pathogen in a weak in
[1034.84 - 1040.24] state like a trance so you see what I'm
[1037.56 - 1044.28] doing right here when your immune cell
[1040.24 - 1047.92] gets closer and closer to that pathogen
[1044.28 - 1049.64] it sends out more energy frequency more
[1047.92 - 1052.96] vibration
[1049.64 - 1057.16] more Vitality emits from your immune
[1052.96 - 1059.16] cell as that happens it starts to hit
[1057.16 - 1061.36] the pathogen as you see right here on
[1059.16 - 1064.84] the board see the
[1061.36 - 1067.76] pathogen whether the pathogen is flu
[1064.84 - 1070.16] whether the path EBV whether the
[1067.76 - 1072.12] pathogen is something else is
[1070.16 - 1075.48] strep
[1072.12 - 1079.96] okay regardless of what it
[1075.48 - 1082.80] is that energy emitting from a healthy
[1079.96 - 1085.16] vital immune cell an immune cell that
[1082.80 - 1087.88] was fed an immune cell that was
[1085.16 - 1090.36] supported you guys this is a big deal
[1087.88 - 1093.68] not an immune system not an immune cell
[1090.36 - 1096.68] that was starved not an immune cell that
[1093.68 - 1099.80] was broken down when you got a strong
[1096.68 - 1104.48] one here's how it's supposed to work
[1099.80 - 1108.40] it's supposed to disable the pathogen
[1104.48 - 1110.96] and prepare it to get eaten it's a
[1108.40 - 1113.08] supposed to actually weaken it so if
[1110.96 - 1115.44] there's more pathogens as well say
[1113.08 - 1117.88] there's another pathogen here okay
[1115.44 - 1120.16] because they explode and they piperade
[1117.88 - 1122.84] and they they grow and there's another
[1120.16 - 1126.32] pathogen here right here
[1122.84 - 1128.24] okay you can have two pathogens three
[1126.32 - 1129.96] people get the flu then they get what
[1128.24 - 1131.96] happens is you get the flu your immune
[1129.96 - 1134.52] system weakens and your immune system
[1131.96 - 1138.00] weakens from the flu and then all of a
[1134.52 - 1141.44] sudden an Epstein bar shows up Epstein
[1138.00 - 1145.64] bar are growing as well okay a strong
[1141.44 - 1149.16] immune cell radiates a frequency and an
[1145.64 - 1151.28] energy has strong vitality and what this
[1149.16 - 1156.16] is right here what this barrier is
[1151.28 - 1157.92] you're seeing okay this barrier is
[1156.16 - 1162.00] it's a
[1157.92 - 1164.48] tranquilizer for the pathogen makes it
[1162.00 - 1166.60] docile makes it
[1164.48 - 1169.60] sleepy makes it
[1166.60 - 1171.96] weakened puts it in a trance puts it in
[1169.60 - 1176.52] a spell that's your strong immune cell
[1171.96 - 1178.12] right there okay as the pathogens weaken
[1176.52 - 1182.04] and then they get placed in that
[1178.12 - 1185.00] energetic spell you see right here the
[1182.04 - 1188.32] immune cell can determine what pathogen
[1185.00 - 1192.36] it's going to tackle first which one
[1188.32 - 1194.56] it's going to hit right away okay and it
[1192.36 - 1197.72] makes a decision because your immune
[1194.56 - 1199.52] cells are smart they make a decision
[1197.72 - 1201.92] there's your IM cell right there on
[1199.52 - 1205.68] which one they're going to attack and
[1201.92 - 1207.48] Tackle first to gobble up so this energy
[1205.68 - 1209.64] that's admitting that science doesn't
[1207.48 - 1212.20] know about that science is unaware of
[1209.64 - 1214.52] they don't have their finger on this but
[1212.20 - 1217.88] that energy that's admitting putting
[1214.52 - 1221.80] those pathogens in a trance
[1217.88 - 1223.96] okay allows the immune cell to determine
[1221.80 - 1226.24] which pathogen which virus what
[1223.96 - 1228.44] bacterium it's going to attack first and
[1226.24 - 1230.16] Gobble up first because the goal is your
[1228.44 - 1233.28] immune cell is trying to stay alive your
[1230.16 - 1235.44] immune cell is trying to be strong and
[1233.28 - 1238.28] Outlast the
[1235.44 - 1242.20] bugs your immune cell does not want to
[1238.28 - 1244.96] die our immune cells do not get
[1242.20 - 1246.64] created in our bones in our body and
[1244.96 - 1249.80] they do not get created because they
[1246.64 - 1251.84] want to die fast they want to live long
[1249.80 - 1253.56] they want to prosper they want to have
[1251.84 - 1255.64] strength and they want to do their job
[1253.56 - 1258.24] and eat up all the bad
[1255.64 - 1261.00] stuff so you got your immune cell right
[1258.24 - 1263.08] here that's vital it's got vitality and
[1261.00 - 1266.28] strength it's admitting that frequency
[1263.08 - 1269.28] it's weakening the Invaders the
[1266.28 - 1272.60] pathogens it's making them docile it's
[1269.28 - 1275.36] making them sleepy it's making them weak
[1272.60 - 1278.72] and then the immune cell makes its break
[1275.36 - 1282.44] it determines from admitting that energy
[1278.72 - 1285.52] which Invader it's going to attack first
[1282.44 - 1289.04] most of the time our immune cells attack
[1285.52 - 1292.88] the strongest one the one that's acting
[1289.04 - 1296.44] out the virus that's acting like a
[1292.88 - 1300.04] problem it's not as docile it's not
[1296.44 - 1303.80] getting put into a trans easy it's
[1300.04 - 1306.76] radical it's a radical one
[1303.80 - 1308.96] okay and that radical one is the one
[1306.76 - 1311.20] that your immune cell goes after that's
[1308.96 - 1312.40] what it does right here it goes after
[1311.20 - 1315.16] the radical
[1312.40 - 1319.80] one and it leaves the other ones in the
[1315.16 - 1321.72] trance sleepy and Spellbound IND doile
[1319.80 - 1325.44] and as your immune cell goes It goes to
[1321.72 - 1328.48] the radical one and goes into war a
[1325.44 - 1331.28] battle that's what it does and in that
[1328.48 - 1333.16] battle your immune cell wants to win it
[1331.28 - 1335.64] doesn't want to die and a strong immune
[1333.16 - 1338.16] system stays strong and it wins and it
[1335.64 - 1340.60] kills that pathogen right there and it
[1338.16 - 1345.44] destroys it and once it destroys it it's
[1340.60 - 1346.96] gone right and then it moves on for
[1345.44 - 1350.32] another
[1346.96 - 1353.48] okay see piley says where does the
[1350.32 - 1355.60] immune cell get its incredible
[1353.48 - 1357.52] energy we'll talk about that in a little
[1355.60 - 1360.80] bit that's a great question and I want
[1357.52 - 1363.32] to answer it so what happens now is you
[1360.80 - 1365.00] got these other viruses and pathogens
[1363.32 - 1367.60] and they're in that sleepy State the
[1365.00 - 1369.56] doile state and that's where the immune
[1367.60 - 1373.20] cell gains a little bit of strength
[1369.56 - 1375.52] again lightens up brightens up gets
[1373.20 - 1377.80] strong and then it starts attacking each
[1375.52 - 1381.48] one that it knows it actually made spell
[1377.80 - 1384.80] back bound it attacks each one one at a
[1381.48 - 1387.40] time that it knows it made Spell bound
[1384.80 - 1387.40] that's how it
[1389.56 - 1394.56] works
[1391.36 - 1396.04] okay but it's not always like this okay
[1394.56 - 1397.68] here's what it's like out there you
[1396.04 - 1401.12] drive by the hospitals you drive by the
[1397.68 - 1404.60] doctor's offices I don't care if you're
[1401.12 - 1407.00] 10 years old 20 years old 30 years old
[1404.60 - 1410.28] the the doctor's offices are filled with
[1407.00 - 1413.48] them a lot lots of people young people
[1410.28 - 1415.28] older people filled with lots and lots
[1413.48 - 1417.04] of people they're all struggling with
[1415.28 - 1419.68] their immune system because everybody
[1417.04 - 1422.12] has immune system problems now here is
[1419.68 - 1423.36] an immune cell right here that's your
[1422.12 - 1428.80] immune
[1423.36 - 1430.52] cell okay this immune cell is a little
[1428.80 - 1434.48] weaker
[1430.52 - 1436.68] fragmented it's got pits in it pits and
[1434.48 - 1438.64] divots in it
[1436.68 - 1441.44] okay that's that's what people's immune
[1438.64 - 1442.64] cells look like these days right there
[1441.44 - 1447.08] they look like
[1442.64 - 1449.92] this a worn out tattered immune cell
[1447.08 - 1452.32] that didn't even go through a lot yet
[1449.92 - 1455.52] even if it's fresh off the press inside
[1452.32 - 1456.96] your body that's the immune cell that
[1455.52 - 1459.56] most people are walking around with
[1456.96 - 1462.68] every single day it's the weakened
[1459.56 - 1466.80] tattered beaten
[1462.68 - 1470.68] down immune cell it's got divots and
[1466.80 - 1472.88] marks in it and pits and
[1470.68 - 1476.36] indentations and
[1472.88 - 1479.28] inconsistencies and the cell membrane is
[1476.36 - 1482.12] weak okay now when it admits strength
[1479.28 - 1484.60] and admits Vitality it doesn't admit
[1482.12 - 1488.28] what I was showing you before instead
[1484.60 - 1490.72] it's kind of feeble it's kind of
[1488.28 - 1494.12] broken parts of the cell don't even
[1490.72 - 1495.84] admit anything only certain parts of the
[1494.12 - 1498.36] cell will admit a little bit of strength
[1495.84 - 1499.92] and a little bit of frequency okay
[1498.36 - 1501.40] and so what happens is though there's
[1499.92 - 1502.72] other parts of that cell this is what
[1501.40 - 1504.20] people are walking around with every
[1502.72 - 1505.36] single day every single day out there
[1504.20 - 1507.44] they're struggling with all kinds of
[1505.36 - 1510.04] immune system and health issues that's
[1507.44 - 1511.92] what they're dealing with their immune
[1510.04 - 1514.92] cells are tattered broken down don't
[1511.92 - 1518.04] look good beaten down they got
[1514.92 - 1521.52] indentations inconsistencies all of it
[1518.04 - 1523.48] and so even parts of the cell Shadow so
[1521.52 - 1527.16] it people don't realize as parts of that
[1523.48 - 1529.64] immune system immune cell Will Shadow it
[1527.16 - 1532.72] won't have have the pop it won't have
[1529.64 - 1535.48] that strength coming off of it it's
[1532.72 - 1539.20] fragmented it's weakened and then what
[1535.48 - 1541.16] happens is you got the pathogens next
[1539.20 - 1543.44] pathogens come around you're getting the
[1541.16 - 1545.12] flu you're getting the RSV whatever it
[1543.44 - 1547.64] is you got the EBV and you got the
[1545.12 - 1553.12] pathogens going on here
[1547.64 - 1553.12] right put a little fur on the
[1554.40 - 1560.60] pathogens some bacterium some viruses
[1558.52 - 1562.60] don't judge me on my
[1560.60 - 1566.68] artistic
[1562.60 - 1569.56] talents okay the radiate sorry the
[1566.68 - 1572.16] energy that's admitting the
[1569.56 - 1576.08] vibrations that energy field that your
[1572.16 - 1579.32] immune cell is supposed to have is
[1576.08 - 1582.08] weakened it doesn't put these into a
[1579.32 - 1585.64] sleep mode there's not enough strength
[1582.08 - 1589.08] coming off the cell and so what happens
[1585.64 - 1591.64] instead is these invad ERS pick up and
[1589.08 - 1595.56] they know you have a weaked immune cell
[1591.64 - 1598.32] they know it they can smell it a mile
[1595.56 - 1604.40] away all the different bugs
[1598.32 - 1609.84] hhv6 cyega virus hsv1 hsv2
[1604.40 - 1613.44] hhv7 EBV right wrong there
[1609.84 - 1613.44] EBV okay
[1615.64 - 1621.64] HPV and these invad haers know that the
[1619.60 - 1624.16] cells are
[1621.64 - 1626.76] broken so much so they don't even have
[1624.16 - 1628.40] to be stealth anymore and when those
[1626.76 - 1631.04] Invaders don't have to be stealth
[1628.40 - 1633.08] anymore they rule the roost and you get
[1631.04 - 1635.28] the Lyme disease diagnosis and then the
[1633.08 - 1636.84] fibro diagnoses and then the ra and then
[1635.28 - 1638.88] the sertic arthritis and then the
[1636.84 - 1640.40] autoimmune diagnosis and then you get
[1638.88 - 1642.12] the neurological symptoms and then you
[1640.40 - 1644.80] get all the other different stuff with
[1642.12 - 1647.24] it and then we live with a host of
[1644.80 - 1649.64] different symptoms neurological all
[1647.24 - 1651.48] kinds of of other symptoms too because
[1649.64 - 1654.80] What's Happening Here is our immune
[1651.48 - 1658.08] cells look like that right there
[1654.80 - 1659.32] fragmented broken and weakened we can do
[1658.08 - 1661.80] something about it this is about
[1659.32 - 1663.36] empowering you and doing things for your
[1661.80 - 1667.04] immune cells and that's what medical
[1663.36 - 1669.44] meum information is all about it's all
[1667.04 - 1671.76] about restoring that immune system and
[1669.44 - 1673.88] restoring that immune cell and making it
[1671.76 - 1676.88] strong and making it vital and
[1673.88 - 1680.48] vibrant a weakened immune cell has a
[1676.88 - 1682.80] problem once it admits its energy it's
[1680.48 - 1686.96] already weakening itself it's not
[1682.80 - 1689.84] staying strong and then it decides what
[1686.96 - 1693.48] pathogen it wants to go after and a
[1689.84 - 1696.32] weakened immune cell goes after the
[1693.48 - 1699.20] weaker pathogen it goes after the one
[1696.32 - 1701.92] that seems like the less aggressive and
[1699.20 - 1704.96] the one that's the least amount of
[1701.92 - 1709.96] trouble when it goes after that
[1704.96 - 1713.36] pathogen like this to eat it up and to
[1709.96 - 1717.88] take it out something happens as it's
[1713.36 - 1721.40] doing it a stronger pathogen will come
[1717.88 - 1724.92] and rage war with the weakened
[1721.40 - 1728.08] cell so then we have a problem on our
[1724.92 - 1732.24] hands the stronger pathogen will rage
[1728.08 - 1736.24] War by going to save the other pathogen
[1732.24 - 1741.72] yes viruses save
[1736.24 - 1743.96] viruses but bugs save bugs bugs join
[1741.72 - 1746.92] together and gang up on the immune
[1743.96 - 1749.60] system bugs join together and gang up on
[1746.92 - 1751.80] your organs your glands your thyroid
[1749.60 - 1754.28] your liver your pancreas your spleen
[1751.80 - 1756.56] your intestinal tract your brain your
[1754.28 - 1759.12] heart they gang
[1756.56 - 1762.00] up they smell
[1759.12 - 1765.04] weakness and pathogens can even fight
[1762.00 - 1767.80] each other too for the
[1765.04 - 1769.68] prize sometimes you'll get a pathogen
[1767.80 - 1772.12] that will not just gang up and join
[1769.68 - 1774.00] another pathogen but that pathogen will
[1772.12 - 1776.16] go and fight another pathogen for the
[1774.00 - 1778.72] prize because it wants to take out the
[1776.16 - 1782.04] immune cell why because when it eats up
[1778.72 - 1784.56] the immune cell it learns information
[1782.04 - 1788.00] about your immune system it digests and
[1784.56 - 1790.24] gobbles up critical secret
[1788.00 - 1792.08] information that your immune system
[1790.24 - 1794.64] holds and harbors
[1792.08 - 1797.84] intelligence and the pathogen gains from
[1794.64 - 1800.60] it every time a pathogen wins a war wins
[1797.84 - 1803.32] a battle against an immune cell it
[1800.60 - 1805.92] gleans information and
[1803.32 - 1808.56] Intel and when it does that it
[1805.92 - 1811.40] strengthens it for another war and
[1808.56 - 1813.72] another battle we walk around with
[1811.40 - 1816.16] broken immune systems every single day
[1813.72 - 1818.28] you see it out there anyone with the
[1816.16 - 1820.88] problem you talk to anybody well I got
[1818.28 - 1823.16] an acne problem broken immune system
[1820.88 - 1826.20] well I got you know an ovarian cyst
[1823.16 - 1828.64] broken immune system well I got PCOS I
[1826.20 - 1830.24] get endometriosis broken immune system
[1828.64 - 1833.64] well I got this and this and this and
[1830.24 - 1835.16] this and it's endless it's endless and
[1833.64 - 1837.72] it's not supposed to be like this it's
[1835.16 - 1839.88] not supposed to be like this we're not
[1837.72 - 1843.72] supposed to be this sick we're not
[1839.88 - 1845.36] supposed to be a country and a world
[1843.72 - 1848.48] filled with
[1845.36 - 1850.04] sickness Global sickness we're not
[1848.48 - 1853.48] supposed to be like
[1850.04 - 1859.24] that as that immune cell gets destroyed
[1853.48 - 1859.24] and eaten up and annihilated by Invaders
[1859.52 - 1863.52] the
[1860.60 - 1866.44] Invaders learn information in
[1863.52 - 1869.92] Intel that makes it so when the next
[1866.44 - 1869.92] immune cell is
[1869.96 - 1875.52] born okay the next immune cell is
[1876.24 - 1881.88] born there's intelligence inside the
[1879.60 - 1884.04] pathogens that they're passing down two
[1881.88 - 1887.64] other pathogens about what the
[1884.04 - 1889.88] weaknesses were inside that immune cell
[1887.64 - 1893.32] so that they don't lose the fight with
[1889.88 - 1895.44] the new immune cell that's how it works
[1893.32 - 1898.28] that's why people stay
[1895.44 - 1902.36] sick one of the reasons why they just
[1898.28 - 1904.92] stay and stay sick and 20 years of
[1902.36 - 1907.40] sickness and 30 years of
[1904.92 - 1908.68] sickness Chris me perspective haven't
[1907.40 - 1910.44] seen you in a while that's why
[1908.68 - 1912.40] everything you teach is focused on
[1910.44 - 1914.28] building the immune system makes so much
[1912.40 - 1917.56] sense that's why I'm screaming from the
[1914.28 - 1920.20] rooftops about the immune system medical
[1917.56 - 1921.64] Med information helps people's adrenals
[1920.20 - 1924.20] it restores people that are dealing with
[1921.64 - 1926.20] Crohn's and Colitis and gut problems it
[1924.20 - 1927.48] helps people with acid reflux it helps
[1926.20 - 1930.08] people with all kinds of different
[1927.48 - 1934.84] conditions and symptoms but I talk about
[1930.08 - 1934.84] the immune system for a reason a
[1936.56 - 1942.88] reason okay and it's also why when a
[1939.72 - 1946.20] immune system tools come
[1942.88 - 1949.52] out I am freaking out because I'm so
[1946.20 - 1951.24] excited okay and maybe you don't maybe
[1949.52 - 1952.64] you don't care and you don't care about
[1951.24 - 1954.36] your immune system and you don't care
[1952.64 - 1956.20] about you know a product that has come
[1954.36 - 1959.44] out for the immune system and it's not
[1956.20 - 1961.36] your thing and that's you don't care but
[1959.44 - 1963.72] somebody else might care somebody else
[1961.36 - 1965.56] might care and I'm showing you right
[1963.72 - 1969.12] here that product right there total
[1965.56 - 1971.36] immune is critical I can't even tell you
[1969.12 - 1973.76] can't even tell you enough Uma says how
[1971.36 - 1976.56] come these bugs have such
[1973.76 - 1980.52] intelligence because they were raised by
[1976.56 - 1984.44] humans in labs they were all raised by
[1980.52 - 1986.96] humans and labs in eggs they cut the top
[1984.44 - 1990.24] of the egg off they inseminate the
[1986.96 - 1993.32] actual pathogen inside the egg the
[1990.24 - 1995.32] pathogen is raised inside the egg and
[1993.32 - 1997.68] then they're able to manipulate and use
[1995.32 - 2002.64] these pathogens once they come out in
[1997.68 - 2005.60] experimental ways on animals and even
[2002.64 - 2007.76] humans and these pathogens are smart
[2005.60 - 2009.16] they gain Intel
[2007.76 - 2010.48] intelligence so we got more to talk
[2009.16 - 2013.40] about with
[2010.48 - 2016.24] this okay and pathogens
[2013.40 - 2018.36] outli people unless you break them out
[2016.24 - 2022.00] break them down and beat them down and
[2018.36 - 2024.48] kill them they outli people people live
[2022.00 - 2026.28] a whole life of sickness because their
[2024.48 - 2029.00] immune system is broken and the
[2026.28 - 2032.32] pathogens are sitting there winning
[2029.00 - 2033.88] until finally the person has too many
[2032.32 - 2035.92] things going around too many things
[2033.88 - 2037.12] going on they got this and they got this
[2035.92 - 2039.44] and they got this and they got this this
[2037.12 - 2042.48] and they got this and finally they get
[2039.44 - 2046.40] older and or younger happens all the
[2042.48 - 2049.44] time and they just go and they leave
[2046.40 - 2051.56] here pathogens survive over time taking
[2049.44 - 2054.24] out more and more people's immune
[2051.56 - 2056.36] systems and they learn and adapt and
[2054.24 - 2057.68] then we pass that pathogen along to
[2056.36 - 2060.96] somebody
[2057.68 - 2062.84] else cu the pathogen mutated and then we
[2060.96 - 2065.08] pass that mutated pathogen on to
[2062.84 - 2067.48] somebody else and that's why medical M
[2065.08 - 2069.64] talks about so much other stuff
[2067.48 - 2071.80] medical medium information talks about
[2069.64 - 2073.16] like the toilet seats and you guys know
[2071.80 - 2075.16] that intricate information in the
[2073.16 - 2077.00] medical medium books right talk about
[2075.16 - 2078.60] like relationships and all kinds of
[2077.00 - 2080.80] different things how we pass bugs around
[2078.60 - 2082.48] and that's okay if we pass bugs around
[2080.80 - 2083.84] that's okay but we have to be proactive
[2082.48 - 2085.88] we have to know what we're doing we have
[2083.84 - 2088.00] to build up our immune system we have to
[2085.88 - 2090.72] starve the pathogens of foods that the
[2088.00 - 2093.80] pathogens eat we have to
[2090.72 - 2096.60] starve those pathogens and I want to I
[2093.80 - 2098.88] want to show you some War stuff okay a
[2096.60 - 2101.28] new cell is
[2098.88 - 2106.56] born every
[2101.28 - 2108.76] minute a new cell is born that new cell
[2106.56 - 2111.04] along with many other cells born every
[2108.76 - 2115.60] single
[2111.04 - 2117.44] minute is there but now it's up against
[2115.60 - 2120.04] the army of bugs that have a higher
[2117.44 - 2122.80] intelligence level and it kind of does
[2120.04 - 2124.84] the same thing it admits some strength
[2122.80 - 2126.96] out but not a lot because it's a weak
[2124.84 - 2128.68] and broken cell it's got It's an immune
[2126.96 - 2131.04] cell that's contaminated with toxic
[2128.68 - 2133.44] heavy metals air fresheners all kinds of
[2131.04 - 2135.08] different fragrances fragrance soaps
[2133.44 - 2138.48] this and this all these different
[2135.08 - 2140.56] chemicals you name it right it's a cell
[2138.48 - 2143.36] that's already hindered already beaten
[2140.56 - 2146.20] down and so it's emitting only so much
[2143.36 - 2148.60] energy sometimes it'll just be like this
[2146.20 - 2151.00] but not here and here so you'll have
[2148.60 - 2153.80] energy coming down energy going up but
[2151.00 - 2156.40] you don't have energy going here or
[2153.80 - 2159.88] here all the different pathogens are
[2156.40 - 2163.00] wise ER they're a day wiser they're an
[2159.88 - 2164.80] immune cell smarter and so it comes down
[2163.00 - 2167.44] to this again the immune cell goes
[2164.80 - 2171.12] seeking out the pathogens or runs into
[2167.44 - 2173.40] the pathogens it emits a tranquil lizer
[2171.12 - 2178.44] a Spellbound
[2173.40 - 2178.44] energy okay it emits the
[2178.48 - 2185.92] energy that's what it does admits it it
[2182.28 - 2190.80] even spins around the cell turns around
[2185.92 - 2190.80] and turns around and turns around
[2192.00 - 2198.44] like and then as it's turning
[2195.48 - 2200.56] around and doing that it goes up against
[2198.44 - 2202.28] the pathogens if the cell is strong
[2200.56 - 2204.68] enough the cell will go for a strong
[2202.28 - 2207.80] enough pathogen it'll go for a stronger
[2204.68 - 2210.28] one if the cell is too weak it'll go to
[2207.80 - 2212.84] a weaker one and the same thing happens
[2210.28 - 2215.84] again it goes into
[2212.84 - 2218.44] war and it fights for its life to save
[2215.84 - 2223.32] you it might might win it might eat up
[2218.44 - 2226.40] the doile the docile pathogen but then
[2223.32 - 2230.20] the one that's not so docile will come
[2226.40 - 2231.80] in get into it break it down and explode
[2230.20 - 2234.96] it and then what you'll have is an
[2231.80 - 2238.28] immune cell that just exploded and
[2234.96 - 2242.04] died that's how it
[2238.28 - 2245.40] works and the game goes on and goes on
[2242.04 - 2248.36] and goes on every day every hour as
[2245.40 - 2250.20] we're sick
[2248.36 - 2251.44] that's why medical medium has been
[2250.20 - 2254.12] sitting
[2251.44 - 2256.88] there talking and talking and talking
[2254.12 - 2260.40] about Epstein bar talking about the flu
[2256.88 - 2262.68] talking about all of it all this time
[2260.40 - 2265.44] that's why medical meme
[2262.68 - 2268.20] information was the first to put out the
[2265.44 - 2270.08] Long Haul flu the flu breaking down your
[2268.20 - 2271.88] immune system then being sick for months
[2270.08 - 2274.16] because of the flu and then science took
[2271.88 - 2277.48] it years and years and years later and
[2274.16 - 2279.36] we have that documented by the way
[2277.48 - 2281.96] and so and nowadays pathogens are
[2279.36 - 2284.84] getting so strong we can do all the
[2281.96 - 2286.76] right things and still we struggle to
[2284.84 - 2289.72] fend them off because pathogens have
[2286.76 - 2291.52] gotten stronger out there and so we have
[2289.72 - 2293.24] to build up the immune systems is what
[2291.52 - 2294.92] we have to do we have to build our
[2293.24 - 2297.44] immune systems up so let's do a little
[2294.92 - 2297.44] bit more
[2305.52 - 2309.12] here
[2307.84 - 2312.60] you'll see a big difference when you're
[2309.12 - 2316.32] using the right tools have to have the
[2312.60 - 2319.00] right tools it's critical big part of it
[2316.32 - 2320.44] because we can make immune cells strong
[2319.00 - 2321.88] they need to be fed so let's go into
[2320.44 - 2325.48] that part
[2321.88 - 2327.08] next you got a brand new immune cell
[2325.48 - 2330.68] okay it's
[2327.08 - 2333.52] weakened it's born weak it's not
[2330.68 - 2337.24] emitting a lot of power
[2333.52 - 2341.56] okay but it's hungry it's
[2337.24 - 2343.60] hungry our immune cells are starving for
[2341.56 - 2347.04] the right
[2343.60 - 2349.04] things and we put Foods in there that
[2347.04 - 2352.20] are not the right
[2349.04 - 2354.44] things we put eggs in there we put dairy
[2352.20 - 2355.76] in there we put gluten in there we put a
[2354.44 - 2358.48] whole bunch of things that I've talked
[2355.76 - 2360.28] about in there we put corn in there we
[2358.48 - 2362.76] put all kinds of stuff in our body and
[2360.28 - 2365.24] then we do high fat high fat high fat we
[2362.76 - 2367.16] fat ourselves to death and when we just
[2365.24 - 2368.88] pump in the fat the all all the overt
[2367.16 - 2371.44] fat we pump in because everybody that's
[2368.88 - 2373.32] what their meals are it's all fat and
[2371.44 - 2375.72] when they pump in all that fat we lower
[2373.32 - 2378.04] the immune system more and we starve the
[2375.72 - 2380.44] immune cells so what people have are
[2378.04 - 2383.56] starving immune cells our immune cells
[2380.44 - 2385.72] want to thrive they want
[2383.56 - 2387.64] Fuel and so when you look in the medical
[2385.72 - 2388.76] medium books you'll see in there all
[2387.64 - 2392.08] kinds of
[2388.76 - 2395.56] stuff stuff that feeds the immune
[2392.08 - 2398.88] cells that's critical for it how many
[2395.56 - 2402.00] times have I talked about time tea
[2398.88 - 2404.60] time right the herb
[2402.00 - 2408.04] time how many times have I been here
[2404.60 - 2410.24] live with you guys and talked about time
[2408.04 - 2412.40] I don't know so many I can't count them
[2410.24 - 2414.80] where I had a whole thing of time water
[2412.40 - 2416.88] and I'm putting fresh time right in
[2414.80 - 2418.72] there in the water and I'm like time you
[2416.88 - 2421.88] guys
[2418.72 - 2423.00] time how many times have I told you
[2421.88 - 2425.36] about
[2423.00 - 2429.20] time
[2425.36 - 2431.36] okay tools that we need and so what I
[2429.20 - 2434.24] love about time is time doesn't just
[2431.36 - 2438.80] feed the immune
[2434.24 - 2438.80] cell it doesn't just feed the immune
[2439.04 - 2445.28] cell okay it
[2442.28 - 2445.28] also
[2445.56 - 2452.20] inhibits the
[2448.52 - 2455.52] bugs when we have immune system problems
[2452.20 - 2458.16] we need things that inhibit the bad guys
[2455.52 - 2460.92] not just pour and feed our immune system
[2458.16 - 2462.76] Julie Tuesday 144 by the way I read your
[2460.92 - 2464.00] comments all the time you're you're like
[2462.76 - 2468.24] you're always just putting out some
[2464.00 - 2471.12] great stuff by the way um and then Sandy
[2468.24 - 2472.68] says what brand is the immune blend in
[2471.12 - 2475.72] viy right
[2472.68 - 2476.80] there vimergy V is in Victor i m is in
[2475.72 - 2480.48] Mary E
[2476.80 - 2482.20] rgy vimergy.com total immune blend
[2480.48 - 2484.32] that's it right there it's time and
[2482.20 - 2486.72] Mullen with a little bit of zinc the
[2484.32 - 2487.72] link is in the description you have to
[2486.72 - 2491.16] check this
[2487.72 - 2493.28] out I am taking that every day right now
[2491.16 - 2495.16] if the link is in the bio check it out
[2493.28 - 2498.72] if you can
[2495.16 - 2498.72] okay that's it right
[2500.68 - 2506.96] there putting a little bit in here here
[2504.12 - 2509.44] you go I just put two droppers right in
[2506.96 - 2509.44] the shot
[2509.72 - 2514.60] glass B to give me another one so what's
[2513.36 - 2517.88] happening out there is women's immune
[2514.60 - 2519.60] systems are lowering rapidly
[2517.88 - 2521.68] that's what's happening in our
[2519.60 - 2524.64] world the women on this planet are
[2521.68 - 2526.56] getting sick sicker than they ever were
[2524.64 - 2527.76] 50 years ago sicker than they ever were
[2526.56 - 2532.48] 40 years
[2527.76 - 2535.40] ago for the last two decades I've been
[2532.48 - 2539.20] saying and even before
[2535.40 - 2541.40] then that life expectancy is dropping
[2539.20 - 2543.56] but they're not reporting it life
[2541.40 - 2545.16] expectancy is dropping but they're not
[2543.56 - 2548.20] reporting
[2545.16 - 2549.96] it I have I've said this I've written it
[2548.20 - 2552.12] in the books I've put it information
[2549.96 - 2554.92] from s so in the books how life
[2552.12 - 2556.48] expectancy is dropping but no no no
[2554.92 - 2558.00] science is like we're only getting
[2556.48 - 2559.96] better and better life expectancy is
[2558.00 - 2562.20] getting better people are living longer
[2559.96 - 2564.52] than ever before that's what they're
[2562.20 - 2567.24] saying we have the technology we have
[2564.52 - 2569.36] the medical technology and Kno how the
[2567.24 - 2571.80] how to do we have it all people are
[2569.36 - 2574.28] living longer and we should be Su we
[2571.80 - 2579.16] should be proud of our
[2574.28 - 2581.52] successes but it was a lot Li it was a
[2579.16 - 2584.24] lie Spirit of compassion always told me
[2581.52 - 2586.60] it was a lie and it was and now they're
[2584.24 - 2589.12] faced with it they have no choice life
[2586.60 - 2591.88] expectancy is actually dropping life
[2589.12 - 2593.52] expectancy is dropping fast they know
[2591.88 - 2595.20] this they have it on record and they're
[2593.52 - 2598.00] still not reporting it correctly it's
[2595.20 - 2600.40] dropping faster and more grave than what
[2598.00 - 2602.36] they actually document it's even
[2600.40 - 2604.84] dropping faster than now what they're
[2602.36 - 2607.44] saying it's dropping medical me
[2604.84 - 2609.92] information was right once again again
[2607.44 - 2612.56] and proven right once again and that's
[2609.92 - 2614.92] the thing people who they make fun of mm
[2612.56 - 2618.20] info or me and they tell somebody keep
[2614.92 - 2620.96] in mind that it's proven right all the
[2618.20 - 2623.08] time constantly Pro way ahead of science
[2620.96 - 2625.40] and research over and over again and the
[2623.08 - 2628.12] life life expectancy is one of those
[2625.40 - 2630.60] things right there it's a medical medium
[2628.12 - 2632.48] win in the sense we're having Advanced
[2630.60 - 2633.72] information so you can protect yourself
[2632.48 - 2635.44] and you can look out for yourself and
[2633.72 - 2638.00] not be like well you know we're living
[2635.44 - 2640.52] forever I don't have to take care of
[2638.00 - 2642.80] myself they're saying life expectancy is
[2640.52 - 2644.56] just boo we're we're doing greater than
[2642.80 - 2646.24] ever the medical world has everything
[2644.56 - 2648.40] for me I could just live forever and
[2646.24 - 2649.60] ever I don't need to take care of myself
[2648.40 - 2650.84] that's why I call it a medical medium
[2649.60 - 2652.44] win it's because when you have the
[2650.84 - 2654.04] knowledge you get empowered and you can
[2652.44 - 2656.16] protect yourself what an incredible
[2654.04 - 2658.32] thing women's immune systems are
[2656.16 - 2660.16] lowering they already have immune system
[2658.32 - 2663.20] challenges during their cycle because
[2660.16 - 2665.00] menstration lowers the immune system
[2663.20 - 2668.92] menstration lowers the immune system by
[2665.00 - 2671.44] 80% 20% of the immune
[2668.92 - 2673.60] system is looking after the rest of the
[2671.44 - 2675.24] body why 80% of of women's immune system
[2673.60 - 2676.96] is looking after the reproductive system
[2675.24 - 2678.60] and when this happens you catch the flu
[2676.96 - 2681.52] you catch the ebvs you catch the
[2678.60 - 2684.64] simplexes you catch the hhv6 you catch
[2681.52 - 2686.24] the shingles I forgot that one too you
[2684.64 - 2688.16] catch them all that's how it works
[2686.24 - 2690.08] people pass them around we get them we
[2688.16 - 2692.36] pick them up we get the strep all of it
[2690.08 - 2695.68] now we're sick with weird sinusitis and
[2692.36 - 2697.56] we're sick with weird UTI we never had
[2695.68 - 2699.08] and then then your acne kicks up that's
[2697.56 - 2701.20] the strep all on its own during you
[2699.08 - 2704.36] never noticed that women in their Cycles
[2701.20 - 2706.32] they have their cycle pre-cycle post um
[2704.36 - 2708.44] during cycle present cycle and post
[2706.32 - 2711.16] cycle all a sudden the acne kicks
[2708.44 - 2712.68] up it's like why is my acne kicking up
[2711.16 - 2714.36] during my cycle because the immune
[2712.68 - 2715.56] system is lowering that's why the immune
[2714.36 - 2717.68] system is
[2715.56 - 2719.08] lowering it's not hormones it's the
[2717.68 - 2721.08] immune system lowering that's how it
[2719.08 - 2724.20] goes and then shrep and pathogens kick
[2721.08 - 2725.92] up and they drive up right so women are
[2724.20 - 2728.16] already dealing with immune system
[2725.92 - 2731.24] challenges all on their own and then
[2728.16 - 2733.40] when we have pathogens plenty of them we
[2731.24 - 2737.36] end up in trouble again so we have the
[2733.40 - 2740.68] EBV we got that one right we got the
[2737.36 - 2744.92] strep got the HH you know we got the
[2740.68 - 2747.64] Herby Simplex right and the list goes on
[2744.92 - 2750.12] hhv7 you'll hear a lot about that pretty
[2747.64 - 2751.40] soon I've been talking about hhv7 for
[2750.12 - 2752.52] years and years and years you guys are
[2751.40 - 2753.48] going to hear a lot about that and then
[2752.52 - 2756.80] once again you're going be like medical
[2753.48 - 2760.24] M was right his information was right
[2756.80 - 2760.24] never ends
[2764.52 - 2769.04] okay all right so let's keep on going
[2767.92 - 2770.24] because we still have more to talk about
[2769.04 - 2772.68] the immune system and everything about
[2770.24 - 2774.56] it it's important Sayes says yep I
[2772.68 - 2776.24] always get colds around my period and
[2774.56 - 2778.44] that happens to so many women they get
[2776.24 - 2780.64] colds it gets flu they get pneumonia
[2778.44 - 2783.00] they get bronchitis during their period
[2780.64 - 2784.96] and around their period okay so we got a
[2783.00 - 2786.92] brand new immune cell that brand new IM
[2784.96 - 2789.40] immune cell is actually emitting lots of
[2786.92 - 2791.04] energy right on different parts of it
[2789.40 - 2793.52] still a little weaker on the sides but
[2791.04 - 2795.84] it needs to be fed because it's starving
[2793.52 - 2795.84] it's
[2796.28 - 2800.36] starving I don't know if that helps you
[2798.36 - 2803.36] guys I'm running starving upside down
[2800.36 - 2808.28] right there the immune cells are
[2803.36 - 2808.28] starving they need fuel in order to
[2809.00 - 2816.00] fight they need a little bit of zinc
[2812.16 - 2817.20] they need Molen they need th right they
[2816.00 - 2819.60] need the
[2817.20 - 2823.04] propolis the incredible
[2819.60 - 2826.08] propolis that I talk about and show you
[2823.04 - 2828.56] guys they need the licorice they need
[2826.08 - 2832.04] the golden
[2828.56 - 2835.60] seal they need things they're
[2832.04 - 2839.52] hungry okay so let's go into this
[2835.60 - 2842.60] now all right immune cells have to be
[2839.52 - 2844.44] fed they can't exist on their own cells
[2842.60 - 2846.28] need to be fed every single cell in your
[2844.44 - 2848.44] body needs fuel
[2846.28 - 2850.16] it needs the right trace minerals it
[2848.44 - 2852.28] needs phytochemical
[2850.16 - 2854.80] compounds it needs all these different
[2852.28 - 2858.12] things that are in our food which is
[2854.80 - 2862.12] critical I wish we only needed
[2858.12 - 2865.00] food I wish we only needed food and food
[2862.12 - 2867.44] only in this world that would be
[2865.00 - 2869.64] incredible and we do need food and
[2867.44 - 2872.44] listen a lot of people get better just
[2869.64 - 2874.44] on celery juice just on one thing just
[2872.44 - 2876.76] on some tools just on the healing broth
[2874.44 - 2878.12] just on the spinach soup I know people
[2876.76 - 2880.00] that say look I'm going to do spinach
[2878.12 - 2881.40] soup for like two weeks aw I'm like
[2880.00 - 2882.48] that's incredible they do spinach soup
[2881.40 - 2883.96] for two weeks they don't do anything
[2882.48 - 2885.52] else and they just start healing and
[2883.96 - 2886.88] they start recovering right the medical
[2885.52 - 2890.04] mem spinach
[2886.88 - 2892.00] soup the point is is that we can do a
[2890.04 - 2893.96] lot with food and we need to keep that
[2892.00 - 2896.28] food going in we got to keep the bad
[2893.96 - 2899.28] stuff out when we can we got to keep the
[2896.28 - 2901.56] bad stuff out right we got to keep the
[2899.28 - 2902.92] gluten out and all the vinegar is out
[2901.56 - 2906.64] and everything else we got to keep the
[2902.92 - 2908.28] bad stuff out because it it boggles down
[2906.64 - 2910.96] our immune
[2908.28 - 2913.16] cells but we need things that feed the
[2910.96 - 2914.76] immune system friend of mine eat
[2913.16 - 2916.80] something similar to this right now what
[2914.76 - 2919.08] you're seeing see I don't shun my
[2916.80 - 2922.32] friends just because they do
[2919.08 - 2923.68] things I don't shun you know what I I
[2922.32 - 2924.76] hear this all the time out there I hear
[2923.68 - 2926.24] like there's all kinds of spiritual
[2924.76 - 2928.20] gurus there's all kinds of like Health
[2926.24 - 2929.88] gurus out there I hear about and they
[2928.20 - 2933.72] they get rid of their friends that don't
[2929.88 - 2936.36] do what they what they what they preach
[2933.72 - 2939.64] they get rid of them they like shame
[2936.36 - 2941.00] them and shun them I got friends going
[2939.64 - 2944.60] back
[2941.00 - 2947.04] decades and I you know and they don't do
[2944.60 - 2948.44] they might do something like Vape they
[2947.04 - 2949.92] might do something like eat a big old
[2948.44 - 2953.24] hogy with all kinds of vinegar and
[2949.92 - 2956.12] cheese on it but I don't shun them I
[2953.24 - 2959.16] don't punish them and I don't judge them
[2956.12 - 2961.44] it's a hard world out there hard world
[2959.16 - 2962.64] but what I do do is when I run across a
[2961.44 - 2964.60] friend who's eating something like this
[2962.64 - 2965.92] I'll be like well that's feeding the
[2964.60 - 2968.04] immune system right there they're like
[2965.92 - 2970.64] what is that I'm like that's lettuce
[2968.04 - 2972.92] that's lettuce that's feeding the immune
[2970.64 - 2974.28] cells right there and they're like okay
[2972.92 - 2976.96] what else is feeding the immune cells in
[2974.28 - 2978.28] here aw I'll be like oh there's a tomato
[2976.96 - 2979.96] you see that tomato right there that
[2978.28 - 2982.28] tomato in your sand which is feeding the
[2979.96 - 2983.44] immune cells you see that right there
[2982.28 - 2985.32] and they're like all excited they're
[2983.44 - 2987.16] like oh my God I can't believe it a w
[2985.32 - 2990.72] this is amazing I got some stuff that's
[2987.16 - 2990.72] feeding the immune cells and then I
[2991.92 - 2997.60] go see that pami right there that's not
[2995.28 - 3000.32] health helping the immune cells it's
[2997.60 - 3002.28] just not helping you see that cheese
[3000.32 - 3005.84] that prolon cheese on your hogy right
[3002.28 - 3006.60] there that's feeding the bad guys
[3005.84 - 3008.00] they're like what do you mean it's
[3006.60 - 3009.76] feeding the bad guys that's feeding the
[3008.00 - 3011.20] bad guys you see that bread right here
[3009.76 - 3013.60] like Bread's good for you right bread
[3011.20 - 3016.44] whole grain bread that is the gluten
[3013.60 - 3017.96] it's feeding the bad guys it's not
[3016.44 - 3020.00] feeding yourselves and they be like see
[3017.96 - 3022.04] this right here but yeah onions I love
[3020.00 - 3023.80] onions that's an onion that's feeding
[3022.04 - 3026.08] your immune
[3023.80 - 3028.00] cells that's feeding feting them and
[3026.08 - 3032.04] strengthening them so what you have
[3028.00 - 3035.88] right here is good and evil Darkness and
[3032.04 - 3038.20] Light you can just all box it up and
[3035.88 - 3042.60] package it up into like Darkness and
[3038.20 - 3045.00] Light a spiritual war right here in a
[3042.60 - 3046.44] sandwich you got some foods in here that
[3045.00 - 3048.48] are trying to save you and feed your
[3046.44 - 3049.80] immune cells you got some foods in here
[3048.48 - 3052.12] are trying to take down your immune
[3049.80 - 3056.84] cells by feeding all the pathogens it's
[3052.12 - 3060.80] dark and light it's good and evil
[3056.84 - 3060.80] all packed up right here in a
[3062.68 - 3070.76] sandwich and our immune cells they
[3066.64 - 3073.52] need support and they need things okay
[3070.76 - 3076.28] so why have I always been like time time
[3073.52 - 3079.08] tea time
[3076.28 - 3081.04] tea because time is critical for our
[3079.08 - 3082.84] immune systems and what we go through it
[3081.04 - 3086.72] is one of the big ones right there and
[3082.84 - 3089.00] I've been waiting waiting
[3086.72 - 3091.04] for vimergy to come and outdo themselves
[3089.00 - 3093.20] once again and put together something
[3091.04 - 3094.64] that's so mind-blowing to me so
[3093.20 - 3098.28] mindblowing and I don't care what
[3094.64 - 3100.92] anybody thinks I don't care what anybody
[3098.28 - 3102.48] thinks like oh there's a w with
[3100.92 - 3104.08] something let me tell you something I
[3102.48 - 3105.96] got my family on this I got my friends
[3104.08 - 3107.64] on this and we're going we're in January
[3105.96 - 3111.24] in the new year now and all I hear is
[3107.64 - 3114.76] people out there like sick sick again
[3111.24 - 3117.16] I'm sick I got the Mullen in here going
[3114.76 - 3120.68] in me I got some time in here going in
[3117.16 - 3122.72] me when I take this Mullen for the lungs
[3120.68 - 3125.24] I got the time for the immune system I
[3122.72 - 3127.24] got both like that is something that I'm
[3125.24 - 3129.32] excited about like I'm passionate about
[3127.24 - 3131.72] this I'm excited about this because more
[3129.32 - 3134.48] tools that I know can feed an immune
[3131.72 - 3136.80] cell and help restore it and fight the
[3134.48 - 3139.12] evil the darkness the pathogens that are
[3136.80 - 3142.76] out there so that we have a better
[3139.12 - 3145.04] quality of life is key having a better
[3142.76 - 3147.80] quality of life existing here on planet
[3145.04 - 3150.64] Earth in a better frame of mind in a
[3147.80 - 3153.60] better healing mode in a better
[3150.64 - 3156.00] place that's what matters right there
[3153.60 - 3159.32] right there so that's the total immune
[3156.00 - 3162.72] blend it's got the Mullen it's got the
[3159.32 - 3164.64] thyme I never doubt the Vim stuff
[3162.72 - 3166.16] because they take it to the next level
[3164.64 - 3168.12] and they always surprise me and they
[3166.16 - 3169.84] take it to the best that you can find
[3168.12 - 3172.28] out there what you won't find in here
[3169.84 - 3173.84] right here okay you won't find alcohol
[3172.28 - 3175.52] you won't find natural flavors but it's
[3173.84 - 3179.12] not just that you won't find citric acid
[3175.52 - 3183.56] it's not just that you won't find dried
[3179.12 - 3187.00] herbs dried powdered herbs that have no
[3183.56 - 3189.04] power in them and I see that in all the
[3187.00 - 3191.64] tinctures now I see that in all the
[3189.04 - 3194.80] capsule herbal powders now what you'll
[3191.64 - 3197.40] find in here is a powerful potency and
[3194.80 - 3199.80] extract of th and Mullen that is
[3197.40 - 3201.36] mind-blowing it's right there okay I'm
[3199.80 - 3203.52] just
[3201.36 - 3205.80] saying and if it's something you can do
[3203.52 - 3208.24] for yourself amazing if you're not in a
[3205.80 - 3211.36] position to to get a bottle then maybe
[3208.24 - 3214.88] someday you will but it's that
[3211.36 - 3214.88] incredible I'm going to take a
[3215.32 - 3221.16] shot and it tastes delicious for some
[3217.64 - 3224.28] reason because you can taste the

[3246.48 - 3249.52] more about this incredible
[3251.44 - 3256.84] information
[3253.12 - 3259.88] okay strong cells we want strong cells
[3256.84 - 3259.88] let's get into that a little
[3260.16 - 3264.64] bit you have it in you to have the
[3263.00 - 3267.20] strongest immune cells I'm going to tell
[3264.64 - 3270.92] you right now you guys you have it in
[3267.20 - 3273.88] you to have the strongest immune cells
[3270.92 - 3277.32] okay you do I don't care if you've been
[3273.88 - 3280.44] sick for 20 years you have it in you to
[3277.32 - 3280.44] have the strongest immune
[3281.08 - 3288.44] cells try not to strip on that
[3285.32 - 3290.44] okay when you do stuff that's critical
[3288.44 - 3291.68] for your immune system when you get the
[3290.44 - 3293.72] junk out like in the medical meme
[3291.68 - 3296.20] information you're doing your hmds
[3293.72 - 3299.28] you're doing the things you need to do
[3296.20 - 3303.28] right yep verus spiritual tasting the
[3299.28 - 3305.32] healing exactly Kim says what is the
[3303.28 - 3308.52] name of the Bimmer product is called
[3305.32 - 3311.04] total immune blend is what it
[3308.52 - 3313.08] is total immune blend I'll put that
[3311.04 - 3315.52] right up to
[3313.08 - 3318.68] you
[3315.52 - 3321.96] okay a new immune cell is
[3318.68 - 3325.64] born another immune cell is
[3321.96 - 3330.24] born another one is born
[3325.64 - 3330.24] name them what you will they're all just
[3330.64 - 3336.00] names
[3332.68 - 3338.20] lymphocytes nutrifil basophils killer
[3336.00 - 3341.92] cells white blood cells name them what
[3338.20 - 3343.84] you want they're all just names but you
[3341.92 - 3345.56] got a host of immune cells inside your
[3343.84 - 3347.20] body they're all just names that some
[3345.56 - 3349.88] guy came up
[3347.20 - 3351.88] with right the medical industry is like
[3349.88 - 3353.60] well we think we found an immune cell we
[3351.88 - 3355.80] might name it let's name it okay we're
[3353.60 - 3357.48] going to name that one a lymphocyte oh I
[3355.80 - 3359.84] think we found it me cell again we're
[3357.48 - 3362.24] going to name that one something else
[3359.84 - 3365.40] they're just naming them
[3362.24 - 3367.28] right I I tend to not like try to use
[3365.40 - 3370.96] the names
[3367.28 - 3374.08] because is that the real
[3370.96 - 3375.80] name is that the real name of an immune
[3374.08 - 3377.92] cell I think about that all the time
[3375.80 - 3379.36] because every time I talk to S so s so
[3377.92 - 3380.76] is like yeah that's some guy in a lab
[3379.36 - 3383.20] that's like we're going to name that a
[3380.76 - 3383.20] killer
[3383.60 - 3390.04] cell so what what you have is your
[3385.64 - 3393.28] immune cells right they're born
[3390.04 - 3396.60] constantly and when you feed
[3393.28 - 3399.88] them they strengthen and they start to
[3396.60 - 3399.88] have the ability to gather more
[3400.32 - 3403.84] intelligence not only are pathogens
[3402.64 - 3406.52] highly
[3403.84 - 3409.16] intelligent not only are bad pathogens
[3406.52 - 3412.68] highly intelligent here's one right here
[3409.16 - 3415.56] an EBV here's a a shingles here's a um
[3412.68 - 3418.56] herpy simplex one right
[3415.56 - 3421.52] here's a strep antibiotic resistant
[3418.56 - 3424.04] strep not only are they
[3421.52 - 3426.32] intelligent and can get more intelligent
[3424.04 - 3428.80] as time goes on your immune cells can
[3426.32 - 3432.76] too but the only way for your immune
[3428.80 - 3435.04] cells to get smart is you have to feed
[3432.76 - 3437.16] them they need
[3435.04 - 3440.52] things they need
[3437.16 - 3440.52] garlic they need
[3440.60 - 3446.16] spirina they need things they need
[3443.16 - 3449.32] tomatoes they need Apple
[3446.16 - 3454.00] they need celery celery
[3449.32 - 3458.84] juice and then they need potent herbs
[3454.00 - 3462.32] Molin the total immune thyme the total
[3458.84 - 3462.32] immune they need
[3462.44 - 3467.84] zinc they need to be fed they need trace
[3465.80 - 3469.32] minerals phytochemical compounds within
[3467.84 - 3472.16] the
[3469.32 - 3475.64] herbs and as they get
[3472.16 - 3478.36] stronger and they win a battle
[3475.64 - 3480.28] okay and then they win a battle against
[3478.36 - 3483.28] an evil
[3480.28 - 3487.48] bug and that immune cell radiate
[3483.28 - 3490.64] strength and vibrancy and it weakens
[3487.48 - 3493.60] that pathogen and then it wins the
[3490.64 - 3496.76] battle quickly it it ascends upon that
[3493.60 - 3501.96] pathogen and then eats it
[3496.76 - 3505.28] up and cancels it out it now gains
[3501.96 - 3508.24] intelligence back it strengthens
[3505.28 - 3511.32] and it gains the intelligence
[3508.24 - 3514.16] back and then it's
[3511.32 - 3518.08] stronger it's smarter it goes for
[3514.16 - 3521.88] another one does the same thing weakens
[3518.08 - 3523.88] it crushes it and gains intelligence and
[3521.88 - 3526.48] then that immune cell might lose a
[3523.88 - 3529.12] battle because it's eating so many bad
[3526.48 - 3531.36] boys up so many of them up that if
[3529.12 - 3532.96] someone has a little too many of the
[3531.36 - 3535.12] ebvs and they got four different
[3532.96 - 3537.28] varieties of Epstein bar they got four
[3535.12 - 3539.72] two varieties of shingles and they got
[3537.28 - 3543.68] an HPV they got a ceglar virus they got
[3539.72 - 3546.36] a simplex one and that immune
[3543.68 - 3550.24] cell can't handle them all and
[3546.36 - 3550.24] eventually burns out like a
[3551.28 - 3554.64] star in the
[3554.96 - 3560.48] universe and when it burns
[3557.32 - 3560.48] out it
[3560.72 - 3566.00] dies but in that
[3563.64 - 3567.04] process it did something that you guys
[3566.00 - 3571.80] don't
[3567.04 - 3574.96] know you know what it did it passed down
[3571.80 - 3577.24] information to other immune cells look
[3574.96 - 3577.24] at
[3578.64 - 3584.72] that and then those immune cells pass
[3581.56 - 3587.48] down information to other immune
[3584.72 - 3589.80] cells and then the war goes on and
[3587.48 - 3592.44] you're winning the
[3589.80 - 3594.88] war your fibro is getting better your
[3592.44 - 3596.40] Lyme disease is getting better your ra
[3594.88 - 3597.76] is getting better your life is getting
[3596.40 - 3599.24] better whatever it is you have your
[3597.76 - 3601.12] autoimmune is getting better things are
[3599.24 - 3603.20] getting better your immune cells can
[3601.12 - 3605.40] strengthen when they're fed the right
[3603.20 - 3608.68] things they can grow and strengthen and
[3605.40 - 3608.68] they can beat out the bad
[3611.28 - 3616.36] guys and
[3614.24 - 3619.20] that's what it's all
[3616.36 - 3621.96] about right
[3619.20 - 3624.60] there medical medium tools are about
[3621.96 - 3626.96] destroying the bad guys cleaning out the
[3624.60 - 3629.44] junk that feeds the bad guys getting rid
[3626.96 - 3631.36] of the foods that feed the bad guys and
[3629.44 - 3634.20] supporting your immune system and your
[3631.36 - 3636.56] organs with the good stuff that's what
[3634.20 - 3639.00] it's about because people walk around
[3636.56 - 3640.84] with broken busted immune systems and
[3639.00 - 3642.84] they're sick and they stay sick and
[3640.84 - 3644.92] they're constantly flared up and they
[3642.84 - 3647.64] get flared up again and then somebody
[3644.92 - 3649.36] out there says go try this don't do that
[3647.64 - 3650.88] and they go try it they're flared up
[3649.36 - 3653.44] more and someone else is like no you
[3650.88 - 3655.56] should do this and only do this only do
[3653.44 - 3656.96] carnivore nothing else else and they
[3655.56 - 3659.68] just be like try that and they get
[3656.96 - 3661.52] sicker in six months and they like no
[3659.68 - 3663.12] just eat what you want just only eat
[3661.52 - 3665.12] what you want that makes you happy and
[3663.12 - 3667.52] then when you're happy you heal and they
[3665.12 - 3669.68] do that one and they're just like boom
[3667.52 - 3671.84] then now they're sick all over again or
[3669.68 - 3674.36] they'll be like do this one and do that
[3671.84 - 3677.56] that one and do this one it's never
[3674.36 - 3679.44] ending and mm info is about restoring
[3677.56 - 3681.44] those immune cells recovering them
[3679.44 - 3684.04] restoring them making them stronger
[3681.44 - 3687.72] getting the intelligence Factor up on
[3684.04 - 3691.48] all those immune cells so the intellect
[3687.72 - 3694.12] on each immune cell is strong powerful
[3691.48 - 3696.52] so admits what this is going to happen
[3694.12 - 3698.08] here as I clean this board one more time
[3696.52 - 3701.08] for you
[3698.08 - 3701.08] guys
[3703.08 - 3706.32] hello all
[3707.76 - 3711.04] right how's
[3713.44 - 3716.44] that
[3716.48 - 3721.08] a cell is born you've been working on
[3719.20 - 3723.32] your healing process for quite a while
[3721.08 - 3727.12] you've been doing your celery juice your
[3723.32 - 3727.12] hmds you've been using
[3727.92 - 3731.64] tools you've been working on your Foods
[3730.20 - 3734.16] you've been keeping out the foods that
[3731.64 - 3736.28] don't serve you I'm starting to use that
[3734.16 - 3739.52] term I don't like that term it's like
[3736.28 - 3742.60] whatever serves you that doesn't serve
[3739.52 - 3745.76] me people hear that all the time do what
[3742.60 - 3749.56] serves you it's like
[3745.76 - 3752.52] all of it keeping Foods out that do not
[3749.56 - 3756.64] help you
[3752.52 - 3759.20] okay and then a cell is born you guys
[3756.64 - 3761.24] that's right Envision that cell because
[3759.20 - 3765.48] that cell's inside of
[3761.24 - 3772.00] you envision it and see
[3765.48 - 3774.68] it a cell is born inside of you that has
[3772.00 - 3778.20] Intelligence and strength in and it
[3774.68 - 3781.16] wields a sword and that sword is going
[3778.20 - 3785.92] to go right through those pathogens and
[3781.16 - 3785.92] Destroy them the darkness and the
[3787.44 - 3792.80] evil a cell is
[3789.76 - 3796.16] born it's got a strength to it it's got
[3792.80 - 3798.84] no indentations it's not tattered it's
[3796.16 - 3801.00] got no divots in it it's got no pivots
[3798.84 - 3804.32] in it
[3801.00 - 3806.20] either the membrane is Juicy the me
[3804.32 - 3810.08] mebrane is
[3806.20 - 3813.12] strong and it admits that
[3810.08 - 3815.80] frequency but it admits it everywhere
[3813.12 - 3817.44] see this cuz you've been doing the work
[3815.80 - 3819.44] and you've been working on yourself and
[3817.44 - 3821.24] getting what you need and that strength
[3819.44 - 3823.56] is admitting
[3821.24 - 3825.92] everywhere and that's your immune cell
[3823.56 - 3828.76] right there you have it in you it's
[3825.92 - 3831.48] there and many of you have ignited those
[3828.76 - 3833.84] already and you have won battles after
[3831.48 - 3836.76] battles and you've gotten rid of 50
[3833.84 - 3839.32] symptoms I see it on YouTube I see it in
[3836.76 - 3840.96] your comment section I see it in so many
[3839.32 - 3845.44] like in the comment section you guys are
[3840.96 - 3845.44] leaving I read them all I read them
[3845.76 - 3851.40] all and you guys are winning those
[3848.84 - 3853.60] battles and your immune cell is crushing
[3851.40 - 3855.64] it and destroying those Invaders and
[3853.60 - 3858.80] those pathogens because you guys have
[3855.64 - 3861.32] been giving your immune cells what they
[3858.80 - 3863.44] need and that's your immune cell right
[3861.32 - 3866.48] there that you guys are building it is
[3863.44 - 3868.88] strong it is powerful it is nothing to
[3866.48 - 3871.84] be messed with and when an Invader comes
[3868.88 - 3875.72] around it crushes it when those Invaders
[3871.84 - 3878.36] come around the evbs and the simplexes
[3875.72 - 3880.44] and the shingles and the strep and maybe
[3878.36 - 3883.20] you don't know any you have any of this
[3880.44 - 3885.44] you're just sick then just do this then
[3883.20 - 3886.76] you're sick something's in you because
[3885.44 - 3888.28] you don't know maybe you didn't learn
[3886.76 - 3890.60] yet and you don't know the bugs that are
[3888.28 - 3892.76] in you you have no idea fine then
[3890.60 - 3894.84] something is just keeping you sick
[3892.76 - 3897.04] whatever it is
[3894.84 - 3898.60] in your head in the sense where you're
[3897.04 - 3900.16] really sick but in your head you're
[3898.60 - 3902.72] thinking I don't know why I'm sick
[3900.16 - 3903.68] something's doing it whatever it is that
[3902.72 - 3907.76] you
[3903.68 - 3910.24] believe your immune cell is strong and
[3907.76 - 3912.60] it's vital and it starts to spin around
[3910.24 - 3914.72] and spit around and spit around and what
[3912.60 - 3917.84] happens is that it's turning and science
[3914.72 - 3921.12] doesn't have that Peg they don't know
[3917.84 - 3923.08] about this they don't study a cell
[3921.12 - 3924.64] through its
[3923.08 - 3925.48] fruition
[3924.64 - 3927.96] they
[3925.48 - 3931.76] don't they don't study
[3927.96 - 3934.28] it from its birth because they don't
[3931.76 - 3935.56] follow a cell science doesn't know how
[3934.28 - 3937.68] to follow a cell they can't they don't
[3935.56 - 3940.16] have the technology to follow a
[3937.68 - 3941.64] cell they can't they can only they can't
[3940.16 - 3943.40] follow it in the body when it's coming
[3941.64 - 3944.72] out of a bone and then it's just growing
[3943.40 - 3946.16] through your and it's moving through
[3944.72 - 3949.40] your body they're not following it being
[3946.16 - 3952.48] like there's that cell we got our eye on
[3949.40 - 3954.04] it it's not like a bird that they're
[3952.48 - 3955.84] watching and they put a little tag at
[3954.04 - 3958.84] it's not a penguin they put a little tag
[3955.84 - 3960.76] in its ear because it's
[3958.84 - 3962.40] endangered and they're trying to keep an
[3960.76 - 3963.68] eye on it so they send some people up
[3962.40 - 3965.08] there to the Arctic and they're and
[3963.68 - 3967.40] they're looking for that penguin that
[3965.08 - 3968.08] actually has a little red tag in its ear
[3967.40 - 3971.20] it's
[3968.08 - 3975.36] fin It's
[3971.20 - 3978.04] Finn I don't know penguins have ears but
[3975.36 - 3980.84] keep in mind that that cell starts to
[3978.04 - 3983.76] spin and it starts to rotate and it has
[3980.84 - 3985.76] strength like no other and when you feed
[3983.76 - 3987.52] these cells they can turn into this and
[3985.76 - 3989.88] in your body you will have the strength
[3987.52 - 3991.92] and it will do this and then when it
[3989.88 - 3993.24] comes across these pathogens what it
[3991.92 - 3994.60] does and this is incredible I'm going to
[3993.24 - 3996.24] tell you right now and this is what some
[3994.60 - 3998.20] of you are doing right now when you do
[3996.24 - 4000.32] medical
[3998.20 - 4002.56] medium I can't speak for other
[4000.32 - 4004.88] modalities and other things out there
[4002.56 - 4006.64] and other whatever Lifestyles or
[4004.88 - 4008.64] whatever they call it out there I can't
[4006.64 - 4010.56] I can't speak for all those but I can
[4008.64 - 4012.64] speak for medical medium information and
[4010.56 - 4014.04] when your cell gets strong and stronger
[4012.64 - 4016.80] and stronger and it starts to Road
[4014.04 - 4018.96] rotate it runs across all the bad bugs
[4016.80 - 4022.12] right there and what it does it radiates
[4018.96 - 4024.72] this powerful powerful light out of that
[4022.12 - 4027.56] cell that blue light and as it radiates
[4024.72 - 4030.20] out it puts everything docile everything
[4027.56 - 4031.68] goes to sleep around it all your streps
[4030.20 - 4034.04] all your five different strips that are
[4031.68 - 4036.24] antibiotic resistant all your different
[4034.04 - 4038.52] ebvs that you have all your different
[4036.24 - 4040.96] shingles that you have everything it
[4038.52 - 4043.40] completely puts it into a trance like
[4040.96 - 4046.08] this you see this into a spell it spell
[4043.40 - 4048.84] bounds it and then it goes and it
[4046.08 - 4050.84] gobbles every single one of them up
[4048.84 - 4053.20] that's what it does all like this that's
[4050.84 - 4055.80] the cell we have it goes like this and
[4053.20 - 4058.28] it gobbles every last one of them up and
[4055.80 - 4060.48] it wipes it clean and then it heads down
[4058.28 - 4062.36] into your liver and it does it all over
[4060.48 - 4064.64] again and then you start healing on
[4062.36 - 4067.96] medical medium and you start recovering
[4064.64 - 4067.96] and that's what happens right
[4069.28 - 4073.16] there we are up against the strongest
[4071.56 - 4074.64] pathogens we've ever faced in history
[4073.16 - 4077.16] they're out there now they continue to
[4074.64 - 4081.36] strengthen but we don't have
[4077.16 - 4085.16] to live by that Madness can take care of
[4081.36 - 4085.16] ourselves do what we need for
[4085.76 - 4093.04] ourselves anyway check out total immune
[4089.88 - 4095.40] blend I hope you enjoyed the show it's
[4093.04 - 4098.52] information from Spirit of
[4095.40 - 4100.76] compassion I've been teaching on and off
[4098.52 - 4100.76] for
[4102.84 - 4109.16] years that I've been
[4105.16 - 4109.16] messaging all these all these
[4110.92 - 4115.40] years messaging to others they could
[4113.52 - 4117.80] become their own experts and they can
[4115.40 - 4120.00] teach
[4117.80 - 4123.04] others I wish I can call myself a
[4120.00 - 4125.44] teacher I want to so bad but I can't
[4123.04 - 4127.08] teacher is somebody who's a researcher
[4125.44 - 4129.20] and they learn through
[4127.08 - 4131.60] researching and then they go and teach
[4129.20 - 4133.56] it I don't learn through
[4131.60 - 4135.92] researching I want to call myself a
[4133.56 - 4137.40] teacher teacher bad but I can't cuz
[4135.92 - 4139.12] Spirit of compassion says you're not a
[4137.40 - 4141.16] teacher you're a
[4139.12 - 4145.04] messenger because I'm not out there
[4141.16 - 4148.28] researching I'm not out there you
[4145.04 - 4149.64] know doing all that and then teaching
[4148.28 - 4153.04] what I learned from the Internet or
[4149.64 - 4153.04] whatever and that's a
[4153.88 - 4158.84] teacher but I'm just a little old
[4157.04 - 4160.96] messenger and I have to accept that and
[4158.84 - 4162.72] be that CU I know people have a lot of
[4160.96 - 4164.24] respect for teachers and I don't know if
[4162.72 - 4167.64] they have a lot of respect for mess
[4164.24 - 4172.44] so but got to be what I got to
[4167.64 - 4174.36] be anyway check it out total immune
[4172.44 - 4177.48] blend right
[4174.36 - 4179.56] there link is in the bio I'm going to
[4177.48 - 4182.04] pop a little water in here and I'm going
[4179.56 - 4182.04] to send it
[4183.12 - 4188.72] down bartender give me another I'll take
[4186.84 - 4190.80] that have compassion for your body's
[4188.72 - 4192.56] immune systems have respect for your
[4190.80 - 4194.72] body's immune systems are working hard
[4192.56 - 4197.28] for you they're not attacking you
[4194.72 - 4198.96] they're not and that takes me to this
[4197.28 - 4200.84] next place of how evil things are out
[4198.96 - 4202.64] there because the industry both
[4200.84 - 4203.92] alternative medicine unfortunately and
[4202.64 - 4205.36] conventional medicine believe your
[4203.92 - 4207.12] body's attacking itself your body's
[4205.36 - 4208.40] immune system is going attacking itself
[4207.12 - 4210.16] that's why everybody's getting diagnosed
[4208.40 - 4212.24] with autoimmune because their immune
[4210.16 - 4213.72] cells are going after their thyroids and
[4212.24 - 4215.64] after their livers and after their
[4213.72 - 4218.80] hearts and everything else and it's not
[4215.64 - 4220.96] true it's not true it's a
[4218.80 - 4223.20] theory that isn't real your immune
[4220.96 - 4225.88] system loves you unconditionally it's
[4223.20 - 4230.48] looking at for you build it up make it
[4225.88 - 4233.08] strong tell it you love it yep Steph
[4230.48 - 4235.96] over there on IG says mm please describe
[4233.08 - 4238.16] what the total immune blend tastes just
[4235.96 - 4239.76] tastes amazing I'm not just saying it
[4238.16 - 4242.00] actually tastes really good I don't know
[4239.76 - 4245.72] why but it's really potent but it
[4242.00 - 4248.00] actually tastes good I just love
[4245.72 - 4249.68] it love it love it love it and you guys
[4248.00 - 4254.04] know you guys know I endorse this
[4249.68 - 4257.08] company and I'm proud of it proud of it
[4254.04 - 4259.20] and then some because you know I could
[4257.08 - 4260.40] go to bed at night knowing I'm endorsing
[4259.20 - 4262.52] company that puts out the best stuff
[4260.40 - 4264.48] that's ever been out
[4262.52 - 4265.80] there and you know what you know what's
[4264.48 - 4267.32] crazy it's like companies now what
[4265.80 - 4269.04] they're doing is they're trying to like
[4267.32 - 4271.84] they're trying to catch up the
[4269.04 - 4275.04] vimergy and but nobody knows their dirty
[4271.84 - 4277.84] past citric acid natural
[4275.04 - 4279.52] flavors all the different you kagene in
[4277.84 - 4282.56] all the different
[4279.52 - 4285.28] stuff right
[4282.56 - 4287.40] um Alto Jack Tren like all this
[4285.28 - 4289.04] different stuff in there alcohol all
[4287.40 - 4292.00] this crap in there and all those you
[4289.04 - 4292.96] guys have no idea maybe you do oh I
[4292.00 - 4295.92] stand and
[4292.96 - 4297.52] corrected I'm really sorry maybe you
[4295.92 - 4299.04] guys do know this that all the
[4297.52 - 4300.08] supplements with all the junk and
[4299.04 - 4302.88] garbage in
[4300.08 - 4304.84] it like all these years the stuff that's
[4302.88 - 4306.92] been in there well the companies they
[4304.84 - 4308.48] have to kind of morph they chameleon and
[4306.92 - 4309.84] they they look at what vimer is doing
[4308.48 - 4311.40] and then they start kicking out kicking
[4309.84 - 4312.80] away the citric acid and they make it
[4311.40 - 4314.28] look like that they've always been like
[4312.80 - 4316.00] that and nobody knows the person who
[4314.28 - 4317.60] goes and buys their product doesn't know
[4316.00 - 4319.32] that they had this in there last year
[4317.60 - 4323.04] and this in here 5 years ago and this in
[4319.32 - 4324.40] here they got a dirty nasty gnarly past
[4323.04 - 4326.16] and they have it in their
[4324.40 - 4328.00] supplementations in their supplement
[4326.16 - 4330.20] companies and what happens is nobody
[4328.00 - 4331.56] realizes this and so they try to make
[4330.20 - 4332.96] themselves look squeaky clean now but
[4331.56 - 4334.68] they're still using glow grade stuff and
[4332.96 - 4335.88] they're like oh we don't use citric acid
[4334.68 - 4337.44] anymore where'd you get that from
[4335.88 - 4339.60] because that's medical medum information
[4337.44 - 4341.48] and citric acid is bad for you that's
[4339.60 - 4343.28] been put in supplements we don't use
[4341.48 - 4344.96] alcohol oh really because guess what all
[4343.28 - 4346.56] the herbalist all the all through these
[4344.96 - 4348.44] years say that you need alcohol in your
[4346.56 - 4350.64] supplements in your in your herbal
[4348.44 - 4352.36] tinctures that's medical meme info that
[4350.64 - 4355.44] there's no alcohol in them anymore oh we
[4352.36 - 4357.08] don't use um this that we don't use this
[4355.44 - 4358.52] it's like really where'd you get that we
[4357.08 - 4361.68] don't use natural flavors well how' you
[4358.52 - 4363.28] learn that because it's mm info huh and
[4361.68 - 4365.88] they what they try to do is they try to
[4363.28 - 4368.04] emanate they try to actually copycat
[4365.88 - 4369.84] like a company like Viki and then nobody
[4368.04 - 4372.04] knows about the dirty past and they
[4369.84 - 4374.48] think they're like so squeaky clean
[4372.04 - 4375.80] clean but if they're not
[4374.48 - 4378.00] link is in the bio link is in the
[4375.80 - 4380.24] description go to Medical medium.com get
[4378.00 - 4382.08] on to my newsletter because I got an
[4380.24 - 4383.80] announcement coming up that's coming up
[4382.08 - 4385.64] pretty soon remember when I told you
[4383.80 - 4387.84] guys there's a chance you might be able
[4385.64 - 4390.92] to to see me and maybe you don't want to
[4387.84 - 4395.80] see me that's fine that's fine believe
[4390.92 - 4400.12] me okay all right and but I'm going to
[4395.80 - 4404.64] try to arrange a book signing in person
[4400.12 - 4406.68] I've never done a book signing ever
[4404.64 - 4408.12] millions of copies sold around the world
[4406.68 - 4410.08] almost in every single country in the
[4408.12 - 4414.24] world the medical medium
[4410.08 - 4417.68] books the number one best-selling book
[4414.24 - 4420.24] series in the world for for health right
[4417.68 - 4422.76] almost a decade later I've never done a
[4420.24 - 4424.84] book signing never did a book signing in
[4422.76 - 4427.84] person I never did an official book
[4424.84 - 4430.36] signing for for my publisher for hey
[4427.84 - 4432.48] house um I never did a big book signing
[4430.36 - 4434.80] for Hay House my publisher I don't even
[4432.48 - 4436.52] talk about my publisher sure I even talk
[4434.80 - 4437.44] I act I mean I just like just whatever
[4436.52 - 4440.76] I'm just
[4437.44 - 4442.48] like I don't even talk about that stuff
[4440.76 - 4444.40] right when do I rarely say I'm a number
[4442.48 - 4446.60] one New York Times a seller I rarely
[4444.40 - 4447.96] ever say that kind of thing because it's
[4446.60 - 4449.60] not important what's important is
[4447.96 - 4451.32] getting people better who are sick
[4449.60 - 4454.08] that's critical that's important the
[4451.32 - 4457.32] point is I'm trying to arrange a
[4454.08 - 4461.48] situation where you bring me your book
[4457.32 - 4464.84] and I will with my own hand sign
[4461.48 - 4469.28] it I'm trying try to arrange that
[4464.84 - 4471.48] situation where yeah where I'm some
[4469.28 - 4473.68] place it's probably going to be only one
[4471.48 - 4475.48] place because I just I can't do I can't
[4473.68 - 4477.96] go around the world gallivanting around
[4475.48 - 4480.52] the world you know eating croissants
[4477.96 - 4482.92] here and having a baguette here and then
[4480.52 - 4486.40] doing a book signing and having an
[4482.92 - 4488.84] Exquisite piece of fish here having a
[4486.40 - 4491.36] beautifully made pizza in Italy here and
[4488.84 - 4494.40] then doing this and then whatever and
[4491.36 - 4495.88] I'm not up my ass like that the point is
[4494.40 - 4499.20] is and I don't eat those things the
[4495.88 - 4501.64] point is is is that sign up to my
[4499.20 - 4504.24] newsletter because I'm going to make an
[4501.64 - 4506.96] announcement at some point where you
[4504.24 - 4509.64] bring me a medical medium
