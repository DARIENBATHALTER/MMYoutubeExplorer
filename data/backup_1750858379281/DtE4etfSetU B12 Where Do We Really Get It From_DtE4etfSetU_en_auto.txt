[126.80 - 129.28] people where

[137.92 - 141.20] this episode you guys
[139.28 - 143.76] i talk about that kind of thing
[141.20 - 146.08] happening is like you you go plant-based
[143.76 - 147.52] i'm a huge supporter plant-based uh
[146.08 - 149.20] movement plant-based diets i'm a
[147.52 - 150.64] supporter of animal-based diets too you
[149.20 - 152.40] know clean animal-based diets too and
[150.64 - 154.72] all that but the point is is that i feel
[152.40 - 156.48] bad for the plant-based and vegan people
[154.72 - 159.04] all these years i feel bad for them
[156.48 - 162.16] because they get attacked with
[159.04 - 164.16] certain tricks why trick or treat okay
[162.16 - 165.84] you don't get it from meat because what
[164.16 - 166.96] happens is they're being told once you

[166.96 - 170.56] okay you wake up in the morning like i'm
[168.64 - 172.08] starting my vegan plant-based diet i got
[170.56 - 173.92] inspired by it

[194.32 - 199.36] at apple podcast the link is in the
[196.84 - 201.52] description apple podcast

[208.88 - 212.24] places other
[210.16 - 214.08] platforms it's not going to be the same

[214.08 - 217.52] and i i get it the uncensored version
[215.60 - 219.12] gets a few people upset
[217.52 - 221.44] i've seen that before out there already
[219.12 - 223.68] where i've seen some people
[221.44 - 225.20] complaining like you know i like it when
[223.68 - 228.00] you're censored because
[225.20 - 229.52] you don't say all this this stuff and i
[228.00 - 231.44] like it kind of like

[235.44 - 238.16] hear that
[236.08 - 239.60] and i understand that i understand that
[238.16 - 240.88] but you know look it's
[239.60 - 242.80] it's tough times right there in the
[240.88 - 244.64] world i was looking for a platform where
[242.80 - 247.76] i could be uncensored on

[285.04 - 288.16] also talk about
[286.16 - 289.52] things just nobody knows that's the
[288.16 - 290.48] whole point all of this is about what
[289.52 - 292.56] people don't know
[290.48 - 294.32] out there and it's really interesting
[292.56 - 295.52] you guys have to hear the episode
[294.32 - 297.60] i'm going to talk about it a little bit
[295.52 - 299.60] more lots to cover about that but first
[297.60 - 302.08] i wanted to remind you guys
[299.60 - 303.76] did you listen to the brain fog episode
[302.08 - 305.84] and did you listen to the neurological
[303.76 - 307.04] symptoms episode
[305.84 - 309.36] those are really important did you
[307.04 - 312.40] listen to the apple cider episode
[309.36 - 315.44] that's another one um
[312.40 - 317.28] so joan says my b12 is off the charts i
[315.44 - 320.48] take beverage b12 every day
[317.28 - 324.80] you know what happens is that um it
[320.48 - 326.96] it's it's best to have it you know high
[324.80 - 328.96] and still do things for it and still be
[326.96 - 330.72] proactive in doing things for it and
[328.96 - 332.96] still take things for it you know i talk
[330.72 - 334.56] to doctors all the time about this and
[332.96 - 336.64] doctors are at a point really good
[334.56 - 337.52] doctors out there now they reach out to
[336.64 - 339.36] me and they want to
[337.52 - 340.96] understand b12 and they want to know
[339.36 - 342.72] what's going on because they don't teach
[340.96 - 344.24] anything like that out there
[342.72 - 346.08] you know it's like i had a doctor tell
[344.24 - 348.88] me the other day that they don't teach
[346.08 - 351.28] that in medical school about b12 and
[348.88 - 352.72] where to get b12 from and if it's active
[351.28 - 356.00] and usable is the b12
[352.72 - 357.92] active is the is the b12 usable and
[356.00 - 359.60] they don't even talk about that like how
[357.92 - 363.12] does b12 work in the body
[359.60 - 364.96] so it's so important um elena says you
[363.12 - 368.96] were just censored a few times
[364.96 - 372.08] ha ha ha ha it's funny uh negan fun
[368.96 - 374.32] hey uh what what hey dr fun
[372.08 - 376.16] incredible you're here uh it's true i
[374.32 - 378.00] see people who are not vegans who have
[376.16 - 381.04] low b12 levels
[378.00 - 383.68] amazing credible so you know
[381.04 - 385.52] um so you see it right in your practice
[383.68 - 386.40] uh amazing doctor right there incredible
[385.52 - 389.12] doctor
[386.40 - 390.00] um just just if anybody wants to know
[389.12 - 392.80] and um
[390.00 - 394.24] you know you've got an amazing doctor
[392.80 - 394.96] right there that knows so much about
[394.24 - 397.36] information
[394.96 - 398.96] that's healing people and you know the
[397.36 - 401.68] whole point is it's like
[398.96 - 402.88] when you go when you when you when
[401.68 - 406.56] you're plant-based
[402.88 - 410.16] the biggest fear is b12
[406.56 - 412.96] you know where's your b12 how
[410.16 - 413.76] am i gonna how am i gonna survive am i
[412.96 - 416.48] gonna live
[413.76 - 418.16] am i gonna get sick is is something
[416.48 - 419.84] terrible gonna happen to me is all my
[418.16 - 421.92] hair gonna fall out is
[419.84 - 423.60] am i gonna get acne now and if i don't
[421.92 - 425.60] like all these questions it's fear and
[423.60 - 427.84] chaos with with vegans and plant-based
[425.60 - 430.80] people and i get it that
[427.84 - 432.72] that you know look i get it's scary to
[430.80 - 433.04] go plant-based for a lot of people and
[432.72 - 434.88] so
[433.04 - 436.96] the confusion's there but there's a
[434.88 - 439.68] massive amount of confusion
[436.96 - 440.24] regarding where we get b12 from our food
[439.68 - 443.04] okay
[440.24 - 443.44] so why would plant-based people be told
[443.04 - 445.12] hey
[443.44 - 446.40] you got you're not going to have any b12
[445.12 - 448.48] you're not going to get any b12 from
[446.40 - 451.76] your food why would they say that well
[448.48 - 452.56] because fruits and the vegetables that
[451.76 - 454.80] people eat
[452.56 - 455.92] right including even leafy greens and
[454.80 - 459.04] herbs you know
[455.92 - 460.16] they don't have b12 in them so where are
[459.04 - 462.56] you going to get it
[460.16 - 463.20] because meat has b12 in that right mint
[462.56 - 465.84] meat
[463.20 - 467.12] chicken has b12 eggs has b12 but don't
[465.84 - 468.56] get too excited because i want to tell
[467.12 - 472.00] you something real quick
[468.56 - 474.24] eggs have b12 and oysters
[472.00 - 475.04] clams don't run out and eat a bunch of
[474.24 - 476.80] oysters now
[475.04 - 479.12] don't run out and eat a bunch of clams
[476.80 - 480.08] now right and you know you just yeah
[479.12 - 483.04] you'll get a lot of
[480.08 - 483.68] toxic heavy metals right so anyway so
[483.04 - 486.80] shrimp
[483.68 - 488.08] has b12 so but the whole point is is
[486.80 - 491.60] that b12
[488.08 - 494.64] is not the b12 that our bodies
[491.60 - 494.96] use or utilize that's the trick right
[494.64 - 497.12] there
[494.96 - 498.16] on its own so if you're an animal
[497.12 - 500.40] protein person
[498.16 - 501.28] right you know and you're like hey
[500.40 - 502.88] you're vegan
[501.28 - 505.60] you're not going to get b12 where are
[502.88 - 508.32] you going to get it or if you're a
[505.60 - 510.48] you know doctor that you know even if
[508.32 - 512.64] even vegan doctors i talked to a vegan
[510.48 - 514.32] doctor last week
[512.64 - 516.16] that connected with me is like look i'm
[514.32 - 518.56] a vegan doctor i'm plant-based doctor
[516.16 - 519.60] my patients are mostly plant-based i
[518.56 - 521.92] take care of
[519.60 - 523.20] you know plant-based patients and all
[521.92 - 525.76] this kind of stuff
[523.20 - 526.88] and even he was like where did we get
[525.76 - 530.24] our b12 i was like
[526.88 - 533.44] huh what where you know
[530.24 - 535.60] and i was telling them well first of all
[533.44 - 537.76] where does a meat eater get their b12
[535.60 - 539.12] and it's like well for meat right
[537.76 - 540.96] you get it from meat you get it from
[539.12 - 543.20] chicken get it from eggs
[540.96 - 544.88] and i'm like no you don't you don't
[543.20 - 547.68] that's why meat eaters
[544.88 - 548.88] are also b12 deficient too so just for
[547.68 - 551.44] the record
[548.88 - 553.36] you know there's the majority of b12
[551.44 - 554.72] deficient people are people who eat
[553.36 - 556.16] animal products and this
[554.72 - 558.00] i'm not against animal products or
[556.16 - 559.76] people eating animal products and if you
[558.00 - 561.44] guys know me by now
[559.76 - 563.04] i'm all about answers and you can plug
[561.44 - 564.64] it into whatever diet belief system you
[563.04 - 566.64] have you guys know how that's how i
[564.64 - 568.08] am like you can plug in this information
[566.64 - 568.88] if you want to eat some meat and that's
[568.08 - 570.32] what you want to do
[568.88 - 571.92] you can plug it in if you want to be
[570.32 - 572.56] plant-based it's just about how do we
[571.92 - 574.64] heal
[572.56 - 576.56] where's the answers what information can
[574.64 - 578.32] i give you so you can heal with what the
[576.56 - 580.32] diet or platform you're on right
[578.32 - 582.32] you guys know that all about me medical
[580.32 - 584.32] medium tools are saving lives around the
[582.32 - 586.64] world that are both meat eaters
[584.32 - 587.92] and obviously plant-based of course
[586.64 - 590.00] right and
[587.92 - 592.24] but anyway the whole point is is like
[590.00 - 594.08] you can you can be low in b12 and be
[592.24 - 597.04] eating meat chicken and eggs
[594.08 - 598.40] and you can also have b12 in your system
[597.04 - 600.16] from eating meat chicken and eggs but
[598.40 - 601.84] that b12
[600.16 - 603.20] doesn't mean it's working for you it
[601.84 - 604.80] doesn't mean it's doing the things it
[603.20 - 606.72] does for you and then we get sick down
[604.80 - 609.28] the road and we start falling apart
[606.72 - 610.64] things start going wrong we get viral we
[609.28 - 613.60] have other issues
[610.64 - 615.04] and then we get in trouble so the b12 is
[613.60 - 618.64] important for us and it's
[615.04 - 620.88] it's you know joan says following
[618.64 - 621.84] um joan says mine is high also so your
[620.88 - 624.88] b12 is also
[621.84 - 626.40] high yeah and you can have high b12 now
[624.88 - 629.28] when you hear the episode
[626.40 - 631.28] you'll understand like word for words
[629.28 - 632.96] you'll hear it you'll understand
[631.28 - 635.04] like what happens when it's high what
[632.96 - 636.88] does that mean is it good is it bad is
[635.04 - 637.44] it working for you is it not working for
[636.88 - 639.44] you
[637.44 - 641.60] so we can't get tricked by that either
[639.44 - 644.24] just because our b12 is high
[641.60 - 645.12] doesn't mean we're utilizing it exactly
[644.24 - 647.52] or utilizing
[645.12 - 649.44] all of it from our food it doesn't mean
[647.52 - 650.48] our food is made it was working for us
[649.44 - 654.72] it's important
[650.48 - 656.32] um so yeah so have you guys heard uh the
[654.72 - 658.00] neurological symptom episode you gotta

[675.92 - 679.12] eachota said b12 was a mind blower i
[678.00 - 680.72] listened twice
[679.12 - 682.24] and then another couple of times to that
[680.72 - 684.64] poem at the end whoa
[682.24 - 685.76] wow that's incredible thanks uchoda
[684.64 - 689.04] amazing amazing
[685.76 - 692.64] so that the deal is here
[689.04 - 693.76] is about making sure that you know how
[692.64 - 695.92] to protect yourself
[693.76 - 698.00] and your family you know you might be
[695.92 - 699.52] somebody that wants to stay plant-based
[698.00 - 701.76] and but yet you're about to leave the
[699.52 - 703.20] plant-based movement because you're told
[701.76 - 704.48] where's your b12
[703.20 - 707.04] you might be somebody that's eating
[704.48 - 709.44] animal proteins but you're low in b12 or
[707.04 - 711.20] even high in b12 but does that mean it's
[709.44 - 712.88] working you're gonna have to
[711.20 - 714.80] listen to the podcast if you can and
[712.88 - 715.60] take a few minutes out from your busy
[714.80 - 717.76] day
[715.60 - 719.28] and listen and so you can learn about
[717.76 - 721.12] that too just because
[719.28 - 722.48] you got you're getting just because when
[721.12 - 723.76] you get a blood test and it says oh your
[722.48 - 726.00] b12 is normal
[723.76 - 726.80] doesn't mean that's the b12 that's
[726.00 - 728.88] actually
[726.80 - 731.36] helping protect you so things don't go
[728.88 - 732.48] wrong like you know skin issues and
[731.36 - 734.24] other issues too
[732.48 - 735.68] and a little bit of depression and all
[734.24 - 737.44] these other stuff because what happens
[735.68 - 739.44] is that b12 is critical for
[737.44 - 740.56] your immune system it's critical for
[739.44 - 742.08] nerve function
[740.56 - 744.00] so if you're up against low-grade
[742.08 - 745.76] viruses like i've always talked about
[744.00 - 747.44] if you're up against you know some
[745.76 - 748.00] epstein-barr if you're up against some
[747.44 - 749.44] strap
[748.00 - 751.52] if you're up against something else the
[749.44 - 753.60] toxic heavy metals or other triggers i
[751.52 - 755.20] talk about or emotional hardships
[753.60 - 757.04] if you're up against some broken trust
[755.20 - 759.36] issues that you know happen and
[757.04 - 760.64] betrayal and you know maybe something
[759.36 - 762.48] else that happened in your life and
[760.64 - 763.44] you're you're struggling emotionally and

[881.60 - 887.36] become and what yeah yeah you know what
[884.96 - 889.68] i was just holding back
[887.36 - 891.52] yeah you guys are just you know you're
[889.68 - 893.84] you're you're seeing the aw
[891.52 - 895.20] that has the light the more of a lighter
[893.84 - 897.68] lighter heart you know
[895.20 - 899.44] um elky says he's always been funny for
[897.68 - 900.32] sure absolutely appreciate your humor
[899.44 - 903.84] hey
[900.32 - 906.40] thanks you're awesome um
[903.84 - 908.00] dr fun the reference range for b12 is
[906.40 - 910.48] also not good
[908.00 - 911.36] so so just looking at the numbers isn't
[910.48 - 913.52] enough
[911.36 - 915.44] the brilliant man brilliant doctor i
[913.52 - 918.56] know you're helping so many people
[915.44 - 921.76] um incredible incredible
[918.56 - 923.60] so when it comes down to b12 it's one of
[921.76 - 924.32] those things that i don't want anyone to
[923.60 - 926.96] overlook
[924.32 - 928.16] it's this is one of those must listen to
[926.96 - 930.72] episodes
[928.16 - 932.24] because does your health matter does
[930.72 - 933.92] your wellness matter does your
[932.24 - 935.44] well-being does your emotional
[933.92 - 938.32] well-being matter
[935.44 - 939.28] and so there's when we're missing the
[938.32 - 942.48] link
[939.28 - 943.36] with b12 and not understanding it we can
[942.48 - 944.72] get really in trouble
[943.36 - 946.40] terry king says your podcasts are

[959.28 - 962.56] podcast i get it
[960.64 - 964.72] when people do podcasts out there it's

[975.36 - 981.36] i wanted to make sure that this was

[985.36 - 988.96] you know information from above healing
[988.00 - 992.64] information
