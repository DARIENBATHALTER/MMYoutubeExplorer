Medical medium.com as well you can do

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,160
that as well too so you guys I'm going

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,360
to make a heavy metal detox smoothie

187
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,520
right now I got a bunch of stuff in

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,520
front of me I got this fresh cilantro

189
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,919
people don't get enough cilantro in them

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,280
they just don't they just don't get

191
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,960
enough cilantro in them fact fact a lot

192
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,360
of people just get a little bit of

193
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,199
cilantro in them here and there

194
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,160
different ways maybe it's on top of a

195
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,039
salad if you're lucky maybe you had a

196
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,199
guacamole and it had a a few sprigs of

197
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,240
leaves of cilantro in the guacamole and

198
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,159
that's how you had it a lot of people

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,520
don't eat a lot of cilantro but that is

200
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:59,080
a leafy herb green and in medical medium

201
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,400
information going all the way back that

202
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,039
is powerful that alone is a healing tool

203
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,520
people do not understand can't be

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,960
measured people don't get it really out

205
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,479
there in the health movement they don't

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
know what that is right there cilantro

207
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,680
oh okay cilantro it's got its health

208
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,800
benefits or whatever it's got you know

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,919
or whatever people talk about but the

210
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,680
difference is right there when you use

211
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,599
it like in the hmds and you use like a

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,120
cup of it the something else happens the

213
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,680
nutrient profile the phytochemical

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,120
compounds all of it that's involved in

215
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,560
cilantro alone is powerful so when you

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,519
actually have it as a leafy green herb

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,080
boom that is powerful right there for

218
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,959
your health leafy green herb and it's

219
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,880
powerful okay and so that's the cilantro

220
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,680
that's going to go in here too then you

221
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,720
got the Wyman's wild blueberries right

222
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,120
you guys know I work with Wyman's that's

223
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,279
an incredible wild blueberry it's a

224
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,279
trusted Source it's my favorite of all

225
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,800
in the wild blueberry world so there it

226
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,279
is right there got the Frozen wild

227
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,200
blueberries that's in there I happen to

228
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,240
have a mango here I don't have any

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,279
bananas on hand but a lot of people they

230
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,320
don't use bananas in their hmds they'll

231
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,079
use something like some papaya I talked

232
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,720
about Alternatives in the medical medium

233
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,920
books they'll use some papaya they'll

234
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,760
use some mango they'll do that and

235
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,160
they'll put mango in there which is fine

236
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,320
and that's what I have right here I have

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,240
mango because remember the five

238
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,560
ingredients are the key the cilantro the

239
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,399
barleygrass juice powder barleygrass

240
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
juice powder right the wild blueberries

241
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
that's the other one right there the

242
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,040
sparina that's the other one and the DOL

243
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,160
so that's the key so whether you put it

244
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,480
into like a smoothie bowl like a lot of

245
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,880
people in the medical meme Community

246
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
have done you know and I've talked about

247
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
in the books unless you put it in like a

248
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,000
smoothie bowl or you make a smoothie out

249
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,959
of it or you eat them throughout the day

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,800
you're having your do like I got a

251
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,000
friend that takes the the vimer do

252
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,399
liquid and they take the vimer Dos

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
liquid they take it like that it's like

254
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,040
a supplement they take it it's not even

255
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
in their smoothie and then they're

256
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,519
having cilantro and something else

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,480
you're eating they'll have a whole bunch

258
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
of cilantro then they'll do like

259
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,640
spirulina and they'll mix it with

260
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,120
coconut water and then they'll do this

261
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,920
throughout the day but they'll get their

262
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,000
five key ingredients key ingredients

263
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,800
that are critical that's the whole point

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,160
with the hmds

265
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,760
and so however you dress it up like you

266
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,519
put banana in here you put you know

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,480
something else mango you have mango you

268
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,680

Chrissy said I was in Culver City but

446
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,880
joined the line too late to get my book

448
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,559
but we'll have to skip out oh my

449
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,720
god

450
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,159
oh yeah I mean it was like I said I

451
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,000
think the official count is is is over

452
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,120
20,000 I don't think that's going to

453
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,120
happen look I don't think that's going

454
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,400
to happen here this is not this

455
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,640
September 7th is not an event I'm going

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,080
to do a meet and greet I'm going to be

457
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,679

00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,320
know definitely meet you right that's

460
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,880
what's going to happen there um but I

461
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,000
don't think it's going to be anything

462
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,400
like we're looking like 15 20,000 people

463
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,440
or more Amanda doesn't surprise me I

464
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,559
went to a concert at a stadium that

465
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,679
holds 25k and I looked and I thought

466
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,440
that looks like about the same amount of

467
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,840
people as were at the mm event well it's

468
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,159
really funny because there was one guy

469
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,679
there that's like he he does security

470
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,240
for concerts and stuff like that and he

471
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,960
said there were 30,000 people there I

472
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,080
said it can't be 30,000 he said there's

473
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,200
30,000 people here I do security for

474
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,679
concerts and the whole bed he said this

475
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,480
is this is close to 30,000 so that's

476
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,280
what that's what um it is professional

477
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,840
the security professional who is there

478
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,799
who does concerts pretty much only and

479
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,039
that's what he was saying from what he

480
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,360
can see and tell so he was saying no

481
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,400
there's he said aw there's 30,000 people

482
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
here I'm just going to tell you my

483
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,360
professional opinion from what I see I

484
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
said well we still don't know the

485
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,520
official number and that was happening

486
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,600
that day like that and then we're

487
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,440
hearing that it it it was definitely

488
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,760
most likely over 20 so

489
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:16,360
yeah okay all right what else where am

490
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,200
I I'm in orang land right

491
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,799
here I don't know why I have to throw

492
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,440
throw it in the air like I do but I do

493
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,880
so I'm going to pop some orange in here

494
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,720
this is so

495
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,880
great okay

496
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,640
all right it was so well organized it

497
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,760
felt like a spiritual event it was it

498
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,760
was

499
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,080
Supernatural nothing can explain it

500
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,760
otherwise I'm just going to be straight

501
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,960
with you guys like I always am and I'm

502
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,320
just going to tell you one thing right

503
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,200
now it was it was Supernatural is what

504
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,440
it was I was able to knock out a bunch

505
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,919
of light blasts right and and that that

506
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,080
alone was was incredible at the moment

507
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,400
but it was Supernatural

508
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,880
there was an energy and a light over the

509
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,760
entire

510
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,280
event separate from the light blast of

511
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,520
the light coming down hitting everybody

512
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,400
in the crown of their head and we

513
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,520
separate from that there was a light

514
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,440
that was

515
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:21,080
just over the entire entire V like a

516
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,600
like a bubble like a light bubble it's

517
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,679
just crazy how incredible all of it was

518
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,440
and you felt it

519
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,880
too so yeah

520
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,520
so I'm getting some orange in here I put

521
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,440
a little bit more orange in here this is

522
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,440

you're seasoned you know better that

596
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,679
that's that's just not what it is and I

597
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,200
want to talk about water more I think

598
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,559
it's important in

599
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,880
hydration now I obviously I talk about

600
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,240
it in the liver book boom it's right

601
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,840
over there I don't know if you see that

602
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm not grabbing it right here for IG or

603
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,320
anything but the liver book Liver Rescue

604
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,520
hydration is important people get thick

605
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
dirty blood syndrome is what they do

606
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,720
their blood's thick it's dirty it's

607
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,760
gnarly it's filled with a lot of poisons

608
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,360
and toxins

609
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,159
and can even gel up and get into the

610
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,960
heart valves and everything like that it

611
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,399
can get into all the different n valves

612
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,240
it can gel up and so what happens is

613
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:44,760
that their their blood gets so thick and

614
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,200
toxic okay I've talked about hydration

615
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,720
for years it's amazing how it's like oh

616
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,279
it's supposed to be this quick fix for

617
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,960
everybody with chronic illness everybody

618
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,679
looks like an expert every newbie that

619
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,039
comes in on the scene that is trying to

620
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,440
teach people or whatever and they're

621
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,240

622
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,720
water thing and I'm just like uh don't

623
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,039

624
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,279

625
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,440

626
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,840

they're doing these good things for them

630
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,279

631
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,960
water machine stuff and they don't

632
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,360
realize that anything they're doing good

633
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,760

743
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679

one and it was just straight garbage no

764
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,840
alcohol in it but it had the worst kind

765
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,480
of Glycerin in it the worst of the worst

766
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,760
of the worst I opened up another one

do it was just terrible junk and garbage

771
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,480
and that's why I work with vimergy

772
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,519
that's why I endorse that them like I do

773
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,480
because it's a it's a world away from

774
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,159
that it's a world away from the tricks

775
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,559
and the games and the crap and the

776
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,880
garbage out there this is important it's

777
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,240
a world away from all the tricks and the

778
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,679
games and the garbage out there I can't

779
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,600
say it enough you guys it's not a

780
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,320
joke it's unbelievable on what's out

781
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,399
there here I am I need an herb vimer

782
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,440

783
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:57,240
and have to find it somewhere I'm buying

784
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,799
what I think is the best options you can

785
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,639
find out there

786
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,919
I'm looking everywhere I'm ordering each

787
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,919
one alcohol in that one Al who knows

788
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,880
what kind of alcohol in there alcohol in

789
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,840
this one alcohol in that one oh this one

790
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,279
doesn't have alcohol but it's just

791
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,840
straight garbage it's got something else

792
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,519
in there or it's just junk all on its

793
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,799
own or it's got a bad glycerin it's like

794
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,880
here's one that's alcohol-free maybe

795
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,000
they did the herb right in this one and

796
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,799
then the glycerin was just terrible

797
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,760
terrible glycerin so I'm thinking oh my

798
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,200
God like what kind of or it is that what

799
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,120
are they even using and they're like oh

800
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,399
I know what it is and see the whole

801
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,480
point is that that's the difference

802
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:40,960
right there so when I when I get vimergy

803
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,399
that that's what I mean that's what

804
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,200
you're getting with vimergy you're

805
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,519
getting away from that it's a world

806
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,080
apart from that this is important I'm

807
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,200
making the heavy metal detox smoothie I

808
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,159
saw somebody said what are we talking

809
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,000
about I'm making the hmds right here I

810
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,279
got all my stuff out here but I'm

811
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,600
talking about like something that's

812
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,919
really important because I just had to

813
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,399
seek out another herb that vimergy does

814
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,200
not stock and they do not they do not

815
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:08,679
stock at all and I had to go get it and

816
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,399
it was terrifying in my opinion it had

817
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,360
some form of Al couple of them had some

818
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,519
forms of alcohol in it who knows what

819
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,919
and nobody knows and it was alcohol-free

820
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,720
what was it even doing in there and then

821
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,919
the other stuff too I was just talking

822
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,159
about as well which was the glycerin

823
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,360
terrible glycerin just it's I just want

824
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,519
to say that I I like I

825
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,200
appreciate vimergy for what they've done

826
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,120
I don't care what anybody thinks of me

827
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,279
oh he just works with them or something

828
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,360
I don't care what anybody says and

829
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,639
remember I don't own vimergy I don't own

830
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,440
stocks shares I don't own any percentage

831
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:46,360
of the company I'm not an owner of the

832
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,360
company on any

833
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,799
level very important to know because I

834
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,399
know there's lies out there left and

835
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,120
right about that but the point is is

836
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:57,840
that I back these

837
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,080
guys I I support them and back them

838
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,159
endorse them because of what they have

839
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,760
done and still do and it can't be

840
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,159
matched and you kind of forget about it

841
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,520
because I haven't been taking anything

842
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,440
personally or having a family member

843
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,280
take anything personally that that

844
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,399
they're taking that's outside of the viy

845
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,679
supplements and this is the first time

846
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,280
in a long time and it was like wakeup

847
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,960
call man it was like wakeup call

848
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,720
unfreaking believable it was a wakeup

849
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,720
call so when I had to go outside of the

850
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,079
BG's protective bubble outside of their

851
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,839
unbelievable incredible Angelic products

852
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,119
when I had to go outside of that and

853
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:44,440
then get an herb I was up against the

854
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,040
wild west of crap alcohol nobody knows

855
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,359
what kind of alcohol it says alcohol

856
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,639
free but it was loaded in there no one

857
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
would ever know and there are brands

858
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,440
that you would you probably somebody

859
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,359
probably uses that are just watching

860
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,119
this right now and then other other

861
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,520
brands have the terrifying bad glycerin

862
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,920
in there it's like why West out there

863
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,280
and it's like I just wanted to just be

864
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,680
like okay I I I just wish I didn't need

865
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,800
that herb for somebody I just wish I

866
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,119
could push that away and go back into

867
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,920
the vimergy bubble of safety of how

868
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,599
incredible the stuff is but minute

869
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,240
you're pushed out of it a little bit and

870
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,720
it got pushed out of it to go it's just

871
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,720
it's just

872
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,800
unbelievable anyway so important to know

873
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,920
so that's the DOL right there and adul

874
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,480
liquid just yeah mind blowing all on its

875
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,160
own

876
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,119
but I'm still seeing every day out there

877
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,119
just all the different Malarkey that's

878
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,480
happening in so many different

879
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,240
ways um seriously all the different

880
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,480
things that are happening out there like

881
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,640
I still see people using the alkine

882
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,640
ionizer water machines I still see them

883
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,079
doing that if they only knew what is

884
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,960
happening with that they just wouldn't

885
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,359
even believe it it's just it's just

886
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,040
awful this is barley grass juice powder

887
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,280
by the way going in the each MDS that's

888
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,760
barley grass juice powder that's the

889
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:07,000
vimer G1 V is in Victor i m e RG y right

890
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,920
there okay not barly grass a big mistake

891
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,960
with the hmds and I see it out there all

892
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,560
the time is when they do the mm hmds

893
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,520
that what they do is they put barley

894
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,079
grass in that scratchy stuff right

895
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,880
basically it's like horse grass right

896
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,280
it's like it's like coming off of a farm

897
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,079
field sitting there rolled up in a ball

898
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,880
like a baale of hay you know you know

899
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,599
they're using that and then it's all

900
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,520
pulverized down and crushed down and

901
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,960
it's putting canisters and you'll see

902
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,720
there's canisters out there there's

903
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,520
green caners out there with different

904
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Greens in it and it's like barley grass

905
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,359
not barley grass juice powder yeah and

906
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,000
that that's that's a problem especially

907
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,680
if you have intestinal track issues and

908
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,200
stuff but that's the juice powder right

909
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,319
there I'm going to put the vimergy wild

910
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,200
blueberry now what you'll notice right

911
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,720
here this this is mind-blowing right

912
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
here I got to show you this okay all

913
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,200
right so I'm going to put this in front

914
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,839
of you right there take a look okay let

915
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,640
me just get a utensil so I want you guys

916
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,280
to see this okay

917
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,040
right see what I have to do in here with

918
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,880
this see

919
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,440
this do you know why I have to do that

920
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,920
because it's the first of its kind that

921
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,800
doesn't have the anti- binder agents in

922
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,079
it all your powders out there all your

923
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,200
stuff out there has the antibinding

924
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,640
agents in it you you like the taste of

925
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,839
that binder that they use the anti-

926
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,760
binder agents exactly anti-caking agents

927
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,920
there's none in here so what I'm doing

928
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,359
is I'm breaking up the wild blueberry

929
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,480
powder the reason why it's in that it's

930
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:45,640
doing that people don't know is because

931
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,400
of the quality it doesn't have the

932
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,960
anti-caking agents because that's what

933
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,319
people are actually eating every day

934
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,079
what are they

935
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:58,000
corn things like that starch of some

936
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,560
bizarre type of starch

937
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,280
all kinds of different

938
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,640
stuff who knows what if there's talc in

939
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,000
there in people's stuff what if there's

940
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,440
talc in there how about that to keep it

941
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,480
from like caking Anyway here goes the

942
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,640
spirina right

943
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,599
here okay spirulin there are differences

944
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,800
with with qualities of Spirulina when

945
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,839
you see spirulina and all these

946
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,520
different products out there plan on it

947
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,839
being the junk just just to so people

948
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,920
can make money and save save wherever

949
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,599
they can remember uses the top tier

950
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,359
stuff so that's the spirina no

951
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,280
anti-caking agent so anyway that's going

952
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:38,720
in the

953
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,520

yeah all

996
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,680
right so someone asked to link the

997
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
products is what happened so I'm going

998
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,839
to figure that out for you guys all

999
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,800
right so I just made this it's in here

1000
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,800
um all right I want to about a couple

1001
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,920
other cool things too about everything

1002
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,359
so listen to this right here so the back

1003
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,920
to the water thing I was talking about

1004
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,359
earlier about hydration and stuff I

1005
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,680
think anybody who seasoned and been

1006
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,160
there and done that they know that just

1007
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,839
drinking a ton of water isn't going to

1008
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,240
fix their neurological problems you

1009
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:13,800
don't want to be dehydrated you want to

1010
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,520
drink a little bit of water I'm going to

1011
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,240
go into a whole talk about that as we go

1012
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,040
along as

1013
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,480
well um as we go along in the future

1014
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,119
because I want to do some water talks I

1015
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,560
think that's going to be a good thing

1016
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,839
for a lot of people a lot of people

1017
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,839
don't know how much water should they

1018
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,760
drain

1019
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,359
how much water they shouldn't drink what

1020
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,760
are you doing are youing coconut water

1021
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,359
are you drinking other things are you

1022
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,400
drinking celery juice are you drinking

1023
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,680
the hmds every single day all those

1024
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,599
things add into the equation so I want

1025
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,560
to do an in-depth talk about water and

1026
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,040
water drinking because I've seen people

1027
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,319
out there drink too much water while

1028
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,520
they're doing all this other stuff and

1029
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,079
I've seen people not drink enough water

1030
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,040
too at the same time out there but the

1031
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:59,960
bottom line is is the water trick all in

1032
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,400
its own to to heal people is a mirage

1033
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,839
all on its own yeah of course if you're

1034
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,400
severely dehydrated and you're not

1035
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,400
drinking anything then you better get

1036
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,040
some water but but the bottom line is

1037
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,720
and yeah it's going to help but what I'm

1038
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,319
talking about is everyday chronic

1039
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,560
illness people who are suffering with so

1040
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,680
many symptoms and conditions water

1041
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,800
doesn't fix it it just doesn't fix it

1042
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,200
but get out there you'll hear every day

1043
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,640
from professionals on social media

1044
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,800
they'll be like drink water it's the

1045
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,440
first thing you need to do and it makes

1046
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,200
you feel like well confident like whoa I

1047
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,240
think I have a way to get better now

1048
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,760
just drink a lot of water then they end

1049
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,040
up drinking too much water and they

1050
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,559
dilute their electrolytes they're

1051
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,559
diluting

1052
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,119
everything and that's another whole

1053
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,680
problem all on its own so I want to talk

1054
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,839
about that to you guys anyway I just

1055
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,160
made the hmds I like having it with a

1056
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:48,960
spoon sometimes not just drinking it

1057
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,079
like this but with a spoon if you guys

1058
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,480

1059
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,920

1068
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:17,800
different um and I don't do in-person

is important to know when have I done

1071
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,480
inperson event so it's not like this is

1072
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,680
something where you know this is

1073
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,960
something that's normal it's it's still

1074
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,200
not normal unless I start doing more

1075
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,760
stuff but it's still not normal

1076
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,440
definitely not anyway I wanted to let

1077
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,200

1078
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,040
