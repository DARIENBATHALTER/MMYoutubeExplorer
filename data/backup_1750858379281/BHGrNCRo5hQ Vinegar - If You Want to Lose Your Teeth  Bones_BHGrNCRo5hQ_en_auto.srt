159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,360
does from the inside

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
out you might be something like let me

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
because that's how it works too you see

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
a straw into that

177
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
into that apple cider vinegar and and

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919

i've gone against the industry

323
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,519
right because there's a secret code in

324
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
the alternative medicine industry you

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
guys don't know this

326
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
if there's anything to take out of this

327
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,079
take this from from everything okay

328
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
there's a secret code in the alternative

329
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,639
medicine industry it's

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,880
once you get in there as somebody as an

331
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
authority right a health authority

332
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,639

grenade you're

483
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,760
like something inside of me just wants

484
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,440
me to pull this pin out of the grenade

485
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880

486
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
this pin out of the grenade and hold the

487
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
grenade

488
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,919
hold it close to myself and pull the pin

489
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,039
out and i could be running full speed

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
dive onto you try to stop you from

491
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,400
pulling the pin out

492
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,120
but you're going to pull the pin out

493
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
it's not your fault this is not your

494
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
fault what about kombucha so we'll go

495
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
into that a little bit too we're going

496
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,799
to cover kombucha with fermented foods

497
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,799
just so you know

498
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
so here's a question right here on tick

499
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,600
tock is vinegar

500
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
apple cider vinegar mixed with water

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,520
good

502
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,000
for a toner no terrible doesn't tone

503
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
anything

504
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,200
terrible apple cider vinegar surfaces is

505
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,240
good you want to have it in a health

506
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
care product it's

507
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,000
on a surface shampoo or something is

508
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
fine

509
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,400
calcium and minerals from bones

510
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:30,320
are removed with vinegar

511
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:34,000
because the acidic acid is so acidic

512
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,559
it creates a response

513
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,520
in the body and that response in the

514
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,919
body is to dump

515
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
calcium dump calcium your bones just

516
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
dump calcium dump calcium that's what

517
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,679
your bones do it's like

518
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
let's just dump the calcium in you put a

519
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,480
little vinegar i don't care if it's the

520
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,160
best apple cider vinegar you

521
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,400
i don't care if grandma has her own tree

522
00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:00,000
okay and our grandpa has his own treat

523
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
and he picked the apples himself

524
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
and you made that vinegar out of those

525
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,160
apples

526
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,200
when you do the vinegar you lose your

527
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,039
bones

528
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,760
because the calcium leeches out because

529
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,120
it has to acetic acid

530
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,760
it's a threat to the body the body's

531
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:24,480
under siege it's under siege

532
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:28,160
right nikki mickey fox on tick tock says

533
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,559
i regret all the kombucha i ever had

534
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480

acid because it's under siege

536
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,840

563
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,679
and we're not so sick or we're not sick

564
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
yet

565
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,200
we feel indestructible

566
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,880
we feel indestructible to do a lot of

567
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
bad things

568
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,840

570
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,480

talk about that now let's go into that

652
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
right now

653
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,600

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,640
you know it's the stomach

656
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,919
can improve temporarily for

657
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,760
some that are using apple cider vinegar

658
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
so that means like an acid reflux or

659
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,159
something like that okay

660
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,120
not for all but for some so let's go

661
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
into that a little bit

662
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
and keep in mind keep in mind on this

663
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
one okay

664
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,039
i'm actually attacked by the apple cider

665
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
vinegar

666
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,679
propagandists i'm not auction i'm

667
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
actually watched

668
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,880
by the industries in the alternative

669
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,200
health movement

670
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
they watch everything i do they have

671
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,679
scouts go on every live

672
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,200
to see what i'm ripping apart if i'm

673
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,960
ripping apart matcha tea they'll have

674
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
scout say how much he's doing so you're

675
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,240
doing so much for them keep that in mind

676
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,919
i'm not saying everyone

677
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,520
but a couple of those are going to slip

678
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,760
in they always do

679
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,880
they're advocating for their paid to

680
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,360
advocate for

681
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,840
all the different stuff that i rip apart

682
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,120
that's how it's done

683
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
keep that in mind right there

684
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,240
so let's go into this a little bit

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,279
so here's how it works your stomach

686
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:12,559
has little glands in there

687
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,559
those little glands produce your hcl

688
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,760
right we weaken the glands

689
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,520
throughout the years through caffeine

690
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,520
practices

691
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,880
bad food processed food practices okay

692
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,159
alcohol practices right and vinegar

693
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,279
practices

694
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:39,200
we weaken those stomach glands

695
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:43,200
but if you do shots of vinegar

696
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,279
you can spike your

697
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,480
stomach glands into dumping out

698
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:54,159
a lot of hydrochloric acid

699
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,960
it's temporary temporary it doesn't work

700
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,480
for long

701
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
it might work for somebody for a month

702
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,120
it might work for somebody for six

703
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
months might work for somebody for a

704
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,640
year and then

705
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,679
you trashed your stomach lambs worse

706
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,720
than ever

707
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,919
before ever

708
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,760
before acv burned my stomach so bad i

709
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,120
wanted to cry

710
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,320
steph grace on tick tock said that

711
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,480
so should i not listen to any of the

712
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,640
the people who have a negative

713
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,000
experience with episode of anger

714
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
should i just ignore all those and just

715
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
stay focused on the the people that are

716
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,080
popping up saying it helped my stomach

717
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
or helped my whatever so let's just

718
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,919
ignore the people that say hey it ruined

719
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,080
my bones hey it ruined my teeth

720
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,120
you know ruined my stomach hurt my

721
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
stomach

722
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,840
hurt my intestinal tract should i just

723
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,640
ignore all those

724
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,000
so let's go into this a little bit back

725
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
this if you're really sick

726
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,360
and you consume vinegar on a regular

727
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,720
basis you're not gonna heal

728
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,120
you're not you're not going to take it

729
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,600
to the finish line anyway

730
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,960
it's critical to know right there so

731
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,919
it's something you might want to stay

732
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,400
away from

733
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,720
right so we trash our stomach lands

734
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
throughout our life we don't do it on

735
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,919
purpose

736
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
we do with the fast foods the processed

737
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
foods we do with the high fats the high

738
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,200
fats you guys

739
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,840
fat fat fat fat we do vinegars

740
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,399
right margaret hurst says

741
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,120
i fell for it too claiming to cure

742
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
arthritis

743
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,520
big joke it really is but there's a

744
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,360
tremendous amount of money invested into

745
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,760
apple cider vinegar right now

746
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,399
tremendous amounts you guys have to see

747
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
the signs

748
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,520
and when there's a lot of money invested

749
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,720
in something to have

750
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,880
countless people fighting for it

751
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,440
because they're on the payroll it's just

752
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,039
unbelievable really

753
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,320
casey and there's people that honestly

754
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,679
think it is helping them in the moment

755
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
but don't don't realize what it's going

756
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,240
to do to them later on

757
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,320
casey shellman says they used to have

758
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,360
gastroparesis and was told to do apple

759
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
cider vinegar

760
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
every day and my digestion was still

761
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,960
slow

762
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,399
and burned when i drank it medical

763
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,600
medium information finally helped my

764
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,080
digestion

765
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,919
celery juice is what helped me so much

766
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,679
in following mm protocols

767
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,120
from the books we tear up our stomach

768
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,159
lands they're inside our stomach

769
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,440
okay we tear them up we destroy them we

770
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,360
weaken them

771
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,120
and then we get told to do the apple

772
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,640
cider vinegar and we spike what's left

773
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,440
of them

774
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,360
we drain blood from a stone

775
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
because we spike what's left of those

776
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,679
stomach lands in there

777
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,520
what we're spiking is we're causing the

778
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,480
stomach glands to squeeze out every last

779
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,039
little tiny

780
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,799
molecule of hcl to try to give us a

781
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,880
temporary fix and we don't realize it

782
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,480
because someone made a huge mistake

783
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
thinking that that stuff was medicine

784
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,840
and then they bankroll on it so no one's

785
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,960
going to break that whole process out

786
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,640
there

787
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,440
just me doing a live about this

788
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,760
always comes with some razor burns

789
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,200
because i'll be hearing it later on

790
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,320
because i'm hurt in the industry's

791
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
pocket when it comes down to acv

792
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
different if i didn't have as much

793
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,840
influence didn't have

794
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,200
seven new york times uh best-selling

795
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,799
books out there in the world

796
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,480
didn't have books published in almost

797
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,559
every single country in the world wasn't

798
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,120
the number one best-selling author in

799
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,320
health

800
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,240
running six plus years if all that

801
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,399
wasn't happening

802
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,520
then i think they wouldn't care no one

803
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,120
would care

804
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
but when you have all that and you start

805
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,080
going into all this stuff and tearing

806
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,799
this stuff because i gotta have your

807
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,559
backs

808
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,559
boy am i going to get the razor burn

809
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,520
later

810
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,520
so what happens is

811
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,120
your hcl gets burnt out finally and

812
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
tapped out inside your stomach

813
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,240
so let's go into a couple other things

814
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,360
that occurs when that happens when you

815
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,960
lose your

816
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,919
when you lose um kimberly miller that's

817
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,760
what ac did for me in 2016

818
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,720
i was on my death bed and not digesting

819
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,440
anything my naturopath said to drink

820
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,240
aloe and acv together aloe was a smart

821
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,559
move

822
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
and it helped my digestion at the time

823
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,919
and i kept drinking it for years

824
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,520
thinking it was good

825
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,320
my teeth started falling apart at once

826
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,559
a few years ago and it was so scary

827
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,960
that's how it works i got sick again in

828
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,399
in 2018

829
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,399
and my hcl was shot i've been doing your

830
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,640
protocols for two years now

831
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,320
and haven't had any more teeth issues

832
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,720
they actually feel healthier

833
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,399
than ever before i've had teeth issues

834
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
since childhood anyways

835
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,840
what happens is especially if you've had

836
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,279
t kimberly if you've had teeth issues

837
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,120
going back then the opposite of fingers

838
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,559
really going to do a number

839
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,320
and that's what happens we go along we

840
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,919
go along we go along we go along

841
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,960
and then all of a sudden they just all

842
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,760
start falling apart from the vinegar

843
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,679
and that's how it's done aloe was a good

844
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,519
recommendation good thing i spent 35

845
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,320
years teaching about aloe so naturopaths

846
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,320
can recommend it

847
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,200
jennifer i lived off of apple cider

848
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,240
vinegar for about a year

849
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,440
i felt awake and well

850
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,399
until i felt and looked like death it's

851
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,960
bad

852
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,960
it's bad it's bad

853
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,799
so what is what does vinegar do to us

854
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,559
besides everything we're talking about

855
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,600
another one healthily

856
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,000

cj and reducing fats was the was the way

860
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,039

apple cider vinegar pickles organs

881
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
the liver is the organ it likes the

882
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,679
pickle it pickles all

883
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,640
organs it'll pickle the brain get ready

884
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,720
for this you guys

885
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
you guys i still have to to create some

886
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,320
food for you guys and i know that so

887
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,880
hang in there for the ride on that

888
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,600
here's how organs get pickled okay

889
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,960
vinegar including apple cider vinegar

890
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,000
sucks the fluid

891
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,640
out of your cells

892
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,159
it doesn't detox the fluid

893
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:04,399
it leaves behind the toxin

894
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:07,600
so you can't detox the toxin anymore

895
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,720
vinegar including apple cider vinegar

896
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,279
removes the hydration

897
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,760
in a cell but doesn't remove

898
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:23,440
the poison in a cell critical to know

899
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,000
get ready for this how do you create a

900
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,039
pickle

901
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,480
do you guys know what's how do you

902
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,600
create a pickle

903
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,399
a lot of salt need a lot of salt

904
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,320
a lot of vinegar a lot of vinegar a

905
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,840
little bit of water

906
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,840
right create a pickle

907
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,200
we have salt in our blood we have

908
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,480
the mineral sodium in our blood

909
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,919
sodium is a mineral we have

910
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,679
in our organs and in our blood

911
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:01,919
okay when you mix vinegar

912
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:05,279
and salt you can pickle

913
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,879
anything right

914
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,879
when you add vinegar to your body

915
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,919
through your mouth you drink your

916
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,240
vinegar

917
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,240
okay

918
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,720
you drink your vinegar put it on your

919
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,399
food in your salads

920
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,800
that acetic acid is now interacting with

921
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,440
your

922
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
sodium

923
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,879
acetic acid your acv

924
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,440
mixed with sodium creates a chemical

925
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,560
reaction

926
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,320
please remember this that chemical

927
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,359
reaction

928
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,599
is pickling

929
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,720
that means sodium inside your

930
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,800
bloodstream

931
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,000
mixed with the vinegar creates a

932
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,760
chemical reaction

933
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,760
and starts to pickle organs

934
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,040
if you did too much vinegar

935
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,320
you'd be in the er the er

936
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,240
you would literally go into pickling

937
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,040

of healing and we don't want to be sick

971
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,480
but we do want to destroy ourselves we

972
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,320
have something innately in us that just

973
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,079
wants to kill ourselves

974
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,359
that's how we want to poison ourselves

975
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,320

976
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,640

i want to have vinegar in moderation

982
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,960
laura my whole life

983
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
i loved pickles mustard vinegar and

984
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,560
vinegar and everything

985
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,880
now in my 40s my teeth are literally

986
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
dissolving that's when it hits

987
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,720
it's what it hits but i've seen it

988
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,000
hitting in in people's 20s too

989
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,079
i've seen it hit in their 20s because

990
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
the vinegar i've seen people have

991
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,760
a lot of mineral deficiencies they come

992
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,800
here early with teeth that are already

993
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,800
on the rocky road

994
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,720
they could hit in your 70s though you

995
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,839
can have good mineral

996
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,680
minerals from birth from mom for some

997
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,480
reason

998
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,480
mom had a lot of blackberries and a lot

999
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,800
of raspberries and

1000
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
he had some decent minerals transferred

1001
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,280
over

1002
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,079
dad had some blackberries something

1003
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,599
happened

1004
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
you got some minerals transferred over a

1005
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,960
little less mercury chris has said

1006
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,440
there's a youtube

1007
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,599
supplement at right now saying study

1008
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,040
shows acetic acid helps carbohydrate

1009
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,320
digestion

1010
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,359
yeah study shows by acetic acid

1011
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
companies

1012
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,000
that's how it works that's how it's done

1013
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,760
they don't know what happens in your

1014
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
digestion when you dump that stuff in

1015
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
there

1016
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,160
i'm sorry but i'm kind of confused here

1017
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,440
i'm scratching my head a little bit um

1018
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,400
when you dumb apple cider vinegar in

1019
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
your stomach you mean they have a

1020
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,440
machine

1021
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,800
they have a machine that can see where

1022
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,400
that apple cider vinegar is going what

1023
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,760
it's doing and if it's helping or not

1024
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,640
well we have technology that does that

1025
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:07,200
are you kidding me and that's how

1026
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,200
the whole thing's a sham and a scam

1027
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,599
but the more and more you'll find

1028
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,960
that i hurt industries like say apple

1029
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,359
cider vinegar anything else the more and

1030
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
more

1031
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,720
a campaign will come on and more and

1032
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
more another campaign will come on

1033
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,920
they'll dump another

1034
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,119
five million dollars in in a campaign

1035
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,960
and try to get another

1036
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,560
bogus study they'll dump another 10

1037
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,040
million another 20 million

1038
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,280
and like i said the chronically ill will

1039
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
be sitting there waiting for a bone

1040
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
they'll be waiting for an answer they'll

1041
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,720
be waiting for science research to man

1042
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,760
up and actually do something for the

1043
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,200
chronically ill

1044
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
and instead they're just going to be

1045
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,720
instead be all busy they're all busy

1046
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,760
working on apple cider vinegar let's see

1047
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
if there's anything else we could

1048
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
squeeze out

1049
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,839
apple cider vinegar it ruined your teeth

1050
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,839
too i just saw that

1051
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,240
pickling organs is what it does when

1052
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:02,720
it meets your sodium in your bloodstream

1053
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:06,079
that's how it works you guys and

1054
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,720
you know i mean should i care

1055
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,200
yeah i should care like i should i

1056
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,680
should

1057
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,160
i should care sometimes it feels like a

1058
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,800
battle you can't win ever right

1059
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,760
it's a battle you can't win you know you

1060
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,880
want to help people

1061
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,920
but the industry has oh man they're

1062
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,040
tough

1063
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,880
they're tough they got it all sewed up

1064
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,520
and they got a lot of money invested

1065
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,079
and then they need sheep let's talk

1066
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,800
about bacteria

1067
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,640
balancing bacteria in your gut is a

1068
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,960
flawed theory

1069
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,760
balancing bacteria in your gut is a

1070
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,160
flawed

1071
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,280
flawed theory you're doing your kombucha

1072
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
tea you're doing your apple cider

1073
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,720
vinegar with mother you're doing your

1074
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,640
fermented foods and you think

1075
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,839
you're balancing your gut bacteria

1076
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,240
all the bacteria the microorganisms

1077
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,280
that are on fermented food that are in

1078
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,599
yogurt

1079
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,400
that are in fermented food that are in

1080
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,599
kefir

1081
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,640
kombucha tea fermented vegetables

1082
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,680
fermented pastes whatever it is

1083
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,720
in all fermented food that bacteria

1084
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,400
doesn't exist in people's guts did you

1085
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,839
guys know that

1086
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,920
it doesn't it doesn't exist in people's

1087
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,040
guts did you guys know that

1088
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
important to know and what's interesting

1089
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,720
is

1090
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
that bacteria is bacteria that likes to

1091
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,040
be on something that

1092
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,160
died died

1093
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,960
so it likes to be on something that died

1094
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:52,400
when we eat food it comes to life

1095
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:55,760
food comes to life that's what happens

1096
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,520
death is something different when

1097
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,119
a vegetables dying and ferments the

1098
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,000
bacteria and microorganisms on that

1099
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,960
vegetable

1100
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
are on death this concludes the

1101
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
fermented foods i was talking about

1102
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,920
includes vinegar

1103
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,760
and all that now vinegar and fermented

1104
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,839
foods were a survival food back

1105
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,000
thousands of years ago because no one

1106
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,440
had a freezer and a refrigerator and no

1107
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,079
one had whole foods

1108
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,560
trucks driving around going to a whole

1109
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,599
foods

1110
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,319
every single county every single town a

1111
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,240
whole foods

1112
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,640
whole foods grocery stores grocery

1113
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,800
stores health food health food stores

1114
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,400
chain chain stores chain restaurants no

1115
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,280
one had access to that

1116
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,920
you're in the country in china you died

1117
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,319
if you ran

1118
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,319
out of food two three hundred years ago

1119
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,319
you're in the country in china you just

1120
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,359
died you ran out of food

1121
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,280
you ate you ate your family members

1122
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,520
you ate all the livestock you had you

1123
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,119
ate it you eat every single goat

1124
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,880
until they're gone and then if that

1125
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,440
winter isn't over yet and you're still

1126
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,160
hungry

1127
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
you're gonna then eat grandpa because

1128
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,720
that's how it's gonna work you're gonna

1129
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,400
keep your children alive

1130
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,839
and they're gonna knock grandpa out over

1131
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
the head and then

1132
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,520
and then everybody's gonna be eating

1133
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,480
grandpa

1134
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,680
okay they did it here too in the u.s do

1135
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,560
it anywhere

1136
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,359
if you're starving and you have no food

1137
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,760
in a way

1138
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,720
to preserve food throughout the winter

1139
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,319
you would starve to death

1140
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,920
that's how it was done so here's how it

1141
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,560
works

1142
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,240
at the end of the season you take all

1143
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,079
your vegetables uh

1144
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,800
does everybody get in the last harvest

1145
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,960
because it's 20 degrees out now

1146
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,480
and we don't have a freezer we don't

1147
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,240
have a refrigerator because this is

1148
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,359
because it's 20 degrees

1149
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,359
doesn't mean that's going to be your

1150
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,400
freezer that's not how it works a

1151
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079
freezer has to stay a certain

1152
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
temperature long term it can't go up

1153
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,359
down

1154
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,800
up down food just all rots so we don't

1155
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,160
have a refrigerator we don't have a

1156
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
whole foods nearby

1157
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,520
we don't have any kind of we don't have

1158
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
any kind of stores

1159
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,839
we're out in the country and it's the

1160
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,200
year 1608

1161
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,319
and we run out of food by the time it's

1162
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,160
december

1163
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,160
we're going to be eating our horses

1164
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
so they took all their food and they

1165
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,160
dumped it

1166
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,359
in vats they dumped it in vats

1167
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,680
and they let it ferment it was a

1168
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,960
survival tactic you guys

1169
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,319
survival tactics aren't health technique

1170
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,200
tactics survival tactics are to keep you

1171
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,200
alive

1172
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,560
but they're not there to help you when

1173
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
you get chronic illness

1174
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,319
from classified medical research and

1175
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,400
science that gave you epstein-barr

1176
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,240
they give you hhv-6 they give you

1177
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,880
sedimental virus they gave you simplex

1178
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,680
one in a

1179
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,880
dozen other varieties of simplex one

1180
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,359
they gave you simplex two

1181
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,079
the classified medical industry who

1182
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,000
released

1183
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,640
all your epstein bars out in the world

1184
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,839
and all the hhv sixes and hhv7s inside

1185
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,240
of megaloviruses

1186
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,240
all shingles viruses all the different

1187
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,079
the chickenpox viruses

1188
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,599
all those were released by classified

1189
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,240
medical research and science over the

1190
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,280
last 100 years

1191
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,440
and in 1608 nobody was battling that

1192
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,200
so they had to use survival food

1193
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,319
survival food was you either eat

1194
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,119
something and get some kind of

1195
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,560
carbohydrate in you or you die

1196
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,880
so put all your vegetables in a vat

1197
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,240
that's what they did 2000 years ago you

1198
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,920
put in in the east

1199
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,680
you put all your vegetables at the end

1200
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,520
of the year the end of the last harvest

1201
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,480
you put it all in these vats and you let

1202
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,920
it ferment

1203
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,880
you let it ferment lindsey says makes so

1204
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,560
much sense

1205
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,720
lindsay napier thank you for being on

1206
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,720
here

1207
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,200
and you know it's a great name and you

1208
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,400
know it's

1209
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,280
it's it's interesting

1210
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
because so what happened was in order to

1211
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,319
stay alive

1212
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,480
we had to stick it in crock pots without

1213
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,839
cooking it we had to stick in these vast

1214
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,040
massive ceramic pots you guys

1215
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,280
and and that was the pot you go to

1216
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
when you ran out of food so now it's

1217
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,160
january

1218
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,440
somewhere or say it's whatever in the

1219
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,319
opposite end of the world and it's

1220
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,520
whatever

1221
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:14,720
say it's the cold months and now you

1222
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,440
ran out of your horse meat

1223
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,319
or no you ran out of your goat meat you

1224
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,240
ran out of

1225
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,599
whatever livestock you think you could

1226
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,839
have spared

1227
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,960
and now you're going into the crock pot

1228
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,079
you're going you're lifting up the

1229
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,359
ceramic

1230
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,760
smells fermented stinks like heck

1231
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,560
it was salt thrown in there too many

1232
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,720
times they throw

1233
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,000
salt in there there'd be microorganisms

1234
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,839
in there it didn't mean those

1235
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,359
microorganisms gave you life

1236
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,119
they were just microorganisms that

1237
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,640
happen to be undead things but the dead

1238
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,800
things is what you're trying to eat to

1239
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,359
get to survive to get the carbohydrate

1240
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,280
so then you're in that slop and that

1241
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,040
slop is what you're eating

1242
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,119
in order to try to get till march until

1243
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,880
that the tundra starts to cool that you

1244
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,720
know warm up

1245
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,319
and what happens is it was a survival

1246
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,280
tactic bottom line

1247
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,280
and that's what it was

1248
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,760
microorganisms that you think that on

1249
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
your fermented foods are not naturally

1250
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,000
inside your intestinal tract i'm sorry

1251
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,319
to say

1252
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,119
sorry you guys sorry

1253
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,040
and here's another thing too good

1254
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,640
bacteria inside your gut that's

1255
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,200
naturally in there does not

1256
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,680
fight bad bacteria you can't balance out

1257
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,520
your gut by putting in fermented stuff

1258
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,480
fermented stuff doesn't balance out the

1259
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,560
microbiome that's a theory

1260
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,960
and you know it but it doesn't balance

1261
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,640
it out it doesn't control bad bacteria

1262
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,160
you can have all the microorganisms you

1263
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,240
want in fermented food but it doesn't

1264
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,000
control bad bacteria

1265
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,440
it doesn't stop bad bacteria do you know

1266
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,040
they don't fight each other you know

1267
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,400
they don't go against each other

1268
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,119
something that's really important to

1269
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,040
know okay

1270
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,119
bad microorganisms the bad

1271
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,079
microorganisms right you guys

1272
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,520
the bad ones they don't care about the

1273
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,240
good ones

1274
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,000
they don't battle each other they don't

1275
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,040
battle each other

1276
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,040
that's important to know

1277
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,319
and so the idea of balancing your good

1278
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,720
microorganisms

1279
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,640
isn't even an idea that's valuable

1280
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,000
because it's a theory that doesn't work

1281
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,240
it cancels out itself

1282
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,359
because the most simplest understanding

1283
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,800
about our gut

1284
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,480
the most simplest understanding about

1285
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,520
our gut is that

1286
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,880
these two don't play with each other

1287
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,440
good bacteria don't go and try to find

1288
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,640
bad bacteria and push them out

1289
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,559
they don't do anything like that good

1290
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,319
bacteria isn't the stuff that's on your

1291
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,079
fermented foods

1292
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,040
that's not naturally in your gut is your

1293
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,040
good bacteria

1294
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,599
we're so lost we're so lost

1295
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,400
in the world of gut health

1296
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,240
i got a doctor calling right now i

1297
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,440
actually had an appointment

1298
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:04,839
i got a doctor calling right now because

1299
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:07,839
because this doctor wants me to do

1300
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
something

1301
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,559
dr shallow hey you there

1302
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,640
so you want me to do fecal matter

1303
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,760
implants right

1304
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,599
like so you want to so the new thing is

1305
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,880
to make sure that what you're saying is

1306
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,400
if you take

1307
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,839
someone else's right

1308
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,960
and you put that

1309
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,800
up my behind right and you plant it in

1310
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,000
there

1311
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
it's going to help me with my bad

1312
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,079
microorganisms

1313
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,960
but what about the person's poop does

1314
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,040
that have any bad

1315
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,000
microorganisms in it are you guys

1316
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,119
screening that properly

1317
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,680
no you're not it's clean poop so you're

1318
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,319
using

1319
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,680
other people's clean poop you've gave it

1320
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,280
a quick scan

1321
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,280
but what if you guys aren't looking for

1322
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,240
the right stuff with fecal matter in

1323
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,240
plants

1324
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,440
what if you're not looking for the

1325
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,760
shingles viruses

1326
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,960
oh you're not you guys have never even

1327
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,040
heard of looking for that because you

1328
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,720
don't even know what they look like

1329
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,800
wait a minute so fecal matter implant

1330
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,880
is really antiquated already because you

1331
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,200
guys aren't looking for somebody's hv6

1332
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,720
that could be in their poop

1333
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,359
so here you're just sticking fecal

1334
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,720
matter implant material

1335
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,599
up somebody else's butt and there could

1336
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:37,280
be like

1337
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:38,960
hsv 1 hsb2 hh v8 hh

1338
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,720
so but you want me to do it anyway you

1339
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,880
think it's going to help my digestion

1340
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,319
it's going to balance my microflora

1341
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,960
what's with all you guys with your

1342
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,480
microflora

1343
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,880
you guys don't even know why anybody's

1344
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,559
sick you don't even know why people have

1345
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,079
chronic fatigue syndrome

1346
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,079
until medical medium published

1347
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,400
information about it

1348
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,440
but you guys are all experts i i know

1349
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,000
i'm not trying to insult you dr shao

1350
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,920
i'm not i didn't mean to do that you

1351
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,440
want me to try it so you want me to do a

1352
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,079
fecal matter implant because you want me

1353
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,280
to balance my microflora

1354
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,800
all right and but you know that good

1355
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,960
bacteria

1356
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,640
doesn't fight bad bacteria in the gut

1357
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,960
right bad bacteria

1358
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,079
stays there in the gut and does its

1359
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,680
thing no matter what

1360
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:29,440
so i have a better idea what if we just

1361
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,400
learn about killing off our bad bacteria

1362
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,760
how about that you guys don't know

1363
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,640
anything about that

1364
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,119
unless you took medical meme information

1365
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,839
all right

1366
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,839
i'm gonna hang up okay

1367
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,359
microorganisms i'm living things

1368
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,720
if you grow your own dill guys i'm gonna

1369
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,480
make some pickles

1370
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,000
it's a pickled salad not pickles with

1371
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,559
pickled salad you grow your

1372
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,559
own dill

1373
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,160
there's going to be microorganisms on it

1374
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,920
you pick it out of your garden you pick

1375
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,880
it out a little planter you grew right

1376
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,800
on your porch

1377
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,240
you grew it on the windowsill you grew a

1378
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,079
little planter of dill

1379
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,520
you got the microorganisms these are the

1380
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,559
elevated biotics

1381
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,920
that balance out our microflora no one's

1382
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,960
talking about that no one knows they

1383
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,559
exist

1384
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,720
they're worried about what they can make

1385
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,119
in the in in the in the

1386
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,640

yeah i know elevated probiotics are

1411
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,920
small microorganisms that live on living

1412
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,680
foods

1413
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,960
like your sprouts or your dill you grow

1414
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,400
in your garden or something like that

1415
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,839
when you pick it and put in your mouth

1416
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,520
or you pick a blackberry and put it in

1417
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,720
your mouth or you go to a farm where you

1418
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,000
can pick your own food

1419
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
and you pick it and you eat it right

1420
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,800
there right you pick a strawberry and

1421
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,160
you eat it right off the thing when

1422
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,599
you're going to pick some strawberries

1423
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,599
even if you do it once a year

1424
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,440
the microorganisms on those strawberries

1425
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,119
are the ones that go into your gut down

1426
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,119

those microorganisms

1431
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,559

1613
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,599
j

1614
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,040
jenkins says why does lemon juice give

1615
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:03,280
me a sore throat

1616
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,280
and take the skin off my lips

1617
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,839
is it lemon juice fresh from a fresh

1618
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,280
lemon

1619
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,280
it's a lot of lemon juice

1620
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,559
you can buy lemon juice in a little

1621
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,000
squeezy bottles containers that's

1622
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,000
battery acid

1623
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,440
that stuff is battery acid is what that

1624
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,839
is

1625
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,839
number one um

1626
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,119
you know there's like every now and then

1627
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,839
there's that person that gets like a

1628
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:37,359
sore throat from lemon

1629
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:40,000
is it lemon juice on its own

1630
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,559
if it's straight lemon juice it's pretty

1631
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,720
harsh

1632
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,839
because it kills off all the bacteria in

1633
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,040
your mouth

1634
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,559
and when you do a kill off that serious

1635
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,599
you might get a reaction when you use

1636
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,920
something like that it's medicine

1637
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,640
when you're doing lemon juice like like

1638
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,400
if i took

1639
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,559
if i took this lemon and i squeezed half

1640
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,880
this whole lemon straight into my mouth

1641
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,960
that would be sharp because that fruit

1642
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,599
acid is really sharp

1643
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,119
but it's also a bacteria killer if

1644
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,359
you're somebody that has a lot of

1645
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,880

they got e coli in their system

1650
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:22,000
c diff in their system but they have all

1651
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,520
that mouth bacteria

1652
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,680
they're loaded with mouth bacteria and

1653
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,960

and you drop that lemon straight in

1656
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,680

01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,559
could have been the orange

1671
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,160
but it wasn't it was the pizza from last

1672
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,440
friday night and it took a little while

1673
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,920
for the strep to cause an acne blast

1674
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,680
you know we got to kind of like reel it

1675
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,160
in a little bit we got to reel it in a

1676
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,240
little bit

1677
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,359
and just kind of like make sense out of

1678
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,359
it so

1679
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:25,280
okay gets breakouts from eating an

1680
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:28,720
orange uh

1681
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:31,359
okay but never had a breakout before

1682
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,799
so or is it the breakouts come

1683
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,400
constantly they come and go

1684
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,400
one week it's a breakout one week it's

1685
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,760
not one week it's a breakout one week

1686
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,359
it's not had an orange oh it must have

1687
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,559
been the orange one week it's a breakout

1688
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,400
one week it's not

1689
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
think about that right having pizza

1690
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,119
having gluten having cheese having dairy

1691
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,039
having whatever

1692
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,160
uh five days later you get a breakout

1693
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,160
must have been that lemon
