lots of different questions i want to

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,159

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,400

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,079
not sure what i'm making yet

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
not quite sure yesterday i did the

54
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,680
cranberry water i made myself a big

55
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,399
salad all of that so very vegan says

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,439
what should i do for chronic hives

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,200
um so for chronic hives you got to think

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,680
about this okay so

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
why is there is there this reaction in

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
the body

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
what's happening like why is the body

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,680
reacting

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
well what happens with hives is our body

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,240
reacts to a toxin

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,920
a toxin and then we get these hives a

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
result from this toxin

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
and the hives come and go they'll come

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,959
up they'll go down

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
they'll come up they'll go down and what

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
happens is that

71
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
there's a toxin coming from some place

72
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,319
and it comes from the liver

73
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
and so as blood's coming out of your

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,400
liver it's going to take some of that

75
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
toxin and sweep it out of the liver

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,440
send it through your bloodstream send it

77
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,280
to the skin and you're just going to

78
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
react and react and react so what kind

79
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
of toxin

80
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
is it well a lot of little things can do

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
that okay

82
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
so a little bit of pathogen material

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
like a byproduct from

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
the old mono bug the epstein-barr bug

85
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,680
that sits inside her liver

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,480
for years and years and years that

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,440
releases poisons those poisons go out

88
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
we react we react and then streptococcus

89
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,200
if you ever had strep throat when you

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
were younger or a kid or ear infections

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,120
or

92
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
a stye or uti that strep is still in her

93
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
system and once in a while a little

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
pocket of that junk just swoops out of

95
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,239
the liver

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
and it causes a hive and then if you run

97
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
into different other

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,599
exposures and triggers like toxins like

99
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,720
mold or air fresheners and scented

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
candles

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
that's going to really instigate it

102
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,200
that's really going to instigate it or

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,200
conventional cleaning supplies or bleach

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,000
that's really going to instigate it so

105
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,440
that's how it works so um you can clean

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,879
that up you can clean the liver up you

107
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,120
can work with your foods

108
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,640
medical medium information you can you

109
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
know do that because you can i would do

110
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,319

try to get rid of those hives that's

113
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
what i would do

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,400
um it would go with the mono eating i

115
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,400
would do the moderating cleanse and

116
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
cleanse the heal that's that's and just

117
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
do the potato mono eating cleanse with

118
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720

and so i can answer your question um

140

ruth says best foods and supplements

141
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
from

142
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,520
for rheumatoid arthritis so

143
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,520
ra that's caused by ebv

144
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,919
because that's what causes ra it causes

145
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
hashimoto's it causes fibromyalgia

146
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,639
that's what it causes it causes a lot of

147
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
different conditions it causes the

148
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,520
hashimoto's thyroiditis

149
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,360
and so ra that is the true

150
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
cause people don't know that it's it's

151
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,919
ebv so

152
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
if you're going to be eating foods or

153
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
you're going to be taking care of

154

heather says

231
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,919
i have questions about eggs how do we

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
substitute for them

233
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,960
or is it possible to eat them in foods

234
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
that are cooked

235
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
with them without being immune

236
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
compromised

237
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,240
look heather you know if you got like

238
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
something going on

239
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
aches and pains fatigue if you've been

240
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,720
diagnosed with any kind of symptom or

241
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
condition

242
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
if you're somebody that's living with

243
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
something that you don't want to live

244
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
with some kind of symptom

245
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
some kind of condition i would keep the

246
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,240
eggs out even in cooked food

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
i would keep the eggs out even when it's

248
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,879
in food

249
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,479
it's in something else and it's mixed i

250
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
would just keep it away if you can

251
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
because

252
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,280
that would that it could get us in

253
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,720
trouble so what's your egg replacement

254
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,800
avocado in a potato

255
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
i would replace egg with avocado or

256
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
potato

257
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,240
or if you really want both you know

258
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
that's what i would do i'd replace it

259
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
with both of those things avocado and

260
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,160
potato that's what i would do

261
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,400
um i would consider that charo says yep

262
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,440

263
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,560

chris says what is the best way to

267
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
address multiple health diagnoses so you

268
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,800
got multiple health diagnoses so what

269
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
i've always said is

270
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,320
which one here's the thing which one

271
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
bothers you the most

272
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
so that's what i've always said and you

273
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
can go in here find out which one

274
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,839
bothers you the most

275
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
you can look into it and work that way

276
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,440
if if you want you can maybe one that

277
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
bothers you less that's okay too and

278
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
start with that but what you're going to

279
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,760
find out about is

280
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
that if you address one of your

281
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
conditions in here you're going to

282
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,240

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,959

317
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440

time

322
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,160
i mean you do it in the full moon and

323
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,320
you do it in the week of the half moon

324
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,399

328
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,279

329
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,640
