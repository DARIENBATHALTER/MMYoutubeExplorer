[302.92 - 308.24] injuries around food whether being told
[306.24 - 310.44] when they were a child not to eat a
[308.24 - 313.56] certain food or being
[310.44 - 317.36] force-fed a certain food or just being
[313.56 - 319.64] told you have to eat this food or you
[317.36 - 322.08] take food that was given to you to go to
[319.64 - 324.28] school with and it's the only food you
[322.08 - 326.56] have so you have to eat it and then
[324.28 - 328.84] maybe you get sick of it so as you grow
[326.56 - 332.00] up and get older you're like I'm never
[328.84 - 334.28] going to eat that sandwich ever again
[332.00 - 336.16] and then if somebody comes from a family
[334.28 - 338.40] that didn't have enough money to buy
[336.16 - 340.96] certain foods and they only had certain
[338.40 - 343.16] foods to eat that were on the table and
[340.96 - 345.92] that was what was there and you couldn't
[343.16 - 348.72] do anything about it that can create an
[345.92 - 351.20] emotional injury around food as well and
[348.72 - 353.40] then if you're a teenager or young adult
[351.20 - 355.24] and you want to eat differently because
[353.40 - 357.08] you're witnessing a friend eat
[355.24 - 360.04] differently and they're eating a little
[357.08 - 362.28] bit healthier and you're young and you
[360.04 - 365.72] want to eat healthier it could be seen
[362.28 - 368.08] instantly by a family or friends or
[365.72 - 370.76] somebody or School teachers as if you
[368.08 - 374.00] have a bad eating disorder and then you
[370.76 - 376.76] hear that phrase that famous Infamous
[374.00 - 380.80] phrase the one that has Darkness behind
[376.76 - 382.64] it at the same time wears your protein
[380.80 - 384.32] you hear this when you're younger you
[382.64 - 387.36] hear this when you're older you hear
[384.32 - 391.00] this all the time it's out there where's
[387.36 - 393.08] your protein the concern of protein
[391.00 - 394.00] you're going to die if you don't get
[393.08 - 396.76] enough
[394.00 - 399.16] protein and as you try to pave your way
[396.76 - 401.72] Forge ahead eating healthier in your
[399.16 - 405.88] life or changing the course in the foods
[401.72 - 408.28] you're choosing the protein phrase is in
[405.88 - 410.52] your head so everything you do
[408.28 - 412.36] everything you touch you're doubting how
[410.52 - 414.76] much protein you're getting you're
[412.36 - 417.12] concerned about the protein people are
[414.76 - 419.68] telling you is there enough protein or
[417.12 - 422.60] asking you is there enough protein and
[419.68 - 424.96] that becomes something that sits inside
[422.60 - 427.60] your Consciousness in your soul and it
[424.96 - 431.04] doesn't leave it can stay in there
[427.60 - 433.68] forever and alter how you think about
[431.04 - 438.08] food and even your
[433.68 - 440.84] tastes remember this everyone has issues
[438.08 - 443.08] around eating there's no one out here
[440.84 - 445.76] there's no one on planet Earth there's
[443.08 - 448.32] no one probably in the Galaxy or even in
[445.76 - 451.64] the universe that doesn't have an issue
[448.32 - 456.48] around food there's never been a perfect
[451.64 - 458.64] situation anywhere regarding food are
[456.48 - 461.24] forebears waited in line during the
[458.64 - 463.92] Depression for a loaf of bread and they
[461.24 - 467.36] never forgot that they passed the
[463.92 - 470.32] stories on and along those stories went
[467.36 - 472.88] and even today we have wars and there's
[470.32 - 475.28] concerns about food and there's famine
[472.88 - 477.08] everywhere on this planet and then
[475.28 - 480.60] there's people who just can't simply
[477.08 - 482.40] afford food or people that are homeless
[480.60 - 485.36] and they just don't even have a home to
[482.40 - 488.40] even set up a meal and even when
[485.36 - 490.92] everything is just great perfect there's
[488.40 - 492.60] plenty of money plenty of affordability
[490.92 - 494.64] someone can actually buy all the food
[492.60 - 496.88] they want they can go to the best
[494.64 - 499.84] restaurants they can eat in restaurants
[496.88 - 503.12] every day the most highest priced
[499.84 - 505.88] decadent restaurant food fair they can
[503.12 - 508.64] have it it's there they still have
[505.88 - 511.40] issues they still have issues around
[508.64 - 513.36] Foods you see it on social you'll see
[511.40 - 514.80] somebody with all the means in the world
[513.36 - 516.60] they could buy what they want all the
[514.80 - 519.08] food they want they can eat all these
[516.60 - 521.84] decadent meals they can show it on their
[519.08 - 524.12] social media feeds and you can see them
[521.84 - 526.32] complaining they're complaining about
[524.12 - 528.24] their food which food where they're
[526.32 - 530.72] getting it what they're eating how they
[528.24 - 533.84] feel meanwhile somebody on the other
[530.72 - 536.40] side of the world is suffering suffering
[533.84 - 538.96] all huddled together in some Dwelling my
[536.40 - 541.40] bombs are going off or there's just no
[538.96 - 543.60] way to get any food and they're really
[541.40 - 545.68] struggling they have nothing to eat
[543.60 - 548.32] maybe haven't eaten in weeks and then
[545.68 - 550.44] you see it on social these people
[548.32 - 552.20] they'll blame their fears they'll blame
[550.44 - 554.44] their concerns they'll blame their
[552.20 - 556.60] worries they'll blame their problems
[554.44 - 558.44] they'll blame people they'll blame the
[556.60 - 560.76] healthy diet they're eating they'll
[558.44 - 563.00] blame anything and everything they'll
[560.76 - 565.28] blame it all on their food and there are
[563.00 - 566.92] endless variations of emotional wounds
[565.28 - 568.48] that people have things that have
[566.92 - 570.20] happened in their life things that have
[568.48 - 572.24] happened in school things that have
[570.20 - 573.40] happened because of their friends things
[572.24 - 577.60] that have happened because of their
[573.40 - 581.16] family experiences struggles hardships
[577.60 - 584.04] it ends up making a massive amount of
[581.16 - 587.60] combinations of issues that can all get
[584.04 - 591.28] funneled into food in the end and not
[587.60 - 593.88] only can someone have endless emotional
[591.28 - 596.16] injuries they can also have something
[593.88 - 599.44] physically going on different level of
[596.16 - 601.12] toxins poisons exposures Pharmaceuticals
[599.44 - 603.36] in their life all through their life
[601.12 - 605.64] everything and anything from toxic heavy
[603.36 - 608.08] metals other contamination that gets
[605.64 - 611.08] into the brain in their body and that
[608.08 - 614.96] can alter how they see food or even
[611.08 - 617.08] taste food no two people are the same no
[614.96 - 620.72] two people have the same experiences
[617.08 - 623.72] emotionally physically there are endless
[620.72 - 626.48] endless combinations of experiences and
[623.72 - 629.36] this plays a role in how they taste and
[626.48 - 632.28] seafood if you're with a friend or a
[629.36 - 635.68] family member and you're eating the same
[632.28 - 637.04] Pizza they're eating and both of you are
[635.68 - 639.44] enjoying it
[637.04 - 641.16] immensely your family member is saying
[639.44 - 643.64] how much they love it they're eating it
[641.16 - 645.68] it tastes so good it's a great pizza
[643.64 - 648.04] place and you're agreeing saying it's
[645.68 - 650.56] incredible this stuff is Bomb it is
[648.04 - 652.72] delicious it is amazing I'm going to buy
[650.56 - 656.68] another pizza here and both of you are
[652.72 - 659.00] enjoying it both of you are not tasting
[656.68 - 660.96] the same thing as you're eating it
[659.00 - 664.24] you're connect it you know what you're
[660.96 - 667.44] tasting you're enjoying it little sweet
[664.24 - 670.24] little salty nice and doughy you're
[667.44 - 672.64] tasting the sauce you taste the cheese
[670.24 - 673.76] you can taste a little bit of Basil it's
[672.64 - 676.52] hitting your
[673.76 - 678.40] brain you're in love with this slice of
[676.52 - 679.92] pizza as it's going down you're trying
[678.40 - 682.08] to hold back you're trying not to shove
[679.92 - 684.52] it all down at once you're trying to
[682.08 - 685.80] take your time a little bit but you can
[684.52 - 688.16] taste it and you know what you're
[685.80 - 691.24] tasting to a degree you may not be an
[688.16 - 693.84] expert at all all the flavor profiles
[691.24 - 695.64] but you feel it and you know it and at
[693.84 - 698.04] the same time the person that you're
[695.64 - 700.84] eating with is experiencing the same
[698.04 - 702.64] thing in that way they have a connection
[700.84 - 704.72] they taste a little bit of the basil
[702.64 - 706.40] they taste the sauce they taste the
[704.72 - 709.04] sweetness of the sauce they taste the
[706.40 - 711.76] cheese they like their crust they're
[709.04 - 715.12] enjoying it they love it but what you're
[711.76 - 718.36] tasting is not what they're tasting both
[715.12 - 721.44] of you are tasting two different things
[718.36 - 724.96] our brains control our experience they
[721.44 - 725.80] control the flavor our tongues those are
[724.96 - 729.16] just
[725.80 - 731.68] tools our tongues as a tool could get
[729.16 - 733.56] dirty and when they get dirty like if we
[731.68 - 736.56] have a stick of gum or we smoke a
[733.56 - 740.08] cigarette it can alter the taste buds
[736.56 - 743.84] but still it's all deriving from our
[740.08 - 747.56] brain yes we can saturate our tool which
[743.84 - 750.68] is our tongue we can contaminate it it
[747.56 - 753.84] can get dirty with other things and
[750.68 - 757.36] toxins cigarette smoke different
[753.84 - 759.68] artificial flavorings it can alter it as
[757.36 - 762.28] far as as a tool but that's as far as it
[759.68 - 764.92] goes the brain is where it's all
[762.28 - 767.60] happening with flavor contamination
[764.92 - 770.36] Place aside the controls and the
[767.60 - 772.92] experience come from the brain central
[770.36 - 777.00] nervous system signals travel back and
[772.92 - 778.88] forth between the cranial nerves so if
[777.00 - 780.40] there's any kind of interference in the
[778.88 - 783.68] brain
[780.40 - 786.52] like toxic heavy metals something toxic
[783.68 - 789.36] inside the brain then it can alter how
[786.52 - 792.04] we perceive flavors inside our mouth
[789.36 - 794.96] because the cranial nerves either become
[792.04 - 797.40] poisoned or neurons sending messages to
[794.96 - 801.40] these nerves become poisoned so if the
[797.40 - 803.84] brain has any kind of solvents MSG toxic
[801.40 - 807.36] heavy metals petrochemicals pesticides
[803.84 - 811.68] herbicides other toxic chemicals or
[807.36 - 814.72] viral neurotoxins from hsv1 or any virus
[811.68 - 817.32] stored up in brain tissue then that can
[814.72 - 820.60] affect whether someone likes or dislikes
[817.32 - 823.48] certain foods and drink and if someone
[820.60 - 825.52] has an elevated amount of mercury inside
[823.48 - 828.36] their brain and it's affecting their
[825.52 - 832.24] cranial nerves in any way possible it
[828.36 - 835.24] can change how cilantro tastes it can
[832.24 - 838.12] make it so cilantro is not pleasing
[835.24 - 840.16] doesn't have a good flavor doesn't taste
[838.12 - 844.56] good doesn't feel feel good on the
[840.16 - 847.12] pallet until the Mercury is going away
[844.56 - 850.64] so as the Mercury is decreasing and the
[847.12 - 854.20] metals are leaving the brain cilantro
[850.64 - 856.08] starts to become pleasing agreeable this
[854.20 - 858.72] can change and alter depending on where
[856.08 - 860.84] the Mercury is but there are thousands
[858.72 - 864.00] and thousands of testimonials from
[860.84 - 866.92] people who are doing the medical medium
[864.00 - 869.64] heavy metal detox and as they're doing
[866.92 - 872.08] it they start out hating cilantro or
[869.64 - 874.08] they always did hate cilantro and as
[872.08 - 876.48] they go along and they're getting rid of
[874.08 - 879.36] the Mercury the toxic heavy metals
[876.48 - 881.72] what's happening is they all of a sudden
[879.36 - 884.56] become in love with cilantro it's
[881.72 - 887.68] pleasing it's agreeable they like it and
[884.56 - 889.40] it becomes part of their life as if they
[887.68 - 892.24] should have never had it out of their
[889.40 - 894.40] diet to begin with they love it now
[892.24 - 897.32] contaminants do other things inside
[894.40 - 900.32] people's brains not just alter the
[897.32 - 903.12] fever but Al alter things like
[900.32 - 905.20] consistency issues like someone will be
[903.12 - 907.92] like I don't like avocado cuz I don't
[905.20 - 911.12] like the texture I don't like anything
[907.92 - 914.72] mushy I can't do it I only like crunchy
[911.12 - 917.00] things or I like to sink my teeth in
[914.72 - 919.28] something and if I can't sink my teeth
[917.00 - 922.28] into it then I'm not going to like it
[919.28 - 924.00] these are messages coming from the brain
[922.28 - 925.76] and a lot of those messages can be
[924.00 - 928.24] derived from the toxic heavy metals
[925.76 - 930.48] inside the brain rerouting electrical
[928.24 - 932.96] impulses messing with
[930.48 - 934.96] neurotransmitters and a combination of
[932.96 - 937.80] emotional injuries throughout life
[934.96 - 940.56] whether from childhood or adulthood but
[937.80 - 944.00] the combination of emotional issues
[940.56 - 945.72] emotional injuries combination of that
[944.00 - 949.12] plus the toxic heavy metals and other
[945.72 - 952.04] contaminants all put together make it so
[949.12 - 954.60] there are millions and millions and
[952.04 - 958.12] billions of combinations of how people
[954.60 - 961.08] see food feel food taste food and enjoy
[958.12 - 963.16] food back 2,000 years ago if you were an
[961.08 - 965.92] emperor and you were given by your
[963.16 - 968.60] medicine man a Mercury Elixir cuz that's
[965.92 - 971.64] what happened back then to treat any
[968.60 - 974.96] kind of issues and that mercury Elixir
[971.64 - 978.00] altered your taste where you can taste
[974.96 - 980.32] food differently and it's not the same
[978.00 - 982.96] and your Chef who made you the same meal
[980.32 - 986.04] that you like every day gives you that
[982.96 - 988.76] same meal and you tasted it and it was
[986.04 - 991.44] awful and tasted like poison you would
[988.76 - 993.72] then then chop off that Chef's head
[991.44 - 998.28] that's how serious people are about food
[993.72 - 1000.52] going all the way back dead serious here
[998.28 - 1003.64] on planet Earth taste can be the
[1000.52 - 1005.24] ultimate controller it can determine how
[1003.64 - 1008.84] you're going to heal what you're going
[1005.24 - 1012.88] to do for yourself there are people in
[1008.84 - 1015.12] the world that could have healed if they
[1012.88 - 1019.72] can get past their
[1015.12 - 1022.72] taste people naturally do not like leafy
[1019.72 - 1026.60] greens people naturally do not like a
[1022.72 - 1028.88] bitter leafy green people don't like
[1026.60 - 1033.40] lettuce they have to have the lettuce
[1028.88 - 1037.96] drowned out by a dressing or cheese or
[1033.40 - 1042.04] eggs or some sort of oil vinegar lots of
[1037.96 - 1045.52] salt some sugar dressings that aren't
[1042.04 - 1048.40] good for them people can't just eat a
[1045.52 - 1051.88] leafy green on its own it's not easy
[1048.40 - 1054.80] it's not desirable a piece of kale a
[1051.88 - 1057.96] collared green most people have trouble
[1054.80 - 1060.72] just eating a piece of fruit an apple a
[1057.96 - 1063.36] berry sure they'll eat it if you give it
[1060.72 - 1065.80] to them it's in their hand they'll eat
[1063.36 - 1067.36] it they'll chew it but in the end they
[1065.80 - 1069.56] don't want to sit there and eat apples
[1067.36 - 1072.00] all day and they don't want to sit there
[1069.56 - 1074.92] and eat raspberries all day they don't
[1072.00 - 1077.28] want to sit there and eat melons all day
[1074.92 - 1079.40] they don't want to eat really any fruit
[1077.28 - 1082.92] and if they eat a piece of fruit they
[1079.40 - 1086.80] want to offset it pretty shortly after
[1082.92 - 1089.80] with something like chicken salad or
[1086.80 - 1092.04] something else a hamburger or something
[1089.80 - 1094.96] else it's not something people really
[1092.04 - 1098.40] want to do it's eat a leafy green or eat
[1094.96 - 1101.96] a piece of fruit a plum an apple a
[1098.40 - 1104.24] cherry a berry for example if somebody
[1101.96 - 1106.88] drinks a smoothie they want milk in that
[1104.24 - 1109.12] smoothie they want peanut butter in that
[1106.88 - 1112.24] smoothie they want kefir and that
[1109.12 - 1115.68] smoothie yogurt they want something in
[1112.24 - 1118.76] there something that kind of brings the
[1115.68 - 1122.04] temperature down brings their worries
[1118.76 - 1125.36] down the worry of tasting something like
[1122.04 - 1127.96] an astringent fruit or a bitter green
[1125.36 - 1131.20] that's the worry it becomes a smoothie
[1127.96 - 1133.96] where it's just a protein based smoothie
[1131.20 - 1136.84] with something in there like milk and
[1133.96 - 1139.44] dairy and yogurt and nut Butters and
[1136.84 - 1142.72] oils and they want to wash down the
[1139.44 - 1145.40] medicine away with all of that fat and
[1142.72 - 1147.40] all of that Dairy and then when you say
[1145.40 - 1149.68] hey how about a sweet potato if you had
[1147.40 - 1153.24] one of those and they would say I don't
[1149.68 - 1156.88] like the texture I hate yams I can't eat
[1153.24 - 1159.36] a sweet potato can I put something on it
[1156.88 - 1162.28] can I eat it with something or how about
[1159.36 - 1164.92] a potato a plain potato I can't eat a
[1162.28 - 1167.84] potato plain I need to have sour cream
[1164.92 - 1171.12] on it some cheese some other things on
[1167.84 - 1173.32] there some yogurt or something hey how
[1171.12 - 1175.48] about a avocado I'm like I don't like
[1173.32 - 1178.68] the mushy texture I don't like the
[1175.48 - 1180.92] consistency I can't stand guacamole I've
[1178.68 - 1183.84] heard so many different things from so
[1180.92 - 1186.84] many different people and it gets in
[1183.84 - 1190.44] their way of healing and I call it the
[1186.84 - 1193.04] taste demon and one of the reasons why I
[1190.44 - 1195.84] call it the taste demon is because of
[1193.04 - 1197.92] the trickery that goes on with it you
[1195.84 - 1200.96] tell somebody why don't you try some
[1197.92 - 1203.20] avocado they say it's too mushy they
[1200.96 - 1205.36] don't like the texture but then later on
[1203.20 - 1208.32] at night they're eating an ice cream in
[1205.36 - 1210.92] front of the TV someone will say they
[1208.32 - 1212.96] like crunch they like crunchy things
[1210.92 - 1215.56] they like chips and they can't get off
[1212.96 - 1218.08] their chips they need it it's like their
[1215.56 - 1220.96] therapy and I'll say why don't we do
[1218.08 - 1223.36] some dehydrated apple chips they're
[1220.96 - 1226.32] crunchy they're delicious and they'll
[1223.36 - 1228.48] say no I'll say to somebody are you
[1226.32 - 1230.20] eating that salad every day that I was
[1228.48 - 1233.08] tell telling you about are you making
[1230.20 - 1236.24] that salad they'll say yes I'm having my
[1233.08 - 1239.36] salad every single day and I still don't
[1236.24 - 1241.80] feel good aw how come and I'll sit there
[1239.36 - 1244.80] and I'll scratch my head and then s so
[1241.80 - 1247.44] will say because their salad has changed
[1244.80 - 1250.56] it's got pieces of ham in there pieces
[1247.44 - 1252.48] of egg in there and I'll ask them what
[1250.56 - 1255.00] happened to your salad what's in there
[1252.48 - 1258.08] and they'll be like well I just feel
[1255.00 - 1260.76] like I need more protein so I'm just
[1258.08 - 1263.28] switching the chickpeas instead of the
[1260.76 - 1266.92] garbanza beans she told me about I'm now
[1263.28 - 1269.48] putting ham in there and um and I have
[1266.92 - 1272.40] croutons in there too and I'll be like
[1269.48 - 1275.04] well the croutons are the gluten
[1272.40 - 1277.60] remember the gluten was bothering you
[1275.04 - 1280.92] and be like yeah I can't help it I can't
[1277.60 - 1283.80] eat the salad any other way The Taste
[1280.92 - 1286.68] demon I'll say to someone you can have
[1283.80 - 1289.84] your celery juice in the morning you can
[1286.68 - 1292.12] have your hmds in the morning morning
[1289.84 - 1294.44] you can have some steamed potatoes for
[1292.12 - 1296.64] lunch if you really want or a later
[1294.44 - 1298.16] lunch in the afternoon and they'll say
[1296.64 - 1299.76] oh no I can't eat that much in the
[1298.16 - 1303.36] morning I can't eat anything in the
[1299.76 - 1305.44] morning ever I need to be not eating it
[1303.36 - 1308.24] doesn't make me feel good I can't eat
[1305.44 - 1310.56] like that say okay okay I respect that
[1308.24 - 1312.96] let's figure something else out a week
[1310.56 - 1314.56] later I'm just not doing good I'm not
[1312.96 - 1317.00] feeling good I'll be like what you been
[1314.56 - 1319.24] doing lately well I've been just eating
[1317.00 - 1321.08] a lot of stuff like in in the morning
[1319.24 - 1323.92] and early afternoon I'm like what are
[1321.08 - 1326.76] you eating well I had pizza out for
[1323.92 - 1329.36] lunch with a friend in the morning I had
[1326.76 - 1332.36] like four coffees and decided to eat a
[1329.36 - 1333.64] Danish I thought you didn't eat though I
[1332.36 - 1335.68] thought you weren't eating in the
[1333.64 - 1339.12] morning so you're not going to do the
[1335.68 - 1341.08] celery juice or the hmds but 3 days
[1339.12 - 1343.16] later you're going to eat a pizza at
[1341.08 - 1345.72] noon and you're going to eat a whole
[1343.16 - 1348.84] bunch of danishes and so forth this is
[1345.72 - 1350.52] the workings of The Taste demon and then
[1348.84 - 1352.96] I'm talking to somebody and they're like
[1350.52 - 1357.32] has to be grass-fed beef aw that's what
[1352.96 - 1360.96] I only eat it's only grass-fed beef aw
[1357.32 - 1363.36] and free range pasture raised chickens
[1360.96 - 1365.76] it's the only thing I eat it's those
[1363.36 - 1368.44] things right there week later you talk
[1365.76 - 1370.16] to him and you're like okay give me the
[1368.44 - 1373.16] whole rundown what you've been eating
[1370.16 - 1376.40] every day like well been eating my usual
[1373.16 - 1378.76] doing pretty good and then they say well
[1376.40 - 1381.88] went to a restaurant with a friend like
[1378.76 - 1385.28] what' you order chicken was it free
[1381.88 - 1388.20] range is it pasturised uh I don't really
[1385.28 - 1391.72] know I I actually didn't ask you know
[1388.20 - 1394.96] we're just out and whatever The Taste
[1391.72 - 1397.68] demon could go on and on forever so many
[1394.96 - 1400.76] different variables variations so many
[1397.68 - 1403.56] different Antics and so much trickery
[1400.76 - 1406.24] and that's how the taste demon works and
[1403.56 - 1409.12] this can get in the way of people
[1406.24 - 1412.40] heading to the Finish Line to heal
[1409.12 - 1415.20] people who just can't get past it the
[1412.40 - 1417.88] taste demon takes over and they gobble
[1415.20 - 1420.76] down that chocolate bar they gobble down
[1417.88 - 1423.32] that chocolate cake they drink their
[1420.76 - 1425.68] coffee every single day they eat
[1423.32 - 1427.68] something that isn't helping them they
[1425.68 - 1429.80] do something that's not helping them in
[1427.68 - 1433.48] health they take something that's not
[1429.80 - 1435.52] helping them and that same taste demon
[1433.48 - 1437.72] will even turn that person against
[1435.52 - 1439.12] somebody because they want to protect
[1437.72 - 1440.40] their food
[1439.12 - 1442.64] or their
[1440.40 - 1445.36] addictions or their
[1442.64 - 1448.16] indulgences they want to protect it till
[1445.36 - 1451.20] the cows come home and they'll blame
[1448.16 - 1453.96] somebody else or something else is
[1451.20 - 1457.28] causing their problems and causing their
[1453.96 - 1459.88] sickness and causing their poor health
[1457.28 - 1461.52] and their poor mental health it's the

[1546.12 - 1550.88] taste buds have been had don't make my
[1549.76 - 1554.12] Foods
[1550.88 - 1557.60] restrictive what do you think how's it
[1554.12 - 1562.16] vibe in your mouth mouth watering or

[1570.72 - 1578.28] blue what's gotten into you you're
[1574.64 - 1580.84] pointing your butter knife at me you're
[1578.28 - 1582.76] disappointed because the meal is too
[1580.84 - 1585.44] soggy and
[1582.76 - 1588.68] overdone just because you can't cut the
[1585.44 - 1593.64] kiche and the knife is bending you're
[1588.68 - 1598.08] done what Have We Become overrun by our
[1593.64 - 1600.92] taste buds and their elected taste fun
[1598.08 - 1604.56] doesn't matter if the meal was
[1600.92 - 1608.92] Homespun a bad meal has been known in
[1604.56 - 1613.68] history to make a person take out a gun
[1608.92 - 1616.80] in olden times if the king queen Emperor
[1613.68 - 1620.16] had a bad meal the chef would not just
[1616.80 - 1624.24] be fired the chef would be burned at the
[1620.16 - 1628.12] stake by fire the next one hired a year
[1624.24 - 1631.48] later would also expire and around and
[1628.12 - 1634.72] around it would go food becomes death
[1631.48 - 1638.20] defying and treacherous but the same
[1634.72 - 1641.84] time because the taste demons already
[1638.20 - 1645.00] exist in everyone's mind we protect our
[1641.84 - 1648.48] ways of eating and almost never give up
[1645.00 - 1651.68] our favorite feedings until one day
[1648.48 - 1655.40] we're too sick enough to learn how to
[1651.68 - 1658.16] refeed ourselves so our bodies reverse
