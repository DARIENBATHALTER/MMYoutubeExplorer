[0.24 - 3.04] out there about supplements and how it
[1.92 - 5.84] works
[3.04 - 7.60] so when we get a blood test it's just a
[5.84 - 10.16] snapshot in time so we have to remember
[7.60 - 12.80] that it's just a window in time that's
[10.16 - 14.64] what it is it's like this one snapshot
[12.80 - 16.16] and that's something to understand when
[14.64 - 18.64] it comes down to blood work and stuff so
[16.16 - 21.44] when someone says well
[18.64 - 23.60] you know my b12 is fine in my blood test
[21.44 - 25.92] then why are you sick
[23.60 - 28.40] then why are you sick my blood test was
[25.92 - 30.08] great my blood work is great doctor says
[28.40 - 31.84] everything looks good then why are you
[30.08 - 33.52] at the doctor's office
[31.84 - 35.52] you know why are you sick why are you
[33.52 - 37.36] breaking out with acne why do you have
[35.52 - 38.88] severe depression why do you have skin
[37.36 - 40.32] problems why do you have eczema why do
[38.88 - 42.48] you have psoriasis why do you have some
[40.32 - 43.84] other problem too so there's a lot of
[42.48 - 45.84] confusion out there it's like no my
[43.84 - 47.28] blood works fine looks good
[45.84 - 50.64] you know everything looks good my
[47.28 - 52.80] nutrients are good oh my b12 is great
[50.64 - 54.80] yeah a year later
[52.80 - 56.00] you got brain fog and you're at a
[54.80 - 58.40] specialist
[56.00 - 60.32] a year later you're getting an mri
[58.40 - 62.40] two years later you're sick with
[60.32 - 63.68] something else three years later you got
[62.40 - 65.44] fatigue
[63.68 - 68.00] four years later hairs falling out
[65.44 - 70.32] fatigue skin problems more acne
[68.00 - 72.88] depression everything else and that's
[70.32 - 74.72] what we're up against it's so but your
[72.88 - 76.64] blood work was fine
[74.72 - 79.52] your blood test was great
[76.64 - 80.40] your b12 was perfect
[79.52 - 83.12] right
[80.40 - 84.32] your b12 was perfect meanwhile
[83.12 - 86.16] you're sick
[84.32 - 88.40] it's like oh my blood works too my blood
[86.16 - 91.20] work was great i'm great today three
[88.40 - 93.36] years later you're sick
[91.20 - 94.72] so let's talk about like how this works
[93.36 - 96.32] to begin with and everything around it
[94.72 - 97.68] so this is all important information
[96.32 - 98.80] we're talking about supplements today a
[97.68 - 100.24] little bit
[98.80 - 101.60] specifically we're going to talk about
[100.24 - 103.04] melatonin
[101.60 - 104.12] that's a good one to talk about right
[103.04 - 106.96] there
[104.12 - 110.00] 5mthf we're going to talk about that
[106.96 - 111.28] cat's call i'm not sponsored by the way
[110.00 - 112.48] cat's claw
[111.28 - 114.16] we're going to talk about that a little
[112.48 - 116.56] bit too maybe a little bit of
[114.16 - 118.80] ashwagandha if we have time of course we
[116.56 - 120.40] got the b12 here
[118.80 - 121.68] and
[120.40 - 124.24] i think liz had a question about
[121.68 - 125.60] elderberry circle with 369 cleanses
[124.24 - 127.44] right because there's honey in
[125.60 - 128.88] elderberry in this elderberry syrup
[127.44 - 130.72] which is incredible
[128.88 - 132.72] because it's not it's not something else
[130.72 - 135.04] that's in there it's not like it's not
[132.72 - 137.44] like straight corn syrup or sugar or
[135.04 - 139.60] anything like that so it's it's nothing
[137.44 - 142.24] like that too and that's important to
[139.60 - 144.08] know
[142.24 - 147.04] so
[144.08 - 149.04] when it so you can do the 369 with the
[147.04 - 150.24] 369 cleanse
[149.04 - 152.24] okay
[150.24 - 153.52] you can do the elderberry syrup with 369
[152.24 - 155.12] cleanse that's that's not a problem it's
[153.52 - 156.40] not a lot of honey to begin with and
[155.12 - 158.56] it's okay
[156.40 - 160.32] you're welcome liz
[158.56 - 161.60] i mean if i was doing the 369 cleanse
[160.32 - 163.12] right now and i want to take elderberry
[161.60 - 165.76] syrup i would do it i'll take all the
[163.12 - 165.76] berry syrup
[166.72 - 171.44] all right so here we are so i want to go
[169.20 - 174.56] back to the blood work a little bit
[171.44 - 176.48] it's interesting how someone will say
[174.56 - 178.72] that all checks out finding my blood
[176.48 - 180.80] work my blood work was good my b12 was
[178.72 - 183.60] good my calcium was good my other
[180.80 - 185.68] nutrients were good and everything
[183.60 - 187.36] but they're sick and they're dealing
[185.68 - 189.52] with autoimmune they're dealing with all
[187.36 - 191.52] kinds of other issues and everything so
[189.52 - 192.72] what is it is it really good or not so i
[191.52 - 195.20] just want to start out real quick with
[192.72 - 196.84] the b12 for a couple of seconds when b12
[195.20 - 200.08] is
[196.84 - 202.88] high in your system so hey my b12 is
[200.08 - 205.52] high i don't need b12
[202.88 - 209.12] but if there's any kind of mental
[205.52 - 210.84] illness mental health issues
[209.12 - 214.08] if there's any kind of
[210.84 - 217.12] autoimmune anything neurological on any
[214.08 - 219.20] level nervous system brain and central
[217.12 - 221.92] nervous system is if there's anything
[219.20 - 224.72] like that anything brain
[221.92 - 227.04] central nervous system
[224.72 - 228.96] elevated b12
[227.04 - 231.44] doesn't mean oh
[228.96 - 232.48] that's it don't need to take b12 ever
[231.44 - 234.08] again
[232.48 - 235.60] that's not how it works a couple of
[234.08 - 237.44] things happen a lot of people are on a
[235.60 - 238.40] high fat diet when they're on a high fat
[237.44 - 240.80] diet
[238.40 - 242.96] the b12 suspends in their bloodstream so
[240.80 - 246.88] if they get a blood test and the blood
[242.96 - 250.40] test shows that their b12 is high
[246.88 - 253.20] and they had fat the previous day
[250.40 - 255.36] nuts seeds nut milks and which is fine
[253.20 - 256.88] right chicken if someone wants to eat
[255.36 - 259.60] chicken this isn't an anti-animal
[256.88 - 261.60] protein anti-vegan whatever i'm just
[259.60 - 262.64] talking about fats right
[261.60 - 265.36] okay
[262.64 - 267.36] cheese butter whatever which is not good
[265.36 - 270.16] that's not good right so say they had
[267.36 - 272.24] some kind of animal fat or say they had
[270.16 - 274.16] some kind of plant fat or even avocado
[272.24 - 276.64] the day before
[274.16 - 279.12] it can suspend nutrients in the
[276.64 - 280.80] bloodstream not allowing them to absorb
[279.12 - 282.48] easy so when you get your blood test and
[280.80 - 284.48] you're like oh my b12 is high i need to
[282.48 - 287.60] stop my b12 meanwhile the fats in the
[284.48 - 289.36] diet are suspending the nutrients in the
[287.60 - 290.88] bloodstream so they don't enter into
[289.36 - 292.96] cells
[290.88 - 294.84] it's an important piece of information
[292.96 - 296.40] so
[294.84 - 297.92] um
[296.40 - 299.28] yeah
[297.92 - 300.96] we're here right now we're talking about
[299.28 - 302.48] supplements
[300.96 - 304.16] we're talking about the central nervous
[302.48 - 305.76] system in the moment talking about b12
[304.16 - 307.60] how it enters into the central nervous
[305.76 - 311.36] system so this is this is critical
[307.60 - 312.48] anybody with neurological lyme
[311.36 - 314.16] that
[312.48 - 316.32] gets
[314.16 - 319.12] information about their blood work and
[316.32 - 320.80] their b12 is high and i was telling a
[319.12 - 322.56] doctor this the other day
[320.80 - 324.72] the doctor said to me what do you
[322.56 - 326.48] recommend anthony because i i give
[324.72 - 329.68] information to doctors all the time i
[326.48 - 331.84] say i recommend that your patient stays
[329.68 - 332.72] on b12
[331.84 - 334.64] because
[332.72 - 336.64] they're having neurological symptoms
[334.64 - 338.40] they got neurological lyme
[336.64 - 339.76] they get all the symptoms associated
[338.40 - 341.60] with it right
[339.76 - 342.96] and even though their blood tests this
[341.60 - 346.16] doctor was saying well their blood test
[342.96 - 348.48] shows they got plenty of b12
[346.16 - 350.56] but that doesn't mean the nervous system
[348.48 - 352.48] has plenty of b12 your central nervous
[350.56 - 354.56] system doesn't have enough b12 doesn't
[352.48 - 356.96] mean your brain has enough b12
[354.56 - 359.76] it's a snapshot in the bloodstream
[356.96 - 361.76] most likely the b12 they're taking
[359.76 - 363.20] is just suspended because of the fats
[361.76 - 364.96] and oils and i said well what is your
[363.20 - 367.60] neurological lyme patients on he said
[364.96 - 369.52] well i got them on a keto diet
[367.60 - 370.96] i'm like so you got them on a keto diet
[369.52 - 373.36] so they're on a high fat diet so the
[370.96 - 374.56] fats are suspending the nutrients in
[373.36 - 376.08] their bloodstream and it's not even
[374.56 - 379.36] getting to their central nervous system
[376.08 - 382.56] so the details matter is what i'm saying
[379.36 - 384.96] the details matter all about it right
[382.56 - 387.04] so when someone's dealing with a
[384.96 - 389.04] neurological symptom of any kind so what
[387.04 - 390.64] is the neurological symptom
[389.04 - 392.80] tightness of the chest anxiety
[390.64 - 394.64] depression aches and pains tingles and
[392.80 - 396.48] numbness ringing in the ears vertigo and
[394.64 - 398.80] dizziness those are just some of them
[396.48 - 401.20] restless leg syndrome creepy crawlies on
[398.80 - 403.20] the skin sciatic nerve pain back pain
[401.20 - 406.40] neck pain head pain migraines this is
[403.20 - 411.12] all neurological ocd depersonalization
[406.40 - 412.08] bipolar neurological adhd neurological
[411.12 - 413.36] so
[412.08 - 415.04] and that's just some of them you guys
[413.36 - 416.24] that's some of the neurological symptoms
[415.04 - 417.76] right there
[416.24 - 420.56] so when it comes down to a central
[417.76 - 422.32] nervous system issue like fatigue
[420.56 - 424.08] severe fatigue or any kind of fatigue
[422.32 - 426.16] that's neurological
[424.08 - 428.16] we got to make sure that the b12 we get
[426.16 - 430.24] we're getting enough b12 to the central
[428.16 - 432.72] nervous system to the brain stem to the
[430.24 - 433.52] brain to the vagus nerves
[432.72 - 435.92] so
[433.52 - 437.76] our vagus nerves require b12 it's what
[435.92 - 439.60] keeps us alive
[437.76 - 441.52] and so what happens is a lot of people
[439.60 - 443.36] so let's go into like other problems
[441.52 - 446.00] that happen so somebody be like well
[443.36 - 447.52] i'm on a b12
[446.00 - 449.52] and i'm like well what kind of b12
[447.52 - 451.68] you're on so i'll tell the doctor well
[449.52 - 452.88] the doctor be like the doctor i'll talk
[451.68 - 455.68] to you will be like well i'm giving my
[452.88 - 457.84] patients aw i'm giving my patients a b12
[455.68 - 459.76] so can you get the b12 out
[457.84 - 461.36] not sure sure i'll get the b12 out i
[459.76 - 463.04] could can you send me a snapshot of that
[461.36 - 464.80] b12 can you get it out and send a
[463.04 - 467.12] snapshot of that b12
[464.80 - 469.44] so the doctor will send
[467.12 - 470.48] a photograph of the b12
[469.44 - 472.72] okay
[470.48 - 474.48] and then i'll look at it and then i'll
[472.72 - 476.48] say can you take a snapshot on the back
[474.48 - 478.40] with the ingredients
[476.48 - 480.32] and in the back
[478.40 - 481.76] it'll say everything there right
[480.32 - 483.52] including some things that won't say
[481.76 - 485.36] that are hidden that companies do all
[483.52 - 487.20] the time vimrgy doesn't do that i'm not
[485.36 - 490.48] sponsored but i'm just talking about the
[487.20 - 492.00] b12 that i trust the most and
[490.48 - 494.00] so i'll look in the back of the bottle
[492.00 - 496.32] it'll be citric acid in there or you'll
[494.00 - 497.44] see something crazy like a filler or
[496.32 - 499.84] you'll see
[497.44 - 501.20] all right you'll see a natural flavoring
[499.84 - 503.04] in there
[501.20 - 504.64] you'll see citric acid alcohol you'll
[503.04 - 506.56] see alcohol in there
[504.64 - 508.16] you'll see a hidden alcohol
[506.56 - 509.68] you'll see all kinds of things in there
[508.16 - 511.68] and i'll be like okay well and then you
[509.68 - 513.60] won't see the right kind of b12 the
[511.68 - 515.68] point i'm trying to say is all these
[513.60 - 517.68] details matter to somebody healing to
[515.68 - 520.16] somebody actually surviving and healing
[517.68 - 522.72] and recovering
[520.16 - 524.32] it's critical to have the right things
[522.72 - 526.16] so that's one thing i wanted to talk
[524.32 - 528.00] about the b12 thing another another
[526.16 - 530.96] thing too people have reactions to b12
[528.00 - 533.52] when it's all these bad b12s now
[530.96 - 536.16] when someone had b12 shots i just got to
[533.52 - 539.60] tell you guys when someone had b12 shots
[536.16 - 541.76] they become sensitive to b12
[539.60 - 544.64] so if they ever had a b12 shot in their
[541.76 - 546.64] life they could become sensitive to b12
[544.64 - 551.36] and that's when it's critical
[546.64 - 552.40] to have the 5mthf right the methylfolate
[551.36 - 554.40] so
[552.40 - 556.32] because what happens is when someone had
[554.40 - 558.80] b12 shots
[556.32 - 560.56] a methylation problem occurs with the
[558.80 - 562.96] b12
[560.56 - 566.08] because they had it they had a shot of
[562.96 - 568.40] b12 so when you have a shot of b12 the
[566.08 - 568.40] body
[568.56 - 572.72] starts to
[570.16 - 574.56] start to identify it as not being a
[572.72 - 577.12] positive thing
[574.56 - 578.80] so then you have an allergic reaction
[577.12 - 580.56] that happens where an antibody actually
[578.80 - 582.32] gets built up it's that's really what
[580.56 - 584.40] happens an antibody gets filled up
[582.32 - 586.96] towards your b12 because if you had the
[584.40 - 589.60] b12 shot when that happens you don't
[586.96 - 591.44] methylate b12 and
[589.60 - 593.68] so a lot of people have difficulties
[591.44 - 595.20] methylating b12 one reason is because
[593.68 - 597.20] their liver
[595.20 - 600.00] is really dysfunctional another reason
[597.20 - 601.68] is because they had the b12 shots
[600.00 - 603.76] so when they had to when they had that
[601.68 - 606.00] in their life and they end up taking b12
[603.76 - 607.52] they feel like they might react
[606.00 - 609.20] one of the reasons why the react is
[607.52 - 611.04] they'll do the wrong b12 one with
[609.20 - 612.88] alcohol citric acid and add things you
[611.04 - 615.20] don't know about msg and all that so
[612.88 - 616.80] they're reacting to the msg
[615.20 - 619.08] there's no msg in this one this is the
[616.80 - 622.16] vimergy b12 right v is in victor i m
[619.08 - 624.72] ergy.com if you don't know the company
[622.16 - 626.88] the point is is that they'll use a b12
[624.72 - 629.44] somebody will use a b12 and have msg in
[626.88 - 631.04] there and they'll react
[629.44 - 633.60] that's one problem another two is they
[631.04 - 635.68] had b12 shots before
[633.60 - 638.16] if they had b12 shots before they get
[635.68 - 640.00] sensitive to b12
[638.16 - 641.36] so because they they end up having a
[640.00 - 642.32] difficult
[641.36 - 644.08] time
[642.32 - 646.40] methylating their their liver has a
[644.08 - 649.36] difficult time methylating so
[646.40 - 651.76] that's why i like the 5mthf so
[649.36 - 654.00] anybody who thinks they have a b12
[651.76 - 655.20] problem whether they're using a bad b12
[654.00 - 656.96] and that's one of the reasons why
[655.20 - 658.24] they're having the problem and using one
[656.96 - 660.16] that's not good
[658.24 - 662.16] regardless it's good to take the
[660.16 - 663.84] methylfolate so if someone thinks they
[662.16 - 666.64] have a b12 issue it's good to take the
[663.84 - 668.40] methylfolate at the same time if you
[666.64 - 669.52] want or you can take it another time ask
[668.40 - 671.04] your doctor it's right for you i'm just
[669.52 - 672.40] telling you what i recommend the doctors
[671.04 - 673.52] i talk to doctors about their patients
[672.40 - 676.08] all the time
[673.52 - 678.40] chris chris sage says vimergy b12 has
[676.08 - 680.40] gotten me off mattress island
[678.40 - 683.44] carissa
[680.40 - 685.12] i i gotta tell you something right
[683.44 - 686.16] all right and you're you're on facebook
[685.12 - 688.40] okay
[686.16 - 689.60] i can't tell you how many
[688.40 - 691.36] people
[689.60 - 693.92] i've seen stuck on mattress island with
[691.36 - 695.76] neurological symptoms
[693.92 - 698.72] their life is
[695.76 - 700.32] limited the quality of life they've lost
[698.72 - 702.48] they're on mattress island most of the
[700.32 - 703.68] time in their life and the right kind of
[702.48 - 706.40] b12
[703.68 - 708.72] and the right dosage i've seen people
[706.40 - 711.04] turn around in 10 days from being on
[708.72 - 713.20] mattress island i've talked to doctors
[711.04 - 715.12] who come to me and be like i got so many
[713.20 - 717.28] people laying on mattress island what
[715.12 - 720.48] you call mattress island aw i got so
[717.28 - 722.72] many people on mattress island
[720.48 - 724.56] and what do i need to do and i'm like
[722.72 - 727.28] get b12 in every one of them while their
[724.56 - 729.68] b12 is okay though aw
[727.28 - 732.40] i checked their b12 their b12 seems to
[729.68 - 735.44] be adequate enough in the blood work
[732.40 - 737.68] why are they on mattress island
[735.44 - 740.16] so get the b12 in them right the right
[737.68 - 742.88] kind and then the doctor would be like
[740.16 - 745.12] i'm seeing people rise up like from the
[742.88 - 747.52] grave practically
[745.12 - 749.20] 10 days later 12 days later they're
[747.52 - 750.96] rising up
[749.20 - 753.20] they're able to function more they're
[750.96 - 755.12] off a mattress island a little bit more
[753.20 - 757.12] each day they're using their muscles a
[755.12 - 759.36] little bit more now they're doing things
[757.12 - 761.84] in their kitchen they're going they're
[759.36 - 764.40] they're taking walks outside
[761.84 - 766.56] these details matter
[764.40 - 768.64] and that's what it's about the details
[766.56 - 770.48] so that was a little bit about b12 we've
[768.64 - 773.92] got more to talk about talking about the
[770.48 - 774.96] central nervous system so here's the key
[773.92 - 777.12] sugar
[774.96 - 779.36] takes the nutrients
[777.12 - 780.96] into our cells
[779.36 - 783.28] right
[780.96 - 786.40] insulin
[783.28 - 788.40] insulin's job the hormone insulins job
[786.40 - 791.28] is to take sugar
[788.40 - 794.16] in your bloodstream
[791.28 - 796.24] and bring it into the cells so you can
[794.16 - 798.08] stay alive
[796.24 - 799.60] because without sugar we die
[798.08 - 801.28] you guys know that right without sugar
[799.60 - 803.36] we die
[801.28 - 805.12] if we don't have a sugar
[803.36 - 806.48] that enters our cells
[805.12 - 808.24] we die
[806.48 - 811.28] our brain
[808.24 - 812.84] has to have sugar
[811.28 - 817.36] in 10
[812.84 - 819.92] seconds without sugar passing 10 seconds
[817.36 - 822.00] 5 seconds 8 seconds 12 seconds our brain
[819.92 - 824.40] starts to die
[822.00 - 826.08] so glucose is critical this is how we
[824.40 - 828.96] live right
[826.08 - 830.56] it's important to know okay
[828.96 - 832.64] why do you think a diabetic will go into
[830.56 - 834.00] a diabetic coma
[832.64 - 836.56] either something's wrong they don't have
[834.00 - 838.56] the insulin or they're out of insulin
[836.56 - 840.32] right or something's or they have
[838.56 - 842.16] another malfunction right
[840.32 - 844.24] the malfunction regardless is about
[842.16 - 846.48] glucose getting to the brain the sugar
[844.24 - 848.00] goes low to the brain
[846.48 - 849.84] and that's why a diabetic will be on the
[848.00 - 851.44] back of a bus or somewhere
[849.84 - 852.64] or they'll be in a bus somewhere or
[851.44 - 854.08] somewhere else and they're just going to
[852.64 - 855.36] be there like this passed out and
[854.08 - 856.72] they're seizuring
[855.36 - 857.92] then their tongue's hanging out of their
[856.72 - 859.20] mouth
[857.92 - 861.12] and then you've got to put a little
[859.20 - 862.88] orange juice in their mouth to just get
[861.12 - 864.40] them out of it a little bit regardless
[862.88 - 866.88] of where their insulin is i mean i've
[864.40 - 869.76] seen that happen so many times right so
[866.88 - 873.76] you have to get sugar to the brain
[869.76 - 874.56] so nutrients nutrients enter our cells
[873.76 - 876.72] through
[874.56 - 878.48] sugars is what they do
[876.72 - 880.48] a lot of people are so jacked up on high
[878.48 - 882.16] fat diets
[880.48 - 883.84] that they're throwing
[882.16 - 885.84] they're they're they're not
[883.84 - 888.40] like they're not getting the nutrients
[885.84 - 889.28] where they need to be so the b12 is one
[888.40 - 891.04] of them
[889.28 - 892.64] now i recommend i was telling a doctor
[891.04 - 894.08] the other day i still recommend even if
[892.64 - 895.44] somebody's on a high fat diet to make
[894.08 - 897.52] sure they get the right supplements in
[895.44 - 898.80] because they can sneak some in some will
[897.52 - 900.88] mean they'll sneak some of those
[898.80 - 902.56] nutrients into their cells it'll get
[900.88 - 904.88] there
[902.56 - 906.08] but for maximum healing you take
[904.88 - 908.48] somebody on mattress island with
[906.08 - 910.80] neurological problems that are suffering
[908.48 - 914.40] you lower their fats and you get the
[910.80 - 915.44] right b12 in them
[914.40 - 917.68] and
[915.44 - 920.16] you got a chance now
[917.68 - 921.60] every day i i think about it like how
[920.16 - 923.12] does anybody stand a chance of healing
[921.60 - 924.32] with the misinformation out there for
[923.12 - 926.56] one
[924.32 - 928.08] how many people are derailed
[926.56 - 930.32] from getting the right information so
[928.08 - 932.16] they don't even stand a chance to heal
[930.32 - 933.60] they'll never stand a chance to heal
[932.16 - 935.28] yeah you heard it from me they will
[933.60 - 937.04] never heal
[935.28 - 938.72] there's people out there that will never
[937.04 - 940.40] heal because
[938.72 - 942.16] the the information
[940.40 - 943.60] it's derailed before it even gets to
[942.16 - 946.48] them or they just don't learn it or
[943.60 - 948.32] there's so much misinformation out there
[946.48 - 950.00] they don't understand b12 or how it
[948.32 - 952.24] works they don't know about the right
[950.00 - 954.08] things they'll never heal
[952.24 - 956.08] they'll go to doctor doctor specialist
[954.08 - 957.92] especially should crown round around
[956.08 - 960.48] forever and they will never get their
[957.92 - 963.92] life back and that's sad
[960.48 - 963.92] that happens all the time
[965.28 - 969.04] so
[967.04 - 970.88] you know someone said the other day i
[969.04 - 972.80] think that they actually said the other
[970.88 - 974.64] day in the comments section right like
[972.80 - 977.52] oh there he goes with supplements again
[974.64 - 977.52] okay well okay
[978.00 - 981.12] okay
[979.60 - 983.52] it's better
[981.12 - 985.52] to know why you're sick and how to heal
[983.52 - 986.96] and supplements are a critical way of
[985.52 - 988.48] doing that
[986.96 - 990.72] or do you want to just keep on going
[988.48 - 993.60] around okay let me
[990.72 - 996.00] buy a 50 000 oxygen hyperbaric oxygen
[993.60 - 998.08] chamber which don't work they don't work
[996.00 - 999.76] they've been around forever
[998.08 - 1001.60] and people pouring into my office for
[999.76 - 1003.92] years i tried everything
[1001.60 - 1005.84] they purchased auction you know chambers
[1003.92 - 1006.88] all of it it's cute it's a great idea
[1005.84 - 1008.80] but no
[1006.88 - 1011.44] it doesn't work
[1008.80 - 1013.36] you know um go to another doctor and
[1011.44 - 1015.52] keep on pumping ozone therapy inside of
[1013.36 - 1017.92] you over and over and over again
[1015.52 - 1019.20] which i don't recommend
[1017.92 - 1021.52] you know
[1019.20 - 1023.20] keep on going around okay let's go cold
[1021.52 - 1025.68] punching now let's see if that can fix
[1023.20 - 1027.28] it all right let's go try a rife machine
[1025.68 - 1028.64] let's see if that will fix this how many
[1027.28 - 1031.04] times those things just ended up in
[1028.64 - 1032.08] people's closets it's
[1031.04 - 1035.36] and
[1032.08 - 1037.84] that crap gets expensive
[1035.36 - 1039.12] real expensive and it still doesn't fix
[1037.84 - 1041.20] things and that's what i mean over and
[1039.12 - 1042.72] over again oh grab an alkaline ionizer
[1041.20 - 1044.24] water machine and poison yourself it
[1042.72 - 1046.88] doesn't work
[1044.24 - 1048.96] let's get a 5 000 alkaline ionizer water
[1046.88 - 1049.84] machine let's do that
[1048.96 - 1051.52] right
[1049.84 - 1053.44] and
[1051.52 - 1057.20] people don't realize
[1053.44 - 1059.60] you know it's their simple
[1057.20 - 1062.40] strong basic details
[1059.60 - 1064.88] of how to get people out of the muck and
[1062.40 - 1067.76] out of the darkness and into the light
[1064.88 - 1069.76] of healing there's ways to do it
[1067.76 - 1072.56] and using the right supplementation is a
[1069.76 - 1074.64] critical way to do it it's part of it
[1072.56 - 1077.28] sabine said
[1074.64 - 1079.28] on facebook vimrgy b12 is great it works
[1077.28 - 1081.28] good i had a blood test after six months
[1079.28 - 1082.72] supplementing i recovered from a lot of
[1081.28 - 1085.12] problems with the heart right there
[1082.72 - 1086.32] anthony you are the right you are right
[1085.12 - 1089.52] with everything
[1086.32 - 1091.76] you were telling back in 2020
[1089.52 - 1093.68] i hope all listen good to what you and
[1091.76 - 1095.84] spirit and compassion have to say i
[1093.68 - 1098.00] recovered from diabetes type 2 sluggish
[1095.84 - 1099.60] liver heavy metal poisoning hashimoto's
[1098.00 - 1102.08] and epstein-barr
[1099.60 - 1103.92] is asleep again god bless you really
[1102.08 - 1106.80] sabine i'm so proud of you
[1103.92 - 1106.80] i truly am
[1106.84 - 1111.60] so we'll go into some more more about
[1110.00 - 1113.36] the supplements a little bit
[1111.60 - 1115.20] so cat's claw i want to talk about cat's
[1113.36 - 1118.16] cloth for a little bit so
[1115.20 - 1118.16] check this out you guys
[1118.40 - 1121.92] years ago
[1119.68 - 1123.60] years ago at different times in my life
[1121.92 - 1125.28] when i had an office and people all
[1123.60 - 1128.56] around the world came to see me
[1125.28 - 1131.52] recommended by their doctors okay
[1128.56 - 1132.88] right so let's just go back to any time
[1131.52 - 1136.00] frame i've been doing this which is
[1132.88 - 1139.04] decades since the 1990s people would
[1136.00 - 1141.04] come to my office
[1139.04 - 1142.88] right after seeing specialists after
[1141.04 - 1144.88] specialist after specialist not have a
[1142.88 - 1146.72] clue to why they were sick with their
[1144.88 - 1148.88] neurological symptoms and sickness and
[1146.72 - 1151.92] fatigue and everything right
[1148.88 - 1153.44] and i would have all these herbs on my
[1151.92 - 1156.32] shelf
[1153.44 - 1158.32] all these herbs
[1156.32 - 1160.24] and spirit of compassion would say they
[1158.32 - 1161.44] need cat's claw
[1160.24 - 1164.16] right
[1161.44 - 1165.04] so i'd go and get the glass jar off the
[1164.16 - 1167.44] shelf
[1165.04 - 1169.92] like this
[1167.44 - 1171.92] i would start up some tea
[1169.92 - 1174.48] right there in my office
[1171.92 - 1176.56] get some hot water going i'd get the
[1174.48 - 1178.56] cat's claw out and the cat's claw would
[1176.56 - 1181.04] be a dried cat's claw
[1178.56 - 1182.24] sitting in a glass
[1181.04 - 1185.60] jar
[1182.24 - 1187.36] i would take the cat's claw out
[1185.60 - 1190.56] and i would put it in the hot water and
[1187.36 - 1192.72] steep it right in front of the person
[1190.56 - 1194.96] and be like what's that okay it's cat's
[1192.72 - 1194.96] claw
[1195.12 - 1197.92] and then
[1196.16 - 1199.44] have them sip it
[1197.92 - 1200.32] right there
[1199.44 - 1201.36] and i
[1200.32 - 1204.72] i
[1201.36 - 1207.28] and it wasn't the best cat's claw
[1204.72 - 1209.28] it was survival
[1207.28 - 1211.52] cat's claw
[1209.28 - 1213.12] it helped
[1211.52 - 1214.96] it was amazing
[1213.12 - 1218.24] that i had some
[1214.96 - 1220.24] no one knew about it
[1218.24 - 1222.72] and when i think about where we are
[1220.24 - 1224.56] today when like the cat's claw that's in
[1222.72 - 1227.28] my hands right now
[1224.56 - 1229.52] if i had this back then
[1227.28 - 1231.84] i could have speeded up so many people's
[1229.52 - 1234.24] healing processes
[1231.84 - 1236.96] yeah it helped him when i took the cat's
[1234.24 - 1238.64] claw out of the glass jar and i made
[1236.96 - 1244.32] them a cat's claw tee right there in my
[1238.64 - 1246.16] office whether it's 1994 or 1997 or 1999
[1244.32 - 1247.44] at different times in different people
[1246.16 - 1249.28] when spirit of compassion said this
[1247.44 - 1250.80] would be really good for them and it was
[1249.28 - 1252.40] beneficial
[1250.80 - 1254.00] and their doctor would call me up their
[1252.40 - 1256.80] doctor would come to my office the
[1254.00 - 1259.84] doctor would sit there
[1256.80 - 1260.72] and even as far as back as the 80s
[1259.84 - 1264.24] right
[1260.72 - 1264.24] and so the point is
[1264.32 - 1268.80] that if i had something like this at my
[1267.44 - 1271.36] ready
[1268.80 - 1273.36] at their ready
[1271.36 - 1274.96] i could have gotten so many more people
[1273.36 - 1276.72] faster
[1274.96 - 1279.04] and you know because it took more time
[1276.72 - 1280.80] to use the dry cat's claw the best stuff
[1279.04 - 1282.80] i could find at the time back all the
[1280.80 - 1283.60] way decades ago
[1282.80 - 1286.72] and
[1283.60 - 1288.64] i didn't have the option so what i what
[1286.72 - 1290.08] i realized in the supplement world is
[1288.64 - 1292.00] there's so much crap out there and
[1290.08 - 1294.88] there's so much
[1292.00 - 1296.96] just junk and misinformation
[1294.88 - 1298.88] and i think about it you know that
[1296.96 - 1300.56] people they don't even know they just
[1298.88 - 1301.60] take things for granted they don't even
[1300.56 - 1304.72] know
[1301.60 - 1307.28] like what what kind of blessings we have
[1304.72 - 1309.12] that we're so lucky to have here if i
[1307.28 - 1311.68] was suffering from neurological lyme
[1309.12 - 1313.52] myself personally if i had all these
[1311.68 - 1315.60] this fatigue and aches and pains and i
[1313.52 - 1317.36] had tingles and numbness and i was
[1315.60 - 1318.56] suffering and i had inflammation
[1317.36 - 1320.08] throughout my body and i had
[1318.56 - 1322.72] neurological symptoms because of the
[1320.08 - 1324.16] epstein-barr virus because that's behind
[1322.72 - 1326.00] that's actually behind neurological
[1324.16 - 1329.60] lines shingles doesn't help either and
[1326.00 - 1331.12] say i had all these viral issues
[1329.60 - 1333.12] right
[1331.12 - 1336.24] and i had something at the ready at this
[1333.12 - 1338.80] my at my disposal like this and a
[1336.24 - 1340.88] quality like this
[1338.80 - 1342.48] i mean it's just a miracle is what i'm
[1340.88 - 1344.40] trying to say
[1342.48 - 1346.56] and that's that's the kind of thing that
[1344.40 - 1348.56] counts that's the cat's claw right there
[1346.56 - 1350.64] so with cat's claw
[1348.56 - 1353.52] and i tell doctors all the time
[1350.64 - 1355.36] is your patient on cat's claw
[1353.52 - 1357.84] and they'll be like well well i don't
[1355.36 - 1359.44] know there was a cat's call capsule that
[1357.84 - 1360.96] i could always try to get them on or
[1359.44 - 1361.92] something like that
[1360.96 - 1364.32] be like
[1361.92 - 1366.16] that's not that's not the answer
[1364.32 - 1367.12] i want to hear your patience on cat's
[1366.16 - 1369.36] claw
[1367.12 - 1370.72] if you want to get your patients better
[1369.36 - 1372.64] you know when it comes down to the
[1370.72 - 1374.24] neurological line neurological symptoms
[1372.64 - 1376.08] you don't even have to have a lyme tag
[1374.24 - 1377.68] it's autoimmune
[1376.08 - 1378.64] just autoimmune
[1377.68 - 1380.24] right
[1378.64 - 1382.48] and then it matters about the right kind
[1380.24 - 1384.56] of cat's claw someone will have a cat's
[1382.48 - 1388.40] claw it'll just have alcohol in it it'll
[1384.56 - 1390.56] be ripped to shreds inside the nutrients
[1388.40 - 1392.00] it can constitute all the nutrients
[1390.56 - 1394.48] would be literally
[1392.00 - 1396.80] damaged from the alcohol
[1394.48 - 1399.60] and so you'll have all these issues
[1396.80 - 1401.44] with the different cats claws out there
[1399.60 - 1403.52] or dehydrated
[1401.44 - 1407.28] capsulated
[1403.52 - 1410.16] cat's claw it just doesn't work right
[1407.28 - 1412.16] and the low potency and the low ratio
[1410.16 - 1414.00] and the low low quality all of it
[1412.16 - 1415.20] combined with the fillers and everything
[1414.00 - 1416.72] else
[1415.20 - 1419.60] basically what happens when we have
[1416.72 - 1421.52] something at our disposal and
[1419.60 - 1422.56] let me make something clear right here
[1421.52 - 1425.12] right now
[1422.56 - 1427.76] medical meeting information and tools is
[1425.12 - 1430.24] as basic as just celery juice
[1427.76 - 1431.36] and see how your problems go away
[1430.24 - 1432.88] they're not going away and they're
[1431.36 - 1435.04] sticking and you're only getting some
[1432.88 - 1437.36] things better you stay with your celery
[1435.04 - 1439.20] and then we move forward
[1437.36 - 1441.44] and then it's now the heavy metal detox
[1439.20 - 1442.96] smoothie i'm cleaning things up but if
[1441.44 - 1444.80] you're somebody that's got
[1442.96 - 1447.20] a lot of bugs and see you've got the
[1444.80 - 1450.72] shingles and the cmv and you got the ebv
[1447.20 - 1452.56] and you got the hh v6 and you're sick
[1450.72 - 1454.72] and you got the streptococcus causing
[1452.56 - 1458.40] all kinds of acne and crazy stuff and
[1454.72 - 1460.40] utis with it all if you're sick
[1458.40 - 1461.84] it may not just be celery juice being
[1460.40 - 1464.96] enough for you
[1461.84 - 1466.96] i've never been one to jump in heavy in
[1464.96 - 1468.56] anything in the sense where you got to
[1466.96 - 1470.24] do all these supplements and this is
[1468.56 - 1471.52] what you got to do no start with celery
[1470.24 - 1474.24] juice is fine
[1471.52 - 1477.20] but just don't complain that you're not
[1474.24 - 1479.04] getting better and you've tried mmm and
[1477.20 - 1481.04] you did it all when you didn't and you
[1479.04 - 1484.56] just did some celery juice because
[1481.04 - 1487.28] there's so many more places you can go
[1484.56 - 1490.48] so many more directions you can go into
[1487.28 - 1492.64] customizing so it's like
[1490.48 - 1494.72] you can start as at the beginning with
[1492.64 - 1497.44] celery juice but you know the cat's
[1494.72 - 1499.44] claws here if you're really struggling
[1497.44 - 1501.84] let's see hannah says i take cat's claw
[1499.44 - 1504.56] among other ones you have here they are
[1501.84 - 1507.20] really moving the needle for me my fibro
[1504.56 - 1508.16] has reduced immensely so what happens
[1507.20 - 1510.56] with
[1508.16 - 1511.92] lexi what happens with fibro is you're
[1510.56 - 1512.96] dealing with the epstein-barr virus
[1511.92 - 1514.40] right
[1512.96 - 1515.84] i talk about that and i teach that to
[1514.40 - 1517.28] doctors all the time see i've seen bar
[1515.84 - 1519.12] virus creating fibromyalgia that's
[1517.28 - 1521.60] original medical medium information now
[1519.12 - 1524.24] science is talking about that now
[1521.60 - 1526.08] and that's medical medium signs versus
[1524.24 - 1528.08] that stuff out there so science is now
[1526.08 - 1530.24] talking about hey epstein bars you know
[1528.08 - 1532.00] creates fibromyalgia now
[1530.24 - 1535.28] cat's claw
[1532.00 - 1535.28] synapsing bar killer
[1535.44 - 1540.80] epstein bar creates neurological lyme fc
[1538.16 - 1542.40] bar creates multiple sclerosis
[1540.80 - 1544.00] and just so you know all those articles
[1542.40 - 1546.56] you see out there now about epstein-barr
[1544.00 - 1548.96] creating ms i published it seven years
[1546.56 - 1548.96] before
[1549.28 - 1554.00] seven years before it was published okay
[1551.84 - 1556.72] about the cause of multiple sclerosis
[1554.00 - 1558.08] and taught years before that by me and
[1556.72 - 1559.92] lectures
[1558.08 - 1561.76] and and teaching doctors and so forth
[1559.92 - 1563.12] about the cause of ms but the point is
[1561.76 - 1565.20] with any symptoms you may be somebody
[1563.12 - 1566.32] that's like i don't have ms aw i don't
[1565.20 - 1568.72] have
[1566.32 - 1571.04] neurological lyme a doctor says you know
[1568.72 - 1572.08] i might have autoimmune
[1571.04 - 1574.32] yeah
[1572.08 - 1576.16] you got the autoimmune or you've got
[1574.32 - 1577.28] your symptoms whatever symptoms those
[1576.16 - 1578.88] are
[1577.28 - 1581.76] so cat's cause one of those things where
[1578.88 - 1584.80] i've always seen this as a miracle
[1581.76 - 1586.88] i i saw it as a miracle going back years
[1584.80 - 1589.60] ago in my office when i would take the
[1586.88 - 1592.24] dried cat's claw out and make the person
[1589.60 - 1593.68] a tea right there
[1592.24 - 1595.68] and they would sit there and they'd be
[1593.68 - 1597.12] sipping this cat's claw or they'd be
[1595.68 - 1601.84] sitting there with their doctor and
[1597.12 - 1601.84] they're both sipping the cat's claw
[1602.88 - 1606.48] and
[1604.24 - 1608.40] if i knew because you know everybody's
[1606.48 - 1609.84] at their own free will the world has its
[1608.40 - 1612.96] own free will
[1609.84 - 1615.36] if i knew years and years later
[1612.96 - 1617.60] that we'd have a cat's claw
[1615.36 - 1620.00] at the ready in our hand
[1617.60 - 1622.72] that's better than anything i've used
[1620.00 - 1624.96] all these years i just i'd be blown away
[1622.72 - 1626.80] and i am blown away
[1624.96 - 1628.96] definitely now we have stronger bugs
[1626.80 - 1630.48] today too than we did years before and
[1628.96 - 1632.00] that's a problem we're up against we've
[1630.48 - 1634.48] got stronger bugs we've got stronger
[1632.00 - 1636.56] ebv's we got stronger shingles we got
[1634.48 - 1638.72] more toxic heavy metals we cut more
[1636.56 - 1641.04] chemicals we're up against all the time
[1638.72 - 1643.20] so we're up against more than we ever
[1641.04 - 1646.00] were up against before so what that
[1643.20 - 1649.12] means is oh my blood tests just fine
[1646.00 - 1651.84] with my b12 i don't need any b12
[1649.12 - 1654.64] the doctor said my blood test is fine
[1651.84 - 1657.04] the world has changed
[1654.64 - 1659.76] did you know that the level that they
[1657.04 - 1662.88] actually depict as being fine
[1659.76 - 1666.08] the window of where the b12 needs to be
[1662.88 - 1670.72] on the blood test is from the 1920s
[1666.08 - 1672.48] did you know that the 1920s
[1670.72 - 1674.08] so everybody's walking around now with
[1672.48 - 1676.08] all kinds of different elevated al
[1674.08 - 1677.84] epstein bars they got the herpes simplex
[1676.08 - 1680.84] one and two they get cytomegalovirus
[1677.84 - 1682.40] they got hpv they got hiv they got
[1680.84 - 1683.76] aids
[1682.40 - 1684.96] they're walking around with all this
[1683.76 - 1687.20] stuff
[1684.96 - 1690.00] toxic heavy metals lots of chemicals and
[1687.20 - 1693.20] we're using the b12 level
[1690.00 - 1694.16] that was a theory as being the right b12
[1693.20 - 1697.76] level
[1694.16 - 1698.72] in 1920. so what you see on your blood
[1697.76 - 1702.72] work
[1698.72 - 1706.00] is 1920s depiction of a group of doctors
[1702.72 - 1707.20] in in the science world in 1920
[1706.00 - 1709.84] that
[1707.20 - 1712.48] believe that was where the b12 level
[1709.84 - 1715.68] should be at and that's what we we rely
[1712.48 - 1718.40] on we rely on something from 1920 from
[1715.68 - 1720.16] guesswork to where your b12 needs to be
[1718.40 - 1722.56] on blood on the blood test
[1720.16 - 1724.64] not to what we're up against today in
[1722.56 - 1727.20] the world we're up against fighting what
[1724.64 - 1729.28] we're fighting against
[1727.20 - 1731.44] trying to heal people on mattress island
[1729.28 - 1733.28] everybody falling ill we know how
[1731.44 - 1736.40] everybody's falling ill now and getting
[1733.28 - 1737.92] there and so with all that in the flues
[1736.40 - 1740.00] too that we're up against now and
[1737.92 - 1742.08] everything else that we keep on getting
[1740.00 - 1744.16] hit with
[1742.08 - 1746.96] that we're going to then go by the
[1744.16 - 1748.80] gold standard of 1920 from some
[1746.96 - 1750.80] guesswork that that's where your b12
[1748.80 - 1752.96] level is supposed to be at and if you do
[1750.80 - 1754.88] go by that fine
[1752.96 - 1756.72] but is it even getting into the cells
[1754.88 - 1759.04] it's another thing too so anyways going
[1756.72 - 1760.64] back to the 5mthf right
[1759.04 - 1763.60] so that's the methylfolate right there
[1760.64 - 1764.96] it helps with the methylation so
[1763.60 - 1767.60] the incredible thing about like the
[1764.96 - 1770.24] vimergy products like the vimergy b12 it
[1767.60 - 1772.64] needs less of the
[1770.24 - 1775.28] methylation that's what's amazing right
[1772.64 - 1778.16] there right it needs less
[1775.28 - 1780.00] of methylation other b12s that won't
[1778.16 - 1781.84] even get into cells there's so many
[1780.00 - 1784.64] b-12s out of there that won't even budge
[1781.84 - 1786.40] into cells right the vimergy b12 is the
[1784.64 - 1788.40] right blend of adenosine cobalamin and
[1786.40 - 1790.24] methylcobalamin and then when you and
[1788.40 - 1792.48] that alone
[1790.24 - 1794.32] actually beats out methylation issues
[1792.48 - 1796.88] but then if you're somebody that had all
[1794.32 - 1798.16] these b12 shots and all these issues
[1796.88 - 1801.44] you might want to ask your doctor hey
[1798.16 - 1802.80] can i take the methyl methylfolate right
[1801.44 - 1804.72] and this is the stuff that i recommend
[1802.80 - 1806.24] friends and family people who come to me
[1804.72 - 1808.40] doctors that talk to me about stuff like
[1806.24 - 1809.60] that so let's move on to something else
[1808.40 - 1810.72] so i'm just talking about a couple of
[1809.60 - 1813.28] these things right there let's talk
[1810.72 - 1815.76] about melatonin
[1813.28 - 1815.76] right here
[1815.84 - 1820.32] so on youtube
[1818.00 - 1822.88] okay venislav says
[1820.32 - 1824.48] i healed from a tough ear infection
[1822.88 - 1827.12] after three months on medical medium
[1824.48 - 1830.32] protocols and lifestyles lifestyle thank
[1827.12 - 1832.40] you aw and soc this this is life saving
[1830.32 - 1834.08] amazing honor to have you here truly and
[1832.40 - 1836.00] i'm glad you're doing better and feeling
[1834.08 - 1838.32] so much better so i'm talking about
[1836.00 - 1841.12] melatonin right now
[1838.32 - 1842.40] melatonin is really interesting okay
[1841.12 - 1844.56] because first of all
[1842.40 - 1848.08] it's an antioxidant and that's what it
[1844.56 - 1849.68] is but an antioxidant that goes to the
[1848.08 - 1852.48] brain
[1849.68 - 1855.04] which is why i like melatonin right
[1852.48 - 1857.04] so one of the things about melatonin
[1855.04 - 1859.04] i'll show your brain right here
[1857.04 - 1861.28] one of the things i like is it slows
[1859.04 - 1863.36] down angiogenesis
[1861.28 - 1866.96] right so it slows down
[1863.36 - 1869.92] blood vessels growing from growths blood
[1866.96 - 1872.56] vessels growing from tumors and cysts
[1869.92 - 1875.52] and growths and stuff like that okay so
[1872.56 - 1877.36] i really really love melatonin for that
[1875.52 - 1880.16] reason alone but for mental health
[1877.36 - 1882.56] conditions i love melatonin greatly
[1880.16 - 1885.20] because it is an antioxidant
[1882.56 - 1888.32] that has a different access to the brain
[1885.20 - 1891.20] and brain stem so antioxidants all
[1888.32 - 1893.04] antioxidants have a different pathway
[1891.20 - 1896.48] into our body
[1893.04 - 1900.64] an antioxidant from one source
[1896.48 - 1902.00] a polyphenol anthocyanin from one source
[1900.64 - 1903.68] will enter
[1902.00 - 1905.12] the body in a different way organs in
[1903.68 - 1908.32] the body and glands in a different way
[1905.12 - 1910.16] than some other antioxidant source will
[1908.32 - 1911.92] do when it comes down to a hormone
[1910.16 - 1913.92] antioxidant like
[1911.92 - 1917.12] melatonin
[1913.92 - 1919.84] a brain hormone antioxidant it's easy
[1917.12 - 1922.40] access through blood brain barrier it's
[1919.84 - 1923.76] easy access and that's what i love about
[1922.40 - 1925.60] it okay
[1923.76 - 1927.84] audrey's antler says but doesn't
[1925.60 - 1930.16] melatonin mess up your hormones it does
[1927.84 - 1931.44] not has nothing to do with estrogen has
[1930.16 - 1933.76] nothing to do
[1931.44 - 1935.76] with anything of that sore has nothing
[1933.76 - 1938.48] to do with testosterone
[1935.76 - 1940.56] has nothing to do with epinephrine has
[1938.48 - 1942.24] nothing to do with adrenal hormones has
[1940.56 - 1944.32] nothing to do with thyroid hormones or
[1942.24 - 1945.44] any of the sort or any of that there is
[1944.32 - 1946.72] no
[1945.44 - 1949.44] science
[1946.72 - 1952.32] that has showcased that it does
[1949.44 - 1954.40] okay that was an attack a while back on
[1952.32 - 1957.84] melatonin because melatonin is very
[1954.40 - 1959.04] helpful for a word i can't say on here
[1957.84 - 1962.72] so
[1959.04 - 1964.00] because melatonin is helpful for a word
[1962.72 - 1966.13] that
[1964.00 - 1967.76] sounds like answer
[1966.13 - 1970.32] [Music]
[1967.76 - 1973.84] because melatonin
[1970.32 - 1973.84] is helpful for answer
[1974.48 - 1978.88] it it has been attacked and some of the
[1977.28 - 1980.08] sabotage has been things like that oh
[1978.88 - 1982.00] it'll mess up your hormones which it
[1980.08 - 1984.32] doesn't oh it'll do this which it
[1982.00 - 1988.56] doesn't
[1984.32 - 1988.56] because it's good for answer
[1988.80 - 1992.56] you know answering the phone

[2044.16 - 2049.52] i didn't count how many i didn't count
[2046.16 - 2049.52] whatever that's what i did
[2051.44 - 2054.96] you're somebody that
[2053.36 - 2057.60] is interested in melatonin ask your
[2054.96 - 2059.28] doctor what's right for you

[2089.68 - 2094.72] right deep sadness so no one knows why
[2092.40 - 2097.12] they're sad okay the feeling of being
[2094.72 - 2097.84] lost a feeling of being kind of out of
[2097.12 - 2099.84] it
[2097.84 - 2102.40] a feeling of being like disconnected
[2099.84 - 2104.80] like you need to be someplace else
[2102.40 - 2106.88] a feeling of having anxiousness anxiety
[2104.80 - 2108.72] all that with it
[2106.88 - 2110.88] a feeling i feel like that you got meant
[2108.72 - 2113.12] like memory loss like a feeling of like
[2110.88 - 2114.96] am i losing my memory or sensation like
[2113.12 - 2116.56] am i losing my memory
[2114.96 - 2120.08] anything like that or if you have memory
[2116.56 - 2122.00] issues adhd right autism all of it
[2120.08 - 2124.32] sylvia says if you're healthy why would
[2122.00 - 2126.56] you take that many melatonin because i
[2124.32 - 2128.48] do something i don't recommend anybody
[2126.56 - 2129.44] else to do
[2128.48 - 2133.60] is
[2129.44 - 2135.04] i am making a special surprise
[2133.60 - 2136.80] an
[2135.04 - 2138.32] announcement
[2136.80 - 2141.84] i'm hoping
[2138.32 - 2141.84] the beginning of this week coming up
[2142.16 - 2147.36] and i'm excited so i got to surprise you
[2144.56 - 2149.20] guys beginning this week but anyway
[2147.36 - 2150.64] the point is is the reason why like why
[2149.20 - 2153.68] would i take this much if i don't have a
[2150.64 - 2156.96] health problem because i burn the candle
[2153.68 - 2159.12] at four ends i work 20 hour days i work
[2156.96 - 2162.32] 22 hour days
[2159.12 - 2164.16] i work 18 hour days 19 hour days i work
[2162.32 - 2166.80] seven days a week i haven't taken a
[2164.16 - 2168.24] vacation in decades
[2166.80 - 2170.40] so
[2168.24 - 2172.32] that's what i do
[2170.40 - 2174.16] i work for god i work for the
[2172.32 - 2176.48] chronically ill
[2174.16 - 2177.84] i don't work for myself
[2176.48 - 2180.56] i work for god and i work for the
[2177.84 - 2183.36] chronically ill and when you do that
[2180.56 - 2186.08] you don't put yourself first
[2183.36 - 2188.00] so i don't do self-care i want everybody
[2186.08 - 2189.28] else to do self-care i want you guys to
[2188.00 - 2192.40] be into self-care i want you to take
[2189.28 - 2193.76] care of yourselves it's critical okay
[2192.40 - 2196.48] but
[2193.76 - 2197.92] what i do is something different
[2196.48 - 2199.28] so
[2197.92 - 2201.60] i push
[2199.28 - 2204.72] the pedal to the metal
[2201.60 - 2204.72] i step on the gas
[2204.96 - 2209.28] and i drive fast in life
[2207.28 - 2211.68] not literally in a car because driving
[2209.28 - 2214.32] fast is bad in a car don't do it
[2211.68 - 2217.92] the bottom line is so what i like to do
[2214.32 - 2219.60] is i like to protect myself because
[2217.92 - 2221.92] if anybody actually looked at my
[2219.60 - 2224.56] schedule and looked at my life and saw
[2221.92 - 2227.92] in my personal life how hard i work and
[2224.56 - 2230.40] how many years and how and what i do
[2227.92 - 2231.84] they would be scared for my life
[2230.40 - 2234.16] and so what i do because spirit
[2231.84 - 2236.00] compassion says take care of yourself
[2234.16 - 2238.64] make sure you're getting that
[2236.00 - 2241.12] antioxidant in your brain make sure your
[2238.64 - 2243.28] your b12 is cranked up because of what
[2241.12 - 2245.76] you do make sure you take care of
[2243.28 - 2245.76] yourself
[2246.88 - 2250.88] so that's what i do i try to take care
[2248.80 - 2253.04] of myself where i can like the easiest
[2250.88 - 2255.20] way i can so what brand of melatonin
[2253.04 - 2258.36] roxanne says that's vimergy
[2255.20 - 2261.60] it's v is in victor i m as in mary
[2258.36 - 2263.68] e-r-g-y you'll see the label right there
[2261.60 - 2266.96] vimorji
[2263.68 - 2268.16] vimorji.com i'm not sponsored
[2266.96 - 2270.64] right
[2268.16 - 2272.72] and i don't own vimergy i'm not the
[2270.64 - 2274.72] owner of the company it's just the best
[2272.72 - 2277.52] stuff there is
[2274.72 - 2280.40] hands down it's the best does it make a
[2277.52 - 2282.08] difference when you have good stuff
[2280.40 - 2284.80] it makes a difference
[2282.08 - 2286.40] huge one it moves the needle and that's
[2284.80 - 2287.60] the difference right there
[2286.40 - 2289.04] so
[2287.60 - 2290.24] talk about ashwagandha for a couple of
[2289.04 - 2292.48] minutes i know that
[2290.24 - 2294.24] we have a crisis right now with women in
[2292.48 - 2296.16] in hair loss
[2294.24 - 2297.36] um samantha half says are you paid by
[2296.16 - 2300.48] vibrancy
[2297.36 - 2301.68] i am not sponsored i don't have that
[2300.48 - 2304.24] thing where you know people get
[2301.68 - 2305.84] sponsored so they get what is it like
[2304.24 - 2307.28] they get paid because they're sponsored
[2305.84 - 2310.80] and all that stuff so no i'm not paid by
[2307.28 - 2310.80] the energy so um
[2310.96 - 2314.00] yeah i'm not the owner of energy i don't
[2312.56 - 2316.40] i'm not a uh
[2314.00 - 2318.16] you know a part owner of energy or
[2316.40 - 2320.56] nothing so
[2318.16 - 2321.44] i'm not an ambassador
[2320.56 - 2323.28] so
[2321.44 - 2326.40] i'm not an ambassador so i don't get
[2323.28 - 2328.00] paid as an ambassador i'm not a whatever
[2326.40 - 2329.60] whatever the people are with all that
[2328.00 - 2332.48] they get sponsored their ambassadors and
[2329.60 - 2334.08] all that stuff to everything no
[2332.48 - 2336.88] it's just the most powerful stuff that
[2334.08 - 2338.88] i've found that i like for my friends
[2336.88 - 2340.32] and family i recommend the doctors and
[2338.88 - 2341.92] of course i tell you guys about it all
[2340.32 - 2344.08] the time
[2341.92 - 2345.60] elsie said you should be paid that's
[2344.08 - 2347.28] funny so this is the ashwagandha in my
[2345.60 - 2348.16] hands right now
[2347.28 - 2350.72] so i want to tell you about the
[2348.16 - 2354.00] ashwagandha so there's a wave right now
[2350.72 - 2356.32] okay of hair loss for women
[2354.00 - 2357.60] massive wave of hair loss for women and
[2356.32 - 2358.88] that's where we're heading into this
[2357.60 - 2361.20] world we're heading into a world where
[2358.88 - 2363.52] that's going to be more and more
[2361.20 - 2364.96] obvious happening in people's lives
[2363.52 - 2366.32] doctors are going to be hearing about it
[2364.96 - 2367.84] all the time
[2366.32 - 2369.84] so
[2367.84 - 2372.96] what i love about
[2369.84 - 2375.12] ashwagandha is ashwagandha does help the
[2372.96 - 2377.84] adrenals and it helps
[2375.12 - 2380.40] the adrenals restore
[2377.84 - 2381.60] which is a big part of why women have
[2380.40 - 2383.20] hair loss
[2381.60 - 2385.20] so
[2383.20 - 2387.44] so when it comes down to your adrenals
[2385.20 - 2389.44] they get weak and there's dosages in the
[2387.44 - 2390.96] book on that too like if you know if you
[2389.44 - 2392.24] have a cleanse to heal here's a cleanse
[2390.96 - 2393.76] the heel right here i show you the
[2392.24 - 2395.12] dosages and all that and cleanse the
[2393.76 - 2397.20] heel
[2395.12 - 2399.20] so in this life right here with the
[2397.20 - 2402.16] stress that women are under
[2399.20 - 2403.84] and men too and men too but the stress
[2402.16 - 2404.64] that women are under
[2403.84 - 2408.16] right
[2404.64 - 2411.04] like women's hair follicles depend on
[2408.16 - 2414.16] how strong their adrenals are because
[2411.04 - 2416.72] there's a hormone in their adrenal blend
[2414.16 - 2418.72] that keeps the hair follicle healthy and
[2416.72 - 2419.60] alive
[2418.72 - 2421.20] so
[2419.60 - 2423.68] when
[2421.20 - 2425.68] and you don't even have to have fatigue
[2423.68 - 2428.08] to have an adrenal problem you could be
[2425.68 - 2430.80] missing one of the adrenal hormones
[2428.08 - 2432.40] or be really low on it and then the hair
[2430.80 - 2433.68] starts falling out so if you're
[2432.40 - 2435.12] especially if you're up against stress
[2433.68 - 2437.84] or any kind of
[2435.12 - 2439.52] any kind of emotional
[2437.84 - 2442.80] so what happens is with a lot of women
[2439.52 - 2445.20] is they'll have a difficult relationship
[2442.80 - 2447.76] difficult friendship they'll have
[2445.20 - 2450.00] you know financial stress they'll have
[2447.76 - 2452.00] a divorce they'll have
[2450.00 - 2455.04] all kinds of other issues that happen in
[2452.00 - 2456.72] their life and then a year later the
[2455.04 - 2459.36] hair just starts pouring off their head
[2456.72 - 2461.52] like it's just coming out in droves it's
[2459.36 - 2463.36] in the shower it's on the shower floor
[2461.52 - 2465.12] it's everywhere it's in their hands and
[2463.36 - 2466.64] they brush it they just brush their hair
[2465.12 - 2468.48] and it's just filled and filling the
[2466.64 - 2470.16] brush and it's this
[2468.48 - 2472.48] it's like what feels to be like a
[2470.16 - 2474.08] tragedy as they're pulling out all the
[2472.48 - 2476.56] hair out of their brush and they have
[2474.08 - 2478.32] hair all over their sink and it becomes
[2476.56 - 2480.80] this thing where that all of a sudden
[2478.32 - 2483.04] becomes tremendous amounts of ptsd and
[2480.80 - 2486.32] stress as hair is just going everywhere
[2483.04 - 2487.76] and falling everywhere so
[2486.32 - 2489.20] family member reached out to me that has
[2487.76 - 2491.12] a best friend the best friend's just
[2489.20 - 2494.00] losing all their hair and she's just
[2491.12 - 2496.08] losing it's everywhere and like aw what
[2494.00 - 2497.68] do i do it's like ashwagandha that's the
[2496.08 - 2500.08] first thing make sure you've got enough
[2497.68 - 2501.36] ashwagandha
[2500.08 - 2504.08] and she was like well no i tried
[2501.36 - 2505.28] ashwagandha she tried ashwagandha well
[2504.08 - 2506.96] what kind
[2505.28 - 2509.12] and she was doing these ashwagandha
[2506.96 - 2510.72] capsules
[2509.12 - 2513.04] and then she switched and she used this
[2510.72 - 2514.24] ashwagandha and the hair started to slow
[2513.04 - 2516.24] down
[2514.24 - 2518.00] so it does make a difference when it's
[2516.24 - 2519.76] the right stuff right
[2518.00 - 2521.12] that's one another thing i said are you
[2519.76 - 2524.00] on b12
[2521.12 - 2526.80] like well there's b12 in my multivitamin
[2524.00 - 2528.88] so what this family member's friend said
[2526.80 - 2531.44] to me is there's b12 in their
[2528.88 - 2533.52] multivitamin and that should be enough
[2531.44 - 2535.28] and there's b12 in their hair skin and
[2533.52 - 2538.48] nails vitamin and that should be enough
[2535.28 - 2540.48] i said it's not enough it's not enough
[2538.48 - 2542.80] it's that much b12 and it's not even a
[2540.48 - 2545.20] good quality one so the b12 in the
[2542.80 - 2547.76] multivitamin is just only a smidgen it's
[2545.20 - 2549.60] not even a good one
[2547.76 - 2552.56] and it's just not enough
[2549.60 - 2555.36] well what do you suggest a w
[2552.56 - 2557.68] boom four dropper fulls of b12 a day two
[2555.36 - 2559.52] dropper holes twice a day and you do
[2557.68 - 2561.68] your ashwagandha
[2559.52 - 2563.44] and then boom less hair was falling out
[2561.68 - 2565.20] less hair was falling out and then it
[2563.44 - 2567.04] stopped
[2565.20 - 2568.80] and this person's hair was just falling
[2567.04 - 2570.40] out for quite a while and they went to
[2568.80 - 2571.76] all their functional medicine doctors
[2570.40 - 2573.60] and they were trying this and they're on
[2571.76 - 2576.96] hair skin nail formulas and they were
[2573.60 - 2578.96] doing this and it wasn't enough
[2576.96 - 2581.60] so anyway talking about ashwagandha for
[2578.96 - 2582.80] the adrenals strengthening the adrenals
[2581.60 - 2585.76] right
[2582.80 - 2587.92] i take ashwagandha i take it every night
[2585.76 - 2590.16] so what i do with ashwagandha
[2587.92 - 2590.16] right
[2590.84 - 2596.16] is do three dropper falls now with b12
[2594.32 - 2597.84] you don't have to do it in your mouth
[2596.16 - 2599.12] you can do it in water and have it in
[2597.84 - 2600.64] shot glass i'm just letting you guys
[2599.12 - 2602.24] know a lot of people are like well what
[2600.64 - 2603.60] about the b12 just put it in your mouth
[2602.24 - 2605.28] have it under your tongue you don't have
[2603.60 - 2607.20] to it's a bunch of dropper folds right
[2605.28 - 2609.36] there of ashwagandha
[2607.20 - 2609.36] so
[2609.68 - 2612.72] that's what i'll do at night
[2611.60 - 2615.04] right
[2612.72 - 2617.60] but i love that question why am i taking
[2615.04 - 2618.48] anything if nothing's wrong with me
[2617.60 - 2620.56] well
[2618.48 - 2622.88] i think if someone and i had a doctor
[2620.56 - 2625.84] tell me this a surgeon said that the
[2622.88 - 2628.72] hours i work if they did those hours
[2625.84 - 2631.20] they would literally need a sabbatical
[2628.72 - 2633.68] a year off so what i like to do is i
[2631.20 - 2636.96] like to keep the engine going so i use
[2633.68 - 2639.52] all the good stuff to do it
[2636.96 - 2641.04] i take all the good stuff away take away
[2639.52 - 2643.36] the cleanses the the medical mean
[2641.04 - 2645.20] cleanses that i like to do take away the
[2643.36 - 2647.04] mono eating cleanse which i love to do
[2645.20 - 2648.56] every now and then switch off and do
[2647.04 - 2651.12] that take away
[2648.56 - 2652.32] spirit of compassion's information

[2655.44 - 2661.52] me on some just plant-based diet
[2658.24 - 2663.92] or a keto diet animal protein take away
[2661.52 - 2666.08] you know all all my access to all the
[2663.92 - 2668.32] best stuff and supplements and yeah if
[2666.08 - 2670.72] i'm doing 20 hours a day i could start
[2668.32 - 2672.96] probably getting some problems
[2670.72 - 2675.04] you know like adrenals can start getting
[2672.96 - 2676.88] worn down and beat up central nervous
[2675.04 - 2678.16] system needs fuel i mean you know so
[2676.88 - 2679.92] it's all these things that are so
[2678.16 - 2681.20] critical take away my celery juice and
[2679.92 - 2683.84] yeah
[2681.20 - 2685.60] i'm a human being and if you work 20
[2683.84 - 2687.28] hours a day and you push
[2685.60 - 2689.36] push
[2687.28 - 2692.00] push it that hard you can actually get
[2689.36 - 2693.76] yourself in trouble so i do my 32 ounces
[2692.00 - 2696.00] of celery juice every single morning i
[2693.76 - 2697.76] do my heavy metal detox smoothie because
[2696.00 - 2699.84] we're always getting all kinds of
[2697.76 - 2701.68] you know contamination with heavy metals
[2699.84 - 2702.88] everywhere it's in the air it's
[2701.68 - 2704.64] everywhere
[2702.88 - 2706.64] you know if i stop doing my heavy metal
[2704.64 - 2708.64] detox smoothie and my celery juice and i
[2706.64 - 2711.04] stop doing the things that protect me
[2708.64 - 2713.28] and the b12 that i take every day and
[2711.04 - 2714.32] the propolis and the zinc
[2713.28 - 2715.84] right
[2714.32 - 2717.12] then yeah
[2715.84 - 2720.00] there could be a problem that could
[2717.12 - 2721.36] develop i'm a human being i'm not super
[2720.00 - 2723.84] natural
[2721.36 - 2726.24] human to superhuman or something you
[2723.84 - 2727.20] know not a superhero
[2726.24 - 2729.28] um
[2727.20 - 2733.36] anna says anna says why does stomach get
[2729.28 - 2735.52] upset when you take so many at one time
[2733.36 - 2736.56] well i don't ever get an upset stomach
[2735.52 - 2738.88] right
[2736.56 - 2740.40] so i can take a whole bunch at once if
[2738.88 - 2741.84] you're somebody you know you could be
[2740.40 - 2744.00] somebody already
[2741.84 - 2745.28] here's here's the thing too so be your
[2744.00 - 2747.92] own detective
[2745.28 - 2749.68] your stomach never gets upset ever
[2747.92 - 2751.52] so only when you take a bunch of
[2749.68 - 2753.76] supplements at once like it never gets
[2751.52 - 2755.60] upset like you don't have a history like
[2753.76 - 2758.16] ask yourself do i have a history of my
[2755.60 - 2761.76] stomach getting upset when i
[2758.16 - 2763.84] had popcorn and i ate this or i did this
[2761.76 - 2765.76] do i get have i ever been to a doctor
[2763.84 - 2767.60] about acid reflux have you ever been to
[2765.76 - 2770.16] a doctor about my stomach being upset
[2767.60 - 2772.56] like be your own detective and realize
[2770.16 - 2774.48] that it's not the supplements
[2772.56 - 2776.48] that make them upset
[2774.48 - 2778.24] unless it's something like you took a
[2776.48 - 2780.56] vitamin c that's straight ascorbic acid
[2778.24 - 2782.56] which is like battery acid right so you
[2780.56 - 2784.64] took a vitamin c i don't have the microc
[2782.56 - 2787.28] right here in front of me but you took a
[2784.64 - 2789.44] vitamin c that's like straight ascorbic
[2787.28 - 2790.96] acid and you have a sensitive stomach
[2789.44 - 2793.84] then yeah you're going to burn a hole in
[2790.96 - 2795.60] your stomach from bad vitamin c's
[2793.84 - 2797.28] there's vitamin c's in those packets you
[2795.60 - 2798.56] know those little packets everybody goes
[2797.28 - 2800.32] into the store they're like oh i'm going
[2798.56 - 2803.52] to grab some of those vitamin c packets
[2800.32 - 2805.92] right there that's straight battery acid
[2803.52 - 2807.76] straight but i saw i actually saw a what
[2805.92 - 2810.00] is a commercial on youtube for those
[2807.76 - 2812.08] just recently or something like that
[2810.00 - 2814.48] and i'm like oh great yeah
[2812.08 - 2816.40] put 10 million dollars into advertising
[2814.48 - 2817.60] advertising that battery acid in a
[2816.40 - 2819.36] packet
[2817.60 - 2821.12] right so you know
[2819.36 - 2823.04] and if you got a sensitive stomach it's
[2821.12 - 2825.36] things like that that can really
[2823.04 - 2827.28] aggravate that stomach
[2825.36 - 2828.72] but people that you know and you know
[2827.28 - 2830.40] people have inflamed nerves in the
[2828.72 - 2833.60] stomach so if they have inflamed nerves
[2830.40 - 2837.12] in the stomach if they have
[2833.60 - 2837.12] if someone has um
[2839.76 - 2846.16] someone has a sensitive nervous system
[2842.72 - 2848.64] nerves going to the stomach
[2846.16 - 2851.12] if someone has
[2848.64 - 2852.56] an ulcer and they don't know it right
[2851.12 - 2855.60] they might have an ulcer and they
[2852.56 - 2855.60] actually don't know it
[2856.16 - 2858.56] okay
[2857.68 - 2859.76] so
[2858.56 - 2861.52] that means you're gonna be sensitive
[2859.76 - 2863.28] with other things too so if you're
[2861.52 - 2864.96] someone that never went to a doctor or
[2863.28 - 2866.80] never complained about a stomach problem
[2864.96 - 2868.40] ever and you're taking a bunch of
[2866.80 - 2870.40] supplements and it's giving you a tummy
[2868.40 - 2871.92] ache make sure they're the right kind
[2870.40 - 2873.52] make sure they're high quality make sure
[2871.92 - 2874.88] there's no alcohol in those supplements
[2873.52 - 2876.72] make sure there's no
[2874.88 - 2878.80] all the fillers and crazy fillers and
[2876.72 - 2882.00] citric acid citric acid in a supplement
[2878.80 - 2884.40] will just burn the burn the heck out of
[2882.00 - 2886.08] the stomach lining
[2884.40 - 2887.68] i mean the vimergy stuff's not like that
[2886.08 - 2889.76] so i just want to make that clear so
[2887.68 - 2891.12] that's not like that and if for some
[2889.76 - 2892.88] reason you're somebody because you have
[2891.12 - 2894.16] stomach problems then you take it slow
[2892.88 - 2895.44] and you do a little bit at a time ask
[2894.16 - 2897.76] your doctor what's right for you that's
[2895.44 - 2900.48] what i would tell a family member
[2897.76 - 2903.04] when someone's sensitive they could
[2900.48 - 2904.72] think you know they can take less and
[2903.04 - 2906.24] then have it with foods it's another
[2904.72 - 2907.76] thing too like if someone's really
[2906.24 - 2909.20] sensitive because they have sensitive
[2907.76 - 2911.28] stomach issues and they want to take a
[2909.20 - 2914.24] little bit of b12 or something you take
[2911.28 - 2916.00] it with food and you take less
[2914.24 - 2917.60] right
[2916.00 - 2920.00] sherry joy green good to see you dr
[2917.60 - 2921.20] sherry
[2920.00 - 2922.96] so you guys this is some of the
[2921.20 - 2924.00] information i want to talk about today
[2922.96 - 2927.36] and
[2924.00 - 2929.76] when it comes down to supplementation
[2927.36 - 2932.00] there's so many bad versions out there
[2929.76 - 2933.92] that they can create a scar in
[2932.00 - 2935.92] somebody's life with supplements so then
[2933.92 - 2938.96] someone is someone's taking so many bad
[2935.92 - 2940.88] multivitamins and protein powders and
[2938.96 - 2943.12] and you know bad hair skin and nail
[2940.88 - 2945.52] supplements and bad herbal concoctions
[2943.12 - 2948.40] that were with alcohol or herbal powders
[2945.52 - 2950.96] that had all that clay in it and
[2948.40 - 2953.68] they have these bad experiences and that
[2950.96 - 2956.00] doesn't help right now you don't have to
[2953.68 - 2957.52] take supplements to heal depending on
[2956.00 - 2959.92] where you are like the medical medium
[2957.52 - 2961.44] information is customizable like i said
[2959.92 - 2962.72] you can start with celery juice i can't
[2961.44 - 2964.24] tell you how many people in this world
[2962.72 - 2965.84] are drinking celery juice right now and
[2964.24 - 2968.00] they've gotten rid of their acid reflux
[2965.84 - 2969.52] or whatever it is just from celery juice
[2968.00 - 2971.12] angela says anthony please tell the
[2969.52 - 2975.04] people if they can take them all
[2971.12 - 2976.40] together or if they can space them out
[2975.04 - 2978.80] do what's right
[2976.40 - 2981.28] by you and your doctor but what i do is
[2978.80 - 2984.32] i take them all together
[2981.28 - 2986.64] just out of out of easiness for me right
[2984.32 - 2988.56] so i'll take them all together okay you
[2986.64 - 2990.48] can space them out if you want you can
[2988.56 - 2992.16] take them all together you can do
[2990.48 - 2994.24] anything you'd like to do just getting
[2992.16 - 2996.24] them in is really important
[2994.24 - 2999.04] stephanie crown says can you combine
[2996.24 - 3001.20] drops of different things to take all at
[2999.04 - 3005.84] the same time please or should be
[3001.20 - 3007.36] separate help answer please i'm very ill
[3005.84 - 3009.04] you know i tell doctors all the time
[3007.36 - 3010.96] that their patients can put them all in
[3009.04 - 3012.96] the same thing because a lot of people
[3010.96 - 3014.64] are sick so what they'll do is they
[3012.96 - 3016.40] don't have the energy to do it
[3014.64 - 3018.24] differently so i just put some actual
[3016.40 - 3019.84] god in there now i just put some b12 in
[3018.24 - 3021.28] there you know do what your doctor tells
[3019.84 - 3023.28] you to do i'm just showing you what i
[3021.28 - 3025.52] would do personally or for my
[3023.28 - 3027.68] friends or family right and then you add
[3025.52 - 3029.60] water to this so there's some cat's claw
[3027.68 - 3032.08] in there so i did some cat's claw i did

[3049.12 - 3052.00] lemon balm in here yeah and you could do
[3050.64 - 3053.60] that and then you add a little bit of
[3052.00 - 3056.48] water to it so let me go and add a
[3053.60 - 3056.48] little bit of water
[3056.80 - 3059.68] okay

[3120.40 - 3124.00] hoping he's doing good i haven't heard
[3122.24 - 3125.76] from dr nesbit in a little while and
[3124.00 - 3127.52] that scares me because he could be on a
[3125.76 - 3129.60] drinking binge
[3127.52 - 3131.44] and uh i know he said he had a tough
[3129.60 - 3135.76] week of surgeries and sometimes he just
[3131.44 - 3138.40] disappears and i hope he's not
[3135.76 - 3140.64] slaying around with too much alcohol in
[3138.40 - 3143.60] a system so i will check on dr nesbit
[3140.64 - 3146.72] when i can i love you guys
