[53.88 - 59.70] into it a little bit so I'm making three
[57.72 - 61.32] different kinds of nut Butters I'm
[59.70 - 64.02] making talking three different kinds of
[61.32 - 65.34] guacamole I'm making a hummus and I'm
[64.02 - 68.46] making something else I don't know what
[65.34 - 71.76] it is I'm not sure celery juice and the
[68.46 - 75.90] nerve acid gut stabilizer okay making
[71.76 - 77.22] that two medical medium parsley shot so

[86.16 - 90.84] some thyme lemons and limes right here

[90.84 - 94.62] guacamole is this what we're gonna be
[92.28 - 100.70] doing let's get on to it so right here
[94.62 - 105.66] you guys this is the mm-1500 100 off 100
[100.70 - 107.34] off on the machine right now this is an
[105.66 - 109.74] incredible machine it is the medicine
[107.34 - 112.32] maker I call that the reason why is
[109.74 - 114.54] because it extracts to such a degree and
[112.32 - 116.10] what happens with other juicers like the
[114.54 - 117.48] basket juicers that everybody gets
[116.10 - 119.52] suckered into because they think it's
[117.48 - 122.52] easy or something to use what happens
[119.52 - 124.20] with like the basket juicers is it's
[122.52 - 126.48] deficient juice so you're drinking
[124.20 - 128.88] deficient juice so you think you're
[126.48 - 130.92] getting juice in you that's providing
[128.88 - 133.44] something for you but it creates a
[130.92 - 136.14] deficiency over time because it's not
[133.44 - 137.72] extracting enough of the nutrients the
[136.14 - 141.00] mm 1500
[137.72 - 144.60] extracts such a large quantity of
[141.00 - 147.12] critical nutrients literally leaves dust
[144.60 - 148.38] behind to that degree almost and you
[147.12 - 150.78] guys know I work with the mega and
[148.38 - 151.80] everything this is the mm 1500 so I
[150.78 - 154.08] can't wait to show you I'm going to make
[151.80 - 155.64] some celery that's one thing all on its
[154.08 - 156.42] own the one thing I want to run by you

[452.52 - 457.92] the mm 1500 I'm cruising because I got a
[456.12 - 460.02] lot of stuff to do I got three
[457.92 - 463.02] guacamoles to make I got a hummus to
[460.02 - 465.00] make I got three nut Butters to make and
[463.02 - 470.22] I'm gonna show you guys how you're being
[465.00 - 475.28] scammed so badly it hurts with the nut
[470.22 - 479.58] Butters buying nut Butters is so abusive
[475.28 - 482.82] The Nut Butter business is so abusive on
[479.58 - 484.98] the customer yes you don't know it but
[482.82 - 486.66] you're being abused when you go and buy
[484.98 - 489.36] that nut butter and I'm gonna talk about
[486.66 - 491.64] how it sounds like crazy but it's not
[489.36 - 493.14] wait till I describe how it works what
[491.64 - 495.00] goes on with nut Butters in the whole
[493.14 - 497.60] bit so I'm really looking forward to
[495.00 - 497.60] showing you guys
[498.30 - 502.62] you know the thing is the transparency
[500.22 - 504.68] is not out there every food we eat every
[502.62 - 507.18] pack of food every bottle of food
[504.68 - 508.86] transparency is not out there all kinds
[507.18 - 510.78] of different things it's just not there
[508.86 - 512.58] so it's important that people know
[510.78 - 514.26] what's going on
[512.58 - 516.96] now what you're seeing right here is
[514.26 - 520.32] high compression this mm-1500 you guys
[516.96 - 523.08] know if you have a 1500 or a 900 what
[520.32 - 525.42] you see right here is really dry pulp
[523.08 - 527.58] because of the compression someone might
[525.42 - 529.86] say oh well look it's not going all the
[527.58 - 532.08] way through oh yeah well there's a
[529.86 - 533.64] reason why it's held back a little bit
[532.08 - 535.44] because you're looking at high
[533.64 - 536.76] compression you're looking if you can
[535.44 - 538.08] see here with this camera right there
[536.76 - 540.96] you see how that camera's on there you
[538.08 - 544.08] guys right now how sick is that this
[540.96 - 549.60] isn't wet and sloppy pulp this isn't
[544.08 - 552.30] just wet drippy sloppy pulp this is dry
[549.60 - 554.52] way drier than anything out there those
[552.30 - 556.62] basket juicers it's a rip a total
[554.52 - 558.60] rip-off it doesn't get the nutrients out
[556.62 - 560.64] it doesn't squeeze the juice out you got
[558.60 - 562.20] to be extremely wealthy just to throw
[560.64 - 564.18] your stuff in there and let the basket
[562.20 - 566.58] thing spin around and you're gonna be
[564.18 - 569.22] wealthy because you have to buy so much
[566.58 - 570.90] more produce to make a juice now but if
[569.22 - 572.52] you're somebody with chronic illness and
[570.90 - 574.68] you need to heal and you need to recover
[572.52 - 576.36] and get your life back it's important
[574.68 - 578.28] that you have something that's not only
[576.36 - 582.78] extracting the nutrients that you need
[578.28 - 585.84] to heal but you need okay you need juice
[582.78 - 587.70] that's free and clear from any kind of
[585.84 - 589.86] other contaminants you don't know that
[587.70 - 592.68] are in the basket juicers it's a whole
[589.86 - 595.14] nother thing all on its own and then the
[592.68 - 596.88] cost for buying loads of produce and
[595.14 - 599.34] getting very little juice out of it
[596.88 - 601.38] putting way more into the basket and
[599.34 - 603.42] getting very little juice that's not the
[601.38 - 604.98] way to go so anyway already I got some
[603.42 - 606.96] juice right there
[604.98 - 609.54] so
[606.96 - 611.28] I'm going to shut this down
[609.54 - 612.78] I got a nice little screen here you want
[611.28 - 614.16] to strain your celery juice the reason
[612.78 - 615.84] why you don't want to pull you want
[614.16 - 618.24] don't want pulp in there you don't want
[615.84 - 620.70] too much grit in there the grit and the
[618.24 - 623.76] pulp slows down the digestive process
[620.70 - 625.68] you want this stuff going Lightning Fast
[623.76 - 628.20] into your bloodstream Lightning Fast
[625.68 - 630.06] into your body so it gets to your bones
[628.20 - 631.92] it gets to your brain the electrolytes
[630.06 - 633.66] get to the brain that's what you need do
[631.92 - 636.12] you want your neurons firing and you
[633.66 - 637.86] want them devouring all those minerals
[636.12 - 639.18] and Trace mineral salts and all the
[637.86 - 641.10] different nutrients that are in the
[639.18 - 643.32] celery juice you want your brain your
[641.10 - 646.20] brain stem and your neurons to suck it
[643.32 - 648.18] up and devour it and bring it in and
[646.20 - 651.74] tune up with it that's what you want
[648.18 - 651.74] it's critical so all right
[652.04 - 657.30] nice nice nice first of all I want to
[654.84 - 658.44] show you one thing okay I want to show
[657.30 - 660.24] you the pulp

[669.84 - 676.62] not wet and sloppy it's not and this is
[672.96 - 678.90] very fibrous celery right here really

[678.90 - 684.42] spend money on celery okay and it might
[681.78 - 686.94] not be the juiciest batch this is not a
[684.42 - 688.80] juicy batch of celery I remember when I
[686.94 - 691.74] bought this right here and I looked at
[688.80 - 694.50] it I was like your spindly you're skinny
[691.74 - 696.96] and spindly and small the stalks there's
[694.50 - 698.46] not a lot of juice in here probably been
[696.96 - 699.96] you know sitting in a warehouse for a
[698.46 - 703.44] little while before it got into the
[699.96 - 705.48] store and even with all that I squeeze
[703.44 - 707.70] the hell out of what I put through there

[781.38 - 784.98] so pumped about that as I almost spill
[783.42 - 789.02] the whole thing but we're live and
[784.98 - 793.38] that's how it rolls all right and
[789.02 - 797.22] we got the pulp which is dry 1500 mm
[793.38 - 799.26] 1500 hundred dollars off on this machine
[797.22 - 801.24] right now it's the mm 1500 Link in the
[799.26 - 802.44] profile Link in the description wait do
[801.24 - 803.64] you see what it does I'm gonna make some
[802.44 - 805.14] nut Butters because I know you guys are
[803.64 - 807.60] eating nut Butters I see it out there
[805.14 - 810.36] all the time people are having peanuts
[807.60 - 811.80] and almonds and almond butter and Tahini
[810.36 - 814.82] and all of that and you guys know I work
[811.80 - 818.40] with the mega because these machines are
[814.82 - 819.96] amazing this machine is I don't know but
[818.40 - 822.54] the other ones I'm saying this is the
[819.96 - 825.36] 1500 that has the high compression that
[822.54 - 827.94] squeezes the nutrients out that's what
[825.36 - 830.04] I'm talking about right there pumped all
[827.94 - 833.16] right I'm gonna make a parsley shot
[830.04 - 835.62] nerve gut acid stabilizer Right medical
[833.16 - 837.60] medium brain shot therapy I'm gonna move
[835.62 - 838.98] this juice over right here you guys
[837.60 - 842.04] don't mind
[838.98 - 844.80] okay so I'm in the brain saver protocols
[842.04 - 848.22] I'm gonna find it I have it marked
[844.80 - 850.86] because this is a big ass book look at
[848.22 - 851.70] this nerve gut acid stabilizer right
[850.86 - 853.56] there
[851.70 - 854.70] I just want to read that really quick
[853.56 - 856.68] even though we're gonna be making
[854.70 - 859.20] guacamois and everything else
[856.68 - 861.06] use the stabilizing shot if you're
[859.20 - 862.56] looking to strengthen your vagus nerves
[861.06 - 864.36] who's looking to strengthen their vagus
[862.56 - 868.70] nerves
[864.36 - 868.70] Tremors shakes spasms
[868.80 - 873.72] tingles numbness tightness of the chest
[871.20 - 876.54] panic attacks anxiety
[873.72 - 880.20] that's just to name a few who's looking
[876.54 - 883.44] to strengthen their vagus nerves there
[880.20 - 885.72] we go nerve gut acid stabilizer
[883.44 - 888.66] if you're dealing with gastric spasms
[885.72 - 891.56] flatulence chronic gastritis mild acid
[888.66 - 895.62] reflux or other digestive disturbances
[891.56 - 897.54] for including acute acid reflux right
[895.62 - 899.58] you're looking at the nerve gut acid
[897.54 - 901.50] stabilizer you feel your food is not
[899.58 - 903.06] digesting and you want to change that
[901.50 - 905.40] over time and build it up if you feel
[903.06 - 908.04] like your food's not breaking down
[905.40 - 909.96] nerve gut acid stabilizer
[908.04 - 912.66] if you feel you have poor nutrient
[909.96 - 915.00] absorption if you've been told you have
[912.66 - 916.98] a microbiome or gut microflora condition
[915.00 - 917.88] or problem which everybody gets told
[916.98 - 919.92] that
[917.88 - 921.24] they really don't know how to get people
[919.92 - 922.50] better they don't know why they're
[921.24 - 924.54] really sick but everybody's in the
[922.50 - 927.18] microbiome microbiome take this take
[924.54 - 930.30] that and this this this this 10 doctors
[927.18 - 932.58] later 30 vials of blood here 10 vials of
[930.30 - 934.44] blood here it's just so sad what's going
[932.58 - 937.02] on out there you've been told you have a
[934.44 - 938.82] microbiome biome problem right you still
[937.02 - 941.16] don't know what's wrong with you you
[938.82 - 943.50] feel as if you're toxic or your blood is
[941.16 - 945.18] toxic that's what I love about this
[943.50 - 948.78] nerve gut acid stabilizer we're going to
[945.18 - 952.14] make it helps with the blood toxicity
[948.78 - 953.94] which is a big deal talking really fast
[952.14 - 956.88] here because I know I have so much to do
[953.94 - 958.44] you feel that your liver and lymph are
[956.88 - 960.72] toxic
[958.44 - 963.18] stagnant and sluggish
[960.72 - 964.92] you're feeling an acidy stomach acidity
[963.18 - 966.66] Sensations in your throat or mouth or
[964.92 - 969.96] acidity feelings throughout your body
[966.66 - 971.52] your body odor is more noticeable than
[969.96 - 973.92] usual
[971.52 - 975.72] you're dealing with chronic nausea or
[973.92 - 977.58] chronic bloating how many people are
[975.72 - 979.26] dealing with chronic nausea or chronic
[977.58 - 981.60] bloating out there I know a lot of
[979.26 - 983.70] people are dealing with that it's awful
[981.60 - 985.68] sometimes their bloating is so bad
[983.70 - 987.90] they're out to here and they're just
[985.68 - 990.24] bloated it's just oh God it's tough
[987.90 - 993.78] you're trying to repair an acidic body
[990.24 - 996.18] system and you make your body more
[993.78 - 997.38] alkaline through the gut stabilizer so I
[996.18 - 999.42] just wanted to read a little bit about
[997.38 - 1001.70] this next thing I'm making the nerve gut
[999.42 - 1004.34] acid stabilizer okay from the medical
[1001.70 - 1005.48] medium brain shot therapy in protocols
[1004.34 - 1007.16] right there
[1005.48 - 1010.52] let's get into it
[1007.16 - 1014.38] so I'm going to run some parsley in here
[1010.52 - 1014.38] and I'm gonna get this ready right now
[1019.94 - 1024.34] together
[1021.86 - 1024.34] okay
[1024.74 - 1029.00] there's a dedicated support line at
[1027.56 - 1030.86] Omega so when you go there it's a
[1029.00 - 1033.74] medical medium support line just so you
[1030.86 - 1035.24] know for the mm 1500 900 you'll find the
[1033.74 - 1036.68] information on this machine in the
[1035.24 - 1038.08] description link is in description link
[1036.68 - 1040.94] is in the profile
[1038.08 - 1043.04] cmm1500 people
[1040.94 - 1046.22] don't juice
[1043.04 - 1049.94] like the medical medium Community juices
[1046.22 - 1052.28] people don't put wear and tear on their
[1049.94 - 1054.14] Machinery on their juicers like the
[1052.28 - 1057.86] medical medium Community does
[1054.14 - 1061.16] there is no community in the world that
[1057.86 - 1062.72] runs stuff through juicers day in and
[1061.16 - 1064.52] day out like the medical medium
[1062.72 - 1066.02] Community there are people in this
[1064.52 - 1068.90] community that are running brain shots
[1066.02 - 1070.82] right here every single day two three
[1068.90 - 1072.46] brain shots a day they're running two
[1070.82 - 1076.52] celery juices a day
[1072.46 - 1078.80] every single day they're doing this the
[1076.52 - 1082.16] other juicers out there will never stand
[1078.80 - 1085.16] up for that ever the basket juicers will
[1082.16 - 1087.32] never stand up everything gets dull and
[1085.16 - 1090.62] it falls apart it can't handle that
[1087.32 - 1093.44] intensity it's not possible that's why
[1090.62 - 1095.06] the mm-1500 is here it's here to handle
[1093.44 - 1097.52] that and people don't realize that they
[1095.06 - 1099.44] don't know how much juicing how much
[1097.52 - 1101.84] dedication towards bringing back health
[1099.44 - 1103.94] because the medical meaning Community is
[1101.84 - 1107.30] a community of people that that were
[1103.94 - 1109.10] really really sick bedridden big
[1107.30 - 1111.74] difference between being not so sick
[1109.10 - 1113.96] versus really sick with chronic illness
[1111.74 - 1115.58] and chronic mystery illness not just a
[1113.96 - 1117.50] little stuff here and a little stuff
[1115.58 - 1118.88] there which is fine too because that's
[1117.50 - 1121.82] that's hard on people and I understand
[1118.88 - 1124.52] I'm not demeaning or undermining or
[1121.82 - 1126.08] belittling that on any level but the
[1124.52 - 1128.36] majority of the people in the medical
[1126.08 - 1131.66] Maine Community Came From Hell
[1128.36 - 1135.62] and back they were deep in the woods
[1131.66 - 1138.20] deep in the dark woods with no sunshine
[1135.62 - 1139.58] and they fought their way out and they
[1138.20 - 1141.32] crawled and they fought and they
[1139.58 - 1144.08] scratched their way out and they got to
[1141.32 - 1146.72] the woods line and they entered into the
[1144.08 - 1149.54] sunlight in the field because they found
[1146.72 - 1151.46] answers and tools like such that we're
[1149.54 - 1153.38] talking about right here like the right
[1151.46 - 1155.60] juicers and the rights of doing celery
[1153.38 - 1157.16] juice every single day and doing the
[1155.60 - 1158.66] brain shots and so forth and so much
[1157.16 - 1161.42] it's all right
[1158.66 - 1163.70] I'm just gonna knock out that pulp right
[1161.42 - 1168.28] there so I want to run some celery get
[1163.70 - 1168.28] the nerve got acid stabilizer going
[1169.04 - 1171.64] all right
[1171.92 - 1177.94] probably gonna be a little bit of
[1174.20 - 1177.94] celery still going in here too
[1178.28 - 1184.76] parsley is really really tough
[1181.64 - 1188.06] you need a powerful juicer that doesn't
[1184.76 - 1191.30] destroy the nutrients but still juices
[1188.06 - 1193.40] The Parsley okay sometimes you might get
[1191.30 - 1195.44] a log Jam in here
[1193.40 - 1198.68] when you're dealing with this much
[1195.44 - 1201.56] fibrous material like the stems but the
[1198.68 - 1204.14] stems of the parsley hold
[1201.56 - 1207.22] these incredible minerals that help
[1204.14 - 1207.22] bring people back
[1209.00 - 1213.56] someone's someone asks me family friend
[1211.40 - 1216.86] or somebody gets a hold of me and
[1213.56 - 1219.38] they're like a w what do I do about this
[1216.86 - 1222.20] or that and I'm like are you doing the
[1219.38 - 1226.12] parsley shot are you doing the nerve gut
[1222.20 - 1226.12] acid acid stabilizer
[1227.24 - 1232.70] so right now
[1230.06 - 1234.14] what I like to do is I like to do a
[1232.70 - 1236.18] couple of different different shot
[1234.14 - 1239.74] meaning like I like to do this once
[1236.18 - 1239.74] twice three times a day
[1240.29 - 1245.60] [Applause]
[1242.84 - 1248.24] I'm running parsley through here
[1245.60 - 1254.26] parsley is not easy to juice and this is
[1248.24 - 1254.26] totally crushing it it is crushing it
[1254.48 - 1260.36] and here's what's amazing the parsley's
[1257.24 - 1263.18] coming out dry which means you're
[1260.36 - 1264.56] squeezing out all the nutrients
[1263.18 - 1266.00] what you'll hear out there is people
[1264.56 - 1267.56] saying oh you want to just blend
[1266.00 - 1270.02] everything you never want to juice
[1267.56 - 1272.96] because you you um you lose all the
[1270.02 - 1276.02] fiber and all that stuff but not when
[1272.96 - 1279.08] you're sick and you need an infusion
[1276.02 - 1281.00] you need a main line when you're sick
[1279.08 - 1282.50] you need a main line of direct nutrients
[1281.00 - 1284.48] and when you're using something like the
[1282.50 - 1287.18] mm-1500 you're getting that many
[1284.48 - 1290.62] nutrients out of it
[1287.18 - 1294.76] you're getting a main line
[1290.62 - 1294.76] directly into your system
[1298.28 - 1301.94] all right so
[1300.26 - 1303.98] foreign
[1301.94 - 1305.84] probably one of my favorite things to do
[1303.98 - 1308.00] is make the parsley shot which is the
[1305.84 - 1311.38] nerve gut acid stabilizer I like the
[1308.00 - 1311.38] nickname you know the parsley shot
[1311.42 - 1315.80] just putting a little bit more in there
[1313.64 - 1320.92] parsley gets thick
[1315.80 - 1320.92] really thick in the container
[1323.00 - 1327.26] now I'm not straining this one I want
[1325.40 - 1330.82] this one real thick you can strain it
[1327.26 - 1330.82] you can use the strainer which is fine
[1332.18 - 1335.38] I'm gonna put a little bit more
[1337.22 - 1340.64] you guys if you just got on here I'm
[1339.32 - 1343.10] going to be making three different kinds
[1340.64 - 1345.20] of guacamole on medicine guacamole I'm
[1343.10 - 1347.36] gonna make a spicy hot guacamole I'm
[1345.20 - 1348.98] gonna make regular standard
[1347.36 - 1352.48] guacamole
[1348.98 - 1352.48] a basic guacamole
[1355.88 - 1361.06] all right
[1357.86 - 1361.06] I got that to go through
[1361.40 - 1366.80] why am I so excited today
[1364.46 - 1368.42] all right
[1366.80 - 1370.94] okay
[1368.42 - 1374.18] one of the reasons why I'm so excited
[1370.94 - 1378.56] this is practically dust
[1374.18 - 1383.36] this is ripped to shreds
[1378.56 - 1386.54] This is Dusty dry you can see the like
[1383.36 - 1388.34] it literally as if it was a dried herb
[1386.54 - 1390.44] did you ever play with dried herbs and
[1388.34 - 1392.48] you see all like the dust and the powder
[1390.44 - 1394.40] that's just coming off of the dried herb
[1392.48 - 1396.86] have you ever seen that do you guys see
[1394.40 - 1399.38] what I'm talking about good luck with
[1396.86 - 1401.54] any other juicer ever seeing that you
[1399.38 - 1404.98] will never see that in any other juicer
[1401.54 - 1410.36] it's literally air drying as we speak
[1404.98 - 1413.42] The Parsley fibers this has been ripped
[1410.36 - 1417.50] to shreds but masticated crushed
[1413.42 - 1420.44] carefully not overheated
[1417.50 - 1421.64] this is unbelievable the nutrients that
[1420.44 - 1423.50] just came out of there these are the
[1421.64 - 1425.30] things that make or break
[1423.50 - 1427.16] these are the things that make or break
[1425.30 - 1429.86] you know I hear people out there say hey
[1427.16 - 1431.36] I did mm I did it didn't get me better
[1429.86 - 1433.64] and when you look and you see they did
[1431.36 - 1436.58] all this cacao they ate every other day
[1433.64 - 1438.44] they were doing too many fats they were
[1436.58 - 1440.72] having too many cheat days which I
[1438.44 - 1442.58] understand I'm not judging anybody they
[1440.72 - 1445.04] weren't on any real protocols from the
[1442.58 - 1446.72] medical medium information and then they
[1445.04 - 1448.28] weren't juicing that much and they were
[1446.72 - 1449.78] using maybe the wrong thing like a
[1448.28 - 1451.46] spinning basket juicer and they got
[1449.78 - 1453.38] ripped off and they didn't know it's not
[1451.46 - 1454.22] anybody's fault it just happens out
[1453.38 - 1456.26] there
[1454.22 - 1458.42] and they don't realize would you do
[1456.26 - 1460.58] something where you make the nerve gut
[1458.42 - 1463.10] acid stabilizer where literally The
[1460.58 - 1465.20] Parsley turns to practically dust dry
[1463.10 - 1466.64] when you see you see that
[1465.20 - 1467.42] do you realize what you're getting in
[1466.64 - 1470.48] you
[1467.42 - 1474.62] it's profound it's a whole nother game
[1470.48 - 1476.84] whole nother situation for healing whoa
[1474.62 - 1478.46] Okay so
[1476.84 - 1481.42] I'm gonna get a little spoon in here
[1478.46 - 1481.42] just mix it up
[1484.58 - 1489.32] okay let's pour it in a shot glass
[1487.64 - 1490.76] if you guys just got here we're making a
[1489.32 - 1492.38] lot of things but this is an important
[1490.76 - 1494.14] one right here let's go maybe we can get
[1492.38 - 1496.52] a close-up on that one too
[1494.14 - 1499.46] never know there it is you guys you got
[1496.52 - 1500.72] the close-up right there boom check it
[1499.46 - 1502.64] out
[1500.72 - 1507.16] that is
[1502.64 - 1507.16] the medicine right there
[1512.30 - 1518.66] it packs a punch it has a bite
[1516.14 - 1520.88] it's all medicine
[1518.66 - 1526.48] it's smooth
[1520.88 - 1526.48] silky but strong but powerful
[1526.78 - 1530.14] send it down
[1531.08 - 1536.36] sounds good nice
[1534.38 - 1537.62] feels good
[1536.36 - 1539.48] all right
[1537.62 - 1540.80] okay
[1539.48 - 1543.70] you guys have to understand something
[1540.80 - 1543.70] very important
[1544.04 - 1550.04] the fiber in a plant
[1547.76 - 1552.20] we just poop out
[1550.04 - 1554.06] that's what we do
[1552.20 - 1556.40] now fiber is important inside our diet
[1554.06 - 1558.14] but we get plenty of fiber plenty of it
[1556.40 - 1559.70] you can eat an apple and get plenty of
[1558.14 - 1561.44] fiber
[1559.70 - 1563.36] you can eat some leafy greens to get
[1561.44 - 1566.30] plenty of fiber but we're talking about
[1563.36 - 1568.28] creating medicine the fiber we don't
[1566.30 - 1570.92] need when we're trying to actually heal
[1568.28 - 1573.86] ourselves of ailments
[1570.92 - 1576.02] gut spasms gut problems Crohn's colitis
[1573.86 - 1577.58] IBS
[1576.02 - 1580.58] celiac
[1577.58 - 1582.86] chronic fatigue syndrome fibro right
[1580.58 - 1584.42] rheumatoid ra
[1582.86 - 1585.86] all the different conditions that
[1584.42 - 1587.78] everybody is dealing with every single
[1585.86 - 1590.42] day
[1587.78 - 1592.34] dizziness blurry eyes mysterious
[1590.42 - 1595.04] problems ringing in the ears
[1592.34 - 1597.56] vertigo tinnitus
[1595.04 - 1598.94] whatever it is we need medicine it's so
[1597.56 - 1600.80] important
[1598.94 - 1604.04] but people will say well what about the
[1600.80 - 1608.60] fiberate there the plant stem the fiber
[1604.04 - 1612.64] is there to get the plant in the air
[1608.60 - 1612.64] so that the sun can hit it
[1612.92 - 1619.82] so the fiber is to erect the plant
[1617.12 - 1621.14] so it's straight up and it finds its way
[1619.82 - 1623.72] to the Sun
[1621.14 - 1626.78] and in this case you don't need
[1623.72 - 1629.60] all of the fiber you need the medicine
[1626.78 - 1631.70] that's within the herb
[1629.60 - 1633.16] in this situation right here this
[1631.70 - 1636.20] machine
[1633.16 - 1639.74] completely annihilated
[1636.20 - 1642.38] that parsley in a good way in a profound
[1639.74 - 1644.24] way it took out nutrients a nutrient
[1642.38 - 1646.46] spectrum that you would never get eating
[1644.24 - 1649.22] parsley and you would never get juicing
[1646.46 - 1653.72] with other juicers it created a nutrient
[1649.22 - 1656.06] profile for you to move the needle
[1653.72 - 1657.92] all right
[1656.06 - 1659.84] let's get going let's make some nut milk
[1657.92 - 1661.94] that's the next thing I'm gonna make
[1659.84 - 1664.58] some almond nut milk if you guys are
[1661.94 - 1666.20] okay with that
[1664.58 - 1668.26] just gonna move some stuff out of the
[1666.20 - 1671.62] way
[1668.26 - 1671.62] there we go
[1674.50 - 1680.00] all right
[1676.34 - 1683.44] mm 1500 is going to be at work making a
[1680.00 - 1683.44] nut milk right here
[1685.60 - 1690.40] what I'm doing is I'm going to put a
[1687.68 - 1690.40] screen on here
[1690.92 - 1696.92] that
[1691.88 - 1700.18] okay and I have some soaked almonds
[1696.92 - 1700.18] right here
[1703.40 - 1705.64] okay
[1705.80 - 1712.04] time to make some nut milk
[1709.04 - 1712.04] excited
[1717.74 - 1721.54] all right
[1719.00 - 1721.54] let's go
[1721.82 - 1725.56] I soak these almonds
[1727.22 - 1731.90] you might be somebody that's not into
[1728.72 - 1736.22] making your own nut milk if that's
[1731.90 - 1738.86] if that's what your jam is not doing
[1736.22 - 1741.38] totally fine
[1738.86 - 1743.18] but you can make your own nutmo
[1741.38 - 1746.48] if you guys hang out I'm gonna make
[1743.18 - 1749.24] three different nut Butters
[1746.48 - 1752.24] a hummus and three different guacamoles
[1749.24 - 1754.52] with the mm-1500
[1752.24 - 1758.66] this is the biggest sale on this machine
[1754.52 - 1761.06] ever so far it's a hundred dollars off
[1758.66 - 1764.24] the price is unbelievable for what it
[1761.06 - 1767.72] can do for you and what what
[1764.24 - 1771.82] it has to offer
[1767.72 - 1771.82] the price can't be beat
[1775.34 - 1780.38] so I'm making some pure nut milk
[1778.22 - 1782.00] wait a minute here you know what I
[1780.38 - 1783.68] forgot
[1782.00 - 1786.98] ah
[1783.68 - 1789.74] I forgot the natural flavors and the MSG
[1786.98 - 1793.88] and the carrageenan I forgot to put that
[1789.74 - 1797.18] in here ah bummer I forgot to put all
[1793.88 - 1798.86] the poison into the almond milk you know
[1797.18 - 1800.24] the kind that's in the bottles of almond
[1798.86 - 1802.16] milk out there the kind that's in the
[1800.24 - 1804.32] cartons all the poison in there the
[1802.16 - 1806.18] undisclosed hidden ingredients you don't
[1804.32 - 1809.54] even know about plus the natural flavors
[1806.18 - 1812.48] which is MSG and toxic stuff plus the
[1809.54 - 1814.82] carrageenan plus other garbage crap I
[1812.48 - 1818.18] forgot to add that in here
[1814.82 - 1820.52] darn it this is too pure what was I
[1818.18 - 1822.98] thinking
[1820.52 - 1826.42] what was I thinking
[1822.98 - 1826.42] someone tell me please
[1828.74 - 1832.88] I forgot to put the poisonous crap in
[1831.68 - 1835.70] here
[1832.88 - 1838.48] and everybody's drinking and eating
[1835.70 - 1838.48] every day
[1840.92 - 1845.72] so what I love about this machine is
[1843.08 - 1848.78] because it has an ability to pulverize
[1845.72 - 1851.30] to such a degree it's going to extract
[1848.78 - 1853.76] nutrients out of those almonds that you
[1851.30 - 1856.04] wouldn't get from the traditional
[1853.76 - 1858.02] store-bought almond milk you get out
[1856.04 - 1860.18] there every day you go and you go in
[1858.02 - 1862.16] there I'm gonna get some almond milk let
[1860.18 - 1865.54] me go get get another bottle of
[1862.16 - 1865.54] poisonous toxic almond milk

[1875.18 - 1878.38] chocolate bar on the way out
[1884.66 - 1889.36] all right the rest of that in there

[1904.36 - 1911.44] different containers and so forth but I
[1907.04 - 1911.44] might go in here instead so

[1980.72 - 1983.80] I'm gonna tell you right now
[1984.88 - 1991.28] if you get this machine and you make
[1988.58 - 1994.16] this almond milk and then you take a
[1991.28 - 1996.38] store-bought almond milk and you do a
[1994.16 - 1998.60] taste test difference you do this one
[1996.38 - 2000.82] and then you do that one
[1998.60 - 2004.30] and your mind is going to be blown
[2000.82 - 2008.02] I'll tell you why you taste pureness you
[2004.30 - 2009.88] taste cleanness you don't taste the
[2008.02 - 2011.80] poisonous crap they're slipping in there
[2009.88 - 2012.88] and the poisonous flavorings that you
[2011.80 - 2015.48] don't even see because they don't even
[2012.88 - 2015.48] disclose it
[2016.48 - 2019.08] like you don't
[2019.48 - 2023.32] you don't taste that

[2060.40 - 2066.88] I don't want to but I have to deliver
[2064.20 - 2069.54] important critical news
[2066.88 - 2069.54] to you
[2073.82 - 2077.00] [Music]
[2077.92 - 2081.88] take a good look
[2079.66 - 2083.38] take your time
[2081.88 - 2085.12] take a peek
[2083.38 - 2088.30] I'm even gonna do a close-up down here
[2085.12 - 2090.54] I'm going to put this one down here
[2088.30 - 2090.54] okay
[2090.82 - 2094.32] this was never opened
[2094.36 - 2098.22] the plastic is still on the top
[2098.26 - 2102.52] the plastic
[2100.06 - 2103.54] is still on the top I need you to know
[2102.52 - 2108.64] this
[2103.54 - 2111.70] you guys this is worth every single iota
[2108.64 - 2115.60] of your brain cells
[2111.70 - 2116.98] this is worth every single moment of my
[2115.60 - 2119.02] brain cells
[2116.98 - 2120.64] our brain cells are working together in
[2119.02 - 2123.70] unison right now
[2120.64 - 2125.62] your brain cells and my brain cells are
[2123.70 - 2127.12] Computing what you're seeing I'm
[2125.62 - 2131.76] computing
[2127.12 - 2131.76] my brain cells let's get into it
[2134.62 - 2137.44] see that peanut butter
[2136.18 - 2141.12] that oil
[2137.44 - 2141.12] is not from those peanuts
[2141.16 - 2145.06] see that almond butter
[2143.44 - 2148.62] that oil
[2145.06 - 2148.62] is not from those almonds
[2151.12 - 2157.02] you can't see this as it isn't clear but
[2153.40 - 2157.02] it's an unopened Tahiti
[2157.66 - 2163.68] and the oil on top of that unopened
[2159.76 - 2163.68] tahini is not from those seeds
[2166.12 - 2171.70] it's not
[2168.58 - 2174.28] from those seeds
[2171.70 - 2175.68] I hate to give you the hard
[2174.28 - 2179.08] true
[2175.68 - 2181.66] but it's not
[2179.08 - 2183.40] this is one of the best lessons you guys
[2181.66 - 2185.80] can have
[2183.40 - 2187.72] because the oils that are placed in all
[2185.80 - 2191.32] the nut Butters
[2187.72 - 2193.24] to save the nut butter company's money
[2191.32 - 2196.78] declines your health
[2193.24 - 2198.40] it declines your health and wellness and
[2196.78 - 2203.04] well-being
[2198.40 - 2203.04] this is a tahini right here
[2207.88 - 2212.10] better yet let me get a shot glass out
[2212.50 - 2218.40] you think the oil in all your tahinis
[2215.20 - 2218.40] all your tahinis
[2224.56 - 2227.34] take a look
[2227.56 - 2232.18] that is straight oil and that's not from
[2229.84 - 2235.24] your sesame seeds
[2232.18 - 2236.62] this is part of why people can't heal
[2235.24 - 2238.24] they think they're doing something good
[2236.62 - 2240.40] for themselves
[2238.24 - 2242.56] but they don't heal this is why vegans
[2240.40 - 2244.30] don't heal and they go back to eating
[2242.56 - 2247.06] eggs
[2244.30 - 2248.38] this is why vegetarians and people who
[2247.06 - 2251.14] are really mindful about their health
[2248.38 - 2252.70] this is part of why they don't heal it's
[2251.14 - 2253.60] simple things like this that they don't
[2252.70 - 2255.88] know
[2253.60 - 2258.84] and the medical medium has to
[2255.88 - 2258.84] show the truth
[2259.24 - 2265.42] that is pure straight oil but not from
[2263.02 - 2267.34] those sesame seeds in all the tahini
[2265.42 - 2269.38] bottles and jars that you guys have is
[2267.34 - 2272.56] added oil that comes from someplace else
[2269.38 - 2274.48] it's bulk cheap low-grade rancid oil
[2272.56 - 2275.92] it's in all your nut Butters and your
[2274.48 - 2277.96] tannies
[2275.92 - 2280.12] and that's why it is absolutely critical
[2277.96 - 2282.64] you learn how to make a nut butter
[2280.12 - 2284.32] if if you don't want the machine if you
[2282.64 - 2288.16] don't want the mm-1500 even though it's
[2284.32 - 2290.14] 100 off fine then don't eat nut Butters
[2288.16 - 2292.36] choose not to eat a nut butter because
[2290.14 - 2293.32] it's better and safer for you not to eat
[2292.36 - 2296.80] enough butter
[2293.32 - 2298.42] because of what that is right there
[2296.80 - 2300.82] you know
[2298.42 - 2302.32] let me get another shot glass or
[2300.82 - 2304.24] something like that I think I got
[2302.32 - 2307.08] another one somewhere I'll just rinse
[2304.24 - 2307.08] this one out real quick
[2307.48 - 2310.08] all right
[2310.54 - 2314.56] the oil you're looking at is not from
[2312.34 - 2316.72] those nuts or those seeds
[2314.56 - 2318.28] it is added to save the nut butter
[2316.72 - 2320.32] company's money
[2318.28 - 2322.48] it cheapens it
[2320.32 - 2324.70] they're putting old rancid oil that
[2322.48 - 2326.08] comes from bulk nuts from around the
[2324.70 - 2328.06] planet
[2326.08 - 2330.04] it's like people who are eating animal
[2328.06 - 2333.10] beef right now right they're animal
[2330.04 - 2333.76] protein eaters medical medium
[2333.10 - 2335.68] um
[2333.76 - 2338.32] uh is Pro
[2335.68 - 2341.50] vegan plant-based animal protein
[2338.32 - 2342.94] vegetarian whatever and you just gotta
[2341.50 - 2344.08] come here get the information learn how
[2342.94 - 2345.82] to heal if you want to be an animal
[2344.08 - 2348.22] protein person fine if you want to be a
[2345.82 - 2350.74] vegan fine but this is important to know
[2348.22 - 2352.90] for vegans plant-based people and for
[2350.74 - 2354.88] animal protein people
[2352.90 - 2356.68] what are people doing now who are eating
[2354.88 - 2358.48] animal protein they're really concerned
[2356.68 - 2359.80] and worried about where their beef comes
[2358.48 - 2362.80] from where their meat comes from right
[2359.80 - 2366.16] they'll say they want the local butcher
[2362.80 - 2368.68] that cuts a piece from that one cow they
[2366.16 - 2371.26] don't want chopped meat from a thousand
[2368.68 - 2372.82] cows Blended together so when they have
[2371.26 - 2375.34] a hamburger
[2372.82 - 2379.42] they don't want a hamburger that has the
[2375.34 - 2380.92] DNA from a thousand animals
[2379.42 - 2382.54] I mean that's original medical meme
[2380.92 - 2384.12] information though that I brought to
[2382.54 - 2386.68] that world
[2384.12 - 2389.14] though regardless
[2386.68 - 2390.70] you 30 years ago that was a mind blower
[2389.14 - 2393.16] for people when I said that a hamburger
[2390.70 - 2395.14] will have a thousand cows in it
[2393.16 - 2396.40] it was like literally 35 years ago it's
[2395.14 - 2397.72] one of the one of the things I was
[2396.40 - 2400.12] telling people they're like that doesn't
[2397.72 - 2402.52] make sense but it does
[2400.12 - 2404.56] but here's the thing you don't want your
[2402.52 - 2407.80] nut Butters
[2404.56 - 2409.90] to have almonds
[2407.80 - 2412.00] right
[2409.90 - 2413.62] from one Orchard
[2412.00 - 2415.48] but oil
[2413.62 - 2417.04] from a hundred different Orchards or
[2415.48 - 2418.72] some Orchard on the planet somewhere
[2417.04 - 2421.36] else
[2418.72 - 2423.52] you don't want it so separate and you
[2421.36 - 2426.88] don't want it added into your nut butter
[2423.52 - 2429.46] you don't want oil added into there
[2426.88 - 2431.74] it depreciates your health
[2429.46 - 2433.42] it's not good for your heart
[2431.74 - 2434.68] it's not good if you have chronic
[2433.42 - 2437.08] illness
[2434.68 - 2439.72] people are eating all the peanut butters
[2437.08 - 2442.42] all the almond butters all the tahinis
[2439.72 - 2444.10] all the cashew Butters all the hazelnut
[2442.42 - 2446.44] Butters and don't realize it they're
[2444.10 - 2448.06] drinking oil that's declining and taking
[2446.44 - 2449.92] down their health and they don't even
[2448.06 - 2451.36] know it this is the death by a Thousand
[2449.92 - 2454.90] Cuts
[2451.36 - 2458.70] this is the mm Death By A Thousand Cuts
[2454.90 - 2458.70] so I got another shot glass out here
[2460.84 - 2468.34] and I just poured
[2463.38 - 2470.20] two shot glasses this was never opened I
[2468.34 - 2471.52] can do it to four different tahini
[2470.20 - 2473.80] companies five different tahini
[2471.52 - 2477.46] companies this was never opened I just
[2473.80 - 2482.94] opened it for you and I just poured
[2477.46 - 2482.94] two of these sesame oil shot glasses
[2483.22 - 2489.04] I just poured four straight ounces of
[2486.64 - 2490.48] oil that wasn't from those sesame seeds
[2489.04 - 2491.92] and you guys will be drinking it when
[2490.48 - 2496.14] you take your tahinis out you'll be
[2491.92 - 2496.14] drinking that and you don't even know it
[2496.90 - 2499.66] and I'm gonna be careful with these
[2498.34 - 2501.70] because these are going to Spill and
[2499.66 - 2504.34] what a mess they're gonna make so I'm
[2501.70 - 2507.04] gonna put them maybe over here
[2504.34 - 2508.66] let's hope uh
[2507.04 - 2511.78] that's an almond butter that's never
[2508.66 - 2515.44] been opened look on top
[2511.78 - 2519.70] that's not the the oil from those nuts
[2515.44 - 2522.40] that's a peanut butter never opened look
[2519.70 - 2525.16] on top I'm gonna open it right now and
[2522.40 - 2526.72] I'm gonna show you something
[2525.16 - 2531.10] there's
[2526.72 - 2535.60] the lid never been opened right there
[2531.10 - 2539.40] there's the safety lid
[2535.60 - 2539.40] I'm gonna move these over for the moment
[2540.10 - 2543.06] let's get started
[2544.78 - 2547.96] there's so many different things that
[2546.28 - 2549.88] stop us from healing when we're really
[2547.96 - 2551.98] sick we have to go all the way sometimes
[2549.88 - 2553.42] we have to incorporate more tools and
[2551.98 - 2555.04] more tools and then we got to be careful
[2553.42 - 2557.20] and we have to weed out the crap in the
[2555.04 - 2558.88] garbage because there's people out there
[2557.20 - 2560.44] they're doing some mm but they're also
[2558.88 - 2561.94] doing whey protein powder which takes
[2560.44 - 2563.38] down your health there's people out
[2561.94 - 2564.76] there they're doing mm and they're doing
[2563.38 - 2566.14] all these nut Butters which sure nut
[2564.76 - 2567.64] Butters are pretty good it's not the
[2566.14 - 2569.86] worst thing now Butters are good for us
[2567.64 - 2571.92] in so many ways right but they're
[2569.86 - 2574.48] drinking gobs and gobs of old
[2571.92 - 2577.06] dilapidated rancid oil that came from
[2574.48 - 2578.74] other places in the world and was bought
[2577.06 - 2582.72] in bulk in a cheap way and then
[2578.74 - 2582.72] impregnated into each bottle
[2583.90 - 2589.42] and so these things knock us down
[2587.02 - 2590.98] there's a thousand things out there in
[2589.42 - 2592.48] the health world that chip away at
[2590.98 - 2595.12] people while their bodies trying to
[2592.48 - 2597.82] fight to survive this is the mm-1500
[2595.12 - 2600.64] it's 100 off let's get into this let's
[2597.82 - 2603.40] start making some nut Butters right now
[2600.64 - 2605.74] let's go
[2603.40 - 2607.98] I'm gonna use this I'm gonna turn this
[2605.74 - 2607.98] on
[2608.26 - 2611.26] Godspeed
[2612.52 - 2615.46] [Music]
[2613.90 - 2617.70] all right which one do I want to make
[2615.46 - 2617.70] first
[2617.80 - 2621.84] let's make some almond butter
[2628.72 - 2631.44] there we go
[2633.16 - 2638.50] look at that this is roasted almonds
[2636.58 - 2641.08] whoa look at that
[2638.50 - 2643.30] take a look you guys I gotta do it nice
[2641.08 - 2646.60] and even so I can get a nice even stick
[2643.30 - 2648.22] look at that what maybe I can get a
[2646.60 - 2651.64] close-up to in a minute
[2648.22 - 2653.50] whoa that's insane
[2651.64 - 2656.26] that's what almond butter is supposed to
[2653.50 - 2658.06] look like there it is everybody and then
[2656.26 - 2660.10] 1500
[2658.06 - 2661.96] spinning basket can't do that the
[2660.10 - 2662.92] spinning basket juicer they can't even
[2661.96 - 2666.48] juice
[2662.92 - 2666.48] um vegetables properly
[2669.28 - 2673.66] what's a medical medium live without a
[2672.22 - 2676.50] little fun
[2673.66 - 2676.50] look at that
[2679.24 - 2681.96] take a look
[2686.14 - 2692.82] the thing is when it comes down to being
[2688.24 - 2692.82] sick every little bit counts
[2692.98 - 2697.54] every little bit counts that means if
[2694.84 - 2699.64] you're going to eat a nut butter
[2697.54 - 2701.86] you want to make sure you're not totally
[2699.64 - 2704.98] being screwed over or taken advantage of
[2701.86 - 2707.50] or ripped off or your body
[2704.98 - 2709.60] being betrayed
[2707.50 - 2711.04] The Nut Butter companies are betraying
[2709.60 - 2713.02] people
[2711.04 - 2715.18] bottom line
[2713.02 - 2716.74] look at look at this Nut Butter right
[2715.18 - 2719.26] here look at these roasts look at the
[2716.74 - 2721.98] roasted almond butter going through here
[2719.26 - 2721.98] look at that
[2722.86 - 2727.20] that's insane right there you guys see
[2724.96 - 2727.20] this
[2728.62 - 2732.82] probably one of the most mind-blowing
[2730.78 - 2734.98] things
[2732.82 - 2736.26] from the mm-1500 link is in the
[2734.98 - 2739.00] description link is in the profile
[2736.26 - 2741.28] Victoria Smith says what is the point of
[2739.00 - 2744.58] companies to put oil in their nut
[2741.28 - 2747.76] Butters confused while they add it
[2744.58 - 2749.32] because they use less nuts which cost
[2747.76 - 2753.28] the nut butter companies a lot of money
[2749.32 - 2757.06] they use less nuts but bring in cheap
[2753.28 - 2759.64] bulk oil that cost them pennies pennies
[2757.06 - 2762.10] and then they mark up the price of your
[2759.64 - 2764.74] nut butter jar stick it on the Shelf at
[2762.10 - 2769.20] Whole Foods or whatever food store and
[2764.74 - 2769.20] you pay for rancid old oil
[2773.14 - 2779.10] how's that for an explanation
[2776.86 - 2781.72] oh fact
[2779.10 - 2784.00] [Music]
[2781.72 - 2785.32] all right you guys I just made some
[2784.00 - 2786.76] almond butter right there let's get a
[2785.32 - 2790.06] close-up on here
[2786.76 - 2793.06] look at that is that just sick
[2790.06 - 2795.46] right where's all that disgusting oil
[2793.06 - 2799.48] that's added later and here's the
[2795.46 - 2802.54] problem it's you can't you can't be sure
[2799.48 - 2805.84] that they're just adding plain old oil
[2802.54 - 2808.30] they could the oil could have garbage in
[2805.84 - 2812.44] it crapping it it's bulk rancid old oils
[2808.30 - 2814.30] in every nut butter out there
[2812.44 - 2817.96] that's what nut butter is supposed to
[2814.30 - 2819.52] look like right there mm-1500 boom if
[2817.96 - 2820.84] you guys are sticking around I want to
[2819.52 - 2822.10] make some more Nut Butter but I want to
[2820.84 - 2823.78] do even more than that I want to make
[2822.10 - 2826.84] three guacamoles I want to make a hummus
[2823.78 - 2828.46] this is the mm 1500 it's 100 off I don't
[2826.84 - 2830.74] know if they're ever gonna do a hundred
[2828.46 - 2832.78] dollars off again
[2830.74 - 2835.00] usually it's sixty dollars off forty
[2832.78 - 2838.06] dollars off or 80 off the biggest I've
[2835.00 - 2840.28] seen is 100 off Baseline says it's so
[2838.06 - 2843.16] messed up and they say on the jar oil
[2840.28 - 2845.98] separation is natural evil
[2843.16 - 2847.90] I can say so much about that comment
[2845.98 - 2850.00] meaning amazing comment I can say so
[2847.90 - 2852.64] much about that I could go to town on
[2850.00 - 2854.98] that but I gotta kind of like keep it
[2852.64 - 2857.86] contained
[2854.98 - 2860.52] got to keep it contained a little bit
[2857.86 - 2860.52] all right
[2861.51 - 2865.30] [Music]

[2986.08 - 2990.78] let's keep on doing it roasted cashews
[2991.96 - 2994.44] let's go
[2998.98 - 3002.64] now
[3000.30 - 3004.20] when you make your own nut Butters it's
[3002.64 - 3005.58] a game changer
[3004.20 - 3008.04] now if you're not going to eat nut
[3005.58 - 3009.66] Butters
[3008.04 - 3012.42] and you're gonna buy a store-bought one
[3009.66 - 3014.16] once in a blue moon don't buy it
[3012.42 - 3017.28] don't buy it
[3014.16 - 3019.38] it's not worth it
[3017.28 - 3021.48] if you give nut Butters to your kids
[3019.38 - 3024.32] your children your family members
[3021.48 - 3024.32] that you want
[3025.38 - 3030.60] then you want something that works
[3028.08 - 3032.90] you want you to make your own
[3030.60 - 3037.08] fresh clean
[3032.90 - 3040.76] non-rancet oils no oils in there rancid
[3037.08 - 3040.76] oils thrown in there to cheapen it
[3041.22 - 3045.36] you guys link is in the profile link is
[3043.14 - 3047.58] in the description
[3045.36 - 3049.44] I'm just making some roasted cashew
[3047.58 - 3052.76] butter
[3049.44 - 3052.76] and then we're gonna move on
[3052.98 - 3058.02] now here's the thing though there's
[3054.78 - 3061.32] people that can't have they don't have
[3058.02 - 3064.02] any options so what I recommend is if
[3061.32 - 3067.02] you buy a nut butter
[3064.02 - 3070.44] if you buy a nut butter which is fine I
[3067.02 - 3073.14] recommend pouring the oil out
[3070.44 - 3075.60] that's something you can do pour the oil
[3073.14 - 3076.98] out like I did so if you see enough
[3075.60 - 3078.54] butter you like because you're going to
[3076.98 - 3079.98] eat nut Butters and you don't have any
[3078.54 - 3082.56] other way to do it you don't have a
[3079.98 - 3084.60] machine that makes your own pour the oil
[3082.56 - 3087.30] out
[3084.60 - 3089.52] so when you get a nut butter
[3087.30 - 3091.38] it's important it doesn't get rid of all
[3089.52 - 3092.88] the oil you know I have a friend the
[3091.38 - 3094.38] other day that said listen I'm gonna eat
[3092.88 - 3096.42] enough butter no matter what I said okay
[3094.38 - 3097.44] then then here's here's some good nut
[3096.42 - 3099.36] Butters
[3097.44 - 3101.58] it's still going to have this oil in it
[3099.36 - 3104.22] it's still going to be oil that's just
[3101.58 - 3105.84] bulk oil that's cheap that's from other
[3104.22 - 3108.54] places around the world that's how it
[3105.84 - 3110.88] works but dump the oil out if you can
[3108.54 - 3113.46] try to dump as much oil
[3110.88 - 3116.28] you possibly can out
[3113.46 - 3118.20] and that's what I tell friends and
[3116.28 - 3120.60] that's why I've even said people come to
[3118.20 - 3123.54] me like look aw I'm gonna eat nut butter
[3120.60 - 3125.82] no matter what I go I got you totally
[3123.54 - 3128.64] understand there's some brands that that
[3125.82 - 3130.44] I like then anyway they're like you know
[3128.64 - 3132.30] some Brands out there I've talked about
[3130.44 - 3134.58] I say look you can look at this brand
[3132.30 - 3136.56] that brand but I tell people I give them
[3134.58 - 3138.54] tips if you're gonna have it anyway dump
[3136.56 - 3139.68] the oil out so what you want to do right
[3138.54 - 3143.10] there
[3139.68 - 3144.84] is you want to dump that oil out
[3143.10 - 3148.08] it's still not going to get rid of all
[3144.84 - 3149.70] of it by far but it gives you a better
[3148.08 - 3152.16] shot because there's people that are
[3149.70 - 3153.60] going to just go and buy it anyway so I
[3152.16 - 3154.98] want to just give them options if
[3153.60 - 3157.80] they're going to do that anyway all
[3154.98 - 3161.16] right so we just did some
[3157.80 - 3163.08] um roasted cashew butter that's roasted
[3161.16 - 3165.96] cashew butter
[3163.08 - 3168.78] now here's raw cashews you can make a
[3165.96 - 3172.04] raw cashew nut butter as well so there's
[3168.78 - 3172.04] raw cashews
[3172.68 - 3175.98] into
[3174.18 - 3178.86] some little jars really quick I could
[3175.98 - 3180.72] pack this one in so here's the cashew

[3302.70 - 3309.62] which I'm totally

[3315.24 - 3320.52] we're moving along
[3317.88 - 3321.96] I have a mess on the floor
[3320.52 - 3323.16] I have a mess on the floor and I have a
[3321.96 - 3326.04] towel on the floor and I'm kind of
[3323.16 - 3329.54] kicking it around right now
[3326.04 - 3329.54] and I want to get rid of these
[3332.70 - 3335.70] nice
[3338.10 - 3342.80] all right you guys
[3340.08 - 3342.80] Let's Roll
[3346.20 - 3349.92] time to make some hummus who eats hummus
[3348.18 - 3352.08] just want to ask you guys
[3349.92 - 3355.02] something you eat once in a while is it
[3352.08 - 3357.84] something you eat a lot of now I don't
[3355.02 - 3360.84] like to buy store-bought hummus because
[3357.84 - 3363.66] of all the stuff that's in it the amount
[3360.84 - 3368.00] of junk and garbage that's in a
[3363.66 - 3368.00] store-bought hummus it's really scary
[3369.30 - 3373.92] actually frightening to tell you the
[3370.86 - 3376.80] truth okay so I got chickpeas right here
[3373.92 - 3378.48] I want to show you guys
[3376.80 - 3380.88] you can make black bean hummus lentil
[3378.48 - 3382.80] hummus these are garbanzo beans
[3380.88 - 3384.60] chickpeas this is the kind of hummus I'm
[3382.80 - 3387.72] making right now
[3384.60 - 3389.04] it's going to make a simple hummus I'm
[3387.72 - 3390.84] going to take orders what would you like
[3389.04 - 3392.94] in your hummus is there anything
[3390.84 - 3394.44] particular you see I got different herbs
[3392.94 - 3396.96] here
[3394.44 - 3398.58] um I got lime lemon do you like lime in
[3396.96 - 3399.54] your hummus or do you like lemon in your
[3398.58 - 3401.88] hummus
[3399.54 - 3403.86] do you like garlic in your hummus
[3401.88 - 3406.98] I think what I'm gonna do is grab a
[3403.86 - 3408.96] garlic clove now and get it ready
[3406.98 - 3411.38] how much garlic do you like in your
[3408.96 - 3411.38] hummus
[3412.26 - 3415.04] you like a lot
[3415.68 - 3419.88] or a little
[3417.42 - 3421.62] I tend to like a lot
[3419.88 - 3423.42] but I've seen you know people where it's
[3421.62 - 3425.16] like whoa too much that's way too much
[3423.42 - 3427.68] garlic I don't like my hummus with that
[3425.16 - 3430.26] much garlic in there okay now what
[3427.68 - 3434.76] you'll see here is instead of putting
[3430.26 - 3436.38] tahini I am going to put sesame seeds
[3434.76 - 3438.78] one thing you're not going to get with
[3436.38 - 3441.66] sesame seeds is all that added
[3438.78 - 3444.54] gnarly oil you're not gonna have that
[3441.66 - 3447.06] it's just the seeds plus the sesame
[3444.54 - 3448.86] seeds have so much flavor you can just
[3447.06 - 3451.62] add a little bit into your hummus in the
[3448.86 - 3453.78] mm-1500 and it'll actually grind it all
[3451.62 - 3456.36] together it'll get that flavor all
[3453.78 - 3457.80] through the hummus so that's what I'm
[3456.36 - 3460.32] going to add I have people coming over
[3457.80 - 3463.28] later they like salt I want to
[3460.32 - 3466.02] accommodate anybody whoever comes over
[3463.28 - 3468.06] and I will make them anything they want
[3466.02 - 3470.90] I promise that the hummus would have
[3468.06 - 3470.90] some salt in it
[3470.94 - 3475.98] so I'm going to find the salt in a
[3474.36 - 3478.52] little bit here it is
[3475.98 - 3478.52] all right
[3480.66 - 3485.70] in a making decision right now what do I
[3482.94 - 3488.76] want in here lemon or lime I think I'm
[3485.70 - 3490.62] gonna go with a lemon
[3488.76 - 3493.98] and I'm going to cut that lemon in half
[3490.62 - 3495.24] and get it ready there we go
[3493.98 - 3497.64] okay
[3495.24 - 3499.20] and the other decision is am I going to
[3497.64 - 3502.38] put herbs in here
[3499.20 - 3504.86] yes I am I'm gonna do a little bit of
[3502.38 - 3504.86] Basil
[3505.80 - 3510.78] we'll see we'll see
[3508.20 - 3512.28] maybe none at all
[3510.78 - 3514.76] all right
[3512.28 - 3514.76] Let's Roll
[3518.28 - 3522.26] extremely low-fat hummus
[3524.94 - 3531.60] hummus in the store usually has a mix of
[3528.18 - 3535.62] canola and olive oil
[3531.60 - 3537.90] canola oil declines your health
[3535.62 - 3540.90] I've written about this for years in the
[3537.90 - 3542.16] medical medium books
[3540.90 - 3544.50] right

[3605.88 - 3612.24] you're not burdening it with all that
[3608.28 - 3614.40] fat you're not killing your pancreas
[3612.24 - 3617.10] one of the things that happens out there
[3614.40 - 3619.32] is people their pancreas just takes the
[3617.10 - 3621.36] licking and takes a licking and one day
[3619.32 - 3623.64] their pancreas says I can't do it
[3621.36 - 3626.60] anymore you've been killing me without

[3900.60 - 3903.44] I'm a little nervous
[3903.72 - 3908.46] guacamole time
[3906.48 - 3911.78] all right
[3908.46 - 3911.78] I'm gonna use
[3912.24 - 3915.50] this bowl right here
[3917.16 - 3922.20] okay I got some avocados I want to give
[3919.74 - 3923.76] you guys a couple of avocado tips
[3922.20 - 3926.46] when is
[3923.76 - 3928.26] I've showed you this before
[3926.46 - 3930.54] you'll see there's a butt where the stem
[3928.26 - 3933.18] was so the avocado was hanging off the
[3930.54 - 3935.46] tree and the stem went like this and it
[3933.18 - 3937.98] was attached to the avocado and then
[3935.46 - 3939.66] when they Twisted it off or it was cut
[3937.98 - 3942.54] off the stem
[3939.66 - 3944.94] the avocado Growers it left the piece of
[3942.54 - 3946.80] the stem right there and what I see
[3944.94 - 3949.02] happen with people's guacamole is
[3946.80 - 3951.60] they're not prepared to bite on such a
[3949.02 - 3954.36] hard knobby thing and when people make
[3951.60 - 3955.32] their guacamole that knob see I just
[3954.36 - 3957.96] took it off
[3955.32 - 3960.00] then knob goes in the guacamole
[3957.96 - 3961.92] so many people
[3960.00 - 3963.96] had that happen a friend of mine was at
[3961.92 - 3965.46] a restaurant in La and was eating
[3963.96 - 3967.20] guacamole
[3965.46 - 3970.86] with his friend
[3967.20 - 3972.12] and he watched his friend bite onto that
[3970.86 - 3974.88] very thing
[3972.12 - 3975.84] that was in the guacamole and like bit
[3974.88 - 3978.42] it
[3975.84 - 3980.46] injured themselves bit their tongue bit
[3978.42 - 3982.14] their lip it was the weirdest thing he
[3980.46 - 3984.06] said it was the strangest thing they
[3982.14 - 3986.52] took a look at what it was and they went
[3984.06 - 3987.96] they were like we want to show you what
[3986.52 - 3989.94] was in your guacamole and they're like
[3987.96 - 3992.82] that's weird how did that get in there
[3989.94 - 3994.32] that's because chefs do it all the time
[3992.82 - 3997.20] as they're making and preparing
[3994.32 - 3998.70] guacamole that knob actually ends up in
[3997.20 - 4001.34] the food
[3998.70 - 4003.80] and so many people's guacamoles here's
[4001.34 - 4006.62] another one right here
[4003.80 - 4008.24] I'm taking this one off there it is make
[4006.62 - 4010.28] sure you remove it before you start
[4008.24 - 4012.26] making your guacamole in your bowl or
[4010.28 - 4014.24] whatever you're doing all right cutting
[4012.26 - 4018.08] open these avocados
[4014.24 - 4019.76] preparing them really quick it's easy
[4018.08 - 4025.10] and we're gonna make
[4019.76 - 4028.48] a really basic good guacamole at first
[4025.10 - 4028.48] so right now I'm doing this
[4028.88 - 4031.66] let's get another one
[4033.44 - 4037.30] wonderful
[4034.76 - 4037.30] okay
[4040.34 - 4043.00] all right
[4043.64 - 4046.88] so
[4044.96 - 4048.44] there's the avocado half I'm just taking
[4046.88 - 4051.56] a spoon you can take any spoon you want
[4048.44 - 4054.44] in there removing that
[4051.56 - 4057.02] I'm gonna put that down in there
[4054.44 - 4059.66] these are not fermented these are not
[4057.02 - 4062.00] spoiled
[4059.66 - 4064.16] what happens to a lot of people is they
[4062.00 - 4065.78] buy them dark do not buy your avocados
[4064.16 - 4067.70] dark like this unless you're taking a
[4065.78 - 4069.98] risk because you're gonna this is one
[4067.70 - 4072.50] that actually is over ripe in my hand
[4069.98 - 4074.30] you buy these over ripe you get a bad
[4072.50 - 4077.18] experience what happens is the avocados
[4074.30 - 4079.10] fermented it's spoiled it'll have dark
[4077.18 - 4080.90] spots or if it doesn't have dark spots
[4079.10 - 4083.12] in there it could be fermented anyway
[4080.90 - 4084.62] and you have a bad experience a poor
[4083.12 - 4086.90] experience with your guacamole not even
[4084.62 - 4091.34] realize it you're eating spoiled rancid
[4086.90 - 4093.44] old avocado and you don't even know it
[4091.34 - 4095.36] so what you're seeing here these are not
[4093.44 - 4098.54] these even though there's a dark spot
[4095.36 - 4100.64] right there these are still good
[4098.54 - 4103.70] there's a difference between a dark spot
[4100.64 - 4105.62] and totally Rancid
[4103.70 - 4107.66] it's you can actually take out like a
[4105.62 - 4108.50] little dark spot if you want but there
[4107.66 - 4110.42] we go
[4108.50 - 4113.86] all right
[4110.42 - 4113.86] I'm gonna do some lime
[4115.70 - 4121.10] maybe uh let me crack open another lemon
[4119.42 - 4124.10] I'll do a blend of a little lime and
[4121.10 - 4126.64] lemon with this one here
[4124.10 - 4126.64] okay
[4126.74 - 4130.28] all right so the attachment for this if
[4128.72 - 4132.14] you've done the if you actually own the
[4130.28 - 4135.08] mm 1500
[4132.14 - 4137.24] do you own the mm-1500 there's a little
[4135.08 - 4139.22] attachment right here
[4137.24 - 4141.20] trying to get it out there it is that's
[4139.22 - 4143.66] the one I'm making hummus
[4141.20 - 4146.06] that's the one I'm making guacamolean
[4143.66 - 4147.56] it's this little attachment you'll see a
[4146.06 - 4148.46] little bit of the hummus left over in
[4147.56 - 4151.40] there
[4148.46 - 4153.92] see if I can push that out
[4151.40 - 4155.24] I'm gonna put it back on the front
[4153.92 - 4158.26] okay
[4155.24 - 4158.26] this piece on
[4158.42 - 4161.14] here we go
[4161.90 - 4166.60] all right let's roll three hummus that
[4164.72 - 4169.28] not hummus is sorry three
[4166.60 - 4172.04] guacamole's to make
[4169.28 - 4173.72] we're live
[4172.04 - 4175.64] it's a little bit of that left over and
[4173.72 - 4177.62] then we go
[4175.64 - 4180.76] this is so great
[4177.62 - 4180.76] pop another half in
[4182.42 - 4187.28] I'm making a basic one
[4184.28 - 4190.16] for people that just like a basic one
[4187.28 - 4191.84] that's all they like
[4190.16 - 4194.06] they don't want anything in there they
[4191.84 - 4195.74] don't want medicine in there they don't
[4194.06 - 4198.26] want
[4195.74 - 4200.24] anything fun in there they don't want
[4198.26 - 4203.68] spicy they don't want anything right
[4200.24 - 4203.68] they just want salt
[4205.04 - 4209.78] and lemon
[4207.74 - 4211.64] a lot of people have the most basic
[4209.78 - 4213.86] guacamole
[4211.64 - 4215.96] and that's fine
[4213.86 - 4219.22] or they want lime
[4215.96 - 4219.22] I have a lime right here
[4220.16 - 4225.62] so what I'm doing popping these pits out
[4223.34 - 4228.22] let's keep it coming
[4225.62 - 4228.22] there we go
[4230.66 - 4234.46] I'm gonna squeeze the lime in there
[4238.90 - 4243.26] a little bit of lime down in there like
[4241.40 - 4245.06] that you guys see
[4243.26 - 4247.72] and I'm gonna put a little bit of salt
[4245.06 - 4247.72] down there too
[4247.82 - 4251.02] salt and lime
[4253.40 - 4257.38] all right this one's done
[4260.32 - 4264.46] let's pop in some more in here
[4267.44 - 4270.04] there you go
[4270.56 - 4272.80] foreign
[4274.64 - 4281.02] that's a lime
[4276.98 - 4281.02] a little bit of sea salt
[4284.48 - 4289.76] that's just a plain
[4286.90 - 4291.68] clean guacamole
[4289.76 - 4295.10] what you won't find in there is like
[4291.68 - 4298.22] cheese milk sour cream
[4295.10 - 4300.44] any kind of crazy oils olive oil is
[4298.22 - 4302.66] added into guacamole all the time it
[4300.44 - 4304.82] shouldn't be it should just be like
[4302.66 - 4308.32] fresh and clean just like that you can
[4304.82 - 4308.32] put fresh herbs on top if you like
[4308.62 - 4314.36] okay
[4310.34 - 4318.34] I'm gonna put it in this guacamole Bowl
[4314.36 - 4318.34] and then pop some fresh herbs on top
[4318.74 - 4322.30] and a little bit extra lime
[4323.78 - 4327.32] a little bit
[4325.28 - 4329.84] Sprague
[4327.32 - 4333.68] there of sea salt I kept the garlic out
[4329.84 - 4335.42] of this one this is a real basic one
[4333.68 - 4338.26] and then you can put any kind of fresh
[4335.42 - 4338.26] herb you want
[4338.42 - 4343.48] cilantro basil anything
[4343.58 - 4346.58] foreign
[4348.22 - 4353.56] cilantro basil
[4350.96 - 4353.56] chives
[4355.34 - 4357.82] all right
[4365.30 - 4371.66] and I'm gonna pop some lime on top
[4368.06 - 4373.16] because as you know guacamole
[4371.66 - 4376.04] it's going to be sitting there for a
[4373.16 - 4377.90] while and I want to keep it looking as
[4376.04 - 4380.24] fresh as possible and there we are right
[4377.90 - 4384.46] there that's going to go in this tray
[4380.24 - 4384.46] I'm gonna get another one rolling now
[4385.16 - 4387.64] okay
[4389.12 - 4391.90] all right next
[4392.96 - 4397.12] this next one is the medicine guacamole
[4398.00 - 4402.62] the difference with this one is it's
[4400.34 - 4404.36] going to have a lot of intense herbs in
[4402.62 - 4406.52] it
[4404.36 - 4409.42] you want to make the most out of every
[4406.52 - 4409.42] meal you have
[4414.14 - 4418.78] so what I'm doing is cutting open a few
[4415.70 - 4418.78] avocados really quick
[4419.06 - 4425.42] I didn't want to pre-cut them because I
[4421.94 - 4427.10] didn't want them oxidizing you know when
[4425.42 - 4429.92] you actually open an avocado if you let
[4427.10 - 4431.24] it sit too long it starts to oxidize I
[4429.92 - 4432.98] didn't want that to happen so you guys
[4431.24 - 4436.60] got to hang in there while I just knock
[4432.98 - 4436.60] out a few of these like this real quick
[4436.82 - 4439.42] there we go
[4439.70 - 4443.14] that one's a bad avocado
[4443.78 - 4446.80] bad avocado
[4447.26 - 4453.16] that's a good one right there
[4450.26 - 4453.16] let's get another one
[4457.70 - 4462.76] got one right there a little iffy but
[4459.86 - 4462.76] I'm gonna hold on to it
[4464.36 - 4467.96] of course is they're dropped all the
[4466.28 - 4470.24] time on the floor and then the produce
[4467.96 - 4472.34] guy comes around and he puts them back
[4470.24 - 4475.04] up and then people come around and they
[4472.34 - 4476.54] they're going to get their avocados and
[4475.04 - 4479.06] they drop
[4476.54 - 4480.56] a whole bunch on the floor and that's
[4479.06 - 4482.12] one thing that happens or they squeeze
[4480.56 - 4483.80] them people go in and they're squeezing
[4482.12 - 4485.60] their avocados all the time all right
[4483.80 - 4489.50] let's roll
[4485.60 - 4492.88] so I'm putting herbs in with this one
[4489.50 - 4492.88] give me a lot more intense

[4497.30 - 4502.58] 1500 it's 100 off I don't think I don't
[4500.18 - 4505.64] know if they'll ever do that again
[4502.58 - 4508.76] 100 off is definitely pretty crazy
[4505.64 - 4510.56] I've not seen a sale on this model this
[4508.76 - 4513.58] unit
[4510.56 - 4513.58] ever like that

[4949.94 - 4953.72] I mean you can knock out so many
[4951.50 - 4956.24] guacamoles like this
[4953.72 - 4959.42] if you have your stuff ready you could
[4956.24 - 4961.70] just boom knock these babies out
[4959.42 - 4963.56] so we've got another one here
[4961.70 - 4967.12] all right
[4963.56 - 4967.12] turning the lightning speed for you guys
[4968.90 - 4972.26] all right let's roll
[4970.40 - 4975.04] this one's a spicy hot one I'm gonna get
[4972.26 - 4975.04] these cayennes
[4975.38 - 4983.48] so one Cayenne in a guacamole this size
[4979.70 - 4984.50] is already probably too spicy like one
[4983.48 - 4986.60] of these
[4984.50 - 4989.74] I'm gonna put
[4986.60 - 4989.74] three in there
[4990.86 - 4995.66] okay
[4991.94 - 4998.06] it's going to be really hot really spicy
[4995.66 - 4999.38] I don't recommend doing that though like
[4998.06 - 5001.24] at your house if this is what you're
[4999.38 - 5004.96] gonna do just put like a little bit if
[5001.24 - 5009.04] you're into it but don't overdo it
[5004.96 - 5012.12] foreign because that's a lot
[5009.04 - 5012.12] all right let's roll
[5018.88 - 5022.50] it's gonna be the spicy one
[5027.82 - 5033.64] here we go
[5029.64 - 5036.94] when it comes down to chronic illness
[5033.64 - 5039.34] and someone's really struggling
[5036.94 - 5043.26] if they
[5039.34 - 5043.26] if they give their body what it needs
[5045.00 - 5048.24] their body
[5049.24 - 5053.02] knows
[5050.80 - 5054.28] it knows you're trying to give it what
[5053.02 - 5057.04] it needs
[5054.28 - 5061.02] it knows you're working hard on it
[5057.04 - 5061.02] communication with your immune system
[5062.26 - 5066.22] is important because every time you do
[5064.36 - 5068.38] something good for yourself tell your
[5066.22 - 5072.96] body that you're doing it
[5068.38 - 5072.96] I am going to make a medicine guacamole
[5073.96 - 5078.28] talk to your immune system I'm going to
[5076.12 - 5079.02] make a medicine guacamole for my immune
[5078.28 - 5080.98] system
[5079.02 - 5083.20] [Music]
[5080.98 - 5084.64] I'm putting a garlic clove in this one
[5083.20 - 5087.12] so not only is it going to have the
[5084.64 - 5087.12] Cayenne
[5089.80 - 5094.88] the garlic in it as well
[5091.68 - 5094.88] [Music]
[5104.86 - 5108.82] now
[5106.96 - 5110.86] [Music]
[5108.82 - 5113.26] what happens is that if you're going to
[5110.86 - 5114.76] be not eating avocados that's fine if
[5113.26 - 5117.40] you're going to be doing something like
[5114.76 - 5119.02] the 369 or the 28 day cleanse without
[5117.40 - 5122.14] the avocado if you're going to be doing
[5119.02 - 5124.18] a 369 or a mono eating cleanse without
[5122.14 - 5125.74] avocado because you're working on a
[5124.18 - 5128.58] deeper level of your healing process
[5125.74 - 5128.58] that's incredible
[5128.98 - 5134.26] but if you're gonna eat a guacamole in
[5131.50 - 5138.12] between or some avocado on a salad and
[5134.26 - 5138.12] make it as medicinal as possible
[5149.52 - 5156.24] all right got the garlic clove in here
[5152.26 - 5156.24] let me add some lemon in here too
[5158.32 - 5162.42] let me add some lime in here as well
[5163.42 - 5168.70] and I got to get the Cayenne in here
[5166.36 - 5169.56] I'm taking off the
[5168.70 - 5177.27] bottoms
[5169.56 - 5177.27] [Music]
[5181.27 - 5187.24] [Music]
[5184.32 - 5189.64] it's gonna be hot I'm actually getting a
[5187.24 - 5193.24] little bit worried on how hot this is
[5189.64 - 5194.80] 100 off the link is in the bio and in
[5193.24 - 5198.46] the description
[5194.80 - 5198.46] on the mm-1500

[5205.60 - 5210.18] a little bit of sea salt in there and
[5207.70 - 5210.18] then we're good

[5222.46 - 5226.38] chance

[5230.52 - 5238.50] guacamole right there let me get it into
[5234.76 - 5238.50] this little Bowl here
[5239.16 - 5242.46] there you go
[5244.66 - 5250.12] I'm actually nervous about that one
[5247.54 - 5253.48] that thing is going to be a real hot
[5250.12 - 5258.12] let me get the tray out here we go
[5253.48 - 5258.12] that's the real spicy one right there
[5258.46 - 5262.14] you guys I'm gonna try it
[5264.04 - 5267.00] a little nervous
[5272.68 - 5274.68] um
[5275.62 - 5278.82] I need something drank
[5279.70 - 5283.14] I gotta drink something hold on guys
[5284.02 - 5287.94] that thing is freaking hot
[5290.14 - 5294.46] you guys I got celery juice I got celery
[5293.02 - 5296.94] juice that I was drinking before I went
[5294.46 - 5296.94] on this live
[5297.46 - 5300.82] I just have to have some I just I have
[5299.68 - 5304.54] to
[5300.82 - 5306.10] because that is really really hot
[5304.54 - 5307.48] I'm gonna take this piece of broccoli
[5306.10 - 5310.80] and I'm gonna stick it in this really
[5307.48 - 5310.80] spicy guacamole here
[5312.46 - 5315.64] um
[5313.78 - 5317.86] yeah those are from my garden those are
[5315.64 - 5320.44] hot peppers from my garden and the herbs
[5317.86 - 5323.46] are from my garden
[5320.44 - 5323.46] well that's insane
[5323.80 - 5327.24] oh that's that bites you
[5328.48 - 5331.66] I mean you guys there's probably some of
[5330.16 - 5333.28] you that like eat so many hot peppers
[5331.66 - 5335.14] you think I'm like probably a wuss or
[5333.28 - 5337.48] something and you're saying like well no
[5335.14 - 5339.10] aw is a wuss because you just put three
[5337.48 - 5340.54] big cayennes in there and it can't be
[5339.10 - 5342.64] that hot
[5340.54 - 5344.32] but for some reason this Cayenne have
[5342.64 - 5347.62] been growing in the garden has been
[5344.32 - 5349.36] insane it's it's actually not every just
[5347.62 - 5351.22] because if you go look up cayenne I'm
[5349.36 - 5353.02] like right
[5351.22 - 5354.64] and you look at the heat units right and
[5353.02 - 5357.16] you're like oh what does it have and it
[5354.64 - 5358.72] says it'll have 95 000 or it'll have
[5357.16 - 5360.40] whatever it'll say
[5358.72 - 5362.44] I mean don't quote me on that whatever's
[5360.40 - 5364.30] out there but just so you know one
[5362.44 - 5366.70] Cayenne can be a lot hotter than another
[5364.30 - 5368.92] Cayenne one Cayenne plant can be an
[5366.70 - 5371.32] entirely different heat level than
[5368.92 - 5373.60] another one depending on the soil
[5371.32 - 5376.54] and so many different factors for some
[5373.60 - 5378.64] reason these cayennes are like dangerous
[5376.54 - 5382.14] they're way hotter but I'm gonna have a
[5378.64 - 5382.14] little bit more because I can't help it
[5382.72 - 5385.72] foreign
[5392.68 - 5396.52] flower jasmine says best part of a mega
