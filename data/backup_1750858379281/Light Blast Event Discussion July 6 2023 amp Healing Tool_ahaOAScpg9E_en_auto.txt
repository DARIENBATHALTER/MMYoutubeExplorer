[395.10 - 400.62] like transformational stuff
[398.04 - 404.10] seriously
[400.62 - 407.22] July 12th registration opens for it
[404.10 - 409.26] to not miss it it's a seven day Journey
[407.22 - 414.32] I'm taking you on
[409.26 - 414.32] come on it's going to be so fun I swear
[414.42 - 422.94] we have a very tough sweet potato here
[418.56 - 425.60] and I'm just gonna be careful
[422.94 - 427.50] be very careful
[425.60 - 429.12] [Music]
[427.50 - 430.44] don't want to mess around with these
[429.12 - 433.74] sweet potatoes you don't want to cut
[430.44 - 436.20] them wrong you don't want to mess up
[433.74 - 437.90] you know what happened was after the
[436.20 - 441.42] light blast
[437.90 - 445.08] I was calm
[441.42 - 448.46] I just stayed in my chair
[445.08 - 448.46] I stayed in my chair
[449.04 - 454.20] and then stayed in my chair and stayed
[451.80 - 456.42] in my chair I didn't get up but I didn't
[454.20 - 461.84] get up for a long time
[456.42 - 461.84] I just soaked it in and I just sat there
[462.18 - 466.20] and
[463.44 - 467.52] it was a feeling I Can't Describe I'm
[466.20 - 469.44] still trying to actually describe it
[467.52 - 472.50] which leads me to this what's going to
[469.44 - 475.44] happen with a lot of you guys
[472.50 - 477.90] is things are going to unravel after the
[475.44 - 479.70] light blast and I've seen this happen so
[477.90 - 484.50] many times where
[479.70 - 486.66] it a week later you start feeling all
[484.50 - 488.40] these results from it two weeks later
[486.66 - 490.92] you start feeling all these results from
[488.40 - 495.00] it a month later it's still carrying on
[490.92 - 497.16] or things start happening a month later
[495.00 - 499.56] it works different in every single
[497.16 - 502.50] person because we're not all the same no
[499.56 - 504.42] one is the same as another person we're
[502.50 - 505.98] not all the same some people are going
[504.42 - 507.42] to see the light some people are
[505.98 - 508.50] actually going to feel it in their hands
[507.42 - 509.64] some people are going to feel it
[508.50 - 511.20] instantly in their neck they're going to
[509.64 - 512.82] feel it run through them
[511.20 - 514.44] they're gonna sleep better tonight
[512.82 - 515.82] they're going to have deeper Dreams
[514.44 - 517.68] they're gonna have vivid dreams they're
[515.82 - 520.02] going to have experiences everybody's
[517.68 - 523.26] different it's going to be like that so
[520.02 - 525.00] just remember as each day goes on how
[523.26 - 527.36] things are going to be different along
[525.00 - 527.36] the way
[528.18 - 535.14] for each person no one is the same
[532.68 - 536.10] you have emotional experiences someone
[535.14 - 538.68] else
[536.10 - 540.18] doesn't have someone else has emotional
[538.68 - 543.42] experiences and wounds and they're soul
[540.18 - 545.22] that someone else doesn't have
[543.42 - 548.46] and that's how it works
[545.22 - 551.28] someone asks what is the light blast we
[548.46 - 553.32] just did the light blast
[551.28 - 556.58] we just did it
[553.32 - 559.62] this morning Eastern Time afternoon
[556.58 - 561.12] Pacific time
[559.62 - 562.92] and it's something you want to
[561.12 - 565.26] experience get on the newsletter so you
[562.92 - 567.60] can learn about it because I want to do
[565.26 - 573.24] another one
[567.60 - 576.84] a hundred and ten thousand people
[573.24 - 579.62] we're on the light blast today a hundred
[576.84 - 583.86] and ten thousand people
[579.62 - 585.90] 33 000 people signed up registered for
[583.86 - 589.58] the light blast
[585.90 - 589.58] 33 000 people
[590.04 - 594.90] and what happened was
[592.08 - 598.70] over a hundred and ten thousand people
[594.90 - 598.70] ended up at the life blast
[601.08 - 605.64] because people gave out the link
[603.54 - 608.22] remember when I remember when I said
[605.64 - 610.38] something about that try not to give out
[608.22 - 612.54] the link I'm trying to say it in a
[610.38 - 614.10] really nice way please don't give out
[612.54 - 616.50] the link
[614.10 - 618.36] because if you give out the link you're
[616.50 - 620.70] probably gonna crash our technology
[618.36 - 622.08] because we only have technology enough
[620.70 - 624.90] for
[622.08 - 629.34] with technology not from technology
[624.90 - 632.16] experts telling us that 33 000 people 30
[629.34 - 635.58] 000 people was Max on this one that
[632.16 - 639.08] signed up but we let it go to 33 000
[635.58 - 639.08] people for the sign up
[641.64 - 646.56] but what happened was lots of people
[643.98 - 649.20] shared the link gave the link out and it
[646.56 - 652.04] ended up ended up over a hundred and ten
[649.20 - 654.84] thousand people were on
[652.04 - 657.12] but what happens when that happened is
[654.84 - 659.34] it ends up starting to break down the
[657.12 - 661.98] system a little bit and then some people
[659.34 - 662.61] they lose a connection or something it
[661.98 - 664.50] can happen
[662.61 - 667.92] [Music]
[664.50 - 671.60] all right so we still have some turmeric
[667.92 - 671.60] to put in and I I apologize
[671.82 - 675.78] I apologize to anyone who could not get
[674.40 - 677.46] on and we're going to do another light
[675.78 - 679.92] blast and we're gonna do one fairly soon
[677.46 - 684.48] not a long time from now but fairly soon
[679.92 - 686.58] so I apologize my greatest apology to
[684.48 - 688.08] anyone that that couldn't get on that
[686.58 - 689.64] registered and couldn't get on or
[688.08 - 691.62] registered and just it couldn't happen
[689.64 - 694.20] for them like my greatest apology
[691.62 - 696.36] seriously I feel really awful about that
[694.20 - 697.80] if they if they couldn't get on
[696.36 - 700.14] we're working on improving the
[697.80 - 702.24] technology so people can actually get on
[700.14 - 703.50] and not have that problem I'm just
[702.24 - 705.24] letting you know it's good to see you
[703.50 - 707.04] guys I'm making the healing broth right
[705.24 - 708.66] now I'm making it out of the brain saver
[707.04 - 710.10] protocols book I'm not going to talk
[708.66 - 711.48] about the brain saver protocol book
[710.10 - 712.68] we're talking about the light blast but
[711.48 - 715.44] if you don't have this book you're
[712.68 - 718.08] missing out get this book from Amazon or
[715.44 - 720.78] from the library whatever Library
[718.08 - 722.76] just get the book okay when you can
[720.78 - 724.86] you'll be mind blown about that but it's
[722.76 - 726.72] not about that it's about
[724.86 - 729.54] would happen today with the light blast
[726.72 - 732.48] often maxner says I cried like a baby
[729.54 - 734.40] but I feel like I have a fresh start I
[732.48 - 737.22] feel like I have a fresh shirt too when
[734.40 - 739.80] you said there was 10 people left I felt
[737.22 - 741.72] like I'm getting I'm getting chills and
[739.80 - 743.04] I'm getting emotional right now with you
[741.72 - 744.96] saying that when you feel like there's
[743.04 - 747.90] 10 people left
[744.96 - 750.66] 10 people left what what you're saying
[747.90 - 752.64] if if no one understands what that means
[750.66 - 753.84] is that as the light was going through
[752.64 - 755.82] everybody
[753.84 - 760.32] there were a lot of scragglers there
[755.82 - 763.10] were people that were they were
[760.32 - 766.56] how should I say it tough cookies
[763.10 - 768.66] lots of heartbreak old heartbreak lots
[766.56 - 771.30] of emotional wounds lots of soul wounds
[768.66 - 774.12] lots of Soul injuries
[771.30 - 776.64] lots of Confrontation things in their
[774.12 - 777.54] life look even abuse all kinds of
[776.64 - 778.80] different things that have been
[777.54 - 780.84] happening in their life maybe they were
[778.80 - 783.66] gaslit forever in their life all these
[780.84 - 786.00] years whatever it is broken trust issues
[783.66 - 787.98] betrayal
[786.00 - 789.54] relationship breakups relationship
[787.98 - 791.34] problems whether it's divorces or
[789.54 - 793.86] breakups or friendships
[791.34 - 795.84] or business partners whatever it is so
[793.86 - 797.28] many people had so many wounds and the
[795.84 - 799.20] world is getting tougher and what
[797.28 - 801.06] happened was when that light went
[799.20 - 803.76] through people and it hit the crown of
[801.06 - 806.64] their head and it ran through them it
[803.76 - 809.76] just it blew up that stuff to get it out
[806.64 - 813.00] of them it literally sent shrapnel out
[809.76 - 814.38] it sent debris out of their body and
[813.00 - 816.42] that's why I was saying you got to kind
[814.38 - 818.58] of like shake the air a little bit
[816.42 - 820.14] because it was blowing that much out of
[818.58 - 822.78] people
[820.14 - 824.84] and it was that intense and the 10
[822.78 - 828.84] people left were the toughest cookies
[824.84 - 830.88] the ones with a lot of injuries a lot of
[828.84 - 832.14] Heartache a lot of betrayal that
[830.88 - 835.94] happened in their life a lot of broken
[832.14 - 835.94] trust and those 10 people
[836.40 - 842.28] they it all blew out of them by the end
[839.76 - 845.16] it was just boom that debris came out
[842.28 - 848.16] that hurt that wound all of it came out
[845.16 - 850.20] right at the end there that was the last
[848.16 - 852.96] 10 people there were a few people that
[850.20 - 854.64] went through close to the beginning went
[852.96 - 855.78] right through them where the light goes
[854.64 - 857.94] right through the crown of their head
[855.78 - 859.92] runs through the body runs out of their
[857.94 - 863.34] feet into the ground there was a bunch
[859.92 - 867.12] of those but not a lot everybody had a
[863.34 - 868.98] blockage everybody had a blockage
[867.12 - 870.24] and some people as they were blocked
[868.98 - 871.56] here they're blocked here are some
[870.24 - 875.00] people didn't even get through their
[871.56 - 875.00] head right at the beginning

[894.72 - 899.10] Zen veteran says I felt stop in the
[897.42 - 901.68] chest and you felt the light stop in
[899.10 - 903.84] your chest then you felt it stop in the
[901.68 - 906.30] heart then you felt it stop in the
[903.84 - 907.44] stomach and then it went all the way
[906.30 - 909.86] through
[907.44 - 913.20] that's what it was doing that's the kind
[909.86 - 915.24] of that's the kind of experiences that
[913.20 - 916.92] was happening and spirit of compassion
[915.24 - 919.26] was telling me that light was getting
[916.92 - 920.76] locked up in people the third one was
[919.26 - 922.86] starting to really get through people
[920.76 - 924.48] then it was Amplified then the fourth
[922.86 - 927.12] one then it was Amplified and the more
[924.48 - 930.30] people were freed

[1038.18 - 1042.92] online so I got the end of it I want to
[1041.12 - 1046.10] do it again I will try to make sure we
[1042.92 - 1047.72] do it again soon not later but soon I
[1046.10 - 1052.00] feel really bad for a lot of people that
[1047.72 - 1054.68] could not get in to the light blast
[1052.00 - 1056.48] Laura says I feel infused over there on
[1054.68 - 1060.20] Facebook
[1056.48 - 1062.42] you did cry after the first blast
[1060.20 - 1064.40] well if you if you're you were there for
[1062.42 - 1067.60] a oh my God at the first blast you'd be
[1064.40 - 1067.60] the very first that came down

[1071.54 - 1074.08] guys don't mind
[1077.00 - 1083.42] loan says over there on Facebook why do
[1080.54 - 1086.24] we cry during the light blast
[1083.42 - 1091.58] so much is Letting Go
[1086.24 - 1095.90] we bury we bury we stuff inside we hide
[1091.58 - 1098.84] we put aside we put deep
[1095.90 - 1101.06] deep the emotional wounds because you
[1098.84 - 1103.16] have to move forward
[1101.06 - 1105.20] you can't live in the hurt in the moment
[1103.16 - 1106.64] so we have to pick up our our feet we
[1105.20 - 1110.30] got to move forward
[1106.64 - 1114.04] but what happens is over the years
[1110.30 - 1114.04] it builds up inside of us
[1114.32 - 1118.82] some people might not feel much at first
[1116.60 - 1120.98] but then they'll feel it and see the
[1118.82 - 1122.60] changes in the coming days weeks and
[1120.98 - 1126.04] months
[1122.60 - 1126.04] let's get some garlic in here
[1129.38 - 1133.64] we stuff it inside
[1131.48 - 1135.44] we stuff it inside
[1133.64 - 1137.60] my anatomy's over there
[1135.44 - 1139.64] Madeline says it was intense for me I
[1137.60 - 1142.46] was dizzy nauseated and felt a little
[1139.64 - 1144.86] weak afterward it was only later that I
[1142.46 - 1146.06] got my energy back I feel good though it
[1144.86 - 1147.68] is real
[1146.06 - 1150.08] Thank you Madeline for being here thank
[1147.68 - 1152.12] you for being at the light blast
[1150.08 - 1154.10] truly I'm so glad you were able to get
[1152.12 - 1158.02] in
[1154.10 - 1160.34] I feel sad about people that people that
[1158.02 - 1163.70] registered and and they say they
[1160.34 - 1167.24] couldn't get in I'm 110 000 people there
[1163.70 - 1169.22] the system was was barely hanging in
[1167.24 - 1171.38] there by a thread because it wasn't
[1169.22 - 1173.60] designed for a hundred and ten thousand
[1171.38 - 1176.44] people
[1173.60 - 1176.44] dear Lord
[1176.96 - 1182.00] Patricia Santana over there on YouTube I
[1180.14 - 1185.24] felt the light blast especially in my
[1182.00 - 1187.10] legs I have a peaceful feeling let's see
[1185.24 - 1188.84] how we sleep tonight too some of us
[1187.10 - 1191.60] might sleep a lot better some of us
[1188.84 - 1193.46] might just be buzzing because of the
[1191.60 - 1194.78] amount of healing that occurred it's
[1193.46 - 1196.52] almost like you don't know what to do
[1194.78 - 1199.40] with yourself when you get that much
[1196.52 - 1201.86] healing emotionally Cynthia C says is it
[1199.40 - 1203.78] normal that we feel tired afterwards yes
[1201.86 - 1206.00] yes
[1203.78 - 1207.56] for a bunch of people that's definitely
[1206.00 - 1210.88] gonna happen
[1207.56 - 1210.88] doing some garlic here
[1211.63 - 1213.86] [Music]
[1212.72 - 1215.54] guys remember what it was I always say
[1213.86 - 1217.34] about garlic when you see me crush it by
[1215.54 - 1219.20] hand like that or you see a chef out
[1217.34 - 1220.88] there crush it by hand like that
[1219.20 - 1222.56] you have to have the blade facing out
[1220.88 - 1225.14] you can't have a blade facing in When
[1222.56 - 1227.24] you crush garlic like that
[1225.14 - 1229.16] burning around town says there was less
[1227.24 - 1233.18] Tech issues than last time though laugh

[1293.72 - 1296.90] hmm
[1294.98 - 1298.70] what a smell garlic has isn't it
[1296.90 - 1302.24] something else
[1298.70 - 1304.82] I Saw The Light Deanna says
[1302.24 - 1306.68] incredible I get tingles
[1304.82 - 1308.78] I get goosebumps
[1306.68 - 1311.72] I had chills
[1308.78 - 1313.90] when I just read that just now I Saw the
[1311.72 - 1313.90] Light
[1314.54 - 1321.14] we stuffed the stuff down we stuff it
[1316.94 - 1324.44] deep inside hello I'm living my life oh
[1321.14 - 1327.08] you just betrayed me crap I'm hurting
[1324.44 - 1329.18] for a few weeks or months but I have to
[1327.08 - 1331.10] move forward with my life so I'll pick
[1329.18 - 1333.14] up my feet and I'll keep on moving
[1331.10 - 1335.84] forward and I'm gonna have to stuff that
[1333.14 - 1337.88] betrayal injury down deep inside walking
[1335.84 - 1339.92] around and going on meet somebody else
[1337.88 - 1342.98] or something happens hello how are you
[1339.92 - 1345.98] oh you just broke my trust what the heck
[1342.98 - 1347.84] it hurts hurts really bad but I have to
[1345.98 - 1351.02] move forward I'm going to stuff it down
[1347.84 - 1352.82] deep inside let me bury it down hello I
[1351.02 - 1355.34] keep on moving on with my life I come
[1352.82 - 1358.22] across something else like what why did
[1355.34 - 1360.44] that happen hey that's unfair I'm not
[1358.22 - 1362.66] validated you misunderstood me I stuff
[1360.44 - 1365.14] it down deep inside because you got to
[1362.66 - 1365.14] move forward
[1366.14 - 1370.04] and then it sits there and it sits there
[1368.12 - 1373.10] and it percolates and it percolates and
[1370.04 - 1377.60] it grows and it turns it and it festers
[1373.10 - 1380.42] and festers over time and then
[1377.60 - 1381.98] we're running around doing self-help
[1380.42 - 1384.08] I'm trying this I'm trying that I'm
[1381.98 - 1385.58] trying that I'm trying this but it keeps
[1384.08 - 1387.26] on coming back the patterns keep on
[1385.58 - 1388.82] coming back I try to do this I do this
[1387.26 - 1390.26] meditation I go here I go to yoga class
[1388.82 - 1392.66] I go wherever I'm doing well that's
[1390.26 - 1395.12] great but it still comes back I still
[1392.66 - 1398.60] have all the patterns coming back
[1395.12 - 1400.40] and so what I love about the light blast
[1398.60 - 1402.80] is it's different than anything else
[1400.40 - 1405.44] because it's not man-made down here it's
[1402.80 - 1408.80] not controlled by man it's not
[1405.44 - 1411.08] controlled by time or space it's not
[1408.80 - 1414.04] controlled by law it's not controlled by
[1411.08 - 1417.80] Nature it's not controlled by physics
[1414.04 - 1419.48] nature can be cruel nature can control
[1417.80 - 1422.74] stuff
[1419.48 - 1424.64] physics nature
[1422.74 - 1426.98] controls things
[1424.64 - 1429.14] we need light that's on the Angelic
[1426.98 - 1433.66] realm there's no control
[1429.14 - 1433.66] there's no earthly control
[1436.22 - 1440.60] and what the light blast is it's not
[1438.86 - 1443.24] about that the light blast is separate
[1440.60 - 1447.44] from that it's out of the Earthly chaos
[1443.24 - 1450.32] it's not involved with the Earthly chaos
[1447.44 - 1452.78] that's entirely different
[1450.32 - 1454.58] and so we need that kind of light when
[1452.78 - 1456.44] we're all built up inside with
[1454.58 - 1458.54] everything stuffed down in us to hurt
[1456.44 - 1460.70] the Betrayal the broken trust all the
[1458.54 - 1462.62] pain and suffering all the losses the
[1460.70 - 1464.72] heartache all the different things we go
[1462.62 - 1467.18] through the validation issues because
[1464.72 - 1469.64] we've been not validated because we've
[1467.18 - 1472.46] had trust broken because we're we're
[1469.64 - 1474.50] taking advantage of or we're mistreated
[1472.46 - 1476.66] or we're Gaslight or whatever you want
[1474.50 - 1479.30] to call it there's so much hurt and then
[1476.66 - 1480.92] we need a light that's not controlled by
[1479.30 - 1484.34] law
[1480.92 - 1486.68] govern here on planet mess we need a
[1484.34 - 1489.32] light that's away from that comes from
[1486.68 - 1490.82] above and you believe in God if you
[1489.32 - 1492.50] believe in God that's where the light
[1490.82 - 1494.66] comes from way up there if you believe
[1492.50 - 1496.16] in the universe then it comes from there
[1494.66 - 1497.96] if you believe in a Creator if you
[1496.16 - 1500.90] believe in everybody has different
[1497.96 - 1503.84] beliefs but the light is there
[1500.90 - 1505.94] Alicia M this was my second light blast
[1503.84 - 1508.16] that I felt so clear this second time
[1505.94 - 1510.44] around I didn't feel like getting stuck
[1508.16 - 1513.32] like I did last time which I want to say
[1510.44 - 1515.24] to people once you've had a light blast
[1513.32 - 1518.92] before
[1515.24 - 1518.92] once you've had one
[1519.56 - 1524.48] things can be different when you get
[1522.14 - 1526.70] another light blast
[1524.48 - 1528.38] and that's all incredible all in its own
[1526.70 - 1530.36] things can be so much different when you
[1528.38 - 1533.60] get another late blast
[1530.36 - 1536.54] cold white spring said are you tired
[1533.60 - 1539.20] cold white spring mayor you asking me if
[1536.54 - 1539.20] I'm tired
[1542.42 - 1548.02] the mm who burns a candle at five
[1545.30 - 1548.02] different ends
[1553.46 - 1557.44] okay we're making the healing broth
[1555.08 - 1557.44] right now
[1559.46 - 1561.64] foreign
[1564.86 - 1570.20] yeah I'm tired
[1568.34 - 1570.98] because the light blast is not easy on
[1570.20 - 1574.94] me
[1570.98 - 1577.46] all right but I still
[1574.94 - 1579.86] feel
[1577.46 - 1582.20] a lot of the incredible effects
[1579.86 - 1584.54] what happens is that
[1582.20 - 1586.10] it is tiring on me
[1584.54 - 1589.34] but
[1586.10 - 1592.88] in a good way because I know I'm being
[1589.34 - 1595.52] used as a conduit and that's the that's
[1592.88 - 1597.56] what's tiring
[1595.52 - 1598.46] right because I'm being used as the
[1597.56 - 1601.48] conduit
[1598.46 - 1601.48] the messenger
[1601.58 - 1606.50] facilitated right so because of that
[1604.40 - 1609.32] it's tiring yes
[1606.50 - 1610.46] but I have no complaints
[1609.32 - 1612.44] because
[1610.46 - 1615.02] on the flip side
[1612.44 - 1617.54] I get some light
[1615.02 - 1620.66] which is incredible
[1617.54 - 1623.18] and I feel so good because of it and on
[1620.66 - 1625.34] the flip side the most important
[1623.18 - 1627.38] which isn't about me anymore like the
[1625.34 - 1629.66] most important is you guys getting
[1627.38 - 1631.04] what you need a mattress service I want
[1629.66 - 1633.02] to be at your service and that's the
[1631.04 - 1635.72] critical part is you guys getting what
[1633.02 - 1637.82] you need and that's the part that
[1635.72 - 1640.40] matters to me because I'm at your
[1637.82 - 1642.98] service that's the whole point
[1640.40 - 1645.38] if I have to be the conductor if I have
[1642.98 - 1648.14] to be the conduit and the conductor so
[1645.38 - 1649.88] be it that's fine if it tires me out a
[1648.14 - 1651.14] little bit fine if it targets me out a
[1649.88 - 1652.82] lot fine
[1651.14 - 1654.38] if it puts me in shock for a little bit
[1652.82 - 1656.30] fine
[1654.38 - 1658.64] but it's well worth it when I know you
[1656.30 - 1660.94] guys get what you need and I'm at your
[1658.64 - 1660.94] service
[1662.42 - 1667.76] and then I bounce back after being the
[1665.54 - 1669.98] conduit in the conductor I bounce back
[1667.76 - 1673.22] after being the messenger
[1669.98 - 1675.32] and I feel the effects
[1673.22 - 1677.90] of the light
[1675.32 - 1680.00] this is coming out incredible by the way
[1677.90 - 1682.04] got hot pepper in here I got parsley in
[1680.00 - 1686.62] here I got celery in here I got Tomatoes
[1682.04 - 1686.62] I got carrots and I forgot the onions

[1693.38 - 1698.88] gonna get tears in the eyes
[1695.69 - 1698.88] [Music]
[1699.38 - 1703.52] we don't edit these These are live right
[1702.08 - 1705.50] here I'm live in the moment I just want
[1703.52 - 1709.48] you to know what's happening inside our
[1705.50 - 1709.48] bodies mm sugar plum masks
[1712.34 - 1716.06] hurt
[1713.60 - 1718.04] takes up space
[1716.06 - 1719.84] hurt from betrayal and broken trust in
[1718.04 - 1721.82] Old Wounds going all the way back from
[1719.84 - 1724.10] relationships to just different things
[1721.82 - 1726.62] that have happened in life take up space
[1724.10 - 1729.08] and then we've run around trying to
[1726.62 - 1730.88] actually soothe ourselves and we get in
[1729.08 - 1732.56] trouble we get into addictions we get
[1730.88 - 1734.60] into self-destructive patterns we get
[1732.56 - 1736.82] into everything we jump into self-help
[1734.60 - 1739.64] we look for help we get we do all these
[1736.82 - 1742.52] things we say we see we seek out therapy
[1739.64 - 1744.56] everything we do right psychiatrists
[1742.52 - 1746.90] therapists
[1744.56 - 1751.10] we seek out therapy
[1746.90 - 1754.94] because we're trying to fix it right
[1751.10 - 1757.16] but those wounds take up space
[1754.94 - 1759.68] they take up brain space they take up
[1757.16 - 1762.32] Soul Space they take up
[1759.68 - 1765.08] Spirit heart soul space
[1762.32 - 1767.42] Mind Body however you want to call it it
[1765.08 - 1769.34] takes up space so if you want to ask the
[1767.42 - 1773.54] question what is happening
[1769.34 - 1775.58] in our bodies mm start with
[1773.54 - 1776.72] what the light blast does is it opens up
[1775.58 - 1778.94] new space
[1776.72 - 1781.10] inside of us inside our soul inside of
[1778.94 - 1783.22] our body inside of our spirit inside of
[1781.10 - 1783.22] us
[1783.26 - 1789.98] it it actually
[1786.50 - 1793.88] is extracting that Venom and that poison
[1789.98 - 1795.44] right that old hurt and then when that
[1793.88 - 1797.48] leaves
[1795.44 - 1799.04] you got space
[1797.48 - 1800.42] do you ever have a really cluttered
[1799.04 - 1801.86] house did you ever have a cluttered
[1800.42 - 1803.78] apartment do you ever have a cluttered
[1801.86 - 1807.20] closet because you ever have anything
[1803.78 - 1809.66] that was so cluttered right
[1807.20 - 1812.92] your car is cluttered what about your
[1809.66 - 1812.92] car is your car cluttered
[1813.68 - 1818.00] you ever you ever drive a car that's
[1815.84 - 1819.74] filled with so much stuff there's
[1818.00 - 1820.82] garbage on the floors did you ever do
[1819.74 - 1822.80] that you're like maybe you're somebody
[1820.82 - 1824.30] that never happened to you there there
[1822.80 - 1825.92] isn't a bunch of garbage on the floor
[1824.30 - 1827.54] you don't have boxes you don't have
[1825.92 - 1830.72] stuff I know people they have to live
[1827.54 - 1832.82] out of their cars practically and
[1830.72 - 1835.72] their cars are just taking up there's no
[1832.82 - 1835.72] space in their car
[1836.60 - 1840.56] what happens when you clean that car up
[1838.82 - 1842.06] and you get rid of all that stuff and
[1840.56 - 1843.44] you organize it and you get it out and
[1842.06 - 1845.48] you throw out a lot of bunch of stuff
[1843.44 - 1847.28] whether it's in a house an apartment
[1845.48 - 1849.76] whether it's in a dwelling whether it's
[1847.28 - 1849.76] in a car
[1850.88 - 1858.10] it makes room for something else
[1854.60 - 1858.10] makes room for something else
[1859.28 - 1865.52] when you actually
[1861.50 - 1867.26] are experiencing the removal of wounds
[1865.52 - 1870.32] that shouldn't sit there and fester
[1867.26 - 1873.26] forever year after year of 20 years 30
[1870.32 - 1876.26] years when you remove those
[1873.26 - 1879.22] what happens you guys
[1876.26 - 1879.22] space opens up
[1880.46 - 1886.10] and then things are possible an ignition
[1883.34 - 1888.14] igniting the healing process

[2103.30 - 2107.88] okay so got a comment here
[2108.76 - 2112.12] um the light blast I signed up used a
[2111.34 - 2115.72] link
[2112.12 - 2117.58] I signed up before nine o'clock CST this
[2115.72 - 2119.56] morning and nothing
[2117.58 - 2121.66] I had check telegram for updates and the
[2119.56 - 2123.96] final update was not clear that you were
[2121.66 - 2123.96] starting
[2124.06 - 2128.86] and no indication that it had finished I
[2126.34 - 2131.20] finally logged off after 10 20. this is
[2128.86 - 2133.60] breaking my heart as we as as I'm
[2131.20 - 2136.00] speaking
[2133.60 - 2138.64] this was a waste of my time and you seem
[2136.00 - 2142.42] to have no consideration for others
[2138.64 - 2144.64] look I know you're upset I I really do
[2142.42 - 2146.68] feel bad that something went wrong there
[2144.64 - 2148.66] I appreciate you having this service but
[2146.68 - 2151.00] if you can't consistently deliver you
[2148.66 - 2154.12] need to Pivot and find a new method
[2151.00 - 2156.58] Instagram live allows way more people
[2154.12 - 2158.68] why don't you just go live instead of
[2156.58 - 2160.96] whatever you are using that I didn't get
[2158.68 - 2163.12] to take part in my partner will be
[2160.96 - 2166.18] throwing your books out
[2163.12 - 2168.88] since he is so disappointed this late
[2166.18 - 2171.52] blast was a joke and apparently it's on
[2168.88 - 2174.12] me and everyone else that didn't get to
[2171.52 - 2174.12] join okay
[2174.22 - 2180.10] please I just want to say something all
[2176.74 - 2183.28] right first of all it kills me that
[2180.10 - 2186.22] you're upset and that's your that your
[2183.28 - 2189.16] partner is upset first of all okay and
[2186.22 - 2191.38] here's what happened okay
[2189.16 - 2193.60] it takes a lot of technology to harness
[2191.38 - 2195.64] this what we're doing
[2193.60 - 2197.98] and a hundred and ten thousand people
[2195.64 - 2199.60] got on because people share the link
[2197.98 - 2201.94] and they're not supposed to share the
[2199.60 - 2204.58] link and a lot of people share the link
[2201.94 - 2206.02] and so glitches happen with the
[2204.58 - 2207.94] technology
[2206.02 - 2209.52] right and
[2207.94 - 2212.74] Instagram
[2209.52 - 2214.72] lives they have a cap on me
[2212.74 - 2216.28] and they usually only let me have five
[2214.72 - 2219.40] six seven hundred people when I used to
[2216.28 - 2221.68] have six to ten thousand people
[2219.40 - 2223.42] um per live I used to get six seven
[2221.68 - 2225.22] eight ten thousand people every time I
[2223.42 - 2227.08] went live on Instagram but they they
[2225.22 - 2229.12] tapped me
[2227.08 - 2231.94] and so they did that and they usually
[2229.12 - 2233.62] keep me around six seven hundred or if
[2231.94 - 2236.80] I'm lucky they'll let me have like
[2233.62 - 2239.38] fourteen hundred like out of nowhere one
[2236.80 - 2241.72] day but they won't let anybody else go
[2239.38 - 2244.18] on they get kicked off
[2241.72 - 2248.40] so I can't use IG
[2244.18 - 2248.40] right so I'm just letting you know I'm
[2251.50 - 2255.76] just you know so you understand
[2254.50 - 2257.86] but
[2255.76 - 2259.36] I feel for you I'm sorry if you're gonna
[2257.86 - 2261.46] throw the books out
[2259.36 - 2264.76] and I'm sorry that like you're really
[2261.46 - 2268.80] upset and I and
[2264.76 - 2268.80] if I were you I would be mad too
[2268.90 - 2274.06] and that's how I feel and there are a
[2270.82 - 2275.98] lot of people that couldn't log on and
[2274.06 - 2279.22] something went wrong it was either on
[2275.98 - 2281.50] their system or it was because of of our
[2279.22 - 2283.54] system but people share the link and we
[2281.50 - 2286.84] had 110 000 people on when there was
[2283.54 - 2289.42] only supposed to be 33 000 people and it
[2286.84 - 2293.38] is a free event and I'm not trying to
[2289.42 - 2296.92] cry or anything about stuff but to put
[2293.38 - 2298.72] this event on it costs me thousands and
[2296.92 - 2301.00] thousands of dollars
[2298.72 - 2303.70] and so I don't charge like a hundred
[2301.00 - 2306.40] dollars for a sign up a hundred dollars
[2303.70 - 2308.74] for a ticket for each person
[2306.40 - 2311.02] I don't do that there's no charge
[2308.74 - 2313.36] and it but yet it cost me tens of
[2311.02 - 2315.76] thousands of dollars to actually run and
[2313.36 - 2317.98] and put on and pay my team and we work
[2315.76 - 2319.42] on it for weeks
[2317.98 - 2323.52] um including the Technologies were
[2319.42 - 2323.52] expensive to use for that anyway
[2323.80 - 2330.36] so I just want to be of service so what
[2327.10 - 2330.36] I do is is
[2330.70 - 2335.20] what I like to like what I love to do is
[2333.10 - 2337.36] give to the community
[2335.20 - 2339.16] and not empty their pockets
[2337.36 - 2340.36] that's what I've always done all these
[2339.16 - 2342.82] years
[2340.36 - 2345.40] I'm the only one out there to whatever
[2342.82 - 2347.80] they call it my caliber that's what PR
[2345.40 - 2349.78] people will say my caliber up there in
[2347.80 - 2351.52] the health and healing world
[2349.78 - 2354.58] then I hate hearing that and when they
[2351.52 - 2356.32] say I'm the only one that doesn't do
[2354.58 - 2358.36] subscription fees for the website
[2356.32 - 2360.34] programs and classes and courses and
[2358.36 - 2362.20] certifications all these things that
[2360.34 - 2363.76] just make tons and tons of money to make
[2362.20 - 2367.24] me a billionaire
[2363.76 - 2369.70] also did you turn on the audio button on
[2367.24 - 2372.16] the bottom left if you did not that is
[2369.70 - 2374.80] another reason you have no sound for
[2372.16 - 2377.38] people who didn't have sound so
[2374.80 - 2380.10] onions are there are cooking
[2377.38 - 2380.10] oh
[2382.00 - 2386.80] so anyway
[2384.82 - 2388.36] but I wanted to re I saw that comment

[2413.98 - 2418.24] I get a beating no matter what I do by
[2415.96 - 2421.66] the way you guys I get a beating
[2418.24 - 2423.94] I get whipping I get a beating
[2421.66 - 2426.42] I get the crap beat out of me no matter
[2423.94 - 2426.42] what I do
[2428.68 - 2432.06] and then of course you know
[2432.82 - 2436.98] there are enough hate groups out there
[2434.26 - 2436.98] that don't like me
[2440.02 - 2443.56] I'm grateful too for you guys I just saw
[2441.88 - 2445.92] that you're so grateful I'm grateful for
[2443.56 - 2445.92] you too
[2448.72 - 2452.14] all storms pass coaching I see that
[2451.00 - 2454.54] right there
[2452.14 - 2458.32] over there on YouTube
[2454.54 - 2460.96] I also felt the light stop in my chest
[2458.32 - 2463.72] the first blast with the first blast
[2460.96 - 2466.06] after that one I felt really
[2463.72 - 2468.60] uncomfortable in my body can't explain
[2466.06 - 2468.60] it
[2469.36 - 2474.90] but felt a full release after the last
[2472.24 - 2474.90] blast
[2476.38 - 2480.70] and and you guys remember
[2478.96 - 2483.88] it was like
[2480.70 - 2487.72] the intensity was getting increased
[2483.88 - 2490.48] so SSC would say increasing
[2487.72 - 2492.72] and then I would get kind of like
[2490.48 - 2495.70] they get kind of a little scared right
[2492.72 - 2498.40] because I know that so much is going to
[2495.70 - 2499.54] be flying out of people so much hurt and
[2498.40 - 2502.18] so many things that have been trapped
[2499.54 - 2505.30] there for so long and print it
[2502.18 - 2507.88] like imprinted within us like imprint it
[2505.30 - 2508.96] within us so much gets imprinted and
[2507.88 - 2511.36] trapped
[2508.96 - 2512.98] and so on Spirit of compassion Spirit of
[2511.36 - 2515.50] compassion doesn't start out on the
[2512.98 - 2517.30] first blast is the most powerful
[2515.50 - 2519.34] because
[2517.30 - 2521.62] it's
[2519.34 - 2524.26] graduate
[2521.62 - 2527.62] because it has to be that way
[2524.26 - 2529.72] because there are people with a lot less
[2527.62 - 2531.28] wounds
[2529.72 - 2533.38] but there are a lot of people with so
[2531.28 - 2536.56] much going on that it can't be full
[2533.38 - 2538.42] power on the very first
[2536.56 - 2541.42] blast
[2538.42 - 2543.70] because that's like
[2541.42 - 2547.80] pavement you know like for real it's
[2543.70 - 2547.80] hitting the road real hard
[2552.60 - 2556.54] with the second length glass Janet says
[2555.28 - 2561.66] with the second light blast I had
[2556.54 - 2561.66] tingles in my arms and legs but it was
[2565.18 - 2569.86] Technology's going crazy today but it
[2567.52 - 2572.38] was the release of tears that surprised
[2569.86 - 2575.26] me and I have just woken up from a
[2572.38 - 2577.36] two-hour nap something I never do
[2575.26 - 2578.86] I am feeling mellow and so thankful for
[2577.36 - 2581.02] this opportunity and Janet what's going
[2578.86 - 2584.74] to happen is that's not where it stops
[2581.02 - 2585.88] the healing with the light blast it
[2584.74 - 2589.08] Carries On
[2585.88 - 2589.08] it Carries On

[2914.14 - 2919.54] he was doing an open heart surgery
[2917.32 - 2922.62] and

[2959.50 - 2963.28] he had the light blast during his
[2961.36 - 2965.56] surgery
[2963.28 - 2967.60] and he said he had less alcohol to drink
[2965.56 - 2970.84] after the surgery so he
[2967.60 - 2973.12] he sent down less shots of
[2970.84 - 2975.52] of vodka
