9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,199

but when you hear what I have to say you

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,200
might take some consideration you might

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,960
think about it and it might play a role

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,840
in your health one way or another

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,200
whether you think the information is not

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,960
true or eggs can't be bad or I raise my

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,760
own eggs in the backyard and I have a

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,039
chicken shed or I've been getting fresh

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,000
eggs from my neighbor for 20 years and

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,640
nothing ever happened to me so how can

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,800

Millet for the Millet is for the sushi

51
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,440
it takes place of rice in the sushi as

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,480
you can see right here in the Brain saer

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,400

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,480
grandmother's 103 years old and she ate

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,599
eggs her whole life so there's no reason

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,440
why we should be able to eat them I get

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,640
it I know what you guys are thinking but

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,959
we're going to cover it and cover how

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,360
things

66
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,200
work I'm even nervous how about that I'm

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,120
even nervous who would have thought

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,640
right out of all the things I'm just

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,760
going to mix this Mill it in here a

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,319
little bit then I'm going to get a lid

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,879
on it I want it to simmer and I want to

72
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,519
keep a very small mild simmering going

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,519
on once it hits a

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,840
boil so I've been making Millet for

75
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,760
years more than three decades I like

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,360
Millet for a lot of just a lot of

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,959
different recipes it's grain I realize

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,000
that a lot of people they don't want a

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,360
grain in their diet I completely

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,040
understand but like medical medium

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,120
information goes you can go as far as

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
you

83
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,799
want far as you want you can be

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,879
grainfree

85
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,599
you can be on meat you can be on

86
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,640
something else but you you can use

87
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,519
whatever cauliflower rice the point is

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,200
medical meme information is about going

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,799
as far as you need to go when you want

90
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,040
to and when you're ready but also

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,159
certain ingredients like Millet when we

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
can use it if we would like to and so

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,480
forth I feel it's one of the best grains

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,720
from the information I've received from

95
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,840
my source if you're going to ever have a

96
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,519
grain or you can just do cauliflour Rice

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,680
as well that's an option too and I've

98
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,799
done that many times you guys are coming

99
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,519
on here we're getting ready for why eggs

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,079
are bad for you so you got to get ready

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,400
but I just want to get this Millet to a

102
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,680

something really quick

okay something that's very

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,120
interesting living hungry viruses did

140
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,840
you know viruses eat did you know all

141
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,120
viruses eat did you know viruses have to

142
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,600
eat in order to stay alive do you know

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,720
that when viruses eat they get strong

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,319
did you know they can

145
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,520
multiply you don't believe in viruses no

146
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
h you know when someone has Simplex

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,039
herpes one it's on their lip it's the

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,520
fever blister it's the cold

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,800
sore right you go and you kiss somebody

150
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,560
else or share a glass with somebody and

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,520
you have that fresh fever blister some

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,319
people's fever blisters gets pretty

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,280
gnarly that fever blister can spread to

154
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
the other person and then a couple of

155
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,840
months later or 3 days later depending

156
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,599
on the variety of the simplex one or 2

157
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,280
years later depending on the variety of

158
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,680
simplex one in the person's immune

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,840
system they will break out with a fever

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,840
blister and they will have their first

161
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:51,360
cold sore because there are viruses they

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,319
do exist I want people to heed that

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,319
understanding and actually realize that

164
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,120
when you hear out there viruses don't

165
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,599
exist it's all just parasites viruses

166
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,639
and bacteria don't exist it's all all

167
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,240
just parasites want people to understand

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,919
it's actually the opposite in the sense

169
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,639
where viruses exist hardcore baby it's

170
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,319
hardcore they're out there yes you guys

171
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,080
probably know that by now before the

172
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,240
whole sea thing that happened 3 years

173
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,599
ago before before that whole thing that

174
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,960
occurred right you know the crazy flu

175
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,160
stuff before it all occurred there were

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
a lot of people in health that didn't

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
even believe viruses even existed

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,360
anywhere and then that whole thing

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,520
happened in 2020

180
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,960
and then boom now even people in the

181
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,759
health realm and Alternative Health

182
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,120
believe that viruses do exist now

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,960
there's still a lot of people that don't

184
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,759
but they do just like you can catch

185
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,560
herpes simplex one just from a glass

186
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
just from bodily fluids just from

187
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,759
kissing someone and they have it too

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,720
just like you can catch that yes they do

189
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,879
exist and they're catchy for the record

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
viruses are

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,520
living in the publicly known Arena of

192
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,560
Science Now I want to just say this this

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,560
real quick publicly known Arena of

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,400
science what does that mean it means

195
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,680
what public publicly known like a doctor

196
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,919
down the road in a practice what he is

197
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,800
allowed to

198
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,159
know publicly known scientists what

199
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,479
they're allowed to know publicly known

200
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,000
medical research and science it's just

201
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,960
whoever is in the arena of Health what

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,680
they're allowed to know just so you know

203
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,039
there's a battle about whether viruses

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,479
are dead or alive viruses are alive and

205
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,320
viruses are hungry hungry hungry hippos

206
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
they

207
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,080
are no one can agree and neither side

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,240
has proven facts here's a pillar of

209
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,760
Truth viruses are alive viruses are

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,839
cells viruses eat now if you're

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,600
wondering where I'm going this is going

212
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,360
to be really interesting

213
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:02,880
here I'm going to a place of viruses eat

214
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,480
now what does that matter what does that

215
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,959
mean and why is he talking about eggs

216
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,120
being bad for us give you a quick window

217
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,680
really quick into it right now you got

218
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,480
an egg right here and you got a virus

219
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,920
right

220
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,800
here you eat the egg the virus eats the

221
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,560
egg you eat the egg the virus inside

222
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,640
your body starts to thrive and eat the

223
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,800
egg you might be somebody that

224
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,800
hey eats eggs for a lot of years I got

225
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,839
nothing wrong with me meanwhile you got

226
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,800
like ra rheumatoid arthritis meanwhile

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,880
you have other things too and you get a

228
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,600
fever blister once every six months

229
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,120
whatever it is what people don't realize

230
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:52,720
is the virus is helping to

231
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:56,560
feed off of the eggs the egg is helping

232
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,640
to feed the virus they work together

233
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,240
that's what it is they become one the

234
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,920
egg helps to feed the virus the virus

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
gets help from the egg and they work

236
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,519
together and they work with each other

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,360
that's how it works so you got to

238
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,720
remember that so when we eat eggs it's

239
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,120
good to know viruses are involved sure

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,279
viruses are not on the egg viruses may

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,560
not be inside the egg but as we eat the

242
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,959
egg viruses inside of us we'll start

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,240
feeding and eating the egg egg that's a

244
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,200
simple explanation in the moment but

245
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,760
we're going deeper we're going to talk

246
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
more about it so let's roll a little bit

247
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,240
for a virus to live long enough inside

248
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,079
the human body to create a chronic

249
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,440
symptom or condition it has to be able

250
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:49,440
to find food and sustain itself viruses

251
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,200
sustain themselves by fi finding

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,240
food by consuming things that it likes

253
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,839
to

254
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,560
eat and eggs are on the top of the

255
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,160
list now

256
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,160
now eggs are fun to eat they taste good

257
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,519
some people swear by them some people

258
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,600
say hey they don't hurt my stomach they

259
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,560
feel good inside of me we're going to

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,720
cover that too in a little while of why

261
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,959
eggs feel good in people's stomachs and

262
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,920
intestinal

263
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,000
tracts and how it doesn't seem like a

264
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,480
problem when someone eats an egg and

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,600
we're going to cover the whole chickens

266
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,680
behind the house on the farm the Chicken

267
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,639
Shack chicken right the p raised eggs

268
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,040
the farm raised eggs the backyard raised

269
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,920
eggs we'll cover that a little bit too a

270
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,680
virus does not have a

271
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,760
mouth it's not an

272
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
animal it's not like a human eating so

273
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,320
even though this little virus right here

274
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,519
has a mouth for fun viruses do not have

275
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,680
mouths they absorb the food through

276
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,160
their membrane that's what they do so

277
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,000
when Foods available it's inside your

278
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,560
liver it's inside your bloodstream it's

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,480
inside your organs

280
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,639
any viruses inside your body inside your

281
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,639
liver bloodstream your organs will find

282
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
that

283
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,399
food so we eat the food we eat the egg

284
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,600
the egg goes down inside of us it's in

285
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,000
our

286
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,920
stomach it's there starts to break apart

287
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,560
our hydrochloric acid starts to break

288
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,519
apart the protein and eggs

289
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,399
protein and with that the egg starts to

290
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,399
break apart and go through the

291
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,839
body just want to let everybody know if

292
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,240
you just got here we're making Millet

293
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,720
Sushi hang out it's going to be fun

294
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,440
we're talking about why eggs are bad for

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,959
you and truly I hope you don't get too

296
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,399
upset and too bummed out if you want to

297
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:57,040
eat eggs you can eat all the eggs you

298
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,120
want that's perfectly fine with me I'm

299
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,800
just saying hey I want to talk about why

300
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,600
maybe it's not a great

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,160
idea and show you in a presentation why

302
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
they're not good for you this is going

303
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,240
to be fun I know that this is a heated

304
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
topic people get charged they get jacked

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,399
up people get the pitchforks out the

306
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,880
Torches the shovels they want to beat my

307
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,160
head in man they want to just take me

308
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,240
out they do not like going like they

309
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,120
don't even like hearing

310
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:33,600
egg if it's going to be something bad

311
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,560
you eat the egg you chew the egg you

312
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,040
swallow the egg the egg gets down into

313
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,680
the

314
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,760
stomach what's left of your hydrochloric

315
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,720
acid because most people have low

316
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,959
HCL what's left of the HCL starts to

317
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,240
work on it and breaks down the proteins

318
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:55,240
of the

319
00:13:49,240 --> 00:14:00,759
egg the fat from the egg by passes the

320
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,759
stomach and ends up in the dadna

321
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,680
your liver has to produce

322
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,839
bile and the bile has to come up and

323
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,440
into the intestinal tract to break down

324
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,880
the fats from the egg a normal

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,720
digestive

326
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,079
process but as this is happening signals

327
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,800
are

328
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,839
occurring and if you have bugs in you

329
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,560
which most likely you do do you have

330
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,279
chronic fatigue syndrome did you have

331
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,320
fatigue do you have brain fog do you

332
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,440
have tingles and numbness aches and

333
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,759
pains do you have ra

334
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,279
fibromyalgia did you have Lyme disease

335
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,959
were you somebody that was diagnosed

336
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,320
with Lyme disease years

337
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,680
ago what kind of symptom condition do

338
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,880
you have do you have

339
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,759
UTI do you get lung infections kidney

340
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,680
infections badder

341
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,880
infections

342
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,199
conjunctivitis

343
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,000
sty what do you have that's going on

344
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,800
what kind of symptom condition do you

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,800
have eczema do you have

346
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,120
psoriasis do you have

347
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,040
Vitiligo what else is happening inside

348
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,160
the body because people have symptoms

349
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,160
and

350
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,639
conditions much of which is caused by

351
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,279
pathogens which are

352
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:30,600
bugs and those bugs start seeking and

353
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,600
searching for particles of eggs

354
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:37,000
for instance strep a bacteria everybody

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,240
has many people have multiple varieties

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,560
of strep inside their intestinal

357
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,399
tract many people have multiple

358
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,759
varieties of strep inside their

359
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,920
lymphatic

360
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,880
vessels they have them in their ears and

361
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,199
around the inside of their ears they

362
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:59,600
have strep varieties on their

363
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,120
anus many people have strep sitting

364
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,079
on their

365
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,079
anus and when they go to the bathroom

366
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,240
strep pops off their anus and ends up in

367
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,680
the

368
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,160
toilet and sits there why more strep is

369
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,680
produced inside their

370
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,399
colon people are loaded with strep they

371
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,120
get the diverticulosis

372
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
diverticulitis they get different

373
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,160
problems in their intestinal tract they

374
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,480
get

375
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,920
IBS whatever kind of bugs you have those

376
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,199
bugs enjoy an

377
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,600
egg they enjoy

378
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:42,120
eggs something important to

379
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
know now we have these comforting

380
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,440
feelings around eggs I understand

381
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,160
completely we find them the ultimate

382
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,959
comfort food indeed we do we find them

383
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,880
the ultimate comfort

384
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,079
food so it's really hard to let go of

385
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,240
our eggs

386
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,600
because hey maybe your grandpa when you

387
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,120
were a kid made you eggs it was really

388
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,679
healing and really soothing maybe your

389
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,799
mom packed you up an egg salad sandwich

390
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,880
when you went to school elementary

391
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,360
school maybe Sunday brunches with family

392
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,679
there were different kinds of eggs

393
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,439
scrambled poach

394
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,400
omelets maybe have a loved one that made

395
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,240
you eggs every day of your life

396
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,000
maybe you remember as a kid just walk

397
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,840
into the chicken shed the coupe the

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,880
chicken Coupe and you harvested fresh

399
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,559
eggs yourself and it was just it's

400
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,960
ingrained in you and it's a beautiful

401
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,280
experience and you harvested your own

402
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,520
eggs for years and your family had them

403
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't doubt any of that isn't good and

404
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't doubt that any of that isn't

405
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,640
special or

406
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,440
beautiful that's not the problem the

407
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,080
world has changed

408
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
which leads to this next thing I want to

409
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,400
talk

410
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,320
about eggs would be fine and dandy they

411
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,679
would be fine and

412
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,480
dandy if what happened by the medical

413
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,960
industry didn't

414
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,600
happen don't blame me for being the

415
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,919
messenger and bringing you the

416
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,280
information about eggs about why they

417
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,840
are bad for you blame the industries the

418
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,760
medical industry yes that's why eggs are

419
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,440
bad for you

420
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,080
and I know that you're thinking hey look

421
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,039
okay I'm listening I'm

422
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,000
listening but it's not enough I want to

423
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,400
know how it works why people get sick

424
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,520
how come they can eat an egg and we'll

425
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,159
go into that as well so but let's hit

426
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
the medical industry first of all

427
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,799
classified medical industry let's start

428
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,440
with that for a little

429
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,159
bit back over 100 years ago they were

430
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,720
playing with their food they were trying

431
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,200
to feed virus uses and pathogens and

432
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,000
keep them alive in the

433
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,360
labs and what they found classified

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,840
medical research in science was that if

435
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
they cut open the top of the

436
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,280
egg and they

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,280
Place

438
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
pathogens

439
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:30,559
bacteria

440
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:33,640
viruses inside the egg they would would

441
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,200
duplicate they would Mass

442
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,120
produce inside the

443
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,000
egg now when they took those viruses and

444
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,840
those pathogens and that

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,840
bacteria and they put it

446
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,200
beside some bacon

447
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,559
pork it didn't Mass produce like

448
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,520
that so over a hundred years ago they

449
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,080
took bacteria and viruses in the lab and

450
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,600
they put it beside pork they put it

451
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:13,000
beside meat beef they put it beside

452
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:17,640
different vegetables and they

453
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,960
noticed that none of the pathogens would

454
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Thrive they wouldn't explode they

455
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,640
wouldn't duplicate

456
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,840
multiply but what they did notice is

457
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,000
when they took took the

458
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,280
egg and just the outside of the egg and

459
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,360
they put pathogens on the outside of the

460
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,080
eggshell they noticed the pathogens

461
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,880
would stay

462
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,000
alive

463
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
interesting and then when they cut the

464
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,120
egg open and they cut the top of the egg

465
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,480
open and they had it in their little

466
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,480
dish

467
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,480
thing they notice when they cut the tops

468
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,840
of the eggs and they put pathogens

469
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,799
within it back bacteria they already

470
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,159
identified they noticed that an

471
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,799
explosion

472
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,840
occurred for some

473
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,799
reason pathogens viruses

474
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
bacteria

475
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,400
mold

476
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,760
yeast

477
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,559
fungus grew

478
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,559
rapidly and exploded inside those

479
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,200
eggs and they knew they can use the eggs

480
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:33,240
as a tool now this is over 100 years

481
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,480
ago keep that in mind this is over a 100

482
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,480
years

483
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,559
ago but classified medical research and

484
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,440
science learned that they can manipulate

485
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:49,559
bugs sound

486
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,960
familiar sound familiar doesn't

487
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:56,039
it because bugs have been raised in labs

488
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,200
for well over a 100 years and that very

489
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,919
bug on your lip when you get the simp

490
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Lex one was raised in a lab

491
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:07,960
originally and it was fed

492
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,360
eggs so that cold sore that you

493
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,279
developed a long time ago in your life

494
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,840
or just developed yesterday because you

495
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,880
picked up the cold sore the fever

496
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,600
blister from somebody else the simplex

497
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:26,720
one that bug is an old bug been around a

498
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:30,600
long time was raised in Labs off of

499
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,880
eggs very important to know let's take

500
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,120
it a little

501
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,360
further every single bug was raised on

502
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,039
eggs at one point early varieties of

503
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,000
Epstein bar virus were raised on eggs in

504
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,279
Labs Epstein bar anybody fibromyalgia

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,880
thyroid thyroiditis

506
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:53,240
Hashimoto

507
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,960
hypothyroidism ra psoriatic

508
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:00,559
arthritis lime disease yeah lime

509
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:05,520
disease ring a bell anybody the Epstein

510
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:09,520
bar virus long C long

511
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,600
Co the epin bar virus was raised early

512
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,880
on by medical research and Science in

513
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,880
Labs knowing knowing that the eggs was

514
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,200
an amazing fuel source for those

515
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,440
pathogens and those pathogens fed and

516
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,559
fed and fed on that egg material why now

517
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,320
let's go to that point real quick how

518
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:36,480
come viruses and bacteria and pathogens

519
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,720
thrive on egg how is it possible because

520
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,360
it's an underdeveloped

521
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,159
protein the egg has an

522
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,480
underdeveloped

523
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:51,919
protein a protein that's not fully

524
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,559
developed it's easy to conquer easy to

525
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,240
feed off

526
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,320
of pathogens and viruses devoured the

527
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
underdeveloped velop protein inside of

528
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,400
raw

529
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,679
eggs the baby chick never had a chance

530
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
never had a

531
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,279
chance for

532
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,039
survival not that it would have survived

533
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
the eggs were already cracked open and

534
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,799
used in the lab

535
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,679
anyway the chicken would have never made

536
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,320
it no matter

537
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,279
what but the underdeveloped proteins

538
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,279
that that baby chick had was a fuel

539
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,720
source for viruses to easily conquer and

540
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,320
invade

541
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
it was a quick fuel source whether

542
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,200
anybody likes it or

543
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,960
not what whether anybody likes it or not

544
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,480
I don't believe him that can't be true

545
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,120
he's evil what does he know he's not a

546
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,399
doctor I eat eggs every day and feed

547
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,320
them to my kids eggs are good staple for

548
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,480
me I got strong fingernails and I got

549
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,039
good skin my grandmother ate eggs for

550
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,480
150 years she never had a single problem

551
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:06,080
I get it everybody's going to be

552
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,480
freaking the Freak Out totally and they

553
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,480
do and they do I'm an athlete and I eat

554
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,200
eight eggs a day this is

555
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,080
BS go listen to blah blah blah this link

556
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,000
right here this guy will tell you how

557
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,840
good eggs are heard it all seen it all

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,159
it doesn't change one powerful fact the

559
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,600
industry used eggs to create more

560
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,039
viruses and

561
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,880
pathogens those were released in our

562
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,200
environment through certain

563
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,159
means and

564
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,520
exposures and those viruses have thrived

565
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,799
and that's why nursing homes have 30

566
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:53,440
year olds in them and that's why nursing

567
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:57,080
homes are loaded with 30y

568
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,559
olds uh-huh who can't use their arms and

569
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,520
legs any anymore who are literally

570
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:07,480
trapped in bed neurologically sick being

571
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,760
spoonfed IVs food being drawn up through

572
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,200
their stomach through a j

573
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,120
tube because of pathogens from

574
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
classified medical research and science

575
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,520
going all the way back over a hundred

576
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,039
years ago but eggs make me feel good but

577
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,240
eggs go really easy in my stomach he's

578
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,600

580
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
protein

581
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,520
but the viruses and the pathogens the

582
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,799
bacteria that are here and the super

583
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:44,640
fungus the super

584
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:49,320

sure it's not the people in the

596
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,200
hospital's fault it's nothing like that

597
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,279
it's just a hardcore truth whether

598
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,320
anybody likes it or not

599
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,039
and guess what my feelings don't get

600
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,840
hurt when people talk crap about the

601
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,360
medical medium egg information that's

602
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,760
out

603
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,760
there I just always have this gleam of

604
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,159
hope that somebody who's really sick and

605
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,640
suffering and struggling who's eating

606
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,919
eggs in that moment might be able to

607
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,200
switch gears not eat eggs and get a

608
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,000
fighting chance so at least the

609
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,840
pathogens are keep that are keeping them

610
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,519
bedridden are not feeding on something

611
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,519
that in the end will keep them bogged

612
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
down

613
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,240
lot to talk about we're still going man

614
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,080
wild blueberry dreams on IG says a w my

615
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,880
functional medicine doctor had me

616
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,039
reintroduce eggs back into my diet and

617
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,559
soon after ended up in the hospital

618
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,960
diagnosed with multiple sorosis multiple

619
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,640
sclerosis I wrote in the medical medium

620
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,519
books from above Ms caused by Epstein

621
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,159
bar virus and lo and

622
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,080
behold Harvard took that information

623
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,039
from the books because guess what it was

624
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,919
published here first that Epstein bar is

625
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
the cause of multiple

626
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,200

670
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,159
environment okay so if I'm laying in bed

671
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,960

687
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
deeper

00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,799
omelette I don't care if it's eggs

693
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:57,760
benedict I don't care if it's just in

694
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:59,760
your Mayo which is kind of funny because

695
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,440
how come we're told not to leave the

696
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,519
mayonnaise out in the sun because you

697
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,919
can

698
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,919
die how about

699
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,760
that how

700
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:19,480
about why would we

701
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,720
die if you leave that tuna salad

702
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,720
sandwich that tuna fish sandwich that

703
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,279
has mayo

704
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,679
outside too long you got to keep it

705
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,440
refrigerated

706
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,480
or you can

707
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,919
die are we allowed to leave egg salad in

708
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,799
the Sun how come we can't leave egg

709
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,080
salad in the sun all day because chances

710
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,360
are someone's going to say dear lord

711
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,720
lord throw that egg salad out you're

712
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,720
going to

713
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,880
die yeah interesting because I'm still

714
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
trying I'm like scratching my head and

715
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm thinking how come how come if you

716
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,760
leave some cucumber salad in the outside

717
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,320
on the table and in the sun you're not

718
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,639
going to

719
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,240
die how about if you leave something

720
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,559
else out there too whatever some fruit

721
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,000
you're not going to die how

722
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:16,360
come you can even you can even leave a

723
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,440
steak sandwich out there you can leave a

724
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:23,200
freaking steak sandwich out there on the

725
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,880
table at a picnic for hours come to it

726
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,799
and be like whoo this is a good steak

727
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,960
sandwich I'm just going to eat this now

728
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,200
but the minute you leave an egg salad

729
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,000
out there on the table and you went out

730
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,279
there playing frisbee for a couple of

731
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,200
hours and that egg salad sitting on the

732
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,399
table someone's going to say oh my God

733
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,720
don't eat that smack it out of your hand

734
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,279
slam you in the face while you spit out

735
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,519
that egg salad and they're going to say

736
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,279
what do you want to

737
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,679
die how

738
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,240
come because

739
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:00,799
eggs can explode with bacteria and

740
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,000
pathogens that's why because too many

741
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,080
people have gotten sick from eggs

742
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,520
sitting out too long or at a picnic or a

743
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,520
mayonnaise they've gotten sick food

744
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,839
poisoning W how is that possible is it

745
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
okay what about an orange sitting out on

746
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,879
the table half the day are you going to

747
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
die if your orange is sitting on the

748
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,280
picnic table for half the day are you

749
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,800
going to die then you can go up there

750
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,040
and eat that orange right but how is it

751
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,599
possible you leave that egg salad out

752
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,119
there too long or how about this potato

753
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,280
salad with the mayonnaise you leave that

754
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,800
out there too

755
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,159
long you're playing Russian roulette

756
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,000
man crazy next thing you know you're

757
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,000
barfing your brains out you're [ __ ]

758
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,679
your brains out you're in the hospital

759
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,919
you're on IVs you're totally your system

760
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,839
is crashed your your immune systems

761
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:57,520
crashed your adrenals are crashed

762
00:34:52,839 --> 00:35:02,160
because that Mayo that egg can PL riate

763
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:05,160
man it can explode in bugs because bugs

764
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,640
feed off of eggs I'm sorry to tell you

765
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,040
but it's more than that bugs inside of

766
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,040
our body feed on the eggs we

767
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,720
eat important to

768
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,400
know I'm going to check my

769
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,320
Millet want to give him a little Quick

770
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Check

771
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,079
nice want to make sure it's good I think

772
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,079
it

773
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:49,680
is let's

774
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,599
go excuse me I hope you're okay with

775
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,480
this hold

776
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,160
on don't want to burn my mouth it's done

777
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:09,319
it's cooked I just would like to taste

778
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,319
it m so good

779
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,560
perfect

780
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,560
wow all right c a little bit

781
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,599
more yep guys we're going to make Millet

782
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,240
sushi in a couple minutes just want to

783
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,240
give you a little bit more insight on

784
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,599
eggs you eat the egg the egg ends up in

785
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,240
the stomach if you're somebody with acid

786
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,119
reflux and you got bacteria creating

787
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,599
that acid reflux if you're somebody with

788
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,599
ulcers and you got bacteria creating

789
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,040
those ulcers guess what the bacteria is

790
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,079
going to feed off of it's going to feed

791
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,079
off of egg particles underdeveloped

792
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,440
proteins the minute that egg drops drops

793
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,200
down into your intestinal tra and you're

794
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,960
dealing with crohn's colitis

795
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,760
IBS any kind of inflammation in your

796
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,680
intestinal tract corners of your colon

797
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,760
corners of your small intestinal tract

798
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,560
ilium anything you got in there bacteria

799
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,160
strep staff

800
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,640
SEI it's going to have a bonanza it's

801
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,800
going to be eating off the

802
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,599
underdeveloped egg proteins it's going

803
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,599
to feed off of it I hate to bring this

804
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,599
news

805
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,520
once that egg gets down and it's now

806
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,160
down there to the alium it comes back up

807
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,359
it's it's asending then it's going

808
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,240
across then it's descending and we got a

809
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,040
whole bunch of different kinds of strep

810
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,359
and other things in this bacteria yeast

811
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,359
bad yeast fungus that's not the good

812
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:51,720
fungus all of it mold whatever we got in

813
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,240
US guess what it's going to thrive and

814
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,280
it's going to be happy and it's going to

815
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,400
feed off those particles but more than

816
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,520
that when that that egg is sitting

817
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,520
inside the intestinal

818
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,480
tract it's going to start going through

819
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,079
the intestinal tract lining as it's

820
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,839
being broken down and digested and

821
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,240
particles of that egg is going to ride

822
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,640
up into the liver up the hepatic portal

823
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,280
Highway when it gets to the

824
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,160
liver people have a lot of sick livers

825
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,520
they're loaded with things that create

826
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,240
things like hepatitis C which is Epstein

827
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,760
bar

828
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,839
they have all kinds of pathogens and

829
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,280
bugs inside their

830
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,000
liver it's going to feed off of the egg

831
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,400
inside the liver people walking around

832
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,319
with sick livers I couldn't believe it I

833
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,319
saw an ad the other day an ad out there

834
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,000
on

835
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:48,880
social of some [ __ ]

836
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,720
drinking and I say this with

837
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,200
respect some [ __ ] doctor or somebody

838
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,000
out of respect was drinking a whole big

839
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,960
thing of olive oil telling people this

840
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,960
is really good for

841
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,960
you a ni nice way to kill your liver

842
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,640
just kill your liver drink let's just

843
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,240
drink a whole thing of olive oil why am

844
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,480
I saying this

845
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,760
because those same practitioners and

846
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,800
doctors believe in eggs they believe in

847
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,960
them like nobody's business they believe

848
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
eggs are good they're filled with

849
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,480
nutrients I get it there's nutrients in

850
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,079
eggs there's some minerals and eggs of

851
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,319
course because the baby chick needed

852
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,240
those

853
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:37,160
minerals there's protein and eggs under

854
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,960
under develop proteins but they're there

855
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,119
there's amino acids and eggs of course

856
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,760
the baby chicken needed those amino

857
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,280
acids there's a lot of different

858
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,640
nutrients inside the eggs too to provide

859
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,760
that baby chick steam to actually

860
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,000
develop and

861
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,599
grow and I think a lot of people are

862
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,440
hanging their hat on that my eggs have

863
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,440
you know a mega 3es in them our eggs at

864
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,640
our farm have lots of Omega-3s in them

865
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:11,240
our farm fresh eggs are loaded with

866
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,240
Omega-3s and many

867
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,640
nutrients that doesn't determine what's

868
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,079
going to happen with bugs inside of us

869
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,040
that are keeping us sick it's not going

870
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,880
to

871
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,880
determine what bugs in us do just

872
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,960
because there is a little bit of Omega-3

873
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,599
in somebody's farm fresh eggs doesn't

874
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,359
mean that's going to protect you for

875
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,319
when the pathogens viruses yeast and

876
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,640
mold have a Feeding Frenzy on particles

877
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:38,640
of egg that it wants there ain't no

878
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,079
omega-3 that's going to stop that and

879
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,440
there ain't no mineral and there ain't

880
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,040
no Trace mineral and there ain't no

881
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,560
nutrient or amino acid throwing nothing

882
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,480
like that inside that egg that's going

883
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,760
to stop that pathogen from eating and

884
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,359
eating and here's the other thing you

885
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,520
can be healthy seemingly healthy and you

886
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,960
can have eggs every single day you can

887
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,200
be eating them and lo and behold you

888
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,960
finally get sick because guess what one

889
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,960
egg too much pushed you over the edge

890
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,680
your immune system was low Death By A

891
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,880
Thousand Cuts you already had other

892
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,960
exposures and problems maybe you picked

893
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,680
up a new bug in a relationship or

894
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,880
something and finally that omelette

895
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,400
you're eating or that poached egg or

896
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,640
that fried egg or over easy or sunny

897
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,319
side up got to you finally because it

898
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,640
fed the pathogens and maybe that

899
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,000
UTI that you got that you had to take

900
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,880
antibiotics for wouldn't have happened

901
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,599
if eggs weren't in your system all these

902
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,400
years and you weren't eating eggs on a

903
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,960
regular basis you would have been

904
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,079
protected from that UTI because those

905
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,280
eggs just push things over the edge just

906
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,440
enough for pathogens and bacteria to

907
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:47,520
feed on those eggs and then double in in

908
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,480
amounts per ounce of

909
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,359
blood when we eat the egg goes into our

910
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,040
liver it goes up the hepatic portal vein

911
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,480
it goes into our bloodstream and if

912
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,240
you're you're dealing with infections

913
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,240
all through your body like trigeminal

914
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,760
neuralgia because you got simplex one or

915
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,599
the shingles you dealing with the

916
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,160
shingles and the shingles is giving you

917
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:10,240
all this jaw pain all this ear pain and

918
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,079
facial pain and your nerves are inflamed

919
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,560
your vagus nerves are inflamed all

920
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,800
through your body and you're

921
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,280
struggling and you're panicking and you

922
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,760
got problems with your nervous system

923
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,079
eggs will help and feed the problem they

924
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,800
won't help fix the problem they help

925
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,760
worsen the problem now I don't tell

926
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,440
people never eat an egg if you don't

927
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,319
want an egg I tell them if you're sick

928
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,040
and you're struggling it would be a good

929
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,599
idea if you refrain from eggs and keep

930
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,839
them back and not have them in your life

931
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,960
because they're

932
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,200
trouble because they feed the bugs all

933
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,680
right you guys I'm going to make some

934
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,680
Millet

935
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,280
Sushi let's roll let's have some

936
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,280
fun and on a note okay I know the

937
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,040
emotional attachment to eggs I know the

938
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,599
Comfort the comfort food I know that

939
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,680
some people say it's the one thing that

940
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,640
doesn't bother my stomach because if I

941
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,800
eat a raw vegetable my intestinal track

942
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,640
if I eat a lettuce my intestinal tra

943
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,800
hurts and doesn't feel good I know

944
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,599
there's a whole bunch of people and they

945
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,160
say when they eat an egg it feels good

946
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,839
let me tell you why real quick before we

947
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,359
get

948
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:23,400
rolling when you have eggs they don't

949
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,079
rub against your intestinal lining when

950
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,800
you eat an

951
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,920
egg they don't massage your intestinal

952
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,000
lining this is so important to know

953
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,720
probably one of the most important

954
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,240
things to know because I know so many

955
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,800
people are going to be like no eggs make

956
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,480
my stomach feel

957
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,119
good but what you have to

958
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:48,240
know is that the eggs turn into a

959
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:52,319
liquefied glue that doesn't massage or

960
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,960
create peristaltic action it doesn't rub

961
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,000
your Linings when you eat a piece of

962
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,240
lettuce it must massages the Linings as

963
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,400
it's going through you when you eat a

964
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,359
little piece of red cabbage when you eat

965
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,440
some

966
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:13,319
Millet when you eat a piece of fruit an

967
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,440
orange it's going to massage it's going

968
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,200
to go through your intestinal tract and

969
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,920
you might be one of those people where

970
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,160
you've got hot spots inside your

971
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,839
intestinal tract pockets of inflammation

972
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,800
because of pathogens bacteria likee

973
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,480
strep and different viruses and those

974
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,559
Pockets that have the strep and the

975
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,599
different viruses and yeast and mold and

976
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,480
fungus that's not the good fungus when

977
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,559
you have pockets of this you get

978
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,640
inflammation in the pockets expansions

979
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,680
and narrowings your small intestinal

980
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,000
tract will expand in areas and it'll

981
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,079
also narrow and tighten up and lose its

982
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,920
elasticity in areas and

983
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,640
then you eat something like a vegetable

984
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,520
you eat a steamed vegetable you eat a

985
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,079
raw vegetable you eat a piece of lettuce

986
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,319
you eat it orange you eat a piece of

987
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,400
fruit you eat a cucumber and you're like

988
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:03,839
I'm not digesting this food good I can't

989
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,359
eat salads I can't digest good but what

990
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,680
you don't know is it's digesting it's

991
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,119
just that you're feeling it rub and

992
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,319
you're feeling it roll and when it rubs

993
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,280
and rolls you got hot spots you're going

994
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,160
to be like I better go back to eating

995
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,480
eggs because those eggs felt good and

996
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,520
the reason why they may feel good is

997
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,200
because they become a glue they become a

998
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,440
liquefied goop and that liquefied goop

999
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,880
doesn't rub it doesn't touch the

1000
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,640
intestinal lining too much it goes

1001
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,920
through and it sits there like a goo and

1002
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,040
it's not creating peristaltic action

1003
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,800
it's not going into corners and cleaning

1004
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,640
them out instead it's feeding what's

1005
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,280
ever there to begin with that's giving

1006
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,079
you the sensations of I got problems

1007
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,440
with my intestinal tract and guts to

1008
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,359
begin with and that's why people find

1009
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,880
eggs soothing they find them easy on the

1010
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:01,640
system they find that they're not

1011
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,160
creating a problem in the moment they

1012
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,839
could eat the eggs they feel soft

1013
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,119
they're cuddly they feel like a warm

1014
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:10,920
comfortable blanket and that's how it

1015
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,960
feels inside of

1016
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,880
us and we get tricked and we think we're

1017
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,880
good and we're

1018
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,240
fine all

1019
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,000
right now I'm hoping to actually

1020
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,760
replicate this right here but if you've

1021
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,599
ever been to Medical medum lives and

1022
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,480
recipes and stuff like that occasionally

1023
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,119
it just goes a little different but I'm

1024
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,960
going to try to make it look like this

1025
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm going to marinate the

1026
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,960

1027
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,119

1037
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,480
and I'm like am I going to create a

1038
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,000
situation where someone's not going to

1039
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,119
be happy I'm going to slice the ginger

1040
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,599
and I'm going to get the orange juice

1041
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,920
going first of all let's get some orange

1042
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:28,920

here no disrespect to egg lovers no

1047
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,440
disrespect to

1048
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,000
chickens you

1049
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:55,240
know no disrespect to animal protein

1050
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,160
eaters this isn't propaganda because the

1051
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,480
vegans don't know this information they

1052
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:03,319
never did this is not like a vegan

1053
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,280
Channel where it's all about vegan vegan

1054
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:08,319
you're evil if you eat meat you're evil

1055
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,680
if you eat an animal protein this isn't

1056
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,599
what this is this is for all this is for

1057
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,280
vegans plant-based people cuz they end

1058
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,440
up eating eggs anyway they go back to

1059
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,760
eating eggs the minute they get a

1060
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,599
symptom because they're eating you know

1061
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,640
a vegan diet they get exposed exposure

1062
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,920
problems expose to something they're not

1063
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,000
eating um their vegan diet right right

1064
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,319
for what they

1065
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,400
need and so they end up getting sick

1066
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,160
they get their first symptom and what

1067
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,240
happens lo and behold they're freaking

1068
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,319
out and they go back to eggs

1069
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,720
anyway how many people do that there's

1070
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,640
some people I think just in the medical

1071
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,760
medium community that are that are like

1072
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,440
telling people you need to eat meat

1073
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,359
every day and eggs and

1074
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,520
cheese because I'm telling you eating

1075
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,640
medical medium is going to hurt you

1076
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,680
meanwhile they weren't even eating

1077
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,280
medical medium they were eating just fat

1078
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,200
vegan overt fats just vegan food they

1079
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,760
were eating like cupcakes with canola

1080
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,799
oil throughout the years they were just

1081
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,480
eating whatever but it was vegan

1082
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:09,720
meanwhile they'll be like don't eat

1083
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,960
medical medium you should be on eggs and

1084
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,720
cheese and butter I give my kids eggs

1085
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,559
and cheese and butter and lots of it

1086
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,040

1087
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,720

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,160
slice them like this you can slice them

1106
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,359
in different ways I'm going to slice

1107
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,559
them this way hold on here there we

1108
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:24,160

1110
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,640

1116
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,000
here and I'm going to marinate them get

1117
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,079

and we're going to we're not even done I

1133
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,960
have to tell you why it even got to this

1134
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,720
degree eggs were a great survival food

1135
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,720
years ago before 100 years ago they were

1136
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,599
an important

1137
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:46,680
staple and everybody needed to eat them

1138
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,680
everybody they needed to eat them for

1139
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,960
survival okay so I'm marinating let's go

1140
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,520
there we go take a look you guys and see

1141
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,640
what you think how's yours coming along

1142
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,440
cuz I know that we're doing this

1143
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,079
together today do you have everything

1144
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,079
you need if you don't have everything

1145
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,720
just make one without something how

1146
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,359
about that like if you don't have the

1147
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,400
Cabbage then make it without cabbage if

1148
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,359
you don't have the ginger then that's

1149
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,839
okay now I just need a little honey in

1150
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:13,839
here and I'm going to mix it

1151
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,119
up eggs were a really powerful survival

1152
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,720
food people need needed

1153
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:35,240
them they were a

1154
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:38,599
lifesaver famine it stopped families

1155
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:42,440
from starvation in the Dead

1156
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:46,559
Winter chicken coups were

1157
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:49,920
everything everybody had a chicken cpop

1158
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,520
everybody had one if they

1159
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,920
could I'm just mixing this up this is a

1160
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,599
little marinade

1161
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,440
here but the the world has

1162
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,839
changed they manipulated the eggs and

1163
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,720
they ruined eggs on people of course you

1164
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,799
can still enjoy them and have them but

1165
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,599
if you get sick someday you're feeding

1166
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:09,599
whatever pathogens are creating your

1167
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:15,040
sickness it's not your fault they ruin

1168
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,920
the eggs they just they do diabolical

1169
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,559
things that's how the industry Works

1170
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,720
they do diabolical stuff you must know

1171
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:26,200
this by now who doesn't know this by

1172
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,520
now let's make some

1173
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:32,200
nice little fixings

1174
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:34,400
here for our Millet sushi so I'm just

1175
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,799
going to cut this down back here little

1176
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,240
like

1177
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:40,599
that we

1178
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,680
go couple of ways you can slice a

1179
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:47,440
cabbage for

1180
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,440
this you can you can cut it in half this

1181
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,920
way

1182
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:00,440
okay and then I'm going to make

1183
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,400
these nice pieces like this there we go

1184
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,520
you don't want them so big if you do

1185
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,280
them too

1186
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,240
big what's going to happen is it they

1187
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:14,079
could pop through they can break through

1188
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,079
your Nori if if you make them too

1189
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,079
big so I'm doing these slices these

1190
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,559
ribbons right out of

1191
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:25,640
here I don't want them too thick I don't

1192
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,359
want them too thin

1193
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,119
I just don't want big hunky pieces

1194
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:34,319

right boom

1403
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:05,079
the thing is what people don't

1404
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:07,920
realize is that everything does

1405
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:09,359
count when when you're really sick it

1406
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,720
all

1407
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:15,520
counts and so I like

1408
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,480
to get as much information as I can out

1409
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,039
to people so they can make a decision

1410
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,480
themselves conscious Choice how can you

1411
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:23,279
make a choice if you don't know the

1412
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,559
truth about something how can you make a

1413
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:27,960
choice if you don't know what's really

01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:30,920
happening out there how you might have

1415
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,240
been tricked or duped in life

1417
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,160
know what's going down if you don't know

1418
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,119

1458
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,480
lot of beginners when when they make

1459
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:58,400
Nori they make a Nori roll I see a lot

1460
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,839
of

1461
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:05,480
beginners they have to have the sushi

1462
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:06,720
mat and it comes out disastrous or it

1463
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,640
takes them

1464
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,640
forever like rolling them up T like

1465
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,200

1467
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,679
the trick with your hands really easily

1468
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,719
and you don't need to use a sushi mat

1469
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:24,480
you just don't have to now if you get

1470
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:26,239
brand new sheets this is to it Nori

1471
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,560
right here if you get brand new sheets

1472
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,920
fresh out of the package they're going

1473
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,799
to be crumbly when you actually roll

1474
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,600
they're going to break apart and just

1475
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:37,480
explode on you you're just going to get

1476
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,839
gy everywhere they're going to crack

1477
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,960
they're going to break so I want you

1478
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:42,560
guys to know that that's going to happen

1479
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,279
the minute you take it fresh out of the

1480
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,440
package like that when it's fresh

1481
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,279
toasted and you open up the vacuum

1482
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:51,199
sealed pack they're going to just

1483
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:54,359
explode on you this package was open for

1484
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:56,600
a while moisture kind of got in here

1485
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:58,600
and so what you see now is they're not

1486
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,440
breaking apart look at this it's not

1487
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,040
like falling apart on me check that out

1488
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,080
I don't even have to use a lot of liquid

1489
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,839
on here here's another thing a lot of

1490
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,159
people they'll use a lot of water on

1491
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:13,120
their Nory sheet they'll tear it apart

1492
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:15,839
so they'll actually get a lot of water

1493
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,839
like this right

1494
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,400
here or more water than that and then as

1495
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:25,719
they're rolling it up and putting it

1496
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,719
together it's ripping it's tearing apart

1497
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,000
so you don't have to do that when it's

1498
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,120
in this in this phase right here I

1499
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,239
probably put too much water on that one

1500
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:38,080
so let's go there we go all right now

1501
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,839
this is the marinade what I like to do

1502
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:43,120
is take a little bit of that marinade

1503
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:46,400
and I like to dab it on here a little

1504
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,400
bit like

1505
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,840
this gives it

1506
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:57,600
flavor major flavor

1507
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,600
okay let's get some

1508
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:05,000
Millet now what I'm going to do is if

1509
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:07,000
you keep the lid on the Millet won't

1510
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,960
harden up

1511
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,400
yet if you take the lid off it starts to

1512
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,960
harden up a little bit in the in there

1513
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,400
so it's just about right though where we

1514
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,040
got now you want your Millet to the

1515
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,920
edges you don't want a ton of

1516
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,719
millet just a couple of tablespoons you

1517
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,920
don't want too much

1518
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,520
you won't be able to kind of put

1519
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,520
everything else in but you want just

1520
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:38,640
enough there we

1521
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,120
go you want it to look good when you

1522
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,120
roll this

1523
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,920
up

1524
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:58,239
okay recipes for from the brain saver

1525
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,800
book protocols all right let's pop in a

1526
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:03,600
couple of pieces of

1527
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,960
carrot two pieces I allow myself two

1528
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,120
pieces of carrot I'm going to put a

1529
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,280
couple of

1530
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,280
pieces there of

1531
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,480
that

1532
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,560
cucumber I'm going to put a couple of

1533
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:18,520
these in now this one might be bigger

1534
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:21,640
than I wanted but it's going to still be

1535
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,960
good and you can choose how you want to

1536
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,159
do it doesn't matter if anything sticks

1537
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,640
out the side

1538
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:31,280
don't

1539
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:33,679
worry okay all right here you go now you

1540
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,280
got your Ginger marinade right here I'm

1541
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,639
not going to put it inside the rollup

1542
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,360
but it's still like that I still have to

1543
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:42,679
make the Wasabi but let's just do this

1544
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,199
first okay by

1545
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,960
hand you're going to get some little bit

1546
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:48,440
cracks and sometimes whatever but that

1547
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,320
is it right

1548
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,120
there

1549
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:56,040
okay now I can slice that now and give

1550
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:59,480
you just a real quick show of it I'll

1551
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:04,920
put it over

1552
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:04,920
here one of the tricks is when you

1553
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:12,480
slice you don't want to push down you

1554
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:15,400
want to like slice you're going like the

1555
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,120
saw action see what I'm doing letting

1556
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,639
you guys know so so it's not going to

1557
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,199
get destroyed on you I don't like the

1558
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:24,040
ends too small because they'll just fall

1559
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:27,280
apart so I like it

1560
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:31,280
big enough now I'm doing a

1561
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:33,480
saw there we go and I cut right down to

1562
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,480
the

1563
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,320
bone take a look you can make them

1564
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:44,639
smaller if you really want but I'm

1565
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,639
making a pretty good bite size look at

1566
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,920
this remember you got to do the sawing

1567
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,199
action make sure your knife is pretty

1568
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,520
sharp make sure it's not too dull now I

1569
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:55,800
got a problem here at the end you can

1570
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,440
use this as one big end just like that

1571
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,840
or you can cut it and get one more out

1572
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,840
of it I'm going to try to cut and get

1573
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,639
one more out of it who knows what we get

1574
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,719
okay

1575
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:10,000
yep all right I just want to get this

1576
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:10,000
first

1577
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,800
one on

1578
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,320
here you know I've made them so many

1579
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,360
times meaning different Nori rolls for

1580
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,360
so many years

1581
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,960
right so you got a couple little pieces

1582
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,360
of Mill it around but there you go

1583
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,360
that's the start let's make some

1584
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,719
more kind of clean off your board a

1585
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,440
little bit so you don't have Millet on

1586
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,440
everything let's get another

1587
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,920
sheet now the reason why I'm choosing

1588
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,960
Millet and not rice a lot of people

1589
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,239
sensitive to Rice

1590
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,120
people need an option

1591
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:03,239
Millet has the

1592
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,239
potential of being the least

1593
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:09,840
inflammatory it's the safest grain there

1594
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:12,120
is hands down if you're a grain person

1595
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,800
and you're eating a ton of rice I would

1596
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:20,000
flip to Millet if you guys are okay with

1597
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,280
that so let's get some Millet on

1598
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,280
here did I say

1599
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,280
millet

1600
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,280
okay let's move this best we can

1601
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,440
over there we

1602
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:38,679
go

1603
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:42,679
okay it's the least irritating for

1604
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:45,719
people it's the least mucus

1605
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:47,199
forming okay a lot of people have mucus

1606
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:49,239
they have a lot of

1607
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,400
mucus because they're dealing with all

1608
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:52,040
kinds of different stuff that I've

1609
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,199
talked about the medical medium

1610
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:57,360
information but it's the least mucus

1611
01:14:55,199 --> 01:15:00,600
forming in the

1612
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,960
body it's an what I call an alkaline

1613
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,920
grain that's a big deal all on its

1614
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:10,199
own it's one of the only

1615
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:13,280
grains that isn't that that's an what I

1616
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:16,679
call an alkaline it's high on its pH

1617
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:20,159
it's High baby it's high all right let's

1618
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:22,199
get some of this here carrots get a

1619
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:24,320
couple of them in

1620
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:26,800
here

1621
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,320
nice I'm putting three carrots in here

1622
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,320
this time let's get some of the cucumber

1623
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,560
in

1624
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,880
here so if you're somebody that's doing

1625
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:38,000
grains anyway like your big thing like

1626
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:41,480
you're like look I'm I'm macrobiotic I'm

1627
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
all grains there's some dinosaurs left

1628
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,639
maybe that are like macrobiotic people

1629
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,800
like I'm pretty sure there there's

1630
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:49,480
there's not too many out there anymore

1631
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,199
they've been just beat they've had so

1632
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,320
many beatdowns about grains being so bad

1633
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:57,840
right all right so we got all that in

1634
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,199
there let's roll this baby roll this

1635
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,639
puppy like I said I don't like the sushi

1636
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:03,639
mat I like it by

1637
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:09,480
hand got a little tear on that one on

1638
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:13,040
the back end and that will happen I

1639
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,280
might not put any more moisture on these

1640
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,120
but there we

1641
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,120
go may cut this one

1642
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,840
here do some sawing

1643
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:26,600
action now it's inab

1644
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,320
you're going to get braks no matter what

1645
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:31,760
in your Nory

1646
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:35,120

01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,560
okay I'm going to leave this one just

1667
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,040
like

1668
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:36,679

1669
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:39,880
break let's get some Millet on here I'm

1739
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,800
grain it's the only grain that's

1740
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,400
actually

1741
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,320
alkaline if that like matters to you

1742
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,280

1747
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:27,840
that's what this

1748
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:34,400

1749
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:38,400
cucumber let's not be a nemic about it

let's roll this puppy

1753
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:50,440
up all

1754
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:53,159
right thing is with

1755
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,639
people you know I told totally

1756
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:57,600
understand it's like you get programmed

1757
01:21:54,639 --> 01:22:02,159
on the food you eat and you can't break

1758
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:04,400
it and then even if you've healed you go

1759
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,760
back to that food you know you go back

1760
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,800
to that food there's a break in that one

1761
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:12,159
it's a little bit more

1762
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:16,159
difficult that Nory sheet let's make

1763
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:16,159
another let's get this one up

1764
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,920
here let's go there we

1765
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,320
go

1766
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:27,560
a lot of people will use medical medium

1767
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,239
information and they'll start

1768
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,840
healing they'll spend 2 years 3 years on

1769
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:35,719
it they've gotten rid of 10 out of their

1770
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:38,800
20 symptoms that no doctor could get rid

1771
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:40,480
of they've gotten rid of 15 symptoms out

1772
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,719
of their 20 symptoms that no doctor can

1773
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:46,920
get rid of no practitioner can get rid

1774
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:49,239
of no self-help course can get rid

1775
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,600
of they started recovering started

1776
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:52,000
getting better and better started

1777
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,560
talking about the medical medium

1778
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,239
information supporting the medical

1779
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,560
medium information talking about how

1780
01:22:55,239 --> 01:23:00,040
great it

1781
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,320
is they get to a point they're just sick

1782
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:07,199
of doing

1783
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:07,199
it or you know they want to do something

1784
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:15,000
else meanwhile without that medical meme

1785
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,320
information they wouldn't be in the

1786
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,320
place they

1787
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,360
are

1788
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,320
all right we got some cucumber in here

1789
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,520
I'm doing four pieces of cucumber I'm

1790
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,360
going to do

1791
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,840
two carrot sticks right there let's get

1792
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,679
some more cabbage I really like

1793
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,880
these and then we're going to do some

1794
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:41,840
Wasabi we're almost there all right now

1795
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,840
keep in mind the Cabbage will tear into

1796
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,960
this these norish sheets you know hard

1797
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:49,880
like crunchy vegetables will actually

1798
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,960
rip and tear in so you you when you're

1799
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,920
rolling it up this is when you can tear

1800
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,440
you know but yet you want it tight

1801
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,440
enough because you don't want it Loose

1802
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,600
there you go that's actually a really

1803
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,600
good

1804
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,800
one

1805
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:08,400
okay py Ren says I always feel better

1806
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,280
after watching aw live just like with

PNP Pride and Prejudice Pride and

1808
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:18,440
Prejudice 1995 version critical to know

1809
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,639
more light-hearted and even symptoms

1810
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:24,120
pull back so your nervous system is

1811
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:26,560
relaxing when you're watching medical

1812
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:29,239
medium and so so your nervous system is

1813
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,360
calming down your mind

1814
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:35,520
calms y listen to my audio on telegram I

or four um audio clips that I did about

1821
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,159
Pride and Prejudice how how important it

1822
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,880
is how how like healing it is why

1823
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:01,719
because Darkness wasn't in the film

1824
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:03,400
production on that you know because the

1825
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:06,560

1826
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,639
lot of documentaries and a lot of movies

1827
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,719
a lot of TV there's Darkness

1828
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,520
involved on all kinds of levels and

1829
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:16,320

line if you don't like Jane Austin

1836
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,840
originally whatever it is it's really

1837
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,239

1899
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:47,679
touch go a little bit at a time you

1900
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,760

1901
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,400

1902
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:55,040

1903
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,400
some consistency you don't want it dry

1904
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,679
to the Bone either so I'm going to go

1905
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,679
one

1906
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,119
tablespoon I'm going to go with another

1907
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:08,920
tablespoon right

1908
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:11,560

1912
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,800
Wasabi together in the mix you'll ruin

1913
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,679
the flavor of the wasabi you'll destroy

1914
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,679
