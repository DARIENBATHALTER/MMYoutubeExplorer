[186.32 - 190.32] okay so
[187.44 - 191.60] if everyone is worried about what
[190.32 - 193.44] they're eating
[191.60 - 194.80] because they have a symptom or condition
[193.44 - 196.72] so when you get a symptom
[194.80 - 198.16] when you get diagnosed with a condition
[196.72 - 198.96] you're worried about what you're eating
[198.16 - 201.20] right
[198.96 - 202.24] you know and the whole bit and you're
[201.20 - 204.32] told that
[202.24 - 205.52] it must be your foods causing the
[204.32 - 207.28] problem right
[205.52 - 209.20] it's your food causing the problem of
[207.28 - 209.92] your symptom it's the food causing the
[209.20 - 212.48] problem of your
[209.92 - 214.48] of your condition you know and because
[212.48 - 215.68] that happens to so many people where
[214.48 - 217.52] they're you know they're worried about
[215.68 - 220.24] that and then they get told hey
[217.52 - 221.04] you know it's these foods then how come
[220.24 - 223.52] so many people
[221.04 - 225.36] are allowed to eat whatever they want
[223.52 - 226.16] how come so many people are allowed to
[225.36 - 228.56] eat
[226.16 - 231.04] whatever they want to eat you know and
[228.56 - 233.04] they can eat it for years and years and
[231.04 - 233.76] years and years you know i hear about it
[233.04 - 236.40] all the time
[233.76 - 237.84] you know my parents can eat anything
[236.40 - 239.44] they want at age 80.
[237.84 - 241.44] my grandparents can eat whatever they
[239.44 - 242.64] want in their 90s and they still are
[241.44 - 244.00] eating whatever they want they could
[242.64 - 245.92] have gluten they can have
[244.00 - 248.56] anything dairy products all this stuff
[245.92 - 249.76] they can eat junk they can have packaged
[248.56 - 252.48] donuts
[249.76 - 254.08] packaged donuts not even not even a
[252.48 - 255.44] donut from a donut shop
[254.08 - 257.20] and they can just eat what they want to
[255.44 - 258.24] do and how come they can do it and
[257.20 - 260.16] they're not worried
[258.24 - 262.08] what about that whole thing they're not
[260.16 - 263.36] worried about what they're eating what
[262.08 - 265.52] they're not eating they're not
[263.36 - 266.48] they're not even thinking about it okay
[265.52 - 268.40] and then
[266.48 - 270.08] what about people who like now like
[268.40 - 271.52] everybody's worried they got a symptom
[270.08 - 273.52] they got a condition
[271.52 - 275.12] and now they're worried it's incredible
[273.52 - 276.96] because there's a reason
[275.12 - 279.12] and maybe look maybe you're one of the
[276.96 - 280.96] people that you're thinking like well
[279.12 - 282.80] you know the foods got me sick and
[280.96 - 284.96] that's why i finally got a symptom
[282.80 - 286.40] that's why i finally got a condition
[284.96 - 288.80] well so for you
[286.40 - 290.48] it took to your 20 to get a symptom and
[288.80 - 292.56] the foods got you sick
[290.48 - 293.60] why but why didn't they get like someone
[292.56 - 295.36] who's 85
[293.60 - 296.80] sick why can they eat all the gluten
[295.36 - 298.24] they want to eat why can't they eat
[296.80 - 302.32] everything they want to eat
[298.24 - 304.96] look so um die you said my parents 96 94
[302.32 - 306.08] so annoying they're uh they won't they
[304.96 - 307.60] won't listen
[306.08 - 309.92] oh my god you know and they're probably
[307.60 - 310.96] eating what they want right 94 and 96
[309.92 - 314.24] years old
[310.96 - 315.36] and but yet you can be 40 years old and
[314.24 - 317.04] we're worried about what we're eating
[315.36 - 318.40] because we're dealing with symptoms
[317.04 - 320.64] because that's the whole thing
[318.40 - 322.40] everybody's getting symptoms now young
[320.64 - 323.44] and younger and younger and getting
[322.40 - 324.48] sicker with these symptoms and
[323.44 - 326.48] conditions
[324.48 - 328.24] and but the thing here there's a lot of
[326.48 - 330.72] issues about this so
[328.24 - 331.68] let's talk about that right now too okay
[330.72 - 335.36] and
[331.68 - 337.84] you know it's there's
[335.36 - 338.40] how come how come someone doesn't get a
[337.84 - 340.72] symptom
[338.40 - 342.96] and how come somebody does get a symptom
[340.72 - 346.24] all right science and research
[342.96 - 347.20] both conventional and alternative don't
[346.24 - 350.08] know why
[347.20 - 352.00] someone gets tingles numbness mysterious
[350.08 - 353.60] you know mysterious tingles numbness
[352.00 - 355.52] aches and pains it's mysterious
[353.60 - 357.76] dizziness vertigo okay
[355.52 - 358.72] uh floaters in the eyes that are
[357.76 - 361.20] mysterious
[358.72 - 362.08] burning skin jaw pain that's mysterious
[361.20 - 363.68] it won't go away
[362.08 - 365.56] neck pain that's mysterious and won't go
[363.68 - 367.76] away migraines
[365.56 - 369.36] fibromyalgia all the different other
[367.76 - 370.72] conditions oh my god you can list all
[369.36 - 372.64] the autoimmune conditions science
[370.72 - 375.28] research doesn't know it causes eczema
[372.64 - 376.96] psoriasis all these different things so
[375.28 - 380.08] it goes on and on and on
[376.96 - 382.40] okay and but here's the deal
[380.08 - 384.72] science and research both conventional
[382.40 - 387.12] and alternative believe
[384.72 - 388.64] that your body's attacking itself and in
[387.12 - 389.52] the i'm telling you right now mark my
[388.64 - 391.76] words on this
[389.52 - 392.56] just mark them right here and right now
[391.76 - 395.76] all right
[392.56 - 396.48] that pretty soon coming up every single
[395.76 - 400.32] symptom
[396.48 - 401.84] every single condition somebody has
[400.32 - 404.08] every single symptom every single
[401.84 - 406.08] condition somebody has
[404.08 - 408.72] it's gonna be called autoimmune no
[406.08 - 410.48] matter what it's going to be rare few
[408.72 - 411.92] symptoms or conditions they're not going
[410.48 - 412.72] to call autoimmune they're going to
[411.92 - 415.20] package up
[412.72 - 417.20] everybody's mysterious symptom
[415.20 - 418.32] everybody's mysterious condition
[417.20 - 420.16] and they're going to lump it into
[418.32 - 420.96] autoimmune because alternative
[420.16 - 423.84] conventional
[420.96 - 424.64] research in science medicine only
[423.84 - 426.24] believe
[424.64 - 428.56] that your body's destroying itself that
[426.24 - 429.92] your body's creating this auto antibody
[428.56 - 431.52] and it's going out to destroy your
[429.92 - 432.88] glands like your thyroid condition is
[431.52 - 434.48] because your body's attacking it
[432.88 - 436.08] your eczema your psoriasis because your
[434.48 - 437.36] body's attacking your skin it's
[436.08 - 439.52] attacking your body
[437.36 - 441.04] so that's how it's done right let's see
[439.52 - 442.48] alternative medicine though and i'm
[441.04 - 444.16] going to get into all the food stuff
[442.48 - 445.28] it's so important we're on all things
[444.16 - 448.48] food tonight
[445.28 - 452.08] alternative medicine believes
[448.48 - 454.80] that foods are triggering our autoimmune
[452.08 - 455.60] foods are a trigger because alternative
[454.80 - 458.56] medicine
[455.60 - 459.52] science research doesn't know why we're
[458.56 - 460.96] sick either
[459.52 - 462.72] they don't know why we're sick either so
[460.96 - 464.80] they're like well gluten is triggering
[462.72 - 466.72] off your autoimmune gluten is triggering
[464.80 - 468.72] off your body's problem well
[466.72 - 470.64] interesting well how come all these
[468.72 - 472.08] people that are older in the generation
[470.64 - 474.08] they're 90 years old they're 85 years
[472.08 - 478.00] old they're 80 years old you guys
[474.08 - 481.28] and they're not getting triggered
[478.00 - 483.76] by gluten they're not getting triggered
[481.28 - 485.92] by dairy products they're not getting
[483.76 - 488.56] triggered by something okay
[485.92 - 490.80] it's because the younger generation now
[488.56 - 493.28] has a lot of bugs and a lot more
[490.80 - 495.12] toxins a lot more bugs and a lot more
[493.28 - 497.28] toxins that's why
[495.12 - 498.56] and so when you have a lot more bugs and
[497.28 - 500.08] a lot more toxins
[498.56 - 501.68] you end up getting symptoms and you end
[500.08 - 503.52] up getting them early on
[501.68 - 506.24] you know getting them at 19 years old 20
[503.52 - 508.96] years old 22 years old 25 years old
[506.24 - 510.64] you know getting at 35 40 however it is
[508.96 - 511.52] you end up getting all these symptoms
[510.64 - 512.96] all these conditions
[511.52 - 514.56] you get diagnosed with the lyme you get
[512.96 - 515.52] diagnosed with the fibro the multiple
[514.56 - 517.52] sclerosis
[515.52 - 518.88] uh you get diagnosed with fibromyalgia
[517.52 - 520.56] all like i said that all these
[518.88 - 522.88] rheumatoid arthritis you get all these
[520.56 - 524.72] different diagnoses and
[522.88 - 526.40] and that's what happens in the end okay
[524.72 - 527.92] and so now
[526.40 - 529.76] we're in this point where we have to
[527.92 - 530.56] choose a belief system a diet belief
[529.76 - 532.56] system
[530.56 - 535.60] because we're being pushed into it we're
[532.56 - 538.00] being pushed into having to choose
[535.60 - 539.28] a diet belief system should i go vegan
[538.00 - 541.04] should i go plant-based
[539.28 - 542.96] should i start a keto diet should i
[541.04 - 543.60] start a keto vegan diet should i start a
[542.96 - 545.60] keto
[543.60 - 548.16] animal protein diet should i do
[545.60 - 549.76] carnivore what should i do and you know
[548.16 - 552.00] and everybody's got their own tips
[549.76 - 554.32] they're like try carnivore try keto
[552.00 - 556.16] try this try that and there's all these
[554.32 - 558.16] different belief systems we're getting
[556.16 - 560.40] pushed into because we have no choice
[558.16 - 562.48] because we want a quick fix we want an
[560.40 - 564.48] answer because we're not getting an
[562.48 - 564.88] answer from science or research to why
[564.48 - 566.16] we're
[564.88 - 568.72] really sick with all these different
[566.16 - 570.24] symptoms and conditions so we get pushed
[568.72 - 572.56] into this so now we're getting to where
[570.24 - 573.44] now we gotta pick a diet belief system
[572.56 - 575.28] we get pushed into
[573.44 - 577.28] we end up getting totally brain screwed
[575.28 - 578.48] in the end that's what happens and it's
[577.28 - 580.64] really sad
[578.48 - 581.92] because you know in the end it's not all
[580.64 - 585.76] about food
[581.92 - 587.76] it's not all about food in the end
[585.76 - 588.88] it's about something else it's about the
[587.76 - 592.00] bugs we have
[588.88 - 594.16] inside of us is what it is
[592.00 - 596.00] it's about the epstein bars it's about
[594.16 - 597.68] this the shingles viruses it's about
[596.00 - 599.76] cytomegalovirus it's about if you got
[597.68 - 602.08] the herpes simplex one
[599.76 - 604.08] the cold sore a fever blister a fever
[602.08 - 604.40] blister is simplex okay so that's herpes
[604.08 - 606.56] right
[604.40 - 608.32] so you got the fever blister okay well
[606.56 - 609.20] when that fever blister heals up and
[608.32 - 611.28] it's gone
[609.20 - 612.72] the virus still creates symptoms it
[611.28 - 614.16] still can give you headaches it still
[612.72 - 615.76] can give you jaw pain it still can give
[614.16 - 616.24] you neck pain it still can make you feel
[615.76 - 617.68] weird
[616.24 - 619.60] it can still give you some braid fog it
[617.68 - 622.00] can give you all kinds of stuff
[619.60 - 623.44] but the bottom line is we have all these
[622.00 - 626.08] different pathogens in
[623.44 - 627.04] all of us we have the epstein bars we
[626.08 - 629.52] have
[627.04 - 630.96] sediment virus we got the simplexes we
[629.52 - 633.04] got the streptococcus
[630.96 - 634.32] and because of that and because so many
[633.04 - 638.24] people are dealing with so
[634.32 - 641.36] many pathogens and pathogenic issues
[638.24 - 642.80] where we're we end up like
[641.36 - 644.16] looking in all kind of alternative
[642.80 - 645.44] sources because eventual medicine
[644.16 - 646.40] doesn't believe food has anything to do
[645.44 - 648.32] with anything
[646.40 - 649.52] alternative medicine believes that
[648.32 - 651.36] food's important
[649.52 - 652.64] food is medicine alternate medicine
[651.36 - 654.80] believes food is medicine
[652.64 - 655.68] alternative medicine though still though
[654.80 - 658.00] doesn't know
[655.68 - 659.52] why everybody's sick with autoimmune
[658.00 - 660.96] conditions so they call it autoimmune
[659.52 - 662.32] the body attacking stuff they still
[660.96 - 663.28] don't know why they'll say maybe it's
[662.32 - 664.96] leaky gut
[663.28 - 666.88] maybe it's something else maybe it's
[664.96 - 667.76] candida maybe it's this theory maybe
[666.88 - 669.84] it's that
[667.76 - 671.68] and they're still confused so what
[669.84 - 672.32] happens it leads to people to start like
[671.68 - 674.24] okay
[672.32 - 676.08] what do we do we gotta we gotta think
[674.24 - 676.88] about foods get off of processed foods
[676.08 - 678.72] get off of
[676.88 - 680.48] uh fried foods get off of greasy foods
[678.72 - 682.32] get off of fast foods start with that
[680.48 - 684.40] you start feeling better you know get
[682.32 - 686.64] off of that thing but it squeezes us
[684.40 - 688.40] and we end up squeezing down to now
[686.64 - 689.92] we're afraid of all kinds of things to
[688.40 - 691.12] eating and then we gotta pick a diet
[689.92 - 693.04] belief system
[691.12 - 695.28] think about it would anybody go vegan or
[693.04 - 697.12] plant-based would how many people would
[695.28 - 697.60] really go vegan or plant-based if they
[697.12 - 699.84] weren't
[697.60 - 702.16] pushed that direction because they were
[699.84 - 704.56] having a symptom or a condition right
[702.16 - 706.32] of course you get the crowd that the you
[704.56 - 707.44] know the animal rights crowd of course
[706.32 - 709.44] and the animal rights crowd
[707.44 - 710.72] they'll go vegan or plant-based some of
[709.44 - 711.28] them will go vegan or plant-based
[710.72 - 712.40] because
[711.28 - 714.16] you know the whole thing of killing
[712.40 - 714.72] animals and all that okay for sure
[714.16 - 716.56] they'll
[714.72 - 717.92] be that crowd but the majority of the
[716.56 - 718.32] plant-based movement which is still
[717.92 - 720.96] small
[718.32 - 721.76] the majority of the vegan movement which
[720.96 - 723.76] is still small
[721.76 - 725.12] they're they're all about their symptoms
[723.76 - 727.28] end up pushing them
[725.12 - 728.32] into more plant-based or into
[727.28 - 730.08] plant-based
[728.32 - 731.84] because why would they ever do that same
[730.08 - 733.36] thing with like with the paleo crowd or
[731.84 - 734.32] the keto crowd or the animal protein
[733.36 - 736.16] crowd you think
[734.32 - 737.60] they would actually eat really clean
[736.16 - 739.04] like they do and and
[737.60 - 740.88] and keep out the processed foods and
[739.04 - 742.40] keep out all the bad stuff and keep the
[740.88 - 744.48] gluten out for good
[742.40 - 746.00] and you think they'd actually do that if
[744.48 - 747.92] they didn't have to because they weren't
[746.00 - 749.44] developing some kind of symptom of some
[747.92 - 750.72] kind they weren't developing some kind
[749.44 - 752.64] of issue of some kind
[750.72 - 754.08] you think they wouldn't i mean people
[752.64 - 755.44] would want to eat pizza every night they
[754.08 - 756.72] would want to eat pizza a few times a
[755.44 - 757.36] week they would want pizza on their
[756.72 - 759.44] weekends
[757.36 - 760.40] they would want they would want all
[759.44 - 762.64] their different
[760.40 - 764.48] foods their mac and cheese all these
[762.64 - 766.88] other things that's what they want to do
[764.48 - 769.20] but people are getting pushed into
[766.88 - 771.28] eating healthier and healthier
[769.20 - 773.04] because their symptoms are actually
[771.28 - 776.08] driving them there
[773.04 - 776.64] and then alternative medicine will tell
[776.08 - 778.48] them well
[776.64 - 780.08] gluten is causing your condition well
[778.48 - 781.84] that's interesting because it didn't
[780.08 - 782.32] cause your condition for the first 15
[781.84 - 783.52] years
[782.32 - 785.76] in your life and then you develop
[783.52 - 787.60] symptoms years later it wasn't the
[785.76 - 791.04] gluten that created
[787.60 - 793.12] that symptom 20 years later it wasn't
[791.04 - 795.20] it wasn't you know something else that
[793.12 - 796.56] created that symptom 20 30 years of
[795.20 - 799.12] years later
[796.56 - 800.96] so what did it and it's these pathogens
[799.12 - 803.04] i'm talking about in the whole bit
[800.96 - 804.16] so you know if we got a lot to cover
[803.04 - 805.36] we're going to talk about oxalates
[804.16 - 806.24] oxalic acid we're going to talk about
[805.36 - 807.36] like spinach
[806.24 - 808.56] people are worried about spinach
[807.36 - 810.08] cruciferous we're going to talk about
[808.56 - 811.68] that the gorgogenic foods
[810.08 - 813.12] going to talk about lectins we're going
[811.68 - 814.48] to talk about histamines
[813.12 - 816.24] you're going to want to hang on for this
[814.48 - 817.60] ride because this is a big night
[816.24 - 819.28] fructose intolerance we're going to
[817.60 - 819.84] cover that too so if you're somebody
[819.28 - 821.52] that
[819.84 - 822.96] you want to know about the stuff and i'm
[821.52 - 824.72] going to be answering questions as we go
[822.96 - 826.72] along some watching the monitor too
[824.72 - 830.24] right here with all the questions so
[826.72 - 833.36] um okay uh minerva
[830.24 - 835.52] is it true that eggs feed viruses yes
[833.36 - 837.68] that's medical medium information that's
[835.52 - 838.24] where that originates from and yes it's
[837.68 - 842.08] true
[838.24 - 845.12] because pathogens were were created
[842.08 - 847.44] they were raised in eggs and eggs
[845.12 - 848.16] feeding them in the labs over the last
[847.44 - 851.12] 80
[848.16 - 852.08] 90 years pathogens were used i mean
[851.12 - 854.80] pathogens
[852.08 - 855.28] were basically raised using eggs as a
[854.80 - 857.04] food
[855.28 - 858.64] so what happens is when we eat our eggs
[857.04 - 860.08] you may not feel anything now but as
[858.64 - 862.56] years go on your eggs are
[860.08 - 863.52] feeding viruses so once again it's not
[862.56 - 866.64] the egg's fault
[863.52 - 868.16] eggs were an amazing survival food and a
[866.64 - 870.48] tasty one at that
[868.16 - 872.00] but what happened is they ruined our
[870.48 - 873.68] eggs the industries ruined our eggs and
[872.00 - 875.12] i talk about that a lot all the time and
[873.68 - 875.84] i talk about that and cleanse the heal
[875.12 - 877.84] if you guys
[875.84 - 879.20] get a copy of this you'll learn so much
[877.84 - 881.28] it's unbelievable really
[879.20 - 882.40] uh pamela says that's me plant-based
[881.28 - 885.68] because of symptoms
[882.40 - 887.12] pamela exactly and because you really
[885.68 - 888.64] wouldn't be plant-based right
[887.12 - 890.16] you wouldn't be if it wasn't for the
[888.64 - 891.44] symptoms pushing you into it
[890.16 - 894.00] same thing with a lot of people eating
[891.44 - 895.92] like clean paleo and no carbs or
[894.00 - 898.08] no doughnuts no cakes no cookies you
[895.92 - 899.44] know like what no bagels with cream
[898.08 - 901.36] cheese or whatever it's like
[899.44 - 902.88] okay well we would stop those bagels and
[901.36 - 903.76] cream cheese we would stop bagels and
[902.88 - 906.64] butter
[903.76 - 907.84] we would really stop that i mean no
[906.64 - 909.28] people wouldn't want to stop their
[907.84 - 911.12] bagels and butter and all that kind of
[909.28 - 912.88] stuff and all that you know we do we
[911.12 - 914.56] we're being squeezed and pushed into it
[912.88 - 915.68] so i'm glad you i'm totally glad you
[914.56 - 917.92] understand and
[915.68 - 919.12] um so i'm going to cover look there's so
[917.92 - 921.04] much to cover i'm going to talk about
[919.12 - 923.04] oxalates i saw an oxalate question zip
[921.04 - 925.68] through and zip up right there
[923.04 - 927.60] and i'm going to talk about that too so
[925.68 - 929.44] so much information i'm so glad you guys
[927.60 - 931.52] are here hang on for this ride because
[929.44 - 935.20] there's so much to cover
[931.52 - 936.96] and a lot of info you know
[935.20 - 940.56] when it comes to information about food
[936.96 - 942.80] there's so much misinformation out there
[940.56 - 944.56] and that's where we get stuck that's
[942.80 - 946.08] where the chase happens that's where the
[944.56 - 947.84] guessing games happen
[946.08 - 949.60] that's where it's like we're totally
[947.84 - 951.52] guessing and we're looking around at
[949.60 - 952.96] every corner for a new thing or a quick
[951.52 - 954.96] fix and we're like
[952.96 - 956.32] what's what's the histamine foods what
[954.96 - 958.16] are the histamine foods
[956.32 - 959.92] what are the oxalate foods what are the
[958.16 - 963.92] nightshades what are the
[959.92 - 967.12] lectins what are the oxalates
[963.92 - 968.80] so much information okay um so when it
[967.12 - 970.64] comes when it comes to information about
[968.80 - 972.40] food there's so much misinformation out
[970.64 - 974.88] there we can call it smog
[972.40 - 975.60] we can call it you know uh just
[974.88 - 978.72] basically
[975.60 - 982.16] noise we can call it noise too but
[978.72 - 983.12] there's there's um okay so cheryl hey
[982.16 - 986.32] cheryl
[983.12 - 987.52] exactly you did this i was vegan for
[986.32 - 989.84] four years
[987.52 - 991.84] before medical medium and doing it all
[989.84 - 993.04] wrong because really what is medical
[991.84 - 995.92] medium information sharing
[993.04 - 997.60] medical medium information is not about
[995.92 - 999.76] a diet belief system
[997.60 - 1001.52] and that's the confusion out there i
[999.76 - 1003.12] noticed that some of the naysayers they
[1001.52 - 1003.84] just want to package it up like oh he's
[1003.12 - 1005.44] just a
[1003.84 - 1007.44] there's plant-based information better
[1005.44 - 1010.08] than his because he's a bad plant-based
[1007.44 - 1011.36] what are you talking about like medical
[1010.08 - 1015.20] medium information
[1011.36 - 1017.12] welcomes all diets all diet systems
[1015.20 - 1018.80] in whatever diet belief systems because
[1017.12 - 1020.16] it's not about
[1018.80 - 1022.40] it's about if you're going to be
[1020.16 - 1024.80] plant-based be plant-based
[1022.40 - 1025.60] exactly sure be plant-based so but let's
[1024.80 - 1027.84] do it right
[1025.60 - 1029.36] if you're going to be animal products
[1027.84 - 1030.80] let's do it right if you're going to be
[1029.36 - 1033.60] doing animal products
[1030.80 - 1034.72] exactly because it's about other things
[1033.60 - 1036.48] it's about other things
[1034.72 - 1038.00] and so you got these food wars i always
[1036.48 - 1039.68] talk about the the the
[1038.00 - 1041.20] controversial food wars it's like the
[1039.68 - 1043.36] animal protein people
[1041.20 - 1044.48] you're all pissed off at the plant the
[1043.36 - 1046.80] plant protein people
[1044.48 - 1047.84] the you know the animal based diets all
[1046.80 - 1049.52] you know they're all upset about the
[1047.84 - 1051.04] plant-based diet so you got that whole
[1049.52 - 1052.32] thing confusion going on meanwhile
[1051.04 - 1053.84] they're all sick
[1052.32 - 1055.68] you know it's incredible i'm reading out
[1053.84 - 1057.52] a ton to heal right now meanwhile all
[1055.68 - 1059.68] sides in the food wars which is
[1057.52 - 1061.52] like all sides got all the different
[1059.68 - 1064.24] food diet belief systems okay
[1061.52 - 1065.84] meanwhile everybody still gets sick
[1064.24 - 1067.12] everybody still gets their symptoms they
[1065.84 - 1068.72] still get their conditions they don't
[1067.12 - 1070.08] know what's causing them

[1084.64 - 1088.32] symptoms of conditions in there
[1085.92 - 1089.60] amanda says lovey anthony you saved my
[1088.32 - 1091.92] life
[1089.60 - 1092.88] you know um means a lot to me means a
[1091.92 - 1095.12] lot to me
[1092.88 - 1096.32] told my liver was so full of cancer on
[1095.12 - 1099.84] march 18th
[1096.32 - 1101.28] i'd be dead or dying by now liver rescue
[1099.84 - 1103.52] gave me the answers
[1101.28 - 1104.64] i've looked for on a 10-year cancer
[1103.52 - 1106.64] nightmare trip
[1104.64 - 1108.88] i'm writing about it bless you bless
[1106.64 - 1111.44] your heart amanda god bless you

[1111.44 - 1114.80] really am
[1112.56 - 1115.60] um so let's go into a little bit more of
[1114.80 - 1118.16] this too
[1115.60 - 1119.84] so you know it's funny that the most
[1118.16 - 1122.96] vocal people
[1119.84 - 1125.76] that are on social media okay
[1122.96 - 1126.96] are the people that feel the least sick
[1125.76 - 1129.52] where it's as far as
[1126.96 - 1132.08] vocal in the point where they're vocal
[1129.52 - 1135.12] and they just want to cause like
[1132.08 - 1136.00] shouting matches right like you know you
[1135.12 - 1138.00] know the animal
[1136.00 - 1139.52] protein people they're killing animals
[1138.00 - 1141.28] the animal protein people are saying to
[1139.52 - 1143.20] the vegans you're starving your kids
[1141.28 - 1144.80] you're just feeding them lettuce and you
[1143.20 - 1146.32] know it's terrible what's happening out
[1144.80 - 1147.28] there you know meanwhile they don't know
[1146.32 - 1148.96] what's going on with
[1147.28 - 1150.56] why you have your tingles and numbness
[1148.96 - 1153.52] your aches and pains your
[1150.56 - 1154.16] your itchy skin your hives your chronic
[1153.52 - 1156.32] acne
[1154.16 - 1158.08] they just don't know what's causing all
[1156.32 - 1160.08] this everybody plays these guessing
[1158.08 - 1160.48] games with foods and it's locking us
[1160.08 - 1164.08] down
[1160.48 - 1166.48] to a total brainwashing situation
[1164.08 - 1168.64] where now we're like where do i run from
[1166.48 - 1171.68] now and and how it works so
[1168.64 - 1172.40] um so the whole the whole point is here
[1171.68 - 1173.36] is that
[1172.40 - 1175.60] when you're dealing with multiple
[1173.36 - 1178.16] sclerosis or eczema psoriasis acne lyme
[1175.60 - 1180.88] disease endometriosis pcos
[1178.16 - 1182.40] you know fibroids depression crippling
[1180.88 - 1185.36] anxiety
[1182.40 - 1186.24] crippling anxiety it's critical to know
[1185.36 - 1188.40] why you're sick
[1186.24 - 1189.84] and why you have a symptom and why we
[1188.40 - 1192.32] have a condition
[1189.84 - 1193.28] so okay you guys when we get our first
[1192.32 - 1195.92] symptom
[1193.28 - 1197.20] we don't like how it feels right you
[1195.92 - 1198.32] don't like how it feels when you get
[1197.20 - 1200.96] your first symptom
[1198.32 - 1202.08] so naturally we want an answer to why we
[1200.96 - 1204.08] have a symptom
[1202.08 - 1205.12] like you want an answer like i want to
[1204.08 - 1206.88] answer now why i'm
[1205.12 - 1208.56] got this or i want to answer to why i
[1206.88 - 1210.56] have that you want an answer
[1208.56 - 1212.08] to why you have a symptom right both
[1210.56 - 1215.04] conventional and altered medicine they
[1212.08 - 1217.44] don't have the answers to why we're sick
[1215.04 - 1218.96] but yet they still have help they still
[1217.44 - 1220.32] can help they still can do all kinds of
[1218.96 - 1221.68] great testing they still have
[1220.32 - 1223.20] they still have band-aids they still
[1221.68 - 1223.76] have all kinds of stuff and of course we
[1223.20 - 1225.76] have
[1223.76 - 1227.84] you know we have you know really really
[1225.76 - 1229.04] powerful like neurosurgery surgery we
[1227.84 - 1230.24] have all kinds of different things we
[1229.04 - 1231.12] have great surgeons we have great
[1230.24 - 1232.96] medical
[1231.12 - 1234.48] you know science research in other areas
[1232.96 - 1235.92] but when it comes down to autoimmune and
[1234.48 - 1237.36] chronic illness and all these different
[1235.92 - 1239.52] symptoms and conditions
[1237.36 - 1242.00] we got the bloating and we got the
[1239.52 - 1244.56] gastroparesis and the digestive problems
[1242.00 - 1246.40] and we got constipation you know without
[1244.56 - 1248.32] knowing why and we have crohn's we have
[1246.40 - 1249.52] colitis we have ibs
[1248.32 - 1251.04] we have all these conditions that
[1249.52 - 1252.56] science research doesn't know about we
[1251.04 - 1254.24] have eczema psoriasis vitiligo
[1252.56 - 1256.16] scleroderma rosacea and science
[1254.24 - 1258.08] researchers know about any of these
[1256.16 - 1259.44] and so when we're uncomfortable and with
[1258.08 - 1261.52] these migraines and
[1259.44 - 1263.76] ocular migraines and floaters in the
[1261.52 - 1265.60] eyes and we don't have answers
[1263.76 - 1266.96] we we get to a point when we're looking
[1265.60 - 1268.88] for answers
[1266.96 - 1271.04] auto you know alternative science
[1268.88 - 1272.72] alternative uh alternative medicine will
[1271.04 - 1275.12] try to say well your foods are
[1272.72 - 1276.16] triggering it they're triggering your
[1275.12 - 1279.44] body
[1276.16 - 1279.76] harming itself that's not correct that
[1279.44 - 1282.80] is
[1279.76 - 1285.52] incorrect information
[1282.80 - 1287.52] incorrect information that's why someone
[1285.52 - 1289.44] could be 60 years old eating what they
[1287.52 - 1290.96] want all the gluten they want
[1289.44 - 1293.20] and they are not getting all these
[1290.96 - 1293.92] symptoms a 25 year old is getting when
[1293.20 - 1296.88] she's getting
[1293.92 - 1298.24] crippling anxiety horrible depression
[1296.88 - 1300.40] itchy skin
[1298.24 - 1301.84] hives everywhere you know all these
[1300.40 - 1303.84] different things and
[1301.84 - 1304.88] and then the 60 year old isn't getting
[1303.84 - 1307.92] any of that
[1304.88 - 1310.16] so basically what it is is people
[1307.92 - 1311.36] they don't like being sick so it makes a
[1310.16 - 1313.12] person miserable
[1311.36 - 1314.80] so when you're in your 20s or in your
[1313.12 - 1319.28] you know 30s whatever it is
[1314.80 - 1321.60] you get trained that maybe it's oxalates
[1319.28 - 1322.48] maybe it's lectins what foods are you
[1321.60 - 1324.80] choosing
[1322.48 - 1326.16] you start you you know you get trained
[1324.80 - 1328.72] to run away
[1326.16 - 1330.08] from the symptom you're experiencing to
[1328.72 - 1332.80] try to find a quick
[1330.08 - 1334.16] fix in some kind of category maybe it's
[1332.80 - 1336.64] night shades
[1334.16 - 1337.36] maybe it's the potato maybe it's
[1336.64 - 1339.52] something else
[1337.36 - 1340.48] and it can put us in a corner like trap
[1339.52 - 1342.48] us like a rat
[1340.48 - 1344.96] and stick us in the corner you guys
[1342.48 - 1346.96] right and it and then it's no fruits
[1344.96 - 1348.40] and you can't have a certain vegetable
[1346.96 - 1349.76] then you can't have cruciferous you
[1348.40 - 1350.48] can't have cauliflower you can't have
[1349.76 - 1352.08] broccoli
[1350.48 - 1353.76] you can't have cabbage you can't have
[1352.08 - 1355.28] brussels sprouts you can't have a
[1353.76 - 1357.28] nightshade you can't have
[1355.28 - 1358.72] you know anything with a lectin in it
[1357.28 - 1360.72] you can't have a bean you can't have an
[1358.72 - 1362.48] oxalate you can't have spinach you can't
[1360.72 - 1363.60] have a leafy green you can't have mush
[1362.48 - 1365.76] you can't have kale
[1363.60 - 1367.84] you can't have um lettuce for some
[1365.76 - 1369.60] reason and so we're told you were even
[1367.84 - 1371.92] told that herbs are problems
[1369.60 - 1373.28] like herbs like chamomile it's part of
[1371.92 - 1374.80] the ragweed family
[1373.28 - 1376.48] so if you're you know a drag weed then
[1374.80 - 1377.20] it's cameo is bad too and you get
[1376.48 - 1379.84] squeezed
[1377.20 - 1381.60] everywhere you go and that's a big
[1379.84 - 1383.36] problem and when you get squeezed
[1381.60 - 1385.04] and you get brain screwed and you get
[1383.36 - 1387.76] squeezed and brain screwed
[1385.04 - 1389.04] you're in less fruits no potatoes no
[1387.76 - 1392.08] herbs no vegetables
[1389.04 - 1394.72] no leafy greens no grains of any kind
[1392.08 - 1396.08] no beans and then you can even get
[1394.72 - 1396.72] squeezed as far and i've seen this
[1396.08 - 1398.80] happen to
[1396.72 - 1400.48] some people not a lot of people but you
[1398.80 - 1402.80] get squeezed this far
[1400.48 - 1404.96] down the rabbit hole into the carnivore
[1402.80 - 1405.52] diet so now we're in just the carnivore
[1404.96 - 1407.92] diet
[1405.52 - 1409.44] okay where it's just meat and only meat
[1407.92 - 1411.44] and only meat and only meat
[1409.44 - 1413.12] and that carnivore diet can go with meat
[1411.44 - 1416.40] turkey and chicken
[1413.12 - 1418.32] and bacon or pork
[1416.40 - 1419.52] but then it could minimize or it can go
[1418.32 - 1421.20] to lamb and meat
[1419.52 - 1422.88] and chicken and then all of a sudden you
[1421.20 - 1424.56] lose your chicken and then because
[1422.88 - 1426.24] you're just squeezing down you're like
[1424.56 - 1427.04] confused as to your why you have
[1426.24 - 1429.20] symptoms
[1427.04 - 1430.80] and it's such it's such a brain problem
[1429.20 - 1431.36] it's like it's not a brain problem it's
[1430.80 - 1433.36] such
[1431.36 - 1434.72] it's such a confusion and then you're
[1433.36 - 1436.64] getting squeezed down
[1434.72 - 1438.40] because the more you squeeze down and
[1436.64 - 1439.44] you're not touching a fruit a vegetable
[1438.40 - 1441.52] a leafy green
[1439.44 - 1443.12] and because of somebody's theories or
[1441.52 - 1444.80] because of how you're feeling
[1443.12 - 1446.16] because you're feeling symptoms and you
[1444.80 - 1447.76] don't know why you don't know what's
[1446.16 - 1449.28] triggering it is something triggering it
[1447.76 - 1451.12] is something activating it
[1449.28 - 1452.32] and you get squeezed down right down to
[1451.12 - 1454.96] the carnivore
[1452.32 - 1455.36] and then things are coming down because
[1454.96 - 1458.80] you're
[1455.36 - 1460.72] minimizing it you're going so mono foods
[1458.80 - 1462.08] and the reason why some people can do
[1460.72 - 1462.96] this and they can go carnivore where
[1462.08 - 1466.32] they're only on
[1462.96 - 1468.72] meat only red meat is because
[1466.32 - 1470.64] red meat won't feed the bugs and i
[1468.72 - 1472.48] talked about this that's why people say
[1470.64 - 1474.08] oh he's a plant-based guy only no i'm
[1472.48 - 1475.92] not always
[1474.08 - 1478.40] he's he's a whatever animal protein guy
[1475.92 - 1479.60] no i'm not i'm neither of anything i'm
[1478.40 - 1482.16] just about the answers
[1479.60 - 1483.68] so you can get better so here's what it
[1482.16 - 1486.32] is like the carnivore people get
[1483.68 - 1490.88] squeezed right down to just meat
[1486.32 - 1492.80] itself and by default and by accident
[1490.88 - 1494.88] they're start they're feeling better for
[1492.80 - 1496.56] the moment and they're feeling better
[1494.88 - 1498.88] for the moment you guys
[1496.56 - 1500.08] because they're not feeding the bugs
[1498.88 - 1501.52] that are creating
[1500.08 - 1503.20] all their symptoms that are creating
[1501.52 - 1504.08] their fatigue their migraines their
[1503.20 - 1505.52] aches and pains
[1504.08 - 1507.44] their floaters in the eyes their tingles
[1505.52 - 1509.76] are numbness their dizziness they're not
[1507.44 - 1510.72] feeding the bugs and they're holding
[1509.76 - 1513.60] back
[1510.72 - 1515.20] leafy greens and fruits or certain
[1513.60 - 1516.96] fruits and certain leafy greens and
[1515.20 - 1519.84] vegetables and herbs
[1516.96 - 1520.96] that would kill the bugs and guess what
[1519.84 - 1525.68] when you kill the
[1520.96 - 1527.92] bugs you feel them sometimes you feel
[1525.68 - 1529.60] similar symptoms to what your symptoms
[1527.92 - 1531.76] are you feel
[1529.60 - 1534.16] the same symptoms to what your symptoms
[1531.76 - 1536.16] are when you're killing the bugs
[1534.16 - 1538.40] you know and this is when you're off
[1536.16 - 1542.64] processed foods too and all this stuff
[1538.40 - 1546.16] and what happens is people don't realize
[1542.64 - 1548.00] that the reactions they're having
[1546.16 - 1550.80] at any given time while they're eating
[1548.00 - 1553.52] healthy foods or healthier foods
[1550.80 - 1554.08] is because they're cleaning out years of
[1553.52 - 1557.12] bug
[1554.08 - 1559.68] toxins that are stored in their liver
[1557.12 - 1561.04] they're cleaning out years of bug toxins
[1559.68 - 1564.08] that are stored
[1561.04 - 1567.12] inside inside their liver
[1564.08 - 1568.00] you know inside inside their body inside
[1567.12 - 1571.04] their spleen
[1568.00 - 1572.88] inside their organs and that's what's
[1571.04 - 1574.96] happening unless they're feeding
[1572.88 - 1576.56] the bugs with foods that actually feed
[1574.96 - 1577.04] the bugs and that's what i talk about
[1576.56 - 1578.56] like in
[1577.04 - 1580.40] cleanse the heel i talk about that's
[1578.56 - 1581.60] what the information is know what foods
[1580.40 - 1584.24] do feed things
[1581.60 - 1585.68] tammy ross i thought the extra fruit
[1584.24 - 1587.68] would make me gain weight
[1585.68 - 1589.04] i'm losing weight just fine on your
[1587.68 - 1591.36] program thank you so much
[1589.04 - 1592.32] incredible tammy everybody gets thrown
[1591.36 - 1593.52] into fruit fear
[1592.32 - 1595.36] it's one of the things that they get
[1593.52 - 1599.28] thrown into it's fruit fear
[1595.36 - 1601.52] but it's it's theories about fruit
[1599.28 - 1602.32] that create fruit fruit fear it's
[1601.52 - 1604.08] theories
[1602.32 - 1605.60] about all these things but what happens
[1604.08 - 1608.72] tammy is fruit
[1605.60 - 1609.68] helps to kill off your pathogens it
[1608.72 - 1612.00] helps to get
[1609.68 - 1612.96] rid of the pathogens it helps to clean
[1612.00 - 1616.32] and cleanse
[1612.96 - 1618.48] the liver it cleans up these things the
[1616.32 - 1620.72] pathogen the bug toxins and you
[1618.48 - 1621.92] end up in a better place when you're
[1620.72 - 1623.84] doing the right stuff but what can
[1621.92 - 1625.52] happen is so many people
[1623.84 - 1627.52] they're so filled with all kinds of bugs
[1625.52 - 1629.04] and toxins that the minute you start
[1627.52 - 1630.88] cleaning that up a little bit
[1629.04 - 1632.48] the minute you start bringing in those
[1630.88 - 1634.00] frozen wild blueberries
[1632.48 - 1635.68] and you start bringing in those bananas
[1634.00 - 1637.68] you start bringing in that and that
[1635.68 - 1639.36] leafy greens and more lettuce and you
[1637.68 - 1641.04] start bringing in that cilantro and that
[1639.36 - 1642.16] mosh and that kale or whatever it is
[1641.04 - 1643.76] that spinach
[1642.16 - 1645.28] and you start bringing all that in
[1643.76 - 1647.60] you're going to be sweeping stuff
[1645.28 - 1648.40] out of the intestinal tract lining
[1647.60 - 1651.12] people have
[1648.40 - 1652.00] rancid fats and rancid proteins for
[1651.12 - 1654.16] years
[1652.00 - 1655.84] sitting on the inside of the linings of
[1654.16 - 1658.96] their intestinal tract
[1655.84 - 1660.56] and in that in that mess that's inside
[1658.96 - 1662.16] the lining of the intestinal tract it's
[1660.56 - 1664.32] been there for years okay
[1662.16 - 1665.52] there's a lot of different kinds of bugs
[1664.32 - 1667.20] and it's sitting in there
[1665.52 - 1669.04] and the minute you start you and it
[1667.20 - 1670.88] gives you symptoms all these things give
[1669.04 - 1672.64] you symptoms but then you start to clean
[1670.88 - 1673.28] up and you start to heal and push that
[1672.64 - 1675.28] stuff out
[1673.28 - 1677.12] you start to wash all that stuff out of
[1675.28 - 1679.44] you with the celery juice
[1677.12 - 1682.48] you start to push all that stuff out of
[1679.44 - 1684.24] you to get it out of your system and and
[1682.48 - 1685.84] when you do that you might feel similar
[1684.24 - 1687.04] symptoms the same symptom a little bit
[1685.84 - 1688.64] you're like wait a minute
[1687.04 - 1690.40] that was the dizziness i had the other
[1688.64 - 1690.80] day i have it today is it because i just
[1690.40 - 1693.28] had
[1690.80 - 1694.08] a leafy green and you know we end up
[1693.28 - 1697.12] running from
[1694.08 - 1699.44] foods to avoid ex
[1697.12 - 1701.12] experiencing something that might be
[1699.44 - 1703.44] slightly uncomfortable
[1701.12 - 1704.80] instead of solving the problem you see
[1703.44 - 1708.08] how important this is
[1704.80 - 1710.40] you know so it's a temporary band-aid
[1708.08 - 1712.00] to keep on minimizing foods minimizing
[1710.40 - 1713.20] foods minimizing foods because medical
[1712.00 - 1714.16] medium information brought all these
[1713.20 - 1716.56] foods back
[1714.16 - 1718.32] this was going on for years stay away
[1716.56 - 1719.92] from fruit stay away from oxalates
[1718.32 - 1721.20] stay away from this stay away from that
[1719.92 - 1722.64] stay away from night shades medical
[1721.20 - 1725.12] medium information you guys
[1722.64 - 1726.00] brought back nightshades brought back
[1725.12 - 1728.40] the fruits
[1726.00 - 1730.08] brought back the leafy greens brought
[1728.40 - 1731.60] back all this stuff nobody even ate
[1730.08 - 1734.64] leafy greens brought all this
[1731.60 - 1736.72] in so you can have all these choices to
[1734.64 - 1738.72] plug into your animal protein diet or
[1736.72 - 1741.36] your plant-based diet
[1738.72 - 1743.12] that's the difference and no one else is
[1741.36 - 1744.32] doing that and that's the problem so you
[1743.12 - 1745.92] got these food wars
[1744.32 - 1747.60] everybody just takes a side of the aisle
[1745.92 - 1749.12] nobody knows why anybody's sick
[1747.60 - 1750.72] nobody knows why people are struggling
[1749.12 - 1752.00] with a symptom condition and they're all
[1750.72 - 1754.64] throwing pot shots
[1752.00 - 1756.16] and theories and and and on those
[1754.64 - 1757.28] theories it's back to fructose
[1756.16 - 1760.80] intolerance
[1757.28 - 1763.12] oxalates oxalic acid
[1760.80 - 1764.72] salicylic acid i mean you can go on
[1763.12 - 1766.24] there's so many of them i'm probably not
[1764.72 - 1768.56] even mentioning right now
[1766.24 - 1770.24] so that's how it works so ironically all
[1768.56 - 1771.76] diet belief systems end up like
[1770.24 - 1774.56] band-aids too
[1771.76 - 1776.48] unless you know what to really avoid
[1774.56 - 1778.48] because you know what's wrong
[1776.48 - 1780.96] i've said this over and over again you
[1778.48 - 1782.72] have to know what's causing your symptom
[1780.96 - 1785.04] or you're just doing a band-aid all the
[1782.72 - 1785.84] time you go plant-based that's not an
[1785.04 - 1787.36] answer
[1785.84 - 1789.28] unless you know what's causing your
[1787.36 - 1790.80] symptom if you know what's causing your
[1789.28 - 1792.56] symptom
[1790.80 - 1794.00] then you can actually live on your
[1792.56 - 1796.96] plant-based diet get
[1794.00 - 1798.00] symptom-free and heal and if you if you
[1796.96 - 1800.96] know your symptom
[1798.00 - 1802.96] on an animal-based diet of any kind you
[1800.96 - 1803.52] once you learn your scent with your
[1802.96 - 1805.60] symptoms
[1803.52 - 1807.84] causing your symptom you can work on
[1805.60 - 1808.24] healing and then you can work with that
[1807.84 - 1810.56] it's
[1808.24 - 1811.52] using the right tools but here's what's
[1810.56 - 1813.28] happening
[1811.52 - 1815.12] everybody's picking the diet belief
[1813.28 - 1816.08] system nobody knows why anybody's sick
[1815.12 - 1818.24] out there
[1816.08 - 1820.56] i mean come on and then the theories
[1818.24 - 1823.04] start throwing around everywhere
[1820.56 - 1824.32] but as the carnivore diet goes you get
[1823.04 - 1826.56] so squeezed down
[1824.32 - 1828.40] and you eliminate every single thing
[1826.56 - 1829.84] possible because you're feeling an
[1828.40 - 1832.64] uncomfortable experience
[1829.84 - 1834.08] from eating a piece of fruit possibly or
[1832.64 - 1836.32] eating a leafy green
[1834.08 - 1838.32] because it's actually cleaning up the
[1836.32 - 1839.68] very crap in your system that's giving
[1838.32 - 1841.12] you the symptoms to begin with
[1839.68 - 1843.36] but what you're doing is you're doing a
[1841.12 - 1845.12] temporary band-aid by pushing all that
[1843.36 - 1846.96] stuff away
[1845.12 - 1848.56] so that you don't feel it and you get
[1846.96 - 1850.72] pushed and squeezed into a corner
[1848.56 - 1852.48] and now you're just eating meat alone
[1850.72 - 1854.72] but in the end that's just a temporary
[1852.48 - 1857.76] band-aid you have to remember that
[1854.72 - 1859.04] and and you know and and remember you
[1857.76 - 1861.68] had these symptoms
[1859.04 - 1862.32] to begin with so these symptoms begin
[1861.68 - 1864.80] with oh
[1862.32 - 1865.60] end up coming back one way or another
[1864.80 - 1867.12] and
[1865.60 - 1868.96] one way or another they'll find their
[1867.12 - 1870.56] way there temporarily the meat that
[1868.96 - 1872.64] you're just stuck on only mono eating
[1870.56 - 1874.80] won't feed the bugs in the moment
[1872.64 - 1876.80] but what happens over time you'll lead
[1874.80 - 1877.60] to deficiencies your immune system drops
[1876.80 - 1880.40] down because
[1877.60 - 1881.68] there's not enough stuff in meat by
[1880.40 - 1883.92] itself
[1881.68 - 1884.72] to keep you going there's just not
[1883.92 - 1886.64] enough and
[1884.72 - 1888.24] and i'm a pro meat guy i'm a pro
[1886.64 - 1889.84] plant-based guy there's not enough
[1888.24 - 1892.00] antioxidants to stop you from
[1889.84 - 1893.76] aging and just meet by itself so you can
[1892.00 - 1894.80] do it temporarily the carnivore thing
[1893.76 - 1896.40] temporarily
[1894.80 - 1898.40] but you'll end up getting deficient
[1896.40 - 1900.96] you'll end up you know weighing too much
[1898.40 - 1902.56] down on the liver the kidneys the heart
[1900.96 - 1903.52] because too much protein and fat
[1902.56 - 1905.92] constantly
[1903.52 - 1907.20] and it's not a balanced diet like
[1905.92 - 1908.40] everybody's always saying or you want a
[1907.20 - 1910.24] balanced diet or you want a balanced
[1908.40 - 1911.44] diet oh yeah this isn't a balanced diet
[1910.24 - 1914.56] but i get it i get it
[1911.44 - 1916.08] we get scared and we get pushed
[1914.56 - 1918.24] into elimination you might be like
[1916.08 - 1919.20] anthony i'm not on a carnivore diet what
[1918.24 - 1920.40] are you talking about
[1919.20 - 1921.76] well wait a minute are you on a
[1920.40 - 1922.32] plant-based diet of all kinds of
[1921.76 - 1923.68] different
[1922.32 - 1925.20] things well you must be avoiding
[1923.68 - 1925.60] something you already squeezed yourself
[1925.20 - 1927.12] back
[1925.60 - 1928.32] you had to get rid of gluten you're on
[1927.12 - 1929.76] plant-based diet you had to get rid of
[1928.32 - 1931.76] some of the grains probably
[1929.76 - 1933.20] maybe you're on a keto animal protein
[1931.76 - 1934.80] diet you got rid of something that
[1933.20 - 1936.32] you're not eating anymore right
[1934.80 - 1937.84] you clean up something no processed
[1936.32 - 1938.40] foods you're getting squeezed a little
[1937.84 - 1940.40] bit
[1938.40 - 1942.56] and a little bit but you got to learn
[1940.40 - 1944.56] what's causing you the problems which
[1942.56 - 1945.68] got you there in the first place to even
[1944.56 - 1947.68] want to eat right
[1945.68 - 1949.52] to even want to eat good to even want to
[1947.68 - 1950.32] care you have to know what's causing
[1949.52 - 1952.64] that
[1950.32 - 1954.00] so you can even get to that point so so
[1952.64 - 1956.16] let's go let's keep on talking because
[1954.00 - 1959.20] we've got a lot to cover
[1956.16 - 1961.76] you want to be free of symptoms and
[1959.20 - 1964.80] conditions that are making you
[1961.76 - 1966.80] suffer and you know it's so
[1964.80 - 1969.04] important to know and and so anyway
[1966.80 - 1971.68] let's let's keep on moving on
[1969.04 - 1973.28] for sure look everybody would love to
[1971.68 - 1974.56] have their buffalo chicken wings
[1973.28 - 1975.84] everybody would love to have their ice
[1974.56 - 1976.72] cream everybody would love to have their
[1975.84 - 1978.40] bread and butter
[1976.72 - 1979.76] their donuts everybody would love to
[1978.40 - 1980.88] have their cookies everybody would love
[1979.76 - 1982.40] to have their cakes
[1980.88 - 1984.40] everybody would love to have their pizza
[1982.40 - 1987.36] every night or every other night come on
[1984.40 - 1989.36] you know everybody would love that but
[1987.36 - 1990.72] reason why we get squeezed out of that
[1989.36 - 1992.08] because we got symptoms and we don't
[1990.72 - 1994.00] know what's causing them if you want to
[1992.08 - 1995.76] know what's causing some symptoms
[1994.00 - 1997.28] take a look at this book get it free at
[1995.76 - 1998.88] the library if you need to get it
[1997.28 - 2000.40] on sale at amazon which is incredible
[1998.88 - 2000.96] the sale they got going for this book
[2000.40 - 2003.44] right now
[2000.96 - 2005.20] let's talk about lectins let's go into
[2003.44 - 2005.84] lectins a little bit really important
[2005.20 - 2008.48] area
[2005.84 - 2009.28] so lengthens is really funny okay over
[2008.48 - 2011.76] the years
[2009.28 - 2014.32] i've witnessed tens of thousands of
[2011.76 - 2017.44] people get their lives back
[2014.32 - 2020.88] i witnessed people healing before
[2017.44 - 2024.32] my eyes i witness people
[2020.88 - 2026.88] now healing before my eyes
[2024.32 - 2028.08] more people have healed their symptoms
[2026.88 - 2030.08] and conditions
[2028.08 - 2032.16] by learning the truth with the medical
[2030.08 - 2035.44] medium book series around this world
[2032.16 - 2036.40] than in any other book or place or venue
[2035.44 - 2039.20] or anything
[2036.40 - 2039.92] okay and i've witnessed this throughout
[2039.20 - 2042.32] the years
[2039.92 - 2043.52] and witnessing it now and it has nothing
[2042.32 - 2047.36] to do with lectins
[2043.52 - 2048.08] okay interesting countless people
[2047.36 - 2050.24] healing
[2048.08 - 2052.40] millions of books around the world
[2050.24 - 2054.48] because of grassroots healing
[2052.40 - 2056.80] not because of pr and marketing nothing
[2054.48 - 2059.44] like that no money behind it
[2056.80 - 2060.16] and people healing and telling somebody
[2059.44 - 2063.20] else about
[2060.16 - 2065.60] these books okay and healing and it has
[2063.20 - 2066.64] nothing to do with concerns about
[2065.60 - 2068.96] lectins
[2066.64 - 2070.00] interesting you know it's helped
[2068.96 - 2072.56] countless
[2070.00 - 2073.92] lives before even the publications of
[2072.56 - 2076.32] these books because i worked with
[2073.92 - 2079.36] thousands of people before these books
[2076.32 - 2082.48] and i witnessed them heal before anybody
[2079.36 - 2083.04] knew of the word lectin okay very
[2082.48 - 2085.76] important
[2083.04 - 2086.84] but for some reason some reason the
[2085.76 - 2090.16] lectin
[2086.84 - 2091.28] leaders didn't know they missed that
[2090.16 - 2093.44] memo
[2091.28 - 2095.04] they missed the memo that countless
[2093.44 - 2095.68] people have healed from medical medium
[2095.04 - 2098.24] books
[2095.68 - 2099.20] tens of thousands of stories you can see
[2098.24 - 2100.88] out there
[2099.20 - 2102.40] thousands of people have seen over the
[2100.88 - 2104.16] years and
[2102.40 - 2105.68] the reports coming back of how many
[2104.16 - 2108.24] people are healing
[2105.68 - 2109.44] hmm without anything to do with lectins
[2108.24 - 2111.52] interesting right
[2109.44 - 2112.48] but electing leaders of lectin
[2111.52 - 2114.56] theory-based
[2112.48 - 2116.48] leaders seem to just miss that memo
[2114.56 - 2117.52] there because they think everything's a
[2116.48 - 2120.32] lectin problem
[2117.52 - 2122.16] oh that's interesting it's not you know
[2120.32 - 2123.92] lectins is one of those things that's so
[2122.16 - 2125.20] silly because lectins aren't responsible
[2123.92 - 2126.16] for digestive issues they're not
[2125.20 - 2127.92] responsible for
[2126.16 - 2130.72] digestion problems they're not
[2127.92 - 2132.88] responsible because it's not lectins
[2130.72 - 2134.16] that cause a problem it's not lectins
[2132.88 - 2135.84] and fruits it's not lectins and
[2134.16 - 2137.04] vegetables it's not lectins
[2135.84 - 2139.20] and all this stuff it's one of the
[2137.04 - 2139.44] stupider theories it's actually one of
[2139.20 - 2141.36] the
[2139.44 - 2143.60] it's actually one of the stupidest
[2141.36 - 2145.84] theories of all the theories
[2143.60 - 2148.08] that's the irony to it and i don't care
[2145.84 - 2149.52] who i get upset or not or what not it's
[2148.08 - 2151.20] tell you guys the truth
[2149.52 - 2152.88] or don't tell you the truth what is it
[2151.20 - 2153.68] gonna be you know what i mean that's why
[2152.88 - 2155.36] i've always
[2153.68 - 2158.00] always always been like i'll say it like
[2155.36 - 2159.60] it is and you know and it's it's funny
[2158.00 - 2161.68] on another note anything i've done in
[2159.60 - 2162.96] media or anything else they they edit
[2161.68 - 2165.20] every single thing
[2162.96 - 2167.04] i say practically because i say it like
[2165.20 - 2169.20] it is like this all the time
[2167.04 - 2171.28] but the bottom line is it's about the
[2169.20 - 2172.48] pathogens it's about certain toxins
[2171.28 - 2176.00] that's why we're sick
[2172.48 - 2178.80] it's not about the lectins critical
[2176.00 - 2180.00] to know and that's these theories are
[2178.80 - 2182.96] ridiculous and it'll
[2180.00 - 2184.08] that will squeeze you you'll get lectin
[2182.96 - 2186.96] screwed
[2184.08 - 2187.60] okay and then that will it will squeeze
[2186.96 - 2190.40] you
[2187.60 - 2192.24] and squeeze you off and then you're now
[2190.40 - 2194.40] now you're in that mindset
[2192.24 - 2196.08] it's unbelievable what can happen all
[2194.40 - 2196.56] right so let's go into oxalates a little
[2196.08 - 2199.20] bit
[2196.56 - 2199.20] okay so
[2199.68 - 2203.84] patricia says we love you they know i
[2201.28 - 2205.68] love you too you guys are amazing
[2203.84 - 2207.68] julie you just did one day at advanced
[2205.68 - 2209.52] 369 you already did you did your first
[2207.68 - 2212.40] day of advanced 369.
[2209.52 - 2214.08] incredible advance 369 is really getting
[2212.40 - 2215.44] people like to a place like an
[2214.08 - 2216.56] unbelievable place
[2215.44 - 2218.48] if you guys don't know about the
[2216.56 - 2220.16] advanced 369 get the book that's my
[2218.48 - 2222.56] recommendation
[2220.16 - 2225.12] carol says since doing your suggestions
[2222.56 - 2228.48] i can walk again for miles a day
[2225.12 - 2229.68] oh my god i love knowing you can walk
[2228.48 - 2232.00] again for miles
[2229.68 - 2233.52] oh my god but i can't eat very many
[2232.00 - 2234.32] forgot the rest of the question it went
[2233.52 - 2236.48] up already
[2234.32 - 2238.00] but you can walk a day for miles
[2236.48 - 2239.36] incredible
[2238.00 - 2242.32] and that's so good to know let's talk
[2239.36 - 2244.08] about oxalates a little bit um
[2242.32 - 2245.84] had amazing results i missed that
[2244.08 - 2248.00] question too just the quest
[2245.84 - 2250.24] the questions are cranking up had
[2248.00 - 2251.52] amazing results on two weeks potato mono
[2250.24 - 2254.96] eating cleanse
[2251.52 - 2258.48] so joanna the mono eating cleanses
[2254.96 - 2261.44] incredible guess what if you got scared
[2258.48 - 2263.20] off about nightshades which is
[2261.44 - 2264.00] ridiculous that's actually a theory
[2263.20 - 2265.76] that's not
[2264.00 - 2268.16] accurate on any level with no evidence
[2265.76 - 2270.32] behind it if you ever get scared off
[2268.16 - 2272.08] about nightshades like potato being
[2270.32 - 2274.40] afraid of a potato
[2272.08 - 2275.20] you lose your chance to heal and that's
[2274.40 - 2277.28] what happens
[2275.20 - 2279.36] that's what i'm talking about the belief
[2277.28 - 2280.08] systems not just the diet belief systems
[2279.36 - 2283.04] but the bad
[2280.08 - 2284.72] theories they stop people from healing
[2283.04 - 2287.68] and that's the difference between the mm
[2284.72 - 2288.72] information and so i'm so proud of you
[2287.68 - 2292.08] i'm so proud of you
[2288.72 - 2294.08] um you you know with celery juice
[2292.08 - 2296.16] and and different in a different mono
[2294.08 - 2297.76] cleanse anybody can choose too they can
[2296.16 - 2299.36] choose a different model cleanses and
[2297.76 - 2301.20] the celery juice with it the amount
[2299.36 - 2302.64] you can just move forward so i'm proud
[2301.20 - 2304.56] of you proud of you
[2302.64 - 2305.84] so there's oxalates in everything let's
[2304.56 - 2307.68] talk about oxalates
[2305.84 - 2309.52] everybody's like spinach high in
[2307.68 - 2313.04] oxalates something else
[2309.52 - 2316.48] high in oxalates oxalates oxalates and
[2313.04 - 2319.20] you'll hear this okay another another
[2316.48 - 2319.68] like mental trick another mental trick
[2319.20 - 2322.24] from
[2319.68 - 2323.12] from the industries and alternative
[2322.24 - 2324.72] industry
[2323.12 - 2326.40] not knowing what's causing your symptom
[2324.72 - 2328.16] or condition it's so
[2326.40 - 2330.24] sad okay so let's go into this a little
[2328.16 - 2333.20] bit first of all
[2330.24 - 2333.52] oxalates are in everything every single
[2333.20 - 2335.36] thing
[2333.52 - 2336.72] they're in meat how come nobody's
[2335.36 - 2338.40] complaining about that
[2336.72 - 2340.96] how come nobody's talking about oxalates
[2338.40 - 2344.08] and meat right
[2340.96 - 2345.76] they're always picking on spinach
[2344.08 - 2348.00] they're always picking on a fruit a
[2345.76 - 2350.56] berry they're always picking on an
[2348.00 - 2352.96] apple they're always picking on a plum
[2350.56 - 2354.40] um they're always picking on a pear
[2352.96 - 2355.84] let's see what else they pick on oh
[2354.40 - 2357.20] vegetables pick on all of all the
[2355.84 - 2358.00] vegetables oxalates and all the
[2357.20 - 2361.12] vegetables
[2358.00 - 2363.04] but there's oxalate in meat cheese eggs
[2361.12 - 2365.60] dairy products there's oxalates in
[2363.04 - 2366.56] butter there's oxalates in every human
[2365.60 - 2369.76] being
[2366.56 - 2370.48] we're loaded with oxalates animals we
[2369.76 - 2374.08] eat
[2370.48 - 2377.68] are loaded with oxalates okay
[2374.08 - 2381.20] oxalates are in everything everywhere
[2377.68 - 2384.00] talk about a total total trick
[2381.20 - 2385.76] played on everybody it's unbelievable
[2384.00 - 2387.28] well wait a minute wait a minute i react
[2385.76 - 2387.84] to an oxalate how do you really know
[2387.28 - 2390.32] you're
[2387.84 - 2392.08] ever reacting to an oxalate the only way
[2390.32 - 2395.04] you could ever know or ever find out
[2392.08 - 2396.88] is if they separate the oxalate and make
[2395.04 - 2399.36] a pill out of it
[2396.88 - 2400.48] filled with oxalates and they give you
[2399.36 - 2403.76] that pill
[2400.48 - 2407.20] that's loaded with oxalates okay
[2403.76 - 2410.00] and they and you just or you drink a a
[2407.20 - 2411.04] glass of oxalates it's the only way
[2410.00 - 2412.48] you'll ever know
[2411.04 - 2414.32] so somebody be like well i react to
[2412.48 - 2416.08] oxalates you know i had
[2414.32 - 2417.68] this apple where i had this wait a
[2416.08 - 2419.12] minute how do you know you're not
[2417.68 - 2420.16] reacting from the food you ate the night
[2419.12 - 2422.56] before
[2420.16 - 2424.32] that wasn't that wasn't an apple how do
[2422.56 - 2427.52] you know you're not reacting to
[2424.32 - 2429.52] the body cleaning out some toxins bug
[2427.52 - 2431.28] toxins and toxins of different kinds
[2429.52 - 2433.12] how do you know you're not reacting to
[2431.28 - 2434.32] that how do you know you're not reacting
[2433.12 - 2437.12] to something else like
[2434.32 - 2437.60] what about plug-in air fresheners what
[2437.12 - 2438.96] about
[2437.60 - 2441.12] all kinds of other things that are
[2438.96 - 2442.96] happening what about scented candles
[2441.12 - 2444.48] what about somebody's cologne i've seen
[2442.96 - 2447.76] somebody's cologne
[2444.48 - 2449.84] make somebody sensitive sick in an hour
[2447.76 - 2451.20] where they're literally just on a couch
[2449.84 - 2453.20] with a splitting migraine because they
[2451.20 - 2455.52] were breathing in somebody's cologne
[2453.20 - 2457.44] you know maybe you're just reacting to
[2455.52 - 2458.40] the bug poisons that were flushing out
[2457.44 - 2460.16] of your liver
[2458.40 - 2462.16] when you eat a cleansing food for the
[2460.16 - 2463.68] first time in a long time
[2462.16 - 2465.76] you know you don't know and so what
[2463.68 - 2466.88] happens is the ultimate trick the ox
[2465.76 - 2468.72] lake game
[2466.88 - 2470.80] is one of the ultimate tricks of all
[2468.72 - 2473.28] time and it really
[2470.80 - 2474.88] just sucks it does you know you and and
[2473.28 - 2476.08] if you have symptoms already
[2474.88 - 2477.84] they're going to come and go no matter
[2476.08 - 2478.64] what until you actually go to the root
[2477.84 - 2480.00] cause
[2478.64 - 2481.76] so until you actually go to the root
[2480.00 - 2484.72] cause of your symptoms and conditions
[2481.76 - 2485.52] and you know what's causing them can you
[2484.72 - 2487.68] actually
[2485.52 - 2489.12] like even understand and that's the
[2487.68 - 2491.28] whole thing that's really hard for
[2489.12 - 2494.08] people look
[2491.28 - 2495.92] it's a guessing game saga over and over
[2494.08 - 2497.28] and oxalates are involved in that and
[2495.92 - 2498.96] let me tell you something interesting
[2497.28 - 2500.08] there's antioxidants in all fruits and
[2498.96 - 2502.40] vegetables
[2500.08 - 2503.52] that cancel out oxalates that's another
[2502.40 - 2506.48] thing too
[2503.52 - 2508.08] so what about that whole thing um lisa
[2506.48 - 2508.80] said maybe you're allergic to celery
[2508.08 - 2511.20] question mark
[2508.80 - 2511.92] all our bodies are different uh thus
[2511.20 - 2514.00] some
[2511.92 - 2515.52] allergic to one food herb item and
[2514.00 - 2517.84] others not just a thought
[2515.52 - 2518.64] well lisa is that how it works it's a
[2517.84 - 2520.48] good question though
[2518.64 - 2521.76] i mean no i'm really glad you brought
[2520.48 - 2524.80] that up it
[2521.76 - 2525.92] everybody is different 100 so different
[2524.80 - 2527.28] it's unbelievable
[2525.92 - 2528.48] someone else has more mercury in their
[2527.28 - 2529.60] brain causing their anxiety than
[2528.48 - 2531.04] somebody else does
[2529.60 - 2532.48] somebody else has more aluminum in their
[2531.04 - 2534.00] body causing their vitiligo than
[2532.48 - 2535.92] somebody else does
[2534.00 - 2536.96] somebody else has way more copper inside
[2535.92 - 2538.72] their liver that's causing their
[2536.96 - 2541.28] excellent psoriasis
[2538.72 - 2542.64] than than somebody else does somebody
[2541.28 - 2544.88] has more streptococcus
[2542.64 - 2546.08] causing their acne to keep on blowing up
[2544.88 - 2547.84] left and right
[2546.08 - 2549.76] so when they have a little bit of gluten
[2547.84 - 2551.60] their streptococcus feeds off the gluten
[2549.76 - 2552.88] and their acne is just exploding
[2551.60 - 2554.80] somebody else might have two different
[2552.88 - 2556.08] types of streptococcus somebody might
[2554.80 - 2557.52] have two varieties of epstein-barr
[2556.08 - 2560.32] causing chronic fatigue syndrome
[2557.52 - 2561.44] and something else and lupus somebody
[2560.32 - 2563.20] might have
[2561.44 - 2564.48] more metals on one side of the brain
[2563.20 - 2565.84] more metals on the other side of the
[2564.48 - 2566.40] brain less metals on the other side of
[2565.84 - 2567.68] the brain
[2566.40 - 2569.76] somebody might have shingles causing
[2567.68 - 2572.24] trigeminal neuralgia somebody might have
[2569.76 - 2573.84] epstein-barr causing their glaucoma
[2572.24 - 2575.60] and this is why we're all different
[2573.84 - 2576.64] every last bit of us
[2575.60 - 2578.40] and we're different with different
[2576.64 - 2580.00] varieties of bugs different mutations
[2578.40 - 2580.56] different strains how many different
[2580.00 - 2582.40] kinds
[2580.56 - 2584.00] different relationships different places
[2582.40 - 2585.28] we get them from public bathrooms
[2584.00 - 2587.76] different places we get from different
[2585.28 - 2589.20] restaurants everybody's different
[2587.76 - 2590.32] people have more battles in them people
[2589.20 - 2591.28] have more bugs in them people have
[2590.32 - 2593.20] different toxins
[2591.28 - 2594.80] i know somebody who's drenched in
[2593.20 - 2596.16] gasoline
[2594.80 - 2597.68] and they're going to be different from
[2596.16 - 2599.36] here on out because they were drenched
[2597.68 - 2600.80] in gasoline than everybody else
[2599.36 - 2603.12] because they have gasoline inside their
[2600.80 - 2605.84] liver and inside their bodies and organ
[2603.12 - 2608.00] organs in their body and organs and they
[2605.84 - 2610.00] have gasoline all through them
[2608.00 - 2611.60] and everybody's different for all these
[2610.00 - 2613.20] reasons and then
[2611.60 - 2614.64] we're different from how our nervous
[2613.20 - 2616.08] system is with it all with how many
[2614.64 - 2618.48] neurotoxins everything else
[2616.08 - 2620.08] so dale said how do you put how do you
[2618.48 - 2623.60] how do you figure out your root
[2620.08 - 2626.72] cause well okay go to the library
[2623.60 - 2628.72] okay get the book out for free
[2626.72 - 2630.48] get the book out for free and start
[2628.72 - 2632.24] learning what the root causes are
[2630.48 - 2634.00] so dale start learning what they are you
[2632.24 - 2634.48] can figure it out get get the book out
[2634.00 - 2636.72] for free
[2634.48 - 2638.08] don't even buy the book it's 16.99 right
[2636.72 - 2639.12] now on amazon but you don't have to buy
[2638.08 - 2640.08] it you can get it for free at the
[2639.12 - 2642.80] labyrinth
[2640.08 - 2645.76] and and and definitely um so oxidate
[2642.80 - 2648.32] okay kidney stones okay julie a theory
[2645.76 - 2650.16] a theory oxalates are in every single
[2648.32 - 2653.92] cell in your body
[2650.16 - 2657.52] they're in every single organ okay
[2653.92 - 2660.56] so so oxalates are everywhere we
[2657.52 - 2665.44] are an oxalate
[2660.56 - 2669.28] it's it's it's we are we are an oxalate
[2665.44 - 2671.84] okay kidney stones that's from the liver
[2669.28 - 2673.92] the liver getting stagnant and sluggish
[2671.84 - 2676.16] and that's from the intestinal tract
[2673.92 - 2676.96] getting getting caked on putrified
[2676.16 - 2678.72] proteins
[2676.96 - 2681.12] lining up the lines of the intestinal
[2678.72 - 2682.72] tract rancid fats lining up the linings
[2681.12 - 2685.04] of the intestinal tract all
[2682.72 - 2686.72] all running through okay it's from a
[2685.04 - 2690.40] burden of protein
[2686.72 - 2693.04] too over protein we are the society
[2690.40 - 2694.72] or the or the human race just kills
[2693.04 - 2696.64] itself with protein
[2694.72 - 2698.00] if you're thinking hey sounds like he's
[2696.64 - 2700.24] plant-based
[2698.00 - 2701.84] no plant-based people will kill
[2700.24 - 2705.92] themselves the protein
[2701.84 - 2707.84] they'll tank the nuts tank the seeds
[2705.92 - 2708.96] they'll tank the protein powders and the
[2707.84 - 2710.64] protein shakes
[2708.96 - 2712.48] they'll kill themselves of protein too
[2710.64 - 2715.92] and they'll create kidney stones
[2712.48 - 2718.08] um hi franco
[2715.92 - 2719.52] i'm not sure if i should commit sorry
[2718.08 - 2721.12] i'm not sure if i should comment because
[2719.52 - 2722.88] i don't know
[2721.12 - 2724.96] if you see them from whichever feed
[2722.88 - 2728.24] you're looking at on your screen
[2724.96 - 2731.04] oh hi franco hey you know but just look
[2728.24 - 2732.32] you commented there for sure i'm on the
[2731.04 - 2735.76] feed right now
[2732.32 - 2736.48] watching the feed um it's great having
[2735.76 - 2739.68] you guys here
[2736.48 - 2741.28] so we don't know why we're sick you guys
[2739.68 - 2744.40] that's the problem
[2741.28 - 2746.00] so we get you know we get to a point now
[2744.40 - 2747.52] where we end up with okay let's talk
[2746.00 - 2749.28] about fructose intolerance
[2747.52 - 2751.36] that's a whole other thing too let's go
[2749.28 - 2754.24] there first of all
[2751.36 - 2755.68] who ate that much fruit i know going
[2754.24 - 2757.92] through the years every single person i
[2755.68 - 2759.60] talked to that came to me who was sick
[2757.92 - 2761.68] every person i've ever talked to every
[2759.60 - 2764.56] person a doctor called me up and wanted
[2761.68 - 2766.88] to ask about wasn't eating fruit
[2764.56 - 2769.04] ever thousands of doctors have contacted
[2766.88 - 2770.80] me over the years and still do
[2769.04 - 2773.68] and they want advice about their
[2770.80 - 2774.24] patients so i spend a lot of time you
[2773.68 - 2776.48] guys
[2774.24 - 2777.36] talking to doctors every day that's what
[2776.48 - 2779.20] i do now
[2777.36 - 2780.64] in between writing the books in between
[2779.20 - 2782.32] trying to do all these this free
[2780.64 - 2784.24] information i'm dumping out on you just
[2782.32 - 2786.80] to free information all the time
[2784.24 - 2788.16] and i talk to doctors all the time every
[2786.80 - 2790.40] single day
[2788.16 - 2792.16] and they'll ask me about patience and
[2790.40 - 2794.00] you know and they'll say they'll say
[2792.16 - 2795.76] you know and what happens is they're not
[2794.00 - 2797.52] eating fruit
[2795.76 - 2799.04] and but they're sick and they come in
[2797.52 - 2802.08] sick who eats that much fruit
[2799.04 - 2804.24] so the fructose intolerance
[2802.08 - 2805.20] the the fructose intolerance thing is
[2804.24 - 2808.32] just really
[2805.20 - 2809.84] a whole it's a mistake all on its own
[2808.32 - 2812.08] in a lot of ways and i'll talk into a
[2809.84 - 2813.60] little bit let's talk about it first of
[2812.08 - 2815.52] all one of the reasons why people get
[2813.60 - 2816.00] the fructose intolerance tag is because
[2815.52 - 2817.92] they have
[2816.00 - 2820.32] insulin resistance but they have insulin
[2817.92 - 2822.16] resistance on all sugar
[2820.32 - 2824.24] they get insulin resistance on cane
[2822.16 - 2828.08] sugar insulin resistance on
[2824.24 - 2831.28] maple syrup insulin resistance on um
[2828.08 - 2834.88] starchy vegetables insulin resistance on
[2831.28 - 2837.52] raw honey or honey sugar cubes anything
[2834.88 - 2838.24] they have insulin resistance you know
[2837.52 - 2840.08] meanwhile
[2838.24 - 2841.36] they're not going to say that they're
[2840.08 - 2843.92] cane sugar
[2841.36 - 2844.40] intolerant they're not going to say
[2843.92 - 2846.64] they're
[2844.40 - 2848.64] you don't hear that too often cane sugar
[2846.64 - 2849.52] intolerant they're not maple syrup
[2848.64 - 2852.56] intolerant
[2849.52 - 2855.76] you don't hear that right they're not
[2852.56 - 2857.36] honey intolerant right
[2855.76 - 2858.96] so you don't hear that that they're not
[2857.36 - 2860.56] honey intolerant okay
[2858.96 - 2862.96] but they'll be picked on the fruit will
[2860.56 - 2866.76] be picked on because the makers
[2862.96 - 2869.84] of the fructose intolerance movement was
[2866.76 - 2873.52] anti-fruit haters
[2869.84 - 2875.76] upon fruit see where the bias comes in
[2873.52 - 2877.28] hmm that's where the bias comes in
[2875.76 - 2879.04] interesting meanwhile
[2877.28 - 2880.72] are you talking about the bloop the two
[2879.04 - 2881.92] blueberries you got in a blueberry
[2880.72 - 2883.52] muffin years ago
[2881.92 - 2885.28] are you talking about the strawberries
[2883.52 - 2888.32] in a strawberry shortcake you had
[2885.28 - 2889.12] were you talking about the fruit pie you
[2888.32 - 2891.68] ate
[2889.12 - 2892.96] out of a package when you were 10 years
[2891.68 - 2894.24] old are you talking about the apple in
[2892.96 - 2895.84] your lunch box
[2894.24 - 2897.36] you talking about the banana you had
[2895.84 - 2900.32] every other day
[2897.36 - 2902.00] like you know what's going on here see
[2900.32 - 2905.92] and and you know it's the whole thing so
[2902.00 - 2908.72] elizabeth um i get breathing problems
[2905.92 - 2911.04] thick air when i eat too much sweet
[2908.72 - 2913.20] fruit or when i eat too much
[2911.04 - 2914.48] okay so when you eat too much this is
[2913.20 - 2916.00] not just a sweet fruit
[2914.48 - 2917.76] or when you eat too much with other
[2916.00 - 2918.24] foods too so elizabeth if you eat too
[2917.76 - 2919.68] much
[2918.24 - 2921.84] you end up having the breathing problems
[2919.68 - 2924.88] okay i've seen that so many times
[2921.84 - 2927.28] no intestinal problems always breathing
[2924.88 - 2929.60] what is that it's better now after
[2927.28 - 2932.00] cleansing and changing the diet
[2929.60 - 2933.84] in celery juice nine months now see it's
[2932.00 - 2935.20] better right and i'll talk about that a
[2933.84 - 2938.16] little bit okay
[2935.20 - 2939.20] and but still have to be careful with
[2938.16 - 2942.64] some fruit
[2939.20 - 2943.36] um or do i just go for it it's not the
[2942.64 - 2945.68] fruit
[2943.36 - 2946.48] that's the problem with that okay it's
[2945.68 - 2950.88] it's what happens
[2946.48 - 2953.68] fruit is very very water rich
[2950.88 - 2954.16] it's very water rich okay and a lot of
[2953.68 - 2956.08] people
[2954.16 - 2957.52] their stomach shrink and they eat small
[2956.08 - 2959.76] amounts of chicken they'll eat
[2957.52 - 2961.36] small amounts of a vegetable a chicken
[2959.76 - 2961.84] or something to eat small amounts of
[2961.36 - 2963.60] food
[2961.84 - 2965.52] and then when you eat fruit it's really
[2963.60 - 2968.24] water rich too that's the one thing too
[2965.52 - 2971.28] so when you have sensitive nerves
[2968.24 - 2973.04] sensitive nerves because originally
[2971.28 - 2975.36] you're dealing with pathogens and you're
[2973.04 - 2977.12] dealing with pathogen toxins and
[2975.36 - 2979.12] inflamed nerves so what i've
[2977.12 - 2980.32] seen with people and i talked to doctors
[2979.12 - 2981.92] and you can talk to your doctor about
[2980.32 - 2983.60] this too this information what i've
[2981.92 - 2984.16] talked to doctors about helping doctors
[2983.60 - 2987.12] with
[2984.16 - 2989.12] is that nerves the vagus nerve gets
[2987.12 - 2990.56] sensitive it gets inflamed because of
[2989.12 - 2994.24] neurotoxins because
[2990.56 - 2996.96] we end up having symptoms these symptoms
[2994.24 - 2998.40] are caused by pathogens pathogens such
[2996.96 - 2999.92] as viruses such as ebv
[2998.40 - 3001.52] and such and those kinds of viruses they
[2999.92 - 3002.40] release neurotoxins in the shingles
[3001.52 - 3004.32] virus and such
[3002.40 - 3005.36] and these neurotoxins inflame the vagus
[3004.32 - 3006.08] and phrenic nerve guess where those
[3005.36 - 3009.04] nerves go
[3006.08 - 3010.64] down your neck dump through the phrenic
[3009.04 - 3012.08] nerve vagus nerve right down to your
[3010.64 - 3014.88] stomach through your chest
[3012.08 - 3015.76] and so what happens is if you fill up
[3014.88 - 3019.20] with too much
[3015.76 - 3020.88] food you can get that can't breathe too
[3019.20 - 3023.36] easy get that tightness of the chest you
[3020.88 - 3026.56] can get that all that because the nerves
[3023.36 - 3029.04] feeling pressure on the nerves so yeah
[3026.56 - 3030.32] you got if you down a whole melon
[3029.04 - 3032.00] you're going to feel that pressure on
[3030.32 - 3033.36] those sensitive nerves but the reason
[3032.00 - 3034.64] why the sensitive nerves are getting
[3033.36 - 3035.92] better and you feel less pressure and
[3034.64 - 3036.56] less pressure and now you're doing so
[3035.92 - 3037.84] much better
[3036.56 - 3039.44] is because you've been cleaning up those
[3037.84 - 3040.24] neurotoxins you can talk to your doctor
[3039.44 - 3042.24] you know say hey
[3040.24 - 3044.32] tell your doctor about this information
[3042.24 - 3047.36] um but it's really
[3044.32 - 3048.96] um yeah so so incredible um
[3047.36 - 3050.88] so i'm really happy about this you know
[3048.96 - 3052.48] so you guys i'm happy about you guys
[3050.88 - 3053.92] being here so much information to talk
[3052.48 - 3054.72] about i'm happy about all the comments
[3053.92 - 3056.32] i'm seeing
[3054.72 - 3058.16] this is so great so let's talk about the
[3056.32 - 3061.76] fructose intolerance a little bit
[3058.16 - 3064.32] so hereditary fructose intolerance hfi
[3061.76 - 3066.08] okay hereditary fructose intolerance
[3064.32 - 3067.60] another theory
[3066.08 - 3070.24] another theory because they don't know
[3067.60 - 3072.24] what's causing symptoms or conditions
[3070.24 - 3073.44] so what happens is when alternative
[3072.24 - 3074.88] science and research doesn't know what
[3073.44 - 3075.92] causes your symptoms and conditions you
[3074.88 - 3079.20] get all these
[3075.92 - 3080.64] bias approaches that develop and these
[3079.20 - 3081.60] bias approaches that don't know why
[3080.64 - 3083.20] we're sick
[3081.60 - 3084.96] and so they'll say well maybe it's the
[3083.20 - 3088.08] aldolase b
[3084.96 - 3089.68] iso enzyme so maybe it's all the lace b
[3088.08 - 3091.84] is enzyme maybe that's it
[3089.68 - 3093.84] maybe people are missing that and that
[3091.84 - 3096.16] needs to be there for fructose funny
[3093.84 - 3097.20] what that doesn't need to be there for
[3096.16 - 3098.96] um
[3097.20 - 3101.12] maple syrup that doesn't need to be
[3098.96 - 3103.36] there for honey that doesn't need to
[3101.12 - 3105.04] first of all no one loses that even if
[3103.36 - 3106.08] someone's low on it they can eat all the
[3105.04 - 3108.64] fruit they want
[3106.08 - 3110.32] how about testing people with who are
[3108.64 - 3111.76] eating all the fruit they want or low at
[3110.32 - 3112.32] i've seen that accidentally happen did
[3111.76 - 3115.36] you know i
[3112.32 - 3116.56] saw i saw that alternative doctors even
[3115.36 - 3117.92] told me but they said hey
[3116.56 - 3119.04] alternative functional medicine doctors
[3117.92 - 3120.40] reach out to me and they said you know
[3119.04 - 3121.68] what i'm into this fructose intolerance
[3120.40 - 3122.96] thing anthony i know you're not
[3121.68 - 3124.96] but let me just tell you something
[3122.96 - 3129.28] interesting that happened and
[3124.96 - 3132.40] they said they said i i tested a patient
[3129.28 - 3134.32] for fructose intolerance okay so i was
[3132.40 - 3137.60] looking at their all the lace b
[3134.32 - 3140.00] to see if it was low and and the patient
[3137.60 - 3141.04] wasn't having any problems with fruit at
[3140.00 - 3143.12] all in fact
[3141.04 - 3144.48] they felt better eating fruit they did
[3143.12 - 3146.16] better when they eat fruit
[3144.48 - 3147.44] in fact they healed while eating fruit
[3146.16 - 3148.80] through the recommendations i gave the
[3147.44 - 3150.96] functional medicine doctor
[3148.80 - 3152.24] for their patients and then the
[3150.96 - 3155.52] functional medicine doctor said
[3152.24 - 3158.64] i decided to run in all the lace b
[3155.52 - 3159.92] test i saw enzyme tests to see if it was
[3158.64 - 3162.48] low
[3159.92 - 3164.08] and it was low but how come they were
[3162.48 - 3165.12] able to eat fruit perfectly fine and it
[3164.08 - 3167.28] got them better
[3165.12 - 3169.12] so because all the latest be iceland's
[3167.28 - 3170.24] on has nothing to do with anything
[3169.12 - 3171.76] there's nothing to do with someone
[3170.24 - 3172.88] eating fruit or not but this is the
[3171.76 - 3175.68] accidents that happen
[3172.88 - 3177.76] these accidents end up cheating people
[3175.68 - 3179.20] so now you're afraid of a piece of fruit
[3177.76 - 3180.88] now you're afraid of a berry
[3179.20 - 3182.80] now you're now you're not getting the
[3180.88 - 3184.56] healing you need now you're not can i
[3182.80 - 3188.00] just tell you something
[3184.56 - 3192.00] you need you need
[3188.00 - 3194.32] to actually be you need to have glucose
[3192.00 - 3197.20] in your body to live
[3194.32 - 3197.68] you need to have sugar in your system we
[3197.20 - 3200.96] can't
[3197.68 - 3203.68] function without it we live
[3200.96 - 3204.64] and breathe because of sugar if you take
[3203.68 - 3208.24] out glucose
[3204.64 - 3211.44] we die okay remove glucose from
[3208.24 - 3211.92] us we lay there and we die did you know
[3211.44 - 3214.00] that
[3211.92 - 3216.00] glucose is critical to every cell in our
[3214.00 - 3217.68] body it's how we build muscles it's how
[3216.00 - 3219.12] we use our muscles that's how we wake up
[3217.68 - 3219.92] in the morning it's how we function it's
[3219.12 - 3223.04] how we think
[3219.92 - 3226.24] it's how we can do things all of it
[3223.04 - 3228.32] and so glucose is critical but what
[3226.24 - 3230.40] here but what the makers of the fructose
[3228.32 - 3233.04] intolerance theory don't know
[3230.40 - 3233.52] is that when your body's filled with all
[3233.04 - 3236.16] this
[3233.52 - 3237.92] fat fat in her liver fattener organs fat
[3236.16 - 3238.88] in our bloodstream fat in our intestinal
[3237.92 - 3240.56] tract lining
[3238.88 - 3241.76] we get a little insulin and insulin
[3240.56 - 3243.52] resistance so then they'll blame
[3241.76 - 3245.28] fructose intolerance on that
[3243.52 - 3247.20] but they'll say fruits doing the insulin
[3245.28 - 3249.12] resistance they won't say maple syrup is
[3247.20 - 3250.72] they won't say honey oh fruit fruits an
[3249.12 - 3252.64] attack on fruit
[3250.72 - 3254.56] but you yes you get a little bit of
[3252.64 - 3255.60] insulin resistance if you fill the fats
[3254.56 - 3257.52] that's the whole point
[3255.60 - 3259.36] when you learn how to get the fats out
[3257.52 - 3261.60] of the liver when you learn how to clean
[3259.36 - 3263.44] the fats out of the body the rancid ones
[3261.60 - 3265.28] when you learn how to lower your fat so
[3263.44 - 3266.32] you can get the glucose you need to
[3265.28 - 3268.56] thrive
[3266.32 - 3270.96] then you just there is no anything like
[3268.56 - 3272.88] the worry about that it's crazy
[3270.96 - 3274.72] and when we're loaded up with pathogens
[3272.88 - 3276.08] when we're loaded with bacteria when
[3274.72 - 3278.72] we're loaded up with
[3276.08 - 3280.96] bugs and bacterial toxins and when our
[3278.72 - 3282.08] liver stagnant and our liver is clogged
[3280.96 - 3284.80] you guys
[3282.08 - 3285.84] and we're loaded up with all that and
[3284.80 - 3288.32] then
[3285.84 - 3289.92] fruit ends up cleaning that out and you
[3288.32 - 3291.12] might get a little bit of reaction you
[3289.92 - 3292.00] might get a little bit of insulin
[3291.12 - 3293.92] resistance
[3292.00 - 3296.08] you might get a little bit of reaction
[3293.92 - 3296.48] because guess what the fruits cleaning
[3296.08 - 3298.64] that
[3296.48 - 3300.24] crap out the crap that's been building
[3298.64 - 3301.60] and you giving you symptoms to begin
[3300.24 - 3302.80] with that ended up at the doctor's
[3301.60 - 3305.28] office anyway
[3302.80 - 3306.24] it's about knowing what the problems are
[3305.28 - 3309.12] instead of getting
[3306.24 - 3310.00] trapped in the theories from hell you
[3309.12 - 3312.00] know i call them
[3310.00 - 3314.16] theories from hell for a reason over the
[3312.00 - 3315.12] years i said great another theory from
[3314.16 - 3317.84] hell
[3315.12 - 3321.76] to take people and make their lives
[3317.84 - 3324.48] miserable let's talk about histamines
[3321.76 - 3326.16] this is good tea by the way some
[3324.48 - 3327.92] peppermint tea
[3326.16 - 3329.92] so oh there's a lot of people they'll
[3327.92 - 3331.04] get told they're sensitive to peppermint
[3329.92 - 3331.52] are they allergic to peppermint they
[3331.04 - 3333.04] shouldn't
[3331.52 - 3335.12] have peppermint it's like are you
[3333.04 - 3337.52] kidding i'm not talking about peppermint
[3335.12 - 3340.08] candies here i'm talking about
[3337.52 - 3341.60] peppermint tea incredible for you so the
[3340.08 - 3342.96] but let's talk about histamines a little
[3341.60 - 3346.24] bit so histamines
[3342.96 - 3348.48] people think food creates
[3346.24 - 3350.64] they're the cause of histamines they're
[3348.48 - 3354.16] the cause of histamine reactions
[3350.64 - 3355.92] okay it's not foods causing histamine
[3354.16 - 3357.28] reactions what about the 90 year old
[3355.92 - 3358.80] what about the 70 year old what about
[3357.28 - 3360.24] the 80 year old who doesn't have any
[3358.80 - 3361.52] histamine reactions and they can eat
[3360.24 - 3363.68] everything under the sun
[3361.52 - 3366.64] danielle i eat loads of fruit and i have
[3363.68 - 3368.08] diabetes type one yet i'm on such a low
[3366.64 - 3371.84] dose of insulin
[3368.08 - 3374.64] danielle exactly and then if you
[3371.84 - 3375.04] if you bring in all these fats you'll
[3374.64 - 3376.64] you'll
[3375.04 - 3378.16] you'll need more insulin you'll get the
[3376.64 - 3380.56] insulin resistance
[3378.16 - 3381.44] incredible brilliant you're eating a lot
[3380.56 - 3384.96] of fruits
[3381.44 - 3388.00] exactly fruits get rid of
[3384.96 - 3390.24] diabetes over time they knock down those
[3388.00 - 3394.40] numbers for type 1 they get rid of type
[3390.24 - 3397.20] 2 insulin resistance hypoglycemia
[3394.40 - 3399.52] donna stern hi please tell me how to
[3397.20 - 3400.48] find out why lectins cause my severe
[3399.52 - 3402.96] migraines
[3400.48 - 3403.52] no one seems to know what are you taking
[3402.96 - 3406.16] just
[3403.52 - 3406.56] is it lectins either you would never
[3406.16 - 3409.92] know
[3406.56 - 3412.32] really if lectins are causing a migraine
[3409.92 - 3414.72] unless you took a pill that was filled
[3412.32 - 3416.64] with all these leptins in it like elect
[3414.72 - 3418.40] you know which you never want to do but
[3416.64 - 3420.16] you mean the case because that would be
[3418.40 - 3422.48] just ridiculous in general
[3420.16 - 3423.84] anyway i would learn about what's going
[3422.48 - 3425.60] on with foods i would learn about the
[3423.84 - 3427.04] medical medium book so you really learn
[3425.60 - 3428.80] about the lectin thing i was just
[3427.04 - 3430.96] talking about that earlier
[3428.80 - 3433.12] migraines you got you have to know the
[3430.96 - 3433.60] cause of migraines so if you go in this
[3433.12 - 3435.36] book
[3433.60 - 3436.88] there's over 200 symptoms and conditions
[3435.36 - 3437.12] you guys the book is on sale right now
[3436.88 - 3440.48] at
[3437.12 - 3443.68] amazon for nothing like 16.99
[3440.48 - 3445.44] if and if that's too much money 1699
[3443.68 - 3448.00] for this medical textbook go get it free
[3445.44 - 3450.48] at the library you look for the cause
[3448.00 - 3452.32] of migraines is what you do so i go in
[3450.48 - 3453.36] here in headaches and migraines so i'm
[3452.32 - 3456.40] in here now
[3453.36 - 3457.12] in cleanse to heal okay so let's go in
[3456.40 - 3459.44] here
[3457.12 - 3462.00] headaches and migraines all right
[3459.44 - 3465.76] lectins don't cause
[3462.00 - 3468.08] migraines lectins don't cause headaches
[3465.76 - 3469.52] and that's the whole thing there's no
[3468.08 - 3472.08] science and research
[3469.52 - 3472.64] that lines up a leptin to a headache you
[3472.08 - 3475.84] can't
[3472.64 - 3477.52] relax into a migraine because what about
[3475.84 - 3480.00] all the people that can eat all the
[3477.52 - 3481.52] lectins of any kind they want
[3480.00 - 3483.52] all the leptins they want and they don't
[3481.52 - 3485.28] have a migraine all the lectins they
[3483.52 - 3486.72] want and they don't have a symptom
[3485.28 - 3488.48] because and what about all the people
[3486.72 - 3489.68] that healed from all their symptoms and
[3488.48 - 3490.48] conditions that i was talking about
[3489.68 - 3492.72] earlier
[3490.48 - 3493.68] that never even knew about lectins
[3492.72 - 3496.32] lectins are
[3493.68 - 3497.36] just noise is what they are so we have
[3496.32 - 3499.92] to be careful
[3497.36 - 3502.00] true cause of headaches and migraines
[3499.92 - 3504.40] i'm in here now and cleanse the heel
[3502.00 - 3506.24] okay when physical injury is not a
[3504.40 - 3507.28] factor and has been ruled out so
[3506.24 - 3509.28] physical injury
[3507.28 - 3510.72] has been ruled out for your migraine and
[3509.28 - 3513.60] headache okay
[3510.72 - 3515.60] commonly caused is over the 30 varieties
[3513.60 - 3516.80] of shingles the shingles virus you can
[3515.60 - 3518.72] talk to your doctor
[3516.80 - 3520.08] bring them bring this textbook medical
[3518.72 - 3523.28] textbook to your doctor
[3520.08 - 3525.20] can talk to your doctor about it but
[3523.28 - 3526.96] there's over 30 varieties of shingles
[3525.20 - 3528.40] and some of those varieties many of
[3526.96 - 3530.96] those varieties cause
[3528.40 - 3532.88] migraines they affect the nerves it's a
[3530.96 - 3534.80] nerve-based migraine
[3532.88 - 3536.32] when you look in here okay when you look
[3534.80 - 3538.08] in here but go to your doctor
[3536.32 - 3539.68] and and and talk to your doctor about
[3538.08 - 3541.20] this information so your doctor can
[3539.68 - 3541.84] actually help you find out what's going
[3541.20 - 3544.56] on
[3541.84 - 3546.96] so epstein-barr can actually produce
[3544.56 - 3549.44] neurotoxin giving people headaches
[3546.96 - 3551.76] i've seen bar giving people migraines
[3549.44 - 3553.52] and and what happens is the vagus nerve
[3551.76 - 3554.80] and the phrenic nerves play a role they
[3553.52 - 3557.76] get inflamed
[3554.80 - 3558.80] toxic heavy metals actually create
[3557.76 - 3560.72] migraines
[3558.80 - 3562.24] toxic heavy metals as well so it's
[3560.72 - 3563.04] really important to understand all these
[3562.24 - 3565.52] different things
[3563.04 - 3567.52] you know it's important to understand so
[3565.52 - 3569.92] um all these different things can do
[3567.52 - 3571.84] this and lectins are not why people have
[3569.92 - 3573.04] headaches and migraines let's talk about
[3571.84 - 3574.16] histamines right now
[3573.04 - 3576.24] i'm looking through kinds of heal
[3574.16 - 3577.84] there's over 200 symptoms of conditions
[3576.24 - 3579.76] and in the chapter in the back of the
[3577.84 - 3581.68] book you can see and you can find out
[3579.76 - 3583.20] your causes and go to your doctor
[3581.68 - 3585.04] and and and talked about that and you'll
[3583.20 - 3587.04] see supplements and protocols
[3585.04 - 3588.48] and how to use them and you can bring
[3587.04 - 3590.16] that to your doctor as well
[3588.48 - 3592.24] that's what i would do if i had a
[3590.16 - 3594.56] migraine i'd take this book
[3592.24 - 3596.00] i'd read it i take a look at it talk to
[3594.56 - 3597.60] your doctor if you want of course
[3596.00 - 3599.44] there's hundreds of customized
[3597.60 - 3600.96] protocols in medical medium information
[3599.44 - 3601.44] it's not one thing if you hear somebody
[3600.96 - 3604.40] say
[3601.44 - 3606.00] i tried medical medium you have did you
[3604.40 - 3606.96] do 32 ounces of celery juice every
[3606.00 - 3608.16] single morning
[3606.96 - 3609.84] did you do the heavy metal detox
[3608.16 - 3611.28] smoothie every day did you do the
[3609.84 - 3612.80] morning cleanse or wait did you do the
[3611.28 - 3614.32] 369 advance cleanse
[3612.80 - 3616.16] did you do the um did you do the
[3614.32 - 3617.84] meditations in the medical medium books
[3616.16 - 3619.52] did you do all these things that you can
[3617.84 - 3621.60] customize
[3619.52 - 3623.12] thousands of protocols in here so
[3621.60 - 3625.68] somebody can get better because
[3623.12 - 3627.52] everybody has something different inside
[3625.68 - 3628.88] of them causing the problem
[3627.52 - 3630.72] so let's go into this a little bit about
[3628.88 - 3634.72] histamine people think food
[3630.72 - 3637.44] creates histamines but no
[3634.72 - 3638.88] yeah you can get elevated histamines
[3637.44 - 3642.24] when eating foods but
[3638.88 - 3645.76] why because certain foods
[3642.24 - 3649.28] feed bugs and other certain
[3645.76 - 3652.80] foods kill bugs
[3649.28 - 3657.20] that's how it works certain foods
[3652.80 - 3660.48] feed bugs driving up histamines
[3657.20 - 3663.92] okay and certain foods
[3660.48 - 3666.00] kill bugs and clean up their mess
[3663.92 - 3667.52] out of the system which can drive up
[3666.00 - 3670.72] histamines
[3667.52 - 3671.92] it's a theory with nothing behind it of
[3670.72 - 3674.40] knowing what's going on
[3671.92 - 3675.36] the theory is histamines are created by
[3674.40 - 3676.88] your body
[3675.36 - 3678.32] your body's creating it it's kind of
[3676.88 - 3679.76] like similar to autoimmune it's a
[3678.32 - 3682.40] reaction occurring
[3679.76 - 3684.24] you know you really don't know why they
[3682.40 - 3686.24] have no idea but you know there's all
[3684.24 - 3688.32] these different theories to why
[3686.24 - 3690.32] but we end up lost and then we're stuck
[3688.32 - 3692.64] in the noise now about histamine food
[3690.32 - 3696.20] histamine creating foods
[3692.64 - 3699.36] and we run from our
[3696.20 - 3700.80] uncomfortable experiences with food we
[3699.36 - 3702.32] don't know what's triggering what's not
[3700.80 - 3702.64] triggering we don't know what's causing
[3702.32 - 3704.72] it
[3702.64 - 3706.72] we run we're running from our symptoms
[3704.72 - 3708.32] we're playing hide-and-go-seek
[3706.72 - 3710.16] we're now in a tree and then all of a
[3708.32 - 3711.84] sudden lectins are scaring us now we're
[3710.16 - 3713.36] somewhere else behind a bush and all of
[3711.84 - 3714.88] a sudden histamines are scaring us now
[3713.36 - 3715.92] we're hiding we're playing high go seek
[3714.88 - 3718.56] it's unbelievable
[3715.92 - 3720.88] rebecca i'm 76 days straight celery

[3750.00 - 3753.68] therapeutically just fruits and
[3751.28 - 3755.44] vegetables no uh plant-based people
[3753.68 - 3756.72] weren't doing therapeutic celery juice
[3755.44 - 3759.68] unless they got it from me
[3756.72 - 3761.60] um animal-based protein animal-based you
[3759.68 - 3762.00] know paleo diets weren't doing celery
[3761.60 - 3763.20] juice
[3762.00 - 3766.32] unless they got it for medical medium
[3763.20 - 3769.28] information it's it's a tool
[3766.32 - 3770.00] you can you know you can actually use
[3769.28 - 3772.56] and or
[3770.00 - 3774.16] the heavy metal detox um plant-based
[3772.56 - 3776.48] people aren't doing heavy metal detox
[3774.16 - 3778.88] um paleo people are doing heavy metal
[3776.48 - 3781.60] detox medical medium information is not
[3778.88 - 3782.88] uh just fruits and vegetables so you
[3781.60 - 3784.00] know stick up for me when you get a
[3782.88 - 3785.92] chance on that too
[3784.00 - 3787.60] it's about information to how you can
[3785.92 - 3788.96] therapeutically use tools
[3787.60 - 3791.52] into whatever diet belief system you
[3788.96 - 3793.36] have to seek and heal um
[3791.52 - 3795.20] so i'm really proud of you really proud
[3793.36 - 3798.40] of you so
[3795.20 - 3802.08] um kaz um what clogs the liver
[3798.40 - 3805.84] lipids made from what fructose
[3802.08 - 3807.68] what what closet closet toxins
[3805.84 - 3808.96] pesticides herbicides fungicides air
[3807.68 - 3812.16] fresheners that are plugged in
[3808.96 - 3813.60] sent to candles cologne perfume solvents
[3812.16 - 3814.80] cleaning house supplies that are that
[3813.60 - 3817.68] are conventional
[3814.80 - 3819.20] um gasoline at your gas pump fats from
[3817.68 - 3820.64] your foods lots of fats
[3819.20 - 3822.16] whether they're bad fats whether they're
[3820.64 - 3822.88] healthier fats they still clog up the
[3822.16 - 3826.16] liver
[3822.88 - 3827.44] pathogens pathogens too um pathogens and
[3826.16 - 3828.08] their toxins the epstein bars the
[3827.44 - 3830.16] shingles the
[3828.08 - 3831.76] hhv sixes cytomegalovirus simplexes
[3830.16 - 3833.76] whatever the strep all
[3831.76 - 3836.00] that's all the stuff that clogs it up
[3833.76 - 3838.72] not fructose
[3836.00 - 3840.88] but it's a good question though
[3838.72 - 3842.48] catherine eating fresh fruit and greens
[3840.88 - 3844.72] gives me bloating
[3842.48 - 3845.68] ammonia permeability with heavy heart
[3844.72 - 3848.32] palpitations
[3845.68 - 3850.32] migraines heavy breathing and making me
[3848.32 - 3851.36] bed bound making it impossible for me to
[3850.32 - 3854.64] push through
[3851.36 - 3857.28] also getting fat free also getting fat
[3854.64 - 3858.40] free until the afternoon gives me such
[3857.28 - 3861.52] heavy symptoms
[3858.40 - 3864.80] i only eat coconut milk
[3861.52 - 3867.68] and nuts as fat but
[3864.80 - 3870.24] still can't go off of it how do i make
[3867.68 - 3873.76] the transfer to fresh fruit and greens
[3870.24 - 3874.96] and less fat in a way that's not so hard
[3873.76 - 3877.84] on my body
[3874.96 - 3878.48] been off the no foods and on celery
[3877.84 - 3880.72] juice for
[3878.48 - 3882.00] one and a half years and tried enzymes
[3880.72 - 3885.52] and aloe vera juice
[3882.00 - 3889.04] and so on how do i how do i get on
[3885.52 - 3890.72] um so you know ammonia
[3889.04 - 3892.24] ammonia permeability something really
[3890.72 - 3894.80] important to know okay so ammonia
[3892.24 - 3897.52] permeability is when your hydrochloric
[3894.80 - 3898.72] acid isn't strong enough to break down a
[3897.52 - 3900.88] lot of foods this is
[3898.72 - 3902.48] medical medium information only out
[3900.88 - 3903.36] there okay so with about ammonia
[3902.48 - 3906.64] permeability
[3903.36 - 3908.24] and and that's mm info and so no one
[3906.64 - 3908.80] knows about that so if you want if
[3908.24 - 3910.72] you're new
[3908.80 - 3912.72] this is medical medium information you
[3910.72 - 3914.00] guys is all unique and original
[3912.72 - 3916.24] i'm just saying that i'm not trying to
[3914.00 - 3917.84] toot my own horn it is all unique and
[3916.24 - 3919.12] original it's from above
[3917.84 - 3920.88] and so it's important to know that i
[3919.12 - 3922.24] don't say that enough so people think
[3920.88 - 3923.76] you could just google something and it's
[3922.24 - 3925.84] out there or something or you can just
[3923.76 - 3927.20] stop on the internet search or something
[3925.84 - 3928.96] no one knows about the ammonia
[3927.20 - 3929.36] permeability they only think there's
[3928.96 - 3931.12] such
[3929.36 - 3932.72] a leaky gut or something and that's not
[3931.12 - 3934.96] correct so
[3932.72 - 3936.64] first of all that building up that hcl
[3934.96 - 3937.76] which is the stomach gland so it's about
[3936.64 - 3939.76] recovering those
[3937.76 - 3941.04] over time it's not an easy thing and
[3939.76 - 3943.20] when you have pathogens
[3941.04 - 3945.20] in the system everything gets sensitive
[3943.20 - 3946.96] the nerves get sensitive the bloating
[3945.20 - 3949.36] can happen because of the
[3946.96 - 3950.72] the hcl being so low i've talked to a
[3949.36 - 3951.44] lot of doctors about this with their
[3950.72 - 3954.64] patients
[3951.44 - 3956.32] and um and so would would like
[3954.64 - 3958.08] this is what i would do i'd go to my
[3956.32 - 3961.60] practitioner and say i want to do
[3958.08 - 3962.32] i want to do um one of the mono eating
[3961.60 - 3964.48] cleanses
[3962.32 - 3966.16] like just potato only so the celery
[3964.48 - 3967.28] juice potato and some maybe some butter
[3966.16 - 3969.76] leaf lettuce
[3967.28 - 3971.52] and or some some romaine lettuce or red
[3969.76 - 3973.84] leaf lettuce or something and i would do
[3971.52 - 3975.04] i would go mono eating if i had this
[3973.84 - 3977.36] because what happens is
[3975.04 - 3979.36] with with any types of varieties of
[3977.36 - 3979.84] gastroparesis whatsoever because that's
[3979.36 - 3981.36] what
[3979.84 - 3982.96] what happens with any with people that
[3981.36 - 3984.72] with gastroparesis any types of
[3982.96 - 3985.52] varieties of gastroparesis any type of
[3984.72 - 3987.12] varieties of
[3985.52 - 3988.48] of any kind of digestive problems and
[3987.12 - 3989.60] bloating and all these things that
[3988.48 - 3991.04] people have
[3989.60 - 3992.88] it's the mono eating cleanses are
[3991.04 - 3996.16] designed so read that whole section with
[3992.88 - 4000.16] your doctor your practitioner
[3996.16 - 4001.84] so you guys it so much information
[4000.16 - 4004.32] so much going on i don't want you
[4001.84 - 4007.36] blaming your body i don't want you
[4004.32 - 4010.24] lost in the ball of confusion
[4007.36 - 4010.96] with all the different theories they can
[4010.24 - 4014.00] really
[4010.96 - 4016.16] push you in to a corner
[4014.00 - 4018.32] and then but yet the makers of the
[4016.16 - 4019.28] theories don't know why you're sick to
[4018.32 - 4022.56] begin with
[4019.28 - 4026.16] so difficult so difficult
[4022.56 - 4027.20] um it really is so i wouldn't drink any
[4026.16 - 4028.80] water
[4027.20 - 4031.76] i wouldn't drink any water that's got
[4028.80 - 4033.92] the manipulated molecules man-made water
[4031.76 - 4036.64] and man-made water machines or man-made
[4033.92 - 4038.48] store-bought water or man-made mlm
[4036.64 - 4040.96] pyramid scheme multi-level marketing
[4038.48 - 4044.64] experiment scheme water businesses
[4040.96 - 4046.96] that mess around with molecules okay
[4044.64 - 4048.16] terrible idea terrible terrible term
[4046.96 - 4049.60] personally my opinion
[4048.16 - 4051.36] would never do it would never do the
[4049.60 - 4054.00] alkaline ionized water either
[4051.36 - 4055.28] so manipulated molecules manipulated
[4054.00 - 4058.24] water with ionizing
[4055.28 - 4059.36] i would not do it whatsoever in my
[4058.24 - 4061.68] personal
[4059.36 - 4064.08] opinion and what i've seen for years
[4061.68 - 4064.88] causes more problems and more problems
[4064.08 - 4066.80] and when you
[4064.88 - 4068.48] and the only reason why people get they
[4066.80 - 4068.88] think they get a benefit from one or the
[4068.48 - 4070.56] other
[4068.88 - 4071.92] is because they're already doing things
[4070.56 - 4074.00] to counter it
[4071.92 - 4075.60] they're countering it with doing good
[4074.00 - 4077.04] things for themselves like getting rid
[4075.60 - 4077.76] of processed foods getting rid of other
[4077.04 - 4080.40] things but
[4077.76 - 4082.40] in the end those waters will just those
[4080.40 - 4084.00] mutated waters will just send you down
[4082.40 - 4085.76] the wrong direction so be careful with
[4084.00 - 4089.12] those i always say that i'm
[4085.76 - 4092.80] a big a big um
[4089.12 - 4092.80] not a big fan of them so
[4093.68 - 4098.08] jamie you got cleansed the heel you love

[4146.32 - 4149.60] stuff out
[4147.20 - 4151.44] it could it could possibly stimulate a

[4174.64 - 4177.52] apartment just had an insecticide
[4176.16 - 4178.08] treatment all through and a termite
[4177.52 - 4180.72] treatment

[4180.72 - 4184.08] on
[4181.60 - 4184.96] about just how much could be going on
[4184.08 - 4189.84] there so just
[4184.96 - 4189.84] look at all that and see what's going on
[4190.72 - 4195.12] um kayla oh i always drink the alkaline
[4193.44 - 4198.00] water from trader joe's
[4195.12 - 4198.80] um listen the trader joe's by the way
[4198.00 - 4200.32] it's a great place
[4198.80 - 4202.48] great place to get food and so forth and
[4200.32 - 4203.44] everything but um but as far as out yeah
[4202.48 - 4206.48] the alkaline
[4203.44 - 4209.52] the alkaline ionized water um
[4206.48 - 4211.60] it in my opinion overall alkaline
[4209.52 - 4214.16] ionized water in my opinion
[4211.60 - 4216.32] is not is not a great it's not a great
[4214.16 - 4219.28] thing and i wouldn't do the bottled
[4216.32 - 4220.00] man-made manipulated alkaline water i
[4219.28 - 4222.40] wouldn't do that
[4220.00 - 4223.68] either so i wouldn't do either or it's
[4222.40 - 4225.60] not a good thing
[4223.68 - 4227.68] i i talked about that in past i'm going
[4225.60 - 4229.12] to do a big water talk again
[4227.68 - 4230.88] so i'm going to do a whole nother water
[4229.12 - 4233.52] talk and i'm going to go into it through
[4230.88 - 4234.40] water purifiers water purification water
[4233.52 - 4235.84] filtration
[4234.40 - 4237.68] ions this that i'm just going to talk
[4235.84 - 4240.00] about all of it eventually again
[4237.68 - 4241.84] so brenda why do fresh fruits and
[4240.00 - 4244.56] vegetables make my mouth itchy
[4241.84 - 4246.16] an esophagus swell fresh fruits and
[4244.56 - 4250.00] vegetables do
[4246.16 - 4250.40] um which fresh fruit or which vegetable
[4250.00 - 4253.20] too
[4250.40 - 4253.68] does one do it more than another um
[4253.20 - 4256.32] what's
[4253.68 - 4258.16] you know what you know what symptoms are
[4256.32 - 4260.56] you dealing with on a bait
[4258.16 - 4262.80] is anything else make it happen at all
[4260.56 - 4264.16] um that's not making it happen
[4262.80 - 4266.56] because i just went through this whole
[4264.16 - 4269.04] thing that what we do is when we
[4266.56 - 4270.40] when we push away more fresh fruits and
[4269.04 - 4272.32] more vegetables and all that
[4270.40 - 4273.68] and we get cornered and now we're eating
[4272.32 - 4275.28] very little things
[4273.68 - 4276.72] to the point where eating basically just
[4275.28 - 4278.80] meat or something it
[4276.72 - 4280.32] because we're not getting a reaction we
[4278.80 - 4282.80] what happens is the fresh fruits and
[4280.32 - 4284.80] vegetables they sweep out the neurotoxin
[4282.80 - 4286.48] so when you got neurotoxins we get in
[4284.80 - 4289.20] trouble with the neurotoxins
[4286.48 - 4290.80] and so neurotoxins are a big part of why
[4289.20 - 4291.76] so many people are dealing with those
[4290.80 - 4293.92] symptoms
[4291.76 - 4295.44] um but you can you know those
[4293.92 - 4297.44] neurotoxins can be trouble
[4295.44 - 4298.80] and they can make all that happen but
[4297.44 - 4300.08] what i would do is look
[4298.80 - 4303.12] here's what i would do if that was
[4300.08 - 4305.52] happening in me i i would get the book
[4303.12 - 4306.56] look at the mono eating cleanse so you
[4305.52 - 4309.28] can actually
[4306.56 - 4310.88] you can you can go in that direction the
[4309.28 - 4312.24] model eating cleanses that's what i've
[4310.88 - 4315.20] always told doctors
[4312.24 - 4316.48] to tell their patients and and and so
[4315.20 - 4318.56] many doctors right now
[4316.48 - 4320.16] that i have uh that i'm friends with
[4318.56 - 4321.52] that i know that contact me every day
[4320.16 - 4322.72] because the books are everywhere on the
[4321.52 - 4326.08] planet so doctors just
[4322.72 - 4327.84] they contact us non-stop um
[4326.08 - 4329.36] and they want information for patients
[4327.84 - 4330.48] and so forth and i've always told try
[4329.36 - 4333.12] the mono eating
[4330.48 - 4334.56] um and as you're healing you can end up
[4333.12 - 4336.56] eating more so what i've noticed
[4334.56 - 4337.92] that i've had doctors do this with their
[4336.56 - 4339.60] patients is
[4337.92 - 4340.72] when they do the mono eating long enough
[4339.60 - 4342.16] they start bringing in more and they
[4340.72 - 4343.44] don't get that swelling and they don't
[4342.16 - 4344.48] get that reaction then they don't get
[4343.44 - 4345.20] that swelling they don't get that
[4344.48 - 4348.08] reaction and
[4345.20 - 4348.08] therefore therefore
[4353.28 - 4357.84] looking at all the different questions
[4361.60 - 4364.72] spring water is amazing
[4365.28 - 4368.64] patricia said same here
[4369.60 - 4373.44] daisy when starting the heavy metal
[4371.44 - 4374.72] detox i started getting dizzy and
[4373.44 - 4376.40] lightheaded too
[4374.72 - 4378.48] then it went away after pushing out all
[4376.40 - 4379.44] the toxins exactly you pushed out all
[4378.48 - 4381.04] the toxins
[4379.44 - 4382.72] what happens is that disney
[4381.04 - 4383.92] enlightenment lightheadedness
[4382.72 - 4385.44] you know could have been one of your
[4383.92 - 4386.72] symptoms daisy from like that you've
[4385.44 - 4387.92] been dealing with on and off for years
[4386.72 - 4389.36] did you ever get dizziness
[4387.92 - 4391.20] at all before and then once you start
[4389.36 - 4392.32] pushing that out then that's the whole
[4391.20 - 4392.80] point you get that out and then you're
[4392.32 - 4394.40] you're
[4392.80 - 4396.32] you're you're free and you move forward
[4394.40 - 4398.40] with your life and you know and if
[4396.32 - 4401.60] you get more could be in there though
[4398.40 - 4405.36] that needs to be pushed out
[4401.60 - 4405.84] um so as far as different waters and
[4405.36 - 4409.20] stuff
[4405.84 - 4411.68] so andy andy you said which
[4409.20 - 4413.68] kind of water then spring water is great
[4411.68 - 4415.20] reverse osmosis is great
[4413.68 - 4417.28] distilled water is fine but make sure
[4415.20 - 4420.72] you squeeze lemon and put lemon in it
[4417.28 - 4424.16] purified uh purified water spring water
[4420.72 - 4425.84] um you know yeah a really good purifier
[4424.16 - 4427.76] could be great i like berkey that's one
[4425.84 - 4429.76] of the purifiers out there that i like
[4427.76 - 4431.04] near g you can do that get a whole house
[4429.76 - 4433.28] filtration that's
[4431.04 - 4435.12] you know you can get a purifier but but
[4433.28 - 4436.80] yeah i know the ionizers
[4435.12 - 4438.24] don't like alkaline ionizers water
[4436.80 - 4440.56] machines i don't like the also i don't
[4438.24 - 4443.76] like the other thing too the molecular
[4440.56 - 4445.28] like mutated water that's out there too
[4443.76 - 4446.72] man-made molecular it's just
[4445.28 - 4448.72] for the molecules it's straight it
[4446.72 - 4451.36] actually changes the molecule structures
[4448.72 - 4454.00] and all that just don't like that at all
[4451.36 - 4456.16] so yeah spring water ro water uh
[4454.00 - 4458.00] purified water sure whatever put lemon
[4456.16 - 4459.68] in it
[4458.00 - 4462.00] michelle said this is so helpful anthony
[4459.68 - 4463.36] oh bless your heart i'm trying trying my
[4462.00 - 4465.20] best to get you guys as much free
[4463.36 - 4466.16] information as i can and so you guys
[4465.20 - 4469.04] have every
[4466.16 - 4470.08] opportunity you can too so it's
[4469.04 - 4473.60] important i'm just
[4470.08 - 4473.60] reading you know
[4474.40 - 4479.84] masela says he said he drinks alkaline
[4476.64 - 4481.44] water from trader joe's no i don't
[4479.84 - 4483.04] no i don't drink alkaline water from
[4481.44 - 4486.40] trader joe's
[4483.04 - 4489.12] um so if i'm in trader joe's i
[4486.40 - 4490.48] i buy the spring water that's what i do
[4489.12 - 4491.68] so if i'm in trader joe's i buy the
[4490.48 - 4493.60] spring water because trader joe's is
[4491.68 - 4496.96] great spring water
[4493.60 - 4500.64] but i don't drink alkaline water no
[4496.96 - 4504.08] meaning man-manipulated created alkaline
[4500.64 - 4504.08] water i don't personally drink
