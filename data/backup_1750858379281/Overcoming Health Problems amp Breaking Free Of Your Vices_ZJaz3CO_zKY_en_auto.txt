[71.68 - 78.24] you get ostracized you get
[75.04 - 79.20] picked on you get yelled at if you want
[78.24 - 82.08] to try to
[79.20 - 83.76] break a vice because it makes everybody
[82.08 - 85.68] else feel uncomfortable
[83.76 - 87.12] so if you try to break a vice of some
[85.68 - 88.56] kind like you're hanging out with
[87.12 - 90.16] somebody you're hanging out with family
[88.56 - 93.04] you're hanging out with friends
[90.16 - 93.60] and you don't want that cheeseburger so
[93.04 - 95.84] you're just
[93.60 - 97.12] weird right so you're just weird that
[95.84 - 97.76] ever happened to you the roots report

[107.12 - 110.72] so you're the one made to feel
[109.36 - 113.12] uncomfortable right
[110.72 - 114.32] and and so we're not allowed to break
[113.12 - 116.80] our vices did you ever
[114.32 - 118.96] ever see that we're not allowed to break
[116.80 - 121.60] our vices
[118.96 - 123.28] so breaking our vices is kind of like
[121.60 - 124.88] off limits
[123.28 - 127.36] if you start breaking your vices
[124.88 - 130.64] whatever those vices are caffeine
[127.36 - 134.00] coffee cheese right
[130.64 - 134.64] cheese milk butter whatever those vices
[134.00 - 137.20] might be
[134.64 - 139.20] pizza something that you guys you know
[137.20 - 141.36] you guys like so maybe some pizza i got
[139.20 - 145.44] a pizza right here and
[141.36 - 147.92] whatever that vice is you have to
[145.44 - 150.08] you have to stay in line and we get
[147.92 - 151.60] punished if we break that line if we
[150.08 - 154.48] come out of that line right
[151.60 - 155.36] get punished by people around us loved
[154.48 - 158.56] ones
[155.36 - 160.16] friends people we know and
[158.56 - 161.60] you're just that weirdo you're that
[160.16 - 162.96] weirdo you're worried about your health
[161.60 - 164.40] or you're that you're that weirdo that
[162.96 - 166.08] has health issues
[164.40 - 167.36] and that's kind of what happens out
[166.08 - 169.04] there and what what's going on with
[167.36 - 170.00] people so much is that they're up
[169.04 - 172.64] against that so it's hard
[170.00 - 174.24] to break your vices even if you're
[172.64 - 176.56] breaking coffee even if you
[174.24 - 177.52] you want to break your vice you still go
[176.56 - 180.08] up against this
[177.52 - 181.60] michael says 11 days no coffee feeling
[180.08 - 185.68] better than ever
[181.60 - 188.32] incredible teresa i bought the mm-900
[185.68 - 190.40] and love it i think my celery juice
[188.32 - 192.32] tastes better it tastes better for me
[190.40 - 194.00] that's what i've noticed when you have a
[192.32 - 195.76] cold pressed juicer especially one like
[194.00 - 196.40] this that squeezes all the juice out of
[195.76 - 198.48] it
[196.40 - 200.16] because it's really it's taking all that
[198.48 - 201.92] flavor out it's like
[200.16 - 204.40] removing that flavor the way it should
[201.92 - 206.32] be out of that fiber and pulp and giving
[204.40 - 209.92] you that straight herbal extract
[206.32 - 211.44] extraction so you know vices have been
[209.92 - 214.80] difficult for so many people
[211.44 - 216.80] not because they're hard to break
[214.80 - 218.64] even though that's one aspect of it
[216.80 - 220.96] right you guys on tick tock
[218.64 - 221.84] it's it's hard enough to break it break
[220.96 - 224.32] a vice
[221.84 - 225.36] right that's hard enough i get it but
[224.32 - 228.80] it's not the whole
[225.36 - 231.92] show it's not the whole issue
[228.80 - 233.92] it's not the whole problem it
[231.92 - 235.76] it's more than that it's the people
[233.92 - 238.00] around us and i'm not
[235.76 - 240.24] saying we should be upset about the
[238.00 - 243.36] people around us that's not it at all
[240.24 - 247.12] it's just that we're made to feel like
[243.36 - 249.04] we're in the wrong doing if we're trying
[247.12 - 251.68] not to have that donut
[249.04 - 252.40] if we're trying not to have that you
[251.68 - 254.08] know because
[252.40 - 255.92] in the thing is is they got the upper
[254.08 - 258.56] hand like
[255.92 - 259.12] our friends our family our loved ones or
[258.56 - 261.84] people
[259.12 - 262.88] in at work or whatever it is right
[261.84 - 265.04] co-workers
[262.88 - 268.00] they got the upper edge if they're
[265.04 - 270.48] eating all the bad stuff
[268.00 - 271.36] or all the vice stuff they got the upper
[270.48 - 274.32] edge
[271.36 - 276.48] because they know like we got that
[274.32 - 278.24] little voice inside of us that's saying
[276.48 - 279.84] you know what i'll just do this donut
[278.24 - 281.76] one more time
[279.84 - 283.44] i haven't had a donut in a while let me
[281.76 - 285.68] just do this cookie let me do this
[283.44 - 289.36] chocolate chip cookie one more time
[285.68 - 291.76] let me do this donut one more time and
[289.36 - 293.84] i'll start to i'll fix it after that i
[291.76 - 294.96] won't do any more after that todd says
[293.84 - 298.64] what about a little
[294.96 - 300.16] mushroom coffee um well the mushroom
[298.64 - 303.60] thing is fine
[300.16 - 306.16] the mushroom that's okay but
[303.60 - 308.32] you know what what i don't like is they
[306.16 - 310.80] take an addictive substance
[308.32 - 313.04] and then they try to make you feel good
[310.80 - 314.88] about that addictive substance
[313.04 - 316.16] by adding something good for you like a
[314.88 - 318.16] rishi mushroom or
[316.16 - 319.36] chaga mushroom or some kind of mushroom
[318.16 - 322.72] to the coffee
[319.36 - 324.88] so if you like being totally jaked over
[322.72 - 325.76] tricked then yeah have your mushroom
[324.88 - 327.92] coffee

[330.08 - 333.60] drink your mushroom coffee if you want
[331.52 - 335.52] to be a sucker because
[333.60 - 336.72] the industry put the mushroom coffee
[335.52 - 338.72] together
[336.72 - 340.08] so that you that you would stay on your
[338.72 - 341.44] coffee buy more coffee

[436.56 - 440.24] we're talking about lots of stuff here
[438.88 - 441.84] we're talking about how to heal eczema
[440.24 - 443.92] psoriasis we're talking about
[441.84 - 445.76] how to heal rosacea we're talking about
[443.92 - 449.44] how to heal different health conditions
[445.76 - 452.32] all this is important using celery juice
[449.44 - 454.08] right and then we're talking about vices
[452.32 - 455.76] how we get trapped in these vices
[454.08 - 458.16] because the people
[455.76 - 459.28] the people around us god bless them the
[458.16 - 461.44] people around us
[459.28 - 462.88] have the upper hand because if they're
[461.44 - 464.48] eating those donuts
[462.88 - 466.72] and they're eating that sushi yeah
[464.48 - 469.28] sushi's a junk food if they're eating
[466.72 - 470.80] those burgers if they're eating the
[469.28 - 472.56] cheese and the milk
[470.80 - 475.12] and the bread and the pizza and they're
[472.56 - 479.20] having the pizza they got the upper hand
[475.12 - 482.80] they do they got the upper hand
[479.20 - 486.00] it's important to know and that
[482.80 - 489.04] upper hand is really difficult
[486.00 - 490.64] on so many it really is it is
[489.04 - 492.40] so i know i disappeared on you guys a
[490.64 - 492.80] little bit so it's just talking about
[492.40 - 496.40] how
[492.80 - 497.68] the people around us that keep us on our
[496.40 - 500.16] vices
[497.68 - 501.20] have that edge and they have that upper
[500.16 - 503.44] hand
[501.20 - 504.56] and that's the hard part one of the hard
[503.44 - 505.92] parts right there
[504.56 - 507.68] you're going to see family you're going
[505.92 - 508.96] to see friends you're not going to want
[507.68 - 510.08] to turn down the donut you're not going
[508.96 - 511.04] to want to turn down the bagel you're
[510.08 - 512.32] not going to want to turn down the
[511.04 - 514.32] burger or the pizza
[512.32 - 516.40] certainly not the pizza right not going
[514.32 - 518.96] to want to turn down the cookies
[516.40 - 520.96] even if they're gluten-free cookies so
[518.96 - 524.40] we're stuck
[520.96 - 526.08] we're stuck in the vice you know and we
[524.40 - 527.84] need family and friend many people say i
[526.08 - 528.32] need my family and friends some people
[527.84 - 531.12] say well
[528.32 - 531.52] i live life alone i don't need i don't
[531.12 - 533.20] need
[531.52 - 534.56] you know family around me some people
[533.20 - 536.24] i've heard this from different people
[534.56 - 538.96] all through my life
[536.24 - 539.84] where but you eventually run into
[538.96 - 542.80] somebody
[539.84 - 543.52] or someone and even if it's somebody you
[542.80 - 545.36] haven't talked to
[543.52 - 546.96] in so long michelle l good to see you
[545.36 - 551.04] like sabotage
[546.96 - 553.12] and yeah so the sabotage occurs
[551.04 - 554.88] and we get tangled up in it we get
[553.12 - 558.16] caught in that sabotage
[554.88 - 560.64] that's exactly it i think that
[558.16 - 562.56] if you're going to break a vice you have
[560.64 - 566.24] to be aware of this stuff
[562.56 - 567.84] you do okay no one's a bad person for
[566.24 - 570.80] eating burgers and
[567.84 - 573.68] for eating hot dogs and eating chicken
[570.80 - 576.40] fingers and eating pizza
[573.68 - 579.36] no one's a bad person for gobbling down
[576.40 - 581.68] vegan cookies by the truckload
[579.36 - 583.52] gobbling down all those vegan cookies
[581.68 - 584.40] and chocolate chip cookies gluten-free
[583.52 - 587.04] cookies
[584.40 - 588.96] and cakes and doughnuts no one's a bad
[587.04 - 590.48] person for eating the milk cheese and
[588.96 - 591.92] the butter
[590.48 - 594.08] it's not about that it's not about if
[591.92 - 596.96] you're good or you're bad
[594.08 - 598.32] it's not about that at all but we're
[596.96 - 601.52] made to feel
[598.32 - 603.44] bad we're made to feel bad
[601.52 - 604.56] by the people around us a lot of times
[603.44 - 608.16] if we want
[604.56 - 609.76] to change the way we're doing things
[608.16 - 611.44] and one of the reasons why we change the
[609.76 - 613.20] way of doing things i mean you guys know
[611.44 - 614.80] this you start getting sick
[613.20 - 617.44] you start getting some symptoms in your
[614.80 - 619.60] life lunell good to see you
[617.44 - 620.72] and you start getting to a place in your
[619.60 - 622.24] life where you're sick you've got
[620.72 - 624.00] symptoms you're seeing doctors you're
[622.24 - 625.92] seeing people and it's like whoa i gotta
[624.00 - 626.56] get off the processed foods i gotta get
[625.92 - 628.72] off the
[626.56 - 630.84] fried greasy foods i have to get off of
[628.72 - 634.56] this stuff
[630.84 - 635.84] and we get into a place where
[634.56 - 639.20] it's hard to do that with the people
[635.84 - 641.84] around us and so it takes a willpower
[639.20 - 644.24] takes a will power because we're going
[641.84 - 646.56] to feel like we're a bad person
[644.24 - 648.80] we better eat that donut we better have
[646.56 - 651.28] that slice of pizza
[648.80 - 652.56] but they got the upper hand our friends
[651.28 - 656.24] their family
[652.56 - 659.04] our loved ones that that are not
[656.24 - 661.76] really that supportive of changing our
[659.04 - 663.76] foods they got the upper hand
[661.76 - 664.80] because man that upper hand is pretty
[663.76 - 666.08] intense it's like
[664.80 - 668.32] well i'm just eating a grilled cheese
[666.08 - 669.36] sandwich right now and
[668.32 - 671.36] how come you're not gonna have the
[669.36 - 673.12] grilled cheese sandwich with me you know
[671.36 - 674.00] i'm just having the french toast and the
[673.12 - 675.36] waffles
[674.00 - 677.60] with all the butter on it i'm just

[776.24 - 779.20] i'm working with omega
[777.44 - 780.56] you guys know that right working with
[779.20 - 783.28] omega because
[780.56 - 785.52] this is a medical device in my opinion
[783.28 - 788.48] it's a medical device
[785.52 - 789.92] juicers are medical devices so they're
[788.48 - 793.28] extractors
[789.92 - 795.68] for medicine did you know that when
[793.28 - 797.20] big pharma did you guys know this a big
[795.68 - 800.08] pharma make all their drugs
[797.20 - 800.96] when they make all their drugs out there
[800.08 - 802.56] right
[800.96 - 804.80] did you know that they're doing
[802.56 - 806.40] extractions that's what they do
[804.80 - 808.16] they're synthesizing but they're also
[806.40 - 809.28] extracting they're synthesizing they're
[808.16 - 812.32] extracting
[809.28 - 815.36] they're they have machines
[812.32 - 817.76] in big pharma that are like juicers
[815.36 - 819.76] so and they have these machines in big
[817.76 - 823.36] pharma that are like juicers they're
[819.76 - 825.28] medical style juicers they're geared for
[823.36 - 827.04] they're small too they're like small
[825.28 - 828.24] machines they have them in their drug
[827.04 - 831.60] factories
[828.24 - 834.08] and they're there to extract and
[831.60 - 835.28] and with the alchemy that they work with
[834.08 - 837.84] so
[835.28 - 840.16] what people what no one gives credits to
[837.84 - 842.80] juicers like this that's a medical
[840.16 - 843.92] device a medical tool but it's
[842.80 - 845.60] downplayed
[843.92 - 847.52] that's always downplayed out there when
[845.60 - 850.88] it's the one of the most important
[847.52 - 852.80] critical devices in your life
[850.88 - 854.40] you don't have a juicer i recommend
[852.80 - 856.56] someday getting a juicer
[854.40 - 858.24] if you don't get the mm 900 hds even
[856.56 - 859.36] though it's on sale right now then and
[858.24 - 861.44] you get another juicer
[859.36 - 862.96] fine i want you to be able to juice
[861.44 - 864.80] that's the number one goal
[862.96 - 866.64] so it doesn't matter to me in the end
[864.80 - 868.00] like what juicer you have this one just
[866.64 - 869.52] saves me money
[868.00 - 871.12] i talk about that all the time people
[869.52 - 872.48] are getting their juicers who have order
[871.12 - 873.84] health with liz good to see you on tick
[872.48 - 876.00] tock
[873.84 - 877.60] good to see you too good to see you too
[876.00 - 881.04] so what about ice cream
[877.60 - 882.96] once per week um anthony
[881.04 - 885.04] um strike seven seven good question i
[882.96 - 886.48] got a friend calling in
[885.04 - 888.40] i've got a friend calling in too and
[886.48 - 891.92] we'll you know that's actually
[888.40 - 893.52] gonna talk about that as well so
[891.92 - 895.28] you guys when it comes down to this
[893.52 - 896.08] herbal extractors what you're looking at
[895.28 - 898.00] right now
[896.08 - 900.48] it's extracting medicine that's why i
[898.00 - 903.92] call it a medical tool a medical device
[900.48 - 903.92] because it extracts medicine
[905.84 - 911.28] hey how you been good good i'm about to
[909.20 - 914.56] have
[911.28 - 918.72] i'm about to have a hot dog
[914.56 - 920.24] yeah i'm not over doing it
[918.72 - 922.16] just once every couple of weeks i have a
[920.24 - 925.84] hot dog
[922.16 - 927.84] yeah it's moderation i talk about the
[925.84 - 929.36] moderation thing all the time right
[927.84 - 930.64] because that's what my doctor keeps on
[929.36 - 932.64] telling me i can have what i want in
[930.64 - 934.56] moderation
[932.64 - 937.28] so i just leave it to a hot dog once
[934.56 - 940.40] every couple weeks
[937.28 - 942.24] i had one five days ago well i did okay
[940.40 - 944.88] that's okay i'm having one five days ago
[942.24 - 947.60] and having one now
[944.88 - 949.36] so that's not like two every two weeks
[947.60 - 951.68] but this is a different month and i just
[949.36 - 955.92] i just feel like i needed that
[951.68 - 956.24] yeah i'll just wait a little longer and
[955.92 - 958.24] then
[956.24 - 960.80] i'll wait it out and try to have my hot
[958.24 - 964.24] dog a week for and a half from now
[960.80 - 966.72] think i can do it well
[964.24 - 966.72] the other
[967.28 - 973.12] i've been having this chocolate fudge
[970.64 - 976.08] ice cream
[973.12 - 979.12] i'm doing two i'm doing this chocolate
[976.08 - 983.36] fudge ice cream every two weeks
[979.12 - 985.04] yeah what what's wrong with that
[983.36 - 986.48] so if i'm doing the hot dog every two
[985.04 - 987.68] weeks i'm doing chocolate fudge
[986.48 - 989.84] ice cream every two weeks did i have
[987.68 - 994.56] pizza yeah i had pizza
[989.84 - 994.56] i have a pizza ready for
[994.64 - 997.68] my friends are coming over later we're
[996.00 - 1001.12] going to have some pizza but i haven't
[997.68 - 1001.12] had a pizza in two weeks
[1001.28 - 1005.36] my doctor said moderation works it's it
[1003.92 - 1008.56] works so what i'm doing is i'm
[1005.36 - 1008.56] practicing moderation
[1008.64 - 1012.96] i'm having a pizza every two weeks a
[1010.88 - 1014.32] chocolate fudge sundae every week and
[1012.96 - 1017.36] i'm having a hot dog
[1014.32 - 1019.76] every two weeks so i'm doing the
[1017.36 - 1023.12] moderation thing really well
[1019.76 - 1026.56] yeah i had a little cheese the other day
[1023.12 - 1028.72] and i had some bread so that's like a
[1026.56 - 1031.68] pizza
[1028.72 - 1032.24] um yeah i gotta eat my chocolate fudge
[1031.68 - 1035.60] sundae
[1032.24 - 1038.24] moderation is yeah i could
[1035.60 - 1039.68] look i know i'm lactose intolerant is
[1038.24 - 1043.20] that even real
[1039.68 - 1047.44] lactose intolerance i know i'm i'm
[1043.20 - 1049.52] i shouldn't be having dairy i know
[1047.44 - 1050.88] but but i'm having it once a week right
[1049.52 - 1054.40] now
[1050.88 - 1054.40] okay all right i gotta go
[1054.72 - 1058.24] but vices are ridiculously hard to break
[1057.20 - 1060.40] because of
[1058.24 - 1062.00] people around us that's one reason why
[1060.40 - 1063.68] they're really hard to break
[1062.00 - 1065.20] it's not because anybody's bad it's not
[1063.68 - 1066.56] because there's bad people around us
[1065.20 - 1067.68] there's not because of any of those
[1066.56 - 1070.80] reasons
[1067.68 - 1071.92] it's because of the reason of it's they
[1070.80 - 1073.76] got the upper hand
[1071.92 - 1075.84] i mean you're starving you're hungry
[1073.76 - 1078.56] it's like hey look i'm just
[1075.84 - 1080.32] bringing home a pizza um no you stick to
[1078.56 - 1083.76] your plant-based diet
[1080.32 - 1084.64] um no you stick to your no you stick to
[1083.76 - 1086.96] whatever it is your
[1084.64 - 1088.32] your dairy-free diet and but we're gonna
[1086.96 - 1089.36] have everybody in the family is gonna
[1088.32 - 1091.28] have a pizza
[1089.36 - 1092.64] so let's put the pizza on the counter
[1091.28 - 1095.52] everybody dig in
[1092.64 - 1096.32] let's grab it oh you can't have it yeah
[1095.52 - 1098.72] why not
[1096.32 - 1100.32] just have a slice don't worry just have
[1098.72 - 1101.20] a slice what do you mean you can't have
[1100.32 - 1103.92] pizza tonight
[1101.20 - 1105.44] have a slice of pizza tonight one slice
[1103.92 - 1108.96] is not gonna hurt
[1105.44 - 1111.20] it's not gonna hurt um
[1108.96 - 1112.96] so we run into we run into this all the
[1111.20 - 1115.52] time
[1112.96 - 1116.80] we run into the solar panels reading
[1115.52 - 1118.64] comments as they come up
[1116.80 - 1120.40] death by a thousand cuts is what it ends
[1118.64 - 1122.56] up being so we're up against the death
[1120.40 - 1124.32] by a thousand cuts
[1122.56 - 1126.08] so we get a job here we get a job there
[1124.32 - 1127.84] we get a job here we get a job there
[1126.08 - 1130.96] what are you guys doing to go against
[1127.84 - 1133.04] those cuts what are we doing
[1130.96 - 1134.48] dairy products feeds the pathogens that
[1133.04 - 1137.28] are inside of us
[1134.48 - 1138.80] so milk cheese butter will feed all the
[1137.28 - 1142.08] bugs inside of us
[1138.80 - 1144.48] eggs will feed the bugs inside of us
[1142.08 - 1145.92] so all these little bugs inside of us
[1144.48 - 1148.40] they'll get fed by
[1145.92 - 1150.32] milk cheese and butter so you got your
[1148.40 - 1154.88] stick of butter right here
[1150.32 - 1157.68] viruses love butter they do
[1154.88 - 1159.28] and it takes weeks to get the dairy out
[1157.68 - 1160.88] so the question by the way that was a
[1159.28 - 1162.96] really good question
[1160.88 - 1164.08] about should i have some ice cream once
[1162.96 - 1166.00] a week is that okay
[1164.08 - 1167.20] or i eat ice cream once a week is that
[1166.00 - 1168.88] okay
[1167.20 - 1170.80] strike seven seven thanks anthony very
[1168.88 - 1173.28] much thank you for being on here
[1170.80 - 1175.20] so that's a really good question but it
[1173.28 - 1176.40] takes more than a week to get the dairy
[1175.20 - 1179.76] out of you
[1176.40 - 1181.92] so it'll take 10 14 days
[1179.76 - 1183.92] sometimes longer depends on how like
[1181.92 - 1186.32] stagnant and sluggish your liver is
[1183.92 - 1187.28] so getting that cheese out of you or
[1186.32 - 1189.68] that
[1187.28 - 1190.64] ice cream out of you that milk out of
[1189.68 - 1192.64] you
[1190.64 - 1194.16] getting that out any kind of dairy
[1192.64 - 1196.56] product doesn't just
[1194.16 - 1198.16] it doesn't get out in two days like i'm
[1196.56 - 1200.00] gonna go to bathroom and it's all gonna
[1198.16 - 1201.36] be cleaned out it just doesn't it sits
[1200.00 - 1202.80] on the sides of your intestinal tract
[1201.36 - 1205.12] for days and days and days
[1202.80 - 1206.24] over a week it's there feeding all the
[1205.12 - 1208.24] different bugs
[1206.24 - 1210.00] all the different pathogens so if you've
[1208.24 - 1212.08] got eczema psoriasis
[1210.00 - 1214.08] if you've got rosacea if you have acne
[1212.08 - 1216.40] if you have vitiligo
[1214.08 - 1217.92] if you have any condition at all any
[1216.40 - 1218.64] condition it doesn't matter what it is
[1217.92 - 1220.40] whether you got
[1218.64 - 1222.56] chronic fatigue syndrome or hashimoto's
[1220.40 - 1223.60] thyroiditis you really don't get a good
[1222.56 - 1225.68] chance to heal
[1223.60 - 1227.44] because you got a dairy product in you
[1225.68 - 1228.96] and the dairy product in you is sitting
[1227.44 - 1229.84] there and it's feeding all the different
[1228.96 - 1231.92] bugs
[1229.84 - 1235.12] and it's feeding them every single day
[1231.92 - 1236.80] and it takes days and days to get it out
[1235.12 - 1239.04] lynette says what about organic raw
[1236.80 - 1240.96] cheese that's the only dairy i give my
[1239.04 - 1243.76] kids
[1240.96 - 1244.48] look i look at it this way i look at it
[1243.76 - 1247.28] this way
[1244.48 - 1248.80] are the kids perfectly fine do they have
[1247.28 - 1250.64] any symptoms
[1248.80 - 1252.88] i get asked this by doctors all the time
[1250.64 - 1254.48] too and
[1252.88 - 1256.56] are the kids dealing with any kind of
[1254.48 - 1258.08] condition any kind of symptom
[1256.56 - 1260.08] so that's one thing right there so
[1258.08 - 1261.12] that's just we can we put that into
[1260.08 - 1262.48] consideration
[1261.12 - 1264.32] because it doesn't matter if your dairy
[1262.48 - 1266.08] is raw or your dairy is cooked your
[1264.32 - 1267.28] dairy is pasteurized
[1266.08 - 1269.12] it doesn't matter if your dairy has been
[1267.28 - 1270.00] heated up in the oven doesn't matter if
[1269.12 - 1273.04] your dairy is just
[1270.00 - 1275.60] raw dairy it's still gonna feed
[1273.04 - 1276.96] any bugs or pathogens so if kids have
[1275.60 - 1279.68] rashes skin conditions
[1276.96 - 1280.56] eczema psoriasis whether they got some
[1279.68 - 1282.40] adhd
[1280.56 - 1283.60] or they got some brain fog because kids
[1282.40 - 1286.64] have brain fog
[1283.60 - 1287.60] we don't call it brain fog with kids we
[1286.64 - 1290.48] don't call it
[1287.60 - 1291.68] we'll call it like attention you know
[1290.48 - 1294.80] drifting off
[1291.68 - 1295.76] and you know behavioral issues or
[1294.80 - 1299.36] something and
[1295.76 - 1300.48] we'll call it that and so it all depends
[1299.36 - 1301.36] on what kind of symptoms are your
[1300.48 - 1302.88] children
[1301.36 - 1304.96] exhibiting what about their teeth that's
[1302.88 - 1308.00] another one too so
[1304.96 - 1310.56] are your children's teeth
[1308.00 - 1312.56] or your children's teeth are they having
[1310.56 - 1315.12] problems are the new teeth growing in
[1312.56 - 1318.00] are the baby teeth problematic were the
[1315.12 - 1320.64] baby teeth
[1318.00 - 1322.40] rotting where the baby teeth getting
[1320.64 - 1325.28] cavities
[1322.40 - 1326.48] where the baby teeth being pulled had to
[1325.28 - 1328.88] be pulled
[1326.48 - 1329.68] what's going on with the baby teeth and
[1328.88 - 1331.44] then the
[1329.68 - 1333.20] new teeth coming in what's happening
[1331.44 - 1333.76] with those teeth so that's a big one
[1333.20 - 1336.88] right there
[1333.76 - 1338.56] so if you have you have a child that
[1336.88 - 1339.92] has teeth problems or a baby that has
[1338.56 - 1341.36] teeth problems where the teeth are
[1339.92 - 1342.48] coming in and we've got all these teeth
[1341.36 - 1345.20] issues
[1342.48 - 1346.96] then raw cheese isn't going to be a good
[1345.20 - 1349.28] one because
[1346.96 - 1351.52] that's how we lose our calcium too so we
[1349.28 - 1353.20] lose our bones that way
[1351.52 - 1356.48] so we'll talk about this right it's
[1353.20 - 1359.68] actually a good segue into this here
[1356.48 - 1361.36] so when mommy's really really acidic and
[1359.68 - 1362.56] she's eating dairy and she's eating
[1361.36 - 1364.88] cheese
[1362.56 - 1365.84] she's losing all of her calcium that's
[1364.88 - 1368.88] the calcium
[1365.84 - 1372.80] the baby uses so the baby
[1368.88 - 1376.72] get the baby's calcium comes from mom
[1372.80 - 1378.80] having spare calcium spear calcium like
[1376.72 - 1381.20] calcium that's derived from
[1378.80 - 1383.68] fruits vegetables anything else that she
[1381.20 - 1385.76] eats wild foods if she ever eats that
[1383.68 - 1386.72] any kind of herbs if she ever takes any
[1385.76 - 1388.32] kind of herbs
[1386.72 - 1389.76] throughout her life right so that
[1388.32 - 1391.68] calcium disappears
[1389.76 - 1392.96] if everybody's acidic if mom's really
[1391.68 - 1394.80] acidic
[1392.96 - 1396.16] margaret says my little one was born
[1394.80 - 1398.48] with rotting teeth
[1396.16 - 1400.72] she had to get four cavities at one
[1398.48 - 1404.56] years old
[1400.72 - 1408.56] four caps at one years old four caps
[1404.56 - 1410.64] so dr fine good to see you there
[1408.56 - 1412.16] basically what happens is that pregnant
[1410.64 - 1413.44] women are told to eat all the wrong
[1412.16 - 1416.56] stuff
[1413.44 - 1418.64] and that happens every day and then the
[1416.56 - 1419.36] baby's teeth are gonna be problematic
[1418.64 - 1421.60] because of that
[1419.36 - 1423.04] so pregnant moms are told to eat dairy
[1421.60 - 1424.32] and look there's a lot of pregnant
[1423.04 - 1427.20] pregnant moms out there
[1424.32 - 1429.76] they got their farms and they got their
[1427.20 - 1432.32] instagram page and youtube page
[1429.76 - 1434.32] and they live partially off the land and
[1432.32 - 1436.48] they have their own milk
[1434.32 - 1438.08] and they have their own butter they make
[1436.48 - 1439.60] their own butter
[1438.08 - 1441.44] and they're pregnant and they're giving
[1439.60 - 1442.40] it to their children and they're eating
[1441.44 - 1444.80] it and
[1442.40 - 1446.00] they may have had good calcium storage
[1444.80 - 1447.76] bins in them
[1446.00 - 1450.08] starting from their childhood from their
[1447.76 - 1451.28] mom they may have good calcium storage
[1450.08 - 1453.20] bins maybe they don't have a lot of
[1451.28 - 1455.68] toxic heavy metals in their system
[1453.20 - 1456.80] because that takes away our calcium too
[1455.68 - 1459.12] it interferes
[1456.80 - 1461.44] but all that cheese and that milk and
[1459.12 - 1463.84] that dairy regardless of it being
[1461.44 - 1466.32] not like all natural where it's on a
[1463.84 - 1467.04] farm it's raw versus pasteurized either
[1466.32 - 1469.12] way
[1467.04 - 1470.96] it's going to require that you lose all
[1469.12 - 1473.36] that calcium inside
[1470.96 - 1474.40] your bones you lose that inside your
[1473.36 - 1476.56] bloodstream
[1474.40 - 1478.56] over time and so when you're pregnant
[1476.56 - 1480.80] what happens to a lot of babies
[1478.56 - 1482.88] so when mom's pregnant she's eating all
[1480.80 - 1484.08] that dairy or ate all that dairy before
[1482.88 - 1487.28] her pregnancy
[1484.08 - 1489.04] and there's a real serious acidic
[1487.28 - 1490.96] environment going on
[1489.04 - 1492.64] and then the calcium is not available
[1490.96 - 1494.80] for the baby
[1492.64 - 1496.48] so teeth suffer when calcium's not
[1494.80 - 1499.60] available teeth suffer
[1496.48 - 1501.52] so in infants that's where we we end up
[1499.60 - 1503.12] with the teeth problems
[1501.52 - 1504.80] we end up going into that direction
[1503.12 - 1506.16] right there
[1504.80 - 1508.72] so let's go let's keep on talking about
[1506.16 - 1508.72] some other stuff
[1509.76 - 1514.32] so when we're doing our foods when we
[1512.96 - 1516.56] when we're doing our foods
[1514.32 - 1517.44] like our donuts our cakes or cookies our
[1516.56 - 1520.48] cheese
[1517.44 - 1522.72] our milk our butter
[1520.48 - 1524.00] we're creating this acid environment
[1522.72 - 1525.36] from all of it
[1524.00 - 1526.80] and that's not the only place we have
[1525.36 - 1528.72] the acid environment we have it from
[1526.80 - 1529.44] other places too animal approach people
[1528.72 - 1531.92] who eat animal
[1529.44 - 1533.12] protein i always tell them that they
[1531.92 - 1535.28] need to balance it
[1533.12 - 1537.36] where's your leafy greens because if you
[1535.28 - 1538.96] just do your animal protein
[1537.36 - 1540.64] you're doing your animal protein and you
[1538.96 - 1542.48] only do a little bit of broccoli you
[1540.64 - 1544.32] only do some green beans you only do a
[1542.48 - 1546.16] little lettuce here and there
[1544.32 - 1547.36] you only do some cauliflower rice here
[1546.16 - 1548.80] and there but you're doing your animal
[1547.36 - 1550.24] proteins
[1548.80 - 1552.96] you're gonna get yourself in trouble
[1550.24 - 1555.76] eventually because
[1552.96 - 1557.12] you need to be buffering that with
[1555.76 - 1558.16] something else the leafy greens are
[1557.12 - 1560.56] critical
[1558.16 - 1561.60] so the leafy greens are so important
[1560.56 - 1563.20] right there
[1561.60 - 1565.04] and what people don't realize is that
[1563.20 - 1566.56] not enough people not not
[1565.04 - 1568.84] people are not eating enough leafy
[1566.56 - 1570.16] greens they're not balancing that acid
[1568.84 - 1572.24] environment
[1570.16 - 1574.40] and then there's all the fats so then we
[1572.24 - 1575.92] got all that fat in the diet so that's a
[1574.40 - 1578.08] whole other problem all on its own
[1575.92 - 1579.04] so whether you're plant-based and you're
[1578.08 - 1580.88] vegan
[1579.04 - 1582.08] everybody's tanking the fats right i
[1580.88 - 1583.44] always say you guys are fatting
[1582.08 - 1585.36] themselves to death they're fatting
[1583.44 - 1587.36] themselves to death
[1585.36 - 1589.12] and as they're doing that that's a whole
[1587.36 - 1589.60] other problem all on its own because
[1589.12 - 1592.80] that's
[1589.60 - 1594.56] acidic so you can be like hey i'm vegan
[1592.80 - 1596.48] i'm plant-based i don't do the dairy
[1594.56 - 1599.44] products i'm in the pocket right here
[1596.48 - 1600.64] aw is going to let me off the hook i'm
[1599.44 - 1602.88] totally cool
[1600.64 - 1604.64] let's let the back to the landers be
[1602.88 - 1605.04] eating they're churning their own butter
[1604.64 - 1607.92] and
[1605.04 - 1608.96] drinking their raw milk let other people
[1607.92 - 1610.88] be eating their
[1608.96 - 1612.16] store-bought cheese and stop
[1610.88 - 1613.04] store-bought dairy that's been
[1612.16 - 1615.36] pasteurized
[1613.04 - 1616.72] i'm off the hook i'm vegan i'm off the
[1615.36 - 1618.72] hook i'm plant-based
[1616.72 - 1620.64] i don't have any problem at all that's
[1618.72 - 1622.24] not true if you're taking the almond
[1620.64 - 1623.92] butter the peanut butter
[1622.24 - 1625.60] if you're eating too many walnuts eating
[1623.92 - 1626.64] too many seeds pumpkin seeds sunflower
[1625.60 - 1628.80] seeds every single day
[1626.64 - 1630.80] if you're having too much oil and that
[1628.80 - 1633.20] oil gets away from us all the time
[1630.80 - 1634.88] if you're eating too many avocados if
[1633.20 - 1638.72] you're doing all of this
[1634.88 - 1642.40] all of that is acid it's all acid
[1638.72 - 1645.84] fatty acids essential
[1642.40 - 1646.32] fatty acids you're doing all your olive
[1645.84 - 1649.20] oil
[1646.32 - 1650.32] olive oil is acidic as heck really
[1649.20 - 1653.36] really acidic
[1650.32 - 1654.32] and it's acidic inside the body really
[1653.36 - 1655.76] important to know
[1654.32 - 1657.44] that people don't realize that they're
[1655.76 - 1658.88] like wait a minute that's not acid
[1657.44 - 1661.28] that's not acid
[1658.88 - 1663.68] so we get this acidic environment when
[1661.28 - 1665.36] we're tanking the fats
[1663.68 - 1667.28] so what we do is we grow up we're
[1665.36 - 1669.20] usually eating all the milk cheese
[1667.28 - 1670.48] butter we're doing all the comfort foods
[1669.20 - 1672.00] we're doing all the vice
[1670.48 - 1673.60] foods we were talking about vices
[1672.00 - 1676.64] earlier
[1673.60 - 1677.28] we're doing all these comfort foods and
[1676.64 - 1680.00] then
[1677.28 - 1681.28] even when we go healthy or we're eating
[1680.00 - 1683.84] healthier
[1681.28 - 1686.08] we're still doing all the fat which is
[1683.84 - 1688.96] acidic so we're basically living in this
[1686.08 - 1690.72] acidic environment our urine stinks when
[1688.96 - 1692.56] it shouldn't stink
[1690.72 - 1695.92] because that's a whole other thing is
[1692.56 - 1697.20] people's pee isn't supposed to smell
[1695.92 - 1699.68] rancid
[1697.20 - 1700.88] and awful like people's pee is not
[1699.68 - 1702.64] supposed to smell
[1700.88 - 1705.04] urine is actually not supposed to have
[1702.64 - 1707.68] such an intense smell at all
[1705.04 - 1708.64] but that urine is all acids so it's
[1707.68 - 1712.00] everybody just
[1708.64 - 1714.80] peeing that acid out urine is not
[1712.00 - 1717.12] supposed to be yellow
[1714.80 - 1719.28] you know it's not supposed to be yellow
[1717.12 - 1721.52] and it's not supposed to smell
[1719.28 - 1723.28] just so you guys know it's supposed to
[1721.52 - 1725.76] be a light faint smell
[1723.28 - 1726.40] and it's not supposed to be yellow all
[1725.76 - 1728.96] that is
[1726.40 - 1731.28] acids pouring out of us our minerals in
[1728.96 - 1734.48] our body pouring out of us
[1731.28 - 1736.00] that's what that is and
[1734.48 - 1737.52] if you start eating really healthy
[1736.00 - 1738.80] you're doing like the morning cleanse
[1737.52 - 1740.16] you're taking care of yourself you're
[1738.80 - 1742.00] juicing your celery juice and you still
[1740.16 - 1744.16] have stinky pee
[1742.00 - 1746.48] and it's really yellow now you're
[1744.16 - 1748.32] cleansing out old stuff
[1746.48 - 1751.68] you're cleansing out old stuff that was
[1748.32 - 1753.52] built inside of you for years
[1751.68 - 1755.20] what helps the acidic body what helps to
[1753.52 - 1756.64] heal that
[1755.20 - 1757.92] well i'm not going to say fruits and
[1756.64 - 1758.40] vegetables because that's not going to
[1757.92 - 1760.96] do it
[1758.40 - 1762.00] it's not enough you need powerful herbal
[1760.96 - 1764.64] extractions
[1762.00 - 1766.72] like the celery juice so whether you get
[1764.64 - 1768.96] a juicer down the road whether you get
[1766.72 - 1770.72] some other juicer down the road whether
[1768.96 - 1772.64] you have a juicer
[1770.72 - 1774.64] and you're using it whatever that one is
[1772.64 - 1778.24] that is a powerful
[1774.64 - 1780.40] medical tool and that's one way
[1778.24 - 1781.52] of reclaiming your health back and
[1780.40 - 1784.88] balancing that
[1781.52 - 1787.68] stopping the assets from injuring
[1784.88 - 1788.72] and taking from you like neutralizing
[1787.68 - 1791.28] those assets
[1788.72 - 1793.20] neutralizing those acids people who got
[1791.28 - 1796.00] eczema psoriasis skin problems health
[1793.20 - 1800.08] conditions you're really really acidic
[1796.00 - 1801.28] asparagus produces a smell sandra
[1800.08 - 1803.12] yeah because it's got a chemical
[1801.28 - 1805.52] compound that does that
[1803.12 - 1806.72] so asparagus has a chemical compound
[1805.52 - 1810.48] inside
[1806.72 - 1812.96] of it that is creating that smell
[1810.48 - 1814.96] so that's what asparagus is it's not
[1812.96 - 1817.52] it's not causing it's not that doesn't
[1814.96 - 1820.80] mean you're acidic but asparagus is
[1817.52 - 1822.16] really cleansing it's very cleansing
[1820.80 - 1824.64] if you're eating enough of it you're
[1822.16 - 1826.72] going to be cleansing your system
[1824.64 - 1828.72] cleansing your system we have so much
[1826.72 - 1830.64] stuff built inside our liver spilled
[1828.72 - 1834.16] inside of us we have so much
[1830.64 - 1836.08] junk and garbage we have acid stored in
[1834.16 - 1838.00] places we have salt deposits
[1836.08 - 1839.52] that shouldn't be inside our body stored
[1838.00 - 1841.44] in places
[1839.52 - 1844.16] we have deposits of pesticides
[1841.44 - 1847.04] herbicides fungicides toxic heavy metals
[1844.16 - 1848.16] solvents household cleaners we have
[1847.04 - 1851.52] fragrances
[1848.16 - 1854.64] inside of us fragrances inside of us
[1851.52 - 1856.72] i recently talked to a surgeon who has a
[1854.64 - 1859.20] really good sense of smell incredible
[1856.72 - 1862.48] sense of smell doesn't use fragrances
[1859.20 - 1867.04] never uses fragrances and even
[1862.48 - 1869.76] opted in in or to change the chemicals
[1867.04 - 1870.72] that they use to a chemical that didn't
[1869.76 - 1875.04] smell as much
[1870.72 - 1876.88] in the or so and this surgeon
[1875.04 - 1878.56] told me that because the the surgeon
[1876.88 - 1881.28] doesn't use the fabric softeners
[1878.56 - 1882.96] doesn't use all the different fragrances
[1881.28 - 1884.24] doesn't use the chemicals doesn't use
[1882.96 - 1886.08] chemical cleaners
[1884.24 - 1888.32] conventional cleaners doesn't use
[1886.08 - 1890.32] cologne or perfume no air fresheners
[1888.32 - 1893.84] doesn't burn scented candles
[1890.32 - 1895.04] this surgeon said that the smell of
[1893.84 - 1897.44] patients
[1895.04 - 1898.08] when they're saturated in scented
[1897.44 - 1899.84] candles
[1898.08 - 1901.68] on their skin from their house when
[1899.84 - 1903.28] they're saturated with air fresheners
[1901.68 - 1905.36] from their house when they're saturated
[1903.28 - 1908.48] with all this the smell of it when
[1905.36 - 1909.60] the surgeon cuts the patient open the
[1908.48 - 1911.20] smell
[1909.60 - 1913.84] it's the first time i've had a surgeon
[1911.20 - 1915.60] ever tell me that and confirm
[1913.84 - 1917.60] what spirit of compassion's information
[1915.60 - 1919.76] is that that
[1917.60 - 1921.68] you can actually smell the inside of
[1919.76 - 1923.20] their body and smell the air fresheners
[1921.68 - 1924.72] and smell the scented candles from the
[1923.20 - 1927.84] inside of the body
[1924.72 - 1928.88] and so the surgeon said that because he
[1927.84 - 1931.20] removed
[1928.88 - 1932.96] everything everything in his life
[1931.20 - 1934.00] whereas house doesn't smell like any
[1932.96 - 1937.20] chemical cleaners
[1934.00 - 1939.36] his nose got really really sharp super
[1937.20 - 1941.92] super sharp you guys
[1939.36 - 1942.80] so sharp every time he cuts open a
[1941.92 - 1944.88] patient
[1942.80 - 1946.64] he just doesn't smell all the toxins
[1944.88 - 1949.36] inside the body which is what
[1946.64 - 1950.96] which has got that real gas that ammonia
[1949.36 - 1952.40] comes out of people when you cut people
[1950.96 - 1955.60] open
[1952.40 - 1958.72] on the table right for surgery
[1955.60 - 1960.48] ammonia just comes right out of them all
[1958.72 - 1962.40] that rotting petrified flat
[1960.48 - 1963.60] uh flesh that they've eaten that's in
[1962.40 - 1966.16] their guts
[1963.60 - 1968.00] all the acids that are in their blood
[1966.16 - 1969.68] all the fat that's in their blood that
[1968.00 - 1970.88] went rancid because it's floating around
[1969.68 - 1973.28] their blood every day because they're
[1970.88 - 1976.00] eating nothing but fats every single day
[1973.28 - 1977.76] when you cut open a patient the stink
[1976.00 - 1980.00] comes out of them
[1977.76 - 1980.88] it's it's it's awful right well the
[1980.00 - 1982.88] surgeon now
[1980.88 - 1985.44] can smell it's not just that stink but
[1982.88 - 1988.40] the air fresheners come out of people
[1985.44 - 1990.88] so the air freshener coming out the
[1988.40 - 1994.24] scented candles coming out
[1990.88 - 1996.00] and that's what the surgeon can smell
[1994.24 - 1997.92] so it's really incredible when you think
[1996.00 - 1999.84] about it so when people are doing all
[1997.92 - 2001.52] this scented candles that's inside their
[1999.84 - 2003.12] bloodstream that's inside their liver
[2001.52 - 2004.56] that's circulating inside of them we're
[2003.12 - 2005.84] doing the air fresheners every single
[2004.56 - 2007.20] day i tell people pull those air
[2005.84 - 2008.96] fresheners out
[2007.20 - 2011.12] people should be complaining to every
[2008.96 - 2013.28] single clothing company
[2011.12 - 2015.92] that sends anything that reeks but the
[2013.28 - 2018.40] problem is people don't even smell
[2015.92 - 2020.00] the new clothes reeking with air
[2018.40 - 2021.04] fresheners and the factories and the
[2020.00 - 2023.04] warehouses
[2021.04 - 2024.80] with all that smell the chemicals on the
[2023.04 - 2026.32] clothes people don't complain because
[2024.80 - 2028.00] they can't smell it because they already
[2026.32 - 2030.08] have it inside their house
[2028.00 - 2031.84] everything stinks inside their house
[2030.08 - 2033.20] it's all the chemical cleaners
[2031.84 - 2037.60] conventional cleaners
[2033.20 - 2040.96] detergents fabric softeners
[2037.60 - 2042.56] so m tribe says
[2040.96 - 2044.32] but how are people living off the
[2042.56 - 2048.40] typical american diet
[2044.32 - 2050.00] it seems like nothing is wrong well look
[2048.40 - 2051.76] there are people on the typical american
[2050.00 - 2053.92] diet right but they end up sick
[2051.76 - 2054.96] they just end up sick later no one gets
[2053.92 - 2056.72] sick
[2054.96 - 2058.72] everybody gets sick with something i
[2056.72 - 2061.28] talk to people that are on the typical
[2058.72 - 2062.80] american diet sav and they've had
[2061.28 - 2063.76] surgeries but yeah they're fine
[2062.80 - 2064.64] afterwards
[2063.76 - 2066.08] they you know they've had their
[2064.64 - 2066.88] gallbladder taken out now they're back
[2066.08 - 2068.56] in action
[2066.88 - 2070.24] they've had panics removed now they're
[2068.56 - 2071.92] back back in action
[2070.24 - 2073.44] they've had some other type of surgery
[2071.92 - 2075.68] now they're back in action
[2073.44 - 2076.96] or they get sick later with chronic
[2075.68 - 2078.48] illness they end up
[2076.96 - 2080.24] feeding their pathogens they end up
[2078.48 - 2081.92] picking up a new pathogen they end up
[2080.24 - 2085.60] picking up a new epstein bar
[2081.92 - 2088.56] or or a shingles um
[2085.60 - 2089.68] ore or strep or something they pick
[2088.56 - 2092.48] something up
[2089.68 - 2094.24] and it finally tips the scale or
[2092.48 - 2096.16] whatever's been incubating inside of
[2094.24 - 2097.44] them they're fc bar for 20 30 years if
[2096.16 - 2100.56] they don't have an aggressive one
[2097.44 - 2103.12] finally it takes over or the stress plus
[2100.56 - 2104.64] the eff the fight or flight the caffeine
[2103.12 - 2106.08] finally takes over
[2104.64 - 2108.00] all the vinegar they've done all these
[2106.08 - 2109.52] years starts to break apart their teeth
[2108.00 - 2111.44] now they're in the dentist chair all the
[2109.52 - 2114.72] time getting dental work it hits all at
[2111.44 - 2116.32] once so many times like that with
[2114.72 - 2118.64] but the think about people like hey
[2116.32 - 2121.60] those people can eat what they want
[2118.64 - 2123.04] they eventually get sick and go down
[2121.60 - 2124.16] they eventually do
[2123.04 - 2126.00] and we're in a place where that's
[2124.16 - 2127.52] happening more than ever somebody says
[2126.00 - 2130.64] do celery do you support
[2127.52 - 2131.84] autoimmune diseases it supports it in
[2130.64 - 2133.76] the right direction
[2131.84 - 2135.92] it doesn't support the auto autoimmune
[2133.76 - 2138.08] disease to stay there
[2135.92 - 2139.76] so so what you'll see out there is all
[2138.08 - 2141.92] these things out there support
[2139.76 - 2144.24] autoimmune that's what they do apple
[2141.92 - 2147.36] cider vinegar supports autoimmune
[2144.24 - 2148.72] in keeping it there forever vinegar
[2147.36 - 2151.60] supports it
[2148.72 - 2153.28] caffeine supports caffeine supports your
[2151.60 - 2155.36] autoimmune disease
[2153.28 - 2157.68] in the opposite direction making it
[2155.36 - 2160.40] worse or keeping it there forever
[2157.68 - 2161.52] it doesn't support it getting you out of
[2160.40 - 2163.84] autoimmune disease
[2161.52 - 2165.36] caffeine doesn't pull you out of
[2163.84 - 2167.28] autoimmune disease
[2165.36 - 2169.12] the vices don't pull you out of
[2167.28 - 2171.12] autoimmune we keep our autoimmune you
[2169.12 - 2172.40] have sushi you keep your autoimmune
[2171.12 - 2173.92] you have some donuts you have
[2172.40 - 2175.60] gluten-free donuts you keep your
[2173.92 - 2177.04] autoimmune you have vegan donuts you
[2175.60 - 2179.20] keep your autoimmune
[2177.04 - 2180.08] you keep it there you have your burgers
[2179.20 - 2181.76] you have
[2180.08 - 2183.20] you can be in a vegan restaurant and
[2181.76 - 2184.48] still have one of those bean burgers or
[2183.20 - 2185.68] something like that but the amount of
[2184.48 - 2186.00] crap that's in there and the amount of
[2185.68 - 2187.92] fat
[2186.00 - 2189.68] that's in there and the msg that's
[2187.92 - 2190.48] hidden in there and the canola oil and
[2189.68 - 2193.52] anything else
[2190.48 - 2196.88] you're still keeping your autoimmune
[2193.52 - 2198.08] and so we end up keeping that autoimmune
[2196.88 - 2200.56] around forever
[2198.08 - 2203.12] celery juice helps take us out of that
[2200.56 - 2205.44] it helps to take you out of autoimmune
[2203.12 - 2207.12] eczema psoriasis that's an autoimmune

[2296.00 - 2299.20] i'm going to juice some celery now you
[2297.20 - 2301.28] guys so
[2299.20 - 2302.88] it's important to know these things
[2301.28 - 2305.04] about getting out of that acid
[2302.88 - 2307.60] environment we can talk a good game we
[2305.04 - 2309.28] can talk about assets and alkaline but
[2307.60 - 2310.96] if we don't know really anything about
[2309.28 - 2312.56] it how can we do that so if you
[2310.96 - 2314.88] if you're hearing information from
[2312.56 - 2316.32] so-called health experts that know about
[2314.88 - 2319.28] alkalinity
[2316.32 - 2320.40] and acidity body being acidic and
[2319.28 - 2321.60] they're telling you to have all your
[2320.40 - 2323.04] avocados
[2321.60 - 2325.20] they're telling you to have you know all
[2323.04 - 2326.00] your your healthy fats you're telling
[2325.20 - 2327.04] you can have your peanut
[2326.00 - 2329.28] butter they're telling you all these
[2327.04 - 2331.12] things your olive oil
[2329.28 - 2334.24] and they're pushing it they're telling
[2331.12 - 2336.24] you can have your lean proteins
[2334.24 - 2337.60] that it's not that you can't have any of
[2336.24 - 2338.96] that but if you're sick and you're
[2337.60 - 2340.64] struggling with a symptom or you got
[2338.96 - 2342.56] eczema you got psoriasis
[2340.64 - 2344.48] you have something that you want to get
[2342.56 - 2345.04] rid of you have to bring down the fats
[2344.48 - 2348.16] because
[2345.04 - 2351.12] the fats are acidic it's all acid
[2348.16 - 2352.48] that's what the fats are it's fatty
[2351.12 - 2356.64] acids
[2352.48 - 2359.12] that's what the fats are it's all acidic
[2356.64 - 2360.56] so we have to learn how to bring down
[2359.12 - 2362.16] those fats
[2360.56 - 2364.00] but first things first what kind of
[2362.16 - 2367.04] vices do you have that's not
[2364.00 - 2368.88] fats like do you have fats plus
[2367.04 - 2370.32] other stuff like are you doing the
[2368.88 - 2372.16] cheeseburgers are you doing the pizzas a
[2370.32 - 2372.96] lot are you doing all the eggs fried

[2380.72 - 2384.08] vices
[2381.76 - 2385.76] you have to learn to take them out and
[2384.08 - 2386.16] you're not a bad person if you keep them

[2402.88 - 2406.32] vices

[2406.32 - 2411.20] somebody who used to come to me for help
[2408.32 - 2412.80] 30 years ago reached out and said
[2411.20 - 2415.68] they're still doing
[2412.80 - 2417.52] still doing all the good stuff and

[2426.24 - 2431.28] start at the third day of juicing celery
[2428.72 - 2434.40] is that incredible
[2431.28 - 2435.12] that's absolutely incredible really
[2434.40 - 2436.64] really is
[2435.12 - 2439.04] and i'm so proud of you by the way so
[2436.64 - 2440.16] proud of you just moving some stuff over
[2439.04 - 2443.60] you guys
[2440.16 - 2443.60] let's juice a little celery now
[2445.28 - 2453.44] we're coming to the end of the sale with
[2448.16 - 2455.60] the mm-900 just letting you guys know
[2453.44 - 2457.68] best protocol for chronic yeast
[2455.60 - 2460.80] infections
[2457.68 - 2462.56] this is one part of it right here what
[2460.80 - 2465.60] is a chronic yeast infection
[2462.56 - 2468.88] what is it is it yeast right
[2465.60 - 2471.28] no it's not it's not just yeast
[2468.88 - 2472.48] yeast is just present with a chronic
[2471.28 - 2474.30] yeast infection
[2472.48 - 2476.56] it's just present
[2474.30 - 2479.60] [Applause]
[2476.56 - 2483.76] a yeast infection is streptococcus
[2479.60 - 2486.08] it's strep bacteria behind everything
[2483.76 - 2487.04] and that's why the yeast infection stays
[2486.08 - 2489.28] chronic
[2487.04 - 2490.64] because there's a bacterial infection
[2489.28 - 2492.72] behind there
[2490.64 - 2495.92] and the reason why people get rid of
[2492.72 - 2498.08] their yeast bacterial infections
[2495.92 - 2499.28] with celery juice is because celery
[2498.08 - 2503.12] juice kills the
[2499.28 - 2505.04] streptococcus bacteria behind the yeast
[2503.12 - 2506.64] that's why so it kills the strep
[2505.04 - 2509.84] bacteria behind the yeast
[2506.64 - 2509.84] important to know
[2511.36 - 2517.12] celery juice is no joke it's an herbal
[2514.40 - 2519.60] medicine so you're witnessing an herbal
[2517.12 - 2519.60] medicine
[2519.84 - 2526.24] eating celery sticks is not enough
[2523.68 - 2527.28] it's not enough you guys and if you're
[2526.24 - 2529.60] somebody who's
[2527.28 - 2531.28] on your vices still you're doing your
[2529.60 - 2533.04] caffeine you're doing your chocolate

[2542.96 - 2545.92] you know when you count the squares
[2544.40 - 2546.88] right here it's one two three and then
[2545.92 - 2550.48] one two three four
[2546.88 - 2553.76] five six so you got three across
[2550.48 - 2558.40] you need four across 24 squares
[2553.76 - 2560.16] that's 24 cuts 24 cuts

[2566.24 - 2572.72] by a great a great healer
[2569.12 - 2576.00] look into those herbs look into them
[2572.72 - 2577.44] what fillers are there is there alcohol
[2576.00 - 2579.12] in your tinctures
[2577.44 - 2580.88] that's what i love about the vimergy
[2579.12 - 2583.04] stuff there's no
[2580.88 - 2585.04] alcohol but it's even better than that
[2583.04 - 2585.36] there's no junk no fillers hidden in
[2585.04 - 2588.00] there
[2585.36 - 2590.56] no msg hidden in there and so that's the
[2588.00 - 2593.92] vimergy licorice root right there
[2590.56 - 2597.68] that's the dimmer to cat's claw so
[2593.92 - 2602.08] what tools are you guys using to counter
[2597.68 - 2604.80] counter the the cuts to counter the acid
[2602.08 - 2606.56] look i don't i don't expect anybody to
[2604.80 - 2608.40] do at all
[2606.56 - 2609.84] unless they get there and they just
[2608.40 - 2611.04] they're so tired of being sick and they
[2609.84 - 2613.76] need to go further because they're
[2611.04 - 2613.76] really sick
[2615.52 - 2621.92] i just basically i'm just in that
[2619.20 - 2624.08] place of what are you doing what can we
[2621.92 - 2624.08] do
[2624.24 - 2627.76] you know how many people say they're on
[2625.68 - 2629.60] the mm diet you know how many people say
[2627.76 - 2631.12] they're on the medical medium diet
[2629.60 - 2633.04] or medical median protocol but they're
[2631.12 - 2634.88] doing chocolate caffeine
[2633.04 - 2639.04] they're doing matcha tea they're doing
[2634.88 - 2641.76] lots of fat which is acid straight acid
[2639.04 - 2642.88] even if they're vegan i noticed people
[2641.76 - 2646.48] throughout the years
[2642.88 - 2648.48] they've gone vegan not because of
[2646.48 - 2650.00] medical medium necessarily
[2648.48 - 2652.08] because they're following some vegan
[2650.00 - 2653.04] doctors but then they turn around and
[2652.08 - 2656.16] they don't say
[2653.04 - 2658.56] hey i'm doing the vegan doctor the the
[2656.16 - 2660.40] vegan doctor author's diet they say
[2658.56 - 2662.88] i'm doing the medical medium diet it's
[2660.40 - 2664.16] not working
[2662.88 - 2665.76] they're not even doing the medical
[2664.16 - 2667.44] medium diet they're not doing medical
[2665.76 - 2672.08] medium anything
[2667.44 - 2674.48] i see that all the time all the time
[2672.08 - 2676.48] how many natural flavors are people
[2674.48 - 2678.08] consuming what kind of natural flavors
[2676.48 - 2680.40] that's all msg
[2678.08 - 2681.84] what about the nutritional yeast what
[2680.40 - 2685.84] about that
[2681.84 - 2688.32] nutritional yeast and then the vinegars
[2685.84 - 2690.48] how many vinegars are you using if you
[2688.32 - 2691.76] have sushi if you have vegan sushi it's
[2690.48 - 2695.36] vinegar
[2691.76 - 2697.92] i can't tell you how many people
[2695.36 - 2699.36] go with their friends to get sushi and
[2697.92 - 2702.80] they get the fish free
[2699.36 - 2706.64] sushi meaning no tuna and it's
[2702.80 - 2708.24] loaded with vinegar and they think
[2706.64 - 2711.28] they think that they're all good and
[2708.24 - 2711.28] it's loaded with vinegar
[2712.00 - 2714.96] then they'll just say they're still
[2713.12 - 2716.24] doing the mm they're doing the mm
[2714.96 - 2718.24] protocol
[2716.24 - 2719.68] and they're not getting better so people
[2718.24 - 2720.80] will do that all the time
[2719.68 - 2723.52] and they're not even on the right
[2720.80 - 2726.08] supplements it's like yeah i took a zinc
[2723.52 - 2727.84] well not really if you're taking a zinc
[2726.08 - 2728.56] with all the citric acid in it and all
[2727.84 - 2729.68] the other crap
[2728.56 - 2732.08] in there and all the fillers if you're
[2729.68 - 2733.68] not doing like the vimergy zinc or one
[2732.08 - 2735.20] comparable which i haven't found one
[2733.68 - 2736.40] comparable but you can use whatever your
[2735.20 - 2738.08] doctor tells you you know do what your
[2736.40 - 2741.36] doctor says
[2738.08 - 2743.36] narasini good to see you but all these
[2741.36 - 2745.20] things matter so how many mm tools and
[2743.36 - 2748.96] where are we going with the tools like
[2745.20 - 2748.96] are we really using the mm tools
[2749.28 - 2754.16] the juicer is a critical medical medium
[2753.20 - 2755.52] tool
[2754.16 - 2757.68] and if you have your own juicer it's
[2755.52 - 2760.16] different than this use it that's
[2757.68 - 2761.60] a medical medium tool if you're using
[2760.16 - 2762.88] some other juicer out there it's a
[2761.60 - 2764.80] medical medium toll
[2762.88 - 2766.72] because if you need to use it as an
[2764.80 - 2768.64] herbal extractor
[2766.72 - 2770.32] and you need to extract that herbal
[2768.64 - 2774.24] medicine
[2770.32 - 2776.96] i just juiced all the celery juice right
[2774.24 - 2777.60] and that's that's all the pulp you guys
[2776.96 - 2779.84] right there
[2777.60 - 2781.12] that's it on tick tock check this guys
[2779.84 - 2783.68] check this out you guys
[2781.12 - 2785.20] it's in between two fingers look and
[2783.68 - 2788.48] it's dry
[2785.20 - 2790.08] it's dry that's the pulp if i squeeze it
[2788.48 - 2793.04] into a little ball
[2790.08 - 2794.80] this is incredible right here this is
[2793.04 - 2795.68] the most i've ever seen it get to this
[2794.80 - 2798.40] point
[2795.68 - 2798.96] that's it right there it's a little ball
[2798.40 - 2802.16] in my
[2798.96 - 2805.92] fingers you guys see that
[2802.16 - 2807.76] this is dry and that's a ball between my
[2805.92 - 2810.24] fingers i'm actually kind of blown away
[2807.76 - 2813.04] like i don't know how this even happened
[2810.24 - 2814.08] to this degree this is the best i've
[2813.04 - 2815.92] ever seen
[2814.08 - 2817.12] my juicer ever do and it always does
[2815.92 - 2820.48] great
[2817.12 - 2825.04] uh i'm holding between my two fingers
[2820.48 - 2827.68] this tiny little ball of dried pulp
[2825.04 - 2830.48] and that is what i'm talking about right
[2827.68 - 2833.12] there about the mm-900 hds
[2830.48 - 2834.64] it's 82 off it's almost 100 off and i
[2833.12 - 2836.08] hear people out there saying oh my god
[2834.64 - 2839.12] thank god i got it because i
[2836.08 - 2841.92] saved about basically 100 bucks and um
[2839.12 - 2843.84] and i got the mm-900 but it's the omega
[2841.92 - 2846.24] juicers.com you got to go there you guys
[2843.84 - 2849.44] omega juicers.com omega
[2846.24 - 2850.24] juicers.com gotta get the mm-900 hds
[2849.44 - 2851.52] because it's not any
[2850.24 - 2853.60] their their other juicers aren't going
[2851.52 - 2855.92] to do this they got juicers that look
[2853.60 - 2856.56] like this it's got to be the mm-900 hds
[2855.92 - 2858.64] it's not going to do
[2856.56 - 2859.68] what i'm doing this i can't even put
[2858.64 - 2862.32] this down because i don't even
[2859.68 - 2864.88] understand how this happened
[2862.32 - 2866.00] like that's the next level is what this
[2864.88 - 2870.00] is
[2866.00 - 2873.52] so i'm holding a tiny ball of dried pulp
[2870.00 - 2875.20] in between my fingers
[2873.52 - 2877.12] and that's how much juice i have right
[2875.20 - 2880.80] here
[2877.12 - 2886.40] i'm actually saving that right there
[2880.80 - 2888.16] be calling up my friends afterwards
[2886.40 - 2889.76] i mean it's always small and it's always
[2888.16 - 2892.72] dry but that was
[2889.76 - 2894.24] a whole other level so i'm doing a
[2892.72 - 2896.56] little straining right here straining
[2894.24 - 2899.04] the juice
[2896.56 - 2900.40] you have to strain your celery juice
[2899.04 - 2903.76] it's not going to work as good
[2900.40 - 2906.96] you have to strain it it's
[2903.76 - 2910.40] critical that you strain it it's giving
[2906.96 - 2915.12] everybody the 4-1-1 on that
[2910.40 - 2918.56] it's critical that you strain the juice
[2915.12 - 2921.20] so what medical tools are you guys
[2918.56 - 2922.32] using which medical devices are you
[2921.20 - 2924.88] using
[2922.32 - 2926.32] and people say well medical tools i got
[2924.88 - 2929.44] some crutches
[2926.32 - 2930.72] in the closet i got you know something
[2929.44 - 2933.84] else and i'm like okay
[2930.72 - 2934.88] a friend of mine's grandmother has a
[2933.84 - 2936.64] walker
[2934.88 - 2938.48] and i'm like i'm not talking about that
[2936.64 - 2940.24] medical that kind of medical tool
[2938.48 - 2941.28] you need the walker yes but what about
[2940.24 - 2942.96] something that's going to help so
[2941.28 - 2944.32] grandma can start walking again without
[2942.96 - 2946.48] the walker
[2944.32 - 2948.32] like we need to go into that direction
[2946.48 - 2950.08] like where's the medical tool
[2948.32 - 2952.24] in ecmo psoriasis i'll go into that a
[2950.08 - 2954.40] little bit celery juice
[2952.24 - 2956.24] is incredible because of what it does
[2954.40 - 2957.68] when someone has extra psoriasis
[2956.24 - 2959.84] so i just want to grab something real
[2957.68 - 2959.84] quick
[2960.40 - 2963.84] so when it comes down to when it comes
[2962.40 - 2967.84] down to someone getting
[2963.84 - 2971.84] eczema someone getting psoriasis
[2967.84 - 2971.84] so here's your liver right here
[2971.92 - 2977.36] that's your liver a right liver
[2975.84 - 2980.24] i should have wrote it back or actually
[2977.36 - 2982.00] you can see it so that's your liver
[2980.24 - 2983.76] if you got eczema you got psoriasis you
[2982.00 - 2986.40] got some kind of skin condition
[2983.76 - 2987.60] you even have acne there's bugs inside
[2986.40 - 2988.72] the liver
[2987.60 - 2991.60] when it comes down to eczema and
[2988.72 - 2994.48] psoriasis you got
[2991.60 - 2996.88] epstein-barr inside the liver rosacea
[2994.48 - 2998.80] too i've seen bar inside the liver
[2996.88 - 3001.76] when you have acne you've got
[2998.80 - 3003.92] streptococcus inside the liver
[3001.76 - 3005.36] your liver is a little bug holder it's
[3003.92 - 3007.92] the bug holder
[3005.36 - 3009.76] that's what your liver is it holds the
[3007.92 - 3012.48] bugs
[3009.76 - 3012.96] and those bugs start to feed off of
[3012.48 - 3016.08] stuff
[3012.96 - 3017.52] they feed off of toxic heavy metals so
[3016.08 - 3019.76] they feed off of those toxic heavy
[3017.52 - 3022.08] metals you're in medical medium school
[3019.76 - 3022.08] right now
[3022.32 - 3027.20] so you got the toxic heavy metals inside
[3024.08 - 3027.68] the liver and all those bugs feed off of
[3027.20 - 3029.60] that
[3027.68 - 3031.28] someone has eczema psoriasis the epstein
[3029.60 - 3033.20] bar feeds off of
[3031.28 - 3035.76] copper so that's what the epstein bar
[3033.20 - 3037.28] feeds off of
[3035.76 - 3040.48] so if you have epsilon bar inside the
[3037.28 - 3043.28] liver it's going to feed off of copper
[3040.48 - 3045.36] and then release a dermatoxin and that
[3043.28 - 3047.52] dermatoxin is released
[3045.36 - 3049.52] so we'll do a little dermatoxin coming
[3047.52 - 3050.96] out of here that's a dermatoxin swimming
[3049.52 - 3053.12] out of the liver
[3050.96 - 3054.48] it's heading up the highway it's getting
[3053.12 - 3058.56] into the bloodstream
[3054.48 - 3058.56] it's a derma dermatoxin right
[3058.96 - 3064.96] that's your dermatoxin that dermatoxin
[3062.48 - 3068.24] eventually finds its way to the skin
[3064.96 - 3069.60] and you end up with eczema or celery
[3068.24 - 3073.12] juice the reason why
[3069.60 - 3074.80] it's reversing tens of thousands of
[3073.12 - 3077.36] people's eczema for the good
[3074.80 - 3078.08] like for good re reversing eczema
[3077.36 - 3082.32] psoriasis
[3078.08 - 3083.36] for good forever it's because the celery
[3082.32 - 3086.24] juice
[3083.36 - 3087.52] is killing off the epstein bar inside
[3086.24 - 3090.00] the liver
[3087.52 - 3090.96] sodium cluster salts kill so the sodium
[3090.00 - 3092.48] remember i told you about the sodium
[3090.96 - 3096.08] cluster salts you got the macro
[3092.48 - 3096.64] sodium right the macro sodium inside the
[3096.08 - 3098.24] celery
[3096.64 - 3100.56] then you've got the subgroup sodium
[3098.24 - 3103.04] which is a little solar system
[3100.56 - 3105.12] that's your sodium cluster salts that's
[3103.04 - 3106.88] going around the sodium
[3105.12 - 3109.20] that's your medicine so when you do your
[3106.88 - 3112.80] herbal extraction you guys
[3109.20 - 3113.92] with your juicer even if it's not as
[3112.80 - 3115.92] good as this juicer
[3113.92 - 3117.20] it's not it's a crappy juicer bad juicer
[3115.92 - 3118.80] you're still doing a herbal extraction
[3117.20 - 3121.28] to some degree for sure
[3118.80 - 3122.08] when you do your herbal extraction
[3121.28 - 3124.72] you're taking
[3122.08 - 3125.52] that sodium cluster salt you're drinking
[3124.72 - 3127.68] it
[3125.52 - 3129.76] that's your herbal medicine so you're
[3127.68 - 3131.04] actually drinking consuming your herbal
[3129.76 - 3134.32] medicine
[3131.04 - 3136.24] and then that sodium cluster salt
[3134.32 - 3137.36] when that touches when it goes inside
[3136.24 - 3139.20] the liver
[3137.36 - 3140.56] cause here it goes goes inside the liver
[3139.20 - 3142.08] i don't know if this is actually working
[3140.56 - 3144.72] out but i think it is
[3142.08 - 3147.76] so the sodium cluster salt right there
[3144.72 - 3149.84] goes inside the liver
[3147.76 - 3151.36] right there goes inside the number it
[3149.84 - 3155.36] kills off the epstein bar
[3151.36 - 3157.36] so that no more dermatoxins come out
[3155.36 - 3158.88] of the liver no more dermatoxins come
[3157.36 - 3160.64] out
[3158.88 - 3162.40] so then your skin starts to heal your
[3160.64 - 3162.96] skin starts to heal your skin starts to
[3162.40 - 3164.56] heal
[3162.96 - 3165.76] some people have eczema syriza so bad
[3164.56 - 3167.04] and they have a stubborn epstein bar
[3165.76 - 3168.24] that they need to be doing some other
[3167.04 - 3171.28] things like i talked about in the
[3168.24 - 3173.60] medical medium books
[3171.28 - 3175.44] and the new edition medical medium new
[3173.60 - 3175.84] edition revised and expanded it's on
[3175.44 - 3178.00] sale
[3175.84 - 3178.96] amazon.com you might want to catch a
[3178.00 - 3181.44] copy of that
[3178.96 - 3182.96] it's a critical book to have and the
[3181.44 - 3184.16] other one too cleanse the heel is a
[3182.96 - 3185.76] critical book to have
[3184.16 - 3186.96] as well so if you guys don't have it you
[3185.76 - 3187.92] might want to get those you get it free
[3186.96 - 3189.44] at the library if you don't want to go
[3187.92 - 3193.52] to amazon for the discount
[3189.44 - 3196.00] the amazon they control the pricing
[3193.52 - 3197.60] when you start cleaning up that liver
[3196.00 - 3198.56] and killing off those viruses and you
[3197.60 - 3200.32] learn how to do it
[3198.56 - 3202.16] some people celery juice isn't going to
[3200.32 - 3203.92] be enough but you have to have a celery
[3202.16 - 3206.24] juice it's a critical part of it like
[3203.92 - 3207.76] the celery juice is like a critical
[3206.24 - 3209.36] piece of getting rid of that excellent
[3207.76 - 3210.96] psoriasis
[3209.36 - 3212.56] but if you have a real stubborn epstein
[3210.96 - 3214.24] bar and you're not doing other things
[3212.56 - 3215.52] then now you got to bring in other tools
[3214.24 - 3216.40] in the protocols and medical medium
[3215.52 - 3218.56] healing tools
[3216.40 - 3219.44] got to bring in the zinc the right kind
[3218.56 - 3221.36] of liquid
[3219.44 - 3223.20] sulfate zinc you got to bring the right
[3221.36 - 3224.88] kind of supplements in too
[3223.20 - 3227.04] but i've seen people they clean up their
[3224.88 - 3229.04] diet enough they get rid of their vices
[3227.04 - 3230.56] they're getting off the caffeine they're
[3229.04 - 3232.64] getting off of the milk
[3230.56 - 3234.88] cheese butter they're using their celery
[3232.64 - 3235.60] juice they're annihilating their epstein
[3234.88 - 3237.52] bar
[3235.60 - 3239.36] or if somebody's got acne they're
[3237.52 - 3242.24] annihilating their strep
[3239.36 - 3244.24] inside the liver and they're cleaning
[3242.24 - 3246.80] things up so they get rid of all that
[3244.24 - 3248.72] acne on their skin
[3246.80 - 3251.12] so you can do it the tools are there but
[3248.72 - 3254.56] celery juice is a big part of it
[3251.12 - 3256.24] so is this so when someone has a juicer
[3254.56 - 3257.28] is it a medical tool it's a medical
[3256.24 - 3260.40] device
[3257.28 - 3262.16] it is and it's an herbal extractor and
[3260.40 - 3265.20] it's helping you get rid
[3262.16 - 3266.72] of conditions that's what it's doing
[3265.20 - 3268.24] celery juice is helping reverse
[3266.72 - 3270.48] conditions elizabeth says
[3268.24 - 3272.64] elizabeth ann smith is there a reason
[3270.48 - 3273.92] you choose that juicer over the other
[3272.64 - 3276.40] omega
[3273.92 - 3278.64] yeah wide mouth absolutely that's not
[3276.40 - 3280.48] the celery juicer so the other one is
[3278.64 - 3283.04] not the celery juicer
[3280.48 - 3284.72] um and so the whole point about this
[3283.04 - 3286.08] juicer it's the celery juicer and it
[3284.72 - 3287.68] juices other
[3286.08 - 3289.04] stuff too it juices i love it for
[3287.68 - 3289.68] anything i'll juice anything in fact
[3289.04 - 3292.80] i'll do
[3289.68 - 3294.56] a juice someday with other stuff the
[3292.80 - 3296.88] reason why i choose this juicer
[3294.56 - 3298.16] one reason is because what you just
[3296.88 - 3300.32] witnessed you won't get
[3298.16 - 3302.72] from any other omega juicer you won't
[3300.32 - 3305.76] get a little ball
[3302.72 - 3308.80] of dried pulp
[3305.76 - 3310.72] dried fiber that's it right there
[3308.80 - 3312.48] you won't get that that that's not in
[3310.72 - 3314.08] the other juicers so if you go to
[3312.48 - 3315.84] omega juicers.com and you see there's
[3314.08 - 3317.76] another juicer for sale
[3315.84 - 3319.60] you're not going to be able to extract
[3317.76 - 3321.84] that celery juice
[3319.60 - 3323.84] like this there's no way so this is
[3321.84 - 3325.12] their celery juicer models the mm-900
[3323.84 - 3327.36] hds
[3325.12 - 3329.84] what this means is you just cut your
[3327.36 - 3332.88] celery in half your celery costs in half
[3329.84 - 3334.24] at least by a third at least by a third
[3332.88 - 3335.44] i've seen it where it's a half so it's
[3334.24 - 3336.96] half the cost
[3335.44 - 3338.56] the juicer paid for itself paid for
[3336.96 - 3339.68] itself paid for itself over and over
[3338.56 - 3341.12] again
[3339.68 - 3342.72] i mean wouldn't you tell it wouldn't you
[3341.12 - 3344.40] tell your friends that if
[3342.72 - 3346.00] something paid for itself over and over
[3344.40 - 3347.04] again i mean this is it right here
[3346.00 - 3351.12] here's the pulp
[3347.04 - 3354.56] that's it just lost it that's it
[3351.12 - 3354.56] all it is is that much
[3355.12 - 3358.32] why do i like to throw things in the air
[3357.04 - 3359.60] lorraine you're gonna have to
[3358.32 - 3361.36] lorraine l you're gonna have to figure
[3359.60 - 3362.96] that one out for me how can i throw
[3361.36 - 3367.12] stuff in the air all the time
[3362.96 - 3369.04] i wonder what that is maybe
[3367.12 - 3371.28] lorraine one thing i noticed about your
[3369.04 - 3374.00] comments is they're really thoughtful
[3371.28 - 3376.56] and they really you really understand
[3374.00 - 3378.72] medical medium information of like
[3376.56 - 3380.08] is as are the people off caffeine are
[3378.72 - 3382.32] they off
[3380.08 - 3383.76] are they off their exactly their vices
[3382.32 - 3385.20] or what other what other stuff or they
[3383.76 - 3386.24] have junk and other stuff
[3385.20 - 3387.60] because every now and then you'll see
[3386.24 - 3389.36] somebody say oh medical medium
[3387.60 - 3392.16] information that's not new
[3389.36 - 3394.16] that's not original there's been that
[3392.16 - 3397.20] information was out there really
[3394.16 - 3398.48] because you know lorraine when i read
[3397.20 - 3400.56] your comments
[3398.48 - 3402.40] you you've been around the health
[3400.56 - 3404.16] movement for a long time
[3402.40 - 3405.76] you haven't seen all the different
[3404.16 - 3406.56] protocols like this the way they're put
[3405.76 - 3408.32] together
[3406.56 - 3409.92] systematically by spirit of compassion
[3408.32 - 3412.16] that doesn't exist out there
[3409.92 - 3414.80] it's here and celery juice is one of
[3412.16 - 3417.28] those tools
[3414.80 - 3418.40] yeah tick tick tock says juggling the
[3417.28 - 3421.36] handle tick tock
[3418.40 - 3423.20] not the app uh lorraine says emote this
[3421.36 - 3426.24] is motivational
[3423.20 - 3428.24] it's hard to break vices when
[3426.24 - 3430.24] we're around family and friends we're
[3428.24 - 3431.92] the bad people
[3430.24 - 3434.00] we're the people that you know we're
[3431.92 - 3436.24] just causing an up eve we're making
[3434.00 - 3438.48] everybody feel uncomfortable
[3436.24 - 3440.24] is what we're doing i think what a big
[3438.48 - 3442.24] part of the whole vice breaking thing
[3440.24 - 3444.08] around loved ones and others and friends
[3442.24 - 3446.00] and co-workers is that
[3444.08 - 3447.92] yeah it's making it it's making them
[3446.00 - 3451.04] feel uncomfortable because they're not
[3447.92 - 3454.00] eating healthy or healthy enough
[3451.04 - 3454.56] and they're stuck on vices they're stuck
[3454.00 - 3457.68] on the
[3454.56 - 3460.00] you know the bad sugar the bad fat
[3457.68 - 3461.84] all the time they're stuck on the milk
[3460.00 - 3463.20] cheese the butter which is the bad fat
[3461.84 - 3464.24] and the bad sugar because that's all
[3463.20 - 3466.40] lactose
[3464.24 - 3467.68] the bad sugar they're stuck on the
[3466.40 - 3469.76] different things there's you know
[3467.68 - 3471.60] and they don't want to be feeling
[3469.76 - 3472.64] uncomfortable because you're changing
[3471.60 - 3475.28] your life
[3472.64 - 3476.64] you're working on healing you're working
[3475.28 - 3478.72] hard to heal
[3476.64 - 3479.92] they don't want to feel that they don't
[3478.72 - 3481.92] want to feel that
[3479.92 - 3485.04] shannon says oh my god yes my family
[3481.92 - 3486.72] thinks i'm crazy for eating healthy
[3485.04 - 3488.72] so you're you need to be eating some
[3486.72 - 3489.20] pizza shannon i think that's what it is
[3488.72 - 3490.88] right
[3489.20 - 3492.56] you need to eat a donut in front of them
[3490.88 - 3493.04] is that what you have to do is you have
[3492.56 - 3495.28] to
[3493.04 - 3497.36] you have to throw yourself on the line
[3495.28 - 3499.28] for them is that what you have to do
[3497.36 - 3500.48] you have to eat a pizza in front of them
[3499.28 - 3502.16] right you gotta
[3500.48 - 3503.84] you gotta prove yourself do you have to
[3502.16 - 3505.36] prove yourself you have to prove
[3503.84 - 3505.68] yourself because that's what we feel
[3505.36 - 3508.32] like
[3505.68 - 3509.76] we're told to feel that way we're pushed
[3508.32 - 3510.24] into feeling that way that now we have
[3509.76 - 3512.08] to
[3510.24 - 3514.32] we have to do it for them like let's
[3512.08 - 3515.76] take a hit for them
[3514.32 - 3517.28] even though it's not going to make you
[3515.76 - 3518.24] healthy which isn't going to be good for
[3517.28 - 3520.32] friends and family
[3518.24 - 3523.28] if you're not healthy but i better take
[3520.32 - 3523.28] this hit for them
[3523.84 - 3527.68] and it's it's unfair really when you
[3526.08 - 3530.48] think about it
[3527.68 - 3533.52] so so you'll end up being in put to a
[3530.48 - 3536.24] place where you're being pushed into
[3533.52 - 3537.84] having to eat the foods that aren't good
[3536.24 - 3539.60] for you that you know and your heart and
[3537.84 - 3541.84] soul aren't good for you
[3539.60 - 3543.20] but they always have the upper hand tic
[3541.84 - 3546.32] toc says no more
[3543.20 - 3548.32] they always have the upper hand and the
[3546.32 - 3550.72] upper hand is
[3548.32 - 3552.72] it's hard to break these foods it's hard
[3550.72 - 3555.44] we've been raised on them we have
[3552.72 - 3556.96] these are comfort foods we've had these
[3555.44 - 3560.24] comfort foods in our system
[3556.96 - 3560.96] for in a long many many years we've
[3560.24 - 3562.40] lived with them
[3560.96 - 3564.56] we know what these comfort foods feel
[3562.40 - 3566.48] like inside of us they store
[3564.56 - 3568.48] away inside our organs deep in our
[3566.48 - 3570.40] organs they store away
[3568.48 - 3572.24] and people don't realize that aspect of
[3570.40 - 3576.56] it too when you eat
[3572.24 - 3579.36] all the comfort foods the comfort foods
[3576.56 - 3580.24] are stored deep in organ tissue they
[3579.36 - 3583.44] become
[3580.24 - 3585.04] part of the tissue something to know
[3583.44 - 3586.80] that's really important
[3585.04 - 3588.40] so when you're eating all the milk
[3586.80 - 3590.08] cheese butter
[3588.40 - 3592.40] when you're eating when you have all the
[3590.08 - 3594.96] msg when you're doing all the
[3592.40 - 3596.72] msg deposits in the brain it deposits
[3594.96 - 3598.64] inside the liver
[3596.72 - 3600.24] these things become part of our cells
[3598.64 - 3601.52] and then we walk around with all this
[3600.24 - 3603.92] baggage
[3601.52 - 3605.52] of the past inside of us we walk around
[3603.92 - 3607.76] with all this baggage
[3605.52 - 3609.76] all the baggage of the past is inside of
[3607.76 - 3611.84] us
[3609.76 - 3613.60] something to consider right there so
[3611.84 - 3617.68] anyway talk about the
[3613.60 - 3620.88] hcs breaking the eczema
[3617.68 - 3624.08] breaking it breaking psoriasis
[3620.88 - 3627.28] breaking conditions breaking
[3624.08 - 3628.72] health issues sun spots if someone's
[3627.28 - 3631.12] worried about sun spots
[3628.72 - 3633.04] so i've seen celery juice reverse
[3631.12 - 3634.88] wrinkles in people
[3633.04 - 3636.24] give them make them look 10 years
[3634.88 - 3639.84] younger 15 years
[3636.24 - 3641.60] younger reversing you know skin issues
[3639.84 - 3643.12] of all kinds and that's just some that's
[3641.60 - 3644.48] just one part not even talking about the
[3643.12 - 3646.48] lupus and the lyme disease the
[3644.48 - 3648.08] neurological lyme and
[3646.48 - 3650.16] in all the other different conditions
[3648.08 - 3652.08] autoimmune in general you guys
[3650.16 - 3654.08] a lot of people don't even get a
[3652.08 - 3656.88] diagnosis anymore
[3654.08 - 3657.76] they get just an autoimmune label go to
[3656.88 - 3660.40] your doctor they're
[3657.76 - 3661.44] running the a a they can't really put a
[3660.40 - 3663.44] label on your
[3661.44 - 3665.28] illness but they'll put they'll give you
[3663.44 - 3667.20] the autoimmune label but they won't give
[3665.28 - 3669.04] you an individual
[3667.20 - 3670.56] an individual diagnosis anymore i've
[3669.04 - 3672.16] seen that out there now
[3670.56 - 3673.36] so a lot of doctors are sending people
[3672.16 - 3674.48] out the door they're not saying they
[3673.36 - 3676.16] have lupus
[3674.48 - 3677.76] they're not saying they got neurological
[3676.16 - 3678.32] lyme they're sending them out the door
[3677.76 - 3680.96] with just
[3678.32 - 3683.04] autoimmune when it's when it's mild in a
[3680.96 - 3686.24] lot of people
[3683.04 - 3689.04] near xenia says i'm 20 years younger so
[3686.24 - 3690.00] lorraine says i love mm info anthony and
[3689.04 - 3692.00] the juggling
[3690.00 - 3693.36] doing a lot of juggling today trying to
[3692.00 - 3694.88] get my words right
[3693.36 - 3697.04] good thing spirit of compassion is here
[3694.88 - 3699.92] to help so let's give you guys the quick
[3697.04 - 3701.36] takeaways real quick okay
[3699.92 - 3703.20] you're gonna feel pressure from the
[3701.36 - 3704.48] people around you when it comes down to
[3703.20 - 3706.24] the vices
[3704.48 - 3707.92] breaking vices is hard because that's
[3706.24 - 3709.44] one of the big reasons why it's hard
[3707.92 - 3710.96] if you don't have any of that pressure
[3709.44 - 3712.40] around you it's hard enough
[3710.96 - 3713.52] it's hard enough even if you don't have
[3712.40 - 3715.12] all the family and the friends and the
[3713.52 - 3717.04] co-workers and anybody else
[3715.12 - 3719.20] that's around you pushing you into
[3717.04 - 3720.64] eating that acidic acidic acidic diet
[3719.20 - 3724.24] the other takeaway is
[3720.64 - 3727.76] acid the fats are the acid too
[3724.24 - 3730.40] fatty acids all that fat in the
[3727.76 - 3732.32] bloodstream makes you terribly acidic
[3730.40 - 3733.76] if you're plant-based you're eating your
[3732.32 - 3735.84] avocados every day
[3733.76 - 3737.12] and you want to become alkaline you're
[3735.84 - 3738.72] losing your chance
[3737.12 - 3740.24] so you got to slow down you got to have
[3738.72 - 3741.84] a little avocado here
[3740.24 - 3744.08] you gotta have just you know little nut
[3741.84 - 3745.92] butter here gotta have a little bit of
[3744.08 - 3748.40] olive oil here but you gotta be careful
[3745.92 - 3750.00] another thing is the big acid ones
[3748.40 - 3751.92] apple cider vinegar the coffee the
[3750.00 - 3753.60] caffeine don't get tricked by the
[3751.92 - 3755.28] mushroom coffee
[3753.60 - 3757.20] basically it's they're drug dealers
[3755.28 - 3758.48] right now out there it's it's it's
[3757.20 - 3760.16] unbelievable what's happening and
[3758.48 - 3761.12] they're turning good people into drug
[3760.16 - 3763.12] dealers
[3761.12 - 3764.80] because there's the mlm marketing scheme
[3763.12 - 3767.84] with the mushroom coffee
[3764.80 - 3769.44] and if you stick coffee with anything
[3767.84 - 3771.68] just people are going to be like whoa i
[3769.44 - 3773.60] feel good i feel good
[3771.68 - 3775.68] because they're out they're high on
[3773.60 - 3778.16] caffeine it's the greatest trick
[3775.68 - 3779.68] it's the greatest trick so be careful on
[3778.16 - 3781.28] that right there it's another one that's
[3779.68 - 3783.36] going on around there
[3781.28 - 3784.80] remember you know that this is an herbal
[3783.36 - 3786.72] extractor
[3784.80 - 3788.00] keep that in mind sales running for a
[3786.72 - 3789.36] couple of days more
[3788.00 - 3790.80] and then the sale is going to be gone i
[3789.36 - 3793.68] don't know the next time this this model
[3790.80 - 3797.28] is going to be on sale like that
[3793.68 - 3799.04] and keep in mind too that it's all about
[3797.28 - 3800.96] what what are you doing to take care of
[3799.04 - 3802.72] yourself start with the mm tools

[3805.60 - 3810.00] you need to start that way baby steps
[3807.52 - 3811.52] get out the dairy get out the eggs get
[3810.00 - 3813.28] some things out of there
[3811.52 - 3815.20] if you've got a baby step if you need to
[3813.28 - 3816.24] go deeper you go deeper into the
[3815.20 - 3818.24] protocols
[3816.24 - 3820.00] and you learn how to do your 32 ounces
[3818.24 - 3821.44] of celery juice
[3820.00 - 3823.60] and you learn how to do the right
[3821.44 - 3824.08] supplementation and dosages like in the
[3823.60 - 3826.64] books
[3824.08 - 3828.40] critical medical books right here if you
[3826.64 - 3830.32] hear somebody that says i did mm and it

[3830.32 - 3836.56] keep in mind the fly on the wall
[3834.00 - 3837.04] keep in mind on the fly on the wall
[3836.56 - 3839.12] because
[3837.04 - 3840.96] what are they doing what supplements had
[3839.12 - 3842.32] alcohol what had natural flavors what
[3840.96 - 3844.88] had msg
[3842.32 - 3845.44] what did they even do the right dosages
[3844.88 - 3846.96] what
[3845.44 - 3849.12] foods are they still bringing in where's
[3846.96 - 3849.60] the nutritional yeast which is the bad
[3849.12 - 3851.12] stuff
[3849.60 - 3852.48] how much vinegar are they doing how much
[3851.12 - 3853.68] chocolate can they break the chocolate
[3852.48 - 3854.96] they're doing chocolate every couple
[3853.68 - 3856.72] weeks and you need to heal and you're
[3854.96 - 3858.88] seriously sick it's not going to happen

[3860.56 - 3865.28] and everything
[3862.96 - 3866.56] so lunell correct i don't recommend
[3865.28 - 3868.48] coffee enemas it's one of the worst
[3866.56 - 3870.40] things you can do
[3868.48 - 3872.40] damage is the central nervous system
[3870.40 - 3875.12] actually damages it because the stomach
[3872.40 - 3877.44] buffers the caffeine and you can't
[3875.12 - 3879.28] buffer it when it goes up the back end
[3877.44 - 3880.96] so it goes straight to the nerves and it
[3879.28 - 3883.20] injures the nerves
[3880.96 - 3884.80] because so keep that in mind it also
[3883.20 - 3885.76] injures the adrenals when you do coffee
[3884.80 - 3888.80] enemas
