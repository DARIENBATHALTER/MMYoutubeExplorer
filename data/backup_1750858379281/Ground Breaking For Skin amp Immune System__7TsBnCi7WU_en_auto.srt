you guys I'm gonna make a bunch of

121
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,340
different things I'm just letting you

122
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,759
know how incredible this is

123
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,580
this is the micro C pack Julie says how

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,100
is this different than micro C capsules

125
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,259
it's enhanced the micro C capsules are

126
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,940
amazing but here's the difference you

127
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,979
don't have to open the capsules anymore

128
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,100
so many people who open the capsules

129
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,199
because you're doing the vitamin C shock

130
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,639
therapy you're doing the medical medium

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,800
vitamin C shot therapy and you're

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,360
opening up the capsules right and so

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,860
many of you are opening up the capsules

134
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,139
for the kids

135
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,520
that's how this is different all on its

136
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,020
own and then that's not the only reason

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,520
why this is different but that's how

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,620
it's different everybody's opening up

139
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,300
the capsules you see I think half the

140
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,340
people out there easily open up the

141
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,960
capsules because they're mixing it and

142
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,580
things they're making the vitamin C

143
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,800
shock therapy they're they're opening up

144
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,840
the capsules for the kids all of that

145
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,060
well you don't have to open up the

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,320
capsules anymore the other thing is

147
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,020
organic

148
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,199
bamboo silica

149
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,860
when you have organic bamboo silica in

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,740
the mix of this already potent collagen

151
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,800
also building properties that are in

152
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,860
here with the immune enhancing because

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,440
immune system in the skin

154
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,720
immune system is in the skin

155
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,699
and so when you feed your immune system

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,460
and it's in the skin and then you've got

157
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,560
the organic bamboo silica it's the other

158
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,139
different

159
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,699

458
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,100
like I said when I see out there vitamin

459
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,039
C's

460
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,480
I shrill I shrug and there's a reason I

461
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,460
think about the stomach aches the kids

462
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,260
are gonna have I think about the belly

463
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,960
aches the adults are gonna have I think

464
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,840
about the acid poops people are gonna

465
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,720
have the acid poops

466
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,700
the acid runs the squirts

467
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,740
because you can't take enough of the

468
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,840
other vitamin C's out there without

469
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,460
crapping your pants you can't take

470
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,740
enough of the other vitamin C's out

471
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,900
there without having the runs or

472
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,580
diarrhea you can't take enough of the

473
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,260
vitamin C's out there without burning

474
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,080
your stomach and that's the difference

475
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,640
right there so I know if you're here out

476
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,620
there oh vitamin C is good for you

477
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,620

478
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,500
what people don't realize it just burns

479
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,299
it burns it burns an ascorbic sharp that

480
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
acid and then if you take too much of

481
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,539
those vitamin C's out there you know

482
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,000

486
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,840
of these things they get in the way and

487
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
it matters when you're somebody that's

488
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,020

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,179
instantly when I'm taking that sip I

556
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,220
want to tell you guys I want you guys

557
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,340
you can do this with me too if you'd

558
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,340
like

559
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,400
what's happening is it's entering my

560
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,580
body the first thing I'm saying is

561
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,580
immune cells are you there

562
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,700
okay lymphocytes are you there

563
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,000
white blood count are you there

564
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,460
and I'm connecting with it my immune

565
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
system because what's entering my body

566
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:19,020
is revolutionary it is groundbreaking

567
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,960
this is an incredible vitamin C and

568
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,080
vitamin C

569
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,640
halts that oxidative stress so all the

570
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,799
stress and oxidation that's happening

571
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,600
inside my body from all the stress I'm

572
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
under all the different stuff that we

573
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,120
have to deal with the environmental

574
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,620
pollutions coming out of the sky

575
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,559
everything else

576
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,500
right now I'm just seeing this vitamin C

577
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,360
run through my body and start to break

578
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,039
actually start to break that cycle of

579
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,520
oxidative stress the next thing it is I

580
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:50,159
want my immune system to receive

581
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,840
and see it and recognize it and start to

582
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,980
eat it and Gobble it up so this is

583
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,539
important I'm going to have a little bit

584
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,820
more

585
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,799
in the micro C shock therapy

586
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,740
if you guys just came on here

587
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,120
we're talking about this right now

588
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,220
all right

589
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,380
so what I'm envisioning is my white

590
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,260
blood cells

591
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,240
they want to destroy microbes that are

592
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,240
not supposed to be in me that's what our

593
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,120
white blood cells love to do they seek

594
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:22,200
them out they look for them

595
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:25,200
but if they're under fed under fueled

596
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,460
they don't work as good

597
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,980
if the white blood cell is under fed

598
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,520
malnourished not fueled to its capacity

599
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,500
it doesn't do the job it needs to do so

600
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,720
this is important to know

601
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,039
so I'm envisioning that white blood cell

602
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,400
right there

603
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,940
all of a sudden running into

604
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,100
that vitamin C that's going coursing

605
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,380
through my bloodstream right now

606
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,620
and what it does is our immune system

607
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,760
loves to gobble up vitamin C it loves to

608
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,000
use it

609
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:04,260
getting fueled is critical so I like to

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,919
Envision my immune cells taking in that

611
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,919
vitamin C

612
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,780
so good so delicious

613
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,020
and as it's taking in that vitamin C

614
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,919
it's strengthening and I see and

615
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:22,500
envision my immune system strengthening

616
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
coming empowered

617
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,760
getting strong

618
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,539
because you want your immune cells

619
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:34,380
strong you want this immune powder

620
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:38,039
to get infused into your immune cells

621
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,440
this is a critical exercise right here

622
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,780
an important one

623
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,120
it has its gobbling up and gobbling up

624
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,480
and absorbing

625
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,280
that immune powder that's mainlined in

626
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,740
your system

627
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,620
okay it's getting stronger and you

628
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,600
envision that you see it

629
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,820
okay and then you give your immune

630
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,340
system Direction

631
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,380
I want you to go after things that are

632
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,419
not supposed to be in me I want you to

633
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,919
go after the microbes that are not

634
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,600
supposed to be in me I want you to go

635
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,620
after those little buggies that aren't

636
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,620
supposed to be in me

637
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,820
and you get your immune system to work

638
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,460
with you and work for you and that is

639
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,780
powerful all on its own

640
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,780
and that's what I like to do

641
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,740
so this is the

642
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,539
vitamin C shock therapy I'm enjoying it

643
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,380

655
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,059

this right

657
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,659
and in this blender I'm going to make a

658
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,000
green smoothie

659
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,980
I got some mango I'm gonna use that for

660
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,440
the green smoothie

661
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,659
I have some spinach I'm going to use

662
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,100
that for the green smoothie and I have

663
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,480
some celery sticks I'm going to use that

664
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,419
for the green smoothie

665
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,679
but I'm gonna change things around a

666
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,720
little bit

667
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm gonna add

668
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,279
the micro C powder immune powder in this

669
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,620
green smoothie

670
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,299
that's what I'm gonna do

671
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,179
I was really excited about this because

672
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,860
I wanted to do this so bad now the green

673
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,419
smoothie recipe I'm using right here is

674
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,460
in cleanse the heel I don't know if you

675
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:50,220
guys have this I want to show you

676
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,980
that's the green smoothie recipe it's

677
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,779
three medium sized bananas I prefer

678
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,919
mango in this one right now I'm excited

679
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,620
about that

680
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,360
or three cups of diced mango so let's

681
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,539
get the three cups of diced mango in

682
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,539
here

683
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,299
so great

684
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,100
I love mango

685
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,500
so I prefer some mango in this green

686
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,240
smoothie right here

687
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,900
we're gonna do three cups we're gonna

688
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,360
get a decent amount of mango in here

689
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,580
now if you you know what happens is that

690
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,919
so many people break open the capsules

691
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,840
they open the capsules because they want

692
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,720
to take a lot of this incredible vitamin

693
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,840
C this micro C because it's buffered

694
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,179
it's easier it's easy on the body

695
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,659
easy on the stomach easy on the stomach

696
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:42,360
lining easy on the intestinal tract how

697
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,740
incredible was that all in its own all

698
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,940
right

699
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,919
so

700
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,140
the green smoothie recipe is not only

701
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,480
that it's now one to two stalks of

702
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,220
celery chopped

703
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,260
so I'm gonna chop a couple of stalks of

704
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,059
celery I'm gonna get that into this

705
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,059
green smoothie just bear with me

706
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,799
so many things you hear out there

707
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,039
one to two stalks of celery

708
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,039
foreign

709
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:21,179
okay next thing is four cups of tightly

710
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,539
packed spinach so I'm gonna get a

711
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:29,480
measuring cup possibly here we are

712
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:29,480
four cups of tightly packed spinach now

713
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,860
what I like doing here

714
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,440
is putting that buffered

715
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,600
immune powder

716
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,200
in a green smoothie

717
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,200
yeah

718
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,900
there we go I want a tight tightly pack

719
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,900
this in right here

720
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,020
you know you hear out there all the time

721
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,720
vitamin C vitamin C and it's like

722
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,400
meanwhile it's like

723
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,760
yeah

724
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,059
vitamin C all right what kind

725
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,120
is it two kinds of buffered PhD out what

726
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:08,340
kind is it just ascorbic strain acid

727
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,200
burns a hole in your stomach or is it

728
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,799
the kind with the fatty lipids attached

729
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,980
to the ascorbic acid which has got awful

730
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:18,840
because it the that inhibits the vitamin

731
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,419
C you know getting to where it needs to

732
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,279
get okay so that's four cups tightly

733
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,360
packed spinach

734
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,360
let's get this in here

00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:32,100
one cup of water

736
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,720
if you really want you can put some some

737
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,020
orange juice in there too if you really

738
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,020
want

739
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,980
all right spinach is going in

740
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,919

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,510
I've been waiting so long for a really

763
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,960
powerful collagen building property

764
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:15,200
[Music]

765
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,200
here we go

766
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,740
nice

767
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,659
you take all nuts

768
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:44,820
when you take all that spinach

769
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,159
and you bring that spinach

770
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,600
with that vitamin C together so all

771
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,600
those trace minerals from the spinach

772
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,059
and you actually

773
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,380
take that vitamin C and you mix it in

774
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,380

775
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,880

777
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,120
powder right there

778
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,559
incredible there it is

779
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,020
I don't know if you guys can see that

780
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,940
but it's so perfect

781
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,039
that is the green smoothie with the

782
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,020
micro seed powder

783
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,659
so not only are you actually getting the

784
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,580
micro C powder collagen building effects

785
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,200
right there you're bringing it into the

786
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,600
green smoothie

787
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,700
how good is that and what you won't see

788
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,380
in this green smoothie is a whole bunch

789
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,500
of fat you don't see a whole bunch of

790
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,659
oil put into here or coconut oil because

791
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,820
that inhibits what you're trying to do

792
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:49,200
you especially if you're dealing with

793
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,360
something or trying to battle something

794
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,039
or you got a cold or you got something

795
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,020
you're under the weather

796
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,000
you want something as clean as this

797
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,980
green smoothie without all the junk in

798
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,080
it without all the garbage in it that

799
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,659
all is natural flavors and I want to get

800
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,760
to another point with that

801
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,520
what you won't see in here are the

802
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,799
anti-caking agents so understand that

803
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,460
not only is this

804
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,799
literally the best the best there is on

805
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,320
the market but what you won't see in

806
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,240
here and once you won't have to

807
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,659
experience and eat

808
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,059
is the anti-caking agents

809
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,399
they don't put that in here

810
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:33,059
that is groundbreaking all on its own

811
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:35,279
that's revolutionary people don't know

812
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,679
how good that really is and what that

813
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,899
means because what happens is all these

814
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,880
anti-kicking agents are in everybody's

815
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:44,880
powders and they don't know it because

816
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,679
you don't have to disclose it

817
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,299
there's a rule you don't have to

818
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,519
disclose a certain percentage of

819
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,860
ingredients in the supplements out there

820
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,080
in the world and companies will say how

821
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,659
good and quality and how great the great

822
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,899
it is but they'll never say

823
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:03,779
there's no anti-caking agent in our

824
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:06,179
product because they can't

825
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,300
vimergy can say that there's no

826
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:12,480
anti-kicking agents in this immune

827
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,580
powder in this collagen promoting immune

828
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,220
powder

829
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,619
that alone is mind-blowing not to

830
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:23,280
mention no alcohol not to mention no

831
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:27,419
natural flavors which is MSG

832
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,359
no vinegars no caffeine

833
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,919
it's a whole nother thing all on its own

834
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,020
that's

835
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,879
mind-blowing we got the green smoothie

836
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,220
made let's make some other things too

837
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,320

852
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,599
I'm gonna scoop it in the bowl

853
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,740
there we go

854
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,740

we're gonna mash the avocado up

858
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,880
I mean you could eat your avocado in

859
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,240
pieces if you want you can also mash it

860
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,119
I prefer to mash it I like it slightly

861
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,040
with like hunkier pieces I don't like it

862
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,040
where it's just like a cream cream

863
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,640
I don't like avocado puree but that's

864
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,740
just my opinion that's my taste that's

865
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,400

00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,640
this is a steamed potato I want I don't

931
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,980
want anybody confused thinking that this

932
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,119
is a raw potato that wouldn't be good

933
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,680
because I don't think you're going to be

934
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,820
able to really do this in fact you're

935
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,380
not going to be able to do this has to

936
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,480
be a steamed potato or a cooked potato

937
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,460
maybe you have a baked potato and that's

938
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,680
what you have

939
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,119
when you're doing that and that's fine

940
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:21,300
so we're mashing this potato up nicely

941
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,820
I feel so fueled

942
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,480
by that

943
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,640
vitamin C shock therapy with the micro C

944
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,480
it feels so good coursing through my

945
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,460
veins I love the feeling

946
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,820

947
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,820

949
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,500
get another clove of garlic real quick

950
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,680
there you go there's the potato right

951
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,680

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
I'm gonna move the potato over and I'm

953
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,540
gonna get the garlic

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,980

955
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,140

957
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,619
mashed garlic a little bit now I'm gonna

958
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,280
chop it up if you guys don't mind

959
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,280
there you go

960
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,240
all right

961
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
there you go

962
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,619

963
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,020

964
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:25,460
garlic cover

965
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,460
there we go there we go

966
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,060
okay we're good SS but he says not to

967
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,160
have avocados in this morning not to eat

968
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,180
too many I've said that depending on

969
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,760
what's happening with your health

970
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,520
overall but

971
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,560
this is this is a different situation

972
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,440
this is when you feel like you're coming

973
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,220
down with something this is cold and flu

974
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,260
garlic therapy for colds and flu

975
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,420
you don't even have to start it in the

976
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,880
morning who says it has to be morning

977
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,680
that's the next thing too you can do

978
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,359
this three times a day and start this in

979
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,460
the afternoon do it later in the

980
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,260
afternoon and at night and this is an

981
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,720
option you don't have to use avocado

982
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,339
either that's the other point too this

983
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,579
option right here is potato there's no

984
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:14,099
avocado in this option so you have this

985
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:16,740
to do you don't have to say wow my only

986
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,780
way to do this is just avocado how am I

987
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,940
going to do that that's actually

988
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,920
actually you have all these different

989
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,760
options that's the potato one right

990
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,859

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,560
version you don't want to avocado in the

998
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,540

999
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,820

1182
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,980

1185
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,700
make all those things that I talk about

1186
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,160
happen with the vitamin C packets out

1187
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,680

1188
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,140

Squirts and your stomach's burning you

1191
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,500
can't give your kids too much they get

1192
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,260
the belly aches they get the acid

1193
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,780
stomach they don't feel good but yet we

1194
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,700
need the amount of vitamin C that we

1195
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,560
want to take without having that kind of

1196
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,280
stuff happen

1197
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,740

1198
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,599

micro C powder

1214
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:39,839
during mono I would I would if it was me

1215
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,940
if I had Mono I would but ask your

1216
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,740
doctor what's right for you

1217
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,480
ask your doctor what's right for you of

1218
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,740
course you know

1219
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:53,220
yep and um but yeah but I would if I was

1220
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:56,460
sick I would if I had Mono yeah I would

1221
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:59,040
if I had a cold I would

1222
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,380
I'm gonna do it anyway I don't have mono

1223
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,819
I don't have a cold I'm gonna do it

1224
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,940
anyway

1225
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:09,480
geisie says can you do that with roasted

1226
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,220
garlic you can you can the raw garlic

1227
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,280
stronger

1228
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,839
raw garlic is stronger but if for some

1229
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,220
reason it's too strong for you it's

1230
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,619
really intense and do a little bit of

1231
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,720
raw garlic do a little piece of the

1232
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:25,380
clove if you want let me get a little

1233
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,420
clip like one here and I'll show you

1234
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,599
I wanted to show you real quick

1235
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:33,480
so I'm taking a small piece of a clove

1236
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,800
right there if you can see all right I

1237
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,059
opened it up right there can you see

1238
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,500
that you guys

1239
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,660
see that right there

1240
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,880
okay if that's all you can do because

1241
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:45,660
it's raw garlic and raw garlic is so

1242
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,940
pungent it's so strong it's it can bite

1243
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,339
it's very bitey sometimes if that's all

1244
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,619
you got to do then use a little bit in

1245
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:54,900
that garlic therapy for cold slews and

1246
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,640
so forth that I just showed you but if

1247
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,260
you can't do that because raw Garlic's a

1248
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,359
little too hard on you do the roasted

1249
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,280
garlic do it the same way I showed you

1250
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:04,800
apply it the same way

1251
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,240
with roasted garlic I would probably

1252
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,819
recommend doing a little bit more than

1253
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,260
one clove if it's roasted garlic this

1254
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:12,720
way you get a little bit more of the

1255
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,700
garlic because it was roasted it's going

1256
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,380
to lose some of its properties and some

1257
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,540
of its value so you want you can

1258
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,400
actually do more than one and that's

1259
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,800
fine

1260
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,380
show you guys I'm just saying check out

1261
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,839

1264
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,280
profile in the description

1265
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,020
you'll see you see the big size you see

1266
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,339
the trial size you get the free lemon

1267
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:42,599
balm with it

1268
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:45,599
but honestly no anti-caking agents no

1269
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,760
MSG no natural flavor crap no alcohol no

1270
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,559
caffeine none of the junk never mind you

1271
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,240
know when you see products go no soy no

1272
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,280
whatever it's like yeah but you got you

1273
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,260
got anti-caking agents in there buddy

1274
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,240
and you got natural flavors in there

1275
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,460
buddy and you've got citric acid in

1276
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,280
there buddy which is really bad and you

1277
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,440
got you got forms of alcohol that you're

1278
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,579
not even disclosing you got all that in

1279
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,900
there but you ain't telling the

1280
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:08,780
customers or the consumers because

1281
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,000
you're allowed to do that

1282
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,740
vermergy isn't that

1283
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,260
and that's the difference and that's why

1284
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:18,720
I support them I could support

1285
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,300
any company I want

1286
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,260
companies knock on my door day in and

1287
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,839
day out

1288
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,260
over the years thousands of companies

1289
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:30,720
get aw on board but I won't support

1290
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,619
anybody I won't support any company

1291
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:38,280
unless they go so above board and so

1292
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:41,880
Advanced and so ahead of the Curve
