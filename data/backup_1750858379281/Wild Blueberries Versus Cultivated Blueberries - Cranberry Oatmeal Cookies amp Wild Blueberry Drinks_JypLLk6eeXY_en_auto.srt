1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,799
wild blueberry cultivated blueberry wild

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,240
blueberry are you eating all the

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,880
cultivated blueberries that's what you

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,960
do I'm getting some blueberry for my

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,240
smoothie I picked up some blueberries

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,160
and they're cultivated blueberry meaning

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,640
they're not as powerful they're not as

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,359
good for you they're not a lot of things

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,599
big difference between cultivated

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,960
blueberry and wild blueberry thousands

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,560
upon thousands of years of

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,320
adaptation literally thousands of years

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
Native Americans used to burn around

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,120
fields of wild blueberry because what

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,079
would happen is when they would burn it

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,399
all down the blueberries would come back

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,640
up everything else would be gone that's

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,840
a way they used to manage the wild

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,760
blueberry crops back th for thousands of

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,399
years anyway you guys we're live right

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,920
now and I'm making a whole bunch of

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,960
different drinks which is going to be

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,320
really fun I am also going to open up

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,640
aw's bar and grill in a little while too

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,399
that I'm going to do but I'm just going

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,079
to pour a couple drinks as I need more

27
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,600
drink myself I need a shot for myself

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,839
really quick so I want to tell you guys

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,799
okay that this talk about the wild

30
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,600
blueberry is really important because

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,400
don't you want the best of the best

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,479
inside your body and I understand if you

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,320
can't find a wild blueberry somewhere if

34
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,960
you have no access to it but if you have

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,640
access to it what an incredible support

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,840
system for our body especially when the

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,799
earth is getting crazy times are getting

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
crazy people are so stressed out people

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,360
are over the top stressed out and stress

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,960
we need adaptogenic we need things that

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,759
have anth sinins things that have powers

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,320
in them and that's what we need when

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
we're under

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
cultivated blueberries this is going to

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,880

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,799
drinks I'm serious spiced apple cider

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,280
wild blueberry we got all kinds of

99
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,959
things we're going to do this is going

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,079
to be a fun fun show so let's get into

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,680
it let's get into the nitty-gritty and

102
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,760
what we're talking about versus wild

103
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,720
blueberry difference between wild

104
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,280
blueberry and cultivated blueberry I

105
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,519
didn't want to get any cultivated

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,159
blueberries I just didn't want to I

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,840
didn't want to go and get those because

108
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,799
every time I see a cultivated

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,840
blueberry every time I see it in the

110
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,400
store or I see somebody using it I feel

111
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,400
bad there's just something that comes

112
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,479
over me because it's weak it's weak I

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,160
support it I like blueberries of all

114
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,199
kinds but it's not the same blueberry

115
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,759
it's not that adaptogenic power it's not

116
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,479
that high antiox oant rate it's not any

117
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,440
of that the anthocyans are different

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,520
it's not the same thing so I'll give you

119
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,960
little differences here a wild

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,199
food can survive on its own through

121
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,639
drought through floods through freezing

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,440
Tundra cold the cultivated blueberry was

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
a blueberry that wasn't just growing in

124
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,440
the wild so it's not like hey you know

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
these blueberries have been around for

126
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,600
thousands of years not true the

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,800
cultivated blueberry was a spinoff a

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,039
spin-off a cultivated spin-off from its

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,199
cousins the wild blueberry big

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,120
difference with the wild blueberry

131
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,360
versus the cultivated blueberry so I

132
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,919
want to give you one thing that's really

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,120
interesting

134
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:18,280
okay what happens if a disease hits a

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,720
crop if a disease hits a

136
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,520
crop the crop can get annihilated and

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,520
we're going to have disease hitting

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,600
crops in the future because of all the

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,840
gming all the heavy heavy GMO right all

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,479
of that just to begin with but crops are

141
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
not going to be able to be strong enough

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,639
they're not going to be able to sustain

143
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,600
a massive blow and that will be coming

144
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,440
in the future with crops so the

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,199
difference with what I'm saying is like

146
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,479
a cultivated crop like say the

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,720
cultivated a blueberry if a fungus comes

148
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,080
and eventually becomes strong enough and

149
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,800
hits a sensitivity in the crop and takes

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,360
out an entire cultivated blueberry crop

151
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,240
worldwide which it can it can do that

152
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,199
for virtually any crop by the way if it

153
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,280
does this the whole crop goes that's how

154
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,680
it works the difference with wild

155
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
blueberries is there are hundreds and

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,400
hundreds and hundreds of different

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,520
strains of wild blueberry plants in the

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,160
same crop in the same like if you look

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
at a wild Blueberry Field this is

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,840
important to know there are hundreds of

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,960
different

162
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,280
Geniuses oh I just saying say it that

163
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,680
way there are hundreds of different

164
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,800
varieties hundreds of different strains

165
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,479
they all look the same almost it's all

166
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,039
wild blueberries it's all sitting in the

167
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,199
field the difference

168
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,520
is that there are different plants even

169
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
though it's the same plant all within

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,960
that field that means that if disease

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,199
comes to the wild blueberry crop it may

172
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,560
only take out one or two species of

173
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,680
plant amongst the the entire field of

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,080
wild blueberries if a disease comes to a

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,280
cultivated crop it'll wipe the entire

176
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,400
cultivated crop out that's how it

177
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,919
works so what I love about wild

178
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,000
blueberries is because it's a

179
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,919
spiritual fruit very spiritual a lot of

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,599
reasons for that it's a survival

181
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,360
mechanism it also feeds animals and

182
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,000
keeps animals alive so here's another

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,840
thing too the cultivated blueberry and

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,280
done and gone it's not there for

185
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,720
wildlife it's not there for the survival

186
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,479
of wildlife too the wild blueberry is

187
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,360
powerful if it stays there and the cold

188
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,360
comes and it freezes on the vines they

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,879
sit there Frozen and just available for

190
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,360
the coyotes for the foxes for the Bears

191
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,240
for the deer for for mice for all forms

192
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,360
of wildlife so the the wild blueberry is

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,360
actually feeding all all these different

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,479
creatures and different animals

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,879
something a cultivated blueberry won't

196
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,520
do they pick the crop it's done that's

197
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,000
it wild blueberries are growing wild

198
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,400
they're all through the forests they're

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
all on the plains they're all in

200
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,440
different areas in this world and even

201
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,440
if you harvest them there's always wild

202
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,720
blueberries somewhere in those fields

203
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,840
left over or somewhere on adjacent or

204
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,879
somewhere on the outskirts of the fields

205
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,719
feeding all kinds of different Wildlife

206
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,599
Birds animals beer deer everything gets

207
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,880
the Bears it gets everything fed and

208
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,640
that's what's incredible about it all

209
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,839
along so when I think about it I think

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
about the W blueberry I always think

211
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,159
about what it's doing for nature what

212
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,920
it's doing for animal life what it's

213
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,480
doing for that and that means a lot so

214
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,640
what happens is when the winter sets in

215
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,080
it's getting cold the snow starts

216
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,320
falling these wild blueberries are

217
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
floating around in all kinds of

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
different places for all kinds of

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,240
different animals to survive on deer

220
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,480
push through the snow

221
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
right they push their snoots through the

222
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,279
snow and they actually get these wild

223
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,720
blueberries and they use them for

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,680
survival it means everything to keeping

225
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,360
deer alive through a whole winter

226
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
keeping any kind of animal alive through

227
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,680
a whole

228
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,360
winter so this is just one aspect of the

229
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,040
wild bluebery now what it's doing for

230
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,240
our bodies as far as like the

231
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,959
anthocyanins and how it's the anti

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,200
oxidizer is a whole another level of

233
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,040
power all on its own so we're oxidizing

234
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,760
that's what we're doing we actually

235
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,480
oxidize so when we age we're oxidizing

236
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,399
when we age that's how it works so every

237
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,200
free radicals and toxins that are

238
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,839
floating around our bodies oxidize us

239
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,519
aets that are actually flowing through

240
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,360
our body oxidizes us so everything's out

241
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,240
to get us toxins and poisons and

242
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,360
chemicals and toxic heavy metals that we

243
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,040
get exposed to are all there to oxidize

244
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,839
us right age us or age our organs or

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,560
kill our organs or break our organs down

246
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,880
so so that's what that's what it's like

247
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,320
here on planet Earth the chems coming

248
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,240
out of the sky the smoke and the fog all

249
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,560
the burning the excess burning that

250
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,959
happens all around the world right those

251
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,120
massive fires all the fire [ __ ] and

252
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,040
they're dropping off all all on you know

253
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,800
onto those fires all this stuff blowing

254
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,680
around the DDT that's floating around

255
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,880
the planet because DDT is still used all

256
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
around the world all the pesticides

257
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,040
herbicides the fungicides it's on the

258
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,320
the clothes that we're wearing brand new

259
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,480
clothing items are dous with flame

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,079
retardant DED with fungicides right so

261
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,200
we're exposed every single day fabric

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,079
softeners we're exposed to detergents

263
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,800
we're exposed to plugin air fresheners

264
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,200
we're exposed to fragrances perfumes

265
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,399
colognes you name it all of this stuff

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,560
is oxidizing us that's what it does and

267
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,240
it increases that oxidation level and

268
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,079
that oxidizing makes it so everybody's

269
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,079
running out and getting plastic surgery

270
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,639
that's how it works why are they getting

271
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,920
plastic surgery some people are getting

272
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,760
plastic surgery because they want their

273
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,440
nose in a different spot some people are

274
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,680
getting plastic surgery I'm not harping

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,600
on that I'm just saying they're getting

276
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,000
plastic surgery right because they want

277
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,959
some changes but most people are getting

278
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,920
plastic surgery because their skin is

279
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,320
starting to fail them because it's

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,320
oxidizing and that's part of the aging

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,000
process somebody can age faster well

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
they're oxidizing faster someone can age

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
takes a little longer it's taking a

284
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,880
little longer for them them to oxidize

285
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
one way or another it still doesn't even

286
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,000
mean they're not oxidizing internally

287
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,040
with different organs in different parts

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,639
parts of their

289
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,639
body but the world and the stress and

290
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,320
the pollutions and the pathogens and the

291
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,200
toxins created by

292
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,160
pathogens and the lawn treatments and

293
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,519
the mosquito spray and the pesticides

294
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,880
herbicides and the fungicides and all

295
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,800
the junk that's sprayed on our food and

296
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,360
everything puffing through the air from

297
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,079
everything from gasoline at the gas

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,720
station you inhaling from the fumes to

299
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,079
exhaust fumes you breathe in and Diesel

300
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,839
fumes you breathe in when you're out on

301
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,120
the street whatever ever it is we are

302
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,399
actually getting challenged to oxidize

303
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,279
and age quicker both in every single

304
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,800
aspect of our organs including our skin

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,360
and everything else in our body and then

306
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,199
we get degenerative we actually age

307
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,519
faster in so many different

308
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,360
ways now the whole thing about this is

309
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,040
really important to understand is

310
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,279
everybody everybody is trying to eat

311
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,079
better the best they

312
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,959
can everybody's trying to do something

313
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,639
for themselves now you'll see it it

314
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,519
maybe not everybody okay but almost

315
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,120
everybody is trying to actually choose

316
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,600
something differently that they consume

317
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,519
eat something differently that they

318
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,160
consume take something differently that

319
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,160
they can consume put something on their

320
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,839
skin put something on their body right

321
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,600
because everybody cares about what's

322
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,240
going inside their body now it's not

323
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,079
like years and years and years ago where

324
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,880
people really weren't caring about that

325
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,560
and they just did whatever and they

326
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,120
still do that now even people who take

327
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,279
care of themselves are still poison

328
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,880
themselves still drinking alcohol

329
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,120
they're still doing that and other

330
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,040
things too but regardless they're trying

331
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,680
to counter it right you'll see somebody

332
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,720
guzzling down caffeine drinking a bunch

333
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,600
of alcohol in the holidays eating a

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,440
bunch of rich chocolate and then in the

335
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
end they have this green juice in their

336
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
hand or they go to the health food store

337
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,560
and they grab a green juice from the

338
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,959
health food store a bottled one or

339
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,800
something and they're after their yoga

340
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,279
practice or their yoga class or whatever

341
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,320
they're actually drinking

342
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,800
their grain juice but at the same time

343
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,600
they're doing a lot of other things that

344
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,519
are actually harming them but they still

345
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,160
do at the same time care about what

346
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,360
their body is telling them caring about

347
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
what they're putting inside their body

348
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,880
and so what I like about the wild

349
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,040
blueberry is it takes it to a whole

350
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,000
another level a whole another level of

351
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,199
taking care of yourself and that's what

352
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,360
I love about it I remember being a child

353
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,240
in laying in the wild blueberry Fields

354
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,880
the fields filled with wild blueberries

355
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,160
and I would just lay in I would I would

356
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,199
turn purple and blue because my body

357
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,480
would be laying on top of the crop just

358
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,160
laying on top of those wild blueberries

359
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,800
and I used to go into the wild blueberry

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
Fields when I was younger and I used to

361
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,160
sit there on my knees hands and knees

362
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,079
and I would crawl through the field and

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,240
I would eat and eat and eat and eat till

364
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:26,240
I couldn't eat another one and then I

365
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,839
would fall just flip over on my back and

366
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,040
just lay there stuffed with wild blue BL

367
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,720
berries and as I was doing it I was

368
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,880
doing a lot of different things with

369
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,680
that like for instance there would be

370
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,639
like wild roses growing in and out of

371
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,800
the wild blueberries so Spirit of

372
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,920
compassion would say eat the wild rose

373
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,759
petals while you're eating the wild

374
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,199
blueberry so I'd make a mixture and I'd

375
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,759
Crawl Through the field making mixtures

376
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,560
I would take the wild blueberry and then

377
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,160
I would take some rose petals with it

378
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,160
put it there mix it up and I would eat

379
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,160
that like that right and I would do this

380
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,680
kind of thing and the whole time you

381
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,320
know my face is turning blue my body's

382
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,560
turning blue I'm squishing on them I'm

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
rolling in

384
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,000
them and it's really an

385
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,639
incredible spiritual

386
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,320
moment and I wish everybody could have

387
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,160
that opportunity but I know that that's

388
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,720
not easy it's not an easy opportunity to

389
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,320
have but I remember when I was younger

390
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,120
that I thought if this stuff could be

391
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,519
bottled up and to make it clear I don't

392
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,440
own Wyman's I don't have a percentage of

393
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,440
the Wyman's blueberry company and I want

394
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,920
to make this clear this is critical

395
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,839
because I heard somebody out there might

396
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,399
say like oh he's just trying to sell his

397
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,000
blueberry juice and I need this to be

398
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,920
absolutely clear with everyone I don't

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,040
have a share in the Wyman's

400
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,480
company I don't have a percentage of the

401
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,560
Wyman's company I'm not an owner I'm not

402
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,959
a

403
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,279
partner and that needs to be understood

404
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,319
I endorse Wyman's because it's the best

405
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:10,040
stuff there is and these guys do things

406
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:14,040
people don't do and this juice is insane

407
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,839
it's just insane and so I want people to

408
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,000
know that right CU it looks pretty

409
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
intense I got I you know I actually

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,120
purchased a bunch of cases I have all

411
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
this stuff right here in the counter I'm

412
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,920
going to make a bunch of drinks for you

413
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,800
guys I think I'm going to make four

414
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,240
different killer beverages out of this I

415
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,720
hope hopefully I do it right I do it

416
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,560
right but I want you to know that you

417
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
know I'm not an owner of the Wyman's

418
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,000
wild blueberry juice company or wild

419
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,720
blueberry company but I support these

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,880
guys I do I stand behind them and their

421
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
product I endorse them and rightfully so

422
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,680
because of what they do they got a heart

423
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,880
of gold and their stuff is amazing if

424
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,279
you can't watch this live on IG cuz I

425
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,839
see that everybody's getting kicked off

426
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,440
of IG and I see that right there go to

427
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,720
medical.com and you probably won't be

428
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
able to see me say that cuz cuz you've

429
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,040
already been kicked off or go to YouTube

430
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,799
or

431
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,280
Rumble IG is just keeping it like

432
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,880
kicking everybody off and just keeping

433
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,160
it down to like whatever they're doing

434
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,799
today all right so let's go into some

435
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,720
wild blueberries a little deeper and

436
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,919
stuff talk about something that's really

437
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,160
incredible all

438
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,400
right so you can burn down a wild

439
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,679
Blueberry

440
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,679
field and anything in that wild

441
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,240
Blueberry

442
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,400
Field anything won't come

443
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,280
back so as spring comes what will come

444
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,799
back instead are the wild

445
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,679
blueberries that's the kind of power

446
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,080
they have the adaptogenic power we're

447
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,160
talking about a survival mechanism that

448
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,400
if the Earth was

449
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,200
blazed if the Earth was blazed the wild

450
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:57,000
blueberry would come up and what really

451
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,280
crazy really crazy that if some

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,080
massive catastroph

453
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,200
catastrophic event happened where some

454
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:12,120
solar pulse solar

455
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:15,480
flare a huge ball of fire just balls out

456
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,480
of the Sun and barrels down towards

457
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,640
us whatever happens or if the planet

458
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,039
gets scorched for some

459
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,320
reason the wild blueberry will come back

460
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:31,000
up everything else will be

461
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,600
gone all the oak trees will be gone all

462
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,120
the acorns that grow oak trees would be

463
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,120
gone it's important to know all the

464
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,200
birch trees all the cherry trees all the

465
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,720
cedar all the

466
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,760
pine everything would be

467
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,760
gone just

468
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,240
annihilated and gone and what would

469
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,000
happen would be the wild blueberry would

470
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,440
just start coming up out of the earth

471
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,440
and would just start to grow and come up

472
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,039
out of the earth an oak tree won't

473
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,280
that's gone for good if the planet gets

474
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,159
scorched for some

475
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:18,960
reason if there's a nuclear war and the

476
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:21,360
planet just gets burned to the

477
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,440
ground the wild blueberry will be the

478
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,559
first to Peak its head it'll be the

479
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,799
first to come up you have to realize

480
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,640
what that is

481
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,320
and so what I like to think about is

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,600
that power it has and then I like to

483
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,640
think about that power in me like I want

484
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,080
that in me that's what I want I want

485
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,120
something that if it gets nuked it comes

486
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,360
up out of the ground I want something

487
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,919
that if it literally gets burned because

488
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:59,720
of some crazy event the moon crumbles

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,200
and starts to fall apart some Earth gets

490
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,559
thrown off its

491
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,880
axis something

492
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:11,400
happens or some alien race decides to

493
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,760
blow up the moon which by all means they

494
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,080
have power to do that and anything or

495
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,600
anything and the Earth was destroyed

496
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,919
over it the wild blueberry would still

497
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,960
come up out of the

498
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,799
ground that's what I'm talking about

499
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,919
it's that kind of power so I think about

500
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,000
that as I'm drinking and consuming the

501
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,720
wild blue bries so when I was a kid I

502
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,559
always thought about would it be amazing

503
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,440
if for some way somehow that can be

504
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,320
bottled those wild blueberries that are

505
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,520
once a year on that field in those

506
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:48,559
fields can get squeezed down and pressed

507
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,480
you know like pressed like oldtime apple

508
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:56,159
press style like

509
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:59,679
pressed and get pressed down into a

510
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,919
juice and gets put in here here like

511
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,960
that would be the biggest dream come

512
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,679
true for the health of people like to me

513
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,600
that would be the alltime greatest

514
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,279
dream to have that resource and have

515
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,400
that so I want to make a bunch of stuff

516
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,120
I to make a bunch of drinks I can talk

517
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,640

00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:58,840
put some orange zest in there

682
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,600

wet ingredient in but I don't have to

685
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,840
worry now cuz you can mix it up but you

686
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:11,880
don't have to freak out because the dry

687
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,240
ingredients were mixed up right I can't

688
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,320
wait to talk about the wild blueberry a

689
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,480
little bit more about the power it has

690
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,320
why it's so important to healing and

691
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,240
guess what that's right the wild

692
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,440
blueberry is in the hmds for a

693
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
reason do you know that it's a powerful

694
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,320
powerful binder

695
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,080
for the people that go he never talks

696
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,240
about binders he never talks about yeah

697
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,880
because the wild

698
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,799
blueberry is the most powerful of the

699
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,120
binders right all right so I'm mixing

700
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,240
this up now I want to get a little bit

701
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,679
of the

702
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
orange zest in there so what I do is I

703
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,919
take an orange I hope you guys are okay

704
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,440
with this can I throw it around a little

705
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,640
bit and what I do is I just peel it back

706
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,320
with a knife if you're okay right now

707
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,080
get a zest

708
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,080
greater what is it a zest tool this is

709
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,240
the way I do it now if you have somebody

710
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,960
that doesn't really like you orange zest

711
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,880

00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,159
blueberries in my smoothie I'm like

731
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,200
blueberries what kind of blueberries do

732
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,320
you put in there I just blueberries you

733
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,279
know I just bought them and it's

734
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,679
cultivated blueberries and it's like

735
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,480
okay well that's not going to help you

736
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,240
know what happens a lot of people don't

737
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,880
realize it and they do their

738
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:15,080
hmds with the cultivated

739
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,640
blueberry big big big big big problem if

740
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,279
that's the case if that's all you have

741
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,840
then what I recommend I'm going to cut

742
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
that up right now what I recommend is

743
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,440
when you do your

744
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,600
hmds you use a Blackberry you use a

745
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,320
cultivated black Blackberry a cultivated

746
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,960
Blackberry is getting much closer to

747
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,960
what say a wild blueberry could do it's

748
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,120
not the same thing it doesn't do the

749
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,159
same thing but the but the Blackberry if

750
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,640
but is better than the cultivated

751
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,919
blueberry I'm just going to tell you

752
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,440
right now this is important to know so

753
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,960
many people do their hmds and it's got

754
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,760
the cultivated blueberry and I feel bad

755
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,360
because it's not it it means that you're

756
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,600
not getting that maximum maximum

757
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,080
you know you're just not I want to just

758
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,200
I want to cut this down a little bit

759
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,960

972
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
to do the alcoholic beverage

973
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,599

974
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,760

blueberry juices it's actually

1232
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,400
incredible for emotional support

1233
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:49,440
emotional support for an evening out

1234
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,280
emotional support for an evening with

1235
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,280
family because it's providing brain help

1236
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,960
for your neurons think about that for a

1237
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,839
minute right there so the wild blueberry

1238
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,160
juice is going into the brain it's

1239
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:03,280
mainlining into the brain and it's

1240
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,040
providing all this kind of anthocyan INF

1241
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,040
filled glucose phytochemical compounds

1242
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,240
for your neurons specifically when you

1243
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,559
hear people say why do you eat so

1244
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,200
healthy why are you actually eating so

1245
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,040
healthy like forget it it's Thanksgiving

1246
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,640
just eat whatever just eat whatever

1247
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,920
everybody's eating eat all the butter

1248
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,079
and eat everything else why are you

1249
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,160
sticking to your medical medium protocol

1250
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:27,559
why are you eating medical medium stuff

1251
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,079
why are you eating a salad with spinach

1252
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,359
why are you having spinach soup right

1253
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:34,000
now everybody's having turkey all that

1254
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:36,839
pressure all that stress the wild

1255
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,599
blueberry juice kind of throws that all

1256
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,119
aside because people in the family they

1257
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,559
see that wild blueberry juice like this

1258
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,920
they'll see it like this and they'll be

1259
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,920
like what is that why is that are you

1260
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,760
drinking are you actually loosening up

1261
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,280
and you're drinking families actually

1262
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,119
feel like you're loosening up and you're

1263
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,760
actually like partying with them they

1264
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:58,760
won't be so like antagonistic to your

1265
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,559
lifestyle of healing and your lifestyle

1266
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,480
of eating the way you're eating and your

1267
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,520
celery juice drinking that they probably

1268
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,720
can't stand anymore or whatever it is

1269
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,000
that's happening with you know different

1270
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,799
people in your family and different

1271
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,400
people around your

1272
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:14,160
nucleus in your world and then what

1273
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,680

01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,079
getting out there they're just starting

1408
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,119
and all the work I did they're just

1409
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:11,079
starting to learn about it and it's true

1410
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:15,119
it's true people are just starting to

1411
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:17,480
like they're just starting to say

1412
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,599

01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:28,480
kills them to have to say

1416
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:33,160
I've totally been screwing up my whole

1417
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,240
career in health pushing the blueberry

1418
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,880

1419
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:41,440
like because it hurts it's like I don't

1420
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,960
want to be told I was wrong or stupid in

1421
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,440
the health realm I'm a guru and should

these years and didn't tell people it's

1425
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,240
the wild one that counts cuz I didn't

1426
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:59,520
know it's like all the gurus don't want

1427
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,160
to say it they don't want to say it it's

1428

seeds I stand correct

1568
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,120
it it's the one thing no one realizes I

1569
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,560
go through it's why the books don't

1570
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,440
contradict it's why eight gigantic

1571
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,960
medical Bibles can be put out and

1572
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,319
they're not

1573
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:31,600
contradictive that's why lives and

1574
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,880
lectures and and podcasts aren't

1575
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,560
contradictive like dicted like everybody

1576
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,359
else in the health scene it's because I

1577
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,199
get stand corrected by a voice I hear

1578
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:45,480
and it's the biggest pain in the butt

1579
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:49,920
ever if I call this a pit in here I get

1580
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,920
corrected by the voice that says it's a

1581
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,000
seed and that's why the books no one can

1582
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,440
touch the books

1583
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,880
there's no authors out there in the

1584
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,080
health realm that can actually do

1585
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:03,000
medical books like this with information

1586
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,360
that's detailed and not have some kind

1587
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,640
of problem they don't do it they just

1588
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,199
write eat better books and they

1589
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,600
contradict themselves in every sentence

1590
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:12,360

01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,800
with the strawberry it's so Advanced you

1633
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:07,960
guys think you're so

1634
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,360
smart think you're so smart but what you

1635
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,199
don't know is something Spirit taught me

1636
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,400
once

1637
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:16,719
again okay is you can eat the strawberry

1638
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,760
Leaf that's on top of the strawberry

1639
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,679
when it's out of your freaking

1640
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,520
Garden but you can't eat the strawberry

1641
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:28,800
Leaf when it's in the package that was

1642
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:31,560
in the store because

1643
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:34,520
bacteria gets trapped in between the

1644
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,320
strawberry Leaf even if you wash it and

1645
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,280
the

1646
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,960
strawberry and so you go there you're

1647
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,440
eating your strawberries you know from

1648
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,800
the store and all the bacteria is packed

1649
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:47,280
in between the leaf and the top of the

1650
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,960
strawberry everything from anything from

1651
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,960
traveling along with other like meats

1652
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,159
and chicken and God knows what and the

1653
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,040
big trucks and the big Carri

1654
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,199
in the 18 wheelers drippage everywhere

1655
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,280
and that salmonella can go right between

1656
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,600
the leaf of the strawberry and the

1657
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,239
strawberry so what I do is these aren't

1658
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,679
grown out of my garden I'm not going to

1659
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:09,960
eat the little strawberry top Leaf I'm

1660
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,600

1661
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,120
though I've washed

1662
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:18,199

realize the blood draw crisis they're

1726
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,080
drawing all this blood out of people who

1727
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,840
are chronically ill and literally

1728
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,760
killing them they're not monitoring it

1729
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,440
20 vials 10 vials 13 vials 7 vials

1730
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,520
pregnant women getting seven vials five

1731
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,800

1732
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,159
babies hemorrhagic shock in the

1733
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,199
womb and they lose their baby but nobody

1734
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,880
knows why because they had five vials

1735
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,639
seven vials 10 vials taken from them

1736
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,040

1739
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,159
multiple sclerosis took that info from

01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,560
me later after I published it 8 years

1741
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:00,239
ago 9 years ago actually almost 10 it

1742
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:02,719
was already pre-published in the phase

1743
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:04,480
way before it was even released medical

1744
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,280

1745
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,679
the chronic illness world and science

1746
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,239
takes the info day after day after day

1747
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:13,360
and they don't cite it back but we're

1748

Tok multi-million views per video

1813
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:17,199
putting out information Forefront

1814
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,760
information I have to admit I'm guilty

1815
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:21,159
of playing the drums on a couple of

1816
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,040
different episodes or different videos

1817
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:27,280
on Tik Tok I was playing the drums

1818
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:29,679
and remember and they completely deleted

1819
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,480
my account and they held me back from

1820
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,800
getting it so then after a year later we

1821
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,960
were able to open up a new account and

1822
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:39,880
they just turned off my

1823
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:42,480
live my live stream option they said

1824
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,480
they banned

1825
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,600
it that means you're doing powerful

1826
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,400
stuff in the world and that means you're

1827
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,199
moving mountains and that means you're

1828
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,000
changing the world and that means means

1829
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,199
500 million people we already know out

1830
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,960
there in the world are drinking celery

1831
01:20:56,199 --> 01:21:01,120
juice and that

1832
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:04,239
means that heavy metal detox is the

1833
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:06,199
number one word phrase in health right

1834
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,440
