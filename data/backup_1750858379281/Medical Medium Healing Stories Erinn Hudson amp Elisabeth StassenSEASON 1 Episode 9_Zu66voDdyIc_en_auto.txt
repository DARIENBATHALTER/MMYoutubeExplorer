[31.47 - 37.20] story and it's it's it's one that hits
[34.83 - 39.12] down to the core I mean really does
[37.20 - 40.53] because there's so many people like that
[39.12 - 42.78] I talked about that are on mattress
[40.53 - 44.67] island where they're sick and then they
[42.78 - 46.17] got lime and they got different problems
[44.67 - 47.76] and they're seeing doctor and doctor and
[46.17 - 49.65] doctor so you got a hang on because you
[47.76 - 51.60] got it you got to hear everything we're
[49.65 - 54.45] talking about I'm already getting a
[51.60 - 57.90] little a little emotional about it
[54.45 - 59.73] um but Erin Lee Catholic you know I want
[57.90 - 61.65] it I want you to tell a story how anyway
[59.73 - 66.66] how it all happened right here it came
[61.65 - 69.78] about where but so my husband and his
[66.66 - 71.34] sister are doing a podcast and they were
[69.78 - 73.74] talking about the people they want to
[71.34 - 75.93] get on the show and one of them was
[73.74 - 77.43] going to be Anthony Williams and of
[75.93 - 78.93] course you know my fingers were crossed
[77.43 - 81.69] himself I saw this happened this would
[78.93 - 85.59] be incredible Kate was really curious um
[81.69 - 88.08] and we were so fortunate for him to come
[85.59 - 90.09] on the show and do the podcast and kind
[88.08 - 92.04] of get a little insight on who you are
[90.09 - 93.78] as a person and just your whole story
[92.04 - 96.39] and everything and it was amazing and
[93.78 - 99.60] incredible and of course I wanted to be
[96.39 - 104.87] there and I got the chance to meet him
[99.60 - 106.86] and truly it was because of Elizabeth
[104.87 - 109.02] and I couldn't believe it was really
[106.86 - 111.57] happening but I did get to meet him and
[109.02 - 113.58] see how and you know just genuine and
[111.57 - 115.56] kinda incredible he was and immediately
[113.58 - 121.17] the first person that I called was
[115.56 - 123.44] Elizabeth because you can call me 30
[121.17 - 123.44] years
[124.80 - 129.30] oh my gosh you know I got to meet
[126.30 - 130.82] Anthony Williams and the reason I was so
[129.30 - 134.94] excited it was because she had
[130.82 - 139.23] introduced me to him years ago when she
[134.94 - 142.05] was going through an extremely dark and
[139.23 - 146.46] scary time and as a very close friend of
[142.05 - 148.32] hers it was hard it was hard as a friend
[146.46 - 152.55] feeling so helpless seeing your friend
[148.32 - 154.98] in so much pain and discomfort and the
[152.55 - 157.50] unknown and the fear of what was
[154.98 - 160.68] happening to her and her diagnosis of
[157.50 - 163.53] Lyme and how it was affecting her and
[160.68 - 166.83] seeing her you know go through all these
[163.53 - 168.90] different phases and and things that she
[166.83 - 172.08] was trying out anyways eventually a
[168.90 - 177.99] little tiny shift happened and there was
[172.08 - 179.58] a little hope in her voice and I was so
[177.99 - 181.83] relieved and so I remember her saying
[179.58 - 183.72] it's this book and it's the medical
[181.83 - 186.69] medium and and this was years ago this
[183.72 - 194.97] was 2015 no one early two-thousands was
[186.69 - 204.12] talking about it and it wasn't getting
[194.97 - 206.49] in the fight for truth I always say the
[204.12 - 212.43] trends don't they don't save lives it's
[206.49 - 216.78] it's it's one of you know my smartest
[212.43 - 219.81] most passionate you know friends that I
[216.78 - 221.52] know and extremely smart when it comes
[219.81 - 224.22] to nutrition and healing and that's her
[221.52 - 227.28] background for her to find something
[224.22 - 229.41] that really resonated with her and gave
[227.28 - 230.85] her a glimpse of hope I was like what is
[229.41 - 234.03] this and send it to me and I want to
[230.85 - 235.92] hear about it so I was lucky enough or
[234.03 - 239.16] not lucky enough but I wasn't dealing
[235.92 - 242.69] with anything as severe but I was having
[239.16 - 245.31] pretty significant GI issues which is
[242.69 - 248.84] the loveliest thing to talk about but
[245.31 - 248.84] like I don't have it
[249.32 - 253.97] fine and it takes over everything
[251.87 - 256.37] because anything that you're eating and
[253.97 - 258.68] anywhere you go you're constantly like
[256.37 - 261.02] oh no how's this gonna affect me and oh
[258.68 - 264.38] I can't go to this and you know you're
[261.02 - 265.97] just I was you know I naturally fin
[264.38 - 268.46] anybody that knows me from growing up I
[265.97 - 271.31] like crap I've wonderful genetics I'm
[268.46 - 274.85] thank God but I have this distended
[271.31 - 276.62] crazy stomach that no matter what I ate
[274.85 - 280.04] I thought oh I'm gonna shift and start
[276.62 - 281.93] to eat healthy but I was eating this you
[280.04 - 284.00] know kale salads and you know trying to
[281.93 - 286.13] not eat the junk food and it was
[284.00 - 288.62] actually making my stomach worse I was
[286.13 - 290.63] finally diagnosed with SIBO which is
[288.62 - 293.45] small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
[290.63 - 295.55] and this was about eight years ago and
[293.45 - 297.47] there wasn't a ton of information out
[295.55 - 299.81] there I kind of just grasp onto it
[297.47 - 304.40] because of a few of the symptoms that I
[299.81 - 306.53] had and anyways she I eat have started
[304.40 - 310.28] reading his book after she had told me
[306.53 - 311.08] and it was this page turning I couldn't
[310.28 - 315.49] put it down
[311.08 - 315.49] highlighting stuff I'm waking up Oliver
[319.00 - 327.73] my one small area that I was dealing
[321.80 - 331.88] with and it really it shifted the game
[327.73 - 334.43] for me when I saw her starting to heal
[331.88 - 337.04] and the things that she would tell me
[334.43 - 340.85] and the belief that I had because I was
[337.04 - 342.59] witnessing it firsthand and so of course
[340.85 - 345.71] for me I said well my gosh I'm going to
[342.59 - 350.15] try this this is and after years of
[345.71 - 352.22] struggling and nothing sticking and kind
[350.15 - 354.05] of just settling into the idea that okay
[352.22 - 356.24] this is going to be this is it this is
[354.05 - 358.13] my my battle and of course it's not the
[356.24 - 362.42] end of the world but I'm gonna have to
[358.13 - 366.92] deal with it and then I tried celery
[362.42 - 373.45] juice in my blender with a nut milk in
[366.92 - 373.45] the earlier crazy yes sir
[375.20 - 380.24] and it was a big you know juicer was
[378.41 - 383.06] expensive I was like I'm gonna try this
[380.24 - 387.53] out anyways it was such a game changer
[383.06 - 389.99] for me it and it was instant and so I
[387.53 - 391.22] like it's one of those things where you
[389.99 - 392.87] know people say oh that's hilarious and
[391.22 - 394.76] I want to try it and I'm gonna you know
[392.87 - 398.05] do this and that when you really have
[394.76 - 400.70] something that is an ailment that
[398.05 - 403.37] nothing else is working for and it seems
[400.70 - 405.32] so simple yeah yeah it's not simplistic
[403.37 - 407.32] because the book breaks it down and what
[405.32 - 409.64] it's doing and what it's replacing and
[407.32 - 414.62] replenishing and if that really made
[409.64 - 416.96] sense to me for SIBO but it was instant
[414.62 - 424.52] and it was amazing and I committed I was
[416.96 - 427.19] pretty good more people that just it was
[424.52 - 430.58] it was so simple meaning I didn't have
[427.19 - 432.50] to do some crazy you know take all this
[430.58 - 434.30] out and only do this and do that it it
[432.50 - 442.25] was tangible does that makes sense
[434.30 - 443.93] and of course yeah coming up in February
[442.25 - 451.76] will be a year he was announcing his new
[443.93 - 453.80] book which was coming out and so in the
[451.76 - 456.64] title if you can see it does some Siebel
[453.80 - 459.11] on it it was the first thing that came
[456.64 - 461.00] in my direction yeah you know we'll see
[459.11 - 465.46] what information on it and that got in
[461.00 - 467.99] healing and deliver and so when I got
[465.46 - 469.22] went on to order my book of course it
[467.99 - 476.06] said oh it's not coming out until
[469.22 - 478.67] October and I was you know pre-ordered
[476.06 - 483.86] it and it came and into Christmas
[478.67 - 484.70] literally yeah I know every book on here
[483.86 - 487.43] I've read them all they're all
[484.70 - 490.07] incredible this one really resonated
[487.43 - 491.60] with me and I know there's the new one
[490.07 - 493.43] coming on I can't wait for that I feel
[491.60 - 495.59] like there's just more information and
[493.43 - 497.99] more knowledge and people want it that's
[495.59 - 503.59] a little bit of my story which obviously
[497.99 - 503.59] led me to to your story which
[507.56 - 514.16] you know with the in the digestive
[510.89 - 516.65] problems and it it can take over your
[514.16 - 519.50] life like really people don't realize it
[516.65 - 521.09] dress and you know lack of sleep and
[519.50 - 523.67] you're worried about it and what am i
[521.09 - 528.41] eating and what am i not even and I also
[523.67 - 529.79] ended up doing the detox movie as well I
[528.41 - 535.52] always have to have one cuz I always
[529.79 - 537.82] have one every day again super easy to
[535.52 - 542.18] make super tangible and really good and
[537.82 - 545.36] that for me and like those two I would
[542.18 - 546.71] say together was a game changer and a
[545.36 - 549.35] lot of the stuff that happened along the
[546.71 - 552.41] way I can talk with Beth too but it just
[549.35 - 554.03] made sense and so for me it was let me
[552.41 - 556.82] read this book does it resonate with you
[554.03 - 560.59] are you you know where are you in your
[556.82 - 563.78] journey I wasn't in the depths of where
[560.59 - 566.75] but I was struggling and it was hard and
[563.78 - 569.48] there weren't a lot of answers and but
[566.75 - 571.88] we don't want a person to go into the
[569.48 - 573.71] depths of work Elizabeth you know where
[571.88 - 577.97] Beth was we don't want anything that's a
[573.71 - 580.49] thing you're struggling as it was that's
[577.97 - 582.74] a thing if we don't get the answers we
[580.49 - 584.48] need we can go backwards more and then
[582.74 - 588.19] something else happens and some you know
[584.48 - 591.17] and it all kind of falls apart one thing
[588.19 - 592.58] when you're doing one thing you know you
[591.17 - 594.89] you want people to pay attention to
[592.58 - 597.35] their bodies what when symptoms start to
[594.89 - 598.97] come up and not sort of you know ignore
[597.35 - 600.44] them and just you know stay on the
[598.97 - 601.94] standard American diet and not do
[600.44 - 603.80] anything these are warning signs that
[601.94 - 606.86] your body is giving you that it's
[603.80 - 610.73] unhappy with the status quo or you know
[606.86 - 612.80] your current diet and so for me mine you
[610.73 - 617.12] know if I really look at it I was sort
[612.80 - 620.89] of set up for being taken out by disease
[617.12 - 625.28] I was sort of emotionally spiritually
[620.89 - 627.86] mentally and physically broken down and
[625.28 - 630.53] and then it just kind of woke up
[627.86 - 633.26] something in me and overnight I was in a
[630.53 - 634.58] completely different body but I look at
[633.26 - 636.89] people that are dealing with you know
[634.58 - 638.79] things that were you know painful and
[636.89 - 641.76] uncomfortable and you know
[638.79 - 643.62] Sol and I really want to implore people
[641.76 - 646.35] to pay attention pay attention to your
[643.62 - 649.38] body now before you end up in bed like I
[646.35 - 652.71] was oh yeah that's no way to live yeah I
[649.38 - 654.90] mean that's like real like yeah here's
[652.71 - 656.37] what you went through it's unbelievable
[654.90 - 659.43] and if you want to share with everybody
[656.37 - 662.94] and I think I think it's it's the Lyme
[659.43 - 665.10] disease world yes would always when when
[662.94 - 669.09] you're talking to me about it it just
[665.10 - 671.60] brought me back to Lyme disease being
[669.09 - 676.23] still nothing but a confusion out there
[671.60 - 678.90] a wake of 40 years almost of people
[676.23 - 680.58] suffering yeah and not getting answers
[678.90 - 685.74] and getting bombarded with antibiotics
[680.58 - 688.62] and so I had to get the truth out I
[685.74 - 692.85] risked my life doing it but then people
[688.62 - 695.37] don't realize that but you know you know
[692.85 - 698.19] and now it's actually changed the
[695.37 - 700.20] movement so ingre in a great way the
[698.19 - 702.18] people human but I'd love for you to
[700.20 - 704.70] tell a story because I think people can
[702.18 - 706.62] learn from your healing experience and
[704.70 - 709.32] your story how it started when you just
[706.62 - 711.51] got hit with it yeah it's so
[709.32 - 713.64] overwhelming and I don't I'm aware of
[711.51 - 715.89] how much time it would take to tell the
[713.64 - 721.32] whole story but I'm going to try to try
[715.89 - 725.46] to focus well I think it really started
[721.32 - 730.82] when I was an exhausted mom with a baby
[725.46 - 734.58] who was one and a half at home and I
[730.82 - 738.96] found myself pregnant again and I went
[734.58 - 741.60] through a miscarriage and I had to have
[738.96 - 743.91] a surgery following it and I was really
[741.60 - 746.10] down at that point I was really I was
[743.91 - 749.30] exhausted I was still you know nursing
[746.10 - 751.89] my baby I found myself like pregnant was
[749.30 - 755.40] you know another pregnancy and then I
[751.89 - 757.08] lost it and I you know I'm I was a whole
[755.40 - 759.96] I was already a holistic health coach
[757.08 - 762.24] and a nutritionist I barely ever took it
[759.96 - 763.86] I'd film before and all of a sudden I'm
[762.24 - 765.81] getting this surgery you know I'm you
[763.86 - 767.06] know having all these drugs pumped into
[765.81 - 770.63] me and stuff in
[767.06 - 774.20] and I'm really sad and grieving and just
[770.63 - 777.35] kind of upset you know mad at the world
[774.20 - 779.54] that this happened and it that parts a
[777.35 - 781.91] little hard to talk about but I know
[779.54 - 782.93] that when I woke up the next day I was
[781.91 - 786.29] in a different body
[782.93 - 789.77] I had pins and needles and I had heart
[786.29 - 794.77] palpitations and I had massive anxiety
[789.77 - 798.47] and you know insomnia and burning skin
[794.77 - 799.85] just a different a completely different
[798.47 - 802.31] body and I thought oh this is just like
[799.85 - 803.87] you know I'm everyone says like oh
[802.31 - 805.46] you're grieving you know you're you're
[803.87 - 807.32] anxious you know it's hormones your
[805.46 - 809.93] hormones you know I had had hot flashes
[807.32 - 811.97] I had night sweats it's just it's gonna
[809.93 - 814.64] go away it's gonna go away when you know
[811.97 - 818.21] the drugs wear off it's gonna go away
[814.64 - 819.80] when you you know you just need to cry
[818.21 - 821.57] about this loss that you went through
[819.80 - 825.38] and you know just get back to your life
[821.57 - 827.24] and it didn't happen I spent about a
[825.38 - 830.99] year running around to different doctors
[827.24 - 833.51] I went to you know all sorts of doctors
[830.99 - 837.74] and then about at the end of the year I
[833.51 - 839.57] got a Lyme diagnosis and I had had Lyme
[837.74 - 842.66] disease when I was a college student at
[839.57 - 845.06] 21 and I had had a diagnosis then and
[842.66 - 847.97] but I've been it been dormant for you
[845.06 - 851.00] know 18 years and I'd lived a really
[847.97 - 852.32] normal life so it was really kind of
[851.00 - 854.45] surprising to me I was like well there's
[852.32 - 856.04] no tick I didn't get bit again is it a
[854.45 - 857.42] reinfection was it there the whole time
[856.04 - 860.74] you know I didn't really have the
[857.42 - 864.68] answers but I know that for the next
[860.74 - 869.00] really you know several months I was
[864.68 - 870.86] running around everywhere searching
[869.00 - 872.09] going to different doctors going to
[870.86 - 874.88] different Lyme doctors going to
[872.09 - 877.36] different healers you know New York LA
[874.88 - 879.98] like different parts of California just
[877.36 - 882.47] the way that I can describe it is just
[879.98 - 883.61] panic just you know can you help me can
[882.47 - 886.16] you help me can you help me can you help
[883.61 - 888.38] me and I would get these large protocols
[886.16 - 891.08] back of things that I was supposed to
[888.38 - 893.06] take and I I couldn't put it together I
[891.08 - 895.67] didn't have the mental capacity to
[893.06 - 898.16] follow it and I know that sounds crazy
[895.67 - 900.32] but I I couldn't like follow the
[898.16 - 906.89] doctor's orders because
[900.32 - 909.71] I needed something very simple and I did
[906.89 - 912.98] eventually go on one protocol that
[909.71 - 916.43] really really made me go downhill very
[912.98 - 918.38] very quickly and I wasn't really able to
[916.43 - 921.68] use my legs in the way that I always had
[918.38 - 923.36] I couldn't get out of bed and I would
[921.68 - 925.07] just sit there I had to have someone
[923.36 - 929.09] come take care of my daughter
[925.07 - 931.25] I had a cane at one point briefly but
[929.09 - 934.61] you know there was to help just to help
[931.25 - 936.20] walk but I I it was really getting that
[934.61 - 938.48] getting the cane and look seeing at my
[936.20 - 940.63] house that I was like instinctively
[938.48 - 944.24] thinking you know I'm a young woman and
[940.63 - 946.40] I would see people in the doctor's
[944.24 - 948.29] office like that were you know stage for
[946.40 - 950.06] a neurological line which was what I had
[948.29 - 951.26] and I remember my doctor saying like oh
[950.06 - 951.80] you're not in a wheelchair yet you're
[951.26 - 954.95] fine
[951.80 - 957.10] and I remember thinking oh there's so
[954.95 - 961.34] many things but I remember saying like
[957.10 - 962.69] okay you know there's there's got to be
[961.34 - 964.34] another way there's got to be something
[962.69 - 965.90] I can do and I think because it was I
[964.34 - 967.85] had already gone to nutrition school and
[965.90 - 970.40] I already like you know already love to
[967.85 - 972.50] cook and stuff I I was just sort of
[970.40 - 976.76] praying I guess for something else and
[972.50 - 979.04] then they never dry joining this um
[976.76 - 982.58] Ellie Lyme support group and there was
[979.04 - 984.53] this guy on line and in the support
[982.58 - 986.57] group that was very controversial and
[984.53 - 988.31] people were fighting about it and
[986.57 - 991.82] they're probably still fighting about it
[988.31 - 993.17] but I just remember you know I kind of
[991.82 - 995.69] had that personality of like when
[993.17 - 996.11] something is frisky I want to know about
[995.69 - 997.58] it
[996.11 - 999.92] you know what is it I just want to
[997.58 - 1002.17] decide for myself and sort of bring in
[999.92 - 1003.67] the information and go how do I feel
[1002.17 - 1006.64] about this does this make sense or can I
[1003.67 - 1009.04] read between the lines or you know so I
[1006.64 - 1010.78] that's how I you know started searching
[1009.04 - 1012.34] a little bit and so I just I bought this
[1010.78 - 1019.93] book this was the first book but if I
[1012.34 - 1023.95] say the guy online controversial I'm
[1019.93 - 1025.54] sorry but so so I just I Amazon this
[1023.95 - 1028.24] book and I remember reading it and
[1025.54 - 1029.26] literally crying and telling my husband
[1028.24 - 1033.96] same thing like
[1029.26 - 1036.52] No oh my god no yes yes this sort of
[1033.96 - 1039.67] intuitive knowing of like this is
[1036.52 - 1042.88] explaining what I am feeling inside and
[1039.67 - 1044.35] I don't care what anybody thinks I don't
[1042.88 - 1047.38] care what's normal I don't care what's
[1044.35 - 1049.42] being taught or told I know that what
[1047.38 - 1052.60] I'm doing right now is making me go down
[1049.42 - 1055.12] down down and I would call my Lyme
[1052.60 - 1057.13] doctor and say I really don't think this
[1055.12 - 1059.08] is right and he would say you get you
[1057.13 - 1060.55] get much worse before you get better
[1059.08 - 1062.74] you're gonna get worse before you get
[1060.55 - 1065.05] better and maybe there there is you know
[1062.74 - 1067.06] detoxing and stuff on any protocol but
[1065.05 - 1067.81] you're not you're not supposed to get
[1067.06 - 1070.03] much worse
[1067.81 - 1077.02] we have to get better that's only
[1070.03 - 1079.81] because they don't know anything you
[1077.02 - 1083.71] know I had to basically shut out all of
[1079.81 - 1086.26] that and just go I know my body I've
[1083.71 - 1088.21] been in this body for you know a long
[1086.26 - 1092.26] time and I know this is not right
[1088.21 - 1095.35] and maybe that work for someone and
[1092.26 - 1098.28] that's their story but this is not
[1095.35 - 1101.50] working for me and I remember literally
[1098.28 - 1103.84] like walking and going like God give me
[1101.50 - 1106.33] a sign if I'm supposed to get off the
[1103.84 - 1108.58] you know standard protocol and get on
[1106.33 - 1111.31] this give me a sign and I had I was
[1108.58 - 1113.47] taking a walk and I went back to my car
[1111.31 - 1116.50] where I was walking and one of my best
[1113.47 - 1117.88] friends Chris had texted me a picture of
[1116.50 - 1119.35] this book and was like I was just
[1117.88 - 1120.94] thinking about you have you checked out
[1119.35 - 1123.22] this guy I think you should check it out
[1120.94 - 1126.70] and they just asked for a sign so it's
[1123.22 - 1128.56] like okay I am getting it on getting off
[1126.70 - 1133.93] of that today and I'm switching to this
[1128.56 - 1138.16] and within about four weeks I was out of
[1133.93 - 1139.63] bed I I was making I started slow it was
[1138.16 - 1140.77] like you know okay I can start my
[1139.63 - 1145.93] kitchen I'm just going to do the celery
[1140.77 - 1148.87] juice I'm just gonna do this purple
[1145.93 - 1151.39] murky looking it's actually quite
[1148.87 - 1153.85] delicious oh yeah um I made it
[1151.39 - 1156.43] religiously for two years actually and I
[1153.85 - 1157.65] just like I was like autopilot I just
[1156.43 - 1159.84] got up and I did
[1157.65 - 1160.86] because you knew you knew you knew the
[1159.84 - 1162.93] truth was there
[1160.86 - 1165.36] you knew somewhere in your heart that
[1162.93 - 1167.64] this is yes this is the right track but
[1165.36 - 1169.77] I had to stay with the face of it like I
[1167.64 - 1171.27] had to faithfully kind of make it even
[1169.77 - 1173.19] when I wasn't feeling like it I had to
[1171.27 - 1175.17] just faithfully make it and my healing
[1173.19 - 1177.06] really came in shifts you know there was
[1175.17 - 1178.41] an immediate like oh my gosh I have more
[1177.06 - 1179.97] energy oh my gosh I can get out of bed
[1178.41 - 1181.38] oh my gosh I can make stuff in my
[1179.97 - 1183.45] kitchen but you know when you lay in bed
[1181.38 - 1185.76] for a long time and he tells so many
[1183.45 - 1187.14] people this that yeah once you start
[1185.76 - 1188.82] getting better though you're gonna get
[1187.14 - 1190.41] tired again because you're using all
[1188.82 - 1191.88] these muscles you didn't use yeah now
[1190.41 - 1194.28] you're in the kitchen and you're being
[1191.88 - 1196.32] able to function but then BOOM
[1194.28 - 1198.90] whoa now I'm doing so much more than a
[1196.32 - 1200.52] happen I'm not yet ridden but you know
[1198.90 - 1202.29] yeah then you get kind of kicked back
[1200.52 - 1204.27] and it gets scary but then you're moving
[1202.29 - 1206.34] forward even more did that happen oh
[1204.27 - 1208.08] yeah there was at least a year
[1206.34 - 1209.49] if I'm honest there was Italy because my
[1208.08 - 1212.43] healing was like two and a half three
[1209.49 - 1217.14] years there there was at least a year
[1212.43 - 1219.33] where I my my mind it was like I woke up
[1217.14 - 1222.75] from a 20-year nap my mind was sharp and
[1219.33 - 1224.19] clear my spirit was so excited to get
[1222.75 - 1226.50] out there and do the things that I
[1224.19 - 1229.05] wasn't able to do even before I got sick
[1226.50 - 1231.66] and you know I think I was like you know
[1229.05 - 1234.21] just didn't know you know and and my
[1231.66 - 1237.15] body was just like nope you're not doing
[1234.21 - 1238.32] it today like you so I was sort of and I
[1237.15 - 1240.81] think that kind of helped me because
[1238.32 - 1242.73] mentally and spiritually once I had that
[1240.81 - 1246.54] hope for healing I could kind of like
[1242.73 - 1248.43] vision myself in the future like just
[1246.54 - 1250.68] one in college stuff I'm gonna travel
[1248.43 - 1252.45] I'm gonna you know when you're in bed or
[1250.68 - 1259.74] even just not feeling well for so long
[1252.45 - 1264.81] it's like you're in your own prison if
[1259.74 - 1267.72] you have amazing which I did but you
[1264.81 - 1270.27] still it was this feeling of like I'm so
[1267.72 - 1271.95] lonely because no one else knows like
[1270.27 - 1273.57] what my body's feeling you have the
[1271.95 - 1276.72] elements that we're going on and you
[1273.57 - 1278.79] don't you let your soup or something
[1276.72 - 1281.25] that people would be like we look good
[1278.79 - 1283.14] yeah you're standing up yeah you look
[1281.25 - 1285.27] good in a photograph
[1283.14 - 1287.58] actually just took me six hours to get
[1285.27 - 1289.68] up and out of bed and function to get
[1287.58 - 1291.00] myself showered and dressed and I have
[1289.68 - 1292.62] like a good like three hours a day
[1291.00 - 1294.87] before have to go take a nap and come
[1292.62 - 1296.55] back do you know any like it wears when
[1294.87 - 1298.35] you were you were on a clock and that
[1296.55 - 1300.84] clock was wait a minute what can I do in
[1298.35 - 1302.46] this 45 minutes in this one hour before
[1300.84 - 1304.77] I'm flatlined in the bed for a while
[1302.46 - 1306.96] yeah and the nervous system is shutting
[1304.77 - 1308.61] down and you're just you just know
[1306.96 - 1310.08] you're not you know you know you can't
[1308.61 - 1312.24] push yourself cuz you you've probably
[1310.08 - 1314.58] learned that if you did you just really
[1312.24 - 1316.80] flat low it my nervous game is collapsed
[1314.58 - 1319.56] yeah in my dream everything you know if
[1316.80 - 1321.48] I did too much and the adrenals start
[1319.56 - 1323.64] kicking in everything I would literally
[1321.48 - 1326.10] not sleep for three days and you know my
[1323.64 - 1327.96] husband would be like did you know maybe
[1326.10 - 1329.94] two or three days just because when I
[1327.96 - 1332.28] was stuck the nervous system gets that
[1329.94 - 1335.82] weak and when you're dealing with this
[1332.28 - 1337.14] and what happens is it gets that weak to
[1335.82 - 1339.45] the point where you can't sleep
[1337.14 - 1342.63] regardless of how tired you are it's
[1339.45 - 1343.65] hell and doctors don't understand how
[1342.63 - 1345.57] this works they don't know why the
[1343.65 - 1346.83] patient isn't sleeping or not don't say
[1345.57 - 1349.77] oh maybe it's a Hertz heimer
[1346.83 - 1351.42] or maybe it's this or they have no idea
[1349.77 - 1353.19] it's not the doctors fault but it's it's
[1351.42 - 1355.35] the industry science the research has no
[1353.19 - 1358.38] idea about anything this is just in with
[1355.35 - 1360.81] this and so when you push yourself too
[1358.38 - 1362.73] hard too it could even get worse where
[1360.81 - 1364.35] you don't sleep even more even though
[1362.73 - 1369.91] you're exhausted because every nerve in
[1364.35 - 1373.02] the body hurts too for example or buzzes
[1369.91 - 1373.02] [Music]
[1373.79 - 1382.86] it was it was it forces you and I told
[1380.34 - 1384.21] people to in the past or it forces you
[1382.86 - 1386.76] have told a lot of professionals this
[1384.21 - 1390.03] because they just don't understand how
[1386.76 - 1392.25] you're feeling I said it's a prison when
[1390.03 - 1395.19] you're laying in bed if you don't relax
[1392.25 - 1397.56] the nerves and let them calm down yeah
[1395.19 - 1400.14] for all the buzzing and the humming just
[1397.56 - 1402.54] if you don't do that you will you will
[1400.14 - 1404.43] be in real trouble yeah you you won't be
[1402.54 - 1405.96] able to just get into the bathroom I
[1404.43 - 1407.61] remember I went to someone's wedding in
[1405.96 - 1408.38] New York and just getting on the plane
[1407.61 - 1410.93] and land
[1408.38 - 1413.63] I was like I looked at my husband and
[1410.93 - 1416.39] every part of my body was like vibrating
[1413.63 - 1417.47] and I was like I'm like the lights were
[1416.39 - 1420.05] shutting out yeah
[1417.47 - 1421.79] it was really really scary and I spent
[1420.05 - 1423.17] the entire trip and went to the wedding
[1421.79 - 1424.52] and they spent the entire trip in New
[1423.17 - 1425.93] York in bed while my husband went and
[1424.52 - 1427.67] did all this fun New York stuff that I
[1425.93 - 1429.11] planned this with my daughter I mean
[1427.67 - 1430.28] when you're young like this you're
[1429.11 - 1433.13] dealing what does he must have thought
[1430.28 - 1436.25] you were dying I for sure thought I was
[1433.13 - 1438.44] dying I mean I yeah I told my husband
[1436.25 - 1440.06] there were many nights that I said I
[1438.44 - 1441.41] don't know if I'm gonna make it through
[1440.06 - 1446.09] the night I think I'm gonna die tonight
[1441.41 - 1447.71] that my symptoms were so bad and I would
[1446.09 - 1449.21] just look at my daughter sleeping and
[1447.71 - 1451.94] just say like I don't know how much time
[1449.21 - 1453.53] I have with you but I love you and so
[1451.94 - 1456.59] glad I got to be here with you and when
[1453.53 - 1458.54] I was lying in bed listening to someone
[1456.59 - 1460.64] else laugh and take care of her whether
[1458.54 - 1463.13] it was my mother-in-law who was a saint
[1460.64 - 1466.19] to come all the time or we hired someone
[1463.13 - 1467.60] at one point to help us and or my
[1466.19 - 1471.74] husband like they would take her to the
[1467.60 - 1473.63] park all I wanted was to be the one to
[1471.74 - 1475.31] be the one to take her to the park to be
[1473.63 - 1480.74] the one to push the stroller to be the
[1475.31 - 1482.78] one to make her dinner and and I I at
[1480.74 - 1485.87] one point really said to my husband like
[1482.78 - 1488.00] I don't I think this is it and I just I
[1485.87 - 1492.47] don't know what to do I want to be here
[1488.00 - 1494.81] for that and so my being a mommy was my
[1492.47 - 1497.00] motivator and it's still my motivator I
[1494.81 - 1499.49] mean I am now at the point where I can
[1497.00 - 1501.20] eat almost anything so I just want if
[1499.49 - 1502.73] anyone can't eat anything I want you to
[1501.20 - 1505.04] know that three years ago I couldn't eat
[1502.73 - 1507.80] anything no gluten no dairy no sugar no
[1505.04 - 1509.27] alcohol no processed food no nothing I
[1507.80 - 1514.06] know you're not supposed eat eggs I'm
[1509.27 - 1517.52] not good thing but I do eat and enjoy
[1514.06 - 1520.31] everything but I know that I'm gonna end
[1517.52 - 1523.13] right back up where I started if I'm not
[1520.31 - 1526.82] careful so now this died all these books
[1523.13 - 1529.10] I have all of these books and you know
[1526.82 - 1530.48] sometimes it's 20% of my diet sometimes
[1529.10 - 1532.76] it's a hundred percent of my diet
[1530.48 - 1534.41] sometimes it's 80% it's always there I'm
[1532.76 - 1536.57] always working in the stuff but you
[1534.41 - 1539.05] worked hard at the beginning no you
[1536.57 - 1539.05] wouldn't
[1539.14 - 1542.05] you knew it was right at the beginning
[1540.58 - 1544.39] when you were getting those results you
[1542.05 - 1547.50] just had to stay with it and yeah and
[1544.39 - 1549.85] the thing is is to do that while
[1547.50 - 1552.40] emotionally I mean you already went
[1549.85 - 1553.87] through emotional I mean hell and back
[1552.40 - 1555.76] yeah or them
[1553.87 - 1559.27] I mean you already went through so much
[1555.76 - 1562.68] and then to have a sickness come at the
[1559.27 - 1565.75] same time yeah you know and you probably
[1562.68 - 1568.27] I think my my defences were sort of
[1565.75 - 1572.62] immune system came down absolutely yeah
[1568.27 - 1574.78] we the goal is to know what to do so we
[1572.62 - 1577.48] have the right to be emotional and we
[1574.78 - 1580.51] have the right to experience a tragedy
[1577.48 - 1583.18] or a loss or a hardship that we have the
[1580.51 - 1585.43] right for that because it's it's it's
[1583.18 - 1587.89] worse than salt in the wound if you if
[1585.43 - 1589.93] you if you have to experience something
[1587.89 - 1592.00] that's happening in our lives and then
[1589.93 - 1594.43] we get kicked down with sickness on top
[1592.00 - 1596.62] of it and then that's one salt round of
[1594.43 - 1598.60] salt in the wound and then the doctors
[1596.62 - 1600.58] don't know what's going on in going on
[1598.60 - 1602.92] in your body the professionals
[1600.58 - 1605.11] that's another round of salt and as
[1602.92 - 1607.57] fears people around us don't know what's
[1605.11 - 1609.70] going on so thank God you have a friend
[1607.57 - 1612.42] like there and because that's when you
[1609.70 - 1616.00] find out who your friends are - oh yeah
[1612.42 - 1619.72] true oh yeah I I have to thank my
[1616.00 - 1622.57] girlfriends and my family were amazing
[1619.72 - 1625.30] they you know Aaron's been my like you
[1622.57 - 1629.11] know sister and earthly guardian angel
[1625.30 - 1630.91] for thirty years and you know just she
[1629.11 - 1632.89] all of my friends all my girlfriends
[1630.91 - 1634.54] really walked through it with me and my
[1632.89 - 1639.37] mother and my mother-in-law my sisters
[1634.54 - 1641.65] my husband went through so much and you
[1639.37 - 1643.69] know you do realize who your who your
[1641.65 - 1645.40] people are and who gets it and who
[1643.69 - 1647.86] doesn't get it at the same time it's a
[1645.40 - 1650.17] really personal journey and the only way
[1647.86 - 1652.75] that I got well was to really block
[1650.17 - 1656.68] everyone out and and it taught me
[1652.75 - 1659.50] boundaries of deciding what was going
[1656.68 - 1661.33] going in instead of looking outside for
[1659.50 - 1663.10] answers like just being here with my
[1661.33 - 1665.47] book and being with my like I have a
[1663.10 - 1669.82] little like supplement apothecary now
[1665.47 - 1672.10] and my my frigerator and you know just
[1669.82 - 1672.80] if I could do nothing else I could eat
[1672.10 - 1676.11] it
[1672.80 - 1678.54] and that would be like a healing healing
[1676.11 - 1681.00] thing for me I know once when spirit of
[1678.54 - 1683.34] compassion when I was younger said you
[1681.00 - 1685.80] know in these books when when we're able
[1683.34 - 1687.27] to do these books cuz it I had to help
[1685.80 - 1688.95] so many people for so many decades
[1687.27 - 1692.58] before I could even do the books to get
[1688.95 - 1695.07] this to you and Spirit said to me this
[1692.58 - 1697.23] is medical Scripture and I was like well
[1695.07 - 1699.54] what do you mean as I was writing this
[1697.23 - 1701.88] down and spirit said people are going to
[1699.54 - 1705.24] they're going to hold on to this and
[1701.88 - 1709.76] read these words and it's going to get
[1705.24 - 1713.00] them through a hard time and so I
[1709.76 - 1715.20] realized even then right there that okay
[1713.00 - 1716.88] this you know this is what it's about
[1715.20 - 1719.01] it's about making sure that when you
[1716.88 - 1720.81] were your alone in the world of sickness
[1719.01 - 1722.67] because even if we have family around us
[1720.81 - 1724.95] and we have friends around us and we
[1722.67 - 1728.49] have good physicians around us yeah it
[1724.95 - 1730.77] doesn't mean we can be saved when you're
[1728.49 - 1731.91] that sick because you just where do you
[1730.77 - 1734.37] go what do you do
[1731.91 - 1737.07] even yeah and that's and and I said I
[1734.37 - 1739.65] remember I said I my Lyme doctor one of
[1737.07 - 1741.60] three that I went to I went in and I
[1739.65 - 1743.46] started I must have been healing because
[1741.60 - 1745.53] I was trying to get pissed off and when
[1743.46 - 1746.88] you are you know suffering and you're
[1745.53 - 1749.31] down and then you start to get a little
[1746.88 - 1751.62] like fight and you a little like anger a
[1749.31 - 1753.54] little you know that's actually you're
[1751.62 - 1755.40] moving up the emotional guidance scale
[1753.54 - 1757.41] and you're getting towards like you're
[1755.40 - 1759.30] fighting for yourself and I remember
[1757.41 - 1761.82] going in and going you know what you
[1759.30 - 1763.77] need you need to treat forget about Lyme
[1761.82 - 1766.25] you need to treat my fear disease
[1763.77 - 1768.90] because now I'm in fear I'm in this
[1766.25 - 1770.82] scary Lyme world and there's just so
[1768.90 - 1771.84] much noise and they know how to block it
[1770.82 - 1772.77] all out and I don't know what I'm
[1771.84 - 1773.88] supposed to be doing and you're not
[1772.77 - 1775.49] telling me what I'm doing and I'm not
[1773.88 - 1777.93] feeling better and it was just like
[1775.49 - 1781.20] fighting for myself and being excited
[1777.93 - 1784.17] myself in my life and you know you don't
[1781.20 - 1786.57] have all the answers and I was off about
[1784.17 - 1787.62] it and I think that helped does your
[1786.57 - 1788.85] same fighting for yourself because the
[1787.62 - 1790.35] truth is you were really lucky to have
[1788.85 - 1791.70] people around you they were supportive
[1790.35 - 1794.91] and I think a lot of people don't
[1791.70 - 1797.55] yeah because or whatever it is we're
[1794.91 - 1800.76] grow up or who's around that people
[1797.55 - 1802.79] believe they don't believe people don't
[1800.76 - 1804.47] believe they think it's in their head
[1802.79 - 1806.24] Oh case they don't get what's going on
[1804.47 - 1808.43] they just don't understand as you say
[1806.24 - 1812.06] you know medical medium a lot of people
[1808.43 - 1815.39] want to be skeptical skeptical but for
[1812.06 - 1817.64] me I was like this is you know you
[1815.39 - 1819.86] you've learned yourself and you know
[1817.64 - 1821.72] your body and if it's working I started
[1819.86 - 1823.40] working for you of course and that I was
[1821.72 - 1825.05] like and whatever is working for you
[1823.40 - 1826.91] couldn't work for anybody that's how I
[1825.05 - 1829.49] saw and literally it was like wait a
[1826.91 - 1830.78] minute but that's the other thing some
[1829.49 - 1833.09] people you don't have the support system
[1830.78 - 1835.85] you don't have someone fighting for you
[1833.09 - 1838.19] or believing your symptoms or you know
[1835.85 - 1840.50] it's like just listen to your doctor you
[1838.19 - 1842.81] know and of course doctors are there for
[1840.50 - 1844.22] a course they're amazing and they're
[1842.81 - 1845.81] always you know important I don't want
[1844.22 - 1847.85] to say it's not going against but
[1845.81 - 1849.68] sometimes thinking outside of the box or
[1847.85 - 1852.08] trusting your body yeah
[1849.68 - 1854.48] Kent helps you can help because you can
[1852.08 - 1856.31] get bombarded with oh but this works for
[1854.48 - 1857.63] that person and this you know this is
[1856.31 - 1859.34] what my doctor says and this with the
[1857.63 - 1860.66] other doctor says and there's so much
[1859.34 - 1869.18] information but at the end of the day
[1860.66 - 1870.74] like kind of trusting yourself I think
[1869.18 - 1872.18] there are plenty of people that have
[1870.74 - 1876.32] gotten well with the help of a doctor
[1872.18 - 1879.47] and for me I I couldn't get organized
[1876.32 - 1881.93] around what they were telling me to do
[1879.47 - 1884.63] I really couldn't it was this was much
[1881.93 - 1887.63] more simple for me and it was manageable
[1884.63 - 1890.63] and it was it was like I always say to
[1887.63 - 1892.94] like it's medicine being in food being
[1890.63 - 1896.06] your medicine I remember in the very
[1892.94 - 1898.97] beginning you telling me I had struggled
[1896.06 - 1901.07] with Candida as well for a long time and
[1898.97 - 1907.52] my kind of healing journey and I was so
[1901.07 - 1908.96] scared of sugar and yeah you know fruits
[1907.52 - 1910.34] and you know I was like she was talking
[1908.96 - 1911.72] about the smoothing I was like I can't
[1910.34 - 1913.76] really do you know the blueberries and
[1911.72 - 1915.29] the thing that she was like no you need
[1913.76 - 1917.54] to read this book and like understand
[1915.29 - 1925.01] and it really made sense to me you know
[1917.54 - 1927.56] fruit is one nature and you almost have
[1925.01 - 1929.69] to you know go against maybe what what's
[1927.56 - 1931.91] trendy yes it's trendy to have less
[1929.69 - 1933.98] friendly blue berries people are so
[1931.91 - 1935.54] scared of you know bananas and this
[1933.98 - 1937.79] thing has like what two or three bananas
[1935.54 - 1939.68] in it I mean I had just yet three
[1937.79 - 1941.90] bananas a day every day for two years
[1939.68 - 1944.78] the reason my sugar was okay the reason
[1941.90 - 1946.88] why trends don't save anybody from real
[1944.78 - 1948.92] sickness is because they were originally
[1946.88 - 1951.23] propelled by financial gain their back
[1948.92 - 1952.88] their back my money and backed by even
[1951.23 - 1954.56] studies for a reason they're backed by
[1952.88 - 1956.30] things purposely and then put out to
[1954.56 - 1958.25] Bank and bankroll and make money okay
[1956.30 - 1960.53] fine but when you're sick and you're
[1958.25 - 1962.93] struggling and you're in your bed and
[1960.53 - 1964.73] you're you go to three line doctors you
[1962.93 - 1967.04] think you're gonna die and then the line
[1964.73 - 1969.77] groups aren't a lot of help sometimes in
[1967.04 - 1972.65] the old days to a story everybody's
[1969.77 - 1974.99] their own story but when you try to go
[1972.65 - 1977.27] against the trend in a line group what
[1974.99 - 1978.71] happens you know what happens there
[1977.27 - 1981.22] because you know I noticed that people
[1978.71 - 1983.84] what I mean I think I don't like I
[1981.22 - 1985.19] couldn't really share it I think I'd
[1983.84 - 1989.33] there were a couple people I did share
[1985.19 - 1990.95] it with in there yeah I mean there's
[1989.33 - 1993.53] people that don't get it and there's I
[1990.95 - 1995.21] mean it's so simple so how could this if
[1993.53 - 1997.76] you're really suffering how could celery
[1995.21 - 1999.80] juice help you how could you know we
[1997.76 - 2001.66] just we love to look outside for healing
[1999.80 - 2004.48] we like to go to experts and we like to
[2001.66 - 2006.55] you know oh this is the top top doctor
[2004.48 - 2008.28] and I'm I think that works for some
[2006.55 - 2011.95] people it just didn't work for me
[2008.28 - 2014.80] because it was it was too complicated
[2011.95 - 2016.84] and my body's really sensitive and you
[2014.80 - 2018.82] get since I got reactions from every
[2016.84 - 2021.25] system and you get when you get lime
[2018.82 - 2023.56] yeah thanks ultra sensitive and I would
[2021.25 - 2025.30] call me though nobody has ever had that
[2023.56 - 2026.80] reaction I've heard that so many times
[2025.30 - 2029.02] no one's ever had that reaction I mean I
[2026.80 - 2031.09] couldn't handle you know even food
[2029.02 - 2032.17] nevermind like you know a drug or
[2031.09 - 2034.54] something that was new that I was
[2032.17 - 2037.06] introducing so you have to know and what
[2034.54 - 2039.34] I liked about this was I could control
[2037.06 - 2041.20] it I could kick it up if I wanted a
[2039.34 - 2043.57] little more cleansing and detoxifying or
[2041.20 - 2045.31] I could pull it back and like the you
[2043.57 - 2048.13] know the killer stuff the stuff that
[2045.31 - 2050.98] kills like the you know cats call and
[2048.13 - 2053.32] the licorice root and lemon balm stuff
[2050.98 - 2056.62] like that I could kind of ease off that
[2053.32 - 2058.27] for a while and I would just you know do
[2056.62 - 2059.83] the supportive things like if I did
[2058.27 - 2061.93] nothing else I just took the support of
[2059.83 - 2064.30] supplements and food it's like how could
[2061.93 - 2066.76] but when it's the right things when it's
[2064.30 - 2068.95] the right things it all counts that
[2066.76 - 2070.33] when it really counts yeah when it's the
[2068.95 - 2072.01] right things that's what you were doing
[2070.33 - 2077.77] you were doing the licorice root and the
[2072.01 - 2080.14] cat's claw yeah because yeah because
[2077.77 - 2082.72] Lyme disease isn't isn't bacterial it's
[2080.14 - 2084.70] not bacterial that's the big mistake
[2082.72 - 2086.32] and that's what happens that's why the
[2084.70 - 2088.65] licorice and the cat's claw and all
[2086.32 - 2092.23] these work because those are antivirals
[2088.65 - 2095.05] and I really felt like I was viral like
[2092.23 - 2096.64] the night sweats you know and I think
[2095.05 - 2098.77] that everyone has their own brand of
[2096.64 - 2101.11] toxic soup and you know some people have
[2098.77 - 2104.19] more viral most people probably have
[2101.11 - 2106.51] more viral and some people have
[2104.19 - 2108.97] absolutely have bacteria bacteria
[2106.51 - 2110.95] doesn't cause neurological problems and
[2108.97 - 2112.96] that's yeah that's where science and
[2110.95 - 2115.03] research is either completely in the
[2112.96 - 2116.47] dark or can't help anybody out or they
[2115.03 - 2118.69] haven't done any of the work yet but
[2116.47 - 2120.79] that's that's a thing it's the viruses
[2118.69 - 2122.32] that create neurological Lyme so when
[2120.79 - 2124.69] you're diagnosed with stage-four
[2122.32 - 2128.05] neurological Lyme that's a really high
[2124.69 - 2130.21] viral load yeah that's if it is and
[2128.05 - 2133.06] that's the controversial point too that
[2130.21 - 2135.31] when I finally cracked the Lyme disease
[2133.06 - 2138.42] world and kind of broke it apart because
[2135.31 - 2141.13] it's shifting now thank God because
[2138.42 - 2142.96] because there doctors know now they're
[2141.13 - 2144.52] learning that it's viral because of this
[2142.96 - 2146.50] information so there they're back and
[2144.52 - 2149.71] down on antibiotics and they're trying
[2146.50 - 2151.21] to bring in cat's claw yeah but when my
[2149.71 - 2153.73] doctor said that actually one of my
[2151.21 - 2155.56] doctors said you know people have got I
[2153.73 - 2157.81] will say I don't know what's his name
[2155.56 - 2159.52] but one of my doctors in California had
[2157.81 - 2161.28] the book on his desk and I said we'll
[2159.52 - 2163.78] have you read it I would challenge him
[2161.28 - 2164.68] he's like no no how do you know what
[2163.78 - 2168.64] you're talking about you haven't read it
[2164.68 - 2170.08] and he said you know I saw him about six
[2168.64 - 2171.82] months after and he says because I would
[2170.08 - 2173.41] check in I had to check in and just make
[2171.82 - 2174.88] sure he talked but usually I felt like
[2173.41 - 2178.00] it was just sort of like a check-in like
[2174.88 - 2179.74] what are you are you seeing this and I
[2178.00 - 2182.38] would ask like I would ask simple
[2179.74 - 2185.26] questions like hey you're lying patients
[2182.38 - 2187.30] did they all have epstein-barr - or a
[2185.26 - 2189.61] past infection for epstein-barr and that
[2187.30 - 2193.48] he would say yes and I would say oh hey
[2189.61 - 2195.52] um you know have people taking cat's
[2193.48 - 2196.81] claw and gotten better and not taking
[2195.52 - 2200.38] care but you know I would like ask him
[2196.81 - 2200.59] he's like he told me at one point you
[2200.38 - 2203.59] can
[2200.59 - 2205.54] get better with just cats cloth and I
[2203.59 - 2208.18] was like why did you tell me that a year
[2205.54 - 2210.13] ago I was like you know are you reading
[2208.18 - 2211.51] the book or you just you don't and I
[2210.13 - 2212.95] thought that that was progress and
[2211.51 - 2216.22] pretty well a lot of doctors were
[2212.95 - 2219.22] reading the books but but not letting
[2216.22 - 2220.54] people know too because in the early
[2219.22 - 2222.16] days now there's lots of doctors that
[2220.54 - 2224.23] say yeah I have medical medium books in
[2222.16 - 2226.72] my practice because all the patients are
[2224.23 - 2229.60] coming in now across the world globally
[2226.72 - 2231.67] and in the u.s. especially and so what
[2229.60 - 2233.86] happens is they used to privately look
[2231.67 - 2236.62] at the books and lean from the
[2233.86 - 2238.12] information and you know and then they
[2236.62 - 2239.47] kind of you know they say well yeah
[2238.12 - 2241.81] cat's claw can help
[2239.47 - 2244.24] I mean I remember thirty years ago in my
[2241.81 - 2247.06] office literally my first office thirty
[2244.24 - 2248.59] years ago and I had a big jar of cat's
[2247.06 - 2250.36] claw drive because she couldn't get a
[2248.59 - 2252.55] good quality cats because I had to have
[2250.36 - 2254.29] the drive and I would just take it out
[2252.55 - 2255.73] when the spirit said take this out for
[2254.29 - 2257.17] the person I would say this is what you
[2255.73 - 2259.18] need to do for your Lyme disease and
[2257.17 - 2262.15] they got off the antibiotics and they
[2259.18 - 2265.57] took it in there you know well they
[2262.15 - 2268.24] would make it in a bag and this is what
[2265.57 - 2271.57] you have to do and and it's finally
[2268.24 - 2273.55] taking off now but but you know there's
[2271.57 - 2275.95] still there's a lot of problems we have
[2273.55 - 2277.90] in the line world one is you know the
[2275.95 - 2281.32] labs don't want to let go of bacteria
[2277.90 - 2283.75] because they just built an empire on it
[2281.32 - 2285.79] you got and then you got the antibiotic
[2283.75 - 2288.31] sales right Big Pharma they built an
[2285.79 - 2288.67] empire off antibiotics for lives Yeah
[2288.31 - 2290.23] right
[2288.67 - 2291.88] I mean hail if that's the right to do
[2290.23 - 2293.17] that's right to do it I'm not I'm not
[2291.88 - 2294.40] really cooling it I'm just saying if
[2293.17 - 2297.55] that's what you want to do but the
[2294.40 - 2299.89] problem is it's viral so we have but but
[2297.55 - 2302.47] it's falling apart now because the
[2299.89 - 2304.39] industry the medical industry actually
[2302.47 - 2305.77] took big pharma took Lyme disease and
[2304.39 - 2307.90] they moved it out of the bacteria
[2305.77 - 2310.51] category without telling anybody and
[2307.90 - 2312.64] they put it in autoimmune which means
[2310.51 - 2314.92] it's not bacterial now it's autoimmune
[2312.64 - 2316.54] but they did it in a sly way without
[2314.92 - 2318.55] informing too many people without
[2316.54 - 2320.29] informing too many doctors it's now
[2318.55 - 2323.05] moved it's now considered an autoimmune
[2320.29 - 2325.96] disease which means if it's autoimmune
[2323.05 - 2327.82] that means that big pharma or whoever
[2325.96 - 2330.79] the medical industry or science and
[2327.82 - 2333.22] research believes that Lyme disease is
[2330.79 - 2333.71] your body attacking itself no longer is
[2333.22 - 2335.99] it back
[2333.71 - 2337.76] Tyrael that's due to the medical medium
[2335.99 - 2339.68] books because millions of them got out
[2337.76 - 2341.84] their doctors are using them across the
[2339.68 - 2345.41] globe and they know that it's shifting
[2341.84 - 2347.78] whether anybody likes it or not saving
[2345.41 - 2348.95] lives but we still have the Lyme disease
[2347.78 - 2350.81] groups that are just all about
[2348.95 - 2352.76] herxheimer sand bacteria because there's
[2350.81 - 2354.86] a lot of old dogs that call them not the
[2352.76 - 2356.57] people but the old doctors that don't
[2354.86 - 2359.09] want to let go of that because they've
[2356.57 - 2360.50] been if you're proven wrong there's a
[2359.09 - 2363.32] lot of doctors that say you know what I
[2360.50 - 2364.19] was wrong yeah I was wrong I care about
[2363.32 - 2367.42] people too much
[2364.19 - 2370.25] I want them better darn it it's viral
[2367.42 - 2371.75] and it takes some time takes personal
[2370.25 - 2373.82] thing and then there's some doctors and
[2371.75 - 2376.01] I'm like I'm not admitting that that the
[2373.82 - 2377.81] 20 years I just bombarded people with
[2376.01 - 2379.70] antibiotics cuz science and research
[2377.81 - 2382.52] force them to force them to basically
[2379.70 - 2385.49] and and they don't want to break them
[2382.52 - 2387.20] and I understand I understand if you've
[2385.49 - 2390.35] been behind something your whole life
[2387.20 - 2392.27] you made it your life and then some guy
[2390.35 - 2396.14] that's not a doctor coating around the
[2392.27 - 2400.34] Titanic it's hard to you know but you
[2396.14 - 2402.05] know our message is I try to stay away
[2400.34 - 2404.63] from all that because it overwhelms me
[2402.05 - 2406.97] but my message is just listen to your
[2404.63 - 2410.21] body listen to your know this is really
[2406.97 - 2411.80] simple stuff I think when I was really
[2410.21 - 2414.56] suffering and really looking for answers
[2411.80 - 2417.80] I thought about like my plants and my
[2414.56 - 2419.87] dogs yeah and my child and just what are
[2417.80 - 2422.29] the things that a body needs to heal a
[2419.87 - 2425.90] body needs this fresh air sunshine
[2422.29 - 2428.72] adequate hydration and you turn
[2425.90 - 2431.75] nutrients nutrient-rich foods that it's
[2428.72 - 2433.61] kind of really basic and this is we're
[2431.75 - 2436.19] coming i hope full circle and empowering
[2433.61 - 2438.17] people to really listen to that and not
[2436.19 - 2440.51] be skeptical of it I think not too
[2438.17 - 2443.27] simple it's what I've ever meant to do
[2440.51 - 2445.49] and if you can find a healer or a doctor
[2443.27 - 2448.13] who's supportive who's open-minded all
[2445.49 - 2450.17] the better you know I would I would love
[2448.13 - 2451.40] to have found that and maybe maybe one
[2450.17 - 2452.78] of the doctors I was talking about who
[2451.40 - 2454.13] is open-minded maybe he's here now I
[2452.78 - 2455.93] haven't checked in and you know a year
[2454.13 - 2460.13] and a half two years because I don't you
[2455.93 - 2461.39] know feel good but I I do think yes of
[2460.13 - 2463.55] course there's agendas and stuff I
[2461.39 - 2467.49] really do think that everyone's just
[2463.55 - 2469.92] trying their best and that people
[2467.49 - 2472.50] to help people and and they're not able
[2469.92 - 2474.27] to really separate what's story and
[2472.50 - 2476.25] what's fact and what's fiction and it's
[2474.27 - 2478.62] just um well I'm it's just a murky
[2476.25 - 2480.30] environment and world for everyone I
[2478.62 - 2482.82] remember doctor telling me a member
[2480.30 - 2485.10] doctor friend telling me Anthony you
[2482.82 - 2487.50] know do you want to put this information
[2485.10 - 2489.42] out there about Lyme do you want that
[2487.50 - 2491.94] you know what I said I said what about
[2489.42 - 2495.81] the mommy that can't get out of bed to
[2491.94 - 2497.67] take her child to school and he said you
[2495.81 - 2499.86] know that you're going against the
[2497.67 - 2502.26] agenda that's out there you're going
[2499.86 - 2503.61] you're you're trying to crack it you
[2502.26 - 2507.21] know you're trying to you're going
[2503.61 - 2510.30] against all the rules and he said he
[2507.21 - 2511.41] said I've al you your fight he said you
[2510.30 - 2512.79] sure you want to do this because you
[2511.41 - 2515.40] don't have to do this and I said the
[2512.79 - 2516.90] mommy that can't make food she can't get
[2515.40 - 2519.63] up can make dinner and she has to rely
[2516.90 - 2521.46] on her husband or anything you know and
[2519.63 - 2523.71] then flee and and then and then the
[2521.46 - 2525.93] husband has to then change his whole
[2523.71 - 2528.06] life around and how he's working on his
[2525.93 - 2529.92] life parents move next door to us and
[2528.06 - 2535.59] helped us and he's he's losing sleep
[2529.92 - 2538.38] over how you feel what's going on yeah
[2535.59 - 2541.14] and my doctor friend said my friend said
[2538.38 - 2543.51] you know what I know I see it too I said
[2541.14 - 2545.67] you can't there's there's thousands and
[2543.51 - 2547.62] then hundreds of thousands of mom moms
[2545.67 - 2549.36] with the fatigue and the chronic fatigue
[2547.62 - 2551.10] and the buzzing and the ringing in the
[2549.36 - 2553.77] vertigo and dizziness and the high
[2551.10 - 2556.59] anxiety and they can't panic and this
[2553.77 - 2560.66] any aches and pains and then all their
[2556.59 - 2563.28] or rashes when they or the hot flash
[2560.66 - 2565.41] yeah and my doctor said it's this and
[2563.28 - 2567.39] your doctor says well you know
[2565.41 - 2570.33] experiencing the same things and that
[2567.39 - 2573.24] was what really the book really got me
[2570.33 - 2575.88] it's just oh there's all these different
[2573.24 - 2577.32] chapters with different like this
[2575.88 - 2578.91] collection of symptoms that's called
[2577.32 - 2580.98] this disease in this collection of
[2578.91 - 2583.14] symptoms and then you know talking to
[2580.98 - 2585.39] someone that had something else like ALS
[2583.14 - 2587.88] or aunt or MS or something that was
[2585.39 - 2590.10] similar to neurological line I was
[2587.88 - 2591.60] always like I wonder if it's the same I
[2590.10 - 2594.69] wonder if it's the same I wonder if it's
[2591.60 - 2596.55] a cousin of that you know and and I just
[2594.69 - 2597.69] was always asking those questions and
[2596.55 - 2599.73] you know that
[2597.69 - 2602.70] like controversial topic people are very
[2599.73 - 2604.29] attached to what their diagnosis is or
[2602.70 - 2607.71] what it's called or what their doctor
[2604.29 - 2610.83] said and I think that people I believe
[2607.71 - 2613.65] in you know the effect in a way and I
[2610.83 - 2617.94] believe that people need to do what they
[2613.65 - 2619.86] feel works for them and you know that's
[2617.94 - 2621.72] really really important to me but I
[2619.86 - 2623.31] don't think anyone can go wrong with
[2621.72 - 2625.20] more fruits and vegetables in their diet
[2623.31 - 2626.70] and when I was in nutrition school we
[2625.20 - 2629.61] learned something called crowding out
[2626.70 - 2631.38] and crowding out is just like bringing
[2629.61 - 2632.97] in the fruits bringing in the vegetables
[2631.38 - 2634.77] bringing in the herbal teas and stuff
[2632.97 - 2637.26] I'm just kind of crowding out the bad
[2634.77 - 2639.60] stuff and you know you're just naturally
[2637.26 - 2642.06] gonna you're naturally gonna eat a lot
[2639.60 - 2645.72] less like cheese chocolate beer and wine
[2642.06 - 2647.70] if you are you know I listen I hear I've
[2645.72 - 2649.41] listened to all your stuff so I hear in
[2647.70 - 2651.75] my head now it's like you know
[2649.41 - 2654.75] compassion is in your ear you're in my
[2651.75 - 2656.07] ear and it's literally like like well
[2654.75 - 2666.15] you can have one thought today but you
[2656.07 - 2681.69] would be better it's more like this you
[2666.15 - 2683.13] know just like annoying mosquito can you
[2681.69 - 2684.48] just steam a little asparagus on the
[2683.13 - 2686.55] side with dinner straight and so I
[2684.48 - 2688.05] always have that like how can I work it
[2686.55 - 2689.67] and how can I make it part of my life
[2688.05 - 2692.10] how can I bring it to my families of it
[2689.67 - 2693.51] they don't get sick and and you know to
[2692.10 - 2695.52] people that want to hear it you know
[2693.51 - 2698.46] it's the little things that we take for
[2695.52 - 2700.71] granted when were strong and we're
[2698.46 - 2704.04] feeling good it's every little thing
[2700.71 - 2707.97] it's not can I step out the front door
[2704.04 - 2711.15] and get to my little herb garden so I
[2707.97 - 2713.58] can maybe pluck some parsley that you
[2711.15 - 2715.68] know I couldn't even plant as my husband
[2713.58 - 2718.62] had to plant yes on or there's the
[2715.68 - 2720.99] little things can I can I actually you
[2718.62 - 2723.75] know take a shower yeah like how
[2720.99 - 2724.55] hardwood or showers enzymes like I got a
[2723.75 - 2727.07] lien around
[2724.55 - 2728.66] shots so any kind of hot water I
[2727.07 - 2730.85] couldn't breathe in the shower and I
[2728.66 - 2732.38] would feel like just like I was gonna
[2730.85 - 2734.69] pass out whenever he took a shower and
[2732.38 - 2737.42] I'd have to kind of like sit down or lay
[2734.69 - 2739.85] down I was really happy as laying down
[2737.42 - 2742.22] and I know that sounds crazy but just to
[2739.85 - 2744.92] get downstairs or to get dressed to hang
[2742.22 - 2747.08] out with my family was really hard and
[2744.92 - 2749.81] you know my daughter at the time was so
[2747.08 - 2751.37] so young that you know I think just it
[2749.81 - 2752.95] almost gave me more presents and
[2751.37 - 2755.21] attention to be with her in the house
[2752.95 - 2758.09] because I obviously couldn't work or
[2755.21 - 2760.07] anything but um you know she if she
[2758.09 - 2761.60] wanted to go and do something like I'm
[2760.07 - 2762.32] not going do something that she wanted
[2761.60 - 2767.21] to do this daddy
[2762.32 - 2770.54] it was my mother-in-law Sarah it was
[2767.21 - 2772.25] family or it was Nora the woman who
[2770.54 - 2774.62] brought in to help who is supposed to be
[2772.25 - 2777.05] like a babysitter for 15 hours a week
[2774.62 - 2779.03] ended up becoming like almost full time
[2777.05 - 2781.25] or full time at one point because the
[2779.03 - 2783.38] sicker I got the more I needed help and
[2781.25 - 2785.09] then you know not everyone has that
[2783.38 - 2787.34] luxury
[2785.09 - 2790.82] and you know I think if we had continued
[2787.34 - 2794.42] going the route that I was it would do
[2790.82 - 2797.69] it with every little thing counts when
[2794.42 - 2799.40] you're and then you're your and then you
[2797.69 - 2801.62] have to get into a mindset of I'm
[2799.40 - 2803.36] grateful I can shower today I'm grateful
[2801.62 - 2805.16] I can get downstairs and probably be on
[2803.36 - 2807.80] the couch for a little while and sit up
[2805.16 - 2809.78] yeah that's another thing too it's like
[2807.80 - 2813.59] how long can I sit up before I have to
[2809.78 - 2816.68] lay down that happens to a lot of people
[2813.59 - 2818.30] for like there were short hours of the
[2816.68 - 2819.59] day and then like I noticed as I was
[2818.30 - 2821.15] healing like it would get longer and
[2819.59 - 2823.88] longer and then I would like get up and
[2821.15 - 2826.31] out the healing to me was just like it
[2823.88 - 2828.26] would come I wasn't like oh I'm healed
[2826.31 - 2830.48] it was just one thing than one thing
[2828.26 - 2832.31] that I could do I could do more is it
[2830.48 - 2833.81] three steps up two steps back like I
[2832.31 - 2835.40] said on my pocket there's a roller
[2833.81 - 2837.20] coaster ride and I want to say that for
[2835.40 - 2838.88] people that are doing this right now and
[2837.20 - 2840.74] maybe you're in year one or two I don't
[2838.88 - 2842.33] know some some people you know it takes
[2840.74 - 2845.42] longer some people it takes shorter but
[2842.33 - 2847.10] just faithful just faithfully you know
[2845.42 - 2849.29] if you believe it and it resonates with
[2847.10 - 2851.27] you just faithfully do it because then
[2849.29 - 2852.53] you're just gonna get a shift and then
[2851.27 - 2854.18] you get another shift and then you're
[2852.53 - 2856.52] gonna have a step back but if you just
[2854.18 - 2857.41] keep getting back on just keep getting
[2856.52 - 2859.90] back on
[2857.41 - 2862.45] and believe it then that's when it
[2859.90 - 2864.97] really worked for me and I also think
[2862.45 - 2867.96] the emotional part of you know healing
[2864.97 - 2869.92] your emotional stuff is it's all
[2867.96 - 2871.57] mind/body/spirit so this is your body
[2869.92 - 2873.19] that you're healing but also your brain
[2871.57 - 2876.30] works better when you're eating clean
[2873.19 - 2879.88] and you're able to have more hope and
[2876.30 - 2889.03] you know just my spirit really when once
[2879.88 - 2890.05] I healed my broken spirit I think when
[2889.03 - 2892.36] you're when you're feeling good
[2890.05 - 2894.37] physically you can conquer anything
[2892.36 - 2897.13] emotionally when you're when the
[2894.37 - 2898.96] physical is down yeah that's when the
[2897.13 - 2901.12] emotional wounds are hard that's when
[2898.96 - 2903.43] everything is hard because you can't
[2901.12 - 2906.16] even distract yourself from you can't
[2903.43 - 2908.35] even do like I'm gonna go and take a jog
[2906.16 - 2910.03] I'm gonna go and take a run you know I'm
[2908.35 - 2912.70] gonna go and do this because you can
[2910.03 - 2915.28] distract yourself when you're feeling
[2912.70 - 2917.08] good to help battle emotional turmoil
[2915.28 - 2918.73] how many people go I'm gonna go and
[2917.08 - 2920.95] meditate I'm gonna go on a hill on a
[2918.73 - 2922.93] climb on a hike hike today with my
[2920.95 - 2924.67] girlfriend or my boyfriend and I'm gonna
[2922.93 - 2926.41] go for a hike because I'm battling some
[2924.67 - 2928.42] stuff emotionally I went to an emotional
[2926.41 - 2929.95] counselor this is not the Deacon when
[2928.42 - 2932.26] you're feeling good enough you can
[2929.95 - 2934.54] actually take action you can take action
[2932.26 - 2936.19] you can you can keep yourself busy you
[2934.54 - 2937.66] can distract yourself you can hop on a
[2936.19 - 2939.13] treadmill for a half an hour I have so
[2937.66 - 2940.69] many people that say you know I hop on a
[2939.13 - 2943.12] treadmill to burn off my steam and
[2940.69 - 2945.76] adjust me and balance me emotionally but
[2943.12 - 2948.01] when you get hit with that the viral
[2945.76 - 2951.31] issues and and you get hit and knocked
[2948.01 - 2953.65] down yeah and now you're just laying in
[2951.31 - 2956.77] a bed I tell people hang in there
[2953.65 - 2959.62] there's a way there's a way up there's a
[2956.77 - 2961.93] way up to heal there's a way out of the
[2959.62 - 2963.85] bed and there's a way to getting back to
[2961.93 - 2965.29] doing things you love again whatever
[2963.85 - 2967.45] that might be it could be the smallest
[2965.29 - 2970.39] things like taking a little walk on the
[2967.45 - 2972.64] street yeah I mean anything oh yeah I
[2970.39 - 2974.32] mean it was eating like yes that I
[2972.64 - 2980.02] couldn't eat for so long I mean it's
[2974.32 - 2981.79] that simple sometimes it's heavy but and
[2980.02 - 2983.74] then it becomes social like you never
[2981.79 - 2986.87] partake is something with people that
[2983.74 - 2990.50] you couldn't do or you know
[2986.87 - 2992.81] I'm not nothing but well conversing so
[2990.50 - 2994.61] you're in a social environment you get
[2992.81 - 2997.73] together with some friends or even
[2994.61 - 3006.55] family and you can't socialize the way
[2997.73 - 3008.29] you want to work stressors I would just
[3006.55 - 3009.85] whelmed with the challah just the
[3008.29 - 3011.38] holidays like I wanted to be there for
[3009.85 - 3013.27] my family I wanted to cook and have
[3011.38 - 3014.35] people and I would just be like I can't
[3013.27 - 3016.96] handle this I have to be in my room
[3014.35 - 3018.85] because my nervous system was collapsed
[3016.96 - 3020.68] and that's around family you know we're
[3018.85 - 3022.33] more comfortable when we're at war when
[3020.68 - 3023.86] we're around family well what about
[3022.33 - 3026.28] friends you haven't seen in a while it
[3023.86 - 3029.41] could be really difficult because now
[3026.28 - 3031.20] you want more work I mean forget working
[3029.41 - 3034.72] it and it takes it to a new level of
[3031.20 - 3036.34] being hard on the nervous system these
[3034.72 - 3038.38] are all things people are going through
[3036.34 - 3041.14] with their lime and going through with
[3038.38 - 3049.98] their different symptoms and you you you
[3041.14 - 3049.98] push through this I know and you know
[3051.66 - 3055.57] you got more energy than I do today so
[3054.13 - 3057.79] I'm trying to finish up a book
[3055.57 - 3060.58] yeah and I'm killing myself on every
[3057.79 - 3063.22] chance I can you got more energy than I
[3060.58 - 3066.67] do right now you're like you're popping
[3063.22 - 3068.56] with energy no I mean am I am I just
[3066.67 - 3071.08] making that up but she's got the energy
[3068.56 - 3072.94] seeing as the friend it was like first
[3071.08 - 3075.25] of all it was just it was a heavy time
[3072.94 - 3076.48] it was dark and it was scary and like we
[3075.25 - 3077.68] know we talked about the fear but it's
[3076.48 - 3078.49] that fear of the unknown what's
[3077.68 - 3080.85] happening to me
[3078.49 - 3083.65] no one really knows what does this mean
[3080.85 - 3085.09] how am I gonna get better and then it
[3083.65 - 3086.56] was like this little tiny light at the
[3085.09 - 3089.38] end of the tunnel and this process and
[3086.56 - 3091.24] the belief and seeing the shifts and
[3089.38 - 3093.67] then literally just you know over time
[3091.24 - 3096.61] there was one day I came to the house
[3093.67 - 3099.43] and I said I was like you're back like
[3096.61 - 3102.64] it was just a vibrancy and it was a
[3099.43 - 3105.19] lightness and you know and and she's
[3102.64 - 3107.68] literally supermom she's literally the
[3105.19 - 3109.87] greatest mom in the whole world and but
[3107.68 - 3110.38] you see if you see her energy and her
[3109.87 - 3114.63] pouch
[3110.38 - 3114.63] and she doesn't want to miss a minute
[3114.72 - 3118.96] that's the gift if anyone who has
[3116.98 - 3120.79] chronic illness or anyone that's spent
[3118.96 - 3121.99] time down whether you're in bed or you
[3120.79 - 3124.27] know some of the times I was in bed
[3121.99 - 3126.85] sometimes I was just at home on my couch
[3124.27 - 3128.53] pajamas like wanting to get dressed and
[3126.85 - 3130.84] like you know wanting to get out and
[3128.53 - 3131.92] like participate in life but it's hard
[3130.84 - 3134.17] on the kids
[3131.92 - 3136.03] it's hard on - you're wondering if it's
[3134.17 - 3138.10] affecting your children you wonder if
[3136.03 - 3139.93] it's a way to take care of your child
[3138.10 - 3142.39] but you you have to take care of
[3139.93 - 3144.70] yourself and you know that's I think for
[3142.39 - 3146.44] mommies it's the hardest thing because
[3144.70 - 3147.07] you are still even if you have somebody
[3146.44 - 3149.41] helping you
[3147.07 - 3151.99] you're still consumed with your child
[3149.41 - 3154.00] least I was just annoyingly there all
[3151.99 - 3156.01] the time and like unable to let someone
[3154.00 - 3158.26] really do it as much as I you know
[3156.01 - 3160.30] should've probably but you can hardly
[3158.26 - 3163.33] you can't listen to what you need when
[3160.30 - 3166.93] you have a crying baby a or a colicky
[3163.33 - 3168.91] baby which I had and you're exhausted
[3166.93 - 3170.68] it's just very hard it's hard you know
[3168.91 - 3172.00] in my practice even before this like
[3170.68 - 3174.64] mommy's feeding themselves like a
[3172.00 - 3177.43] nutritious lunch even you know instead
[3174.64 - 3179.11] of like eating like a sugary bar and
[3177.43 - 3181.65] going off to do a million things for
[3179.11 - 3184.93] their kids work we're a service to our
[3181.65 - 3186.49] children that is what the mothers are
[3184.93 - 3190.30] absurdist to their children and their
[3186.49 - 3193.44] homes and their husbands and and so when
[3190.30 - 3195.64] you're sick and you can't provide that
[3193.44 - 3198.73] environment and value levels and that
[3195.64 - 3202.48] basic nurturing that you want to it is
[3198.73 - 3205.54] very very tough on everybody everyone
[3202.48 - 3208.38] your spouse your kids everybody so so
[3205.54 - 3210.91] the gifts of having chronic illness are
[3208.38 - 3212.89] if you've spent time down then when
[3210.91 - 3214.06] you're it's the motivation of I want to
[3212.89 - 3215.50] get out I want to do this and this and
[3214.06 - 3217.93] then once you're feeling better you're
[3215.50 - 3220.48] like I'm gonna do everything it gives
[3217.93 - 3222.16] you like this new zest for life like I'm
[3220.48 - 3224.44] planning on these trips right now and
[3222.16 - 3228.28] I'm super excited and I go to concerts
[3224.44 - 3230.74] now and I I you know I've taken so many
[3228.28 - 3232.81] road trips since I got well I'm dragging
[3230.74 - 3235.00] my family and you succeed you'll think
[3232.81 - 3236.58] about it now like I'm on a road trip I
[3235.00 - 3241.23] could couldn't have done a road trip
[3236.58 - 3241.23] back a few years ago yours ain't easy
[3241.77 - 3244.86] [Music]
[3248.75 - 3253.85] this reminds me a point - can you just
[3251.36 - 3256.85] let everybody know that because I don't
[3253.85 - 3258.65] see anybody anymore okay you know on
[3256.85 - 3259.73] that level and I can't because I'm
[3258.65 - 3261.71] writing the books and everything like
[3259.73 - 3263.51] that that the informations in these
[3261.71 - 3265.94] books right it's there and all
[3263.51 - 3267.74] everything else because it because of
[3265.94 - 3269.24] how to stop helping up people because
[3267.74 - 3271.58] the waiting list was in the millions so
[3269.24 - 3273.68] I had to put it in the books years ago
[3271.58 - 3280.88] it's you weren't probably the last yes
[3273.68 - 3282.17] and I spoke to yes I applied to win the
[3280.88 - 3284.00] lottery and I had this like weird
[3282.17 - 3288.08] feeling I was gonna win which I never
[3284.00 - 3292.82] have because I lose but I I did actually
[3288.08 - 3295.19] win and it was February of 2016 and I
[3292.82 - 3297.14] was one of the last people it was that
[3295.19 - 3299.30] was pretty much wouldn't stop it's not
[3297.14 - 3300.95] this right I had to keep up with the
[3299.30 - 3306.95] books and get the information to the
[3300.95 - 3310.25] world there were there were hundreds of
[3306.95 - 3313.76] thousands of mommy's in the waiting list
[3310.25 - 3316.31] and hundreds of thousands of children
[3313.76 - 3318.26] win the waiting list and it was it was
[3316.31 - 3320.63] breaking my heart and there I had to do
[3318.26 - 3322.82] books cuz I knew there was no way I can
[3320.63 - 3329.08] do it alone and get to everybody yeah it
[3322.82 - 3329.08] wouldn't happen and so it was a mere
[3331.72 - 3336.98] this has the supplements this has the
[3334.67 - 3339.77] supplements in the book but it doesn't
[3336.98 - 3341.66] have what I always call your yogi and I
[3339.77 - 3344.47] would do like two drops and think that
[3341.66 - 3344.47] was gonna get me well
[3351.47 - 3357.02] out the handed ends and it has over 200
[3355.52 - 3377.30] different symptoms and conditions and
[3357.02 - 3379.25] the dosages right so what you you know
[3377.30 - 3389.66] theme I say through all of them is the
[3379.25 - 3391.61] same heavy metals because what people
[3389.66 - 3394.37] need to know is the viruses feed off the
[3391.61 - 3401.60] heavy metals and and yeah all you need
[3394.37 - 3403.61] is a trigger an emotional hardship you
[3401.60 - 3405.35] can really I mean that's also one thing
[3403.61 - 3406.94] I want to say if I won the lottery I got
[3405.35 - 3408.56] to consult with them I he was supposed
[3406.94 - 3418.97] to only give me 30 minutes he gave me 60
[3408.56 - 3421.46] minutes I did and I never talk to him
[3418.97 - 3425.90] again after I just had the books and I
[3421.46 - 3430.94] had the internet and I just would listen
[3425.90 - 3432.85] to the and I just would take notes and
[3430.94 - 3435.74] then I think what happens is I had zero
[3432.85 - 3439.03] intuition about what was good I can help
[3435.74 - 3439.03] everyone else to oh I doubt that
[3440.23 - 3449.15] no you know even in my practice like I
[3447.14 - 3450.35] knew how to help everyone but I just put
[3449.15 - 3454.30] my self-care on the bar you mean
[3450.35 - 3454.30] intuition on yourself yeah self-care
[3457.54 - 3463.19] eating like I mean there were years
[3461.18 - 3465.14] where it was like frosting for breakfast
[3463.19 - 3475.52] I mean my friends can say that's right
[3465.14 - 3479.83] like old places where all you can do is
[3475.52 - 3479.83] like drink in a basement basically yeah
[3482.50 - 3494.90] in a basement with pizza so so no I
[3492.41 - 3497.12] didn't have a lot of like it was shut
[3494.90 - 3498.98] down it was disconnected so as I was
[3497.12 - 3500.72] doing it and I couldn't talk to you I
[3498.98 - 3501.80] had those you know three years this is
[3500.72 - 3504.68] the first time I talked to you since
[3501.80 - 3506.78] then so I kind of got better at being
[3504.68 - 3508.37] like ah what do I need today or what you
[3506.78 - 3512.75] know I would go with the basic protocol
[3508.37 - 3514.46] but I would feel it out and go like
[3512.75 - 3516.23] highlighted and I go back and it read
[3514.46 - 3527.93] chapters and I get so you did the
[3516.23 - 3545.27] highlighting oh yeah listen because when
[3527.93 - 3556.25] you find something that works there and
[3545.27 - 3559.58] he's watching like CNN or something with
[3556.25 - 3561.83] your intestinal stuff and I was said
[3559.58 - 3564.89] earlier how that could like take over a
[3561.83 - 3568.13] person's life and it becomes I mean the
[3564.89 - 3578.63] bloating the gas France yeah the just
[3568.13 - 3581.84] going to bathroom bathroom is like you
[3578.63 - 3583.55] and like where it even can give you like
[3581.84 - 3585.47] aches and pains when I get so bad
[3583.55 - 3586.85] because you're getting you get the look
[3585.47 - 3588.29] great do you get the low-grade viral
[3586.85 - 3590.17] stuff to know if there you get the aches
[3588.29 - 3592.36] and pains a little bit
[3590.17 - 3594.73] hands all the time everybody that knows
[3592.36 - 3600.34] me surprising that I can actually be
[3594.73 - 3602.44] facing you guys you know because they
[3600.34 - 3604.99] remember being at Kate's house yeah with
[3602.44 - 3615.97] you guys and and and we took a little
[3604.99 - 3617.50] look and everything you know I don't
[3615.97 - 3619.84] want you guys to think that I'm out
[3617.50 - 3621.58] there doing readings now think they said
[3619.84 - 3624.66] you're not leaving yes
[3621.58 - 3627.79] you're not leaving Kate's house and they
[3624.66 - 3629.65] yeah and they said this and I and no but
[3627.79 - 3632.77] that's but it really was incredible
[3629.65 - 3634.75] because there was you know the reading
[3632.77 - 3637.45] came out and it was just stuff that no
[3634.75 - 3639.28] one knows about anybody and you know
[3637.45 - 3641.47] Oliver was job was on the floor and he
[3639.28 - 3644.50] was like what I was this how's this
[3641.47 - 3646.60] possible and and it just but first of
[3644.50 - 3650.86] all it made sense and and to me I was
[3646.60 - 3653.38] like you know this is stuff that for
[3650.86 - 3665.05] years I mean you talk about your ear and
[3653.38 - 3666.94] hearing yelling he was like oh I was
[3665.05 - 3674.86] turning around saying huh what happened
[3666.94 - 3682.17] I thought yeah so it was incredible I
[3674.86 - 3684.70] felt like or question to anything it was
[3682.17 - 3687.34] yeah and it's really the end no matter
[3684.70 - 3689.56] what your ailments are I feel like
[3687.34 - 3691.12] there's something in ya look back I
[3689.56 - 3693.79] don't want anybody thinking just because
[3691.12 - 3701.08] they can't have that chance exactly that
[3693.79 - 3704.62] they can't get the information and I had
[3701.08 - 3706.87] my complete experience literally come
[3704.62 - 3708.70] just you know watching her heal reading
[3706.87 - 3711.73] connecting to it saying oh my gosh this
[3708.70 - 3713.88] is a it makes so much sense and be it's
[3711.73 - 3716.56] the first thing that worked that really
[3713.88 - 3717.82] worked and I committed to it just as
[3716.56 - 3720.16] hard as I committed to any other
[3717.82 - 3721.93] protocol that I was told in the past or
[3720.16 - 3725.41] antibiotics which caused other problems
[3721.93 - 3727.09] and this you know was a game-changer but
[3725.41 - 3730.21] then and then I got to meet you so it's
[3727.09 - 3732.28] the added bonus on top for me and you
[3730.21 - 3735.97] know just being able to say thank you
[3732.28 - 3748.69] and and just in hear your story - that
[3735.97 - 3750.34] was cool I hope you guys you know when

[3794.98 - 3799.63] single person happy but you're changing
[3796.18 - 3810.93] people's lives and you know I know
[3799.63 - 3810.93] exactly where I would be and it was so
[3818.01 - 3821.56] 25th
[3819.22 - 3823.63] I threw a birthday brunch for myself in
[3821.56 - 3825.61] my garden and in my back like you know
[3823.63 - 3827.74] we'll call it garden it's patio and and
[3825.61 - 3832.65] I had all my girlfriend's there and had
[3827.74 - 3832.65] so much energy to like make the food
[3842.28 - 3846.31] days later
[3843.85 - 3847.96] I had like this that's what gave me the
[3846.31 - 3852.52] glimpse of hopes I was like well I feel
[3847.96 - 3854.92] amazing and I don't know why you
[3852.52 - 3857.05] working but it's working you know spirit
[3854.92 - 3858.34] of compassion told me when I was when I
[3857.05 - 3859.78] was younger and spirit of compassion
[3858.34 - 3862.12] told me there
[3859.78 - 3863.35] this information is going to empower
[3862.12 - 3865.81] people I didn't know what that word
[3863.35 - 3868.90] meant okay because I'm not people think
[3865.81 - 3870.22] I mean I hear a voice perfectly clear it
[3868.90 - 3873.10] gives me this advanced medical
[3870.22 - 3876.25] information to save lives but it doesn't
[3873.10 - 3878.65] mean I practice the most spiritual or or
[3876.25 - 3879.31] talked the most spiritual or anything
[3878.65 - 3881.56] like that
[3879.31 - 3883.93] and I remember once when spirit told me
[3881.56 - 3887.05] this is going to empower women moms
[3883.93 - 3888.40] women and everything men too and I
[3887.05 - 3889.96] didn't know what it meant I was like
[3888.40 - 3891.82] what does empowerment mean what does
[3889.96 - 3893.98] empower mean and then I heard it
[3891.82 - 3896.44] throughout the years but what it meant
[3893.98 - 3898.39] was you know when you're in the depths
[3896.44 - 3900.52] of despair like that and there's no
[3898.39 - 3902.05] answers and you can't even have that
[3900.52 - 3903.82] brunch you can't even have that brunch
[3902.05 - 3906.28] with family or friends or anything and
[3903.82 - 3908.23] you can't even even do anything but then
[3906.28 - 3910.27] you can take control over your life and
[3908.23 - 3911.86] you can actually I'm getting choked up
[3910.27 - 3912.40] and you can actually do something about
[3911.86 - 3914.62] it
[3912.40 - 3917.29] that's real empowerment now that that's
[3914.62 - 3919.18] empowerment and that's what spirit was
[3917.29 - 3921.49] teaching me like that's what this is
[3919.18 - 3923.71] gonna be is gonna be empowerment for
[3921.49 - 3926.74] women to be able to just to not be
[3923.71 - 3930.13] bullied and spiritually bullied by the
[3926.74 - 3932.17] industry by trends in the industry and
[3930.13 - 3933.61] somebody might say well celery juice is
[3932.17 - 3935.02] a trend Anthony actually it was never
[3933.61 - 3936.67] backed or there was no agenda
[3935.02 - 3938.77] besides healing and it wasn't backed by
[3936.67 - 3940.66] any funding wasn't back for any science
[3938.77 - 3942.82] and research science resources even know
[3940.66 - 3944.56] anything about snow and you know and
[3942.82 - 3946.12] it's funny it's like how many millions
[3944.56 - 3947.53] to sell you just have to heal before
[3946.12 - 3949.90] science research so like there's no
[3947.53 - 3953.38] starting behind it's not good for you oh
[3949.90 - 3955.87] come on Howard right you were in Howard
[3953.38 - 3957.85] Howard and it was so full circle for me
[3955.87 - 3959.32] and you know somebody said to me once
[3957.85 - 3961.42] like I don't know if this was in school
[3959.32 - 3964.21] or work but if you want to know what to
[3961.42 - 3966.46] eat like any food that's ever been
[3964.21 - 3968.71] advertised is probably something you're
[3966.46 - 3971.41] not supposed to eat and all the foods
[3968.71 - 3974.23] that nobody talks about that nobody like
[3971.41 - 3976.21] you know advertises about those are the
[3974.23 - 3977.50] foods those are the foods we should be
[3976.21 - 3979.54] looking at and you're the first person
[3977.50 - 3981.97] like I don't know how you made celery
[3979.54 - 3983.38] trendy I don't know how you made like oh
[3981.97 - 3985.81] you know I've become a
[3983.38 - 3987.46] lover of vegetables wears before you
[3985.81 - 3988.96] know I said she used to talk that beer
[3987.46 - 3992.71] and wine where my four food groups
[3988.96 - 3995.68] and I you know it's just it's wonderful
[3992.71 - 3998.23] to feel to have this much energy and it
[3995.68 - 3999.70] comes from the plans it comes from the
[3998.23 - 4001.44] Sun that comes from the plants and then
[3999.70 - 4003.48] it comes into you and you know it's a
[4001.44 - 4005.37] live food from the earth it's one
[4003.48 - 4007.98] ingredient whole businesses of movement
[4005.37 - 4010.05] of Whole Foods it's back to basics it's
[4007.98 - 4015.08] stuff that my grandmother ate you know
[4010.05 - 4042.11] maybe she wasn't but you know my mom and
[4015.08 - 4044.31] they were picking wild blueberries ya
[4042.11 - 4045.54] know I mean I do think that there was
[4044.31 - 4047.40] this connection with nature I mean
[4045.54 - 4048.96] growing up in New England that we felt
[4047.40 - 4050.85] with the seasons and we picked apples
[4048.96 - 4054.60] and stuff like that I mean maybe that's
[4050.85 - 4056.31] not too far no no you're picking out you
[4054.60 - 4058.02] know what's funny you know it's funny
[4056.31 - 4061.98] that elevated biotics that i talked
[4058.02 - 4063.84] about in the communal that you know is
[4061.98 - 4066.69] more advanced than it more advanced in
[4063.84 - 4069.21] any way way more advanced and microbiome
[4066.69 - 4070.86] talk even today microbiome talk is just
[4069.21 - 4072.21] a new trendy word for they don't know
[4070.86 - 4082.53] what's wrong with your guts though and
[4072.21 - 4083.97] you know what spirits are talking to me
[4082.53 - 4088.26] as a child spirit said look we're
[4083.97 - 4090.36] picking you I said it on the pot because
[4088.26 - 4093.48] you can probably handle it and you're a
[4090.36 - 4095.28] fighter and no one even knows what I've
[4093.48 - 4098.07] gone through through this journey but
[4095.28 - 4101.36] but the point is those those ramps and
[4098.07 - 4101.36] everything you're like okay no
[4104.35 - 4108.68] I'm just trying to talk to the person
[4106.70 - 4115.76] that I was supposed to get to the
[4108.68 - 4131.06] information I get in my own way listen I
[4115.76 - 4132.62] do get in my own way I know I get fired
[4131.06 - 4133.64] up because you know when people suffer
[4132.62 - 4135.14] it's no joke
[4133.64 - 4136.85] that's the whole thing and people who
[4135.14 - 4138.95] hasn't some people who haven't suffered
[4136.85 - 4141.64] yet or been there they don't know what
[4138.95 - 4145.01] it's like for the other person and
[4141.64 - 4147.86] that's my issue that's my issue not to
[4145.01 - 4164.86] the people that don't know my issue is
[4147.86 - 4164.86] to the people out there enough to be
[4176.02 - 4180.92] funny thing is is if you know the
[4179.15 - 4182.66] industry is saying don't drink celery
[4180.92 - 4184.28] juice you need to have all your fiber
[4182.66 - 4185.78] don't juice it all these things they
[4184.28 - 4188.27] tell people wrong information but what's
[4185.78 - 4189.53] funny is okay you know what no one drink
[4188.27 - 4192.02] it anymore I just want it for myself
[4189.53 - 4203.60] because I it was it wasn't in the store
[4192.02 - 4205.25] one time I had some the funny thing is I
[4203.60 - 4207.41] can't go into the store anymore because
[4205.25 - 4209.51] I'll be mom bar decor so I can't go in
[4207.41 - 4211.64] there and water a celery juice right so
[4209.51 - 4214.13] someone has to go and get the celery for
[4211.64 - 4217.81] me I'm like hey aw I'm like what there's
[4214.13 - 4220.61] no celery and like no I need my celery
[4217.81 - 4222.26] and so so now that I hear it when you
[4220.61 - 4223.31] hear an article say Oh celery juice
[4222.26 - 4225.77] there's no science research I believe
[4223.31 - 4228.29] good good keep the negative did you know
[4225.77 - 4231.28] what I'm like I need my cell you know my
[4228.29 - 4231.28] heart of hearts I wanted
[4231.72 - 4236.32] it's one of these things were I feel
[4234.82 - 4240.79] like a lot of people say oh celery juice
[4236.32 - 4242.71] but it's sorry there's so much behind it
[4240.79 - 4245.89] even though it's one of these terms
[4242.71 - 4248.32] it's like seems simple yeah
[4245.89 - 4254.23] the information in the books is what
[4248.32 - 4262.96] really makes sense and the you know the
[4254.23 - 4268.27] I wanna say the the breaking the making
[4262.96 - 4269.83] sense kind of in your body yeah you know
[4268.27 - 4272.02] you have to top off the fluency your car
[4269.83 - 4288.58] you you know you get low on fluids you
[4272.02 - 4292.12] get low on you know I'm not so the zero
[4288.58 - 4297.70] diagnosis is just an idea theory that is
[4292.12 - 4299.41] bacteria that's what the theory is okay
[4297.70 - 4302.29] so the difference or what I discovered
[4299.41 - 4305.88] along the way was a lot of kind of GI
[4302.29 - 4308.62] issues are in the lower intestine and
[4305.88 - 4309.55] you know it's just a different diagnosis
[4308.62 - 4310.03] and there it's kind of two different
[4309.55 - 4311.86] things
[4310.03 - 4316.36] talent it was first and it's kind of
[4311.86 - 4319.09] where the food lands we sit down it used
[4316.36 - 4321.07] to be the Candida theory yeah and I took
[4319.09 - 4325.57] a long time I mean I worked hard to
[4321.07 - 4327.73] break that one yeah yeah I had to
[4325.57 - 4330.10] actually split that world in half laughs
[4327.73 - 4331.78] clearly cracking maligne world I had a I
[4330.10 - 4333.90] had a you know the information of the
[4331.78 - 4336.76] misinformation I mean just like the
[4333.90 - 4339.01] candida right crack that whole thing
[4336.76 - 4340.12] open because Candida you first of all if
[4339.01 - 4342.22] you're trying to get rid of your Candida
[4340.12 - 4343.99] that's how we actually absorb our
[4342.22 - 4349.15] nutrients we have to have Candida to do
[4343.99 - 4353.52] this so that was a theory because that
[4349.15 - 4353.52] is my hard work well spirits hard work
[4356.30 - 4362.66] yes but now they moved it they moved it
[4359.69 - 4364.31] to see Bo yeah okay and but the problem
[4362.66 - 4366.41] is with that one they don't know what
[4364.31 - 4368.33] bacteria it is that's behind anything
[4366.41 - 4370.22] and it's streptococcus that's what it is
[4368.33 - 4372.86] and it's caused from your liver being
[4370.22 - 4375.20] stagnant sluggish low bio reserves and
[4372.86 - 4375.47] low hydrochloric acid but here's the
[4375.20 - 4377.45] thing
[4375.47 - 4380.09] and then strep we all have strep in us
[4377.45 - 4382.25] and then it becomes a gut issue is what
[4380.09 - 4383.72] it does now they're trying to shift it
[4382.25 - 4385.22] all to this microbiome thing like
[4383.72 - 4387.50] everybody's like oh there's something in
[4385.22 - 4391.31] there that special they're still behind
[4387.50 - 4393.86] by 2030 years it's it's the elevated
[4391.31 - 4401.24] bionics that you know about right did
[4393.86 - 4403.88] you hear that I'm not friends with any
[4401.24 - 4405.83] farmers and I don't have okay so okay
[4403.88 - 4407.66] are you able to tell people I know it's
[4405.83 - 4409.88] in the boat or the countertop but like
[4407.66 - 4412.16] the basics of like if you want the
[4409.88 - 4414.32] elevated wrote your own parsley in a pot
[4412.16 - 4417.50] in a plant where in your kitchen if you
[4414.32 - 4419.48] need to yeah absolutely if you have to
[4417.50 - 4426.83] so you literally just buy like organic
[4419.48 - 4428.36] seeds seeds and gigantic soil grows when
[4426.83 - 4430.31] you pick that piece of parsley
[4428.36 - 4432.05] it's got bacteria on it it's got
[4430.31 - 4433.94] microorganism on it and those those are
[4432.05 - 4435.89] the I don't wash it leave it that you
[4433.94 - 4437.57] don't have to it's growing in your own
[4435.89 - 4439.37] it's not like you're using some
[4437.57 - 4448.84] dangerous this or that or yeah I'm using
[4439.37 - 4452.27] some kind of whatever it's true and so
[4448.84 - 4454.73] so what happens is that that parsley
[4452.27 - 4457.01] just is an example it has the elevated
[4454.73 - 4458.93] biotics and on it which science research
[4457.01 - 4460.25] doesn't know about either there's not
[4458.93 - 4463.19] only signs in research but all the
[4460.25 - 4465.53] probiotic companies that that's not what
[4463.19 - 4466.73] that is that just dies in your system
[4465.53 - 4468.74] you take all those probiotics it just
[4466.73 - 4471.41] gets eaten off your stomach acid it just
[4468.74 - 4475.19] kills it leaves that never even gets
[4471.41 - 4477.71] down there because it's not really no
[4475.19 - 4480.74] not in an item probiotic land but not
[4477.71 - 4482.48] even in earth you know earth soil borne
[4480.74 - 4482.72] work Michael Rehm ISM probiotic none of
[4482.48 - 4484.43] that
[4482.72 - 4488.23] it's the probe it's the it's the
[4484.43 - 4488.23] elevated biotic sorry not the end
[4492.84 - 4498.06] and it's that it's that microorganism
[4496.23 - 4499.59] that someday they'll study about it
[4498.06 - 4510.63] because we'll get them to do it and
[4499.59 - 4512.88] hopefully this is good well that's that
[4510.63 - 4514.80] goes into your gut but deep in it in the
[4512.88 - 4517.44] ileum and that's where you produce your
[4514.80 - 4519.33] b12 everybody's b12 deficient that's why
[4517.44 - 4521.37] I want people are like hey eww why
[4519.33 - 4523.20] you're pushing the b12 pushing the b12
[4521.37 - 4525.63] because no one has those elevated
[4523.20 - 4527.76] biotics yeah if you sprout your own
[4525.63 - 4529.68] sprouts if you like get a sprouting tray
[4527.76 - 4531.51] and you sprout your own sprouts you'll
[4529.68 - 4534.06] get the elevated biotic it will just
[4531.51 - 4536.25] literally be on the leaves it's coming
[4534.06 - 4539.70] from the Sun it's coming it's coming
[4536.25 - 4542.97] from the air the air literally it's like
[4539.70 - 4545.22] the it's like the Earth's ability to
[4542.97 - 4547.14] keep us healthy that we haven't even
[4545.22 - 4549.90] tapped into just like we haven't tapped
[4547.14 - 4551.55] into the Sun well what the Sun does for
[4549.90 - 4554.22] us we still don't even know we talking
[4551.55 - 4556.32] about Megane it's it's yeah there's so
[4554.22 - 4557.94] much more than that and so that's what's
[4556.32 - 4560.04] happening with the elevator biotics it's
[4557.94 - 4561.63] it's actually in the air and it develops
[4560.04 - 4563.94] literally develops there's some
[4561.63 - 4565.77] connection happening around us that
[4563.94 - 4568.65] creates that micro organism especially
[4565.77 - 4570.33] in the garden especially outside so if
[4568.65 - 4572.19] you open your kitchen door
[4570.33 - 4574.53] I just in Japan you open your kitchen
[4572.19 - 4585.93] door you're letting in outside air and
[4574.53 - 4596.61] it's in the outside air you know if you
[4585.93 - 4598.44] plant an apple tree on your property if
[4596.61 - 4600.33] you if you have a lemon tree and we
[4598.44 - 4602.13] rinse it am I supposed to not if it's
[4600.33 - 4612.39] off your own tree you don't rinse it
[4602.13 - 4614.82] like okay dirt and you can do a really
[4612.39 - 4617.86] laughs you can you can get a light rinse
[4614.82 - 4620.11] if you if you have you will anything
[4617.86 - 4622.03] you if it has if you know it hasn't been
[4620.11 - 4637.84] sprayed by pesticides right let's say
[4622.03 - 4640.81] that it was a fresh squirrel pee pee and
[4637.84 - 4649.95] that's what will happen but we are very
[4640.81 - 4652.87] disconnected from nature you know
[4649.95 - 4656.35] sterilized place with a wrapper well
[4652.87 - 4658.03] that squirrel pee has less anything in
[4656.35 - 4661.36] it then all the people walking around
[4658.03 - 4663.88] with all the shingles in hhv-6 is HB h7
[4661.36 - 4666.73] simplex is this that epstein-barr 64 I
[4663.88 - 4669.04] do have smart shingles that's hiria 50
[4666.73 - 4673.06] groups of strep bacteria all of it
[4669.04 - 4674.92] that squirrel trust me that's only you
[4673.06 - 4677.71] got to worry about restaurants bathroom
[4674.92 - 4679.48] doors bathroom toilets in the white you
[4677.71 - 4698.62] got you carry the spray I'm not worried
[4679.48 - 4701.58] about a squirrel that's a good question
[4698.62 - 4704.23] the sport listen I'm doing all this work
[4701.58 - 4705.85] it's so true it's like we worry about
[4704.23 - 4707.17] and it's good you wash things because
[4705.85 - 4708.91] when you go to the store seriously
[4707.17 - 4710.35] Elizabeth so important when you go to
[4708.91 - 4712.84] the store and you get things you want to
[4710.35 - 4715.27] wash them yeah so don't get me wrong
[4712.84 - 4718.15] it's yes I'm glad you in the habit you
[4715.27 - 4720.04] pump your lemon off the tree yes and you
[4718.15 - 4721.24] rinse it stay in that habit because I
[4720.04 - 4723.76] don't want you to not rinse a
[4721.24 - 4725.17] store-bought lemon yeah and and for
[4723.76 - 4726.73] these reasons so seriously so I don't
[4725.17 - 4728.89] want people get the wrong message the
[4726.73 - 4730.42] other thing is those elevated biotics
[4728.89 - 4732.52] they're on an apple and an apple orchard
[4730.42 - 4735.01] if you go to pick your own apples like
[4732.52 - 4738.01] once a year yeah if you get that
[4735.01 - 4740.77] elevated biotic once a year and you it
[4738.01 - 4745.15] goes into the ileum it stays in there
[4740.77 - 4746.80] for years but we never get it in us and
[4745.15 - 4748.33] we don't get enough of it and then we
[4746.80 - 4749.25] are the metals and all the other things
[4748.33 - 4751.44] we have in our body
[4749.25 - 4753.45] that knock them down right but it's the
[4751.44 - 4755.43] strongest microorganism that build your
[4753.45 - 4757.47] b12 keeps your gut healthy so you don't
[4755.43 - 4758.91] get the SIBO which is streptococcus or
[4757.47 - 4760.59] anything else but did you have to ask
[4758.91 - 4762.78] them if they spray like you have to go
[4760.59 - 4763.50] to a place where they're not on organic
[4762.78 - 4766.53] forms now
[4763.50 - 4769.02] yeah and a lot of there's a lot of non
[4766.53 - 4771.51] spray forms they're not organic but they
[4769.02 - 4772.65] don't spray design yeah which is fun
[4771.51 - 4774.93] like the whole farmer's market in
[4772.65 - 4777.27] California is right yes it's all like
[4774.93 - 4778.92] that hole it's hard to get certain oh
[4777.27 - 4781.26] that's hard to get certification but it
[4778.92 - 4783.20] doesn't mean that they're you know GMO
[4781.26 - 4786.23] or spraying and stuff like that I'm
[4783.20 - 4786.23] blown away
[4787.49 - 4795.47] powerful stories no I can I'll keep you
[4790.35 - 4799.08] guys powerful stories of healing and and
[4795.47 - 4801.51] it's no joke these stories because these
[4799.08 - 4802.83] are real experiences and you guys have
[4801.51 - 4804.69] gone through it there so what would you
[4802.83 - 4805.86] say you guys feel like saying anything
[4804.69 - 4808.59] to anybody who's struggling right now
[4805.86 - 4812.10] who's in a bed right now or they're
[4808.59 - 4813.69] there they're functioning but they know
[4812.10 - 4815.16] they're not where they need to be and
[4813.69 - 4817.92] people don't understand all their
[4815.16 - 4819.84] different symptoms or you know what
[4817.92 - 4821.31] they're up against if you have any if
[4819.84 - 4823.65] you have something to say to the women
[4821.31 - 4825.78] out there and men too and I worry about
[4823.65 - 4830.31] children yes you know I've seen
[4825.78 - 4832.35] daughters and sons at 14 15 16 years old
[4830.31 - 4834.57] and mom's just frantic because they're
[4832.35 - 4836.61] diagnosed with Lyme disease or diagnosed
[4834.57 - 4839.13] with autoimmune or a thyroid problem if
[4836.61 - 4844.92] you have any words to the moms out there
[4839.13 - 4845.76] that anything as a mom you know we you
[4844.92 - 4847.71] know I don't want to get into like
[4845.76 - 4849.69] gender roles there were never been a lot
[4847.71 - 4852.72] of mommies do the shopping and you know
[4849.69 - 4855.33] kind of control what comes in to the
[4852.72 - 4857.76] house and I think that you know I'm not
[4855.33 - 4859.83] crazy we have you know we have some junk
[4857.76 - 4862.41] in our house but generally we have a
[4859.83 - 4864.75] foundation and a base for nutrition and
[4862.41 - 4866.22] a lot of its based in this stuff and I
[4864.75 - 4868.38] get it in where I can you know my
[4866.22 - 4870.51] daughter she's not we're not like crazy
[4868.38 - 4874.35] you know juicing and she's totally vegan
[4870.51 - 4876.60] she's not but you know maybe more 80%
[4874.35 - 4879.00] 20% and you know it's just really to
[4876.60 - 4882.22] protect her overall health going forward
[4879.00 - 4884.17] and you know cold and flu season
[4882.22 - 4887.35] coming up and you know might be nice to
[4884.17 - 4889.36] give her a little zinc or b12 or you
[4887.35 - 4891.25] know just fortify her and build her up
[4889.36 - 4893.11] in a way because the world is you know
[4891.25 - 4895.93] there's a lot out there
[4893.11 - 4898.36] but to someone who's in bed struggling I
[4895.93 - 4900.73] think I've said it all yeah I really
[4898.36 - 4903.25] just I want people to there's hope
[4900.73 - 4905.98] there's there's hope is we can you know
[4903.25 - 4907.30] I want to say to someone who heals
[4905.98 - 4909.79] because you know I used to listen to
[4907.30 - 4911.86] Anthony say like you can heal and you

[4911.86 - 4917.53] that your life can get better all I
[4914.95 - 4919.60] wanted was a normal amount of pain and
[4917.53 - 4922.57] suffering I didn't want to be inundated
[4919.60 - 4925.69] with symptoms and so much that I didn't
[4922.57 - 4928.78] feel like I wanted to live and you know

[4932.41 - 4937.18] and the ones that we take for granted
