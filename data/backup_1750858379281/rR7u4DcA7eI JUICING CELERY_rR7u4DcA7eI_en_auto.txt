[120.56 - 124.24] the medical medium
[121.92 - 126.00] podcast if you if you if you feel
[124.24 - 126.80] inclined you want somebody else to hear
[126.00 - 128.56] that episode
[126.80 - 129.92] it's a mind blower so i'm going to juice
[128.56 - 131.84] some celery because
[129.92 - 134.56] then i thought about it because the
[131.84 - 136.56] thing is most of the people that i know
[134.56 - 137.68] that got off of caffeine so most of the
[136.56 - 140.08] people that i know
[137.68 - 141.12] they used celery juice to get off of it
[140.08 - 142.88] and
[141.12 - 144.24] would be like well how's that how's that
[142.88 - 147.44] going to work it
[144.24 - 149.12] does it has that kind of power because
[147.44 - 151.04] what the celery juice does is it
[149.12 - 152.56] it's a complete electrolyte and when
[151.04 - 155.76] that complete electrolyte
[152.56 - 157.04] goes to the brain that's when you can do
[155.76 - 158.56] the switch off
[157.04 - 160.72] then i talked about that so in the
[158.56 - 162.96] episode you got to check this out okay
[160.72 - 164.96] in the episode you got to hear how that
[162.96 - 168.24] works by the way this juice right here
[164.96 - 170.00] uh 20 off on this omega juicer my
[168.24 - 171.84] favorite juicer which is incredible so
[170.00 - 173.28] it's 20 off right now i think it's

[173.28 - 176.72] you check that out
[174.56 - 178.16] and um which is incredible and this
[176.72 - 179.20] juicer is my favorite you guys know that
[178.16 - 182.80] i licensed
[179.20 - 184.32] my name to this company here i said yeah
[182.80 - 186.08] just use my name if you want it's my
[184.32 - 187.04] favorite juicer go ahead use the name i
[186.08 - 189.36] licensed my name
[187.04 - 190.40] you guys know that and but this is my
[189.36 - 193.12] favorite juicer
[190.40 - 194.88] and it squeezes every last drop and
[193.12 - 196.56] that's what i love about it it squeezes
[194.88 - 199.36] every last drop out of it
[196.56 - 201.28] that's what i dig about it but so back
[199.36 - 204.16] to this whole thing with the caffeine
[201.28 - 204.72] episode it's like it's like well okay
[204.16 - 206.64] there's a heat
[204.72 - 207.92] i put healing tools in that episode
[206.64 - 209.52] powerful healing tools
[207.92 - 211.92] so you can get off the caffeine if you
[209.52 - 213.28] want all right and i talk about like
[211.92 - 216.32] what caffeine does
[213.28 - 218.16] to our adrenals what it does to the to
[216.32 - 219.60] the emotional center of the brain how we
[218.16 - 222.32] get dependent on it
[219.60 - 223.12] and how it kind of sucks the life out of
[222.32 - 225.68] us
[223.12 - 228.00] it's not an even trade-off and i talk
[225.68 - 231.04] about that about caffeine how caffeine
[228.00 - 232.72] is not an even trade-off you guys it's
[231.04 - 234.56] not i'm about to juice some celery juice
[232.72 - 236.72] if you just got on here some celery
[234.56 - 237.84] so but the even trade-off i'm talking
[236.72 - 240.32] about is what
[237.84 - 241.44] that caffeine does it's a powerful
[240.32 - 243.60] diuretic
[241.44 - 245.76] and it sucks out your trace minerals
[243.60 - 247.68] trace minerals that are in here
[245.76 - 248.96] so it draws out those trace minerals out
[247.68 - 250.56] of your cells
[248.96 - 252.32] that's what caffeine does it acts like
[250.56 - 253.76] that powerful diuretic that just sucks
[252.32 - 254.80] the life out of you it's like the
[253.76 - 256.64] vampire
[254.80 - 258.08] is what it is you have your cup of
[256.64 - 259.20] vampire that's what you do
[258.08 - 261.12] it's like i'm gonna have my cup of
[259.20 - 263.52] vampire right now and
[261.12 - 265.52] so because it will suck the trace
[263.52 - 267.84] minerals and nutrients out of you
[265.52 - 270.16] just draw it out of you and then what's
[267.84 - 271.84] replacing it that's what i want to know
[270.16 - 273.52] like where are you replacing all those
[271.84 - 275.12] nutrients where are you replacing those
[273.52 - 275.76] trace minerals like where is it coming
[275.12 - 278.96] from
[275.76 - 279.28] like where and how so i was like well
[278.96 - 281.04] look
[279.28 - 283.12] let me just juice some celery for you
[281.04 - 285.84] guys so you guys know like how
[283.12 - 287.28] many of the people i know got off of

[332.72 - 336.88] and um it's making some noise so just
[336.32 - 339.84] bear with
[336.88 - 339.84] it
[340.08 - 347.20] so what i like about this model is
[343.76 - 350.72] i mean in my opinion i've used every
[347.20 - 351.36] machine every machine i mean i've
[350.72 - 353.04] purchased
[351.36 - 354.40] every machine when i purchased this
[353.04 - 356.16] machine
[354.40 - 357.68] any of the mega machines over the years
[356.16 - 359.84] it's like well why is that
[357.68 - 361.04] better how come it's always a better
[359.84 - 363.76] experience for me
[361.04 - 365.20] and that's why i like the omega machines
[363.76 - 366.08] so it's like why is it a better
[365.20 - 367.52] experience experience
[366.08 - 369.60] for me and everybody's asked me for
[367.52 - 370.08] years i hardly talk about they always
[369.60 - 372.80] ask
[370.08 - 373.44] what do you do like you sell it so i
[372.80 - 375.60] said
[373.44 - 377.04] no what do you do and i'm like what do
[375.60 - 379.68] you mean what do i do
[377.04 - 380.08] i told you i choose celery every day for
[379.68 - 383.36] well
[380.08 - 386.00] over 35 years or more and it's like well
[383.36 - 386.56] you know like what machine what tools
[386.00 - 388.72] they're like
[386.56 - 389.60] the mega just that's the one and this
[388.72 - 393.12] one's the uh
[389.60 - 396.24] mm-900 hds just so you know
[393.12 - 398.00] so you can check that out but
[396.24 - 400.16] the key about this what i like about
[398.00 - 401.76] this machine is this stuff comes out so
[400.16 - 403.76] dry it's ridiculous
[401.76 - 405.44] so you save money at the end of the year
[403.76 - 408.48] that's how i experience it
[405.44 - 411.68] like my experience is i actually
[408.48 - 415.12] save because i'm juicing less
[411.68 - 417.52] celery and when i'm juicing less celery
[415.12 - 418.72] then boom it's like okay well i'm buying
[417.52 - 421.20] less celery
[418.72 - 422.00] that's what i love about this model it's
[421.20 - 425.36] like i'm buying
[422.00 - 428.48] less celery because i'm juicing less
[425.36 - 429.68] and i'm getting more juice per stock and
[428.48 - 431.44] everybody's got their opinion on what
[429.68 - 433.76] juice do they like if you guys
[431.44 - 435.36] if you have a juicer use that juicer you
[433.76 - 436.72] guys got a juicer that you like a
[435.36 - 438.32] favorite juicer you like just
[436.72 - 440.48] keep using that juicer you know i tell
[438.32 - 442.56] people if
[440.48 - 444.32] if you love doing it with a blender do
[442.56 - 446.56] it with a blender
[444.32 - 448.64] i've been saying that for years i always
[446.56 - 450.96] tell people would you have a blender
[448.64 - 453.04] because if you got a blender just just
[450.96 - 454.56] um strain it through a cheesecloth a nut
[453.04 - 456.64] cloth
[454.56 - 458.96] a nut bag or a cheesecloth that's what
[456.64 - 460.56] you do because you want to strain it you
[458.96 - 464.88] want to strain your celery
[460.56 - 467.12] juice is what you want to do so um
[464.88 - 468.56] but anyway but if you're interested in
[467.12 - 469.92] if you don't have a machine or something
[468.56 - 470.64] that you like and you're looking for a
[469.92 - 472.24] machine

[634.16 - 636.64] always trying to gather an electrolyte
[635.68 - 638.40] every food we eat
[636.64 - 639.84] it's like electrolyte electrolyte we're
[638.40 - 642.48] trying to get little pieces but the
[639.84 - 644.80] celery juice is a complete electrolyte
[642.48 - 646.24] the power of that is incredible so when
[644.80 - 649.04] it's a complete electrolyte
[646.24 - 650.88] changes the game big time because what
[649.04 - 652.24] happens is caffeine goes into the
[650.88 - 654.00] emotional center of the brain it goes
[652.24 - 656.32] into all the neurons in the brain
[654.00 - 657.44] it triggers off adrenaline so adrenaline
[656.32 - 659.68] floods your brain
[657.44 - 661.68] and that can wear you down over time
[659.68 - 663.60] burn out the neurotransmitters
[661.68 - 665.68] burn out the neurons but yeah it gives
[663.60 - 666.80] you a rush it gets you through your day
[665.68 - 668.72] it can help push you through your day
[666.80 - 669.04] and i totally get it so many people need
[668.72 - 671.12] that
[669.04 - 673.68] because without it they can't function
[671.12 - 675.60] but what i like doing is restoring
[673.68 - 676.72] the like fixing the problem and
[675.60 - 678.88] restoring
[676.72 - 680.32] what's missing so that's what i like to
[678.88 - 682.96] do so the celery juice
[680.32 - 684.40] the health benefits that i like and talk
[682.96 - 684.96] about in the medical medium books is
[684.40 - 686.88] like
[684.96 - 688.32] is it's about that complete electric
[686.88 - 690.24] going to your
[688.32 - 692.40] neurons you know helping those
[690.24 - 695.16] electrical impulses fire up
[692.40 - 696.80] like rehydrating and restoring
[695.16 - 698.40] neurotransmitters you've got to have
[696.80 - 700.88] those neurotransmitters working
[698.40 - 701.92] they've got to be working so that's a
[700.88 - 703.12] big deal right there you're drinking
[701.92 - 704.80] celery now sarah
[703.12 - 706.32] and you're doing your jelly juice now
[704.80 - 710.64] incredible you guys are amazing
[706.32 - 712.96] so so um so the reason why
[710.64 - 713.84] there's there's no trade-off that's
[712.96 - 715.36] actually good with
[713.84 - 718.16] caffeine got to remember that it's not
[715.36 - 720.64] an equal trade-off it's like the vampire
[718.16 - 722.40] it just sucks the life out of us over
[720.64 - 722.88] time i talk about in the episode as far
[722.40 - 725.92] as it
[722.88 - 726.32] aging us so i know you'll hear all the
[725.92 - 728.64] time
[726.32 - 729.60] anti-aging anti-aging anti-aging no
[728.64 - 732.16] actually
[729.60 - 732.64] you know caffeine anything with caffeine
[732.16 - 736.00] in it's
[732.64 - 739.04] not anti-aging it's the opposite
[736.00 - 740.72] overtime caffeine is the boy who cried
[739.04 - 742.72] wolf with the adrenals where it's fight
[740.72 - 744.88] or flight fight or flight all the time
[742.72 - 746.32] so what i like about the celery juice is
[744.88 - 748.96] it's like restoring
[746.32 - 750.64] what has been taken from you all that
[748.96 - 751.44] adrenaline that's been pumping out of
[750.64 - 752.64] your adrenals
[751.44 - 754.56] every year while you're doing your
[752.64 - 756.32] caffeine right and
[754.56 - 758.80] who's doing that who's restoring your
[756.32 - 760.64] adrenals like who's doing that you guys
[758.80 - 762.76] who's restoring the adrenals
[760.64 - 764.16] who's restoring you know the
[762.76 - 765.60] neurotransmitters
[764.16 - 767.92] and that's what i love about the celery
[765.60 - 770.24] juice so it's like it's one thing
[767.92 - 771.20] you know and what i like about this
[770.24 - 773.84] juicer
[771.20 - 775.44] way better than any juicer i've used if
[773.84 - 777.04] you have a juicer you like just use that
[775.44 - 778.72] one if you have a blender you like use
[777.04 - 779.60] that one but this is the juicer that i
[778.72 - 782.56] like
[779.60 - 784.56] it's it the the pulp is light as air
[782.56 - 785.04] it's fluffy and light i mean hardly
[784.56 - 787.12] juiced
[785.04 - 788.72] anything like anything there's barely
[787.12 - 791.28] any pulp in this right here
[788.72 - 792.56] and i got a full container right now of
[791.28 - 794.00] celery juice i'm just going to show you
[792.56 - 796.00] right now
[794.00 - 798.48] and i didn't even scratch the surface
[796.00 - 799.60] which how much i washed a lot of celery
[798.48 - 803.12] right here
[799.60 - 804.96] and i mean i washed a lot of it and
[803.12 - 806.64] didn't even burn through i still got a
[804.96 - 808.08] pile right here didn't even burn through
[806.64 - 810.00] like hardly any of it right there and
[808.08 - 811.52] that's what i like about this juicer
[810.00 - 814.16] and someone said to me the other day
[811.52 - 815.76] well you like your juicer but that means
[814.16 - 817.28] you've only used that juicer
[815.76 - 819.92] company probably that juicer brand i'm
[817.28 - 823.52] like uh no i've tried every
[819.92 - 825.68] single juicer that was available
[823.52 - 826.88] over the years every one i'd be like
[825.68 - 828.00] okay i'm gonna try that one and be like
[826.88 - 830.16] whoa that's a hassle
[828.00 - 832.08] cleaning that or hey let me try this one
[830.16 - 832.40] no that's not giving me that much juice
[832.08 - 834.48] or
[832.40 - 835.52] let me try this one that's not so great
[834.48 - 837.12] and that's
[835.52 - 838.24] my experience you know you might have a
[837.12 - 839.44] better experience you might have a
[838.24 - 840.80] better experience with
[839.44 - 842.80] your juicer you might have a better
[840.80 - 844.16] experience with your blender
[842.80 - 846.00] you might have a better experience with
[844.16 - 847.44] something whatever you guys do but i
[846.00 - 848.32] love this one it's twenty percent off
[847.44 - 850.16] which is so cool
[848.32 - 852.48] save sixty dollars off this machine but
[850.16 - 854.80] what i like about for me
[852.48 - 856.00] i have too much going on i'm like really
[854.80 - 857.92] busy i'm writing
[856.00 - 859.20] books i got a book right now i'm writing
[857.92 - 861.20] for you guys
[859.20 - 862.88] and i got a lot going on got the medical
[861.20 - 865.68] medium podcast where i'm
[862.88 - 867.68] um you know throwing out those those
[865.68 - 870.00] killer episodes you know like
[867.68 - 871.12] the power packed episodes i hope you're
[870.00 - 872.40] getting into them i'm hoping you're
[871.12 - 873.68] doing the brain meditation i hope you're
[872.40 - 875.44] doing the moon meditation
[873.68 - 877.60] hope you're doing hope you're listening
[875.44 - 881.12] to that caffeine episode you guys can't
[877.60 - 882.80] miss the caffeine episode you can't and
[881.12 - 884.80] i mean seriously you'll be blown off
[882.80 - 886.80] your seat when you hear that episode
[884.80 - 888.08] so medical media podcasted apple podcast
[886.80 - 890.80] but i got a lot going on
[888.08 - 892.48] so i can't be cleaning a juicer all day
[890.80 - 894.64] long you know i can't be
[892.48 - 895.68] cleaning a juicer i i use celery juice
[894.64 - 898.16] twice a day
[895.68 - 898.96] a lot of days it's twice a day or i'll
[898.16 - 902.08] do a big
[898.96 - 903.60] load of it in the morning right and i
[902.08 - 905.92] just don't want to sit there cleaning a
[903.60 - 907.36] juicer all morning long so this is why i
[905.92 - 909.84] like this juicer
[907.36 - 910.80] i like it because for me for some reason
[909.84 - 912.40] it's just so much
[910.80 - 914.16] easier and i've tried a lot of them like
[912.40 - 915.68] oh my god what do i got to scrub and do
[914.16 - 918.64] and this one's less of all that
[915.68 - 919.68] my opinion um people ask me what my
[918.64 - 921.36] favorite juicer is
[919.68 - 922.80] so i thought i'd show you guys you know
[921.36 - 923.92] i thought i'd show you guys i've showed
[922.80 - 926.08] you before
[923.92 - 927.60] but everybody forgets or something you
[926.08 - 929.20] know they don't forget and then
[927.60 - 930.64] they start bombarding me with what's
[929.20 - 932.56] your favorite juicer over and over again
[930.64 - 934.24] until it finally gets to a point where
[932.56 - 935.92] it's like oh my god i have to i have to
[934.24 - 938.24] do this but the perfect thing is
[935.92 - 940.08] it's like wait a minute i you know if
[938.24 - 941.52] you really need to get off caffeine like
[940.08 - 942.80] if you're somebody that wants to get off
[941.52 - 944.40] the caffeine and you're someone that's
[942.80 - 946.08] trying to get off the caffeine
[944.40 - 947.76] or anything like that that you got an
[946.08 - 950.16] option it's like the celery juice is
[947.76 - 951.84] that way to break withdrawal
[950.16 - 953.60] and i talk about that in the caffeine

[1083.44 - 1086.32] margaret says she loves being off a
[1084.88 - 1087.84] coffee are you doing your celery juice
[1086.32 - 1089.12] did you use it to get off your coffee
[1087.84 - 1092.32] because so many people
[1089.12 - 1094.72] thousands and thousands of people used
[1092.32 - 1096.32] celery juice to get off of their coffee
[1094.72 - 1097.04] they use celery juice to get off of
[1096.32 - 1099.68] everything
[1097.04 - 1101.36] so um you know to get off anything they
[1099.68 - 1104.16] wanted to get off of whether it was like
[1101.36 - 1105.20] a chocolate addiction coffee addiction
[1104.16 - 1107.68] whether it was matcha
[1105.20 - 1108.48] whatever it was the caffeine addiction
[1107.68 - 1111.92] and
[1108.48 - 1115.44] but what happens is caffeine can rob you
[1111.92 - 1116.08] of your youth is what it does over the
[1115.44 - 1118.72] years
[1116.08 - 1120.48] and no one talks about that i talk about
[1118.72 - 1122.72] that in the episode how that works
[1120.48 - 1125.44] because it can rob you of your youth
[1122.72 - 1127.60] and it's really important to know and so
[1125.44 - 1130.00] it's like what are you doing to
[1127.60 - 1131.68] put back in how about this if you don't
[1130.00 - 1132.72] want to get off your caffeine
[1131.68 - 1135.44] if you don't want to get off your
[1132.72 - 1137.28] caffeine how about if you're doing your
[1135.44 - 1138.24] celery juice to put back in what's
[1137.28 - 1140.00] coming out
[1138.24 - 1141.92] at least try that where you're putting
[1140.00 - 1144.48] back in what you're
[1141.92 - 1145.20] losing so what caffeine is sucking out
[1144.48 - 1146.88] of you because
[1145.20 - 1148.48] if you just got on here caffeine sucks
[1146.88 - 1150.64] out the trace minerals
[1148.48 - 1152.00] sucks out antioxidants so it's like hey
[1150.64 - 1154.72] um you know my
[1152.00 - 1155.52] my caffeine choice has antioxidants in
[1154.72 - 1157.44] it chocolate
[1155.52 - 1159.36] matcha's got antioxidants in it coffee's
[1157.44 - 1161.04] got antioxidants well those antioxidants
[1159.36 - 1162.00] are just being sucked right out with
[1161.04 - 1164.56] that caffeine
[1162.00 - 1165.84] not only those but other antioxidants
[1164.56 - 1166.88] that you're getting anywhere else are
[1165.84 - 1168.72] getting sucked out
[1166.88 - 1170.24] so what are you doing to put it back in

[1205.20 - 1209.68] hds um i told you i licensed my name to
[1208.56 - 1210.56] the company because you're like well
[1209.68 - 1213.60] you've been using
[1210.56 - 1215.76] omega for how many years uh since the
[1213.60 - 1217.44] beginning and i tried every juicer
[1215.76 - 1219.12] and like well can we use your name and
[1217.44 - 1221.04] and yeah for sure of course
[1219.12 - 1222.56] let's let's do something let's do
[1221.04 - 1225.04] something together and so
[1222.56 - 1226.32] the key is is that well listen if you
[1225.04 - 1228.08] guys got a juicer you like
[1226.32 - 1229.84] keep with it okay if you guys got a
[1228.08 - 1230.40] blender you like keep with it you could
[1229.84 - 1232.16] strain
[1230.40 - 1234.32] you guys could blend it strain it
[1232.16 - 1236.72] through a nut bag or a cheesecloth okay
[1234.32 - 1238.72] totally and it only takes a few minutes
[1236.72 - 1240.72] to make juice with this it's incredible
[1238.72 - 1241.76] only takes a few minutes and it saves so
[1240.72 - 1243.92] much time
[1241.76 - 1245.68] so that's what i love about it it's like
[1243.92 - 1248.48] i look i told you
[1245.68 - 1249.04] this saves you money with how much juice
[1248.48 - 1251.92] you get
[1249.04 - 1253.60] out of a stock that's the difference i
[1251.92 - 1256.00] barely used any celery
[1253.60 - 1256.96] i got a pile here i haven't even touched
[1256.00 - 1258.56] you see the pile
[1256.96 - 1261.20] haven't even scratched the surface of
[1258.56 - 1262.08] that pile and it's saving me money every
[1261.20 - 1264.96] year my experience
[1262.08 - 1266.56] is i save lots of money on salary every
[1264.96 - 1267.76] single year with this model so it's like
[1266.56 - 1270.64] okay what's the trade-off
[1267.76 - 1272.88] well it's 20 off right now get a deal on
[1270.64 - 1274.96] it number one and then whatever it costs
[1272.88 - 1276.64] you actually make back by the end of the
[1274.96 - 1279.52] year plus some
[1276.64 - 1281.52] so i like a machine that pays for itself
[1279.52 - 1283.60] that's my whole thing and it's quiet
[1281.52 - 1285.28] it's quiet in the morning in case you
[1283.60 - 1286.64] got you know family or something you
[1285.28 - 1288.72] don't want to wake up and you don't want
[1286.64 - 1289.52] to run a loud machine this one's really
[1288.72 - 1291.92] quiet
[1289.52 - 1293.68] but my deal is like i like i like
[1291.92 - 1295.84] knowing i have a machine that's
[1293.68 - 1297.36] paying for itself and that's what i like
[1295.84 - 1298.32] knowing so it's like what you're paying
[1297.36 - 1300.72] for yourself
[1298.32 - 1302.56] that's pretty awesome and this machine
[1300.72 - 1305.04] for me has already paid for itself
[1302.56 - 1306.00] over and over and over again but you
[1305.04 - 1308.24] know
[1306.00 - 1310.24] the celery juice is a big part of how to

[1631.12 - 1635.36] how cool is that
[1633.12 - 1637.52] uh sabine says how do you store the
[1635.36 - 1640.32] celery when you pre-washed it
[1637.52 - 1641.76] you know what i do i take i take a like
[1640.32 - 1645.36] a dish washing cloth
[1641.76 - 1648.48] like a dry clean one and after i wash
[1645.36 - 1650.72] the celery i kind of just wrap it in it
[1648.48 - 1651.84] and just wrap it in it i got one right
[1650.72 - 1653.84] here you guys
[1651.84 - 1655.04] that's the cloth right here so what i do
[1653.84 - 1657.28] is i pre-wash it
[1655.04 - 1658.80] and i wrap it in there like that and you
[1657.28 - 1660.16] know put a big hunk of it
[1658.80 - 1662.00] just like you see all the celery right
[1660.16 - 1663.20] here and i put it in the fridge and i
[1662.00 - 1664.56] just have it sitting there it's going to
[1663.20 - 1667.12] be in there for a day
[1664.56 - 1668.56] or two right that's one way to do it
[1667.12 - 1670.08] there's other ways you guys can come up
[1668.56 - 1672.08] with your own way of doing it too
[1670.08 - 1674.08] i mean there's other ways you can also
[1672.08 - 1676.16] do you have a damp cloth wrapped around
[1674.08 - 1677.84] it which is a great way of doing it too
[1676.16 - 1679.68] there's nothing wrong with that at all
[1677.84 - 1682.56] so yeah so
[1679.68 - 1684.16] um anyway so the bottom line okay
[1682.56 - 1685.04] medical media podcast did you check out
[1684.16 - 1686.88] the caffeine
[1685.04 - 1688.96] episode link is in the description have
[1686.88 - 1691.60] you done the meditations
[1688.96 - 1692.16] and have you shared them have you shared
[1691.60 - 1695.36] them
[1692.16 - 1696.16] um lorraine l says brain meditation is
[1695.36 - 1698.88] otherworldly
[1696.16 - 1699.28] that's the greatest compliment like i
[1698.88 - 1701.92] could
[1699.28 - 1703.84] get because you know i don't know if you
[1701.92 - 1704.72] guys know but i'm discriminated against
[1703.84 - 1707.04] because of
[1704.72 - 1708.32] my source of spirit of compassion since
[1707.04 - 1710.40] i was age four
[1708.32 - 1712.08] and when i was age four and spirit of
[1710.40 - 1712.96] compassion started speaking to me which
[1712.08 - 1714.88] people are like well
[1712.96 - 1716.56] wait a minute what is that how does that
[1714.88 - 1717.92] work and the millions have actually
[1716.56 - 1719.60] healed around the world because of the
[1717.92 - 1722.72] medical medium information
[1719.60 - 1724.40] and and when you when like lorraine when
[1722.72 - 1725.92] you know that it's otherworldly because
[1724.40 - 1729.20] it's not man-made like
[1725.92 - 1729.84] i'm not me i can't make a meditation
[1729.20 - 1732.88] like that
[1729.84 - 1736.16] like i can't and it comes from above
[1732.88 - 1737.12] so it works it's not hit or miss it it
[1736.16 - 1738.80] works
[1737.12 - 1740.16] and it's a powerhouse and that one i
[1738.80 - 1741.60] feel kind of guilty
[1740.16 - 1743.28] lorraine i feel kind of guilty that i
[1741.60 - 1744.88] coveted that one when i was younger a
[1743.28 - 1745.68] little bit i just had it for family and
[1744.88 - 1747.68] friends
[1745.68 - 1749.44] and then i realized with everything
[1747.68 - 1750.88] going on why doesn't everybody have the
[1749.44 - 1753.84] brain meditation
[1750.88 - 1755.04] and i need you guys to have that so

[1844.64 - 1847.76] look it's like this it's one thing to

[1847.76 - 1852.00] hey get off your caffeine maybe you
[1850.16 - 1854.56] shouldn't be on your caffeine
[1852.00 - 1855.04] it's not good for you that's just not
[1854.56 - 1857.60] really
[1855.04 - 1858.96] like that's not helping really anybody
[1857.60 - 1862.24] but it's another
[1858.96 - 1864.00] to say here's why you should probably
[1862.24 - 1865.68] get off your caffeine
[1864.00 - 1867.44] listen to the episode so you can just
[1865.68 - 1870.80] your mind just blow like
[1867.44 - 1873.12] bro like right that information comes in
[1870.80 - 1874.80] and you know like okay here's what's
[1873.12 - 1877.76] going on well what can i do
[1874.80 - 1879.20] what can i do now you know aw you told
[1877.76 - 1880.08] me what's going on with caffeine what
[1879.20 - 1884.32] can i do
[1880.08 - 1887.04] well then tools to restore
[1884.32 - 1888.16] and that caffeine sits in that emotional
[1887.04 - 1890.00] center of the brain
[1888.16 - 1892.16] it attaches itself to all kinds of
[1890.00 - 1895.12] neurotransmitters attaches itself
[1892.16 - 1896.40] to neurons sits in there a long time
[1895.12 - 1898.24] just causes a lot of trouble
[1896.40 - 1900.88] withdrawal becomes impossible for most
[1898.24 - 1903.84] people do something about it if you want
[1900.88 - 1903.84] that's the whole point
[1904.16 - 1907.92] sharon says celery juice kills my
[1905.68 - 1908.64] stomach just a tiny little tiny little
[1907.92 - 1910.08] bit
[1908.64 - 1911.68] tiny a little bit if you want talk to
[1910.08 - 1913.52] your doctor about it if you're concerned
[1911.68 - 1916.08] or anything we could do a tiny little
[1913.52 - 1917.84] tiny little bit of it and because what
[1916.08 - 1919.76] that celery juice does it's so

[1981.60 - 1984.72] because
[1982.56 - 1986.40] i had to listen to it again and i'm the
[1984.72 - 1987.84] one that did it
[1986.40 - 1990.48] and i listened to it again because i'm
[1987.84 - 1990.88] like oh yeah and oh yeah you know yeah
[1990.48 - 1993.60] it's
[1990.88 - 1994.56] packed with information it's packed with
[1993.60 - 1998.80] information
[1994.56 - 2001.36] and and i'm honored you're listening um
[1998.80 - 2003.68] so vegan sabina says coffee is a drug
[2001.36 - 2006.08] it's pretty intense stuff i mean
[2003.68 - 2006.96] it's print caffeine is pretty intense
[2006.08 - 2010.00] stuff and
[2006.96 - 2013.60] we get trapped in it and stuck to it
[2010.00 - 2015.12] and married to it and attached to it
[2013.60 - 2016.64] so it's really tricky you know it's
[2015.12 - 2019.52] really tricky and getting off of it
[2016.64 - 2021.60] it's another story but i got the mm-900
[2019.52 - 2022.48] hds right here so this is the model that
[2021.60 - 2024.72] i use
[2022.48 - 2026.16] my favorite model my favorite company
[2024.72 - 2027.28] but this is the one that squeezes every
[2026.16 - 2030.40] last bit of juice
[2027.28 - 2030.96] out of those stocks i personally save
[2030.40 - 2032.96] money
[2030.96 - 2035.04] from using this machine it's paid for
[2032.96 - 2036.64] itself over and over again
[2035.04 - 2038.96] you know and because when people say
[2036.64 - 2040.88] well juicers are expensive well this one
[2038.96 - 2042.24] it really isn't that expensive at all
[2040.88 - 2044.40] compared to some of the juicers out
[2042.24 - 2047.76] there oh my god they're off the charts
[2044.40 - 2050.16] and this one pays for itself and it's 60
[2047.76 - 2050.80] off right now 20 off like it's it's
[2050.16 - 2052.80] crazy
[2050.80 - 2054.40] so but this is the one that i like to
[2052.80 - 2056.56] use because i save money
[2054.40 - 2059.04] but i know i'm saving money by the end
[2056.56 - 2062.16] of the year i juice a lot of celery
[2059.04 - 2063.44] and i know i'm saving money at the end
[2062.16 - 2065.44] of the year it's so important
[2063.44 - 2066.96] so the brain meditation is good you got
[2065.44 - 2067.76] to keep the brain meditation going
[2066.96 - 2071.04] because
[2067.76 - 2073.68] that brain meditation wilma is powerful
[2071.04 - 2074.16] and it will just keep on healing every
[2073.68 - 2075.20] time

[2101.20 - 2104.56] just you know not going to be what it is
[2103.92 - 2106.32] so you want to
[2104.56 - 2108.32] want to listen to that apple podcast
[2106.32 - 2110.80] margaret valentine how is that different
[2108.32 - 2113.28] from the other omega juicers
[2110.80 - 2114.96] this one's specific for celery juice you
[2113.28 - 2117.36] can use it for other things too
[2114.96 - 2119.52] but it's specific for celery juice so it
[2117.36 - 2122.24] actually has in this control
[2119.52 - 2123.12] right here it actually has a tool in
[2122.24 - 2126.40] here
[2123.12 - 2129.52] okay that allows you to squeeze
[2126.40 - 2130.00] every last drop practically out of there
[2129.52 - 2132.80] i mean it's
[2130.00 - 2133.84] amazing just amazing as far as like dry
[2132.80 - 2136.64] to the bone
[2133.84 - 2137.68] and you use less celery because of it
[2136.64 - 2140.00] and
[2137.68 - 2141.68] i haven't found that experience and i've
[2140.00 - 2144.16] i've purchased
[2141.68 - 2144.88] every juicer that's in this realm and
[2144.16 - 2146.96] even above
[2144.88 - 2149.36] meaning price wise to be like okay i
[2146.96 - 2150.88] just i'm biting i'm biting let me do it
[2149.36 - 2152.32] they're trying you know you go in there
[2150.88 - 2153.36] you look for different juicers like
[2152.32 - 2155.04] what's this company do and they're
[2153.36 - 2156.72] selling some juicer let me get it
[2155.04 - 2158.08] and then you're like what i'm killing
[2156.72 - 2160.24] myself to clean it
[2158.08 - 2161.84] and then at the top not this juicer but
[2160.24 - 2162.48] trying other juicers and killing myself
[2161.84 - 2163.60] to clean them
[2162.48 - 2165.60] and then it's not squeezing all the
[2163.60 - 2167.12] juice out of them and then i'm like
[2165.60 - 2169.04] it's costing me money to juice celery
[2167.12 - 2170.24] it's like what this makes no sense this
[2169.04 - 2171.68] is the one i believe in
[2170.24 - 2174.08] but just use the juicer you love it's
[2171.68 - 2177.44] it's perfectly fine you guys know that
[2174.08 - 2180.08] um sandra says it produces more juice
[2177.44 - 2182.00] than some of the others i've noticed yes
[2180.08 - 2184.80] sandra it does
[2182.00 - 2186.40] it does it's that's what i love about it
[2184.80 - 2187.76] i love about it so
[2186.40 - 2189.76] and you know it's like everybody's
[2187.76 - 2192.32] always asking me what juicer i use
[2189.76 - 2193.76] but i'm like okay well you use sour
[2192.32 - 2194.40] juice to get off caffeine let's just
[2193.76 - 2196.48] like
[2194.40 - 2198.40] juice some celery so everybody has like
[2196.48 - 2199.44] they can see like wait a minute i can
[2198.40 - 2202.56] get off caffeine
[2199.44 - 2204.48] i can do this susan darling hey how are
[2202.56 - 2205.04] you after juicing celery juice for a
[2204.48 - 2207.92] week
[2205.04 - 2210.08] i could not tolerate caffeine so celery
[2207.92 - 2212.32] juice made me want to come off caffeine
[2210.08 - 2213.60] i'll tell you why that's really cool
[2212.32 - 2216.72] i'll tell you why
[2213.60 - 2218.48] because it's a complete electrolyte so
[2216.72 - 2220.00] the trace mineral salts the subgroup of
[2218.48 - 2222.08] sodium that it has okay
[2220.00 - 2223.28] sodium cluster salts i talk about in the
[2222.08 - 2226.08] medical medium books
[2223.28 - 2227.36] go to the brain to where you're caffeine
[2226.08 - 2230.00] dependent
[2227.36 - 2230.64] so we get caffeine dependent in the
[2230.00 - 2232.08] brain
[2230.64 - 2234.24] that's what happens we get cathy
[2232.08 - 2236.88] dependent and we get caffeine dependent
[2234.24 - 2237.36] in the emotional center of the brain and
[2236.88 - 2239.20] then
[2237.36 - 2240.56] we're like oh my god we're in trouble
[2239.20 - 2241.68] when you get off that caffeine we're
[2240.56 - 2244.16] like withdrawal
[2241.68 - 2244.72] we just we get emotional we start losing
[2244.16 - 2247.44] it
[2244.72 - 2249.60] we all of that and so what the celery
[2247.44 - 2252.08] just does it's trading off
[2249.60 - 2253.28] it's also putting something back into
[2252.08 - 2255.60] you that caffeine
[2253.28 - 2256.72] sucking out of you and it's really an
[2255.60 - 2259.92] amazing thing so
[2256.72 - 2261.60] you know um kathy king celery juice has
[2259.92 - 2262.56] been a lifesaver for me over the last
[2261.60 - 2264.72] four years

[2286.48 - 2289.76] for medical medium the other old shows
[2288.08 - 2291.60] were old radio shows
[2289.76 - 2293.84] and and this is an entirely different
[2291.60 - 2296.88] story this is an uncensored version
[2293.84 - 2298.96] of packed with information so really

[2298.96 - 2304.88] um but yeah so much so much so tammy hey
[2302.64 - 2306.24] tammy i have a hard time getting organic
[2304.88 - 2308.32] celery
[2306.24 - 2309.28] is the regular celery going to work the
[2308.32 - 2312.16] same
[2309.28 - 2314.00] wash it good wash it good okay i used a
[2312.16 - 2315.12] little bit of natural dish soap a little
[2314.00 - 2317.68] bit of natural dish

[2317.68 - 2320.32] wash it good

[2320.32 - 2323.36] what your celery and you can't
[2322.16 - 2325.52] there's nothing that's going to clean
[2323.36 - 2326.00] your celery any better than when you
[2325.52 - 2328.32] take your
[2326.00 - 2329.52] thumb and you actually do this when
[2328.32 - 2330.00] you're under water and you take your
[2329.52 - 2332.48] thumb
[2330.00 - 2334.56] and you're rubbing that okay and you're
[2332.48 - 2337.68] just getting you know really good i use
[2334.56 - 2339.12] warm water so and that's what i do i
[2337.68 - 2341.36] have the sink running it's
[2339.12 - 2343.12] warm waters coming through and i rub my

[2432.64 - 2436.00] podcast check the link out in the
[2433.76 - 2437.52] description have you listened to it
[2436.00 - 2439.76] you're going to get mind blown you
[2437.52 - 2441.68] really are um
[2439.76 - 2443.68] so yeah and i'm so proud of you guys so
[2441.68 - 2445.92] this is this is the deal
[2443.68 - 2447.52] is that when i get up in the morning i
[2445.92 - 2449.36] don't have a lot of time
[2447.52 - 2450.96] i'm working on the podcast trying to get
[2449.36 - 2453.12] you guys episodes
[2450.96 - 2454.88] i'm working on the book the next book to
[2453.12 - 2458.24] deliver you guys
[2454.88 - 2460.56] and i'm just i'm working 20 hours a day
[2458.24 - 2462.24] right now and getting probably three to
[2460.56 - 2465.60] four hours of sleep some night so
[2462.24 - 2468.72] i'm working 20 hours a day and
[2465.60 - 2469.60] i don't have time to spend all this time
[2468.72 - 2471.36] cleaning and
[2469.60 - 2473.04] juicing and all that so i like this
[2471.36 - 2474.16] model because of that it just saves me
[2473.04 - 2477.52] time and a whole bit
[2474.16 - 2479.20] um you know start if you if you have a
[2477.52 - 2482.56] lot of symptoms you can always start
[2479.20 - 2483.76] slow with the celery juice
[2482.56 - 2485.36] if you got a lot of symptoms you could
[2483.76 - 2487.60] always start slow you don't have to do
[2485.36 - 2489.12] 32 ounces you don't have to do 30 ounces
[2487.60 - 2490.16] you don't have to do 28 ounces start
[2489.12 - 2491.76] slow if you want
[2490.16 - 2493.52] you can do that you guys can do that
[2491.76 - 2496.64] start with four ounces you can do that
[2493.52 - 2496.64] as well start with four ounces
[2496.96 - 2501.28] you can definitely do that nothing wrong
[2498.80 - 2504.72] at all but what it does is
[2501.28 - 2506.24] celery juice is a pathogen killer
[2504.72 - 2508.08] so what it does is it breaks down
[2506.24 - 2509.92] membranes and pathogens
[2508.08 - 2511.60] the membrane around pathogens and it
[2509.92 - 2512.88] starts to weaken them
[2511.60 - 2515.44] and that's what's incredible and people
[2512.88 - 2517.28] are sick because of epstein-barr viruses
[2515.44 - 2518.80] cytomegalovirus shingles virus they're
[2517.28 - 2519.44] sick because of streptococcus different
[2518.80 - 2520.80] kinds of
[2519.44 - 2523.20] you know bacteria they're sick from all
[2520.80 - 2525.84] this stuff i talk about it all the time
[2523.20 - 2527.84] sabine says sweeney says i i'm drinking

[2765.28 - 2768.88] compassion's number
[2766.32 - 2770.16] 16 ounces once a day on an empty stomach
[2768.88 - 2773.04] don't mix anything in it
[2770.16 - 2775.04] okay that's that's really important i
[2773.04 - 2776.48] like that for people i like 32 ounces
[2775.04 - 2777.52] depending on what symptoms conditions
[2776.48 - 2779.76] you're dealing with
[2777.52 - 2780.56] what's going on even more than 32 ounces

[2797.60 - 2800.96] all right like you know how to wash your
[2799.12 - 2802.16] celery i showed that to you um that
[2800.96 - 2804.08] little trick there
[2802.16 - 2806.72] today where you want to get the dirt out
[2804.08 - 2808.56] of the inside of the stalks ray
[2806.72 - 2810.40] all of that showed you my favorite
[2808.56 - 2812.48] juicer where i save money using this
[2810.40 - 2813.76] juicer it pays for itself to me that
[2812.48 - 2815.28] matters
[2813.76 - 2817.36] and because i've used every juicer out
[2815.28 - 2818.80] there and um
[2817.36 - 2821.92] check out the medical mean podcast at
[2818.80 - 2824.32] apple podcast link is in the description
[2821.92 - 2825.68] and dorothy says how much coffee is too
[2824.32 - 2829.12] much dorothy you know what's
[2825.68 - 2830.08] crazy is that sometimes just a drop of
[2829.12 - 2832.32] coffee
[2830.08 - 2833.68] if someone sensitive can throw them in
[2832.32 - 2836.72] an anxiety attack
[2833.68 - 2838.24] like panic attack a drop there's people
[2836.72 - 2840.08] out there that if they smell it in a
[2838.24 - 2842.80] coffee shop
[2840.08 - 2844.32] and and they smell that caffeine and the
[2842.80 - 2845.76] caffeine starts going into the lungs
[2844.32 - 2847.28] into and gets to the brain and they're
[2845.76 - 2849.60] breathing in in their sinuses
[2847.28 - 2851.36] they literally start falling apart it
[2849.60 - 2853.04] all depends on what the person's level
[2851.36 - 2853.84] is that can handle that kind of toxin
[2853.04 - 2856.00] and poison
[2853.84 - 2857.60] because caffeine's a toxin and poison
[2856.00 - 2859.84] it's a bad toxin and poison
[2857.60 - 2861.60] so it all depends like how much coffee
[2859.84 - 2862.96] is too much some people can handle a lot
[2861.60 - 2864.56] of coffee all day long
[2862.96 - 2866.32] doesn't mean it's not robbing you of
[2864.56 - 2868.00] your youth taking from you taking your
[2866.32 - 2869.36] trace minerals taking your
[2868.00 - 2870.96] beating down your neurotransmitters but
[2869.36 - 2872.40] there's people out there with sensitive
[2870.96 - 2873.20] nervous systems and they've been through
[2872.40 - 2874.96] hell and back
[2873.20 - 2876.80] with their health and man they have a
[2874.96 - 2879.84] thimble of coffee and
[2876.80 - 2882.96] it's awful so anyway so
[2879.84 - 2884.48] um anyway but bottom line is guys
