[4.60 - 8.12] show where each week I talk about the
[6.16 - 10.28] most advanced healing
[8.12 - 12.84] information and secrets about health
[10.28 - 15.20] much of which is not found anywhere else
[12.84 - 17.80] and is decades ahead of what's out there
[15.20 - 20.44] now as I've always said who has 10 or 20
[17.80 - 22.44] years 30 years to wait for answers who

[33.40 - 39.28] of being you know human is is patience
[37.32 - 41.40] but we we we need answers though we need
[39.28 - 43.24] answers cuz when we don't feel good it
[41.40 - 46.20] feels like a week is a lifetime when you
[43.24 - 47.48] don't feel good that's how it works this
[46.20 - 49.68] is the only Health show where the

[224.32 - 230.20] is a this is a a very very important
[227.76 - 233.00] subject very important subject I can't
[230.20 - 235.56] tell you how many people have uh come to
[233.00 - 237.88] me over the years and especially when I
[235.56 - 239.96] had the office in the old days how many
[237.88 - 243.92] people came to my office with this situ
[239.96 - 247.64] situation and um you think it's not a
[243.92 - 249.12] big deal you know as if a man hears
[247.64 - 251.20] about it it's not a big deal it's like
[249.12 - 253.88] okay what is that well meanwhile it
[251.20 - 256.48] could be a big deal it could get pretty
[253.88 - 258.16] serious I've had a lot of women that
[256.48 - 263.12] that have come to my office that I mean
[258.16 - 265.56] they've had size of of of um I mean just
[263.12 - 269.68] size of eggs fibroids the size of eggs
[265.56 - 272.16] bigger than eggs I mean so big like even
[269.68 - 274.08] grapefruit size they can get really big
[272.16 - 276.68] really disruptive really problematic
[274.08 - 279.44] really difficult to deal with um
[276.68 - 282.96] bleeding can occur just lots and lots of
[279.44 - 287.20] bleeding lots of difficulties and it's
[282.96 - 290.00] not an easy thing at all to deal with um
[287.20 - 291.40] and and sometimes surgery is you know
[290.00 - 293.80] optional sometimes it's not even
[291.40 - 295.16] optional with this it's unbelievable
[293.80 - 298.36] with women have gone through I've seen
[295.16 - 301.20] it all and it's uterine fibroids both on
[298.36 - 303.56] top of the uterus ins inside the uterus
[301.20 - 306.68] and um it's it's been it's given women a
[303.56 - 308.64] lot of difficult decisions to make um
[306.68 - 311.32] and it's been just cumbersome and in the
[308.64 - 313.04] way in so many in so many ways so I I
[311.32 - 315.88] just think this is an
[313.04 - 318.44] important aspect of chronic
[315.88 - 320.80] illness that you know that needs
[318.44 - 322.40] attention on the medical Medium show
[320.80 - 325.04] bottom line it needs attention and
[322.40 - 326.96] attention that hasn't been contaminated
[325.04 - 329.08] with you know private panel of
[326.96 - 330.68] influencers that just want you to think
[329.08 - 332.08] fibroid is a certain thing or a certain
[330.68 - 335.16] way or whatever because that's where the
[332.08 - 336.72] money went and um because the agenda
[335.16 - 339.04] goes you know with money and that's how
[336.72 - 341.00] it works both now in uh alternative
[339.04 - 343.00] medicine so misinformation is out there
[341.00 - 344.84] everywhere on the internet everywhere
[343.00 - 347.28] everywhere you look about fibroids and
[344.84 - 348.96] if you even look into it you someone was
[347.28 - 351.04] telling me also recently and they said
[348.96 - 353.92] you know it's so strange you know how
[351.04 - 357.48] fibroids work I go yeah no I do they say
[353.92 - 360.44] well how come how come if you go looking
[357.48 - 362.88] into it what's the cause of Fire
[360.44 - 365.28] fibroids the answer isn't there there is
[362.88 - 367.36] no answer there is no answer a little
[365.28 - 369.60] bit of theory maybe some
[367.36 - 371.24] speculation I I I said well what do you
[369.60 - 374.16] mean it's like that with all chronic
[371.24 - 376.36] illness it's like yeah you're right yeah
[374.16 - 377.92] no of course I'm right it's like that
[376.36 - 380.36] with all chronic illness what what you
[377.92 - 382.04] kidding and even if there is a known
[380.36 - 384.72] cause to a chronic illness chances are
[382.04 - 388.64] it's totally wrong or planted that way
[384.72 - 392.08] Plant it wrong it's planted that way
[388.64 - 394.52] chronic illness is a weird weird thing
[392.08 - 397.16] for the industry they hate it it's like
[394.52 - 401.84] dirty laundry for the industries it's
[397.16 - 403.08] dirty laundry because it it truly shows
[401.84 - 404.72] it
[403.08 - 406.72] truly
[404.72 - 409.08] uncovers that the that the medical
[406.72 - 410.72] industry absolutely doesn't have their
[409.08 - 412.28] finger on the pulse of the people
[410.72 - 415.64] doesn't have their finger on the pulse
[412.28 - 418.12] of chronic illness on any level it just
[415.64 - 420.24] exposes tremendous amounts of medical
[418.12 - 422.40] denial and because of this it all gets
[420.24 - 423.84] funneled into the gene thing even the
[422.40 - 426.32] fibroid and the reason why I'm saying is
[423.84 - 429.04] is even the fibroid the whole thing with
[426.32 - 430.96] fibroids is oh it's hereditary oh it's
[429.04 - 433.36] it's genes no it's
[430.96 - 437.28] not it's not
[433.36 - 441.12] hereditary it's not Gene related once
[437.28 - 443.00] again insult insult insult women insult
[441.12 - 445.36] people insult people's intelligence
[443.00 - 448.92] insult people's beings and who they are
[445.36 - 451.64] just insult away just insult every
[448.92 - 454.08] second is what the industry does by
[451.64 - 457.08] doing that that's what they do when they
[454.08 - 458.92] do that it's horrendous no there's a
[457.08 - 460.24] real cause and you can have it your
[458.92 - 461.32] daughter can have it her daughter can
[460.24 - 462.76] have it their daughter can have it
[461.32 - 464.08] somebody else's daughter can have it
[462.76 - 465.92] somebody else's daughter can have it
[464.08 - 469.32] somebody else's mom can have it somebody
[465.92 - 470.68] it just goes right down the line because
[469.32 - 473.60] there's a real
[470.68 - 475.16] reason why everybody's got it going on
[473.60 - 477.76] there's a real reason why everybody has
[475.16 - 480.76] it so let's just you you know what just
[477.76 - 483.24] just just just treat people like they're
[480.76 - 486.44] dumb just treat them like they're dumb
[483.24 - 488.44] oh it's it's it's jeans let's just let's
[486.44 - 490.88] just keep doing that oh no we're going
[488.44 - 493.52] to put another 20 trillion dollar into
[490.88 - 495.48] jeans because it you can get suckered

[527.88 - 531.20] an
[528.96 - 533.72] insult it's a way to dumb down the
[531.20 - 536.28] people and then take tons and tons of
[533.72 - 538.80] money and mess with jeans in the
[536.28 - 540.92] industry in the back in the labs and
[538.80 - 543.92] then feed us some stuff that we do like
[540.92 - 546.20] to hear your DNA strand depend you know
[543.92 - 547.96] you can live longer if your DNA strand
[546.20 - 549.48] looks better and just look at all the
[547.96 - 551.44] trillions of dollars that went into our
[549.48 - 552.96] industry and we can give you some
[551.44 - 556.36] different things about
[552.96 - 558.52] jeans and okay yeah and if you have an
[556.36 - 560.56] if you have an illness or even even if

[570.28 - 576.24] but not in chronic illness and I'm
[573.04 - 578.16] saying all this because I just throw
[576.24 - 579.80] anything in the genan basket anything
[578.16 - 581.24] and they threw fibroids in the gene
[579.80 - 585.40] basket it's
[581.24 - 588.08] unbelievable it's disgusting it is
[585.40 - 591.64] because it's negligence to womenkind
[588.08 - 597.00] it's negligence to women it's
[591.64 - 598.72] negligence to humankind is what it is
[597.00 - 601.24] and that's what they do that's not the

[663.44 - 666.64] even know what's going on with my
[664.40 - 668.40] chronic illness thank you for doing what

[668.40 - 674.80] have towards doctors serious
[671.28 - 677.24] stuff but it's the industry the industry
[674.80 - 678.52] doesn't help the doctors the industry is
[677.24 - 681.28] not helping the doctors with Lyme
[678.52 - 683.20] disease at all they give them some bogus
[681.28 - 685.48] information from new fangled Labs that
[683.20 - 687.84] just got it all down think they got it
[685.48 - 689.44] all down doctor has no idea what's going
[687.84 - 691.16] on at the lab ever just gets the
[689.44 - 693.80] information says borderline you got
[691.16 - 696.08] borderline lime borderline wait a minute
[693.80 - 701.16] how can it be borderline it's either no
[696.08 - 702.84] or yay yay or nay when it comes down to
[701.16 - 704.88] if it's nay you still can have a
[702.84 - 707.44] pathogen if they can't find a pathogen
[704.88 - 709.12] you can still have one yes if they find
[707.44 - 710.48] a pathogen they found a pathogen you
[709.12 - 711.92] have a pathogen you could have a lot of
[710.48 - 713.48] different pathogens the point is you
[711.92 - 716.36] can't have
[713.48 - 718.20] borderline what a stupid mistake those
[716.36 - 719.32] labs made by doing that cuz you're not
[718.20 - 722.08] going to see that anymore any more
[719.32 - 724.16] that's a mistake by the way that's a
[722.08 - 726.08] mistake and you're not going to see that
[724.16 - 728.32] anymore because they don't want the gig
[726.08 - 730.40] to be up at the lime Labs you need to
[728.32 - 732.68] know that when it's the borderline thing
[730.40 - 734.52] that was a bad decision on their part
[732.68 - 735.72] you're going to see that disappear soon
[734.52 - 737.16] and it's never going to be borderline
[735.72 - 738.92] it's just going to be more and more yays
[737.16 - 740.32] yays yay yay more and more you have lime
[738.92 - 741.92] more and more you have lime out there
[740.32 - 744.40] and less borderline because the
[741.92 - 746.80] borderline shows something's wrong
[744.40 - 749.72] something's mischievously St stupidly
[746.80 - 751.88] wrong over there because
[749.72 - 754.36] you can't have borderline pathogen you
[751.88 - 756.12] either detect it you can't detect a
[754.36 - 758.80] little bit of the pathogen it means it's
[756.12 - 761.16] a yes if any bit of a pathogen's
[758.80 - 762.20] detected you can't have borderline and
[761.16 - 764.52] this is where it's said this what I'm
[762.20 - 767.04] saying the industry is screwing with the
[764.52 - 769.16] doctors in every way in every shape form
[767.04 - 770.60] and possible so doctors have don't have
[769.16 - 774.68] the right information don't know what's
[770.60 - 777.40] going on this is how it's done this is
[774.68 - 779.16] how it's done and the amount and and
[777.40 - 781.16] it's unbelievable when money's starts to
[779.16 - 783.44] file into this whole thing in all the
[781.16 - 785.20] different aspects of chronic illness it
[783.44 - 786.84] it becomes negligent and it leaves the
[785.20 - 789.84] person in the dark and it gets all
[786.84 - 791.48] thrown into jeans in the end yeah
[789.84 - 793.24] insulting people cuz people do have the
[791.48 - 794.96] same hair color as their mother they do
[793.24 - 796.88] have the same hair their noses are the
[794.96 - 798.68] same they do have the same lips they do
[796.88 - 801.20] have some same features around the chin
[798.68 - 803.04] bone structures so it's such an easy
[801.20 - 806.52] cell it's
[803.04 - 807.80] sick it really is so let's get down to
[806.52 - 809.64] Let's Get Down to the truth about
[807.80 - 812.72] fibroids I have to talk about this a
[809.64 - 815.48] little bit because if I don't then then
[812.72 - 818.00] you'll never know because if you never
[815.48 - 819.60] know then you might you might just go
[818.00 - 821.88] somewhere and say oh I'll listen to this
[819.60 - 825.08] other medical show from this other
[821.88 - 828.32] practitioner and then you know and and
[825.08 - 830.04] just not realize what's even going on
[828.32 - 831.64] you got to know that's the whole point
[830.04 - 833.84] of the show spirit said look we got to
[831.64 - 835.68] start doing things people got to know
[833.84 - 837.96] the truth I said all right I'm on it I'm
[835.68 - 840.24] on it I'm on it I'll shake shake out of
[837.96 - 842.80] it let me uh let me snap after let me
[840.24 - 844.40] wake up let me keep on going I'll keep
[842.80 - 846.48] on going Spirit what else do we have to
[844.40 - 851.44] do to get people the
[846.48 - 854.88] truth okay all right what's the cause of
[851.44 - 858.00] fibroids what is the cause what well the
[854.88 - 859.56] industry says oh done clear maybe it's
[858.00 - 862.72] estrogen
[859.56 - 864.84] maybe maybe maybe it's
[862.72 - 867.68] progesterone
[864.84 - 871.68] maybe maybe it's too much red
[867.68 - 874.76] meat that's also a concept in the
[871.68 - 876.12] industry too much red meat maybe it's
[874.76 - 878.40] too much
[876.12 - 880.24] alcohol you know
[878.40 - 884.24] maybe
[880.24 - 887.08] maybe red meats a trigger for something
[884.24 - 888.92] else because yeah a lot of red meat will
[887.08 - 892.28] probably guarantee some
[888.92 - 894.52] fibroids a lot of eggs will guaranteed
[892.28 - 897.28] fibroids for
[894.52 - 898.88] sure but why and the industry doesn't
[897.28 - 901.40] know that though they here's what it's
[898.88 - 903.92] really funny they'll put believe it or
[901.40 - 906.92] not the industry will
[903.92 - 908.84] actually give an uppercut or a low jab
[906.92 - 911.80] to red meat I mean they'll just punch
[908.84 - 913.80] the Sucker Punch red meat right in the
[911.80 - 915.32] stomach and they'll just say you know
[913.80 - 918.20] let's throw this one in and let's throw
[915.32 - 920.08] alcohol in you know we notice that women
[918.20 - 921.52] that eat a lot of red meat they tend to
[920.08 - 923.36] have a little bit more fibroids which
[921.52 - 926.40] we're kind of noticing let's really
[923.36 - 929.48] let's Sucker Punch that one but they
[926.40 - 932.04] will never sucker punch
[929.48 - 935.68] eggs they'll never sucker punch those
[932.04 - 937.24] darn eggs really interesting how it
[935.68 - 942.12] works
[937.24 - 944.80] eggs are the ultimate ultimate
[942.12 - 946.96] proliferating food for fibrates you want
[944.80 - 949.80] fibroids you eat eggs you don't want
[946.96 - 953.64] fibroids to go away you eat you eat
[949.80 - 955.00] eggs the ultimate ultimate fibid Creator
[953.64 - 957.28] it's the ultimate
[955.00 - 959.32] trigger the ultimate trigger could
[957.28 - 961.24] estrogen too much estrogen progesterone
[959.32 - 963.04] possibly create a
[961.24 - 966.48] fibroid
[963.04 - 968.00] yeah it could possibly feed a fibroid
[966.48 - 970.24] but why what's the cause it's not
[968.00 - 972.08] estrogen there's people out there that
[970.24 - 975.00] have so much estrogen they have tons of
[972.08 - 978.80] estrogen they eat a lot of red meat they
[975.00 - 981.08] drink a lot of alcohol they do things
[978.80 - 982.92] that would prompt fibroids but they
[981.08 - 984.60] never get the fibroids because you have
[982.92 - 987.36] to have something else in the body to
[984.60 - 991.12] feed to throw it estrogen to throw it
[987.36 - 992.36] progesterone to throw it red meat to
[991.12 - 996.80] throw
[992.36 - 998.80] it stuff right you have to have
[996.80 - 1000.52] something these are just triggers why do
[998.80 - 1004.32] you think you know it's the same thing
[1000.52 - 1007.64] with like the old guy that smoked for 60
[1004.32 - 1010.96] years he smoked for 60 years
[1007.64 - 1013.44] cigars you know stoies
[1010.96 - 1016.88] whatever those cancerous stoies you
[1013.44 - 1020.48] smoked him for 60 years he's 84 years
[1016.88 - 1022.56] old he eats a donut in the morning I I
[1020.48 - 1025.28] know guys like that by the
[1022.56 - 1027.72] way you know I know guys like that they
[1025.28 - 1031.84] get up they have a you know they have
[1027.72 - 1035.72] a whatever they have some canoli in the
[1031.84 - 1038.28] morning some canoli yeah seriously they
[1035.72 - 1040.44] have the croissant croissant or
[1038.28 - 1041.76] something in the morning I don't even
[1040.44 - 1043.56] know how you say croissant if someone
[1041.76 - 1047.40] said in a real French way recently I'm
[1043.56 - 1049.80] like wow that's pretty cool I'm not
[1047.40 - 1051.68] French and you know and the thing is is
[1049.80 - 1053.64] that and I like the way it sounded it
[1051.68 - 1055.36] made me want to go and get one made me
[1053.64 - 1057.68] want to go and get one and then I've
[1055.36 - 1059.68] heard somebody say cant they said
[1057.68 - 1061.00] croissant they go I had I said what did
[1059.68 - 1064.48] you eat today and they said I had a
[1061.00 - 1066.40] croissant I said what I said you know a
[1064.48 - 1068.00] croissant and it took me a while to
[1066.40 - 1070.32] figure it
[1068.00 - 1074.32] out people say it all kinds of different
[1070.32 - 1076.16] ways I love it I love it and you know um
[1074.32 - 1077.52] I've seen guys they eat that they'll eat
[1076.16 - 1079.16] that they'll eat anything they have that
[1077.52 - 1082.36] for breakfast they have a box of donuts
[1079.16 - 1084.84] for breakfast they're smoking like
[1082.36 - 1087.24] chimney you know the scotch we'll have a
[1084.84 - 1090.40] scotch whiskey later on that
[1087.24 - 1093.36] night and uh you know their lungs are
[1090.40 - 1096.16] filled with 60 years of smoke 70 years
[1093.36 - 1097.56] of smoke 70 years and they don't have
[1096.16 - 1099.12] lung cancer it's like why the hell do
[1097.56 - 1101.68] they don't have lung cancer I don't get
[1099.12 - 1103.48] because they needed something to feed to
[1101.68 - 1107.08] create the lung cancer they needed
[1103.48 - 1109.08] something inside of them to feed the
[1107.08 - 1110.36] lung cancer
[1109.08 - 1114.28] I and I've seen that with some women
[1110.36 - 1118.08] it's really rare and it's rare getting
[1114.28 - 1120.64] rare every day it's not like oh my God
[1118.08 - 1124.04] you know I found when I found Elder
[1120.64 - 1126.12] people in the old days I say you know
[1124.04 - 1128.84] when I'd go to like a a nursing home or
[1126.12 - 1130.20] something like that or or if I'd go
[1128.84 - 1133.24] somewhere you know there was just less
[1130.20 - 1134.96] older people in nursing homes things
[1133.24 - 1137.00] like that you know when I was younger I
[1134.96 - 1138.92] used to visit all those all the time you
[1137.00 - 1140.96] know I had clients and people be like
[1138.92 - 1143.60] look you have to come to the nursing
[1140.96 - 1145.28] home you have to see you know because
[1143.60 - 1148.80] nursing homes they won't they won't do
[1145.28 - 1150.88] anything for the people there meaning
[1148.80 - 1152.40] they won't take like natural B12 and
[1150.88 - 1155.68] give it to them they they they never do
[1152.40 - 1157.36] it the the the the the siblings have to
[1155.68 - 1158.76] really be involved like you have to be
[1157.36 - 1160.76] really be involved I remember so many
[1158.76 - 1162.08] times so many cases where they'd be like
[1160.76 - 1163.88] Anthony you got to come out here and you
[1162.08 - 1165.36] got to take a look at my my
[1163.88 - 1166.88] great-grandfather you have to my
[1165.36 - 1168.88] grandmother my great-grandfather you
[1166.88 - 1170.36] have to take a look I'd go out to a
[1168.88 - 1172.56] nursing home and I was like how come
[1170.36 - 1174.36] there's not that many old people here
[1172.56 - 1176.64] and the old people here that are here
[1174.36 - 1179.20] they're really really old and
[1176.64 - 1181.96] then that one decade goes by and they
[1179.20 - 1184.60] like whoa why are there a lot more
[1181.96 - 1186.68] younger people in here whoa another
[1184.60 - 1190.20] decade goes by oh my God that person's
[1186.68 - 1193.40] 45 years old and dying in the corner oh
[1190.20 - 1196.36] dear lord what that person's
[1193.40 - 1199.24] 38 and you go in there now into these
[1196.36 - 1201.64] places and it's unbelievable
[1199.24 - 1204.16] I mean you find them in their 20s
[1201.64 - 1206.68] wasting away with mystery disease and
[1204.16 - 1210.24] dying either in one of those places or
[1206.68 - 1213.60] at home or or whatever it's unbelievable
[1210.24 - 1215.36] and then and then it's crazy there's
[1213.60 - 1217.08] less old people there's less older
[1215.36 - 1218.08] people there's less older generation in
[1217.08 - 1221.76] these
[1218.08 - 1223.20] places they're all younger now you're
[1221.76 - 1224.92] going to tell me that's genes too that
[1223.20 - 1227.48] all happened in the last 30 years genes
[1224.92 - 1228.96] completely changed in the last 30 years
[1227.48 - 1230.96] and and all these young people are sick
[1228.96 - 1232.84] so so genes that have been going on for
[1230.96 - 1234.72] thousands of years since humankind going
[1232.84 - 1237.20] on for thousands of years since
[1234.72 - 1239.40] humankind thousands of years all of a
[1237.20 - 1242.80] sudden in the last 20 30 years genes
[1239.40 - 1245.28] changed completely just completely
[1242.80 - 1249.64] changed and then chronic illness
[1245.28 - 1251.60] exploded like no other no other yeah you
[1249.64 - 1253.72] watch TV everybody looks healthy on the
[1251.60 - 1256.72] TV besides there's a zillion cancer
[1253.72 - 1259.04] commercials now but if you you know but
[1256.72 - 1260.56] you look at TV you see all the actors
[1259.04 - 1262.64] they look healthy of course Spirit tells
[1260.56 - 1265.16] me they're not and many then I still see
[1262.64 - 1267.48] things in and out of it all if I watch
[1265.16 - 1269.48] TV but if you look at you look if you
[1267.48 - 1270.92] look on television because if I go over
[1269.48 - 1272.80] a family member's house and they got the
[1270.92 - 1275.20] television on and I I have to stand
[1272.80 - 1277.16] there I have to watch it and I'm like
[1275.20 - 1279.56] God it it everybody paints a picture
[1277.16 - 1281.00] like the whole world is healthy you
[1279.56 - 1282.56] wouldn't believe chronic illness has
[1281.00 - 1285.24] exploded hundreds of millions of people
[1282.56 - 1287.04] just in the us alone 200 million plus
[1285.24 - 1289.40] Americans got
[1287.04 - 1291.40] problems but it's not genes it couldn't
[1289.40 - 1294.48] happen in it couldn't happened in 20
[1291.40 - 1298.04] years that's the insult
[1294.48 - 1299.80] insulting so things have changed and
[1298.04 - 1302.40] everything and fibbr are now they're on
[1299.80 - 1305.64] the rise like never before and remember
[1302.40 - 1309.40] earlier on it wasn't like that but
[1305.64 - 1313.52] they're on the rise the whole fibroid
[1309.40 - 1316.00] thing so there's triggers for fibroids
[1313.52 - 1317.52] and that's what the industry kind of
[1316.00 - 1319.08] doesn't want to really say they just
[1317.52 - 1321.36] don't even know the C they try to make
[1319.08 - 1322.92] it cause the trigger as cause that's a
[1321.36 - 1324.04] mistake you know in the Hashimoto
[1322.92 - 1327.36] thyroid
[1324.04 - 1329.12] book I don't do trigger as cause I know
[1327.36 - 1331.72] the cause I put the cause in the thyroid
[1329.12 - 1334.04] healing book I do the triggers
[1331.72 - 1337.52] separately you go into somebody else's
[1334.04 - 1339.36] thyroid stuff and you check into it they
[1337.52 - 1342.64] have the trigger as
[1339.36 - 1345.04] cause completely backwards like
[1342.64 - 1346.64] Antiquity it's unbelievable here we are
[1345.04 - 1349.80] what year is it and they still don't
[1346.64 - 1352.44] know come on come on it's
[1349.80 - 1354.64] unbelievable so that red meat the
[1352.44 - 1356.92] alcohol gets thrown in gets thrown in as
[1354.64 - 1358.80] hey this is this is what's creating the
[1356.92 - 1360.28] fibroids throw estrogen in it too that's
[1358.80 - 1364.48] what's creating the
[1360.28 - 1367.24] fibroids it's not fibroids are a virus
[1364.48 - 1370.52] it's a small virus virus I talk about
[1367.24 - 1374.00] day in day out fibroid virus is Epstein
[1370.52 - 1375.60] bar it's in everybody and if you feed it
[1374.00 - 1378.16] just right it's going to come out and
[1375.60 - 1380.96] it's going to create some stuff and and
[1378.16 - 1383.36] it creates a fbid a growth a
[1380.96 - 1385.52] growth can create a lot of growths and
[1383.36 - 1387.76] it could create some and just you know
[1385.52 - 1391.44] and and what does it love to feed on it
[1387.76 - 1393.44] loves to feed on certain things lots of
[1391.44 - 1395.80] things dairy products why isn't dairy
[1393.44 - 1398.40] products in there as a trigger
[1395.80 - 1399.68] whoa because for some reason you know
[1398.40 - 1402.20] you just don't want to not you don't
[1399.68 - 1405.08] want to Sucker Punch the yogurt
[1402.20 - 1406.72] industry you just don't because yogurt
[1405.08 - 1407.96] are yogurt's supposed to be healthy for
[1406.72 - 1409.28] women it's one of those things that
[1407.96 - 1411.64] lines up and it's supposed to be healthy
[1409.28 - 1414.56] for women it's disastrous for women
[1411.64 - 1417.24] yogurt is the worst thing for Women's
[1414.56 - 1420.08] Health you don't believe me fine nothing
[1417.24 - 1421.44] I can do then you don't believe me you
[1420.08 - 1423.04] know you could be brand new to the show
[1421.44 - 1424.92] and you're like oh god the guy thinks
[1423.04 - 1427.64] yogurt's bad for you unbelievable all
[1424.92 - 1428.76] that natural you know acidophilus and
[1427.64 - 1433.32] everything else he doesn't even know
[1428.76 - 1437.60] what he's talking about no I do I do
[1433.32 - 1440.56] yogurt feeds see yogurt feeds the virus
[1437.60 - 1441.88] up bar the variety that causes fibroids
[1440.56 - 1444.44] the variety that goes to the
[1441.88 - 1447.28] reproductive system that causes
[1444.44 - 1449.92] fibroids and yogurt feeds
[1447.28 - 1451.68] it if it didn't I wouldn't be picking on
[1449.92 - 1453.44] it if it didn't I wouldn't be picking on
[1451.68 - 1456.68] it why would I pick on
[1453.44 - 1459.88] it Scott why would I pick on
[1456.68 - 1462.00] it you know but it feeds but here's what
[1459.88 - 1465.84] the industry does it
[1462.00 - 1467.88] protects certain items and it makes sure
[1465.84 - 1469.76] that women eat more of those items oh
[1467.88 - 1471.76] got to get my calcium I got to have my
[1469.76 - 1473.16] milk I got to have my dairy products I
[1471.76 - 1475.80] have to have my calcium I need my
[1473.16 - 1478.04] protein for my cheese and as a woman the
[1475.80 - 1480.12] industry tricks you and it's like no no
[1478.04 - 1482.16] here's a little snack pack you open up
[1480.12 - 1484.40] your snack pack and I got my nuts which
[1482.16 - 1486.88] is okay I got my cheese
[1484.40 - 1488.24] squares all right and I got my little
[1486.88 - 1491.52] ham
[1488.24 - 1495.80] pieces it's protein it's perfect for a
[1491.52 - 1498.24] woman on the go it's absurd and they do
[1495.80 - 1499.96] this purposely so that you never learn
[1498.24 - 1501.44] so you get a fibroid and they do it so
[1499.96 - 1502.88] that your daughter gets a fibroid they
[1501.44 - 1505.12] do it so that your daughter's daughter
[1502.88 - 1508.04] gets a fibroid also keeps the industry
[1505.12 - 1511.16] happy keeps the industry fat and happy
[1508.04 - 1513.76] boy that's why that's there that's why
[1511.16 - 1516.20] that's there they protect those cheese
[1513.76 - 1518.96] squares they they Sucker Punch red meat
[1516.20 - 1520.92] cuz red meat doesn't really cause
[1518.96 - 1523.12] fibroids to to to a degree it's just
[1520.92 - 1524.56] that red meat red meat eaters usually
[1523.12 - 1525.92] also like cheese and crackers they also
[1524.56 - 1527.40] a lot of like cheese they like a lot of
[1525.92 - 1529.36] eggs they you know that kind of stuff
[1527.40 - 1532.96] they won't pick on those for a
[1529.36 - 1535.72] reason remember agenda I said it in the
[1532.96 - 1537.36] beginning you know also somebody of the
[1535.72 - 1539.68] other day said you know you got this new
[1537.36 - 1541.12] beginning I don't like it in your show I
[1539.68 - 1542.60] hate it there's a new beginning in your
[1541.12 - 1543.88] show and I've known you for a while
[1542.60 - 1545.24] Anthony and there's this new beginning
[1543.88 - 1546.36] you talk about all these groups blah
[1545.24 - 1548.52] blah blah and the
[1546.36 - 1550.24] information I go too bad if you don't
[1548.52 - 1553.08] like it it has to be there I have no
[1550.24 - 1556.48] choice because spirit I had a talk with
[1553.08 - 1558.16] spirit and spirit tells me that people
[1556.48 - 1559.72] just think you can get this information
[1558.16 - 1561.88] anywhere else all the people the new
[1559.72 - 1563.44] people that come to the show and and and
[1561.88 - 1565.00] they don't know the other information
[1563.44 - 1566.48] how it's contaminated and spirit doesn't
[1565.00 - 1567.84] like being affiliate affiliated with
[1566.48 - 1569.68] contaminated information that's on the
[1567.84 - 1571.68] internet and both Natural Health and
[1569.68 - 1575.32] conventional health and I I have to I
[1571.68 - 1577.48] have to honor that so it is what it is
[1575.32 - 1579.88] but those agenda groups they protect
[1577.48 - 1583.08] those little cheese squares they're
[1579.88 - 1586.60] protected so you get fibroids
[1583.08 - 1588.48] more so you get more fibroids and you're
[1586.60 - 1590.08] thinking well who's protecting it my
[1588.48 - 1592.36] doctor isn't no your doctor isn't your
[1590.08 - 1596.76] doctor's good it's all good but there's
[1592.36 - 1598.44] private panel of influencers private
[1596.76 - 1601.20] panel of think
[1598.44 - 1603.68] tankers that you couldn't believe
[1601.20 - 1606.12] exist you have no
[1603.68 - 1607.92] idea they protect those cheese squares
[1606.12 - 1611.32] they protect eggs in fact when you got
[1607.92 - 1613.96] PCOS what's the most recommended food
[1611.32 - 1616.48] for the body for a woman's body when you
[1613.96 - 1619.00] got PCOS which is also Epstein bar
[1616.48 - 1620.48] caused and people with PCOS usually have
[1619.00 - 1621.96] uterine fibroids too and they usually
[1620.48 - 1623.52] get them at some point they have the
[1621.96 - 1625.68] they have the cysts and they have the
[1623.52 - 1628.72] the fibroids and they have the cysts and
[1625.68 - 1629.96] what's what's you know what's the number

[1641.76 - 1647.68] cheese oh some nuts that's good it's
[1645.00 - 1651.64] unbelievable they oh little bacon slices
[1647.68 - 1653.92] not bacon slices little ham slices and
[1651.64 - 1657.92] hey I'm passionate about this topic with
[1653.92 - 1660.52] fibroids because I can't stand people
[1657.92 - 1663.28] getting taken advantage of women getting
[1660.52 - 1665.92] taken advantage of that's my sore spot
[1663.28 - 1668.08] right there that's my sour spot because
[1665.92 - 1670.24] I've I've dedicated my life to womenkind
[1668.08 - 1672.24] where I've seen chronic illness and it's
[1670.24 - 1675.76] been the majority of the people who have
[1672.24 - 1678.92] come to me for decades since I was young
[1675.76 - 1683.04] starting with my grandmother and it
[1678.92 - 1685.48] hurts it hurts it hurts and without
[1683.04 - 1687.48] womenkind you can't nothing gets done
[1685.48 - 1690.16] right because I don't care what anybody
[1687.48 - 1692.12] says women are still smarter than men I
[1690.16 - 1694.96] mean you know you know men are great too
[1692.12 - 1697.64] men are men men are smart too men are
[1694.96 - 1700.84] smart too I know that and Men Are Great
[1697.64 - 1703.76] too you need men for men are important
[1700.84 - 1706.92] too I know they're just as important I
[1703.76 - 1709.16] just say this because I get red up
[1706.92 - 1712.92] because of seen a lot of H things happen
[1709.16 - 1715.84] in chronic illness but um I've helped
[1712.92 - 1717.72] helped out a lot of men in my lifetime
[1715.84 - 1719.48] and uh there's some great people out
[1717.72 - 1722.40] there both women and men in the world
[1719.48 - 1724.92] and salt of the earth and you can't you
[1722.40 - 1728.84] can't touch that the salt of the earth
[1724.92 - 1730.60] so here's the deal here's the deal we
[1728.84 - 1733.00] got to watch out with the foods because
[1730.60 - 1735.08] the foods play a massive
[1733.00 - 1736.92] role because they're the trigger to an
[1735.08 - 1738.32] Epstein bar virus that kind of goes into
[1736.92 - 1740.16] the reprodu productive system that kind
[1738.32 - 1742.72] of gets into that reproductive system
[1740.16 - 1745.52] and causes some
[1742.72 - 1747.84] trouble and we have to be really mindful
[1745.52 - 1749.72] about that we have to be on that it's
[1747.84 - 1751.16] important first of all we got to do
[1749.72 - 1752.60] things and knock down the Epstein bar
[1751.16 - 1754.96] virus that got into the reproductive
[1752.60 - 1757.04] system and that EP bar virus causes
[1754.96 - 1759.56] pregnancy complications all the time for
[1757.04 - 1761.12] women all the time this isn't just
[1759.56 - 1763.84] pelvic inflammatory disease which is
[1761.12 - 1765.80] strepa cacus Strep cacus which is you
[1763.84 - 1767.48] know antibiotic resistant strep cacus
[1765.80 - 1768.56] that gets into the reproductive system
[1767.48 - 1769.96] and causes a lot of different
[1768.56 - 1771.60] inflammation in different areas and
[1769.96 - 1773.60] that's
[1771.60 - 1776.24] PID yeah because there's so many
[1773.60 - 1778.32] different varieties of strep and you can
[1776.24 - 1781.80] pick up strep anyhow it's just it's easy
[1778.32 - 1783.68] to pick up but but the deal is and
[1781.80 - 1786.68] people have it they have strep in them
[1783.68 - 1789.44] but the Epstein bar is the that's makes
[1786.68 - 1791.16] that that growth which kind of like a
[1789.44 - 1795.16] smooth piece of
[1791.16 - 1797.00] muscle Mak can get big real big so what
[1795.16 - 1797.96] we got to do is we got to knock those
[1797.00 - 1799.84] down
[1797.96 - 1801.48] we got to you know there's there was I
[1799.84 - 1805.48] remember this one case I think it was in
[1801.48 - 1807.92] 2000 so it was uh what 17 years ago and
[1805.48 - 1810.72] um she wanted to do things natural she
[1807.92 - 1814.16] was suffering a lot of bleeding um the
[1810.72 - 1817.20] doctors said that that it was it was
[1814.16 - 1819.92] bigger than a small great fruit the
[1817.20 - 1822.28] fibroid the uterine fibroid and it was
[1819.92 - 1823.72] causing tremendous amount of pain and
[1822.28 - 1825.96] they just said look hysterctomy
[1823.72 - 1829.04] hysterectomy and I understand I
[1825.96 - 1830.40] understand you know I understand when um
[1829.04 - 1832.00] when doctors they feel they have no
[1830.40 - 1833.88] choice and you know and there's certain
[1832.00 - 1835.72] situations and circumstances where you
[1833.88 - 1837.88] have to do hysterctomy I I you know what
[1835.72 - 1839.28] women have had gone through and there's
[1837.88 - 1840.68] reasons for that and there's a lot of
[1839.28 - 1843.60] things that happen and
[1840.68 - 1846.20] occur and you know we we try to avoid if
[1843.60 - 1848.36] we can naturally in any way possible or
[1846.20 - 1851.00] even conventionally in any way possible
[1848.36 - 1852.88] absolutely but in in some cases you you
[1851.00 - 1857.40] just can't avoid it and it's it it can
[1852.88 - 1859.00] happen totally totally and and uh so so
[1857.40 - 1861.32] this this woman she had a serious she
[1859.00 - 1863.36] had a serious fibroid it was just it was
[1861.32 - 1865.20] agonizing and she said well what can we
[1863.36 - 1866.76] do about it I'm desperate I'm desperate
[1865.20 - 1868.40] I said well we can do something about it
[1866.76 - 1871.12] let's change your diet let's overhaul it
[1868.40 - 1872.40] let's overhaul it to such a degree we're
[1871.12 - 1873.80] talking about the whole bit we're going
[1872.40 - 1875.28] to do every green juice we're going to
[1873.80 - 1876.44] do all the fruits just fruits and green
[1875.28 - 1877.96] juice you're going to live on for a
[1876.44 - 1879.48] while it's not your permanent diet you
[1877.96 - 1880.88] can go back to the foods you like and
[1879.48 - 1884.08] different kinds of foods except for the
[1880.88 - 1885.56] ones that create create a fibroid and I
[1884.08 - 1887.80] said you know we we just have to with
[1885.56 - 1889.00] fruits and green juices and she was like
[1887.80 - 1890.32] that's going to be hard to do but I'm
[1889.00 - 1892.68] going to try it she did the fruits and
[1890.32 - 1895.32] green juices meaning got enough calories
[1892.68 - 1896.96] lots of bananas banana smoothies banana
[1895.32 - 1898.68] smoothies and celery banana smoothies
[1896.96 - 1900.52] and celery lots of different veggies
[1898.68 - 1904.24] lots of leafy greens but lots of bananas
[1900.52 - 1906.96] lots of different fruits bananas being a
[1904.24 - 1909.28] staple and it was it was not it's not an
[1906.96 - 1912.24] easy diet it's not but she didn't have a
[1909.28 - 1914.76] lot of options she was bleeding and not
[1912.24 - 1918.20] just bleeding very
[1914.76 - 1920.52] seriously but I mean she was suffering
[1918.20 - 1922.04] suffering and they they had this they
[1920.52 - 1924.96] had this fibroid
[1922.04 - 1929.32] measured they had it measured and they
[1924.96 - 1932.88] were watching it and she did this for 30
[1929.32 - 1935.16] days she went back they couldn't find
[1932.88 - 1939.00] it it was
[1935.16 - 1941.72] gone baffled they were baffled I mean
[1939.00 - 1943.28] when I mean baffled I mean baffled they
[1941.72 - 1946.24] were scratching their head they were
[1943.28 - 1949.60] confounded to such a degree baffled they
[1946.24 - 1951.76] were so confused it just made no sense
[1949.60 - 1954.00] they asked her did you go for surgery
[1951.76 - 1956.00] somewhere we can't we just this doesn't

[2114.08 - 2118.36] to be fed there's different varieties
[2116.44 - 2120.24] and they're like different varieties of
[2118.36 - 2121.88] Epstein bar people still do that now
[2120.24 - 2124.60] they're like different
[2121.88 - 2127.44] varieties I go yeah there's different
[2124.60 - 2129.24] varieties I go and some are more docile
[2127.44 - 2130.48] some just are just fibroid causers some
[2129.24 - 2131.96] don't really do much they give you a
[2130.48 - 2133.76] little mono sometimes you get a mono you
[2131.96 - 2135.40] don't even know you had Mono and then
[2133.76 - 2136.76] later on you get fibroids down the road
[2135.40 - 2138.24] and so forth and if you're eating and
[2136.76 - 2140.72] drinking or doing things that are bad
[2138.24 - 2142.84] like you're triggering it or you're
[2140.72 - 2144.28] under severe emotional stress and she
[2142.84 - 2145.32] was under a tremendous amount of
[2144.28 - 2147.76] emotional
[2145.32 - 2149.80] stress and now I think about it's 9 17
[2147.76 - 2151.24] years ago I think this is 19 years ago
[2149.80 - 2154.44] 19 years
[2151.24 - 2155.80] ago that's what this is it's about 19
[2154.44 - 2159.04] years
[2155.80 - 2160.88] ago the time's flying so fast I'm just
[2159.04 - 2165.48] I'm baffled by the way time flies
[2160.88 - 2166.92] actually so it's close to 19 years I
[2165.48 - 2169.80] think it was
[2166.92 - 2173.32] 98 99 I think it's
[2169.80 - 2175.32] 98 and you know they were so confused so
[2173.32 - 2176.84] confused and I was explaining the whole
[2175.32 - 2179.12] thing about Epstein bar how it works
[2176.84 - 2181.44] what it's doing how it feeds how it eats
[2179.12 - 2183.20] How It Grow the muscle the smooth muscle
[2181.44 - 2185.72] the growth how it works underneath where
[2183.20 - 2189.00] the virus is located all of
[2185.72 - 2190.88] this and now you better not eat eggs and
[2189.00 - 2192.84] she was being she was eating a lot of
[2190.88 - 2194.16] eggs she was eating two eggs a day to
[2192.84 - 2196.12] get her protein she was putting them
[2194.16 - 2197.48] hardboiled on her salad and then she was
[2196.12 - 2198.76] just having them in the morning too
[2197.48 - 2200.44] sometimes she' do three eggs sometimes
[2198.76 - 2202.48] she three four eggs a day recommended by
[2200.44 - 2204.68] the doctors they said eggs she needs her
[2202.48 - 2206.32] Protein that's the whole point I said oh
[2204.68 - 2209.04] dear lord we're back to that again and
[2206.32 - 2211.60] here we are 19 years later you still
[2209.04 - 2213.88] hear the same mumble jumble they protein
[2211.60 - 2215.40] protein oh my God eggs are the best food
[2213.88 - 2218.48] it's like nothing changed it's why
[2215.40 - 2220.32] Spirit also changed my My Life by saying
[2218.48 - 2222.52] okay you're leaving the office for now
[2220.32 - 2223.88] you buy office spirit said we can't I
[2222.52 - 2225.44] said no I don't want to leave the office
[2223.88 - 2227.00] said spirit said no you got to put this
[2225.44 - 2228.32] out on books you got to put this out on
[2227.00 - 2231.20] the radio you got to do what you got to
[2228.32 - 2233.56] do this is just it's not getting
[2231.20 - 2236.16] better so the idea is we got to knock
[2233.56 - 2239.12] down the upsteam bar but what we can do
[2236.16 - 2243.16] is not just do that we we take away the
[2239.12 - 2245.92] triggers it's great it's great remove
[2243.16 - 2247.48] triggers no eggs ever no dairy products
[2245.92 - 2249.16] ever
[2247.48 - 2251.52] lower the amount of red meat cuz red
[2249.16 - 2253.72] meat's so filled with adrenaline that
[2251.52 - 2257.00] that could trigger it a little
[2253.72 - 2259.56] bit and if you're under a lot of stress
[2257.00 - 2263.28] the the the uh adrenals pump out so much
[2259.56 - 2264.60] different so much in complex hormones
[2263.28 - 2265.88] when you're under fear or stress or
[2264.60 - 2267.36] anxiety or anything else like that in
[2265.88 - 2269.00] your life or any kind of problems that
[2267.36 - 2271.24] could feed the virus and create a
[2269.00 - 2272.16] fibroid so we have to try to de-stress a
[2271.24 - 2274.44] little bit we have to DEC
[2272.16 - 2275.88] compartmentalize if we even have to we
[2274.44 - 2278.08] have to you go to the beach we have to
[2275.88 - 2279.84] say waves they're crashing on the beach
[2278.08 - 2282.28] that's what I'm seeing I'm not I'm not
[2279.84 - 2283.60] seeing I'm not seeing the divorce I went
[2282.28 - 2285.60] through I'm not seeing you know the
[2283.60 - 2288.04] problems I got at work I'm not seeing
[2285.60 - 2290.56] this and that I'm not just I see waves I
[2288.04 - 2292.12] see I see clouds you got to you got to
[2290.56 - 2294.76] you got to get the stress levels down so
[2292.12 - 2297.36] there's adrenals calm down a little bit
[2294.76 - 2298.84] it's all part of stopping fibroids and
[2297.36 - 2300.64] younger women they get the fibroids
[2298.84 - 2302.40] absolutely because they got the Epstein
[2300.64 - 2304.52] bar early of course you get the Epstein
[2302.40 - 2306.00] bar really early you're 14 years old
[2304.52 - 2308.08] once those hormones start kicking in
[2306.00 - 2310.32] they can feed the Epstein bar once
[2308.08 - 2312.44] anything kicks in stress responsibility
[2310.32 - 2314.28] you know there's there's there's I mean
[2312.44 - 2316.20] young women that that they have to all
[2314.28 - 2317.88] of a sudden go middle middle school to
[2316.20 - 2319.52] high school and that that alone is just
[2317.88 - 2322.92] a tremendous amount of stress they get
[2319.52 - 2325.24] mono you name it high school um High
[2322.92 - 2327.32] School you're 18 19 years old you got to
[2325.24 - 2329.44] go to college and that alone is really
[2327.32 - 2331.00] stressful you get mono in college mono
[2329.44 - 2332.48] becomes a problem you get a fibroid by
[2331.00 - 2334.48] the time you're 29 years old you get a
[2332.48 - 2336.72] little bit of you get a little bit of um
[2334.48 - 2338.24] PCOS possibly developing your doctor is
[2336.72 - 2340.36] like okay you got to go on the pill the
[2338.24 - 2343.76] pill itself is problematic too a lot
[2340.36 - 2345.68] because the pill can stimulate a fibroid
[2343.76 - 2347.76] because the pill can aggravate Epstein
[2345.68 - 2350.92] bar feed Epstein bar so that's something
[2347.76 - 2353.04] too that's that's a concern but we do
[2350.92 - 2355.04] the best we can so what I'd say as you
[2353.04 - 2357.44] work with diet you knock things down
[2355.04 - 2360.84] lots of fruit fruit is incredible for
[2357.44 - 2364.12] the uterus the uterus and fruit go hand
[2360.84 - 2367.52] in hand the uterus creates a fruit it
[2364.12 - 2369.96] creates a fruit it create it it that's
[2367.52 - 2374.44] the whole point it grows a
[2369.96 - 2376.92] child it's like a pod that grows a
[2374.44 - 2379.40] child it grows a
[2376.92 - 2381.64] baby that's the
[2379.40 - 2385.76] fruit that is the
[2381.64 - 2387.24] fruit I mean that's fruit is so critical
[2385.76 - 2390.72] so
[2387.24 - 2393.16] important it goes hand in hand with the
[2390.72 - 2394.12] woman's reproductive system so to take
[2393.16 - 2397.00] out
[2394.12 - 2399.92] fruit for some you know
[2397.00 - 2402.36] terrible lame reason in the
[2399.92 - 2403.60] industries is it's just something you
[2402.36 - 2406.00] don't want to
[2403.60 - 2408.56] do but oh yeah that's right they put a
[2406.00 - 2410.72] little bit of fruit and yogurt they do
[2408.56 - 2414.36] there's the sarcasm again I can't help
[2410.72 - 2416.08] it I can't help it so one thing and I
[2414.36 - 2418.00] told you I I told you there is the
[2416.08 - 2420.40] sarcasm in there because of the passion
[2418.00 - 2422.68] because I I feel bad too and but the
[2420.40 - 2424.60] sarcasm I can't help it a little bit of
[2422.68 - 2426.44] that comes out I said to spe a long time
[2424.60 - 2427.92] ago I said look you can't change me
[2426.44 - 2430.96] though I remember I was a kid and I was
[2427.92 - 2432.32] sarc I was a sarcastic little kid and
[2430.96 - 2434.60] spirit said look I don't expect to
[2432.32 - 2436.88] change you I just need you to stay
[2434.60 - 2439.36] alive that's what spirit said I need you
[2436.88 - 2442.52] to stay alive just stay alive and just
[2439.36 - 2444.52] and just and work for me for the people
[2442.52 - 2446.16] I said I guess I can do that but you're
[2444.52 - 2447.60] not going to change who I am I said to
[2446.16 - 2449.92] Spirit you're not going to make me more
[2447.60 - 2451.48] spiritual I'm not going to put a gown on
[2449.92 - 2454.40] and and walk around in a gown I'm not
[2451.48 - 2455.84] going to be all more spiritual I'm not
[2454.40 - 2457.48] going to have flowers in my hair I mean
[2455.84 - 2458.80] I love that I think it's really cool I
[2457.48 - 2460.32] got a friend that looks like that all
[2458.80 - 2462.92] the time and I think it's really cool
[2460.32 - 2465.56] but I can't do that I can't have my
[2462.92 - 2467.12] hands together 24/7 in the prayer mode
[2465.56 - 2469.92] and stuff and the prayer posst I can't
[2467.12 - 2472.08] do that all the time I am extremely
[2469.92 - 2473.32] spiritual but I like it my friends do it
[2472.08 - 2475.12] because you know they I don't know they
[2473.32 - 2477.48] look so cool I don't look
[2475.12 - 2479.60] cool then you know if you if you look
[2477.48 - 2481.56] cool doing it then then that's that's
[2479.60 - 2484.88] awesome because I always say God you
[2481.56 - 2486.64] look so cool I love it like you look so
[2484.88 - 2488.36] cool they're like well you can do it too
[2486.64 - 2490.88] you can look really cool you can totally
[2488.36 - 2494.52] look like spiritual L and I go no I look
[2490.88 - 2496.84] like a geek look like a geek look at my
[2494.52 - 2499.36] photo like I'm a geek and you know and
[2496.84 - 2500.88] the thing is is that a sarcastic like I
[2499.36 - 2502.36] guess a little geek and you know and I
[2500.88 - 2504.16] said Spirit you can't change me I'm not
[2502.36 - 2506.08] going to go more spiritual in a way
[2504.16 - 2508.68] where I look more spiritual I'm going to
[2506.08 - 2510.84] be sarcastic and spirit said it's okay
[2508.68 - 2512.48] doesn't matter doesn't matter we love
[2510.84 - 2514.40] you who you are we just need you to stay
[2512.48 - 2516.20] alive and get the information out little
[2514.40 - 2517.52] bit by little come on I said all right
[2516.20 - 2519.28] all right all right I'll do it I had a
[2517.52 - 2521.52] struggle with with that actually the
[2519.28 - 2523.44] time I got into the early teens and mid
[2521.52 - 2525.56] teens I was like I can't take this
[2523.44 - 2526.92] anymore everybody else is having fun and
[2525.56 - 2531.24] doing what they want to do and I got to
[2526.92 - 2533.56] hear Spirit 24/7 247 about fibroids but
[2531.24 - 2535.20] then I realize it's the most important
[2533.56 - 2536.72] thing in the world is making sure we get
[2535.20 - 2540.20] fibroids better than women that's the
[2536.72 - 2542.12] whole point that's the I mean women in
[2540.20 - 2545.16] reproductive systems to keep the human
[2542.12 - 2546.76] race going keep us strong keep women
[2545.16 - 2550.24] strong
[2546.76 - 2554.08] because they mean so much in our
[2550.24 - 2555.56] lives my God going back in history all
[2554.08 - 2558.28] the way to the
[2555.56 - 2562.24] beginning and it's the most important
[2558.28 - 2564.40] thing in the world and so um it matters
[2562.24 - 2566.16] it matters herbs raspberry leaf
[2564.40 - 2568.16] incredible for knocking down fibroids
[2566.16 - 2570.44] because it does level out the hormones a
[2568.16 - 2574.44] little bit hormones that feed EP steam
[2570.44 - 2576.56] bar estrogens a woman's estrogen is not
[2574.44 - 2578.68] necessarily the estrogen that feeds the
[2576.56 - 2580.12] the Epstein bar virus creating a fibroid
[2578.68 - 2583.84] so
[2580.12 - 2586.52] much it's it what it is it's estrogens
[2583.84 - 2589.08] that are in Foods estrogens in eggs
[2586.52 - 2591.52] estrogens in Dairy estrogens in yeah red
[2589.08 - 2594.00] meat little bit in there estrogens in
[2591.52 - 2596.44] all kinds of different things though
[2594.00 - 2599.40] estrogens and Plastics estrogens and
[2596.44 - 2601.32] solvents medications you name it it's
[2599.40 - 2603.08] unbelievable and and those are the
[2601.32 - 2604.56] estrogens that that that need to get
[2603.08 - 2605.80] eliminated and pushed out of the body
[2604.56 - 2607.80] and they collect they build up in the
[2605.80 - 2610.56] liver the liver has the liver and the
[2607.80 - 2613.64] uterus are like they're married together
[2610.56 - 2616.04] they're married together the
[2613.64 - 2619.96] liver it's like the
[2616.04 - 2621.64] husband the uterus is like the wife
[2619.96 - 2624.96] seriously
[2621.64 - 2628.28] seriously the liver gets all toxic it's
[2624.96 - 2631.12] all toxic and all filled with
[2628.28 - 2632.96] crap no I see where this is going I
[2631.12 - 2635.52] don't think this is going in a good
[2632.96 - 2636.88] place the liver gets all toxic and it
[2635.52 - 2641.44] gets all fil filled with crab and
[2636.88 - 2644.60] everything right and then and then you
[2641.44 - 2646.32] know and that's a problem because you
[2644.60 - 2647.92] know the epscene bar sits in the liver
[2646.32 - 2649.88] and it's you know doing its thing it's
[2647.92 - 2651.88] not just that all the poisons all the
[2649.88 - 2655.12] estrogens are trapped in the liver the
[2651.88 - 2658.04] liver traps all the estrogens the liver
[2655.12 - 2659.56] is cleaning up all this stuff and and
[2658.04 - 2662.04] and has all this
[2659.56 - 2664.40] stuff and you know and that's not good a
[2662.04 - 2667.84] clean liver helps out a clean liver
[2664.40 - 2672.68] helps a uterus get better
[2667.84 - 2675.44] a clean husband helps a wife get
[2672.68 - 2677.48] better you know and so it they're like
[2675.44 - 2680.56] hand in hand the estrogens get all
[2677.48 - 2682.16] trapped in the liver the liver holds a
[2680.56 - 2683.96] lot of different bad estrogens cuz
[2682.16 - 2686.16] trying to protect you but they they the
[2683.96 - 2687.80] liver gets so clogged up because of say
[2686.16 - 2689.24] red meat too much red meat or too much
[2687.80 - 2692.68] eggs or whatever it is too they get
[2689.24 - 2694.36] clogged up fried greasy food whatever
[2692.68 - 2695.96] and it's not good the estrogens they get
[2694.36 - 2697.12] they have to get released they get
[2695.96 - 2700.56] release but they don't get out of the
[2697.12 - 2703.16] body in time reproductive system takes
[2700.56 - 2705.84] takes it I mean it gets saturated a
[2703.16 - 2708.44] little bit feeds the Epstein bar
[2705.84 - 2710.48] raspberry leaf is great incredible

[3086.04 - 3089.56] and you know it's
[3087.60 - 3092.72] important but these are some of the
[3089.56 - 3096.32] basics to get started on if you do the
[3092.72 - 3098.80] foods you have something in your hand
[3096.32 - 3100.04] really powerful ashwag Ganda is a good
[3098.80 - 3102.80] one too

[3106.52 - 3113.32] uh w a g n dhaa DHA I think that's the
[3111.08 - 3115.24] uh the spelling if I could remember
[3113.32 - 3116.84] ashwag is a great one too little bit of
[3115.24 - 3119.28] that that goes a long way for with
[3116.84 - 3123.84] fibroids it is helpful so that's another
[3119.28 - 3126.64] good one and um but in the food realm
[3123.84 - 3129.24] all fruits of all kinds cherries really
[3126.64 - 3131.60] help with fibroids cherries cranberries
[3129.24 - 3135.24] really help with fibroids cranberries
[3131.60 - 3137.92] right right all of these are helpful and
[3135.24 - 3139.88] then any vegetable is helpful you know
[3137.92 - 3141.96] all vegetables are helpful sparus work
[3139.88 - 3144.64] really good with fibroids too I've had
[3141.96 - 3146.60] great great relief you know with
[3144.64 - 3150.04] fibroids with women over the years
[3146.60 - 3151.68] spirit Spirit would say juice asparagus
[3150.04 - 3154.72] juice
[3151.68 - 3156.24] asparagus and you know in the days when
[3154.72 - 3158.52] people didn't even know you could juice
[3156.24 - 3160.64] asparagus be like juice asparagus they
[3158.52 - 3162.76] would juice it every single day raw
[3160.64 - 3163.56] asparagus juice it and the fibroids
[3162.76 - 3165.52] would
[3163.56 - 3168.40] reduce they would
[3165.52 - 3171.24] reduce we can take
[3168.40 - 3172.16] control we can take control and do what
[3171.24 - 3174.36] we need to
[3172.16 - 3176.12] do so see these are some of the things
[3174.36 - 3177.52] to consider
[3176.12 - 3178.96] and once you know what creates your
[3177.52 - 3180.76] fibroids you only get stronger I'm going
[3178.96 - 3183.20] to tell you that right now once you know
[3180.76 - 3185.16] what creates your fibroids you only get
[3183.20 - 3188.20] stronger Epstein bar weakens when you
[3185.16 - 3189.44] know the truth which makes me upset
[3188.20 - 3191.88] about the
[3189.44 - 3193.56] industries they either don't know about
[3191.88 - 3195.48] Epstein bar with all the different
[3193.56 - 3198.40] things that spirit and I know or if they
[3195.48 - 3201.32] do know God help
[3198.40 - 3203.04] them meaning God help them because
[3201.32 - 3204.76] they're messing up bad by not letting
[3203.04 - 3207.08] anybody know what what's the real cause
[3204.76 - 3212.12] of anything thing if they do
[3207.08 - 3213.88] know and you know seriously it's sad and
[3212.12 - 3216.28] because when you do know what causes
[3213.88 - 3218.28] something you get stronger your immune
[3216.28 - 3219.68] system goes after the very thing that
[3218.28 - 3221.44] causes a fibroid when you know what's
[3219.68 - 3223.00] going on when you know what's wrong it's
[3221.44 - 3224.96] half the battle I say it every time I
[3223.00 - 3226.76] got to say that one more time half the
[3224.96 - 3228.44] battle of healing is knowing what's
[3226.76 - 3233.48] wrong what's the other half what's the
[3228.44 - 3236.40] other half knowing what to do knowing
[3233.48 - 3240.12] what to do
[3236.40 - 3242.40] okay and also remember that I love you
