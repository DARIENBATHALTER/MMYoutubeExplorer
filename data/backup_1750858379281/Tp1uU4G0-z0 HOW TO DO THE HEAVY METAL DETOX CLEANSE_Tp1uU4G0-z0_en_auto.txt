[339.60 - 345.12] i got the atlantic dulce right here the
[342.64 - 346.32] whole form here it is that's the whole
[345.12 - 348.40] form right
[346.32 - 350.88] we need the cilantro we need the dose
[348.40 - 352.88] that's the dose liquid
[350.88 - 355.12] we need the spirulina
[352.88 - 357.36] spirulina powder we have to have the
[355.12 - 359.36] spirulina powder
[357.36 - 360.96] so that's the next one right there do
[359.36 - 362.88] you have the spirulina powder that's the
[360.96 - 365.28] vimer21 that's the one i trust i'm not
[362.88 - 366.72] sponsored but these guys are incredible
[365.28 - 370.08] it's the best one out there do you have
[366.72 - 373.04] the barley grass juice powder broken
[370.08 - 375.12] record coming broken record coming not
[373.04 - 378.48] barley grass
[375.12 - 380.24] barley grass juice powder
[378.48 - 382.16] last night when i went to bed last night
[380.24 - 384.72] right
[382.16 - 386.32] like literally even after working on on
[384.72 - 388.40] the book i was working on proofing the
[386.32 - 390.00] book i was doing some proofs on the book
[388.40 - 392.48] because the books getting closer and
[390.00 - 394.40] closer right to getting out
[392.48 - 396.56] and i went to bed last night
[394.40 - 397.44] and all i saw was
[396.56 - 399.12] like
[397.44 - 401.84] barley grass
[399.12 - 404.56] don't do barley grass juice powder don't
[401.84 - 406.16] do barley grass barley gras like that's
[404.56 - 407.28] how many times i think i said it
[406.16 - 410.08] yesterday
[407.28 - 412.88] it's got to be barley grass juice powder
[410.08 - 414.72] not barley grass you can't get metals
[412.88 - 416.16] out with the barley grass it's not going
[414.72 - 417.44] to happen it has to be the juice powder
[416.16 - 418.48] because the juice pattern i'll just tell
[417.44 - 419.92] you
[418.48 - 423.20] travels
[419.92 - 425.12] the juice powder it actually absorbs
[423.20 - 426.88] assimilates
[425.12 - 429.12] that's what it does it gets into the
[426.88 - 430.80] bloodstream it travels to the brain it
[429.12 - 433.36] travels to the nervous system it has to
[430.80 - 435.68] be the juice powder these are the
[433.36 - 437.76] differences these are the details that
[435.68 - 439.28] matter in order to heal
[437.76 - 441.68] if you don't believe you have metals but
[439.28 - 444.00] you're suffering with anxiety
[441.68 - 445.92] we still got to have it right
[444.00 - 448.16] so we can get the metals out even if you
[445.92 - 450.64] don't believe it's a metal causing it in
[448.16 - 453.04] order to get better the details have to
[450.64 - 455.68] matter they have to be right so we got
[453.04 - 459.68] the barley grass cheese powder right
[455.68 - 462.72] and then last but not least we need the
[459.68 - 465.36] wild blueberries right here
[462.72 - 467.36] is it the frozen wild blueberries okay
[465.36 - 468.96] that's one option right there you can do
[467.36 - 470.64] the wild blueberry juice which i'm gonna
[468.96 - 471.84] grab a wild blueberry juice in a minute
[470.64 - 473.28] too
[471.84 - 475.60] so we need that
[473.28 - 476.96] so we need a wild blueberry juice and
[475.60 - 478.88] then
[476.96 - 480.48] we got the
[478.88 - 482.40] we got and if you got a wild blueberry
[480.48 - 484.88] powder that's great too
[482.40 - 488.32] that's great right i'm looking around i
[484.88 - 488.32] can't find my wild blueberry juice
[488.80 - 493.84] all right so i'm gonna have to just go
[490.80 - 493.84] get it
[496.88 - 500.40] so we got the wild blueberry juice right
[498.56 - 502.56] here
[500.40 - 505.12] so that's the wyman's one all right so
[502.56 - 507.92] that's an option there so the five key
[505.12 - 510.56] ingredients is critical it's critical
[507.92 - 513.36] it's cilantro it's spirulina it's barley
[510.56 - 514.96] grass juice powder it's dulse
[513.36 - 516.80] and it's
[514.96 - 520.96] the wild blueberries right
[516.80 - 525.04] now here's how it works
[520.96 - 527.20] when you have all five key ingredients
[525.04 - 530.00] you can get the metals from deeper
[527.20 - 532.88] places out of the body
[530.00 - 534.64] and you can get them completely out of
[532.88 - 537.76] the body
[534.64 - 539.84] and then when you do the cleanse
[537.76 - 542.24] you're really taking it to that next
[539.84 - 545.20] level to get the metals out of the body
[542.24 - 547.12] because when you're doing the cleanse
[545.20 - 548.80] you're not eating any fats in the
[547.12 - 551.76] morning to block
[548.80 - 554.00] to block the metals from coming out
[551.76 - 555.68] you're not eating any fats to block the
[554.00 - 558.32] metals from coming out we're still
[555.68 - 559.68] censored on facebook big time you guys
[558.32 - 561.28] so we're not that's what happens when
[559.68 - 564.24] you don't do
[561.28 - 566.64] the fats in the morning you don't block
[564.24 - 568.16] the metals from coming out
[566.64 - 570.00] so that's what's key about it right
[568.16 - 571.36] there so if you're not doing bacon
[570.00 - 573.28] you're not doing eggs you're not doing
[571.36 - 574.40] nut butters you're not doing oils you're
[573.28 - 575.84] not doing
[574.40 - 577.20] you know whatever you're not doing
[575.84 - 578.32] chicken in the morning a lot of people
[577.20 - 579.60] eat they're not doing cheese in the
[578.32 - 581.76] morning you're not doing milk in the
[579.60 - 583.04] morning milk butter eggs cheese
[581.76 - 585.28] kefir
[583.04 - 587.52] sour cream you're not doing any kind of
[585.28 - 589.28] fat in the morning
[587.52 - 590.80] cottage cheese whatever you're not doing
[589.28 - 592.96] any kind of fat in the morning when you
[590.80 - 595.84] hold those off and you don't do fats in
[592.96 - 599.36] the morning you can get the metals out
[595.84 - 601.52] if you're doing the actual metal remover
[599.36 - 603.12] stuff you got the heavy metal detox
[601.52 - 605.20] smoothie you got that going on like you
[603.12 - 606.24] got your cilantro your your spirulina
[605.20 - 607.84] broadly grass juice powder your wild
[606.24 - 610.96] blueberries the whole bit the dolls you
[607.84 - 612.72] do that and you're not doing any metals
[610.96 - 614.64] i mean sir you're not doing any fats you
[612.72 - 616.56] can get the metals out of the
[614.64 - 618.96] bloodstream
[616.56 - 620.48] so the reason why the heavy metal detox
[618.96 - 622.08] cleanse
[620.48 - 626.00] right
[622.08 - 627.20] doesn't have any fats in the morning
[626.00 - 631.60] it's so
[627.20 - 632.40] the metals don't stay in the bloodstream
[631.60 - 634.88] and then
[632.40 - 638.08] go back into your liver
[634.88 - 640.80] or go back into your brain or go back
[638.08 - 642.32] into something
[640.80 - 644.64] that's how it works that's what's
[642.32 - 647.44] amazing about it right so we're in the
[644.64 - 649.04] cleanse right now we're day one
[647.44 - 650.32] so let's talk about what we have to do

[709.12 - 715.20] here's how here's how easy it is
[712.16 - 717.68] do not do hot water
[715.20 - 720.32] you want to do hot water
[717.68 - 723.20] you just lost
[720.32 - 725.36] boom you don't win
[723.20 - 728.08] yes you can do lemon in hot tea but
[725.36 - 729.84] that's not going to give you the flush
[728.08 - 732.24] that's not going to help hydrate you and
[729.84 - 735.20] give you the flush
[732.24 - 737.28] when you cook your lemon
[735.20 - 739.12] in hot water like
[737.28 - 740.40] hot lemon tea
[739.12 - 742.48] right
[740.40 - 744.56] you don't get a flush
[742.48 - 747.68] it doesn't hydrate either it doesn't
[744.56 - 750.32] have that hydration power
[747.68 - 752.40] this is really important to know
[750.32 - 755.28] okay so that's what i did i just put
[752.40 - 756.72] fresh lemon juice right into this cup
[755.28 - 757.84] just like that
[756.72 - 759.44] okay
[757.84 - 761.04] amazing
[759.44 - 763.84] now i'm going to add some water look at
[761.04 - 766.64] this you can have lukewarm water you can
[763.84 - 769.68] have room temperature water you can have
[766.64 - 769.68] cold water
[769.84 - 777.04] you don't want hot water
[773.52 - 779.68] keep that in mind right so there you go
[777.04 - 782.96] lemon water right there
[779.68 - 784.72] voila all set that fast
[782.96 - 786.56] so when you think about how hard is this
[784.72 - 788.56] cleanse like how hard is it to do like
[786.56 - 790.80] what what do i have to do for this
[788.56 - 792.32] because i'm not i'm not into anything
[790.80 - 794.16] hard to do
[792.32 - 796.56] yep k says i'm seeing you on facebook
[794.16 - 798.16] yes of course there's a few people on
[796.56 - 800.16] there it's just that they're holding
[798.16 - 802.56] back the other you know few thousand
[800.16 - 802.56] easy
[803.28 - 807.60] so why not hot water the question comes
[805.52 - 809.84] through why not hot water
[807.60 - 811.44] the reason why hot water doesn't work is
[809.84 - 813.04] because you kill the phytochemical
[811.44 - 814.48] compounds the living water because
[813.04 - 815.84] that's what it is
[814.48 - 818.48] you kill it
[815.84 - 820.56] and that's important to know right there
[818.48 - 823.68] so
[820.56 - 825.60] if you're if you're using hot water
[823.68 - 829.04] you lose that
[825.60 - 830.48] flushing agent that's in it right so
[829.04 - 832.08] here's how it works
[830.48 - 836.40] a lemon
[832.08 - 838.48] is not boiling hot on the tree
[836.40 - 840.96] so when the lemon's on the tree it's not
[838.48 - 843.12] boiling hot you don't go to the lemon
[840.96 - 846.64] tree and you pick up pick a lemon you're
[843.12 - 850.64] like oh oh my god so hot oh my god it's
[846.64 - 852.64] hot well whoa whoa it's hot whoa
[850.64 - 853.44] you don't do that
[852.64 - 855.12] so
[853.44 - 856.72] you grab it
[855.12 - 858.88] a lot of times especially when the
[856.72 - 860.80] lemons are actually on the lemon tree
[858.88 - 862.32] it's cool out too
[860.80 - 864.40] it's cool
[862.32 - 866.48] it's around that time of the year where
[864.40 - 869.60] it's cool okay
[866.48 - 872.48] so when you you have living water
[869.60 - 875.44] living enzymes living water
[872.48 - 878.00] phytochemical compounds that are alive
[875.44 - 881.04] in that lemon you don't want to cook
[878.00 - 883.20] them you cook them you change it
[881.04 - 886.08] is what you do
[883.20 - 888.48] you change it if you cook them
[886.08 - 891.12] they don't flush
[888.48 - 894.00] it becomes something different
[891.12 - 895.60] so that's important to know right
[894.00 - 896.48] so
[895.60 - 898.40] um
[896.48 - 899.92] if you're sensitive if you got teeth
[898.40 - 903.20] that are sensitive
[899.92 - 905.92] can't handle cold water on your teeth
[903.20 - 907.84] right then do lukewarm warm temp like
[905.92 - 909.28] you don't like room temp or anything
[907.84 - 911.60] like that okay
[909.28 - 913.20] if you get sensitive teeth from lemon
[911.60 - 914.88] water
[913.20 - 916.24] from you think the lemon if the lemon
[914.88 - 917.60] that's not the lemon giving you
[916.24 - 919.84] sensitive teeth that just means you have
[917.60 - 922.48] sensitive nerves
[919.84 - 924.24] that means you have sensitive nerves
[922.48 - 928.32] so keep that in mind
[924.24 - 931.92] the calcium in lemon restores the teeth
[928.32 - 934.00] is what it does it restores enamel
[931.92 - 934.80] you know that's what it does
[934.00 - 936.88] like
[934.80 - 939.04] lemon will showcase you have a problem
[936.88 - 941.36] but it doesn't create a problem that's
[939.04 - 944.32] important to know so lemon does not
[941.36 - 946.00] create a problem
[944.32 - 948.88] it just showcases that you have
[946.00 - 951.60] sensitivities you have inflammation in
[948.88 - 954.40] your jaw inflammation in your teeth
[951.60 - 956.48] inflammation in your gums
[954.40 - 960.24] right that's what it could do but lemon
[956.48 - 963.12] itself kills pathogens in the mouth
[960.24 - 965.92] and around the gum line
[963.12 - 969.12] keeping you from getting cavities
[965.92 - 970.80] keeping you from these kinds of things
[969.12 - 973.84] so that's that's what happens there so
[970.80 - 976.64] i'm just letting you know okay
[973.84 - 978.56] so lemon water is the first thing
[976.64 - 980.00] right we're going into
[978.56 - 981.36] and then we'll do before we go into
[980.00 - 983.92] anything else we're going to talk about
[981.36 - 986.48] other stuff right here
[983.92 - 989.68] so when it comes down to symptoms a lot
[986.48 - 991.68] of people have anxiety they have panic
[989.68 - 993.60] they have heart palpitations they have
[991.68 - 994.96] racing heart
[993.60 - 997.04] a lot of people are struggling
[994.96 - 999.60] struggling with all of that a lot of
[997.04 - 1000.88] people have that diagnosis of bipolar a
[999.60 - 1003.36] lot of people
[1000.88 - 1005.28] are up and down that's what the bipolar
[1003.36 - 1006.96] diagnosis means it doesn't give you a
[1005.28 - 1008.72] real answer it just says well that
[1006.96 - 1010.56] person's always either manic or that
[1008.72 - 1012.16] person's just depressed
[1010.56 - 1014.24] so eventually they get it they get a
[1012.16 - 1016.00] bipolar diagnosis
[1014.24 - 1017.60] power of compassion says when i started
[1016.00 - 1019.04] medical medium i used to have very
[1017.60 - 1020.88] sensitive teeth
[1019.04 - 1022.64] after drinking lemon water now i don't
[1020.88 - 1024.96] feel anything i love lemon water power
[1022.64 - 1026.56] compassion because you're because you're
[1024.96 - 1028.00] doing medical medium
[1026.56 - 1029.60] and medical being protocols you're
[1028.00 - 1032.72] restoring your nerves
[1029.60 - 1034.48] you're strengthening your nerves
[1032.72 - 1036.80] that's why so you're strengthening your
[1034.48 - 1038.48] central nervous system so everything
[1036.80 - 1039.84] strengthens your entire
[1038.48 - 1042.00] central nervous system that's what's
[1039.84 - 1043.76] incredible about that
[1042.00 - 1045.52] sandy says celery juice it helped
[1043.76 - 1048.16] restore my gums
[1045.52 - 1050.56] it does despite what people who don't
[1048.16 - 1052.24] drink celery juice say they don't drink
[1050.56 - 1053.44] it out there they just they're naysayers
[1052.24 - 1055.44] because they want to just destroy
[1053.44 - 1056.96] anybody's chance of healing
[1055.44 - 1058.88] so they'll say hey
[1056.96 - 1061.04] you know don't drink celery juice i
[1058.88 - 1062.48] heard it's bad for you it's like okay
[1061.04 - 1064.00] that's great you just ruined a chance
[1062.48 - 1066.24] for somebody to heal their gums like
[1064.00 - 1067.36] sandy so thank god you you're actually
[1066.24 - 1069.44] you're listening you're drinking your
[1067.36 - 1072.72] celery juice you heal your gums that
[1069.44 - 1075.60] that's amazing that's incredible
[1072.72 - 1077.92] so our central nervous system can get
[1075.60 - 1079.68] inflamed easy
[1077.92 - 1083.12] pathogens inflame our central nervous
[1079.68 - 1085.84] system metals have a big role in it too
[1083.12 - 1087.36] but metals do other things too metals
[1085.84 - 1088.72] get into
[1087.36 - 1091.04] the brain
[1088.72 - 1093.92] is what they do
[1091.04 - 1095.36] eventually a lot of people though
[1093.92 - 1096.96] they'll like bang their head in their
[1095.36 - 1098.08] car door
[1096.96 - 1100.24] they go
[1098.08 - 1103.12] to the hospital
[1100.24 - 1104.96] they get an mri on their head
[1103.12 - 1107.28] to make sure they're okay
[1104.96 - 1108.56] and then the doctor says i see something
[1107.28 - 1110.48] on there
[1108.56 - 1114.08] but we don't know what it is but we see
[1110.48 - 1117.84] something we see gray area we see
[1114.08 - 1119.84] a dark spot we see something there
[1117.84 - 1121.36] people don't realize
[1119.84 - 1124.24] okay that
[1121.36 - 1127.60] a lot of times toxic heavy metals create
[1124.24 - 1130.00] these oxidative places in the brain like
[1127.60 - 1131.36] dark spots little different spots in our
[1130.00 - 1134.00] brain
[1131.36 - 1135.92] okay so we get these marks inside our
[1134.00 - 1137.76] brain so there's millions of people
[1135.92 - 1139.76] around the world that eventually when
[1137.76 - 1142.08] they get an mri they have these little
[1139.76 - 1143.76] you have these little dots that show up
[1142.08 - 1145.84] a lot of times it won't even show up but
[1143.76 - 1148.08] they'll have these dots that show up
[1145.84 - 1150.40] right they'll show up somewhere in the
[1148.08 - 1151.68] brain anywhere little black spots and
[1150.40 - 1153.52] stuff like that
[1151.68 - 1155.28] so metals tend to hide in a lot of
[1153.52 - 1157.04] places right
[1155.28 - 1158.64] adhd
[1157.04 - 1160.32] autism
[1158.64 - 1162.40] metals go right here i'll show you on a
[1160.32 - 1165.44] close-up on that right there metals go
[1162.40 - 1168.16] right here midline canal right there
[1165.44 - 1169.92] so adhd autism
[1168.16 - 1171.60] right there it is
[1169.92 - 1173.60] right in between the left and right
[1171.60 - 1175.76] hemisphere
[1173.60 - 1178.56] on tic toc you guys i we're doing a
[1175.76 - 1181.12] camera close up over here so i know you
[1178.56 - 1182.88] guys can't see it but that midline canal
[1181.12 - 1185.52] right here
[1182.88 - 1187.20] that's where the metal settle
[1185.52 - 1189.44] when you're a child
[1187.20 - 1191.04] they settle in the midline canal
[1189.44 - 1192.80] so
[1191.04 - 1196.24] so when when um
[1192.80 - 1198.72] moms and dads are giving their children
[1196.24 - 1200.72] the heavy metal detox smoothie they're
[1198.72 - 1203.12] seeing progress
[1200.72 - 1206.16] because the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1203.12 - 1208.00] is removing metals out of the midline
[1206.16 - 1210.32] canal
[1208.00 - 1211.92] and so progress is occurring
[1210.32 - 1214.88] because we're getting metals so with
[1211.92 - 1218.24] autism and adhd the metals that gather
[1214.88 - 1220.32] in the midline canal right here
[1218.24 - 1223.04] they interfere with information
[1220.32 - 1225.12] traveling back and forth from the left
[1223.04 - 1227.44] and right hemisphere i wrote about that
[1225.12 - 1230.08] in the medical medium books
[1227.44 - 1231.28] so there's information that travels back
[1230.08 - 1233.20] and forth
[1231.28 - 1235.36] and when that canal is filled up with
[1233.20 - 1237.36] metal right here so the information goes
[1235.36 - 1239.04] back and forth to left and right
[1237.36 - 1240.24] hemisphere
[1239.04 - 1243.60] so
[1240.24 - 1246.88] when that is filled up with mercury
[1243.60 - 1249.92] when that's filled up with aluminum
[1246.88 - 1251.84] information doesn't travel across easily
[1249.92 - 1253.92] and so you end up with the autism
[1251.84 - 1256.72] diagnosis you end up with all the
[1253.92 - 1259.20] symptoms you end up with the severe adhd
[1256.72 - 1260.24] that's the metals in the midline canal
[1259.20 - 1261.92] okay
[1260.24 - 1263.20] now here's the thing a lot of people
[1261.92 - 1265.28] have metals
[1263.20 - 1267.28] sprinkled about
[1265.28 - 1269.84] and that ends it ends up adding up as
[1267.28 - 1272.40] the years go on and we get the brain fog
[1269.84 - 1274.24] so how many people have brain fog
[1272.40 - 1276.00] or how many people had brain fog i know
[1274.24 - 1277.20] a lot of people using medical medium
[1276.00 - 1280.00] information
[1277.20 - 1282.72] and and brain fog proto uh protocols for
[1280.00 - 1283.84] brain fog they actually fix it
[1282.72 - 1286.56] right
[1283.84 - 1288.72] so miriam says my teeth bled in every
[1286.56 - 1290.88] pregnancy but not this one means you're
[1288.72 - 1292.96] getting stronger getting healthier
[1290.88 - 1295.12] incredible
[1292.96 - 1297.12] so with brain fog you can have metal
[1295.12 - 1298.48] sprinkled about
[1297.12 - 1300.16] so you're wondering like where do i get
[1298.48 - 1301.84] mercury and all these metals if word is
[1300.16 - 1303.68] like where does it where does it come
[1301.84 - 1306.32] from well i notice a lot of people like
[1303.68 - 1308.72] tattoos these days
[1306.32 - 1311.44] a lot of people like ink these days
[1308.72 - 1314.40] and i'm not against getting ink at all
[1311.44 - 1316.24] if you got ink don't get it removed
[1314.40 - 1318.80] you know i mean if you have ink it's
[1316.24 - 1321.44] fine that's fine but what people don't
[1318.80 - 1323.28] realize is that's a huge one for toxic
[1321.44 - 1325.60] heavy metals that's why the heavy metal
[1323.28 - 1327.68] detox cleanse is so important
[1325.60 - 1330.00] that's why the heavy metal detox
[1327.68 - 1333.12] smoothie is so important because what
[1330.00 - 1334.24] happens is that this tattoo's really
[1333.12 - 1336.00] cool too
[1334.24 - 1338.08] this tattoo says germany this is really
[1336.00 - 1338.96] cool
[1338.08 - 1340.40] so
[1338.96 - 1342.96] you got the skull on there a lot of
[1340.40 - 1345.28] people get skulls on their arms
[1342.96 - 1346.64] a lot of people get skulls on their arms
[1345.28 - 1347.68] i'm going to get a close-up on this
[1346.64 - 1349.28] right
[1347.68 - 1350.96] well
[1349.28 - 1353.04] a lot of people seem that cool this is
[1350.96 - 1355.60] germany isn't that cool
[1353.04 - 1357.76] we got a lot of german uh uh
[1355.60 - 1359.60] uh fans and followers and that do the
[1357.76 - 1363.12] medical mean protocols anyway
[1359.60 - 1364.88] i thought i'd put this one on for today
[1363.12 - 1366.96] a lot of people get roses
[1364.88 - 1368.72] right it's like plant a rose garden a
[1366.96 - 1370.72] lot of people get roses
[1368.72 - 1372.08] so there's nothing wrong with getting
[1370.72 - 1374.88] tattoos
[1372.08 - 1375.84] it's just that there's no heavy metal
[1374.88 - 1377.12] free
[1375.84 - 1378.80] ink
[1377.12 - 1380.64] so when you get when someone's like hey
[1378.80 - 1382.56] i know this great tattoo parlor i know
[1380.64 - 1385.04] this great tattoo artist
[1382.56 - 1388.40] they use cruelty free
[1385.04 - 1390.32] ink they use animal cruelty free ink
[1388.40 - 1392.48] it's vegan
[1390.32 - 1395.04] it's vegan ink
[1392.48 - 1397.36] it's filled with metal you can't have it
[1395.04 - 1399.52] any other way and i'll tell you why
[1397.36 - 1401.36] when you get your ink
[1399.52 - 1403.04] right and i'll show you this right here
[1401.36 - 1405.36] you see this rose you can see this rose
[1403.04 - 1408.40] up close
[1405.36 - 1410.56] the reason why you can see the rose on
[1408.40 - 1412.08] your arm when you get the ink or you get
[1410.56 - 1414.08] on your wherever you got your tattoo
[1412.08 - 1416.56] maybe you just got an excrep inscription
[1414.08 - 1418.16] maybe you just got some wise words
[1416.56 - 1420.24] you know like some wise words written
[1418.16 - 1422.08] across maybe you got like
[1420.24 - 1423.60] you know the name of of something
[1422.08 - 1425.12] written somewhere whatever it is that
[1423.60 - 1428.32] you choose to get
[1425.12 - 1429.44] you see the rose it pops when light hits
[1428.32 - 1431.52] it right
[1429.44 - 1433.92] when it's in your arm and the only way
[1431.52 - 1435.28] that can happen is if that ink is filled
[1433.92 - 1438.64] with metal
[1435.28 - 1441.60] that's the reflective nature of the ink
[1438.64 - 1444.00] so what happens is when light goes into
[1441.60 - 1445.92] your derma
[1444.00 - 1448.24] anything like any kind of light not
[1445.92 - 1451.20] sunlight any kind of light goes through
[1448.24 - 1454.00] your derma it hits the ink and it
[1451.20 - 1457.12] reflects back out
[1454.00 - 1459.04] that's how you get that pop
[1457.12 - 1460.40] so when you walk out of the tattoo
[1459.04 - 1463.36] parlor
[1460.40 - 1464.88] and the dude there or whoever gave you a
[1463.36 - 1468.00] tattoo
[1464.88 - 1469.92] they said it was animal cruelty free ink
[1468.00 - 1472.64] maybe it was animal cruelty free free
[1469.92 - 1474.32] ink but it's not heavy metal free ink
[1472.64 - 1476.48] because the metals
[1474.32 - 1479.28] make it so you can see it
[1476.48 - 1482.00] and so here's how it works as the metals
[1479.28 - 1483.68] go into your bloodstream every day from
[1482.00 - 1485.68] there on out
[1483.68 - 1487.92] and they go to your brain over time as
[1485.68 - 1490.88] the metals travel into your bloodstream
[1487.92 - 1491.68] and get to your brain over time
[1490.88 - 1494.96] okay
[1491.68 - 1497.60] your your tattoo fades it's not fading
[1494.96 - 1499.84] because you're getting older
[1497.60 - 1504.00] it's not fading because you've had the
[1499.84 - 1506.80] tattoo for 10 years or 15 years 20 years
[1504.00 - 1509.28] it's fading because all the metal is
[1506.80 - 1510.40] slowly leaving through your derma that
[1509.28 - 1512.84] pass through your derm into your
[1510.40 - 1515.84] bloodstream and ends up in your
[1512.84 - 1517.68] liver and ends up in your brain
[1515.84 - 1519.60] that's where it's going
[1517.68 - 1520.80] right and it's not about getting them
[1519.60 - 1522.56] removed
[1520.80 - 1526.00] it's about just being proactive and
[1522.56 - 1528.64] catching the metals as they're leaving
[1526.00 - 1531.60] i always tell people who are inked up
[1528.64 - 1534.00] heavy metal detox smoothie for life man
[1531.60 - 1535.20] heavy metal detox smoothie for life
[1534.00 - 1537.92] because what you're gonna do is you're
[1535.20 - 1540.00] gonna be catching the metals as they're
[1537.92 - 1542.08] going to the brain you're gonna be
[1540.00 - 1544.80] catching them
[1542.08 - 1546.96] arena park says mm tools have healed my
[1544.80 - 1548.96] really bad teeth and gum sensitivities i
[1546.96 - 1551.68] no longer have nerve pain in my cavity
[1548.96 - 1553.36] that's incredible on youtube amazing
[1551.68 - 1554.88] amazing
[1553.36 - 1556.00] so what happened the other day i think
[1554.88 - 1557.52] it was not the other day but like a
[1556.00 - 1559.12] month ago or something i mentioned about
[1557.52 - 1560.64] tattoos and someone was like i gotta get
[1559.12 - 1562.00] them all removed just like no you don't
[1560.64 - 1564.56] have to get them all removed you just
[1562.00 - 1566.48] gotta be proactive and catch the metal
[1564.56 - 1567.84] as it's going into the
[1566.48 - 1570.08] stream they're like okay i'm gonna get
[1567.84 - 1572.56] more tattoos then now i'm gonna get more
[1570.08 - 1574.48] tattoos you don't have to do that either
[1572.56 - 1576.00] you don't have to get more tattoos i
[1574.48 - 1579.04] know it's addictive but you don't have
[1576.00 - 1581.04] to get more more tattoos right
[1579.04 - 1582.48] but the point is the bottom line is i'm
[1581.04 - 1584.80] just saying you guys
[1582.48 - 1587.12] that if anybody has any ink
[1584.80 - 1588.64] that metal and some ink is way worse
[1587.12 - 1590.80] than others for sure but either way
[1588.64 - 1591.84] they're all packed with metal that's how
[1590.80 - 1592.80] you see
[1591.84 - 1593.84] the
[1592.80 - 1595.28] picture
[1593.84 - 1597.36] you see the picture because you're
[1595.28 - 1600.32] watching light
[1597.36 - 1602.24] hit the metal and reflect back out
[1600.32 - 1604.72] through your skin
[1602.24 - 1606.40] that's how you see the picture that's
[1604.72 - 1609.28] how it's done
[1606.40 - 1611.20] lots of metals so the bottom line is
[1609.28 - 1613.52] where do we get metals
[1611.20 - 1614.48] that's one place right there
[1613.52 - 1616.56] one

[1688.96 - 1692.08] all right let's talk about teeth a
[1690.32 - 1694.88] little bit a lot of people come to
[1692.08 - 1696.72] medical medium information brand new off
[1694.88 - 1699.36] the press and their teeth are about to
[1696.72 - 1699.36] fall apart
[1699.52 - 1704.32] their teeth are about to fall apart
[1702.08 - 1706.96] they're coming into
[1704.32 - 1708.88] the medical meeting community
[1706.96 - 1712.00] they get a book
[1708.88 - 1714.40] they're starting their first process
[1712.00 - 1716.72] but their teeth are time capsules that
[1714.40 - 1718.88] are about to all fall apart
[1716.72 - 1720.64] you know what i'm saying you guys
[1718.88 - 1722.08] they've already screwed up throughout
[1720.64 - 1723.52] their life
[1722.08 - 1726.00] it's not their fault they just didn't
[1723.52 - 1727.68] know they already did too much caffeine
[1726.00 - 1731.36] for too many years which
[1727.68 - 1732.88] eats your teeth from the inside out
[1731.36 - 1734.24] and i'm not picking on anybody drink
[1732.88 - 1735.52] caffeine or whatever i'm not that's not
[1734.24 - 1737.44] where we're going today but i'm saying
[1735.52 - 1738.40] they already did vinegar years of
[1737.44 - 1740.56] vinegar
[1738.40 - 1741.44] they've already done years of vinegar
[1740.56 - 1742.80] okay
[1741.44 - 1745.44] for years
[1742.80 - 1746.56] okay they've already done lots of dairy
[1745.44 - 1747.92] products
[1746.56 - 1750.08] they've already
[1747.92 - 1751.68] created an acidic environment in their
[1750.08 - 1754.08] life
[1751.68 - 1756.24] they've already done these things right
[1754.08 - 1759.28] they've already eaten all this msg and
[1756.24 - 1761.52] nutritional yeast and everything else
[1759.28 - 1763.92] they've they've already done all this
[1761.52 - 1766.64] charcoal and made themselves deficient
[1763.92 - 1768.80] because charcoal actually clogs up your
[1766.64 - 1770.72] highways and your intestinal tract so
[1768.80 - 1772.56] that you don't get any nutrients so you
[1770.72 - 1774.16] essentially get nutrient deficient when
[1772.56 - 1776.48] you eat charcoal
[1774.16 - 1778.40] right they did all these things and then
[1776.48 - 1781.20] they come into the medical medium
[1778.40 - 1783.68] community with time capsules that are
[1781.20 - 1785.36] about to freaking explode
[1783.68 - 1788.56] they're about to need a lot of dental
[1785.36 - 1790.00] work in a year or six months
[1788.56 - 1791.36] they come into the medical medium
[1790.00 - 1794.16] community
[1791.36 - 1796.00] literally like time capsules of all the
[1794.16 - 1797.68] crap they did before
[1796.00 - 1801.12] they come in
[1797.68 - 1805.52] and their teeth start falling apart
[1801.12 - 1808.00] and they're like ever since ever since
[1805.52 - 1810.24] i did the medical medium lemon water my
[1808.00 - 1812.16] teeth are all falling apart ever since i
[1810.24 - 1814.40] did the medical medium celery juice my
[1812.16 - 1816.08] teeth are falling apart i started eating
[1814.40 - 1818.32] celery sticks for the first time in my
[1816.08 - 1820.16] life and my teeth started falling apart
[1818.32 - 1822.80] i did the spiruline and my teeth are
[1820.16 - 1824.64] falling apart i did his orange just eat
[1822.80 - 1826.72] one orange and eat three apples a day
[1824.64 - 1828.72] and my teeth are falling apart and they
[1826.72 - 1832.08] just all of a sudden now they have no
[1828.72 - 1834.32] idea that they came in here
[1832.08 - 1836.88] with time capsules and they just started
[1834.32 - 1838.88] falling apart cold white spring may
[1836.88 - 1840.72] what's going on mine fell apart before i
[1838.88 - 1842.64] found medical medium
[1840.72 - 1844.64] how lucky is medical medium that they
[1842.64 - 1847.04] fell apart before instead of during like
[1844.64 - 1849.12] right when you got here like in your may
[1847.04 - 1850.80] may have you got here and you started
[1849.12 - 1852.40] doing everything
[1850.80 - 1854.56] then they started falling apart you
[1852.40 - 1856.32] might be like that anthony you might not
[1854.56 - 1857.76] like me anymore but i don't know may you
[1856.32 - 1859.84] you know a lot of stuff so you probably
[1857.76 - 1861.76] would never be like that i know that
[1859.84 - 1864.00] about you you're awesome but
[1861.76 - 1866.00] and so the thing is is that it all
[1864.00 - 1868.16] depends when you're arriving into the
[1866.00 - 1870.80] medical meeting community
[1868.16 - 1872.16] that determines what's going to happen
[1870.80 - 1873.60] with your teeth
[1872.16 - 1875.52] you can come into the medical meeting
[1873.60 - 1877.52] community and do stuff and your teeth
[1875.52 - 1880.40] can still fall apart because it was
[1877.52 - 1882.64] years and years of bad stuff you got to
[1880.40 - 1885.28] hang in there to keep them from falling
[1882.64 - 1886.16] apart and and even get them better
[1885.28 - 1888.32] right
[1886.16 - 1890.56] what happens is the reason why teeth are
[1888.32 - 1893.84] depleting out there is because
[1890.56 - 1895.76] everybody's losing the insides of their
[1893.84 - 1897.84] teeth and their enamel because they're
[1895.76 - 1899.44] doing all the wrong stuff they're
[1897.84 - 1901.20] drinking their coffee they're drinking
[1899.44 - 1903.04] their espressos their green tea their
[1901.20 - 1904.08] matcha tea they're doing their kombucha
[1903.04 - 1905.76] tea
[1904.08 - 1907.20] it's not that i have all this stuff
[1905.76 - 1909.12] against kombucha tea where i hate
[1907.20 - 1910.88] kombucha tea or something so bad the
[1909.12 - 1912.88] problem is it's got caffeine in it it's
[1910.88 - 1914.64] also extremely acidic and it kills your
[1912.88 - 1916.48] teeth you've got all these yoga mamas
[1914.64 - 1918.72] out there and yoga papas that they're
[1916.48 - 1920.24] all into yoga studios and they're all
[1918.72 - 1922.16] doing their yoga they're drinking their
[1920.24 - 1924.40] kombucha tea and they're just they're
[1922.16 - 1926.16] about to kill their teeth give it just
[1924.40 - 1929.12] five more years get them out of their
[1926.16 - 1930.64] early 30s get them into their late 30s
[1929.12 - 1932.24] and all their teeth are going to need
[1930.64 - 1934.40] work and start falling apart because of
[1932.24 - 1936.32] their kombucha tea
[1934.40 - 1937.92] but every now and then someone will be
[1936.32 - 1939.20] in their late 30s about to lose all
[1937.92 - 1940.48] their teeth and they come into the
[1939.20 - 1942.00] medical meeting community because they
[1940.48 - 1943.20] got brain fog and all of a sudden their
[1942.00 - 1947.52] teeth start falling apart and they're
[1943.20 - 1949.60] like oh my god it's the medical media
[1947.52 - 1952.24] these time capsules
[1949.60 - 1954.40] they rot from the inside out and they
[1952.24 - 1956.88] just start crumbling and that's what
[1954.40 - 1959.36] happened sun moon love says lost all my
[1956.88 - 1961.84] teeth before finding medical medium so
[1959.36 - 1964.00] it all depends on where you land how you
[1961.84 - 1966.64] come into the medical medium community
[1964.00 - 1968.72] if you come in and the timing is just
[1966.64 - 1970.56] right with your teeth you already
[1968.72 - 1972.80] destroyed your teeth and didn't know it
[1970.56 - 1974.16] for two decades and you came into the
[1972.80 - 1976.96] medical media community and now they
[1974.16 - 1979.76] start falling apart
[1976.96 - 1981.84] that's the confusion
[1979.76 - 1984.08] marisa spiritual says my teeth on
[1981.84 - 1986.08] youtube my teeth all all fell apart
[1984.08 - 1988.24] before medical medium but after starting
[1986.08 - 1992.48] medical medium protocols i have healed a
[1988.24 - 1994.96] dark spot on my tooth i had for years

[1999.68 - 2002.80] on their own just from starting medical
[2001.52 - 2004.40] media

[2004.40 - 2007.76] years

[2438.72 - 2444.32] now 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice
[2444.96 - 2448.00] you want to strain your celery juice i
[2446.56 - 2451.36] always say that no matter what kind of
[2448.00 - 2454.80] juicer you have you want to strain it
[2451.36 - 2456.79] let's try to make some room back here
[2454.80 - 2459.89] so you want to strain it
[2456.79 - 2459.89] [Music]
[2462.40 - 2465.88] that's the key
[2467.36 - 2469.68] so
[2472.64 - 2475.96] there we go
[2486.40 - 2489.60] after all these years
[2491.76 - 2496.48] all right you got 16 and 32 ounces of
[2493.44 - 2496.48] celery juice right there
[2497.92 - 2501.92] okay
[2498.80 - 2503.52] wondering about the blender
[2501.92 - 2504.88] you can make celery juice with a blender
[2503.52 - 2506.16] if you want if you don't have a juicer
[2504.88 - 2507.60] make it make it with a blender but you
[2506.16 - 2509.76] got to squeeze it through a cheesecloth
[2507.60 - 2512.08] or a nut milk bag
[2509.76 - 2513.60] and that's okay if a blender's all you
[2512.08 - 2515.28] got throw celery in the blender but
[2513.60 - 2517.84] don't add water
[2515.28 - 2520.80] don't add water so if you do the celery
[2517.84 - 2522.48] juice in your blender don't add water
[2520.80 - 2524.00] you still got to strain it squeeze it
[2522.48 - 2526.40] through a nut milk bag you don't want a
[2524.00 - 2528.64] celery smoothie it's not going to work
[2526.40 - 2530.40] where it's just a celery smoothie right

[2791.76 - 2795.44] best supplement company hands down in my
[2794.00 - 2797.44] opinion out there
[2795.44 - 2800.16] with what they do it's just it's
[2797.44 - 2800.84] unmatched they got a new msm they came
[2800.16 - 2803.52] out
[2800.84 - 2805.44] with which is incredible
[2803.52 - 2807.68] they got the best cat's claw they got
[2805.44 - 2810.08] the best licorice out there to date they
[2807.68 - 2811.60] got the best lemon balm for all kinds of
[2810.08 - 2815.04] anxiety disorders and everything else
[2811.60 - 2817.76] i'm not sponsored by vimergy i'm not the
[2815.04 - 2820.08] owner of the company i'm not sponsored
[2817.76 - 2821.68] and i'm not an ambassador just letting
[2820.08 - 2823.12] you know but the stuff is that
[2821.68 - 2826.24] incredible it's the purest there's
[2823.12 - 2826.24] nothing like it out there
[2827.28 - 2830.64] this is the spirulina right here so i'm
[2829.12 - 2832.72] showing you guys the spirit lena this
[2830.64 - 2834.08] stuff is like incredible so i'm going to
[2832.72 - 2835.52] give you a little window into them to
[2834.08 - 2837.52] show you
[2835.52 - 2839.12] this is the best spirulina there is
[2837.52 - 2840.88] hands down
[2839.12 - 2842.96] i used to promote other spirulina
[2840.88 - 2845.28] companies in the past
[2842.96 - 2847.04] okay i don't anymore
[2845.28 - 2848.64] because this stuff doesn't compare to
[2847.04 - 2851.36] this one
[2848.64 - 2854.64] right doesn't compare to this one so i'm
[2851.36 - 2856.48] just going to tell you right now and
[2854.64 - 2857.60] but this is the best best one on the
[2856.48 - 2859.84] market
[2857.60 - 2861.44] the ones the ones i used to support in
[2859.84 - 2863.12] the past
[2861.44 - 2864.72] their quality
[2863.12 - 2866.88] doesn't touch this but it's not just
[2864.72 - 2869.68] that one of the companies i used to
[2866.88 - 2871.60] recommend all the time in the past
[2869.68 - 2873.04] something went down
[2871.60 - 2874.72] in in their product and they never
[2873.04 - 2876.32] wanted to talk to me about it and ever
[2874.72 - 2877.68] since then i would never even recommend
[2876.32 - 2879.76] them
[2877.68 - 2881.60] chris has said i was using vimergy
[2879.76 - 2883.68] products in my heavy metal detox
[2881.60 - 2886.64] smoothie and saw incredible results in
[2883.68 - 2888.72] such a short period of time when i ran
[2886.64 - 2890.24] out of energy i had to go to cheap
[2888.72 - 2893.92] brands and the rate of healing is
[2890.24 - 2897.20] significant uh significantly slower and
[2893.92 - 2899.52] and that's on facebook charissa chrisa
[2897.20 - 2902.72] i i have heard that and watched that
[2899.52 - 2905.76] over the years it see what people say is
[2902.72 - 2907.36] you always recommend vimera gaw
[2905.76 - 2909.44] i get you're not sponsored but you
[2907.36 - 2911.60] always recommend vimergy give the other
[2909.44 - 2914.00] supplement companies a chance
[2911.60 - 2916.80] but what happened was vimergy made the
[2914.00 - 2919.12] product so good all the products
[2916.80 - 2921.76] that what happened was people healed
[2919.12 - 2922.48] faster
[2921.76 - 2925.28] and
[2922.48 - 2928.16] like healed faster but not just healed
[2925.28 - 2930.16] faster healed things that i didn't see
[2928.16 - 2932.40] heal with the other products so it's
[2930.16 - 2934.32] like it's like so what do you do you
[2932.40 - 2937.28] give the other supplement companies that
[2934.32 - 2939.36] are lower quality a chance
[2937.28 - 2940.56] or do you promote
[2939.36 - 2942.96] something
[2940.56 - 2945.44] and recommend something that you know
[2942.96 - 2947.44] heals somebody faster that's the
[2945.44 - 2949.68] predicament i got in
[2947.44 - 2952.72] it's like so you see me always like it's
[2949.68 - 2955.68] always like vim rajiv energy
[2952.72 - 2957.28] but if it if you heal faster from what
[2955.68 - 2959.20] i've seen from what you said and from
[2957.28 - 2961.04] what i've seen everywhere including
[2959.20 - 2962.48] family and friends
[2961.04 - 2964.56] that i know
[2962.48 - 2966.56] and they heal quicker
[2964.56 - 2969.36] and then they when they don't use energy
[2966.56 - 2971.04] they don't heal as fast or heal at all
[2969.36 - 2973.44] and when i see that it's like what do
[2971.04 - 2975.52] you do you have to just be like you know
[2973.44 - 2977.44] what you work for the light
[2975.52 - 2979.52] hands down you just have to let people
[2977.44 - 2981.76] know what's the best stuff
[2979.52 - 2985.20] so anyway
[2981.76 - 2988.64] that's the spirulina right there
[2985.20 - 2991.28] i mean for neurological problems
[2988.64 - 2992.96] that's a that's a huge one right there
[2991.28 - 2994.96] for for helping people neurological
[2992.96 - 2997.20] problems catherine elizabeth love wild

[3045.12 - 3051.12] i don't have to worry
[3048.48 - 3055.00] because whatever steel
[3051.12 - 3055.00] comes off of these babies

[3385.68 - 3390.56] that if you had answers to why someone
[3388.40 - 3393.84] was sick
[3390.56 - 3395.92] and you had things that really did work
