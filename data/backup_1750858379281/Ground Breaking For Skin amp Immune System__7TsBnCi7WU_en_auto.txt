[276.24 - 279.06] you guys I'm gonna make a bunch of
[277.92 - 281.34] different things I'm just letting you
[279.06 - 284.76] know how incredible this is
[281.34 - 287.58] this is the micro C pack Julie says how
[284.76 - 290.10] is this different than micro C capsules
[287.58 - 292.26] it's enhanced the micro C capsules are
[290.10 - 293.94] amazing but here's the difference you
[292.26 - 295.98] don't have to open the capsules anymore
[293.94 - 299.10] so many people who open the capsules
[295.98 - 301.20] because you're doing the vitamin C shock
[299.10 - 302.64] therapy you're doing the medical medium
[301.20 - 304.80] vitamin C shot therapy and you're
[302.64 - 306.36] opening up the capsules right and so
[304.80 - 307.86] many of you are opening up the capsules
[306.36 - 310.14] for the kids
[307.86 - 311.52] that's how this is different all on its
[310.14 - 313.02] own and then that's not the only reason
[311.52 - 314.52] why this is different but that's how
[313.02 - 316.62] it's different everybody's opening up
[314.52 - 318.30] the capsules you see I think half the
[316.62 - 320.34] people out there easily open up the
[318.30 - 321.96] capsules because they're mixing it and
[320.34 - 323.58] things they're making the vitamin C
[321.96 - 325.80] shock therapy they're they're opening up
[323.58 - 327.84] the capsules for the kids all of that
[325.80 - 330.06] well you don't have to open up the
[327.84 - 331.32] capsules anymore the other thing is
[330.06 - 334.02] organic
[331.32 - 337.20] bamboo silica
[334.02 - 340.86] when you have organic bamboo silica in
[337.20 - 343.74] the mix of this already potent collagen
[340.86 - 346.80] also building properties that are in
[343.74 - 349.86] here with the immune enhancing because
[346.80 - 352.44] immune system in the skin
[349.86 - 354.72] immune system is in the skin
[352.44 - 356.70] and so when you feed your immune system
[354.72 - 359.46] and it's in the skin and then you've got
[356.70 - 361.56] the organic bamboo silica it's the other
[359.46 - 364.14] different
[361.56 - 365.70] different powerful thing about this
[364.14 - 366.90] anyway you guys link is in the
[365.70 - 369.42] description they just want you I have to
[366.90 - 370.92] let you guys know because I am so beyond

[736.86 - 741.14] of buffered vitamin C to get to your
[738.84 - 745.50] immune system
[741.14 - 748.02] vitamin C to stop oxidative stress
[745.50 - 750.54] breaks down and oxidizes our brains our
[748.02 - 754.68] minds oxidizes our bodies oxidizes Our
[750.54 - 757.98] organs right you got two pipes a
[754.68 - 760.92] buffered vitamin C in this
[757.98 - 762.66] immune powder two types
[760.92 - 764.34] it's like your immune cells are like
[762.66 - 766.20] wait a minute you're giving me one type
[764.34 - 768.48] wait a minute you're giving me two type
[766.20 - 771.12] what are you talking about
[768.48 - 773.70] what are you talking about

[779.46 - 784.56] immune system has Intelligence you guys
[782.22 - 786.42] and it and that intelligence is used so
[784.56 - 788.04] your immune system has these Intel this
[786.42 - 791.16] intelligence and it's like you're giving
[788.04 - 794.06] me two choices to choose from
[791.16 - 796.50] that's important lymphocytes
[794.06 - 798.66] lymphocytes have two varieties of
[796.50 - 801.84] vitamin C to choose from
[798.66 - 804.06] that's accessible assimilatable buffered
[801.84 - 807.36] think about how sick that is how insane
[804.06 - 809.46] that is right your white blood count has

[809.46 - 814.68] two vitamin C's to choose from your
[812.28 - 817.80] neutrophils basil all of it
[814.68 - 820.32] lymphocytes monocytes all your immune
[817.80 - 825.72] composition your immune cells all have
[820.32 - 828.48] two varieties of buffered vitamin C pH
[825.72 - 830.28] PhD up this is insane this is
[828.48 - 831.42] revolutionary this is groundbreaking and
[830.28 - 832.86] these are the things that make the

[982.08 - 987.84] I'm excited there it is
[985.92 - 991.02] all right let's start working on this
[987.84 - 992.46] right now first and foremost
[991.02 - 993.78] I'm gonna get some orange a half
[992.46 - 997.02] squeezed orange in here but I'm gonna
[993.78 - 1000.34] get some warm water
[997.02 - 1000.34] right off the kettle

[1023.06 - 1028.66] whole bunch of different immune power
[1026.00 - 1028.66] tools
[1029.96 - 1033.74] we get that in there like that I'm gonna
[1031.94 - 1036.38] drop some honey in there too so this is
[1033.74 - 1039.38] Vitamin C shock therapy if you guys know
[1036.38 - 1041.51] this so many of you guys have used this
[1039.38 - 1043.04] this is really powerful
[1041.51 - 1045.40] [Music]
[1043.04 - 1045.40] okay
[1046.06 - 1049.84] and here we go
[1050.54 - 1055.10] like I said when I see out there vitamin
[1053.84 - 1058.04] C's
[1055.10 - 1059.48] I shrill I shrug and there's a reason I
[1058.04 - 1061.46] think about the stomach aches the kids
[1059.48 - 1063.26] are gonna have I think about the belly
[1061.46 - 1065.96] aches the adults are gonna have I think
[1063.26 - 1068.84] about the acid poops people are gonna
[1065.96 - 1071.72] have the acid poops
[1068.84 - 1073.70] the acid runs the squirts
[1071.72 - 1075.74] because you can't take enough of the
[1073.70 - 1077.84] other vitamin C's out there without
[1075.74 - 1079.46] crapping your pants you can't take
[1077.84 - 1081.74] enough of the other vitamin C's out
[1079.46 - 1083.90] there without having the runs or
[1081.74 - 1085.58] diarrhea you can't take enough of the
[1083.90 - 1087.26] vitamin C's out there without burning
[1085.58 - 1090.08] your stomach and that's the difference
[1087.26 - 1091.64] right there so I know if you're here out
[1090.08 - 1093.62] there oh vitamin C is good for you
[1091.64 - 1096.62] vitamin C try this one and know what
[1093.62 - 1099.50] what people don't realize it just burns
[1096.62 - 1101.30] it burns it burns an ascorbic sharp that
[1099.50 - 1102.50] acid and then if you take too much of
[1101.30 - 1104.54] those vitamin C's out there you know
[1102.50 - 1107.00] what happens you're doing the squirts in
[1104.54 - 1109.52] the bathroom your stomach's all upset
[1107.00 - 1112.76] you can't take enough of it to actually
[1109.52 - 1115.28] work in your favor to help yourself all
[1112.76 - 1116.84] of these things they get in the way and
[1115.28 - 1118.16] it matters when you're somebody that's
[1116.84 - 1120.02] trying to heal and trying to move
[1118.16 - 1122.12] forward and get your life to where you
[1120.02 - 1125.00] need to get it it all matters this
[1122.12 - 1128.02] squirts exactly so okay let's get now

[1159.74 - 1163.28] people who are sick what this means for

[1286.22 - 1290.36] its own okay the other thing is the
[1288.74 - 1292.82] powder
[1290.36 - 1294.86] you can work with it differently if you

[1294.86 - 1300.14] Ball talking about a steal all right
[1298.34 - 1301.34] so I'm letting this kick in right now
[1300.14 - 1304.76] this is the
[1301.34 - 1306.80] vitamin C shock therapy hmm
[1304.76 - 1308.18] instantly when I'm taking that sip I
[1306.80 - 1310.22] want to tell you guys I want you guys
[1308.18 - 1312.34] you can do this with me too if you'd
[1310.22 - 1312.34] like
[1312.44 - 1316.40] what's happening is it's entering my
[1314.24 - 1319.58] body the first thing I'm saying is
[1316.40 - 1322.58] immune cells are you there
[1319.58 - 1325.70] okay lymphocytes are you there
[1322.58 - 1329.00] white blood count are you there
[1325.70 - 1331.46] and I'm connecting with it my immune
[1329.00 - 1334.00] system because what's entering my body
[1331.46 - 1339.02] is revolutionary it is groundbreaking
[1334.00 - 1341.96] this is an incredible vitamin C and
[1339.02 - 1345.08] vitamin C
[1341.96 - 1346.64] halts that oxidative stress so all the
[1345.08 - 1348.80] stress and oxidation that's happening
[1346.64 - 1350.60] inside my body from all the stress I'm
[1348.80 - 1351.92] under all the different stuff that we
[1350.60 - 1353.12] have to deal with the environmental
[1351.92 - 1354.62] pollutions coming out of the sky
[1353.12 - 1357.56] everything else
[1354.62 - 1360.50] right now I'm just seeing this vitamin C
[1357.56 - 1362.36] run through my body and start to break
[1360.50 - 1364.04] actually start to break that cycle of
[1362.36 - 1367.52] oxidative stress the next thing it is I
[1364.04 - 1370.16] want my immune system to receive
[1367.52 - 1371.84] and see it and recognize it and start to
[1370.16 - 1372.98] eat it and Gobble it up so this is
[1371.84 - 1374.54] important I'm going to have a little bit
[1372.98 - 1376.82] more
[1374.54 - 1378.80] in the micro C shock therapy
[1376.82 - 1381.74] if you guys just came on here
[1378.80 - 1383.12] we're talking about this right now
[1381.74 - 1385.22] all right
[1383.12 - 1387.38] so what I'm envisioning is my white
[1385.22 - 1390.26] blood cells
[1387.38 - 1392.24] they want to destroy microbes that are
[1390.26 - 1395.24] not supposed to be in me that's what our
[1392.24 - 1398.12] white blood cells love to do they seek
[1395.24 - 1402.20] them out they look for them
[1398.12 - 1405.20] but if they're under fed under fueled
[1402.20 - 1408.46] they don't work as good
[1405.20 - 1411.98] if the white blood cell is under fed
[1408.46 - 1415.52] malnourished not fueled to its capacity
[1411.98 - 1417.50] it doesn't do the job it needs to do so
[1415.52 - 1419.72] this is important to know
[1417.50 - 1421.04] so I'm envisioning that white blood cell
[1419.72 - 1424.40] right there
[1421.04 - 1427.94] all of a sudden running into
[1424.40 - 1430.10] that vitamin C that's going coursing
[1427.94 - 1432.38] through my bloodstream right now
[1430.10 - 1435.62] and what it does is our immune system
[1432.38 - 1436.76] loves to gobble up vitamin C it loves to
[1435.62 - 1440.00] use it
[1436.76 - 1444.26] getting fueled is critical so I like to
[1440.00 - 1446.92] Envision my immune cells taking in that
[1444.26 - 1446.92] vitamin C
[1447.20 - 1452.78] so good so delicious
[1450.32 - 1456.02] and as it's taking in that vitamin C
[1452.78 - 1459.92] it's strengthening and I see and
[1456.02 - 1462.50] envision my immune system strengthening
[1459.92 - 1464.72] coming empowered
[1462.50 - 1466.76] getting strong
[1464.72 - 1470.54] because you want your immune cells
[1466.76 - 1474.38] strong you want this immune powder
[1470.54 - 1478.04] to get infused into your immune cells
[1474.38 - 1480.44] this is a critical exercise right here
[1478.04 - 1482.78] an important one
[1480.44 - 1485.12] it has its gobbling up and gobbling up
[1482.78 - 1488.48] and absorbing
[1485.12 - 1490.28] that immune powder that's mainlined in
[1488.48 - 1492.74] your system
[1490.28 - 1495.62] okay it's getting stronger and you
[1492.74 - 1497.60] envision that you see it
[1495.62 - 1499.82] okay and then you give your immune
[1497.60 - 1502.34] system Direction
[1499.82 - 1504.38] I want you to go after things that are

[1504.38 - 1507.92] go after the microbes that are not
[1506.42 - 1509.60] supposed to be in me I want you to go
[1507.92 - 1512.62] after those little buggies that aren't

[1554.24 - 1557.08] there the micro C
[1557.78 - 1564.50] we're gonna put this now in a smoothie
[1562.04 - 1567.08] is next so what you see in front of me
[1564.50 - 1569.06] is a blender you guys on IG you can see
[1567.08 - 1570.62] this right
[1569.06 - 1572.66] and in this blender I'm going to make a
[1570.62 - 1575.00] green smoothie
[1572.66 - 1576.98] I got some mango I'm gonna use that for
[1575.00 - 1579.44] the green smoothie
[1576.98 - 1581.66] I have some spinach I'm going to use
[1579.44 - 1583.10] that for the green smoothie and I have
[1581.66 - 1584.48] some celery sticks I'm going to use that
[1583.10 - 1587.42] for the green smoothie
[1584.48 - 1588.68] but I'm gonna change things around a
[1587.42 - 1590.72] little bit
[1588.68 - 1593.48] I'm gonna add
[1590.72 - 1595.28] the micro C powder immune powder in this
[1593.48 - 1597.62] green smoothie
[1595.28 - 1599.30] that's what I'm gonna do
[1597.62 - 1602.18] I was really excited about this because
[1599.30 - 1603.86] I wanted to do this so bad now the green
[1602.18 - 1605.42] smoothie recipe I'm using right here is
[1603.86 - 1607.46] in cleanse the heel I don't know if you
[1605.42 - 1610.22] guys have this I want to show you
[1607.46 - 1612.98] that's the green smoothie recipe it's
[1610.22 - 1614.78] three medium sized bananas I prefer
[1612.98 - 1615.92] mango in this one right now I'm excited
[1614.78 - 1618.62] about that
[1615.92 - 1620.36] or three cups of diced mango so let's
[1618.62 - 1622.54] get the three cups of diced mango in
[1620.36 - 1622.54] here
[1622.64 - 1625.30] so great
[1627.02 - 1631.10] I love mango
[1629.00 - 1633.50] so I prefer some mango in this green
[1631.10 - 1635.24] smoothie right here
[1633.50 - 1638.90] we're gonna do three cups we're gonna
[1635.24 - 1641.36] get a decent amount of mango in here
[1638.90 - 1643.58] now if you you know what happens is that
[1641.36 - 1645.92] so many people break open the capsules
[1643.58 - 1647.84] they open the capsules because they want
[1645.92 - 1650.72] to take a lot of this incredible vitamin
[1647.84 - 1653.84] C this micro C because it's buffered
[1650.72 - 1656.18] it's easier it's easy on the body
[1653.84 - 1659.66] easy on the stomach easy on the stomach
[1656.18 - 1662.36] lining easy on the intestinal tract how
[1659.66 - 1663.74] incredible was that all in its own all
[1662.36 - 1664.94] right
[1663.74 - 1666.92] so
[1664.94 - 1669.14] the green smoothie recipe is not only
[1666.92 - 1671.48] that it's now one to two stalks of
[1669.14 - 1673.22] celery chopped
[1671.48 - 1675.26] so I'm gonna chop a couple of stalks of
[1673.22 - 1679.06] celery I'm gonna get that into this
[1675.26 - 1679.06] green smoothie just bear with me
[1682.16 - 1687.80] so many things you hear out there
[1684.98 - 1690.04] one to two stalks of celery
[1687.80 - 1690.04] foreign
[1695.42 - 1701.18] okay next thing is four cups of tightly
[1698.96 - 1704.54] packed spinach so I'm gonna get a
[1701.18 - 1709.48] measuring cup possibly here we are
[1704.54 - 1709.48] four cups of tightly packed spinach now
[1709.52 - 1714.86] what I like doing here
[1711.74 - 1717.44] is putting that buffered
[1714.86 - 1719.60] immune powder
[1717.44 - 1722.20] in a green smoothie
[1719.60 - 1722.20] yeah
[1722.54 - 1727.90] there we go I want a tight tightly pack
[1724.94 - 1727.90] this in right here
[1728.06 - 1732.02] you know you hear out there all the time
[1729.50 - 1734.72] vitamin C vitamin C and it's like
[1732.02 - 1736.40] meanwhile it's like
[1734.72 - 1739.76] yeah
[1736.40 - 1743.06] vitamin C all right what kind
[1739.76 - 1746.12] is it two kinds of buffered PhD out what
[1743.06 - 1748.34] kind is it just ascorbic strain acid
[1746.12 - 1750.20] burns a hole in your stomach or is it
[1748.34 - 1753.80] the kind with the fatty lipids attached
[1750.20 - 1756.98] to the ascorbic acid which has got awful
[1753.80 - 1758.84] because it the that inhibits the vitamin
[1756.98 - 1761.42] C you know getting to where it needs to
[1758.84 - 1763.28] get okay so that's four cups tightly
[1761.42 - 1766.36] packed spinach
[1763.28 - 1766.36] let's get this in here
[1767.66 - 1772.10] one cup of water
[1770.12 - 1773.72] if you really want you can put some some
[1772.10 - 1776.02] orange juice in there too if you really
[1773.72 - 1776.02] want
[1776.36 - 1779.98] all right spinach is going in

[1823.34 - 1827.14] all right let's give it a whirl
[1834.01 - 1837.08] [Music]
[1838.54 - 1844.88] I'm gonna bring it over here
[1842.12 - 1847.72] foreign
[1844.88 - 1847.72] there we go
[1852.70 - 1859.66] green smoothie with the immune powder
[1855.98 - 1859.66] the micro C immune powder right here
[1860.08 - 1864.28] collagen building properties
[1864.44 - 1869.51] I've been waiting so long for a really
[1867.02 - 1871.96] powerful collagen building property
[1869.51 - 1875.20] [Music]
[1871.96 - 1875.20] here we go
[1878.96 - 1881.74] nice
[1896.20 - 1902.66] you take all nuts
[1898.90 - 1904.82] when you take all that spinach
[1902.66 - 1907.16] and you bring that spinach
[1904.82 - 1910.60] with that vitamin C together so all
[1907.16 - 1910.60] those trace minerals from the spinach
[1912.20 - 1917.06] and you actually
[1914.48 - 1920.38] take that vitamin C and you mix it in
[1917.06 - 1920.38] there oh incredible
[1921.44 - 1924.88] that's our green smoothie right there
[1928.42 - 1935.12] wonderful with the immune building
[1932.78 - 1938.12] powder right there
[1935.12 - 1939.56] incredible there it is
[1938.12 - 1942.02] I don't know if you guys can see that
[1939.56 - 1943.94] but it's so perfect
[1942.02 - 1946.04] that is the green smoothie with the
[1943.94 - 1948.02] micro seed powder
[1946.04 - 1950.66] so not only are you actually getting the
[1948.02 - 1952.58] micro C powder collagen building effects
[1950.66 - 1954.20] right there you're bringing it into the
[1952.58 - 1956.60] green smoothie
[1954.20 - 1958.70] how good is that and what you won't see
[1956.60 - 1960.38] in this green smoothie is a whole bunch
[1958.70 - 1963.50] of fat you don't see a whole bunch of
[1960.38 - 1965.66] oil put into here or coconut oil because
[1963.50 - 1967.82] that inhibits what you're trying to do
[1965.66 - 1969.20] you especially if you're dealing with
[1967.82 - 1971.36] something or trying to battle something
[1969.20 - 1973.04] or you got a cold or you got something
[1971.36 - 1975.02] you're under the weather
[1973.04 - 1977.00] you want something as clean as this
[1975.02 - 1978.98] green smoothie without all the junk in
[1977.00 - 1981.08] it without all the garbage in it that
[1978.98 - 1983.66] all is natural flavors and I want to get
[1981.08 - 1985.76] to another point with that
[1983.66 - 1988.52] what you won't see in here are the
[1985.76 - 1990.80] anti-caking agents so understand that
[1988.52 - 1994.46] not only is this
[1990.80 - 1996.80] literally the best the best there is on
[1994.46 - 1999.32] the market but what you won't see in
[1996.80 - 2001.24] here and once you won't have to
[1999.32 - 2004.66] experience and eat
[2001.24 - 2007.06] is the anti-caking agents
[2004.66 - 2009.40] they don't put that in here
[2007.06 - 2013.06] that is groundbreaking all on its own
[2009.40 - 2015.28] that's revolutionary people don't know
[2013.06 - 2017.68] how good that really is and what that
[2015.28 - 2019.90] means because what happens is all these
[2017.68 - 2021.88] anti-kicking agents are in everybody's
[2019.90 - 2024.88] powders and they don't know it because
[2021.88 - 2026.68] you don't have to disclose it
[2024.88 - 2028.30] there's a rule you don't have to
[2026.68 - 2030.52] disclose a certain percentage of
[2028.30 - 2032.86] ingredients in the supplements out there
[2030.52 - 2035.08] in the world and companies will say how
[2032.86 - 2037.66] good and quality and how great the great
[2035.08 - 2040.90] it is but they'll never say
[2037.66 - 2043.78] there's no anti-caking agent in our
[2040.90 - 2046.18] product because they can't
[2043.78 - 2049.30] vimergy can say that there's no
[2046.18 - 2052.48] anti-kicking agents in this immune
[2049.30 - 2054.58] powder in this collagen promoting immune
[2052.48 - 2057.22] powder
[2054.58 - 2059.62] that alone is mind-blowing not to
[2057.22 - 2063.28] mention no alcohol not to mention no
[2059.62 - 2067.42] natural flavors which is MSG
[2063.28 - 2069.36] no vinegars no caffeine
[2067.42 - 2070.92] it's a whole nother thing all on its own
[2069.36 - 2074.02] that's
[2070.92 - 2075.88] mind-blowing we got the green smoothie
[2074.02 - 2078.22] made let's make some other things too
[2075.88 - 2080.32] while we can while we're here
[2078.22 - 2083.08] all right
[2080.32 - 2085.42] let's move on to the next one raw garlic
[2083.08 - 2087.16] therapy for colds have you guys been
[2085.42 - 2088.66] doing any of the raw garlic therapies at
[2087.16 - 2090.76] all for colds
[2088.66 - 2092.44] anybody anybody's trying any of that are
[2090.76 - 2094.24] you guys doing any of that
[2092.44 - 2097.36] because I just want to go over that for
[2094.24 - 2099.76] a little bit let's go let's hit it
[2097.36 - 2103.56] okay
[2099.76 - 2103.56] all right let's take the avocado out
[2104.20 - 2107.82] nice avocado right here

[2151.06 - 2157.24] pieces if you want you can also mash it
[2153.88 - 2160.12] I prefer to mash it I like it slightly
[2157.24 - 2164.04] with like hunkier pieces I don't like it
[2160.12 - 2164.04] where it's just like a cream cream
[2164.08 - 2168.64] I don't like avocado puree but that's
[2166.24 - 2170.74] just my opinion that's my taste that's
[2168.64 - 2174.40] my choice you can make it any way you
[2170.74 - 2178.00] want to make it so I'm mixing this up
[2174.40 - 2179.98] there you go then you can use a garlic

[2343.12 - 2345.82] able to really do this in fact you're
[2344.68 - 2347.38] not going to be able to do this has to
[2345.82 - 2349.48] be a steamed potato or a cooked potato
[2347.38 - 2351.46] maybe you have a baked potato and that's
[2349.48 - 2353.68] what you have

[2390.88 - 2394.54] gonna get the garlic
[2392.80 - 2395.98] garlic clove now you can do this three
[2394.54 - 2400.14] times a day too

[2404.62 - 2407.28] there you go
[2408.58 - 2411.24] all right
[2414.40 - 2418.24] there you go
[2416.08 - 2419.62] one more get that little piece out there
[2418.24 - 2422.02] this little
[2419.62 - 2425.46] garlic cover
[2422.02 - 2425.46] there we go there we go
[2427.96 - 2433.06] okay we're good SS but he says not to
[2430.54 - 2435.16] have avocados in this morning not to eat
[2433.06 - 2436.18] too many I've said that depending on
[2435.16 - 2438.76] what's happening with your health
[2436.18 - 2441.52] overall but
[2438.76 - 2443.56] this is this is a different situation
[2441.52 - 2446.44] this is when you feel like you're coming
[2443.56 - 2450.22] down with something this is cold and flu
[2446.44 - 2452.26] garlic therapy for colds and flu
[2450.22 - 2454.42] you don't even have to start it in the
[2452.26 - 2456.88] morning who says it has to be morning
[2454.42 - 2458.68] that's the next thing too you can do
[2456.88 - 2460.36] this three times a day and start this in
[2458.68 - 2462.46] the afternoon do it later in the
[2460.36 - 2464.26] afternoon and at night and this is an
[2462.46 - 2466.72] option you don't have to use avocado
[2464.26 - 2468.34] either that's the other point too this
[2466.72 - 2471.58] option right here is potato there's no
[2468.34 - 2474.10] avocado in this option so you have this
[2471.58 - 2476.74] to do you don't have to say wow my only
[2474.10 - 2478.78] way to do this is just avocado how am I
[2476.74 - 2480.94] going to do that that's actually
[2478.78 - 2482.92] actually you have all these different
[2480.94 - 2483.76] options that's the potato one right
[2482.92 - 2485.86] there
[2483.76 - 2488.14] okay I'm gonna try it out if you guys
[2485.86 - 2489.94] don't mind
[2488.14 - 2492.72] hmm

[2493.06 - 2496.90] three times a day you can do that now
[2495.46 - 2498.28] remember if you want to do the avocado
[2496.90 - 2500.56] version you don't want to avocado in the
[2498.28 - 2502.54] morning exactly you don't want to have
[2500.56 - 2504.82] the avocado with your celery juice then
[2502.54 - 2506.30] you do it later on
[2504.82 - 2507.08] how great is that

[3065.94 - 3071.22] garlic you can you can the raw garlic
[3069.48 - 3074.28] stronger
[3071.22 - 3075.84] raw garlic is stronger but if for some
[3074.28 - 3077.22] reason it's too strong for you it's
[3075.84 - 3079.62] really intense and do a little bit of
[3077.22 - 3081.72] raw garlic do a little piece of the
[3079.62 - 3085.38] clove if you want let me get a little
[3081.72 - 3087.42] clip like one here and I'll show you
[3085.38 - 3090.60] I wanted to show you real quick
[3087.42 - 3093.48] so I'm taking a small piece of a clove

[3093.48 - 3096.06] opened it up right there can you see
[3094.80 - 3097.50] that you guys
[3096.06 - 3099.66] see that right there
[3097.50 - 3101.88] okay if that's all you can do because
[3099.66 - 3105.66] it's raw garlic and raw garlic is so
[3101.88 - 3107.94] pungent it's so strong it's it can bite
[3105.66 - 3110.34] it's very bitey sometimes if that's all
[3107.94 - 3112.62] you got to do then use a little bit in
[3110.34 - 3114.90] that garlic therapy for cold slews and
[3112.62 - 3116.64] so forth that I just showed you but if
[3114.90 - 3118.26] you can't do that because raw Garlic's a
[3116.64 - 3120.36] little too hard on you do the roasted
[3118.26 - 3122.28] garlic do it the same way I showed you
[3120.36 - 3124.80] apply it the same way
[3122.28 - 3126.24] with roasted garlic I would probably
[3124.80 - 3128.82] recommend doing a little bit more than
[3126.24 - 3130.26] one clove if it's roasted garlic this
[3128.82 - 3132.72] way you get a little bit more of the
[3130.26 - 3134.70] garlic because it was roasted it's going
[3132.72 - 3136.38] to lose some of its properties and some
[3134.70 - 3138.54] of its value so you want you can
[3136.38 - 3140.40] actually do more than one and that's
[3138.54 - 3142.80] fine
[3140.40 - 3145.38] show you guys I'm just saying check out
[3142.80 - 3147.84] vimorgy check them out vimergy.com
[3145.38 - 3150.24] Linkus is also link is in the profile
[3147.84 - 3152.40] right there so the link is in the
[3150.24 - 3155.28] profile in the description
[3152.40 - 3157.02] you'll see you see the big size you see
[3155.28 - 3158.34] the trial size you get the free lemon
[3157.02 - 3162.60] balm with it
[3158.34 - 3165.60] but honestly no anti-caking agents no
[3162.60 - 3167.76] MSG no natural flavor crap no alcohol no
[3165.60 - 3169.56] caffeine none of the junk never mind you
[3167.76 - 3171.24] know when you see products go no soy no
[3169.56 - 3173.28] whatever it's like yeah but you got you
[3171.24 - 3175.26] got anti-caking agents in there buddy
[3173.28 - 3177.24] and you got natural flavors in there
[3175.26 - 3179.46] buddy and you've got citric acid in
[3177.24 - 3182.28] there buddy which is really bad and you
[3179.46 - 3184.44] got you got forms of alcohol that you're
[3182.28 - 3185.58] not even disclosing you got all that in
[3184.44 - 3186.90] there but you ain't telling the
[3185.58 - 3188.78] customers or the consumers because
[3186.90 - 3192.00] you're allowed to do that
[3188.78 - 3193.74] vermergy isn't that
[3192.00 - 3196.26] and that's the difference and that's why
[3193.74 - 3198.72] I support them I could support
[3196.26 - 3201.30] any company I want
[3198.72 - 3202.26] companies knock on my door day in and
[3201.30 - 3204.84] day out
[3202.26 - 3208.26] over the years thousands of companies
[3204.84 - 3210.72] get aw on board but I won't support
[3208.26 - 3214.62] anybody I won't support any company
[3210.72 - 3218.28] unless they go so above board and so
[3214.62 - 3221.88] Advanced and so ahead of the Curve
[3218.28 - 3224.88] and they do it in a way that's good for
[3221.88 - 3227.70] the customer in every way possible
[3224.88 - 3229.14] and only thinking in their behalf on
[3227.70 - 3230.94] their behalf and that's what I'm talking
[3229.14 - 3232.98] about you guys know I work with these
[3230.94 - 3234.72] guys because of that I want this company
[3232.98 - 3236.28] to stick around for The Chronic Leo and
[3234.72 - 3237.84] people don't realize it
[3236.28 - 3239.40] there's always going to be a company out
[3237.84 - 3241.74] there saying they got this and this and
[3239.40 - 3243.48] they got fancy this and that
[3241.74 - 3246.36] but they ain't in it for the chronically
