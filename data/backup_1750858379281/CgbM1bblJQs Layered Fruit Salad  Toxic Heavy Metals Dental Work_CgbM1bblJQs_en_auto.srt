okay merida papaya here it is right here

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
sherry i'm currently

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,159
so ill doctors can't tell me what's

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,120
wrong with me and that you know

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,480
it's really that's so hard and and

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
depending on how many doctors you've

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
gone to

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
too that's so difficult i i mean i

121
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
understand i've watched this for years

122
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,439
that's

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,760
that's a part of what propelled me

124
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,160
to put out the new edition so people can

125
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,400
be their own detective

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
they can learn how to heal they can

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,799
learn how to find out what's wrong with

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
themselves

129
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,680
why i put the book out there before the

130
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,160
books came out there for 30 years i was

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
known as the bizarre symptoms guy i was

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
sent

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,080
uh people were sent to me through

134
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
doctors

135
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,360
to find out what was going on with their

136
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
bizarre symptoms and all that and that's

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
what my work was all these years and all

138
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
these years

139
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,840
and so i put tremendous amount of

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
information in a new addition you can

141
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,080
always take it to your doctor too

142
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
and try to give them a little lead maybe

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
a little you know

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,199
kind of give them a clue to help them

145
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
and

146
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,919
what's really annoying is when a doctor

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
makes a comment somewhere on social

148
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
media on one of the platforms whether

149
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,880
it's ig

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
or tick tock or something and they they

151
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
comment

152
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,280
about something they don't like that i'm

153
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
doing like putting out information to

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
help people heal

155
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,280
and they they comment and meanwhile they

156
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
don't even know why anybody's sick they

157
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
don't know why people are coming to him

158
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
every day that are sick they don't know

159
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
they don't know you know why someone's

160
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,280
got fatigue they don't know why someone

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
has eczema

162
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,199
and they're like oh is there any study

163
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
behind that okay well that's funny

164
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,520
because

165
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
so many people are going doctor to

166
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
doctor to doctor to doctor can't find

167
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,000
answers can't figure out what's wrong

168
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,400
with them don't know how to heal

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
spending thousands of doctors what if

170
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
they don't have an insurance

171
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
card too what if they don't have

172
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,759
insurance and it's all coming out of

173
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
their pocket every bit of it it's so sad

174
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
it's good to have answers it's good to

175
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039

home at their computer they don't want

242
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
to go to

243
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
go to the doctor they don't want to go

244
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,800
to the office with the other doctors and

245
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
work

246
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
and that's happening now that's a big

247
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,680
thing going on this is what i do right

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
here

249
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
or they go into cosmetics they go a lot

250
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
of doctors go into cosmetics because

251
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
they

252
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,360
figure let's put lip filler in you know

253
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
women in men's mouth let's do lip filler

254
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
and that's

255
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
a way to kind of like escape like

256
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
all the people coming with problems

257
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,800
medical problems left and right with no

258
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,039
answers because it gets really tiresome

259
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
for a doctor when a doctor has to sit

260
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
there

261
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,479
while patients are rolling in all day

262
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,759
and they don't have a clue to why

263
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
they're sick

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
that's really hard for doctors they

265
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
don't have a clue to why anybody's got

266
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
fatigue and rna and

267
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
skin disorders and different conditions

268
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
they have to scratch your head all day

269
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,440
long

270
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
and be like i don't know why people are

271
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,840
sick and because of that no and the

272
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
doctors just go well what do i do let me

273
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
look at my textbook here

274
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,200
let me look at my my textbook when i

275
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,640
just came out of med school it says

276
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,360
jeans tell them genes

277
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
tell them it's a genetic disorder um

278
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
ma'am

279
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
um that's a genetic disorder we think

280
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
it's your genes

281
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
uh really you need this i'm your 10th

282
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,240

283
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,279
oh no i'm your 15th doctor and that 15

284
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
doctors just told you

285
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,480
is your genes too and so what happens is

286
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,240
you know they don't know so they go into

287
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560

saying is anything bad or good about it

290
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
if that's what you do or that's what you

291
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
want to do i'm not saying that a lot of

292
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
men and women do it right

293
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,519

influencer and they don't track it back

383
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
or cite it back to medical meaning books

384
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320

385
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
with the medical medium book it started

386
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
with lectures it started with all that

387
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,279
it taught people about fruit fear and

388
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,240
without they're not doing it on purpose

701
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
some of it but some of it is

702
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,159
and then no one pays the price when you

703
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,880
lose your teeth no one pays the price

704
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,960

when they shouldn't be

709
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,679
and no one's paying the price after all

710
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
those years of telling you all those

711
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,919
good things or when they tell you fish

712
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760

new addition and they tell you to do all

717
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,679
that fish oil and all that fish oil does

718
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,919

749
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,840
in

750
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
or however as long as you're proactive

751
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
and you're doing like the heavy metal

752
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,159
detox smoothie

753
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
you're getting the metals out um

754
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,520
if that was my daughter i would have her

755
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,919
on the heavy metal detox movie

756
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
but ask your doctor you know whatever

757
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,799
your doctor

758
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,039
wants to do listen to your doctor but if

759
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,200
it was my daughter

760
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,880
or if it was a you know family and

761
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
friends and all i'd be

762
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,159
saying hey heavy metal detox smoothie

763
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,679
just to keep up

764
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:39,360
so that any kind of any kind of metals

765
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,279
at all are being uh taken up even if

766
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,000
even if the caps are still there or the

767
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,080
fillings are still

768
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,760
there you're being proactive by cleaning

769
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,679
up any metals that escape

770
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,320
and go anywhere that's what i would do

771
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,880
if she was my daughter

772
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,159
um ask your doctor and do it do do what

773
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,400

801
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,279
blood doctors that just don't know what

802
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,400
causes anything out there it's true they

803
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,039
just don't

804
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,000
but they're quick to comment on social

805
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
media as if they

medical medium new edition going to talk

820
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,080
about mercury

821
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,000
i'm going to talk about the mercury

822
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,120
demon

823
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,320
fit and fab can this heal vitiligo

824
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,440
well healing vitiligo determines on

825
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,919
learning about vitiligo right so it's

826
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,120
about

827
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,799
learning about the cause of vitiligo

828
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,799
it's about having the medical medium

829
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,960
books so you can learn about it vitiligo

830
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,720
the cause of it is aluminum

831
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,799
and the epstein-barr virus so what

832
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
happens is the epstein-barr virus sits

833
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,360
inside your liver

834
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,559
it feeds off of aluminum that's inside

835
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,760
your liver

836
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,320
and then releases a dermatoxin that

837
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,760
kills

838
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,760
melanin the pigment that's behind

839
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
the vitiligo and you end up with your

840
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,520
vitiligo so it's all about

841
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,120
doing an antiviral protocol knowing how

842
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
to do it and getting rid of the aluminum

843
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
heavy metal detox

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
smoothie it's all about that if i had

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,720
vitiligo i'd be on the heavy metal detox

846
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,240
movie i'd be on the vimergy spirulina

847
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
i'd be on the vimergy barley grass

848
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
that's what i would be doing and be on

849
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,000
the medical medium

850
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,440
heavy metal detox smoothie debbie my

851
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,520
girlfriend who is on

852
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,679
keto would say that is way too many

853
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,640
fruits carbohydrates

854
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,240
yeah i bet i bet she would say that i

855
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,840
bet she would say that

856
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
definitely guys i'm putting more mango

857
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,480
here

858
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,399
but no one's ever gotten sick from

859
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,120
eating fruit because no one ever ate any

860
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,360
fruit

861
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,799
we've had millions and millions and

862
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,559
millions and hundreds of millions of

863
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,399
sick people around the globe

864
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,760
for decades and decades and decades

865
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,559
hundreds of millions of sick people and

866
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
guess what fruit wasn't on their plate

867
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,880
i think some people probably had a half

868
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,760
a grapefruit once in a while with little

869
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,120
sugar on top maybe on a sunday or maybe

870
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,799
somebody had blueberry and blueberry

871
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,679
muffins maybe they had a banana and a

872
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,240
banana split

873
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
maybe it had fake strawberries in a in a

874
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,399
milkshake somewhere right

875
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,720
maybe they had that but fruit isn't the

876
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,640
number one food group but guess what

877
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
the number one food group is the food

878
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,360
group keto people are on

879
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,399
you know what it is it's caffeine

880
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,880
and guess what keto people they get sick

881
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,240
they get sick a lot i've had sick

882
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,840
celebrities

883
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,760
knock on my door over the years that

884
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,840
were on keto i've had sick

885
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,919
doctors knock on my door that were on

886
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,679
keto some that were making a career out

887
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
of keto and had to knock on my door

888
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,640
because they were getting so sick

889
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,679
and i've had i've seen it all out there

890
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,840
keto doesn't mean

891
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,799
you're safe oh i'm not keto i'm safe

892
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,120
i'll never get sick

893
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,520
i'm on keto i'm i'm good i'm not going

894
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,440
to get sick because i'm on keto so

895
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,440
that's never going to happen quite the

896
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,320
contrary because

897
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,840
keto doesn't mean anything plant-based

898
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,840
doesn't even mean anything

899
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,440
if you don't do it right you can be

900
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,960
doing keto and do it wrong

901
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
you can be doing plant-based and do it

902
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,000
wrong oh that's right but someone lost

903
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520
weight doing keto after getting off of

904
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
processed foods so maybe they're doing

905
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,039
it right no

906
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,880
and they still are on that vinegar and

907
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,320
that caffeine and other things like that

908
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
and they still got toxic heavy metals

909
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
and pathogens and guess what they still

910
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
get sick

911
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,840
and they still get into the dentist

912
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,600
chair and they still lose they still

913
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,320
need all their veneers

914
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,240

917
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360

know all of that stuff so now

922
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
keto doesn't mean jack squat when it

923
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
comes to

924
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,360

out of there so you know

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,039
because that that really reminds me of

947
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,159
so many mistakes that are being made out

948
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,039
there right now

949
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,240
um so many mistakes there really is some

950
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,679
of the fruit for your chapter as we

951
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,559
speak

952
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,399
so ryan can you speak on lectins i'm

953
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,559
hearing more and more recently and it's

954
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,080
freaking me out since most of my diet is

955
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,840
fruits and vegetables

956
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,000
it's just gonna sidetrack you to get you

957
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,960
sicker down the road it's a trick

958
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,640
see before the lectin thing blew up a

959
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,320
few years ago

960
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,919
already millions of people healed around

961
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,480
the world from the medical medium books

962
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,960
okay

963
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,399
so the lectin guys were pretending

964
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
nobody got better

965
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,080
they were like in a bubble or something

966
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,080
where they were pretending

967
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
no one got better until they actually

968
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,640
took a few people off of some foods with

969
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,360
leptin

970
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
what they really did is they just took

971
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,080
them off a processed food so it was

972
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,039
another

973
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,679
kind of hit and miss keto diet is what

974
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
they did

975
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,840
they took you off of fruits they took

976
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
you off of some different vegetables

977
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,919
they took you off of some

978
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,399
starchy carbs and what they did was they

979
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,320
just

980
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,399
put basically they put you on some meat

981
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,679
and vegetables certain vegetables right

982
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,760
and then if you were somebody that were

983
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,519
on processed foods you'd be like whoa

984
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,039
i'm getting better now i'm losing a

985
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,080
little weight i think i'm feeling a

986
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,799
little better

987
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,679
and it was the lectins and it was

988
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,519
probably the

989
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,919
one of the greatest scams in the last

990
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,559
three four years was the lectin scam

991
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,120
um and you know it's really ridiculous

992
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
so

993
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,320
what you're going to be told is don't

994
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,720
eat fruits don't eat you know don't eat

995
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,519
some vegetables don't eat

996
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,600
tomato the big lectin guy was like don't

997
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,679
eat celery don't eat celery and then

998
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,840
the whole thing blew up with the celery

999
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,000
juice movement so big he had to give in

1000
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,679
and be like okay you can eat celery

1001
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,679
celery's fine well you don't have to

1002
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,120
worry about those leptins because

1003
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,799
because the whole thing was so many

1004
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,760
people were healing it just stomped on

1005
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
everybody the

1006
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
celery just moved in just stomped on all

1007
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,480
the podcast doctors all the other

1008
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,880
authors in health

1009
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,320
and so what happened is just the lectin

1010
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
thing is really

1011
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,480
it's so misguided there's so much

1012
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,840
misinformation about the lectin stuff

1013
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,960
it's ridiculous so people have healed

1014
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,600
from these foods these herbs leafy

1015
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
greens

1016
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,760
fruits and wild foods okay and

1017
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,399
vegetables and in the way medical medium

1018
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
has

1019
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,280
the medical medium information has laid

1020
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,200
out debilitating diseases

1021

percent

1026
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
tens of thousands of healing stories and

1027
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,320
they were eating lectins

1028
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
they were eating the lectins these

1029
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,040
lectin

1030
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,320
supplement guys try to sell you so

1031
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,280
here's how it works

1032
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,119
the lectin movement started with people

1033
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
trying to sell

1034
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,119
supplements that were supposedly

1035
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,560
protecting you against lectins

1036
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,560
it was a scam that's how it was done

1037
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,119
so it was like let's tell you about

1038
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,159
lectins so we can sell you a lectin

1039
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,839
supplement

1040
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,520
and that's that's that's how it started

1041
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,400
i'm just just being straight up about

1042
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,800
what was going on

1043
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
lectins are in everything and if you

1044
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
want to not eat anything

1045
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,800
like don't eat any food it's it's

1046
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,079
lectins are in everything so don't eat

1047
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,599
any food whatsoever and

1048
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,760
um you know just just live off of

1049
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
i don't know dirt and water i don't know

1050
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,240
live off of something

1051
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
try to find something to live off of

1052
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,960
okay maybe put some rocks

1053
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,560
in a soup in a pot of boiling water

1054
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,920
throw some rocks in there and throw a

1055
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,000
little mud in there

1056
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,160
and then try to like stir it up in hopes

1057
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,760
that you you avoid lectins because

1058
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,400
there's lectins in everything and

1059
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,160
um and there's still lectins in dirt

1060
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,079
there's still some lectins in turn

1061
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,599
so the point is is like i guess you just

1062
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,359
can't eat anything right

1063
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,040
so the lectin scam was one of the

1064
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,160
greatest scams and it made a lot of

1065
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
people a lot of money

1066
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,920
made a lot of people a lot of money so

1067
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,560
you'll just fall for the scam

1068
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
but um hey look try to give you the best

1069
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,160
information i can right

1070
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,240
and when it comes down to fruit fear

1071
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,079
really important and you know it

1072
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,920
information to know it turned out to be

1073
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,760
fruit is a dirty word because of the war

1074
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,560
on sugar and then fruit got thrown into

1075
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,160
there it's like

1076
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,640
sugar's bad sugar's bad so

1077
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,119
fruit must be bad too fruit must be bad

1078
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,119

diseases caused by

1118
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,960
unhealthy diet do you talk about

1119
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,119
autoimmune diseases in your books

1120
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,720
not only do i talk about autoimmune

1121
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,480
diseases in the books

1122
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,760
i talk about how your body doesn't

1123
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,440
attack itself

1124
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
and that's what science research says

1125
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,119
science science and research will say

1126
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,119
amanda that your body is turning on

1127
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,000
itself and that's what autoimmune is

1128
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,720
they think so their theory from 1950

1129
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,720
is that your body's immune system is

1130
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,240
destroying itself so if you

1131
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,520
were diagnosed with any kind of

1132
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,400
autoimmune disease whether it's

1133
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,720
hashimoto's or ra or anything

1134
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,880
they they say that your body is turning

1135
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,560
on itself and destroying your cell your

1136
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
yourself destroying your organs and all

1137
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,599
that so your immune system now that's

1138
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,920
misinformation

1139
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,599
that's a theory that's misguided and

1140
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,680
that's designed to body shame you and

1141
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,040
also make you basically hate your body

1142
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
and feel like you're a failure and

1143
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,920
you're never going to heal because your

1144
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,079
body's turning against itself

1145
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,040
dr fan incredible doctor right here at

1146
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,079
md

1147
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,400
um you are the man that's all i could

1148
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,920
say

1149
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,320
you are an incredible guy i'm glad

1150
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,480
you're here amazing doctor by the way

1151
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
so look the bottom line is with

1152
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
autoimmune your body doesn't destroy

1153
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,839
itself

1154
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,240
it's not attacking itself and

1155
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,200
that's how much autoimmune information

1156
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,599
is in my books

1157
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,200
it's like there's volumes of it for

1158
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,359
autoimmune the true cause

1159
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
viruses so it's viruses that cause

1160
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,359
autoimmune

1161
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,560
that's the cause of it and viruses like

1162
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,359
epstein-barr

1163
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,000
that's the cause of autoimmune but it's

1164
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,320
not really

1165
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,760
autoimmune it's just the cause of the

1166
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,160
symptoms people are getting that are

1167
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
being

1168
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,280
labeled as the body's attacking itself

1169
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,560
so

1170
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
if you got a condition and that virus is

1171
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
behind it

1172
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,720
and i talk about that in the books and

1173
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,079

they drain you until you basically die

1236
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
they'll drain the sicker you are

1237
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,680
they'll take more blood and more blood

1238
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,800

1239
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,400
just take it until you're done

1240
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,839
until you're done

1241
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,440
i've seen people get better by just

1242
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,079
taking doctor breaks

1243
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,319
doctor breaks with like i'm so sick but

1244
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
yet i've been to five or seven doctors i

1245
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,200
need to take a break i can't go to

1246
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,359
another doctor

1247
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,800
and and they get this moment of reprieve

1248
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,839
and their family's not pushing them to

1249
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
the doctor in that moment

1250
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,280
and they don't know it they start

1251
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,880
getting a little better because they're

1252
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,280
not getting the blood drawn

1253
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,440
and taken out constantly anymore they're

1254
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,319
getting a chance to come back

1255
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,000
and and survive i mean they'll bleed you

1256
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,240
to death

1257
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
is what they'll do so i'm cutting up

1258
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,880

1259
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,880

secret

1302
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,280
and that's the mercury demon so i'm

1303
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,560
gonna read a little piece of it right

1304
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,000
here

1305
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,119
so is mercury gone yet no

1306
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,960
it's not gone yet right

1307
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,560
is the nightmare finally over with

1308
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,319
mercury

1309
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,560
have we come to our senses and learned

1310
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,000
to avoid it at all costs for the sake of

1311
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
humankind

1312
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,880
for the sake of our health and

1313
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,920
well-being for the sake of our children

1314
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,560
nope we haven't it's just that it's out

1315
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,400
of sight

1316
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,160
and out of mind there's still plenty of

1317
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,839
mercury to be had it's constantly at her

1318
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,640
fingertips in ways

1319
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,319
that are extremely controversial so i'm

1320
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,839
going to give you that right now

1321
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,319
extremely controversial think about that

1322
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,319
for a little bit

1323
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,640
you know what's happening in today's

1324
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,520
world this is extremely controversial

1325
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,880
right

1326
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:38,160
and there's mercury involved in

1327
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,560
today's extremely controversial

1328
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,319
stuff happening in the world so that's

1329
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,480
important to know

1330
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,079
just as a result of modern living over

1331
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,119
time your body will accumulate

1332
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,240
toxic heavy metals such as mercury your

1333
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,640
body will

1334
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,160
accumulate that mercury every day it

1335
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,680
falls out of the sky

1336
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,839
it's in pharmaceuticals it's

1337
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,599
everywhere there's still plenty of

1338
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,200
mercury out there it accumulates over

1339
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
time we're continually exposed to this

1340
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,839
toxin because it slips through the

1341
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,920
cracks

1342
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,160
figuratively it slips through the cracks

1343
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,560
of our healthcare and industrial systems

1344
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,880
literally mercury absorbs into the

1345
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,960
cracks of your brain

1346
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,160
and all of us have some level of mercury

1347
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,280
inside our bodies it's unavoidable

1348
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,280
so that's important to know so i'm

1349
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,440
reading a little bit on the mercury

1350
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,280
okay why should we care why should you

1351
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,240
guys care why should i care

1352
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,440
because mercury is a top fuel for

1353
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,079
viruses

1354
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,520
that's a top fuel for why people are

1355
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,040
sick this is advanced

1356
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,560
information right here so if you guys

1357
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,280
are here just letting you know it's

1358
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,520
advanced

1359
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,359
information in the medical field that's

1360
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,319
teaching people's out people people out

1361
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:50,079
there so it's important to know

1362
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:52,880
it's the top fuel for viruses viruses

1363
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,040
eat mercury that's the big one there why

1364
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,960
are some cases of neurological lyme

1365
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,800
really really bad not just from the

1366
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,280
antibiotic use that happens

1367
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,839
but because viruses behind neurological

1368
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,440
lime

1369
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,520
feed off of mercury that means they have

1370
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,800
a lot of mercury in them bad cases of

1371
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,240
fibromyalgia

1372
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,920
chronic fatigue syndrome at me

1373
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,119
neurological lyme just a lot of

1374
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
different conditions

1375
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,040
you got high mercury and you've got the

1376
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,640
tingles and numbness aches and pains of

1377
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,359
dizziness and that's just not it you've

1378
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,520
got floaters in the eyes

1379
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,200
body pain burning pain jaw pain all

1380
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,839
these different things people have

1381
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,599
that's because there's lots of mercury

1382
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,559
for the virus to feed

1383
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,240
off of and zeolite doesn't cover it it

1384
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,920
doesn't cover it i'm letting you know

1385
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,079
anybody says oh you just need the

1386
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,559
zeolite no stuff's been around for 20

1387
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,319
years

1388
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,839
it never worked so i medical media

1389
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,839
information how to put out

1390
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,440
the right way of getting metals out and

1391
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,040
that's what's saving so many people's

1392
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,480
lives right now

1393
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,000
and so mercury is top fuel for viruses

1394
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,359
cancer and bacteria so

1395
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,160
cancers caused by viruses

1396
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,079
okay for the most part caused by viruses

1397
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,599
that's the cancer is caused by

1398
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,720
and mercury feeds that

1399
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,720
virus it feeds those cancer cells

1400
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,480
so that's important to know so mercury

1401
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,040
is a toxin so to make

1402
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,680
cancer you have to have viruses and you

1403
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,720
have to have

1404
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,640
toxins so to create cancer you need both

1405
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,680
those things you need a virus

1406
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,359
and you need toxins well mercury is high

1407
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,200
on that toxin list

1408
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,200
and so if you got the viruses and you

1409
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,520
got the mercury if you don't get

1410
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,440
one out and they're both there for a

1411
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,640
long time and it happens to be a pretty

1412
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,000
annoying virus

1413
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
then you can end up with some type of

1414
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,960
cancer

1415
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,200
important to know mercury exposure is a

1416
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,200
factor behind inflammation

1417
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,040
and it can take people hostage by

1418
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,400
causing or contributing to a vast number

1419
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,520
of symptoms and conditions

1420
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,240
okay so mercury can help take

1421
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,760
somebody hostage right i don't have any

1422
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
mercury to show you guys

1423
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,760
because you know maybe i need a mercury

1424
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,280
prop i got to figure that out like

1425
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,839
where's the mercury prop like what can i

1426
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
use for

1427
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,040
mercury prop right mercury so mercury

1428
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,720
exposure is a factor behind inflammation

1429
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,480
and can take people hostage

1430
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,640
by causing or contributing to a vast

1431
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,920
number of symptoms and conditions

1432
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,960
all right so including depression

1433
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,160
yeah mercury anxiety yeah

1434
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,040

pain in the back of the head anxiety

1438
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,839
it's neurological

1439
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,720
brain fog neurological aches and pains

1440
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,520
neurological

1441
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,720
fatigue neurological so just think about

1442
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,480
that

1443
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,280
adhd that's mercury autism

1444
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,319
mercury bipolar disorder mercury i said

1445
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,440
those already

1446
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,800
i'm going to say them again because

1454
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,680

why you got depersonalization meanwhile

1466
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,040
you're dealing with mercury and that's

1467
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,800
why it keeps on coming back and keeps on

1468
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,400

they've brought a condition like

1484
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,119
depression upon themselves

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,760
psychiatrist

1489
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,680
you know you're depressed you're going

1490
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,000
to need a therapist psychotherapist like

1491
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,280
a

1492
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,280
psychoanalyst you're going to need some

1493
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,839
kind of some kind of help

1494
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
yeah it's good to get help but it's end

1495
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,559
up it's on you

1496
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,440
like it's your fault it's your fault

1497
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,960
so the depression is your fault you're

1498
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,240
not thinking right you're not thinking

1499
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,000
positive your brain

1500
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,240
you know you don't know how to control

1501
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,880
your thoughts you don't know how to see

1502
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,440
things

1503
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,079
you must be just faulty you must just be

1504
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,400
you know

1505
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,599
not so great of a person that's what

1506
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,720
happens

1507
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,559
and it's all part of the mercury's blame

1508
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,559
the victim game because that's how it

1509
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,839
works and you got mercury

1510
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,760
talking for you creating that

1511
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,400
depersonalization that anxiety and that

1512
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,400
depression

1513
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,000
you got mercury talking for you creating

1514
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,000
depression

1515
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,839
and you're held hostage by mercury and

1516
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,160
nobody knows you'd be at your 50th

1517
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,319
doctor you'll be 75 years old now

1518
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,920
at your 100th doctor like why am i still

1519
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,880
depressed after all these years because

1520
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,800
no one's going to tell you it's mercury

1521
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,119
those depressive symptoms are the

1522
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,640
mercury speaking for a patient without

1523
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,720
her consent so here it is you got

1524
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,160
something inside of you which is a toxin

1525
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,000
and it's mercury and it's speaking for

1526
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,280
you without your consent

1527
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,520
and that's what's happening so you're

1528
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,200
depressed you're not feeling good

1529
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,640
emotionally mentally

1530
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,240
you got the mercury inside of you and

1531
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,160
it's kind of like speaking for you

1532
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,839
without your choice

1533
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,680
it's actually speaking for you without

1534
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,280
your consent that's how mercury works

1535
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,839
and that's how the mercury demon people

1536
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,680
love it

1537
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:49,440
originally so sometimes mercury moves

1538
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,760
past the hostage phase

1539
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,800
and takes someone out yeah there's

1540
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,720
people out there

1541
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,000
got a lot of mercury in their brain and

1542
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,520
it pushes them over

1543
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,559
the edge over the edge and that's really

1544
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,079
sad

1545
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,839
you know resulting in death by

1546
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,079
alzheimer's parkinson's dementia stroke

1547
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,160
it's that serious okay i'm reading out

1548
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,200
of new edition medical medium

1549
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,720
you guys mercury has injured or killed

1550
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,160
well over a billion people mercury

1551
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:23,760
has injured or killed and put

1552
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,520
over a billion people in an early

1553
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,160
grave right but hey there's no study on

1554
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,160
that

1555
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,839
but where's your study oh i don't know

1556
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,599
why a billion people died

1557
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,200
do you have a science study on that why

1558
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,720
a billion people died we don't know why

1559
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,760
a billion people died because they don't

1560
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,520
have a study yet

1561
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,520
on alzheimer's we don't know why people

1562
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,079
have alzheimer's the best medical

1563
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,800
technology

1564
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,640
in the world and we still don't know why

1565
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,559
is it the body attacking itself

1566
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,800
that must be it is it genes it's genes

1567
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:56,480
that's why the person has alzheimer's

1568
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,839
it's gene jeans i guess

1569
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,680
no one likes alzheimer's it's

1570
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,920
frightening terrible disease yet it's

1571
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,839
rapidly becoming common

1572
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,520
and it's a hundred percent mercury

1573
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,160
caused

1574
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,400
you heard that here first mercury is 100

1575
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,559
responsible for alzheimer's disease

1576
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,240
you will never in your lifetime hear the

1577
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,559
truth about that anywhere else

1578
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,000
unless a podcast doctor steals it from

1579
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,160
here and they have

1580
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,280
okay there's two podcast doctors out

1581
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,720
there

1582
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,359
that have stolen the information

1583
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,599
straight out of medical medium book one

1584
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,480
because there's no science and research

1585
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,079
behind it

1586
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,079
and it was published here first so they

1587
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,440
took it from here and then they talk

1588
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,720
about mercury now

1589
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,359
because people want to hear about

1590
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,640
mercury because millions of books sold

1591
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,319
around the planet

1592
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,760
and people want to know about mercury

1593
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,280
now because of the first book

1594
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,720
so then you got a couple of podcast

1595
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,480
doctors out there they're acting like

1596
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,559
they know something about mercury

1597
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,760
it's kind of funny you know they should

1598
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:54,000
cite where it comes from

1599
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,319
but they don't that's classic

1600
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,160
that's how egos work out there i want it

1601
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,520
cited so someone can heal

1602
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,559
they don't want to cite it because they

1603
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,319
want to look like they know what they're

1604
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,040
talking about

1605
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,319
um so let's get let's go into this a

1606
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,480
little bit more

1607
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:10,559
everyone has a different combination of

1608
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,359
toxic heavy metals inside their brains

1609
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,359
in alzheimer's aluminum is commonly

1610
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,880
present along with mercury

1611
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,960
when that's the case aluminum in the

1612
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,960
brain will play a role and contribute to

1613
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,119
the disease that said

1614
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,000
you can also have alzheimer's without

1615
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,160
aluminum

1616
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,760
whereas you can't have alzheimer's with

1617
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,480
aluminum without mercury so here's how

1618
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,520
it works

1619
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,280
aluminum by itself you guys right

1620
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,200
aluminum by itself can't cause

1621
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,559
alzheimer's it can't

1622
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,839
i mean it can mess you up don't get me

1623
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,079
wrong

1624
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,839
but you gotta have mercury in there too

1625
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,119
with the aluminum to create alzheimer's

1626
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,559
you can even have mercury without

1627
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,359
aluminum and create the alzheimer's

1628
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,799
right

1629
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:54,240
so that's important to know all right

1630
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:58,400
so let's go the medical industry

1631
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:01,200
will never blame mercury for the con

1632
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,079
for any condition any condition at all

1633
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,040
do you know why

1634
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,400
because the medical industry is guilty

1635
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,160
guilty

1636
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,480
of putin mercury in a ton of drugs

1637
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,480
man

1638
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,200
you will never ever in your lifetime

1639
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,720
ever see the blame

1640
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,359
from the industry on mercury you'll

1641
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,400
never see the industry blame mercury for

1642
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:29,599
anything the medical industry

1643
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,359
is so guilty they got so much blood on

1644
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,880
their hands with mercury

1645
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,920
it would be a cut a trillion is there

1646
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,440
something called it could be is

1647
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,799
katrilian real

1648
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,960
what's the biggest number you could ever

1649
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,480
think of what's the biggest number

1650
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,920
is wasn't it something like a trillion

1651
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,200
zeros or something is that the biggest

1652
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,280
number with like

1653
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,319
a nine after it like what's the biggest

1654
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,000
number out there because i'm not a

1655
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,440
mathematician

1656
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,760
but i can tell you this that lawsuit

1657
00:56:53,440 --> 00:57:00,720
would be that much money because you got

1658
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,200
a billion people dead because of mercury

1659
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,880
you got

1660
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:08,000
pharmaceuticals with mercury in them

1661
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,760
yeah keep those pharmaceuticals coming

1662
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,460
they all got mercury in them to some

1663
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,599
extent

1664
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:15,440
[Music]

1665
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,960
and so it's never going to get blamed

1666
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,240
for anything ever ever

1667
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:23,200
ever it's never going to ever get

1668
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,960
the blame instead some cosmetic doctor

1669
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,680
will come on the medical media platform

1670
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,000
and say

1671
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,960
there's no study that determines mercury

1672
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,160
has anything to do with alzheimer's

1673
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,680
that's what you'll get meanwhile just so

1674
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,119
yeah of course there isn't

1675
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,760
you're not going to put a study on

1676
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,920
something when literally the industry

1677
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,359
itself that's going to do the study has

1678
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,799
mercury and all their stuff and had

1679
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,480
mercury and all their stuff for so long

1680
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,280
including quicksilver going all the way

1681
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,000
back

1682
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,200
which i'll talk about in a second okay

1683
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,799
you're not

1684
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,040
fingers would be pointed into the

1685
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,079
direction of the mercury man

1686
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:02,240
whose true name is unknown

1687
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:05,680

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,280
continue to use mercury in their medical

1722
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,280
treatments involving children and adults

1723
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,400

dental amalgam fillings are another

1744
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,280
common source of exposure to mercury

1745
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,920
so many of us have had these silver

1746
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,000
fillings in our mouths

1747
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,160

01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,559
rotted out every one of my teeth and i

1753
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,240
should have implants like all the

1754
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,160
podcast doctors that are all keto and

1755
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,160
tell you not to eat fruit

1756
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,760
i should have like no teeth left from

1757
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,280
all these oranges i sucked down every

1758
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,119
single day i must have eaten

1759
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,720
thousands and thousands of oranges i

1760
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,599
probably ate a hundred oranges last week

1761
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,880
um but yeah the podcast doctors who

1762
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,319
don't eat any fruit and tell you not to

1763
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,079
even touch a lemon they're

1764
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:58,880
just got all the veneers and they got

1765
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,280
all the implants 24 7.

1766
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,280
all right

1767
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:06,799
this is fun reading the new edition

1768
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,240
medical meme new edition talking about

1769
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:11,280
dental work

1770
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,200
all right let's go so many of us had

1771
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,680
these silver fillings in our mouths and

1772
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,280
had

1773
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,200
hat and have had them at one point right

1774
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,720
it's becoming popular to get all

1775
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,040
mercury-based fillings removed at a

1776
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,040
holistic dentist office do you know why

1777
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,440
because of medical medium 35 years

1778
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,200
of teaching about those mercury fillings

1779
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,440
going all the way back

1780
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,920
to the 80s when everybody thought they

1781
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,720
were perfect people got their mouths

1782
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,119
filled with it

1783
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,839
dentists were on board there was nothing

1784
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,079
bad about

1785
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:44,720
it there was no science there's no

1786
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,680
science now still

1787
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,440
all right this may seem sensible like

1788
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,040
the right thing to do

1789
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,480
but you have to be very careful about

1790
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,720
the process getting

1791
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,559
all of your amalgam fillings removed at

1792
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,079
the same time can lead to an extremely

1793
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,280
high level of mercury exposure

1794
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,200
regardless

1795
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,200

scroll down on youtube and find that

1806
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,760
episode

1807
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,760
see dr fon um

1808
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,599
so yeah so let's go on this a little bit

1809
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,280
more the exposure can put a heavy load

1810
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,799
on the immune system and also feed

1811
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,640
viruses so when you get your

1812
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,319
your mercury fillings out it can feed

1813
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,839
viruses all of a sudden boom you got

1814
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,400
extra mercury in there and look that can

1815
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,599
happen but

1816
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,440
it's what the heavy metal detox

1817
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,880
smoothies for right you can always ask

1818
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,079
your doctor if that's right for you but

1819
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,839
it's what i would recommend

1820
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,599
recommend my friends and family it's in

1821
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:53,200
the books it's in the book

1822
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,559
got the virus that feeds off of mercury

1823
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,319
when the mercury escapes and gets out

1824
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,640
okay and then when you get all of those

1825
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,880
mercury fillings at once then the

1826
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,160
bloodstream fills up and then all of a

1827
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,039
sudden now if you've got

1828
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,240
viral issues it can go into a massive

1829
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,440
kill-off

1830
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,280
of not the virus but a massive kill-off

1831
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,200
of your red blood count

1832
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,799
could lose your red blood count in a

1833
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,230
shot getting all your mercury fillings

1834
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,280
removed

1835
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:24,960
[Music]

1836
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,640
so the exposure is a trigger from those

1837
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,160
getting all those out it can trigger off

1838
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,000
any health conditions whether existing

1839
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,720
ones that flare up are new ones that

1840
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,200
develop from a dormant virus that was

1841
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,440
not

1842
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,960
active and then became active and then

1843
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,359
that's the re-ignition

1844
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,000
that's the re-ignition of epstein-barr

1845
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,559
okay

1846
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,160
the reigniting of it people are getting

1847
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,280
tested for that now because of medical

1848
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,520
medium books like this one

1849
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,920
anyway so i know people who have had 10

1850
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:57,039
fillings dug out at once and as a result

1851
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,480
their blood platelets dropped so low

1852
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,319
that they almost died it's best to

1853
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,119
remove metal fillings only when an

1854
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:08,160
individual tooth requires it

1855
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,799
hear that such as if the filling becomes

1856
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,960
unstable or the tooth is damaged

1857
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,920
if your teeth and fillings are all in

1858
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,520
good order

1859
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,200
and you're still anxious to have the

1860
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,160
amalgams removed then get

1861
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,559
only one taken out at a time schedule at

1862
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,799
least a month between each removal

1863
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,280
so you so you don't trigger that viral

1864
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:30,000
load and get yourself sick

1865
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,680
if you're ready if you already had all

1866
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,440
your metal fillings removed then it's

1867
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:37,359
time to do some clean up

1868
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,680
baby some clean up protect yourself

1869
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:42,079
and if you get new cavities select the

1870
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,680
safest filling option available and make

1871
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,280
sure it doesn't contain mercury know

1872
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,440
that anything is better than a filling

1873
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,079
that contains mercury

1874
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,280
so it's information on the mercury man

1875
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,880
it's just a little bit there's a lot

1876
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,079
more in here which is really cool

1877
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,160
