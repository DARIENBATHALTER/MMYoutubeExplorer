155
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,120
because people with digestive problems

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
protein at all

263
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
very important to know okay you get

264
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
neurological symptoms and you get

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080

rosacea

271
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
it's imperative you understand how that

272
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,440
works

273
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,959
where you get sick and if someone says

274
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,600

275
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,680
as if that's some kind of answer or some

276
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
kind of solution

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,519
to why you're sick like it's a head

278
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,000
scratcher right there

that's a head scratcher uh so is a

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
protein

382
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
okay so let's go into the coins let's

383
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,440
talk about it a little bit

384
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
let's do that

385
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
people always worry about like getting

386
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
enough

387
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
of the food rainbow right getting enough

388
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
of food rainbow

389
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
on the mono eating cleanse the larger

390
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,240
amounts you're eating of healing foods

391
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,880
remember this you're eating a larger

392
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,480
amount

393
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,200
of healing foods okay

394
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
such as papaya in the way your body

395
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
benefits from that

396
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,279
supersedes the need for variety

397
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,720
keep that in mind i'm a big believer in

398
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,959
variety for sure but when we're healing

399
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,560
certain problems and cleansing certain

400
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,560
things going on in the body

401
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,680
simplicity helps us heal

402
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,600
and when we're doing larger amounts of a

403
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,440
medicinal food

404
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,360
that heals us in special ways

405
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,959
we're changing our body's environment

406
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
for the positive we're getting rid of

407
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
the poisons we're easing up the liver

408
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,800
the liver doesn't have to produce all

409
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,000
this bile your stomach doesn't blow out

410
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,320
all its hydrochloric acid and your

411
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
adrenals

412
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
have a chance to heal right your

413
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,040
adrenals have a chance

414
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,959
all these things matter okay so

415
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,120
the larger amounts you're eating you

416
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320

that

you're only getting tiny amounts of each

443
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
food when people are trying to get that

444
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
rainbow going

445
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,120
you're only getting tiny amounts one

446
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,519
little piece of tomato in your salad

447
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
oh i got a little red in there there's a

448
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,079
little tomato in my salad i got a little

449
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
red

450
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,160
it's not enough you have to eat a few

451
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,920
tomatoes like in this medical medium

452
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
spinach soup right when you're not doing

453
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
the mono cleanse

454
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
and you're doing the medical medium

455
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,880
spinach soup you're getting like

456
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
two three bigger sized tomatoes in there

457
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,839
but you eat a little salad and you got a

458
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,279
little piece of tomato you think you're

459
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
doing yourself good

460
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
that's the trick out of that whole

461
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,519
rainbow thing right

462
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,160
a couple of cucumber pieces versus

463
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,079
actually making cucumber noodles

464
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,639
or juicing some cucumbers and making

465
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,199
some cucumber juice right

466
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
see the difference the power the power

467
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,399
difference right there

468
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
so people are like well no i had some

469
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
cucumber i had a salad with a little

470
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,040
tomato i got a check

471
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,839
check covered got a little piece of

472
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,880
tomato

473
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,000
check covered uh no check

474
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,680
no check me you got screwed over by

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,199
information out there

476
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,959
because it takes more than a little

477
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
piece of tomato and a little couple

478
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,320
little slices of cucumber

479
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,920
it does so when we span out the rainbow

480
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
too much and we're all trying to

481
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
you know a little bit of this little bit

482
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
of that little bit little bit of this

483
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
it's not enough to do anything keep that

484
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,920
in mind right

485
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,000
so a few leaves of mixed greens

486
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,160
isn't enough is it enough

487
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
well it may give you the full spectrum

488
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,959
it's not like eating the whole bowl of

489
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
heirloom

490
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,639
tomatoes you guys it's not like

491
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,680
having a whole head of cauliflower in

492
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,279
one sitting

493
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,319
instead you're spreading out your

494
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,319
nutrients in these little pieces of food

495
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
in some cases that can work in the end

496
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,760
if your digestion isn't troubled either

497
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,919
too a lot of people

498
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,600
their digestion isn't tanked yet right

499
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
and they can just like throw any

500
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,439
abomination they want in there fried

501
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,839
this fry that or just whatever

502
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
you know bake this oils and all this

503
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,079
stuff

504
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,439
but you know it's important to know so

505
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,919
um

506
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,520
look ten i gotta tell you something too

507
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,480
we're gonna go into quantities in a

508
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,559
second i just wanna finish this up

509
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,919
all right now the bottom line is

510
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,360
another thing too when people when they

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,360
eat avocado they might have in their

512
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,240
salad a sliver of avocado

513
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
and orange slice right and you know in

514
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
their food somewhere and it you know or

515
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
they have something that's made with

516
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,200
all the stuff and thrown on chicken

517
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,640
breasts right the bottom line

518
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,559
bottom line is how do you get better

519
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
if you're not using enough of a

520
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
medicinal food

521
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
if someone only eats a couple of bites

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
of banana every three days

523
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,880
or a couple of bites of banana every

524
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,679
week you're not getting enough there's

525
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
you can't get enough to do what you need

526
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,039
to do to heal

527
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,760
and this is one of the traps right now

528
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,919
in alternative medicine by the way

529
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,760
really important information right there

530
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,200
that alone is so critical

531
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,120
um quantities let's go into that a

532
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,720
little bit

533
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,480
while we can

534
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
eight bananas might not be enough for

535
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,919
somebody definitely not ten bananas

536
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,039
might not be enough for somebody on this

537
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,240
mono cleanse

538
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,960
okay the bananas could be small these

539
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,880
bananas

540
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,960
are bigger all right these bananas are

541
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,799
these are big bananas right here someone

542
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
could have smaller bananas

543
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,240
medium-sized bananas you don't want to

544
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,760
starve yourself you

545
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,200
want to eat enough so important lunell

546
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,480
says quantity matters

547
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,440
as much as quality exactly let's talk

548
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
about how to do it

549
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,799
let's go let's get working we got work

550
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,799
to do

551
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,240
we do we do let's get on it so

552
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,640
first things first let me run a little

553
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
celery juice let's get that going right

554
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,120
now

555
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,960
you guys don't mind first and foremost

556
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
did you guys get your celery juice you

557
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
need the mineral salts

558
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,200
that's a big deal all in its own you

559
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,919
have to have the mineral salts

560
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
very important

561
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
so i got some fresh washed celery right

562
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
here

563
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,160
one of the reasons why people heal with

564
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
celery juice is because

565
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
of the mineral salts

566
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,120
it's a complete electrolyte

567
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,480
you can be somebody with a whole rainbow

568
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,440
of foods

569
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,440
you you know you got a a wide palette

570
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,120
you're eccentric can i have this

571
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,280
you're in a you know you're in a juice

572
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
bar you're in a restaurant a vegan

573
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,240
restaurant and you're like

574
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,679
yeah can i have that i say

575
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,080
a little bit of this and a little juice

576
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
on the side and you're not getting a

577
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,200
complete electrolyte

578
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
the reason why people heal is one of the

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,840
reasons is that complete electrolyte

580
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
which juicer do i use mary this is the

581
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,760
mm-900 hds

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,640
it has to be that model if you want the

583
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,760
results

584
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,159
as far as saving money

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,039
specifically and

592
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,520
it's the celery juicer and it does other

593
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,520
stuff too

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
with them on this and it's my favorite

598
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,159
juicer i've ever

599
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:18,320
used so

600
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
what this does is it gives you a chance

601
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,360
to cleanse

602
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,880
and heal it gives your body a rest

603
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,679
like no other that's what the mono

604
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,840
cleanse does

605
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,840
it gives your body a rest

606
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
when you're healing and cleansing you

607
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,120
may

608
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,520
rest more you may feel like you need to

609
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
rest

610
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,559
more your adrenals aren't on fire

611
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,240
when you're doing this keep that in mind

612
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,919
your adrenals aren't on fire every day

613
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,320
we stress our adrenals out it's not just

614
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
the world stressing them out we eat in a

615
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,080
way

616
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,760
that trashes our adrenals you guys this

617
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,799
is so important

618
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,559
when you're mono cleansing right

619
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
doing the mono cleanse

620
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
medical medium mono cleanse i have to

621
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
say medical medium because someone's

622
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,640
gonna be like

623
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,480
yeah i'm eating nothing but grapes for a

624
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
month and they just rip their guts apart

625
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,850
and they actually hurt themselves versus

626
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
help themselves

627
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,960
[Music]

628
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,640
the medical medium mono cleanse allows

629
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,520
for your adrenals to not

630
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,520
have to get overworked so you might get

631
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,960
tired

632
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,799
because you're healing that's how it

633
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,919
works

634
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,880
your body's getting a break you may need

635
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,000
to rest

636
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,799
or take a nap

637
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
all of this is important to know so that

638
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,840
in the future

639
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you'll have more energy and more

640
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,039
strength

641
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,520
see how that works you're giving your

642
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,120
body

643
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,799
a chance to heal so that in the future

644
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,320
you're going to have more strength and

645
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
more adrenal power

646
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,679
right every bit everybody every day is

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,880
trashing their adrenals they don't know

648
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
it but they are

649
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
they're tanking fats every day because

650
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,120
everybody's on a high fat diet

651
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:25,520
which tires out the adrenals

652
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,880
they're on caffeine they're on coffee

653
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,320
green tea matcha tea whatever chocolate

654
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,280
and they've got their adrenals

655
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,840
overworked every single day

656
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
and then they're intermittent fasting

657
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,480
when things get so out of control

658
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,559
they intermittent fast and then they're

659
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
on adrenaline once again because now

660
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,030
they're not eating

661
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,400
so their adrenals are pumping right

662
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,600
[Music]

663
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,400
what this does is it it tells your body

664
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,559
we're healing it tells your body we're

665
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
taking a break

666
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,200
see how important that is you may get a

667
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,480
little tired you may need to rest

668
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,960
you have poisons and toxins coming out

669
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,039
into the bloodstream to be urinated out

670
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
and eliminated out

671
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,840
your blood is thinning you're getting

672
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,640
rid of all the fat in your blood

673
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,200
your heart's getting a break and so what

674
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,360
happens

675
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,960
is when your heart's getting a break and

676
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
your adrenals are getting a break your

677
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,080
heart doesn't have to pump so hard

678
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,080
all these things allow for you to heal

679
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
hold on how are adrenals pumping

680
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,880
something's blocking that word oh during

681
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
an intermittent fast so hold this on

682
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,279
tick tock

683
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,679
hold on how are adrenals pumping during

684
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,440
intermittent fast

685
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
intermittent fast doesn't doesn't give

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
you glucose so you're not running on any

687
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,480
glucose adrenaline has to replace the

688
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,919
glucose that's why

689
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
so here's how it works right

690
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
you're intermittent fasting the wrong

691
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,279
way that's what everybody does

692
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,279
okay because they're not getting their

693
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,720
celery juice keeping those mineral salts

694
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,080
going in there they're not getting their

695
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,559
lemon water they're not having

696
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,919
some fruit they're not doing that so

697
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
intermittent fasting means they're

698
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,960
holding

699
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,799
withholding from food right when you

700
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
withhold for fruit from food

701
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,960
past a couple of hours you start running

702
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,200
on adrenaline because you ran out of

703
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,799
glucose your glucose is gone

704
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
your glucose just disappears out of the

705
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080
bloodstream because you're now

706
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
you're not giving yourself any glucose

707
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,440
right you're not giving yourself any

708
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
carbohydrates or blood sugar your blood

709
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,159
sugar is just

710
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,679
relying now on adrenaline so when you

711
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,279
intermittent fast you're just off of

712
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,799
adrenaline so you're on a high you're

713
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,919
like wow this intermittent fasting

714
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,159
thing's working for me

715
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,080
and all that does is take you to a place

716
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,520
of trashing your adrenals later on

717
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,360
that's how it works you don't think no

718
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
one intermittent fasted before and just

719
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,320
i mean yeah it's been around and it

720
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,320
crashes people

721
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,919
right now it's popular because people

722
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,279
are used to bombarding themselves with

723
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,120
so much food in the morning

724
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,279
that when they take a digestive break

725
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,000
for a little while they pick up

726
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,880
but you trash your adrenals at the same

727
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
time

728
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
so intermittent fasting totally wipes

729
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
the adrenals out okay and that's how it

730
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
works

731
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
believe it or not that's just the way

732
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,520
the body the body runs

733
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,720
if you don't have glucose you run on

734
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,400
adrenaline

735
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,400
it's one or the other glucose or

736
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,760
adrenaline you run out of glucose

737
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,720
because you're intermittent fasting and

738
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
you stop eating

739
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
then you better be running on something

740
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
and guess what it is it's adrenaline it

741
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,559
takes

742
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,000
place of glucose that's how the body

743
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,559
works the more you

744
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
run out of glucose the more adrenaline

745
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,200
rises

746
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
the more adrenaline epinephrine is

747
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
released more epinephrine's released and

748
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
more epinephrine is released and it

749
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,440

you how many juicers

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,360
to buy in the sense where it paid for

764
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,159
itself over and over and over again i

765
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
could have bought

766
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,840
50 juicers already with the money saved

767
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,360
that's how incredible that is it's the

768
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
only juicer that pays for itself by the

769
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,360
way

770
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,360

779
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,919
amazing and vagus nerve issues too

780
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,279
absolutely healing the vagus nerve

781
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,559
gentle glucose-rich mineral-rich

782
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,880
foods easy on the digestion allows the

783
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,440
vagus nerve to do some healing

784
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
love it love it love it so great so

785
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
great

786
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,279
got my celery juice 16 to 32 ounces okay

787
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,919
always strain your celery juice

788
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,440
keep that in mind gotta strain it get

789
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,559
the pulp get the fiber

790
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,320
out make sure it's straight celery juice

791
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,480
really important to know okay all right

792
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,000
what celery juice does for us is it

793
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
helps to stop

794
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
the cravings really important right

795
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,600
there on its own

796
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,760
helps to kill the cravings there's only

797
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,399
a little bit of glucose and celery not a

798
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
lot

799
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,679
but the point is there's a lot of

800
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,919
mineral salts right

801
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,360
there's a difference between salt itself

802
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
and then what's in celery

803
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,880
the sodium cluster salts the trace

804
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,159
minerals and celery juice do a whole

805
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
different thing

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,200

or getting enough food so you're not

935
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,240
missing out and you buy two tiny little

936
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,679
papayas

937
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,519
and now you're just home and you're like

938
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,760
how am i going to do this let's start

939
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,039
with the

940
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
pie here so

941
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,200
just going to open up this washer and

942
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:56,799
grab some balls

943
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,919
right so i'm going to scoop the seeds

944
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,799
out of this papaya as you guys can see

945
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,000
right now you can eat papaya seeds but

946
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,320
they're very spicy

947
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,120
and they're very strong right and when

948
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,639
you're mono

949
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,480
eating it might not be something you

950
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,200
want to do you might not want to eat

951
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,879
them they're very

952
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,960
peppery very very bitey

953
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:24,320
okay very spicy

954
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,320
removing the um seeds right there

955
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,000
so you got a couple of different options

956
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,679
you could just do this

957
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,200
you're doing the mono cleanse just take

958
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,200
a spoon right

959
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,359
and you can eat it so like that another

960
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,480
way here

961
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,480
is i'm going to cut it in pieces

962
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,000
all right little squares and stuff i'm

963
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,399
gonna make

964
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,079
a papaya bowl do that now

965
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,720
now this isn't a lot of food

966
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,119
right so because it's not a lot of

967
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,640
calories

968
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,320
believe it or not people are afraid of

969
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
bananas they think it's so much sugar

970
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,400
there's so many calories in there

971
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,280
peanut butter's got the calories people

972
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,280
don't realize that

973
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,720
it's under a different name it's under

974
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,400
fat

975
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,320
so somebody's gonna be like that's not a

976
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,240
calorie fat's not a calorie

977
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,880
fat's fat yeah the system is rigged

978
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,160
so we think that the fat is just really

979
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
doesn't really

980
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
offer anything like that but what it

981
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,240
does is the fat makes you fat

982
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,480
there's a reason for that fat makes you

983
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,480
fat

984
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,560
why is watermelon making me super

985
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
bloated does that mean i have

986
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,440
sibo or candida so

987
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,280
a couple of things with watermelon is i

988
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
love a look i love watermelon it's a

989
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,720
cleansing healing food i love

990
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,920
melons in the 369 cleanse the 369

991
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,960
advanced cleanse you'll see

992
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,680
melons on the ninth day right

993
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,920
but what happens is a lot of people have

994
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,079
digestive problems of all kinds

995
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,079
they'll have things going on with their

996
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,880
digestion you know that that anything

997
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,800
they'll have

998
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,400
um they'll have sibo they'll have h

999
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,200
pylori they'll have

1000
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,079
uh pockets in their colon they'll have

1001
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
narrowing

1002
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,480
in their intestinal tract so they'll

1003
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,800
have all these different issues

1004
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,960
they'll have low low hydrochloric acid

1005
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,880
because their stomach glands are burnt

1006
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,079
big thing about bloating and you should

1007
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,720
learn about it in here

1008
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
honestly if you're bloating for any

1009
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,359
reason you should have this book so you

1010
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,240
can look in the bloating section and

1011
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,119
work on

1012
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,320
fixing what's going on inside of there

1013
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
you don't have that book you

1014
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,440
i mean you really should people got the

1015
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
blown out

1016
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,119
gastric lands inside the stomach so the

1017
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
gastric lamps inside the stomach are

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,359
blown out

1019
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,440
right watermelon is very healing

1020
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,000
very very cleansing right

1021
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,800
but what happens is because it's so

1022
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,640
cleansing

1023
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:02,560
in its own way it's gonna start flushing

1024
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,800
all kinds of crap you got on that lining

1025
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,839
see so inside here

1026
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
you're gonna have

1027
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,520
inside your colon right in there okay

1028
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,480
okay right inside your colon

1029
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
you're gonna have all this debris and so

1030
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
now you're like well i'm gonna do a

1031
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,359
whole bunch of watermelon let me do that

1032
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,560
let me do a whole bunch of watermelon

1033
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,680
and as you're doing that

1034
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,960
you're gonna be like flushing

1035
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,720
flushing and flush it and then you're

1036
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,760
not going to be used to

1037
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,560
uprooting all that that protein that's

1038
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,720
rancid

1039
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,079
that's sticking all on the linings

1040
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,079
you're not going to be used to

1041
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,000
all that putrified fat that's stuck

1042
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,280
in the linings from years and years and

1043
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,119
years of eating that

1044
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,000
so then you you're gonna you're gonna

1045
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,920
get kind of upset about watermelon

1046
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,320
we get upset there's other cleansing

1047
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,280
foods we might get upset at right

1048
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,560
so we'll punish these foods during that

1049
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
watermelon

1050
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,880
making me bloated i'm not saying you're

1051
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,520
like you know freaking out but

1052
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,240
you know darn that cleansing food it's

1053
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,359
you know darn that celery juice

1054
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,880
but really it's from years and years

1055
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,359
of being fed garbage that's what it is

1056
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,000
and and the whole thing is you must

1057
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,480
already

1058
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,960
had uploading issues somewhere this

1059
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,320
isn't the first time you blowed it

1060
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,079
and if you're dealing with sibo or

1061
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,040
anything else you already have a

1062
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,480
bloating issue

1063
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,880
right so it's not like you've never

1064
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,480
bloated before you're eating your pizzas

1065
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,320
and never bloated you're eating your

1066
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,680
nachos and never bloated you're eating

1067
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,960
your bean burgers never bloated you're

1068
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,480
eating your chicken and

1069
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,920
rice and never bloated your bread and

1070
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
never bloated your muffins and never

1071
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,640
bloated your bagels had never bloated

1072
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
so you you're obviously bloating it's

1073
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,599
not like you had watermelon for the

1074
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,720
first time in your bloating

1075
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,599
but watermelon watermelon is a

1076
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,320
powerful cleanser too though once you

1077
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,160
start uprooting all that crap

1078
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,839
you'll have a storm in there you'll

1079
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,800
have a shitstorm in there

1080
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,040
so in the medical medium mono cleanse

1081
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,119
watermelon isn't recommended

1082
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,760
okay it doesn't mean you can't use

1083
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,160
watermelon it's a very healing food

1084
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
it's on the cover of the book right here

1085
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,400
right

1086
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,240
because it's an extremely healing food

1087
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,760
i've gotten a lot of people recovered

1088
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,800
using melons

1089
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,359
so let's let's minus the watermelon

1090
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,560
let's move into honeydew melons

1091
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,400
cantaloupes right so

1092
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,800
for sensitive people i've had them on

1093
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,240
melons i've had them on cantaloupes

1094
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,640
all right and i've used it but

1095
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,079
i'm saying in general when you want to

1096
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
do something when if you have anything

1097
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,119
going on with your intestinal tract when

1098
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,000
you've got crohn's colitis and you've

1099
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,000
got

1100
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,920
ibs and you've got sibo and you've got

1101
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,480
all these other problems i like

1102
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,839
what's in the book for mono eating which

1103
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,560
is your papaya

1104
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,839
and your banana your lettuces your

1105
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,319
gentle lettuces

1106
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,200
your celery juice your lemon water

1107
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,640
that's what i

1108
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,560
like right there and there's some people

1109
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,640
that got pretty strong guts still

1110
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,839
you know they're their hydrochloric acid

1111
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,520
is still strong

1112
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,520
their guts aren't filled with too much

1113
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,280
putrefied stuff and they're taking the

1114
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,800
watermelon every day it's a great tool

1115
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,200
it's a great tool but i'm saying

1116
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,040
it's not highly recommended for the mono

1117
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,760
eating cleanse

1118
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,440
but yet i love melons and i love the

1119
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,119
honeydews and the cantaloupes and the

1120
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,960
crenshaws and all those

1121
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,160
and i love those for the 369 last day

1122
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,520
anyway but if you're gonna go

1123
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,119
long term on the melon long term

1124
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,720
like if you ever choose to do something

1125
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,720
like that you go watermelon

1126
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,400
you're doing a watermelon every day long

1127
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,079
term i recommend you make sure you get

1128
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,680
that celery juice in every single day

1129
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,000
because you need those mineral salts

1130
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,520
that's what i recommend okay i also

1131
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,160
recommend

1132
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,440
that you should if you are doing it you

1133
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,920
should be pretty

1134
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,680
hardy when you do it because you might

1135
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
bump into walls eventually because

1136
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,880
there's not

1137
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,000
there's not enough calories in most of

1138
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,480
the watermelons that are

1139
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,200
out there some watermelons around the

1140
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,680
world

1141
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,599
have the caloric they have that caloric

1142
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,520
nature to it they got the calories

1143
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,280
most watermelons that we walk in and

1144
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
just stumble into a store and we grab

1145
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,839
one

1146
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,040
not a lot of calories in those some of

1147
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,040
those aren't like that you'll see

1148
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
they're kind of whitish inside

1149
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,720
they're a little pale inside they're not

1150
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,599
deep red with

1151
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,599
all that sugar and glucose so that's

1152
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,040
another mistake too you just go okay i'm

1153
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,160
gonna do watermelon cleanse you grab a

1154
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,359
watermelon from the store and that

1155
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
watermelon doesn't have a lot of

1156
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,319
calories because it's not like somebody

1157
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
else's watermelon somewhere else in the

1158
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,040
world

1159
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,960
where it's deep rich red all the seeds

1160
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,359
in there just keep in mind that that

1161
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,000
that's just some of the some of the

1162
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,520
things that just to look out for

1163
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,920
but you notice the medical medium

1164
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,520
cleanse is

1165
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,240
mono cleanse is based with based out of

1166
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,240
a

1167
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,280
papaya so we're doing the papaya right

1168
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
here okay

1169
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,040
and what we do is you can do you take

1170
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,640
the banana

1171
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,119
chop it up throw it on top of the papaya

1172
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,640
if you're gonna do the papaya banana one

1173
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,160
so if you're gonna mix them and do i

1174
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,480
like the papaya banana

1175
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,240
together that's one i really like but i

1176
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,000
also like when you know

1177
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
many times i've had to recommend for

1178
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,920
people to do the banana one

1179
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,520
just the banana and lettuce to recover

1180
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,800
them and get them better and stronger

1181
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,960
and healthier

1182
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,119
um so you can just literally go this

1183
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,680
route right here

1184
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,400
grab a fork and now you're having your

1185
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:37,359
banana pieces

1186
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,359
so good having your papaya piece

1187
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,960
blending papaya is actually one of my

1188
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,319
favorite too here's another thing

1189
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,960
take your lettuce leaf right

1190
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,319
put your banana pieces here put some

1191
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,200
papaya pieces in your

1192
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:58,880
your lettuce leaf right and then you got

1193
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:02,000
your lettuce papaya banana

1194
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,000
that's not a lot of food

1195
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
it's one banana and a half of a large

1196
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,720
papaya

1197
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,200
it's not a lot of food keep that in mind

1198
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,480
so

1199
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,520
you may need a whole bunch of these from

1200
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,960
morning till night okay if you're really

1201
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,079
really hungry like you're hitting the

1202
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,079
wall you're hungry

1203
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,839
you're craving you're hungry if you're

1204
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,599
only three bananas in

1205
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,119
half a papaya in and it's four o'clock

1206
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,800
in the afternoon and you're like hitting

1207
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,920
you're just like

1208
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,440
you want to scream then you know

1209
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,359
you need some more so keep that in mind

1210
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,079
how it works very important information

1211
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,319
right here

1212
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,160
all right all right we got that

1213
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,520
that was fun let's go into the next part

1214
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,280
so we need to do

1215
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,040
i want to blend up papaya real quick

1216
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,720
i know i did that yesterday but it's

1217
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,240
important to do it again and show

1218
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,359
everybody because

1219
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,400
it's it's such a great tool

1220
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:09,839
so let's get some papaya in here do a

1221
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:09,839
little blend up real quick

1222
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,000
so we're getting some papaya in here

1223
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,319
right here

1224
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,720
and we're gonna do just a quick papaya

1225
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,720
blend

1226
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,880
right now you can you can scoop right

1227
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,240
down to the skins of your papayas like

1228
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,000
right to this you know inner rind

1229
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,839
okay keep that in mind you can totally

1230
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,839
do that

1231
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,839
do a quick little blend

1232
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:50,960
this is probably one of my favorite ways

1233
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:53,920
of doing it

1234
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:58,400
and i'll give you a recap you guys 16 to

1235
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,200
32 ounces of lemon water upon waking

1236
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,079
okay i i think 32 ounces of lemon water

1237
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,760
is smart even if you use a half a lemon

1238
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,160
right then you move on 15-30 minutes

1239
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,000
later you're on your celery juice

1240
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,960
right you got that

1241
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,560
and then you're moving on to whatever

1242
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,599
food choice you have you don't have to

1243
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,280
have your lettuce

1244
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
in the morning you could save that for

1245
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,520
lunch your lunch version

1246
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,920
you can save it for the end of the day

1247
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,160
version right

1248
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,160
and

1249
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,880
so i got some papaya that's blended

1250
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,079
fun fun fun

1251
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,119
all right and what i like to do i'm just

1252
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,839
going to move this out of the way real

1253
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,839
quick

1254
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,359
what i like to do is peel back a banana

1255
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,359
like this

1256
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:04,550
i like to cut in pieces

1257
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,550
[Music]

1258
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,720
and anyway

1259
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,520
i got it right there in the in the the

1260
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,480
cut pieces

1261
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,200
in the bowl of papaya so what i like to

1262
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,280
do is dip

1263
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,440
it so i take the piece of banana and dip

1264
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,440
it

1265
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,240
don't knock it till you try it it's that

1266
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
good

1267
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,760
like if you were here right now and i

1268
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,160
was like

1269
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,160
dude just dip it in there

1270
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,079
don't knock it to your stripe that's

1271
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,079
incredible

1272
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,520
but then again you could be somebody

1273
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,599
that's so addicted

1274
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,119
to all the bad stuff you don't know what

1275
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,640
you're tasting

1276
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,640
and that's what i love about the mono

1277
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,920
cleanse it brings you

1278
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,839
back around so that you might be able to

1279
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,240
detect

1280
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,160
poison in all your food

1281
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,760
because that's what happens everybody's

1282
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,200
poisoning themselves

1283
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,680
they're poisoning themselves a cow's

1284
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,680
milk poisoning themselves with

1285
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,359
with soy they're poisoning themselves

1286
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,480
with caffeine they're poisoning

1287
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,079
themselves with all kinds of different

1288
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,440
things apple cider vinegar all kinds of

1289
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,960
stuff vinegar and all their food they're

1290
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,480
just poisoning themselves

1291
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,240
and what happens is when you remove

1292
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,960
all the poison right and you keep it

1293
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,920
plain and simple you guys

1294
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,559
and you get used to that simplicity and

1295
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,119
then your body reorganizes

1296
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,920
okay your taste buds reorganize your

1297
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,400
your central

1298
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,440
nervous system connects to the taste

1299
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,319
buds right

1300
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,720
your cranial nerves go to the taste buds

1301
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,920
your cranial nerves

1302
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,040
go to all those nerves that that are

1303
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,520
there for your senses

1304
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,640
and all of a sudden everything starts

1305
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,839
changing

1306
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,440
because you're getting away from the

1307
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,880
poisons for a little bit because

1308
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,319
everybody's they're just poisoning

1309
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
themselves that's what they're taught to

1310
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,119
do

1311
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,920
right and once you're doing this you get

1312
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,280
used to it

1313
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,920
and you do this long enough and then you

1314
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,760
go to

1315
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,960
back to all that poison you're used to

1316
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,040
eating

1317
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,240
right you go back to all the poison now

1318
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,839
you're on the caffeine

1319
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,000
now you're on the butter and your cheese

1320
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,400
and everything else you go back to it

1321
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,839
and the vinegar and everything and the

1322
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,480
kombucha tea

1323
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,160
straight poison once you go back to all

1324
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,920
that you'll be like what

1325
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,599
and that's why this is critical to

1326
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,559
realign things to get

1327
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,760
you back to where you're supposed to be

1328
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,480
to be able to heal

1329
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,480
too all right so let's keep it moving

right okay you're moving on to some of

1376
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,880
your options you could do banana papaya

1377
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,800
you can do papaya

1378
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,800
all right we're doing a potato and

1379
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,359
lettuce option let's head there now

1380
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,839
okay pick the one you want you can drink

1381
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,000
pure

1382
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,920
cucumber juice at the end of the day you

1383
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,160
can drink celery juice twice

1384
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,760
morning and end of the day keep the salt

1385
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,000
keep the seasonings like i'm saying keep

1386
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,040
all

1387
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,119
that out and drink approximately

1388
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,000
a liter of water throughout the day you

1389
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,119
can add lemon to that water too

1390
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,319
all right back on track okay let's mash

1391
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,240
some potatoes

1392
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,680
now you can put the potatoes in a food

1393
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,920
processor right

1394
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,119
i wouldn't put them in a blender i

1395
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,119
wouldn't

1396
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,480
i wouldn't put a potato in a blender i

1397
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,720
don't know i don't think that i don't

1398
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,720
think that would be a smart thing to do

1399
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,559
right so i'm just mashing up these

1400
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,880
potatoes

1401
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,720
so i'm doing some mashed potatoes now i

1402
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,520
get it everybody wants salt they want

1403
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,400
butter

1404
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,839
they want cheese in here right that's

1405
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,079
that's what everybody wants

1406
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:27,839
and remember this is plain

1407
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,160
this is plain for reason

1408
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:33,280
this is about sacrificing a little

1409
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:37,680
without having a sacrifice

1410
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,800
this is just as healing

1411
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:44,000
as the other medical medium cleanses

1412
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,000
it does different things okay

1413
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,119
most importantly really gives your

1414
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,400
digestive system

1415
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,240
a total break which is key

1416
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,359
you give your digestive system a break

1417
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,200
right i left the skins on this potato

1418
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,440
you can take the skins off if you really

1419
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,000
wanted to you don't have to

1420
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,559
you're getting rid of addictions you

1421
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,800

you're rebuilding your hcl

1425
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,880
you're rebuilding your hcl

1426
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,760
what i like to do is put lemon in these

1427
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,760
mashed potatoes

1428
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:29,280
so dropping some lemon in

1429
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,839
here we go we're day two the medical

1430
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,400
medium mono cleanse

1431
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,240
challenge are you guys doing it

1432
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,680
would love to know i know you guys are

1433
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,839
many of you guys are

1434
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,839
right

1435
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,559
so let's just mash these up a little bit

1436
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
more

1437
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,680
all right we got mashed potatoes right

1438
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,680
here

1439
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,680
now i'm gonna put these in a small bowl

1440
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,680
let's do that

1441
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,000
now you don't have to have four potatoes

1442
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,119
worth at once

1443
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,280
you can span those out okay some people

1444
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,040
are gonna want four potatoes

1445
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,200
some people are gonna want more

1446
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,680
throughout the day some people less

1447
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,359
you might have a small stomach and

1448
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,319
you're not used to stretching your

1449
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,720
stomach

1450
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,240
because you're used to eating dense fats

1451
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,480
small portions of dense

1452
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,599
fat right a lot of people do that

1453
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,920
they're used to eating

1454
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,839
pieces of meat little pieces of chicken

1455
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,119
and they get all their calories

1456
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:13,280
from all dense fats so their stomach

1457
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,559
isn't stretched

1458
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,800
our stomach isn't um it's it's

1459
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,720
shrunk right a lot of people have so

1460
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,119
they'll eat like a part of a banana and

1461
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,760
feel

1462
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,760
full they'll eat like half a banana and

1463
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,920
feel like well that was too much food

1464
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,920
but you can eat more when it comes down

1465
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,680
to the mono cleanse okay

1466
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,760
you can eat more so that's important so

1467
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,599
this is a mashed potato right here

1468
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,440
what i like about the mashed potato you

1469
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,359
could add more lemon to it too i added

1470
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,640
some lemon

1471
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,760
okay and

1472
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,920
put a little bit more lemon in there

1473
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,160
there's no butter in here there's no fat

1474
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,319
in these mashed potatoes

1475
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,760
there's a reason for that to save your

1476
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,160
liver you guys

1477
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,000
to save your liver to save your pancreas

1478
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,799
so you don't blow out your pancreas so

1479
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,960
you don't blow out your liver

1480
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,480
okay so you can put a lid over those

1481
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,000
mashed potatoes right there in your

1482
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
lettuce just like that

1483
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
and there you go

1484
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,000
really good that's another option

1485
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,920
and i don't want you guys getting

1486
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,400
confused about something

1487
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,920
yesterday you saw me eating different

1488
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,680
things you saw me eating the pea hummus

1489
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,160
and you saw me eating the bananas

1490
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,799
then you saw me eating the papaya and

1491
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,400
then

1492
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,839
i think there's some comments out there

1493
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,520
there's some people that were like oh my

1494
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,520
god i could do the mono cleanse and have

1495
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,280
peas and bananas together

1496
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,000
no no i'm just i'm just demonstrating

1497
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
so that's why i'm i'm kind of breaking

1498
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,839
the mono cleanse

1499
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,599
challenge around a little bit not

1500
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,640

1501
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,920

1502
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,319

1506
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,440
of the options the papaya option in

1507
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,720

1514
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,559

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,839
question i have for you guys are you

1517
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,839
guys eating enough

1518
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:45,839
so i got the pan on what i'm going to do

1519
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,839
is cook some peas

1520
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:58,319
the pan on here no cheese no butter

1521
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:02,160
no milk

1522
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,200
all right i know we like the sour cream

1523
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,280
in our potatoes i know

1524
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,640
we like the cheese we know we like the

1525
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,160
butter on our potatoes but you want to

1526
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,760
do this i know we like the oil in there

1527
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,520
but you don't want to do that

1528
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,520
you don't

1529
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,359
i got my pan on i'm gonna drop some peas

1530
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,240
in a little bit

1531
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,240
get my pan hot

1532
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,319
so all right so now there is

1533
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:31,119
an option with the mono cleanse

1534
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,079
right here that's the winter squash so

1535
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,720
the steamed winter squash right

1536
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,160
okay you can do that option and you can

1537
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,440
combine that

1538
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,720
if you're somebody especially if you're

1539
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,920
somebody that's like totally freaking

1540
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,920
out you're like there's not in

1541
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,960
there's not enough options i'm bored or

1542
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,680
i can't do this because

1543
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,839
i've been too spoiled for too many years

1544
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,000
eating whatever i want and i just

1545
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,599
i can't do this so you can do the

1546
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,319
steamed winter squash

1547
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,400
with steamed green beans brussels

1548
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:01,359
sprouts or asparagus

1549
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,040
isn't that great isn't that great it is

1550
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,960
really i mean when you think about it to

1551
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,319
do all the healing you need to do

1552
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,079
it's good to know you look you can

1553
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,319
branch out with another

1554
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,680
option like that and that's pretty cool

1555
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,480
this is so good by the way

1556
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,079
i know this is so simplistic but when

1557
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,280
you're on the mono cleanse and your

1558
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,680
taste buds

1559
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,839
are going back to where they should be

1560
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,079
and you're recalibrating the senses and

1561
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:25,359
you're recalibrating the cranial nerves

1562
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,520
right

1563
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,000
so you're recalibrating the cranial

1564
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,440
nerves to your taste buds

1565
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,920
right so all those cranial nerves

1566
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,799
stemming out of your brain stem and then

1567
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,599
going to

1568
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:41,599
your tongue to your mouth to your

1569
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,319
salivary glands right those cranial

1570
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,319
nerves

1571
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,240
they're getting rewired they're getting

1572
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,559
recalibrated and rewired

1573
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,400
that's why it's important right there

1574
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,240
that alone is really

1575
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,760
really really an important reason for

1576
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,359
doing this

1577
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,319
okay so i'm letting that pan heat up a

1578
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,680
little bit and i'm going to have a

1579
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,680
little bit more of this because this is

1580
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,400
so good

1581
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,720
and believe me check this out you guys

1582
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,720
right

1583
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:16,480
when your butt gets hungry

1584
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:19,520
when you get hungry hungry

1587
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,079

it feeds viruses it feeds bacteria

1668
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,160

need a pizza so i think i'm gonna go

1715
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,240
with that intuitive feeling

1716
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,160
yeah i'm gonna use my intuitive eating

1717
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,240
ability that i had

1718
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,960
all along yeah i'm gonna eat intuitively

1719
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,640
and i and i

1720
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,440
and i feel there's a craving and it must

1721
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,880
be justified and i i want a pizza with

1722
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,960
some

1723
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,240
with some sausage on it no i'll just go

1724
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,520
with pepperoni

1725
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,000
okay all right i'll wait for that pizza

1726
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:18,480

1727
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,480
okay good

1728
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,359
i'm waiting for that pizza you guys so

1729
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,559
hopefully we get that pizza

1730
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,920
you know and the bugs inside of us they

1731
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,119
want

1732
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,079
they want those foods and so they can

1733
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,839
tell us to get those foods that's what's

1734
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,799
happening they can tell us to get those

1735
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,400
foods

1736
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,160
because once those bugs are starving

1737
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,799
inside of us

1738
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,720
we think it's our intuitive everyday

1739
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,920
 intuitive thing that people are

1740
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,280
saying out there

1741
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,799
i'm not saying people aren't intuitive

1742
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,559
they are intuitive but when it comes

1743
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,720
down to what they eat they're not

1744
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,079
i'm sorry we've been poisoned so much

1745
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,599
with all our caffeine and everything

1746
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,319
else we don't know what we intuitively

1747
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,920
like or not

1748
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,680
we've been trained to like vinegar we

1749
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,200
don't know vinegar destroys the body but

1750
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,880
we intuitively eat it

1751
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,240
are you kidding me like we're

1752
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,880
intuitively eating

1753
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,400
no sorry we're addicted to all these

1754
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,760
poisons and we're used to eating all

1755
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,839
these poisons and flavors and that's

1756
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,559
what we do right

1757
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,680

1796
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,520
keeping that keep keep in mind that when

1797
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,799
you get hungry enough

1798
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,799
and you clean things up

1799
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,520
okay and those toxins start coming out

1800
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,799
and those bugs start dying you're gonna

1801
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,640
want something bad

1802
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,839
keep that in mind you're gonna want

1803
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,079
something bad

1804
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,079
okay

1805
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,839
really important to know okay you're

1806
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,119
going to want something bad

1807
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,920
and then you're going to have old

1808
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:18,080
adrenaline come out of your liver

1809
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,239
toxins that are inside your liver the

1810
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,080
old adrenaline

1811
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:23,600
and that adrenaline has information from

1812
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,279
any hard times you might have had

1813
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,440
you had a breakup with the relationship

1814
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,159
many years ago all that adrenaline that

1815
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,000
was surging

1816
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:32,080
surging through you when you had that

1817
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,239
breakup

1818
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:36,719
that adrenaline stored itself in your

1819
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:39,120
cells so when you start mono eating

1820
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,799
and that adrenaline comes out pockets of

1821
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,799
that garbage come out

1822
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,319
it might have information in there and

1823
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,839
you might feel a little sad you might

1824
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,679
feel a little emotional you might want

1825
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,440
to go and then eat a bunch of

1826
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,880
peanut butter and you want them

1827
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,920
chocolate you might want to

1828
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,239
stick a chocolate bar in a peanut butter

1829
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,239
jar

1830
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:03,679
[Music]

1831
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,359
so this is really incredible by the way

1832
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:08,880
especially when you

1833
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,640
get rid of all that crazy food

1834
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,719
and you give your body a chance to heal

1835
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:16,880
and you start getting hungry

1836
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,880
this this literally is so good for you

1837
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:24,400
i'm steaming some peas

1838
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,400
i'm going to move this over

1839
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,960
what you're doing is you're stopping

1840
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,159
from chasing the high you're not running

1841
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,560
on adrenaline anymore

1842
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:41,839
and you're not chasing the high anymore

1843
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,480
what you're doing is you're working on

1844
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,080
healing

1845
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,679
and that's what's happening now in your

1846
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,319
life when you're doing this you're

1847
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,520
working

1848
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:52,159
