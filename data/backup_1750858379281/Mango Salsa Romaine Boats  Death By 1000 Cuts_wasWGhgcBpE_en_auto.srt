10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,000
aspects of it

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840

doctor yesterday and

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
asked for half vials and the doctor

84
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
looked at me

85
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
and said we don't do half [Â __Â ] but yet

86
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,120
but yet

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
you know what's crazy austin is there's

88
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
a lot of people saying they're asking

89
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
their doctors can can you do half

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
vials and they're saying no problem and

91
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
a lot of phlebotomists now are saying

92
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
hey no problem

93
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
and it's really difficult when they do

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,640
that because yeah of course you can do

95
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
half files right

96
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
of course there's the half files out

97
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,040
there of course in

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
because if anybody just got on here

99
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
right

100
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
this you know this episode that the

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920

i talk about too much blood is taken

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
which you lose

106
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,560
your cbc cbc you were good to me

107
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599

and that's what they do they remove

110
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,120
remove remove they remove

111
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,440
um and and when they remove

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
you're you're losing that immune system

113
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
a little bit a little bit a little bit a

114
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
little bit and then a lot more of it a

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
lot more of it and the bone marrow has

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,920
to kill itself

117
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,200
to actually try to restore and recreate

118
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,840
and recreate um uh

119
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,840
the you know recreate the immune system

120
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
and then we get in trouble

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,720
so the bottom line is um you know

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,159
i in the episode if you guys want to

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,439
know i talk about how you ask your

124
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,280
doctor for half files ask your

125
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,680
phlebotomist do have files

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,599
the lab will take quarter vials we've

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,159
had rns on instagram

128
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
come on and say that yeah we take

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
quarter vials

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
at our lab you know we'll take half

131
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,479
files um

132
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
so yeah it's really important to know

133
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,280
the stuff uh

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,240
so we're making mango salsa remain boats

135
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,479
all right and we're talking about what

136
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,160
you know austin asked for half files

137
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,840
it's it's not easy you know it's not

138
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,120
easy when that happens i i've

139
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,759

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
so if the doctor doesn't take look if

142
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
it's if it was me right

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,440

144
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,919
your doctor all you guys but if it was

145
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
me

146
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,000
like me what i would do is be like okay

147
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
well you take full vials you don't take

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
all right well then you know i'm gonna

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,080
give you two to three vials

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,000
that's what i would do um i'll give you

152
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
two to three vials if you only take full

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,759
vials i'll give you two full vials

154
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,840
uh three full vials the most um

155
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
listen to the podcast and all that for

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
sure

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
deborah hi anthony not feeling my best

158
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,880
today oh no

159
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
no you know i mean that's not good

160
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
that's not good

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:27,280
deborah you having one of those days

162
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,000
yeah yeah you know it's three steps up

163
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
two steps back down right so three steps

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
up

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,199
and then two steps back down right

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
but what happens is when you start

167
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,320
feeling a little better

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
on your three steps up you start doing

169
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
more

170
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
and what spirit of compassion has always

171
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
told me is when

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
and then people start doing a little bit

173
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,720
more than they normally do but they

174
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
but but you know it's hard to tell but

175
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,919
you do a little bit more and

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
then you feel like you get kicked back

177
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,680
down again and

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
but then you're down again down again

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,440
for a little bit and then you go back up

180
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,800
but then you go back up a step a little

181
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
higher

182
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
and you know and there's this process

183
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,039
you're climbing a slaughter you're

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,600
three steps up two steps back

185
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,360
right three steps up and that's how

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,639
healing works in the body and there's

187
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
nothing more

188
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,759
there's nothing more you know as far as

let's talk about it

211
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,840
um so here's what i do okay

212
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,759
i mean in the morning if if i don't get

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,880
you know i mean it happens things are

215
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,720
going crazy

216
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
because the celery juice is a powerful

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,599
healing tool we know that right

218
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360
but i'm using for my friends and family

219
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
the wild blueberry juice is a powerful

220
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,039
tool too so it's one you know it's one

221
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,919
of those things i just love tools

222
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,319
you know and it matters so what i do is

223
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
um

224
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
in the morning if if for some reason i

225
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
didn't have my

226
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,599
celery juice yet right and i'm in a

227
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
place where

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,360
um where the the morning's coming on

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,800
it's getting late you know it's getting

230
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,759
late in the morning late in the day and

231
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,759
i'm like whoa

232
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,080
or lately we're late morning now i'll

233
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,039
make sure i get a couple of shots in

234
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,160
um sometimes i'll do them early in the

235
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,759
morning too

236
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,520
right so what i do is

237
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
i actually get in touch with the energy

238
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,400
here with what's in here so that's how

239
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
i do it right and i didn't tell you guys

240
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
because

241
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,199
um i had i i've had moments in my life

242
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,360
right

243
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,800
that i've been blessed to sit in a wild

244
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
blueberry field and it's something that

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,080
i can't even tell you right because the

246
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,560
plants are

247
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
thousands of years old and thousands of

248
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,599
years old

249
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,120
and they've been doing their thing every

250
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
single year they come up out of the

251
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,759
ground you can't kill these things

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
they're

253
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,319
they're so potent and powerful in my

254
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,199
opinion it's like adaptogenic times 10

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
right

256
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,719
and so i've had the experience of

257
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
knowing what it's like to cut to lay in

258
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
the field and meditate

259
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,680
to meditate in wild blueberry fields

260
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,399
where i'm just

261
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
laying in them and you can feel the

262
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,200
energy you've got

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
the earth and the blueberries are all

264
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,880
around you and they're coming up

265
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,080
around your arms and it's it's

266
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,279
incredible yeah you turn

267
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
blue and you got to pick the clothes you

268
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
want to wear that day if you do it

269
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,080
because

270
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
those things are going to be blue

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
they're just going to be blue right

272
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,760
and uh because you're laying on those

273
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
berries you're crushing those berries

274
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
right

275
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,080
and i've been there and you don't have

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,120
to have that experience right

277
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,959
because it's in the bottle

278
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,959
what we're not that's how i think about

279
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,360
it you know it's in the bottle

280
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,160
and so i do this little meditation

281
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
around

282
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
um the wild blueberry juice is what i do

283
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,080
and it's

284
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
i sit i sit quietly for a moment right

285
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
and you can lay down

286
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,240
too but i sit quietly in a spot and i

287
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
close my eyes or i'll lean back in a

288
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
nice comfy chair

289
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
um or lay down on the floor or on the

290
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
couch or something

291
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
and i'll think about the power these

292
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,880
wild blueberry plants have being around

293
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,080
for thousands of years and

294
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,200
how they feed all the animals they feed

295
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,360
the deer

296
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,000
they feed the moose they feed the bears

297
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
they feed the foxes right and i think

298
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
about all that and i think about

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
like all the hungry animals that when

300
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
these blueberries start coming up these

301
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
wild blueberries this isn't

302
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,240
this isn't cultivated blueberry the wild

303
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,200
blueberries when they're coming up

304
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
in the fields i think about the foxes

305
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
going through the field right

306
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
and they're hungry because it's not easy

307
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,760
to get food for for wild animals it's

308
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
not easy at all

309
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,440
the foxes will just sit in the field and

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
they'll eat and i'll remember this and

311
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
i'll be thinking about this right

312
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
and if you haven't experienced it it's

313
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,480
okay you can just think about it and

314
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,399
and so what happens is that um that's

315
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
how i get in touch

316
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,160
with the wild blueberry the energy of it

317
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,880
and that's part of

318
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
how i take the shots okay uh which is

319
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
really

320
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
really big part of it so then of course

321
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,160
i open up the bottle

322
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,680
right and i think about the color

323
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,399
and i'm there's you can't juice

324
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
a cultivated blueberry and get that

325
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,600
color

326
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,440
it's not gonna happen you know and from

327
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
what i've seen in my opinion and what

328
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
i've seen and what i believe because

329
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
i've

330
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,399
juiced myself so like regular cultivated

331
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
blueberries have juiced everything right

332
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,680
and so i think about the color and

333
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,360
where's that what

334
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,000
what is that color like what that's

335
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
the power color right that's what that

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
is

337
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,640
so i connect like my mind and body

338
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
to what the reality is of what i'm

339
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,519
seeing

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,360
so that my immune system so everything

341
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
in my body is starting to like

342
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
resonate to be like whoa are we gonna

343
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
receive

344
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
that color those pigments like are we

345
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
going to receive those pigments

346
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
so that's what i do you guys can do

347
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
something different if you like and you

348
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
can do

349
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
any you don't have to do any of this you

350
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,440
can just take your shot

351
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,240
but i'm just saying so and then i pour

352
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
the shot

353
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,200
with all of this in mind so i connect my

354
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,240
body to what this really is

355
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,480
and you know and i and i really kind of

356
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
sing a blessing is what i do because i'm

357
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
like well

358
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
you know how how is it possible when i

359
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
was younger

360
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
and i think about those blueberries in

361
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,680
the field that they're so

362
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,320
hard to harvest and to

363
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
bring to a market as it is never mind

364
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
actually

365
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,240
having that juice and this is all part

366
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
of how i take the shots you know and

367
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
then i

368
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
send it down like a tequila but i've

369
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,480
never had tequila

370
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
so anyway as i do a shot every single

371
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
day

372
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
some days i'll take two shots and there

373
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
are days where i take three shots and

374
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
i'm like

375
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
you know but because

376
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,079
huh hello

377
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,760
what's going on huh

378
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,880
um how come wyman's isn't organic

379
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
do they use pesticides so i can answer

380
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,360
that

381
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,880
okay so wyman's is a wild food it's a

382
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,399
wild food

383
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
and so wild blueberries they take care

384
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
of themselves

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
for almost all of of what they need they

386
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,800
take care of themselves

387
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,120
and a cultivated blueberry you have to

388
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
whether it's organic a cultivated

389
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,279
blueberry whether it's organic

390
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,160
or it's conventional it has to be

391
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,440
sprayed

392
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,600
three times a week so the organic water

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,639
the organic blueberries

394
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
they have to be sprayed the organic

395
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
the cultivated organic blueberries have

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
to be sprayed spray spray

397
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,079
the cultivated blueberry whether it's

398
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
conventional

399
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,519
it has to be sprayed spray spray right

400
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
so and the thing is with sprays and you

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
have to realize

402
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
that sprays are a catch-22 so the

403
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
organic sprays are a catch-22 and i

404
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
talked about

405
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
how what's in those things but what

406
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
wyman's does is because the crops take

407
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
care of themselves

408
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,079
they can pick and choose where they they

409
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
spray and they don't use pollinator

410
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,079
killers

411
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,480
and so it's only a part of a crop

412
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,079
certain time of year or one year and a

413
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,279
year to go by and they don't do it all

414
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
another year could go by and they don't

415
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,560
don't do it all

416
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
and they're barry's got the zero

417
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
pesticide residue

418
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
because of this because a wild food

419
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
sustains itself and takes care of itself

420
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,399
the thing is with wild foods that

421
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,959
are really important wild foods like the

422
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,480
wild blueberries are better than

423
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,440
um organic so that's another thing too

424
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
so wild food is better than organic so

425
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
that keep that in mind

426
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,399
and so it's incredible about this food

427
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,560
is because

428
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,839
the plants protect themselves to such a

429
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,399
degree

430
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
they that you don't have to be spraying

431
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
spraying spraying spraying spring

432
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,079
springs brain because that's it

433
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,760
and that's what's incredible about it so

434
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
if you get like a fly that comes from

435
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,639
south america and it's once every couple

436
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
of years and it gets bad at

437
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
one little area of a crop or something

438
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
and then they got to spray but they

439
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
don't use the

440
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
pollinator killers and now vegetables

441
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
are different

442
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,120
the conventional vegetable conventional

443
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,920
vegetables conventional fruits

444
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,000
they get sprayed three four times a week

445
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,480
with pollinator killers

446
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,760
and really bad sprays just three four

447
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
times a week

448
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
whole entire different thing and uh but

449
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,839
anyway

450
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:21,360
some info there how do you get it

451
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:21,360
um so you can go to shop.wymans.com so

452
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,839
shop.wymanswymans.com

453
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,440
so that's where you can go making a

454
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
mango salsa romaine

455
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
boats so that's a little bit on how i

456
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,920
take my shots

457
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,680
and we're in this we got the mangoes we

458
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,720
got the tomatoes we got the lettuce

459
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,639
we're gonna do this we're talking about

460
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
death by a thousand cuts

461
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,120
and so and what i love about death by a

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
thousand cuts is there's things you can

463
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,759
do

464
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
to slow down the cuts or stop the cuts

465
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,959
or reverse the cuts

466
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
you know and that's important too

467
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,440
because we're doing all these things

468
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,480
that aren't so good okay we're doing our

469
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,480
colognes and perfumes right

470
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
we got our colognes we got our perfumes

471
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
and that one that one's just brutal

472
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,639
right there

473
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,720
you guys that one's bad too i mean this

474
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,959
stuff is so harsh but this stuff lowers

475
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,120
the immune system so clones perfumes

476
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,279
lowers the immune system that's a cut

477
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,959
you just got cut that's how it works

478
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,000
right so you got that right there maybe

479
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
you're doing tuna

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
in a can right you got the metal from

481
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,639
the can you got the merkur from tuna

482
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,160
the mercury that's a couple of cuts

483
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,440
right there okay

484
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,240
and that's important too um

485
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
yeah and that you know it's it's

486
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,079
important to know

487
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
right so we got that and wondering what

488
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,160
other cuts are you doing right

489
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
are you doing some eggs yeah death by a

490
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
thousand cuts

491
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,839
it's no joke because what happens with

492
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
eggs is they feed all the bugs that keep

493
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
people sick

494
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
you're sick with a symptom you got

495
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,800
different symptoms you got different

496
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,279
conditions

497
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,560
i talk about the pathogens involved for

498
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,560
those symptoms and conditions and then

499
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
we're eating eggs and then eggs

500
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
so i didn't ruin anybody's eggs they

501
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,760
were ruined before

502
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,199
really important to know so um

503
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,039
these are all just a couple of cuts

504
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,280
right here

505
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,559
right then you got your you're drinking

506
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
out of your cans

507
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,079
throughout your life you're drinking out

508
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,600
here soda cans you drink even your

509
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,919
healthier

510
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,959
beverages and soft drinks like i'm at

511
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,280
the store and

512
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,959
hey this one says organic and it's in a

513
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,160
can this one says

514
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,039
you know no no no bad stuff in here and

515
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
it's in a can

516

right this one's you know blah blah blah

517
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
but what happens is that

518
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,880
you're doing the aluminum that's another

519
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
cut but they add up and they add up and

520
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
they add up and they add up and they add

521
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,440
up

522
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
and that's what happens lunella says

523
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,360
foraging for wild foods

524
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
should be should be the new grocery

525
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,160
shopping that would be incredible it'd

526
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,919

tested

534
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,280
right they take a lot they'll take 60

535
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
milliliters 70 milliliters 100

536
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,960

eggs lots of health people

591
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,240
nutritionists etc recommend eggs to

592
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,000
healthy protein

593
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,799
it's so frustrating when all the

594
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,960
information is so conflicting

595
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,960
uh yeah no i

596
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,200

now i heard what danielle said uh-huh i

598
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,840
get it because everybody's talking eggs

599
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,600
yeah they thought lots of things were

600
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,120
healthy throughout the years

601
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,799
uh-huh they thought lobotomies were

602
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,840
healthy yeah

603
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,960
every health professional every

604
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,440
dietitian every doctor

605
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,880
every professional every psychiatrist

606
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,000
every therapist believe

607
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,600
that removing the front of the

608
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,400
brain from a young girl because she had

609
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
anxiety

610
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,880
was the best way to fix her yeah yeah

611
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,240
it was it was it was always like that

612
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,960
hundreds of thousands of of girls

613
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,600
young women their the front of the brain

614
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,480
was

615
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,440
torn off yeah they had a probe go up

616
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,400
their nostril

617
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,400
right to the front of brain

618
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,360
yeah this isn't funny because

619
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,880
it happened and it's real every health

620
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
professional

621
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
thought it was the correct protocol and

622
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,159
procedure

623
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,919
yeah exactly for sure

624
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
i know people protect their eggs because

625
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,880
every health professional believes that

626
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,039
they're good for us

627
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,039
but i i think what people don't realize

628
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,400
is that

629
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,679

630
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,960
is that sorry guys hold on a second

631
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,559

632
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
realize a couple of things here that

633
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,120
basically what happens is that here's

634
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,440

okay so just kind of leave me alone all

662
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,679
right i got another call on the other

663
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,280
line

664
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,360
hello well see what you don't know

665
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,559
is that everybody that's sick with

666
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
chronic fatigue syndrome and

667
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,520
fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis and

668
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
so many other different diseases and

669
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,039
conditions

670
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,000
have bugs one of the bugs is called

671
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,159
epstein-barr

672
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
it was raised in the labs inside the

673
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,919
eggs so what they did was

674
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,039
they cut the top of the egg and they put

675
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
the epstein bars

676
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
and all the different pathogens in the

677
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,559
egg and

678
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,440
that's what they did and then we eat the

679
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,159
eggs

680
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,640
and we feed any bugs that are inside of

681
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
us

682
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
and that's how it works so the worst

683
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
thing you could ever do is offer eggs

684
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,679
for

685
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
women with pcos and endometriosis it

686
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,679
makes it worse

687
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,960
if you have if you tell women with pcos

688
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,400
to eat more eggs

689
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,799
their androgen is going to get out of

690
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,840
control it's not going to be fixable

691
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,320
eggs are that that harmful

692
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
for women when they're sick with chronic

693
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,960
illness

694
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
one of the medical medium tools was to

695
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,000
remove eggs

696
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,360
so that women can have a chance to heal

697
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,120
different conditions

698
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,480
so i get it i know that every health

699
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
professional says that

700
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,919
but just so you know that the lobotomies

701
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,720
is just one out of hundreds of examples

702
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
i can use

703
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
where every health professional in the

704
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
world agreed with it

705
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
uh-huh yep now i got to put these guys

706
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,640
down they're starting to get

707
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,279
starting to get a little out of control

708
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,919
oh okay

709
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,559
i'll see you guys later i got to put

710
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,559
these guys back

711
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,840
all right we got to stop fooling around

712
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,720
we we need to

713
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,960
make these mango boats before it gets

714
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
late

715
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,960
kelly says doubtful it works like that

716
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,480
you mean at the egg factory

717
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,080
or or do you mean eggs

718
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,960
actually it does work like that very

719
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,520
important

720
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,360
to know okay so i'm going to use another

721
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,880
mango

722
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,000
um it you got to listen to the egg pot

723
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
podcast

724
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,640
so what happened was all the different

725
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,159
pathogens that we have today

726
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,159
were raised in eggs okay and

727
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,279
i'm going to give you a little 4-1-1

728
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,279
about how it works

729
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
the chronic illness is as bad as it is

730
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,760
today because of this

731
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,400
so there was no other food that would

732
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,919
proliferate a pathogen in a controlled

733
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,039
environment right

734
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,760
so you couldn't inject a pathogen

735
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,320
in an animal and then have control over

736
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
it

737
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,000
because the animal's immune system deer

738
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,279
first flying everywhere so i'm gonna

739
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,240
have deer for

740
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,279
in my food but you can't control the

741
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,120
environment so

742
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,919
what happens with the medical industry

743
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,960
the reason why they didn't use animals

744
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,960
as the proliferator okay is because and

745
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,720
i see a medical doctor's on too

746
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
and you guys there's a lot of medical

747
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,159
doctors that leave

748
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,159
comments and just so you know they're

749
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,320
blocked not by me

750
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
but by facebook and instagram i'm

751
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
letting you know okay

752
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,279
um we've we've we've learned that

753
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
recently

754
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,400
that there are dozens and dozens of

755
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,640
doctors

756
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
and nurses that hey i'm a doctor and

757
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
everything else and i never

758
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,600
see their comment but i now have some

759
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
friends

760
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,440
that are going to be screen shooting

761
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
them and all that stuff so they don't

762
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,279
feel like

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,840
i'm actually not answering their

764
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,960
questions they always let dr fawn in

765
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,080
which is amazing only eggs okay

766
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,360
are eggplants amazing so um so here's

767
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,120
the difference

768
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
in they have to use the egg because the

769
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,559
egg doesn't have its own immune system

770
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,400
it doesn't so they used it as a living a

771
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
living creature basically

772
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,640
to in to inject pathogens so they can

773
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,000
proliferate but the egg

774
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
the reason why they proliferate in the

775
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
egg because the egg doesn't have its own

776
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,679
immune system and the proteins are

777
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
undeveloped

778
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
really important to know and that's the

779
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
difference between surviving when you

780
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,720
put a pathogen

781
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
in an animal versus thriving they needed

782
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
it to survive

783
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
to thrive is what they needed it because

784
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,760
when they injected them to animals

785
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,080
the animal's immune system would take

786
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,760
control over the pathogen and they would

787
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,480
lose control over the pathogen you see

788
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,320
how it works

789
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,600
so what they do is they raise the

790
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,679
pathogens in eggs

791
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:34,080
then they injected those pathogens into

792
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:36,799
animals for experimental

793
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
hello why am i not making the mango

794
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,919
salsa

795
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,520
boats yet i don't know just kind of

796
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,520
fooling around

797
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,520
put down the deer all right

798
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,919
all right guys that's the medical

799
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
industry they don't want me

800
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,000
talking about the pathogens inside the

801
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,720
eggs and how everybody gets sick

802
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
and uh huh it's ahead of the medical

803
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,760
industry

804
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,600
they want me to put the deer down and

805
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,120
stop talking about what they do

806
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,720
they want me to just make they want me

807
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,919
to just be a food dummy

808
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,360
mm-hmm yeah did you just say food dummy

809
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,520
they want to be want me to be a food

810
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,039
dummy you know like they just want me to

811
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
talk about the health benefits of a

812
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,080
tomato

813
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,159

814
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,600
not even the real ones yeah they want me

815
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
to just they want me to

816
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,440
play around with food only and not tell

817
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200

okay

836
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,159
teresa or the virus if it's in us

837
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,000
and the eggs cooked would it be active

838
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
well yeah the eggs could be cooked it's

839
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
still an under

840
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,559
underdeveloped protein and the

841
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,760
underdeveloped protein is what the eggs

842
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,279
was what sorry the pathogens know

843
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,679
exist like that's what they've been feed

844
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,120
on pathogens are

845
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,720
a pathogen that's been raised

846
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,120
never gets killed off right

847
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,799
it gets in the people and then when it

848
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,720
passes on to more people

849
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,080
it still has all the information of how

850
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
it was raised to begin with so it

851
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,520
already knows that it eats eggs so

852
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,399
and um yeah it's just what happens is

853
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,240
i'm not

854
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,840
i'm not anti-animal protein i'm not

855
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,159
anti-vegan and plant-based you guys you

856
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
guys

857
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,520
aren't in uh you guys aren't at a vegan

858
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,039
channel right now this is important to

859
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,559
know you're not at a vegan channel where

860
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,600
i'm gonna throw this vegan propaganda at

861
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
you and you're not

862
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,120
you're not at an animal protein channel

863
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
or i'm just gonna throw all this vegan

864
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,000
produce

865
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,120
this bad vegan you know the the animal

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,559
protein people

867
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
tell all the mommies that they're

868
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,720
starving their children feeding them

869
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,320
lettuce

870
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,679
and the you know the vegans and the

871
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,279
plant-based people telling all the

872
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,559
animal protein people that you

873
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,159
you're soulless because you're killing

874
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,480
animals and animals have souls and all

875
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,720
this

876
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
stuff i'm not into that i'm i'm into

877
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
tools you're right

878
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
i'm into tools like that's a tool right

879
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,799
i'm into

880
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,799
the three steps up two steps back three

881
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,279
steps up then you're healed boom gone

882
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,039
i'm into this everybody gets sick animal

883
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,039
protein people get sick plant-based

884
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
protein people get sick plant-based

885
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,360
people get sick they both get sick

886
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,120
and they both don't know what to do okay

887
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,720
if your plant-based stay plant-based

888
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,000
that's what i recommend if you're animal

889
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,279
protein-based and that's what you love

890
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,039
in all that you stay

891
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,159
protein base you can you know but but

892
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,720
you know it's important to know where

893
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,720
you are right here someone might be like

894
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,279
all right all right he's he's okay he's

895
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,519
gonna

896
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,640
he's all about just it's all vegan or

897
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
something no

898
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,600
but i i recommend if you're sick and you

899
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,480
got symptoms and conditions i recommend

900
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,640
as a

901
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
animal protein person to avoid eggs and

902
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,200
i recommend

903
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,679
as a plant-based person to avoid

904
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,039
going back to eggs because guess what

905
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,320
plant-based people do

906
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,960
here's what plant-based people do

907
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,000
hello huh you've been plant-based

908
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,559
really for what a year okay

909
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,399
let's go how's it working for you you

910
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,279
what's what's wrong

911
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,799
you're all sudden got fatigued and your

912
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,880
teeth are starting to have problems

913
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,120
really you think it's really the

914
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,519
plant-based thing

915
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,120
you do you're eating eggs now and fish

916
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,000
you're eating eggs and salmon

917
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,679
so you went back to eggs okay all right

918
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,039
i know a lot of vegan people run back to

919
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
eggs a lot of plant-based people run

920
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,000
back to eggs the first thing they run

921
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,679
back to it's why a lot of plant-based

922
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
people don't make fun of eggs

923
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,360
they know it's a comfort food and they

924
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,080
run back to it i know i know

925
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,320
but are you sure it's the plant-based

926
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,679
diet doing it or are you doing the

927
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,600
plant-based diet

928
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
wrong for what you need in your

929
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,240
condition because that's what happens to

930
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,240
animal protein people

931
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
keto people run from this ray run for

932
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,679
their lives from keto

933
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,760
animal protein people who are eating all

934
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039

many people heal that knowing the true

961
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,480
cause knowing the true cause of

962
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,080
why you're sick is half the battle one

963
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,039

964
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,440

965
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,880
i'll say it again if you don't if you

966
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,919
don't know

967
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,360
why you're sick we're gonna be throwing

968
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,159
darts at barns

969
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,720
guessing games running around trying to

970
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,200
heal

971
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,559
trying to fl this doctor that doctor we

972
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,760
don't know what's going on that's what's

973
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,799
gonna happen

974
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,240
knowing why you're sick is critical or

975
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,760
you're guessing games are happening and

976
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
guess what happens to guessing games

977
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,799
you might get a little better because

978
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,320
you're cleaning up your diet

979
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,600
right taking a few different random

980
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
sorted supplements that maybe a

981
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,320
practitioner has given you right

982
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
but you end up sick again and again

983
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,399
and again as time goes on then you're

984
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,119
confused at 10 more doctor's offices

985
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,560
that because unless you know why you're

986
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,760
sick

987
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
are you going to be able to do what you

988
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,079

a scientific study at you

1180
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,839
right here's a scientific study eggs are

1181
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,800
good for you it's the last thing you

1182
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,880

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,160
maybe you're getting out maybe you're

1186
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,920
lacking protein how stupid is that one

1187
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,599
for so long now

1188
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,800
meanwhile science science also says that

1189
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,240
eggs are high in cholesterol and give

1190
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,400
you strokes and heart attack

1191
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,359
isn't that funny so who's right who's

1192
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,040
wrong

1193
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
what's science why are health

1194
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,079
professionals saying eggs are so good

1195
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,520
for you when science is actually saying

1196
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,880
they give you strokes and heart attack

1197
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,480
right

1198
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,599
and then science will come up out of

1199
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,880
nowhere and be like you know what

1200
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,760
actually you know eggs are good it's a

1201
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
good protein

1202
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,079
it's like which way you're gonna go man

1203
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,079
which way

1204
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,839
right

1205
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:31,119
doing some tomatoes in the salsa gonna

1206
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:33,440
do a little bit more

1207
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,520
i think the bottom line is when you get

1208
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,520
sick right

1209
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,119
all bets are off all bets are off

1210
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,960
that's it it's like man

1211
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,319
it's just about getting the information

1212
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,800
and getting better

1213
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,599
right isn't it amazing that you think

1214
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,440
people think that

1215
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,720
if you don't have a letter after your

1216
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,839
name

1217
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,839

1218
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,920
phd md whatever i mean they think that

it doesn't matter how much experience

1225
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,880
they have how many doctors they

1226
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,880
they've helped over the years doesn't

1227
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,800
matter

1228
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,640
it doesn't matter of anything right

1229
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,079
doesn't matter the most powerful people

1230
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,839
