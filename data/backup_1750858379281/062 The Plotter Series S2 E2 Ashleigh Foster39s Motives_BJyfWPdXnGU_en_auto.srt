The Following episode is part of a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,640
series dedicated to exposing an

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,559
organized hateful group that has been on

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,759
a Relentless pursuit to destroy the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,719
medical medium community and that has

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
been attacking bullying harassing and

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,320
preying upon the chronically ill joining

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,920
me in this series is a guest named Amber

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,920
bakaro she's an alternative medicine

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,000
practitioner who became a whistleblower

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
in action when they tried to recruit her

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
to join them last year Amber caught the

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,399
main members of this group on legally

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,879
recorded calls describing their

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,640
premeditated multi-step plan to create a

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,520
quote post-medical medium era by feeding

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,559
false stories and claims about me and

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,559
about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,320
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,479
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,439
Netflix that would bring Fame and other

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,600
benefits to them now known infamously

25
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,840
instead for their malicious plot that

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,000
was caught on recording and exposed we

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,079
refer to this hateful group as the

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,960
plotters their entire smear campaign is

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,240
spearheaded by one woman who comes from

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,920
an extremely wealthy family didn't get

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,840
what she wanted from me years ago and is

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,759
now seeking Rev venge she's made it her

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,720
mission to gather a bunch of plotters

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,520
with ulterior motives and aess to grind

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,159
including competitors in the health

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,119
industry to try to frame medical medium

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,000
and take down the community what this

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,960
organized hateful group has done is

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,840
unprecedented it's one of the biggest

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,920
scandals that's ever happened in the

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,320
health industry as you'll see it's also

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
one of the biggest instances of

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,600
capturing corruption within the

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,600
mainstream media so prepare yourself for

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,399

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,520
going to be thoroughly untangling the

47
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,040
massive Web of Lies they have spun and

recordings and mindblowing evidence of

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,800
just how far they are going to lie to

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,720
try to get what they want some of the

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,480

the plots and will be reenacted for

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,239
greater ease in following along those

59
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,720

can find video versions of these

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,560
episodes on the medical medium YouTube

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,159
and Rumble channels that will be

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,400
displaying screenshots photos videos and

64
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:03,959
more some of you may be unaware that

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,920
this has even been happening but many of

66
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,280
you have been tremendously injured and

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,799
harmed by what they have done the record

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,799
needs to be set straight and they need

69
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,280
to be called out for what they've done

70
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,400
and are still doing the medical medium

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,879
Community does not deserve to be

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,640
attacked like this and we are going to

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,870
set the record straight as many times as

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,469
we need to

75
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,469
[Music]

76
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,239
people who lie are liars if you're

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,439
willing to lie about one thing you might

78
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,920
be willing to lie about everything One

79
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:52,200
Lie calls into question the entirety of

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,200
someone's character what about two three

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,840
four 100

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,560
lies these are words from Ashley Foster

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,120
words that she is soon going to eat

84
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,680
because as I've said from the very

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,400
beginning what Ashley projects and tries

86
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,599
to accuse other people of being and

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,040
doing is usually what she herself is

88
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,560
guilty of being and

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,560
doing Ashley is the ring leader of an

90
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,440
organized anti-ed medium hateful group

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,400
that she created on a mountain of Lies

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
Ashley has been lying and attacking

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,479
Anthony for years and she has now

94
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
incited a group of people that are out

95
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,240
there attacking harassing and bullying

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
the medical medium community and even

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,320
going as far as to make videos of

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,800
themselves burning medical medium books

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,400
okay all these medical medium books are

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,639
going to be burned

101
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,639
today it's

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,759
happening this is going in first celery

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,199
juice

104
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,800
one I took out the insides cuz it's

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,520
going to take forever to burn why is

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,520
Ashley really doing this many have asked

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,639
in response to the activities of the

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,759
plotters one online commenter said it's

109
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,759
clear there are other motives behind all

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,560
this a different commenter said it's

111
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,280
just full-on Reckless ruthless attacks

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,600
that seems like it doesn't have anything

113
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
to do with the realities nor facts of

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,840
our community just attacks simply to

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,639
bring us down utterly nonsensical and

116
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,400
infuriating and another commenter said

117
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,240
it's so clear that bears an agenda I

118
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,639
don't see why anyone would listen to all

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,120
their

120
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,880
n so what are Ashley's ulterior motives

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,960
what is this really about for her what

122
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,960
type of person is capable of harboring

123
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,240
so much hatred towards someone who does

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,160
nothing but help the chronically ill

125
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,560
even long after the madeup story they

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,639
tried to use to slander him was proven

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,639
to be

128
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,240
false what type of person could be so

129
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,639
painfully entitled and careless so as to

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,639
spend years plotting and obsessively

131
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,319
trying to bring Anthony and the entire

132
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,240
medical medium community of chronically

133
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,800
ill people who are already struggling

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
down today we're going to be answering

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,240
these questions Ashley's true motives

136
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,639
are going to be exposed for the first

137
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,400
time we're going to be revealing some

138
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,400
shocking new facts that are wildly

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,639
inconsistent with Ashley's Proclamation

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,000
that she's doing this smear campaign

141
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,360
quote asfor step to Zone and we're going

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,919
to begin exposing some of the many many

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,240
more lies that Ashley has told since the

144
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,960
release of our podcast episodes last

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
year you may recall that in our previous

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,080
episodes we played the following

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,479
recording of Taylor call and Robbie

148
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,840
Barbaro describing their friend and the

149
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,280
number one plotter Ashley

150
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,280
Foster and by the way Ash do need to

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,280
work Ash has ever ever the woman is she

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,479
family money a lot of it you know

153
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,479
private jet and plus

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,840
Ashley has since responded to this part

155
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,000
of our podcasts somebody said to her you

156
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,879
are independently wealthy what is the

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,639
source of your family's wealth I'm

158
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:16,479
suspicious because of that and Ashley

159
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,240
replied my dad grew up without shoes or

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,240
electricity his first job was knocking

161
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,160
the cement off off all Briggs for a

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,120
penny a brick he worked incredibly hard

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,280
harder than anyone else I have ever met

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,479
eventually

165
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,039
he was able to buy one of the houses he

166
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,599
built for

167
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:41,520
$700 he sold it later for a few thousand

168
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,280
he built another house by hand and sold

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,919
that by the time he died at 83 he had

170
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,680
been working in real estate for 60 years

171
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,680
he built and sold houses and eventually

172
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,960
apartment buildings he was able to leave

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,400
an amazing Legacy for our family I'm

174
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,759
incredibly proud of him and

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,720
grateful that said we don't own a plane

176
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,560
like they said in the podcast we aren't

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
able to spend money without thinking

178
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,520
about it we don't have vacation homes

179
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,759
like Anthony does we don't have the

180
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,759
ability to pay in definitely for

181
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,199
aggressive lawyers like Anthony does

182
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,879
we're just able to live a comfortable

183
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,039
life where I can stay home with my kids

184
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,199
and homeschool them my husband works

185
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:35,800
incredibly hard there's nothing crazy

186
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,440
here we're just blessed and I'm really

187
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,039
grateful so Ashley is claiming

188

that she can't afford ongoing legal

193
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,800
representation of her own and she's

194
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,720
depicting herself as having a simple

195
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,480
humble life just to give you an idea of

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,440

Moose's trouble at Pillar income Asset

307
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,480
Management arrived with a document he

308
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,920
had never seen it was a two-page

309
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,560
contract that said moose had signed his

310
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,399
2% stake in a $1.8 billion real estate

311
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,279

had Dallas real estate executive Jean

313
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,440
Phillips signature and his own but there

314
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,079
was one big problem moose said he had

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,839
never signed the contract the allegedly

316
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,720
forged contract was key evidence in a

317
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,440
trial where a jury recently awarded

318
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,399
moose more than $22 million in salary

319
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,120
and real estate compensation after he

320
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,600
sued his former

321
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,560
employer the plaintiff's petition calls

322
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,160
the document in which moose allegedly

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,800
signed over his rights to vaa the

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,680
doctored letter and says it was created

325
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,920
by taking the signature from a different

326
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,040
document and combining it with a new

327
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,199
cover page it also says the document was

328
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,079
altered by a typewriter after the fact

329
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,040
to reflect that pillar was a third party

330
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,839
to the agreement with Phillips and moose

331
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,040
the pillar signature Line's font differs

332
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,160
from the rest of the

333
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,399
document as it turns out it's an awfully

334
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,440
fragile glass mansion that Ashley is

335
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,040
trying to throw stones from can we play

336
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
that last audio again

337
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:09,199
and by the way Ash do need to work Ash

338
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:13,440
ever ever the woman is she family money

339
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,800
a lot of it you know private jet and

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,199
plus Ashley's closest friends said that

341
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,079
she doesn't have to work and that she

342
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,120
has a lot of family money like private

343
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,600
jet

344
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,959
plus and then Ashley denied their claims

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
after the podcast came out

346
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,680
that said we don't own a plane like they

347
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,519
said in the podcast we aren't able to

348
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,399
spend money without thinking about it we

349
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,399
don't have vacation homes like Anthony

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
does this part is hilarious because

351
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,560
Ashley has always been an aspiring

352
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,120

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,079
multiple people who have since submitted

355
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,880

374
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,000
California sold for $7.3 million and we

375
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,800
know people who have visited multiple

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,760
different properties of Ashley's in

377
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,240
different places around the country some

378
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,919
of which are worth close to 13

379
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,959
million once in the process of trying to

380
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,280
purchase a property Ashley had sent a

381
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,919
text to a friend that says the

382
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,280
following our first loan didn't close 2

383
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,439
days before closing the board of the

384
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,600
bank had approved the loan when our

385
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,200
broker got a random call they were

386
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,120
cancelling it

387
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,559
the friend asked was your dad a backer

388
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,039
and Ashley

389
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:42,400
replied I was in tears and so confused

390
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,600
and he was so pissed off and

391
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,520
Confused my dad looks at the paperwork

392
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,600
and goes oh this Bank never would have

393
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:59,679
made you Al loone I sued them for $70

394
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,679
million last year # thanks Dad

395
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,200
the friends said holy [ __ ]

396
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,320
LOL so Ashley's dad a late billionaire

397
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,280
had sued a bank for $70

398
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,400
million but Ashley wants you to believe

399
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,000
that she can't afford a lawyer and that

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,159
she is somehow a victim of Anthony's

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
legal representation because she has

402
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,000
simply been notified that she is

403
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,799
repeatedly spreading verifiably false

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
information about Anthony and about

405
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,039
medical medium information and she

406
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,760
continues to ignore facts that have been

407
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,679
presented to her in a different text

408
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,320
Ashley wrote

409
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,120
this we bought an apartment building in

410
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,440
Texas with the help of my

411
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,240
dad Ashley and her husband bought an

412
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,960
apartment building with the help of her

413
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,520
dad a lot of people rent apartments not

414
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
many people can buy apartment buildings

415
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,280
as investment

416
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,280
properties and we have another text from

417
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,240
Ashley to a

418
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,559
friend a lot of huge huge things going

419
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,080
on over here a 100 plus million doll

420
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,200
deals Etc it's a lot to get my mind

421
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,520
around and I feel easily overwhelmed if

422
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,960
I don't just focus on listening for what

423
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,720
God has for

424
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,840
me so she's involved with a 100 plus

425
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,200
million doll

426
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,320
deals 100 plus million dollar deals but

427
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,320
remember everybody Ashley just lives a

428
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,919
simp

429
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,960
humble life she can't even afford legal

430
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,960
representation and again she's the

431
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,120
victim when she gets called out for the

432
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,520
falsities that she originated and took

433
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,760
to the media with the expressed intent

434
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,760
of harming Anthony and the

435
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:51,440
community um oh my

436
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,760
um yeah we're hopeful that once the

437
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:00,640
article's out um one of the directors or

438
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,640
producers that Britain works with well

439
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,120
uh you know become interested in telling

440
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,960
the story really well I think it's going

441
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,760
to take that because Anthony is so um he

442
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,679
has such a presence and if it just stops

443
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,280
at the article I'm guessing that like

444
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,600
there would be some buzz in the medical

445
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,240
medium Community for a few months but

446
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,600
like really I think then it would kind

447
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,159
of die down ultimately the

448
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,320
way to really get the word out is like

449
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,360
would be like a Netflix documentary you

450
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,120
know

451
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,080
so um once you hit that level of like

452
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,159
being exposed there's kind of no there's

453
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,159
no coming back from

454
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,880
that there's kind of no coming back from

455
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,400
that that's what Ashley wants for

456
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,919
Anthony and let me be clear that nobody

457
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,000
over here cares if Ashley has money or

458
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,039
not that's not the problem it's the fact

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,080
that she's being ridiculously dishonest

460
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,360
about it and even publicly rebutting

461
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,400
what her own close friends who know her

462
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,880
situation personally said about her

463
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,880
wealth at the same time as Ashley's

464
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,320
trying to convince everyone that she's

465
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,520
so perfectly honest and morally

466
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,559
Superior the truth is that Ashley will

467
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,480
throw anybody under the bus even her own

468
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,039
friends who threaten The Masks she's

469
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,640
wearing as she's trying to portray

470
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
herself to be an everyday innocent Mommy

471
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,279
so that people are more likely to

472
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,400
believe her

473
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,000
lies Ashley's misrepresenting herself

474
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,360
just like she's misrepresented the

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,600
entire Stephanie story and just like she

476
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,000
continues to misrepresent Medical medium

477
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,679
information with every lie and every

478
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,200
falsity she's out there

479
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,960
pedaling here is again Ashley's response

480
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,200
to what Taylor and Robbie said about

481
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,840
her that said we don't own a plane like

482
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,080
they said in the

483
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,080
podcast they don't own a plane hm maybe

484
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,400
Ashley doesn't have a plane but her

485
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,880
family does or at least they did there's

486
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
obviously a reason why Robbie and Taylor

487
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,880
said what they did and Ashley's being

488
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
dishonest again just a minute ago you

489
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,520
heard what we read from Ashley from

490
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,039
another time in which she said

491
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:15,520
explicitly that her family has homes and

492
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,960
cars and planes all over the globe if

493
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
that wasn't enough there's also an

494
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,279
article on businesswire.com from 2017

495
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,679
about Ashley's father that

496
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,200
reads Dallas real estate entrepreneur

497
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,120
and philanthropist Jean e Phillips

498
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,240
offered his private plane for a

499
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,400
humanitarian flight to St Thomas in the

500
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,400
US Virgin Islands last

501
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:42,360
week her father offered up his plane not

502
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,400
a plane his plane there are also

503
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,159
multiple currently public posts on

504
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,640
Ashley's mother's Instagram account in

505
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,279
which the family can be seen on a

506
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,279
private jet like in this

507
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,520
video messing with the

508
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,520
dogs look at those dogs trying to bite

509
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,240
[Music]

510
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
me crazy dogs

511
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,799
right he wants to do it

512
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,120
again if you're listening to the podcast

513
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,360
version of this episode what you just

514
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,279
heard is the sound to a video of

515
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,279
Ashley's family on a private jet that

516
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,039
seems to be on its way to the location

517
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,720
tagged of kukio Hawaii it appears as

518
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,600
though Ashley's mother is recording the

519
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,679
video while Ashley's dad is holding

520
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,159
Ashley's daughter on his lap as he's

521
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,120
showing her something on his phone and

522
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:56,679
Ashley herself is in plain view talking

523
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:59,760
to someone behind him on the private jet

524
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,960
it was posted on June 25th of 2019 with

525
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,320
the caption quot memories Priceless as

526
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,600
if from a trip they had taken in

527
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,559
previous years it gets even crazier

528
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,840
there are two posts one from July 7th of

529
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,760
2018 and one from July 15th of 2018 with

530
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,960
photos of Ashley's kids on a private

531
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,919
plane with Ashley's dad the July 7th

532
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,480
2018 post is captioned quote we are

533
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,360
headed to

534
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Pennsylvania this was 4 months before

535
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,760
before Stephanie passed away and

536
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,960
Pennsylvania is where Stephanie

537
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,960
lived Ashley's family took the private

538
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,240
jet that Ashley's now claiming that they

539
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,200
don't have or have access to to the very

540
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,080
state in which Stephanie lived just four

541
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,360
months before Stephanie died and

542
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,399
yet Ashley did not visit Stephanie once

543
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,640
during the entire time she was sick we

544
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:02,679
know this because in a blog post Ashley

545
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,679
wrote on 7th of 2020 she said

546
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,799
this Steph went back home after a few

547
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,120
months and a relationship turned into

548
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,120
texts and occasional phone calls she was

549
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,200
the kind of friend I didn't talk to

550
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,720
every day but I never worried about it

551
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,880
because I knew the second I saw her

552
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,640
again it would be like we hadn't missed

553
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,640
a day unfortunately I wouldn't have that

554
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
chance

555
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,840
here Ashley is referring to a time when

556
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,360
Stephanie stayed with her in

557
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,480
2016 Ashley is saying in this post that

558
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,840
she never saw Stephanie again after that

559
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:49,919
time Stephanie passed away on November

560
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:53,039
13th of 2018 over 2 years later in an

561
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,039
Instagram post from March 6th of 20120

562
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,440
Ashley said something similar staff went

563
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,159
back home to Pennsylvania a few months

564
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,760
later and a relationship turned into

565
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,679
texts and occasional calls she was the

566
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,480
kind of friend I didn't talk to every

567
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,760
day but who I knew I would never miss a

568
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,919
beat with the second I saw her again

569
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,919
unfortunately I never

570
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,559
would Ashley's saying she would never

571
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,520
get the chance as if Stephanie had died

572
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,200
right after that but Ashley had over two

573
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,760
years of a

574
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,960
chance for someone who claim claims to

575
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,520
have cared so much about Stephanie that

576
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,720
Stephanie is the reason why she is so

577
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,039
determined to blatantly harm Anthony and

578
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,640
the medical medium Community it seems

579
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,279
just a little strange that Ashley did

580
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,360
not visit Stephanie once while Stephanie

581
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,520
was sick for two years Ashley clearly

582
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,360
has the means her family according to

583
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,159
her own words has quote cars and planes

584
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,279
and houses all over the globe and Ashley

585
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,320
appears to even have been on one of said

586
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,399
private planes with her family to

587
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,520
Pennsylvania just a few months before

588
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:09,120
Stephanie died in Pennsylvania and yet

589
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,039
Ashley still did not visit her instead

590
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,960
during that time that Stephanie was sick

591
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,960
Ashley was traveling to run Retreats

592
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,559
with her friends here is a text that

593
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,000
co-plot Taylor call had sent to a friend

594
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,000
on November 6th of

595
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,440
2018 I'm good just now back from

596
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,360
California the retreat was wonderful but

597
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,440
loads of work Gretchen was sick and in

598
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,679
the hospital the whole time so it was me

599
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Ash and Mel full

600
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,519
on that text was sent just seven days

601
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,159
before Stephanie passed away so for over

602
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,600
two years despite Ashley taking multiple

603
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,000
trips despite her having the time to run

604
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,399
Retreats despite the family using a

605
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,519
private jet to visit Pennsylvania where

606
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,559
Stephanie lived all while Stephanie was

607
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,519
sick Ashley didn't visit Stephanie

608
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,679
once instead Ashley was using that time

609
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,760
trying to become something in the health

610
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,039
industry using the medical medium name

611
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,919
in Ashley's blog post from 2020 where

612
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,480
she began pedalling her original false

613
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,000
story line about what happened with

614
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,159
Stephanie she told a massive additional

615
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,640
falsity I have absolutely no agenda I

616
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,519
don't make money off clients or my

617
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,559
Instagram I in potentially never have

618
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,240
and the reason for that is because of

619
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,760
how highly I value the truth I know it's

620
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,720
hard to trust people in the current

621
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,120
climate of social media and no one is

622
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,279
perfect but I want you guys to be able

623
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,279
to trust me as much as you choose

624
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,159
to As Nice And as trusting as that might

625
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,840
sound it's far from the truth and it's

626
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,640
incredibly manipulative Ashley clearly

627
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,120
had an agenda all along and Ashley has

628
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,600
very much made money off of her

629
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,960
Instagram or at least she's tried to and

630
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,279
she had every intention to do so I'm

631
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,320
going to go through some examples first

632
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,000
of all Ashley once had a platform on

633
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,679
Instagram of around 20,000 followers she

634
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
had this platform mostly because the

635
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,799
medical medium account was reposting her

636
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,480
and that's largely how her account grew

637
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,440
to what it was at the time Ashley then

638
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,120
used that platform built from the

639
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,200
medical medium Community to sell a

640
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,360
myriad of different digital products and

641
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,279
in-person events

642
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,080
one type of digital product Ashley made

643
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,760
money from was her ebooks that she

644
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,080
marketed on her Instagram account there

645
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,960
were three different ebooks and we have

646
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,440
receipts that were submitted To Us by

647
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,919
people who had purchased them from

648
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,279
Ashley in 2018 2019 and

649
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,519
2020 two of them were $7 each for PDF

650
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:54,120
copies and $15 each for hard copies and

651
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:59,240
one of them was $20 for a PDF copy and

652
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,200
$25 for a hard copy in 2018 through 2020

653
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,519
Ashley was promoting her offerings a lot

654
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,559
on social media Ashley shared

655
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,600
screenshots directly on her Instagram

656
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,440
stories that customers had taken of

657
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,159
their receipts from purchasing Ashley's

658
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,080
ebooks at the time of course Ashley

659
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,960
would share these receipts to try to

660
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,600
encourage more people to buy her ebooks

661
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,120
through her Instagram Ashley promoted

662
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,399

663
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,000

00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:27,640
posts but we're going to read off the

665
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,960
captions for just a few of them in one

666
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,760
post Ashley made during that time period

favor but what takes the cake out of all

725
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,760
of this is that Ashley actually released

726
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,360
her second ebook the day after Stephanie

727
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,960
passed away in her November 14th 2018

728
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,799
promotional post Ashley even casually

729
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,159
mentioned in the caption that a friend

730
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,519
of hers had died last night but that she

731
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,840
felt like it was still the right thing

732
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,080
to do to launch and start selling her

733
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,880
next ebook anyway Ashley is the daughter

734
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,159
of a billionaire it's not like she

735
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,240
needed the money she had no publisher

736
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,159
and no deadline this was an ebook Ashley

737
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,399
self-published she had the freedom to

738
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,000
release it at any time of her choosing

739
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,320
and she decided that the day after

740
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,080
Stephanie died

741
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,039
was the right time and then in the

742
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,159
caption of the promotional post Ashley

743
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,799
said

744
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:11,000
this I could use your help getting the

745
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,879
word out about this little book I just

746
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,040
didn't have the energy to do the

747
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,000
giveaways and the hype stuff to build

748
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,800
momentum for it but that's the way life

749
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
goes Ashley offered to donate some of

750
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,280
the proceeds of her book sales to relief

751
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,800
efforts for the woy fires that were

752
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,520
going on and affecting Ashley personally

753
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,200
at the time but not all of the proceeds

754
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,320
and again Ashley is the daughter of a

755
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,000
billionaire she doesn't need sales from

756
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,079
the medical medium Community to donate

757
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,040
to a cause what a bizarre time to try to

758
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,240
make money not even 24 hours after

759
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,200
Stephanie died that's the kind of thing

760
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:53,200
you do when you don't care about the

761
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,440
person who died but to each their

762
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,079
own so not only did Ashley lie about

763
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,280
never making money or trying to make

764
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,760
money off of her Instagram clearly she

765
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,680
did but Ashley even tried to make money

766
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,640
off of her Instagram the very next day

767
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,480
after Stephanie passed away and Ashley

768
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,040
was not only making money on Instagram

769
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,440
with her ebooks but she was also trying

770
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,560
desperately to make a name and a brand

771
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,720
for herself Ashley used the name of her

772
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,720
weight loss ebook and made a separate

773
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,760
Instagram account for it she did

774
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,880
Instagram lives promoting it she made a

775
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Facebook group for it she created an

776
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,960
Instagram hashtag for it and she used

777
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,480
the hashtag in a bunch of her posts and

778
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,040
encouraged other people to use the

779
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,640
hashtag too and Ashley wanted to do a

780
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,599
retreat in 2020 cator around this brand

781
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,079
she created one Instagram post she had

782
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,200
made a few years ago said

783
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:49,000
this I'm over here dreaming up holding

784
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,160
some Retreats this year based on my meal

785
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,839
plan Ashley also participated in a vegan

786
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,920
bundle with one of her ebooks another

787
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,280
Avenue of Ashley making money off of her

788
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,040
Instagram

789
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,880
we have a receipt that was submitted to

790
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,960
us from someone who purchased the bundle

791
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,520
with Ashley's ebook in it for $50 from

792
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,160
Ashley on February 7th of 2020 which was

793
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,599
just 4 days before Ashley started coming

794
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,520
out against medical medium and publicly

795
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,319
spreading false stories about

796
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,160
Stephanie think about this Ashley was

797
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:24,240
making money off of the medical medium

798
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,079
community Through Instagram 4 days

799
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,680
before coming out with her false story

800
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,040
for anyone who doesn't know how bundle

801
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,359
companies work I'll give you an example

802
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240
I was asked to be an affiliate for a

803
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,680
bundle company multiple times over the

804
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,440
past year I chose not to participate but

805
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,680
I was sent all of the information about

806
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,760
how the commission structure works the

807
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,280
vegan bundle that Ashley participated in

808
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,400
was a different type of bundle than the

809
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,680
one I was asked to be a part of but the

810
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,480
structure for all of them is very

811
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,599
similar so I'm going to read off parts

812
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,240
of the pitch that I received to give you

813
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
a peek into how much money Ashley could

814
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,720
have made from being a digital product

815
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,200
contributor in the vegan bundle and

816
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,000
selling and marketing it directly from

817
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,160
her Instagram account the pitch I

818
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,599
received said this in short we have over

819
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,240
100 creators come together and each add

820
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,920
their book or course as an affiliate you

821
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,240
would make $19 per bundle you sell I

822
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,680
sold 800 bundles are last

823
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,480
launch in the bundle companies Creator

824
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,960
section of their website participating

825
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,560
in the bundle is marketed to have the

826
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,599
following benefits it says why should I

827
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:32,079
join one high earnings two huge exposure

828
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,359
three followers love it and then in the

829
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,319
commission breakdown section it says if

830
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:38,160
you contribute with one or several of

831
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:41,440
your digital products in the bundle you

832
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,200
get 70% Commission of the net profit

833
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,079
which is $33 per bundle sold as somebody

834
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,040
contributing an ebook Ashley could have

835
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,480
gotten a similar commission making

836
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,920
around $33 per bundle she sold through

837
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,680
promoting it on her Instagram the person

838
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,079
who reached out to me with this proposal

839
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,240
said that they sold 800 bundle during

840
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,160
one 10day launch as an example so just

841
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,359
to piece all this together for everyone

842
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,040
if Ashley with her 20,000 followers at

843
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,839
the time would have sold even half of

844
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,359
the example amount that I was given for

845
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,079
a similar bundle and therefore made 400

846
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,839
sales at $33 commission per bundle sold

847
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,359
Ashley would have made

848
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,880
$13,200 in 10

849
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,640
days and again all of this is done

850
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,520
through marketing the bundles on

851
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,000
Instagram meaning that Ashley in fact

852
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,400
made money or tried to make money off of

853
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,720
her

854
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,079
Instagram once again Ashley misled

855
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,760
people we not only have proof that

856
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,160
Ashley did in fact make money or try to

857
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,800
make money off of her Instagram but we

858
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,240
also have proof that she got new

859
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,839
customers and likely made more money

860
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,319
after she started pedaling her false

861
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:52,680
storyline about

862
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:55,720
Stephanie here's a comment somebody made

863
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,160
to Ashley on Instagram on February 11th

864
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,079
of 2020 it says hi Ash I had no idea who

865
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,280
you were until today when your post

866
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,160
about your dear friend started

867
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,520
circulating social media first I'm so

868
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,680
sorry for the losses that you've

869
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,319
experienced and I'm hopeful that by

870
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,359
sharing this that it will help those of

871
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,040
us who follow Anthony make those hard

872
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,400
decisions about the inner section of

873
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,000
holistic wellness and life-saving modern

874
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,000
medicine so many of us have been so sick

875
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,040
for so long and we are vulnerable to a

876
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,440
message of healing even if it's tainted

877
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,400
or imperfect in some way thank you for

878
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,119
sharing your truth I think it's so

879
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,359
important to not follow anything or

880
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,760
anyone blindly although so many have

881
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,640
experienced healing with Anthony and I

882
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,079
was super excited to order all of your

883
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,040
books sending you lots of

884
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:45,079
love to begin with that person believed

885
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,800
I did what Ashley said I did Ashley

886
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:51,599
created a false story and that person

887
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,319
believed it and now that person believes

888
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,480
Ashley is doing a justifiable action

889
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,599
most likely that person will never hear

890
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,160
the truth and they're probably just gone

891
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,640
they left thinking that I hurt somebody

892
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,960
second she purchased all of Ashley's

893
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,240
books so Ashley made money selling books

894
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,040
on a platform that was built off of

895
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,319
medical medium and then at the same time

896
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,520
using a false story to do so in that

897
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,880
instance oh yeah and Ashley claimed that

898
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,760
she never made money on her Instagram

899
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,960
and here it is little old honest Ashley

900
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,319
once again being dishonest

901
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,079
even better than that Ashley's ebooks

902
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:36,599
are still available for purchase to this

903
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
day multiple people submitted receipts

904
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,400
to us from their purchases of Ashley's

905
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,079
ebooks in December of

906
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,440
2023 and Ashley wanted to make a whole

907
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,240
lot more money off of the medical medium

908
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,640
community Through many different Avenues

909
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,400
this was what she wanted one

910
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,400
money-making Avenue was through running

911
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,319
big Retreats first in 2016 Ashley began

912
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,520
by sending an email to let Anthony and

913
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,880
his wife know that she wanted to host a

914
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,400
retreat in Santa Monica California and

915
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,440
she asked them if they would would give

916
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,079
her and her Retreat a shout out then

917
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
later on in 2016 Ashley submitted a

918
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,400
business proposal to Anthony Ashley

919
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,319
wanted to do medical medium Retreats

920
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,200
with Anthony using the medical medium

921
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,800
name in the summer of

922
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,319
2017 in the business proposal which I

923
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
have in front of me Ashley included a

924
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,599
cost analysis and financial forecast for

925
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:32,280
150 attendees with a cost of attendance

926
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,920
of $3,000 per person and a total revenue

927
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,920
amount of

928
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,920
$450,000 it's worth noting that in this

929
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,359
2016 business proposal Ashley listed

930
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,760
Robbie Barbaro on the retreat itinerary

931
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,000
as someone who would have been teaching

932
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,480
classes at the medical medium Retreat

933
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,720
that she wanted to run and profit from

934
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,599
Ashley also stated in her business

935
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,359
proposal that quote by looking ahead to

936
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,000
2018 the quote event could grow up to

937
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:04,560
250 people if desired this shows that

938
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,240
Ashley's desire was to do medical medium

939
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,720
Retreats for years to come and to make

940
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,160
even more money with more people at

941
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,240
$3,000 per person with 250 people like

942
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,520
Ashley desired the revenue would have

943
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,520
been

944
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:25,160
$750,000 and then came a pivotal moment

945
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,400
in history Anthony turned it all down

946
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,119
and said no to Ashley's big Retreat

947
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,880
proposal I've always felt Ashley was not

948
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,680
looking out for the community and The

949
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,400
Chronic eel so much she was more into

950
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,800
what can Ashley get out of this and that

951
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,680
concerned

952
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,920
me Ashley got turned down and then

953
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,160
Ashley still had her mindset on doing

954
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,440
Retreats so she went forward with trying

955
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,760
to do them on her own we have a

956
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,480
screenshot from Ashley's old website in

957
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,559
which she had a spot she was using to

958
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:01,079
Market upcoming Retreats under upcoming

959
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,960
events it says summer Retreat 2017 check

960
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,760
back for more information

961
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,599
soon Ashley was trying to Market her own

962
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,480
retreat but it seems as though this

963
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,160
Retreat never ended up taking place

964
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,960
however Ashley still kept trying to move

965
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,000
forward to make her big retrieve

966
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,839
business plans happen here is a text

967
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,839
Ashley sent to someone on April 29th of

968
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,119
2018 would be fun to buy a small house

969
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,000
there and just set it up to do retreat

970
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:34,720
SS like comfy bunk beds in each room and

971
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,440
make it hold 10 to 12 people and then I

972
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,720
could fly into lead Retreats once a

973
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,160
month and make like 30 grand house would

974
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,160
pay for

975
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,559
itself and here is another text she sent

976
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,319
to the same person 3 days

977
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,079
later it would make even more sense for

978
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:59,680
me to just do like a full month of

979
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:03,680
Retreats twice a year and bring in

980
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,520
240k less with costs of course how much

981
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,440
cash do I need in the bank do you think

982
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,079
to get a loan on these houses I'd want

983
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,599
to do it without my

984
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:18,240
trust she's the daughter of a

985
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:21,160
billionaire family she has a trust fund

986
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,520
and she was trying to use medical medium

987
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,359
to make it big in the health industry

988
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,839
and she didn't want to dip into her

989
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,559
trust and I can promise you this her

990
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,839
trust fund doesn't just have $20,000 in

991
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,960
it I'm sure it

992
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,839
doesn't we've got the daughter of a

993
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,599
billionaire with a trust fund who's

994
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,800
trying to act like she can't even afford

995
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,760
a lawyer but she does have a lawyer by

996
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,280
the way everybody should know that and

997
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,680
she was trying to do medical medium

998
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,800
Retreats so that she could make

999
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,640
$240,000 a year from the chronically ill

1000
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,480
only have to show up for two months out

1001
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,119
of the year and she didn't want to dip

1002
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,880
into her trust fund amazing

1003
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,000
next I'm going to play voice text that

1004
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,079
Ashley sent to Anthony around that same

1005
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,240
time in 2018 asking him again about

1006
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,920
doing Retreats note that we are

1007
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,000
redacting the name of her child for

1008
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,640
privacy as you'll hear in the audios the

1009
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,720
Retreats were her and her friend's ideas

1010
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,720
Ashley reached out multiple times over

1011
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,839
the course of 17 days trying to get me

1012
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,599
on the phone trying to get me involved

1013
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,359
and still trying to use the medical

1014
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,800
medium name on them and get me to

1015
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:33,599
promote them and I was not interested

1016
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,200
and told her no this was many months

1017
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,079
after Stephanie was diagnosed with

1018
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,640
cancer and Ashley was trying to do

1019
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,640
business with

1020
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
me hey it's Ash I

1021
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,319
know got too

1022
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,040
bigle okay Budd um okay I know you

1023
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:56,440
talked to gret about this that she and I

1024
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,200
are trying to get some Retreat stuff

1025
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,040
going and she's doing one in Hawaii that

1026
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,760
I'm going to help her do the food for

1027
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,559
which will be really fun but we've also

1028
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,480
been talking about this main idea and um

1029
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,400
we're getting a proposal from them to do

1030
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,839
a retreat for a smaller group like you

1031
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,319
and I talked about of about 30 people

1032
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:19,400
this coming September and I just wanted

1033
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,559
to get a feel from you because I wasn't

1034
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,079
sure I kind of felt like you weren't

1035
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,119
really wanting to be involved in that

1036
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,920
which is totally fine I just wanted to

1037
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,200
make sure before we go ahead and see

1038
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,079
like is that something that you would

1039
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,000
want to do through medical medium at all

1040
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,119
and um if not we're going to just Market

1041
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,599
it as like a family Retreat where like

1042
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,599
the food happens to follow medical

1043
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,800
medium healing um guidelines and you

1044
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,720
know we'll be we'll run all our

1045
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,440
marketing by you guys just to make sure

1046
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,200
it's like on the up and up but um it

1047
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,240
wouldn't be like we would make sure to

1048
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,280
make it clear it's not like affiliated

1049
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,040
with medical medium so that's kind of

1050
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,760
what I'm thinking because I sort of got

1051
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,760
the vibe of like you're not sure about

1052
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,240
that yet but correct me if I'm wrong

1053
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,520
okay if you guys would like to

1054
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,480
be like have medical medium be the pH of

1055
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,280
something like that the idea I mean the

1056
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,920
retreat is just on a beautiful Retreat

1057
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,440
facility and there's hiking and beaches

1058
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,200
and a lake and we're not going to plan

1059
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,760
like too much for people it's mostly

1060
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,760
about you know a chance to get together

1061
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,559
with other people and all the food you

1062
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,960
know have the food done for you and just

1063
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,400
to rest and maybe there'll be like a

1064
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,160
cooking demo and some like guided

1065
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,960
meditations or something like that but

1066
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,520
nothing nothing super structured nothing

1067
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,119
real um formal it'll just be an

1068
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,720
opportunity for people to come take

1069
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,720
advantage of the

1070
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,280
location all I have to say just let me

1071
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,640
know if it's something you guys did do

1072
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,000
end up feeling like you want to be more

1073
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,319
through the mm Banner or if you're if

1074
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,319
you'd rather us just kind of take the

1075
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:02,240
lead and run with it and like I said

1076
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,040
we'll be we you know I'll check with you

1077
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,680
in case to make sure all our marketing

1078
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,800
is really clear in that case that it's

1079
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,160
not through you guys and and we won't

1080
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,160
we'll be careful with the wording and

1081
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,800
everything that first audio was sent on

1082
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,960
April 27th in 2018 Ashley did not get a

1083
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,680
response from Anthony and then Ashley

1084
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,880
sent another one nudging him further on

1085
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,520
May 14th

1086
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,880
hello good morning good afternoon I

1087
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,079
don't know where you are um this is the

1088
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,079
week we have to make a decision about

1089
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,200
the main Retreat we got a proposal back

1090
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:46,240
from Catherine at Point

1091
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,839
Lookout it suggests a cost of about

1092
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,000
41,000

1093
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:54,280
and that's with an estimate of 30 people

1094
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,319
30 adults and 10 children so the cost

1095
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,640
per person comes down to a little like

1096
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,640
around

1097
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,559
$1,100 per

1098
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,960
person

1099
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:07,400
so I think it has the potential to be a

1100
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,040
pretty good little test trial you know

1101
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,559
if we are thinking of a retreat cost of

1102
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,240
around

1103
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,559
$3,000

1104
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,960
um and it's really cool because if it

1105
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,960
did work next year we could do the same

1106
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,400
thing for 150 people and all of a sudden

1107
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,799
then it would really be generating some

1108
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,760
income let me know your thoughts it's

1109
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:29,880
obviously no pressure but we just are

1110
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,680
going to have to make some decisions

1111
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,960
about it this week

1112
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,400
so um any insight into what you're

1113
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,760
thinking and whether you guys would want

1114
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,400
to be involved would be awesome okay

1115
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,400
love you

1116
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,200
bye Ashley's saying here that the

1117
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,000
retreat she had been planning would just

1118
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,000
be a test trial she said that she wants

1119
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,200
to charge people $3,000 for the retreat

1120
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,640
and ultimately at some point host 150

1121
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,799
people which if you do the math would

1122
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:07,000
bring in almost half a million dollars

1123
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:10,000
half a million for one

1124
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,359
Retreat Anthony how did you respond to

1125
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,920
this prodding from Ashley I turned her

1126
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,880
down

1127
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,960
again right and then after you turned

1128
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,280
her down Ashley still tried to pursue

1129
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,880
doing Retreats on her own to whomever

1130
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,000
she could sell them to Ashley did end up

1131
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,599
hting a retreat later on with now

1132
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,400
co-plot Taylor and Gretchen and they had

1133
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,920
a total of 12

1134
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,160
attendees I'm sure that 12 attendees

1135
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,559
made Ashley a lot less money than the

1136
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,680
150 to 250 attendees that Ashley was

1137
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,000
hoping to get from doing Retreats with

1138
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,200
Anthony using his name and

1139
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,839
likeness Ashley's retreat with Taylor

1140
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,640
and Gretchen took place in aahu Hawaii

1141
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:55,359
from October 15th through the 21st in

1142
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,160
2018 this Retreat ended just 3 and A2

1143
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,480
weeks before Stephanie passed pass away

1144
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,319
in the marketing that was done to

1145
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,040
promoted on Instagram the details of the

1146
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:06,480
retreat included quote all organic

1147
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,359
plant-based grainfree meals in line with

1148
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,119
the medical medium protocol and quote

1149
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,160
cooking classes led by

1150
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:18,000
Ashley so again Ashley was too busy to

1151
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,760
visit Stephanie once while she was sick

1152
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,240
but she certainly wasn't too busy to

1153
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,760
travel from where she was living in

1154
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,359
California to Hawaii and run Retreats

1155
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,520
using medical medium

1156
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:31,040
information and then even over a year

1157
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,920
after Stephanie passed away Ashley was

1158
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,160
still trying to run medical medium

1159
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,880
Retreats Ashley ended up trying to sell

1160
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,680
a retreat that she would have hosted

1161
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,040
along with Gretchen in

1162
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,200
2020 initially The Retreat dates were

1163
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,200
going to be August 31st to September 5th

1164
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,920
of 2020 initially Ashley had said that

1165
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,319
she wanted to add a second week to that

1166
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,880
but then she changed her mind Ashley

1167
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:56,960
marketed this Retreat all over her

1168
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,079
Instagram in early 2020 just literal

1169
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,559
weeks before she came out with her false

1170
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:04,559
Stephanie story in one Instagram post

1171
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,440
Ashley started describing the retreat by

1172
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,599
saying

1173
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,160
this cost is

1174
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:16,680
$3,800 for the week all meals daily

1175
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,680
hiking and yoga and celery juice

1176
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:22,000
included in that same Instagram story

1177
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,440
post Ashley included a blurry photo of

1178
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,599
random people swimming in the ocean she

1179
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,040
Drew an arrow pointing to two of them

1180
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,160
and said

1181
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:35,240
this I recognize that these are random

1182
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,240
people but this could be you and

1183
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,319
me in the next Instagram story Ashley

1184
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:46,200
said this I know it's expensive but if

1185
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:50,640
you find a Budd and save $10 a day

1186
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,640
between now and then you can both

1187
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,599
come Ashley then did a series of

1188
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,720
promotional Instagram stories for the

1189
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:03,000
retreat one said

1190
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:06,000
this OMG you guys I booked it I'm

00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,160

this table with

1193
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,040
me she also included a poll in this post

1194
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,280
with one option being yes and the other

1195
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:20,319
option being yes also next to a photo of

1196
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,720
an outdoor table overlooking the beach

1197
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,920
then Ashley posted a very blurry photo

1198
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:29,640
of a bed and said

1199
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,920

posts for this Retreat on her Instagram

1203
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,119

00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,000

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,799

something here in laay in May more on

1207
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:55,400
that after I fill up

1208
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,920
Hawaii so Ashley planned to continue on

1209
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,680
doing retreats and making money Ashley

1210
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,599
then had two long-standing story

1211
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,359
highlights up on her Instagram in 2020

1212
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,280
one was for marketing her Retreat and

1213
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,000
the other was for marketing one of her

1214
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,400
ebooks in addition to those Retreats on

1215
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,520
her former website Ashley marketed a

1216
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,160
variety of different offerings a dinner

1217
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,079
party she hosted in

1218
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,319
2018 a wellness week private retreat for

1219
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,079
two people in

1220
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:26,440
2019 a cooking class and meal planning

1221
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:29,280
workshop that Ashley charged $150 per

1222
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,000
person for in 2018 and a virtual meal

1223
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,760
planning workshop that Ashley charged

1224
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,359
$60 per person for in

1225
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,520
2018 Ashley also had an Amazon

1226
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:40,680
storefront she linked products like

1227
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,200
vimer G's barleygrass juice powder which

1228
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,119
Ashley described by saying

1229
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,400
this one of the supplements I take every

1230
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,599
single day I filed it under Beauty

1231
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,680
because it has helped my hair growing so

1232
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,680
thick and

1233
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,480
shiny Ashley had plenty of plans for

1234
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,640
making money off of the medical medium

1235
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,119
community Through many other avenues as

1236
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,160
well in 2016 Ashley submitted a proposal

1237
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,040
to Anthony's wife in which Ashley

1238
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,760
offered to invest in getting a YouTube

1239
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,720
channel going for medical medium Ashley

1240
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,119
proposed doing a 5050 Revenue split

1241
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,400
Ashley wanted 50% of all of the medical

1242
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:19,960
medium YouTube earnings this is

1243
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,280
something that never ended up panning

1244
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,440
out and so just so everyone is clear to

1245
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,640
this day I do not accept money from

1246
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,680
YouTube this was Ashley calculating and

1247
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,920
planning some kind of financial Endeavor

1248
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,160
that she wanted to do with me that

1249
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,799
wasn't about money going back into the

1250
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,359
community with more free resources

1251
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,480
instead it was Ashley hoping to make

1252
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:47,520
money for herself classic

1253
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,839
Ashley we also have texts that Ashley

1254
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:54,839
sent to a health practitioner friend on

1255
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:58,119
November 7th of 2017 they said

1256
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:01,359
this what if we did an ebook

1257
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:04,559
specifically for the postpartum period

1258
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:07,320
And if we kept it short and sweet we

1259
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,200
could release it for like $10 or

1260
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,559
[Music]

1261
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,920
something we could possibly talk to an

1262
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,559
and rage and see if they want to do it

1263
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,200
through medical medium like we could

1264
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:22,240
design the whole thing but they could

1265
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:26,480
release it as an mm ebook or something

1266
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:28,640
so much more reach that way

1267
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,319
again this was taking place during the

1268
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,720
time that Stephanie was sick instead of

1269
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,839
visiting Stephanie Ashley was using that

1270
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,200
time trying to become something in the

1271
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,799
health industry using the medical medium

1272
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,799
name another text she sent to the same

1273
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:48,720
friend on March 27th of 2018

1274
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,520
reads I know I wrote a whole book last

1275
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:57,839
year and then realized I had to do a

1276
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,839
proposal and still haven't started lol

1277
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:04,240
on May 15th of 2018 the friend asked

1278
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:06,000
when is your ebook launch so exciting

1279
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,960
and Ashley

1280
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,280
replied H probably in another two weeks

1281
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,039
or so I know so much exciting stuff

1282
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,240
these days I'm cooking for Gretchen's

1283
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:22,079
retreat in October I decided to host the

1284
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,319
one-day cooking class of my very own

1285
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:28,720
this August and the ebook

1286
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,720
I'm talking to an agent today about

1287
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:37,839
doing my own cookbook we're remodeling

1288
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:41,079
the playroom and the yard my head is

1289
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:43,039
spinning around this time Ashley had

1290
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:45,760
asked me to co-author a medical medium

1291
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,200
recipe book with her and I said no and

1292
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
turned her

1293
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,640
down it looks like after Ashley got

1294
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,680
turned down on co-authoring a medical

1295
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,440
medium book Ashley then went around

1296
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,359
trying to pursue a book deal on her own

1297
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,720
and Ashley was desperately trying to

1298
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:05,520
grow a following on social media here is

1299
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,520
a text she sent to a friend in

1300
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,280
2017 had a meeting with a marketing

1301
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,319
consultant

1302
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,720
yesterday the friend responded by asking

1303
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:18,119
is this for your brand for your book and

1304
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,119
Ashley

1305
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,599
replied I basically just have to get my

1306
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,880
numbers up before I post all the random

1307
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,079
baby photos and stuff yeah

1308
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,960
every time I post something other than

1309
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:35,440
food I lose about 10 followers which

1310
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:37,720
adds up so I have to sort of streamline

1311
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:42,039
and

1312
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:45,160
focus in the same text thread Ashley

1313
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:47,760
said up for a little friendly

1314
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,319
competition I just want to like I don't

1315
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,280
know I need some inspiration to get

1316
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,760
serious about growing my insta so I

1317
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,920
thought you might be down for a little

1318
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:02,280
challenge like one to gain 10K or

1319
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:05,359
something we can put some fun Stakes on

1320
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,480
it Ashley was regularly asking this

1321
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,240
person for advice on how to grow her

1322
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,119
social media following in another text

1323
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,000
she

1324
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,200
asked question did your IG growth slow

1325
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,720
down so much because you're only posting

1326
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:23,400
less frequently how many times do you

1327
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:28,079
think one needs to pose to

1328
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:31,079
grow after receiving advice at said this

1329
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,640
okay I've been trying to post one today

1330
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,680
and I like lose followers at that rate

1331
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,960
LOL it seems like if you start a YouTube

1332
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,960
channel you get way more followers

1333
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,960
without posting as

1334
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:48,280
much after receiving advice again a

1335
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:51,160
couple days later Ashley said

1336
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,920
this I finally have been consistent

1337
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,760
enough with insta where I'm not losing

1338
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,559
followers at least once a day posting

1339
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,680
results in like super slow growth like

1340
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:05,760
10 new a day or

1341
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,440
so on a later date frustrated with not

1342
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,079
seeing the growth she so desired Ashley

1343
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,079
sent this

1344
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:21,680
text I'm posting twice a day on IG

1345
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,680
really top quality photos and seeing no

1346
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,680
growth she got some more advice from

1347
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,599
this person on Switching up her hashtags

1348
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,319
and then several hours later Ashley

1349
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:33,720
texted

1350
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:36,280
back okay I changed them up to see if it

1351
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:38,240
helps got a little boost from switching

1352
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,039
them

1353
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,599
up okay so Ashley had a meeting with an

1354
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,160
agent about getting herself a book deal

1355
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,119
Ashley had a meeting with a marketing

1356
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,240
consultant and then she was trying

1357
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,920
really hard to grow her social media

1358
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,480
following Anthony can you explain for

1359
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,960
listeners how book deals work and why

1360
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,760
this was so important to her

1361
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,880
it was a different world back in 2018 it

1362
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,359
was before influencers could become

1363
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,599
famous on social media you either got

1364
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:09,880
somewhere on television acting music

1365
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,640
getting signed in a record deal

1366
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:15,280
something in sports or in publishing

1367
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,200
getting a book deal maybe it was before

1368
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,680
the time period we're living in now

1369
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,960
where someone hits their grandmother

1370
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,079
over the head with a 2x4 and gets 20

1371
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,039
million views and the person who hit the

1372
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,440
grandmother over the head with the 2x4

1373
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,640
has endorsement deal

1374
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:33,000
the world has changed Ashley was

1375
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,440
desperate to get a book deal desperate

1376
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,880
to become somebody Ashley wanted to

1377
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,240
co-author a book with me she was very

1378
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:44,079
entitled and raised that way and she

1379
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,319
expected to co-author a book with me she

1380
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:50,640
expected it I said no for a multitude of

1381
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:53,039
reasons and I'm so glad I said no

1382
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,920
because this is the kind of person she

1383
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,920
is back then I noticed that when I spoke

1384
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,880
to Ashley she would say something and

1385
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,920
then the second time she said it it

1386
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,200
would be different I didn't trust her I

1387
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,640
said no so Ashley tried to get a book

1388
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,839
deal on her own and in order to get a

1389
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,359
book deal on her own she needed a

1390
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:15,520
certain number of followers so Ashley

1391
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:17,760
was trying to learn from people like

1392
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,319
Robbie her best friend one of the other

1393
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,200
plotters how to build followers on her

1394
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,000
Instagram

1395
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,559
Facebook that makes sense so clearly

1396
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Ashley was trying to make a name for

1397
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,680
herself and build a platform for herself

1398
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,720
she ultimately wanted to be famous she

1399
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,079
was definitely also trying to make money

1400
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,839
the claims Ashley made when she was

1401
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,760
trying to get people to trust her with

1402
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,720
her fake Stephanie story that she never

1403
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,160
made money off of her Instagram and

1404
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:47,520
intentionally never did because of how

1405
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,559
much she quote values the truth are flat

1406
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:53,839
out lies Ashley was using Instagram to

1407
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,400
sell ebooks Retreats bundles and more

1408
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,000
and let's be clear making money off of

1409
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,200
Instagram is fine that's not the problem

1410
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,400
but why did Ashley feel the need to lie

1411
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,880
about it furthermore Ashley even tried

1412
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,760
to pursue another Avenue for profit by

1413
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,400
offering to invest in a brand that

1414
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,599
Anthony endorses here is the text she

1415
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:17,160
had sent to the owner of that

1416
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:19,119
company also bear this in mind if you

1417
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,880
ever decide you want to do a big push

1418
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,880
with vimergy and take on some investment

1419
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:28,160
and try and grow it up quick let me know

1420
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,160
i' do it with y'all in a

1421
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:34,039
heartbeat there you have it Ashley got

1422
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:38,279
turned down on this proposal as

1423
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:41,400
well Ashley Foster always gets her way

1424
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:44,880
no one's allowed to tell Ashley no if

1425
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:47,960
they do Ashley will turn on them anyone

1426
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,400
who tells her no will pay the price it's

1427
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,400
who she

1428
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,599
is not only did Ashley eagerly want to

1429
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,160
invest in vimergy but this is also a

1430
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:59,400
company that has products that before

1431
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,720
Ashley got upset and turned on everyone

1432
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,920
Ashley said she used every day and that

1433
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,640
helped her hair quote grow in so thick

1434
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,160
and

1435
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,319
shiny now after being turned down by

1436
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,599
them years ago Ashley and her hateful

1437
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,240
group repeatedly attacked this company

1438
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,960
along with Anthony and the medical

1439
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,279
medium Community after we released the

1440
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,880
plotter podcast episodes last year in

1441
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:23,119
another post Ashley made as she was

1442
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,440
trying to say face she said

1443
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:29,039
this something that really bothers me me

1444
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,760
is how Anthony claimed in his podcast

1445
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,920
that we were doing this for money but at

1446
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,480
the same time claims that we must be

1447
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,079
part of some evil plot because we have

1448
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:44,520
money which one is

1449
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:46,799
it this is inaccurate if you listen back

1450
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,839
this instead is what was actually said

1451
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,839
in our first podcast

1452
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,039
episode what I learned is that the

1453
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,799
strategy of this group is to try to

1454
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:00,960
capture people people like those young

1455
01:04:57,799 --> 01:05:03,240
women with a manipulated story of a

1456
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,319
deceased person who isn't here anymore

1457
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,599
to speak for herself or to defend the

1458
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:09,359
truth of what actually happened they

1459
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,400
might throw in some other random

1460
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:13,480
misinformation to add to their story of

1461
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,520
why you shouldn't trust medical medium

1462
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,960
because they try to act like they have

1463
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,599
some special information that you just

1464
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,319
don't know even though all these people

1465
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,240
still admitted to applying medical

1466
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,839
medium information into their own lives

1467
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,920
yet they say that they don't trust you

1468
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:30,240
they just don't they they explicitly say

1469
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,359
that they don't credit The Source they

1470
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,520
use it and don't credit the source and I

1471
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,640
literally heard them out on all of their

1472
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,720
points for a total of over 17 hours and

1473
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,839
I can tell you that everything that they

1474
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,960
think they have is a bunch of Twisted

1475
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:48,240
misinformation their false narrative

1476
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,559
story is the guise that they're using

1477
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,279
but what these calls also made clear to

1478
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,680
me is that some of these sources are

1479
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:58,039
part of this plan because they're

1480
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,880
actually being driven by some of it is

1481
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:04,599
misplaced grief some of it is people

1482
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,760
being driven by guilt but most of them

1483
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:08,640
disturbingly are being driven by

1484
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,640
self-interests and what they would stand

1485
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:14,440
to gain financially and otherwise from

1486
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,440
the impact of a medical medium

1487
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:20,319
takedown I stand by all of that Ashley

1488
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:23,319
always gets it wrong first as you can

1489
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,760
hear it was me who said this not Anthony

1490
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:27,799
hi Ashley I did not say that you were of

1491
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,520
a plot because you have money your

1492
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:32,640
friend Taylor called you out for having

1493
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,000
a lot of money like private jet plus her

1494
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,640
words I said that I suspected that the

1495
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,200
plotters had mixed motives we didn't

1496
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,839
mention the fact that some of them have

1497
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,160
money and some of them don't have money

1498
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,880
and there are plenty of extremely

1499
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,279
wealthy people out there including

1500
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,240
billionaires and Daughters of

1501
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:51,039
billionaires who never stop wanting to

1502
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,000
make more money what Ashley said is a

1503
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,039
false dichotomy in fact Ashley knows

1504
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,520
that this is a false dichotomy

1505
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:01,359
in text messages she sent to a friend in

1506
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,920
2017 Ashley used the following words to

1507
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,839
describe her own father who had long

1508
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,200
since been a billionaire and his

1509
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,200
business

1510
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,319
dealings he's trying to build something

1511
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:17,400
bigger and bigger and bigger I think

1512
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,240
he's just addicted to the game he's a

1513
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:24,119
real true addict the rush of the

1514
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:26,680
gambling element is so addictive to

1515
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,720
him well Ashley was applying medical

1516
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,880
medium information she wanted to do

1517
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,599
high-profit Retreats without dipping

1518
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:36,200
into her trust fund admitting in that

1519
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,200
very text that she has money but that

1520
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,880
she wants to make more Ashley was

1521
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,880
selling eBooks she was working with

1522
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,000
bundle companies she wanted to be an

1523
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,599
author she was meeting with marketing

1524
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,240
consultants she wanted to grow a

1525
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:50,400
following she wanted to run the medical

1526
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,520
medium YouTube channel for 50% of the

1527
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,640
earnings she wanted to have a stake in a

1528
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,319
company endorsed by medical medium and

1529
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,799
more

1530
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,760
Ashley also talked about wanting to do a

1531
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:04,079
positive medical medium documentary on

1532
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:07,000
Me on the light blast years ago she had

1533
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,119
her sight set on it she was obsessed

1534
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,680
with

1535
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:12,680
it okay so this is going to be shocking

1536
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,680
for people listening to hear to hear

1537
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,120
that so Ashley has wanted to make a

1538
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:20,600
documentary in some way shape or form

1539
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:23,440
about you for a long time this goes way

1540
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,759
back one of the most interesting things

1541
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,640
I've seen from Ashley is that one of her

1542
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,480
longest standing goals has been to

1543
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:33,239
become successful specifically in the

1544
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,799
film industry in a blog post Ashley

1545
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:40,239
wrote in 2010 she described a rule book

1546
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:43,040
she had for herself one of her rules was

1547
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:46,359
this right did you write

1548
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,600
today right and the writing you do today

1549
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:51,799
must eventually lead to a successful

1550
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,799
career in the film

1551
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,120
industry as you just heard Ashley has

1552
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,480
always wanted to be successful in the

1553
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,679
film industry Ashley's husband is also a

1554
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,560
documentary cinematographer I'm sure

1555
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:07,679
that he wants to be well known for that

1556
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,640
can you describe for everyone Anthony

1557
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,679
what the proposal that Ashley made to

1558
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,560
you years ago for a positive medical

1559
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,839
medium documentary was

1560
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:19,040
like Ashley was so fixated at wanting to

1561
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:21,759
do a documentary she asked me about it

1562
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:24,640
first on the phone she asked a mutual

1563
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,839
friend about it over and over again that

1564
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,839
mutual friend brought it up to my wife

1565
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:32,440
and I again and was in conversation with

1566
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,560
Ashley about it Ashley wanted to write

1567
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,839
and control the content of the

1568
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,600
documentary she wanted her husband to

1569
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:42,120
film it and she wanted her sister to

1570
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,040
edit it over the years I've been

1571
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:47,400
approached many times by big producers

1572
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,960
media companies and networks about doing

1573
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,080
a medical medium documentary or TV show

1574
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,360
my wife and I thought it'd be great to

1575
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,040
get people's healing stories and more

1576
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,239
information out there there to help the

1577
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,960
chronically ill at some point but we

1578
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:04,440
wouldn't have gone to Ashley to do a

1579
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,760
documentary we entertained Ashley's

1580
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:10,000
ideas but then we quickly became

1581
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:13,239
concerned about what Ashley was

1582
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,440
saying so I have that text thread in

1583
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:17,560
front of me your wife initiates a

1584
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,360
conversation with Ashley about it after

1585
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,760
Ashley had been prodding about doing a

1586
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,239
documentary for a while Ashley says that

1587
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,600
she had thought about doing the

1588
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:28,159
documentary idea a lot and then she gets

1589
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,199
into her proposal she starts describing

1590
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,120
some of her

1591
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:35,080
ideas I like the idea of following a new

1592
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,719
client we could even fake that part of

1593
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,719
it

1594
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:43,440
LOL it can be an actor that recreates a

1595
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:46,000
storyline that is true that's frequently

1596
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,000
done for

1597
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,840
documentaries this sounds super sketchy

1598
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,320
very weird of Ashley to suggest being

1599
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,080
dishonest and to say that that's

1600
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:58,640
frequently done in documentaries

1601
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,840
after your wife politely responds

1602
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,960
interesting Ashley right away changes

1603
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,400
her mind on the idea that she herself

1604
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:10,199
just presented the actor idea is no good

1605
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:15,760
if someone got wind of it it would be

1606
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:15,760
real bad but it is common

1607
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,760
LOL these were more signs we saw first

1608
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,679
hand of Ashley being manipulative and

1609
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,239
dishonest it made us really really

1610
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,239
uncomfortable

1611
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,120
right after Ashley's last message your

1612
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:33,600
wife changes the subject and ends the

1613
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:36,280
documentary conversation so I'm guessing

1614
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,440
you guys had turned her down on that

1615
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,960
sketchy proposal as well yeah in the

1616
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,239
nicest way possible she kept asking

1617
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,360
about it and prodding and it's something

1618
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:49,400
we were never going to do with her we

1619
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,520
didn't want to disappoint Ashley but we

1620
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:54,920
just were not on the same page about it

1621
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:58,199
at all for Ashley to suggest altering a

1622
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,120
docu doumentary so it becomes dishonest

1623
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:02,960
was unimaginable for a medical medium

1624
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:06,400
documentary we were sitting there

1625
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:09,480
wondering why on Earth is Ashley telling

1626
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:12,920
us this is how you do a documentary you

1627
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,120
fabricated in a dishonest way this was a

1628
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,880
shocker to

1629
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:21,239
us yeah so Ashley wanted her hand in

1630
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,800
every pot with you I'm sure that she saw

1631
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:25,400
you as a ticket to success everybody

1632
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,600
knows that you're one of the biggest he

1633
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,560
authors in the world Ashley was trying

1634
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,760
to use the medical medium name to get

1635
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,400
herself and her husband somewhere and

1636
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,600
she ended up getting turned down from

1637
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,560
basically every angle Ashley had spent

1638
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,440
years trying to pursue all these

1639
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,520
different Avenues and they were

1640
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,840
unsuccessful Ashley was struggling to

1641
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,000
grow a following she got turned down on

the film industry like she wanted to she

1653
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:13,520
got turned down on her proposal to do an

1654
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,560
inspirational documentary about medical

1655
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,159
medium that she wanted her husband to

1656
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:21,880
film and her sister to

1657
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,760
edit was Ashley upset with you I mean

1658
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,080
how did she respond to all of this

1659
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:29,080
rejection at the time

1660
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:31,639
she was disappointed and frustrated

1661
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:34,639
Ashley wanted desperately to have a hand

1662
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:36,400
in Everything Medical medium everything

1663
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:39,719
she wanted a piece of everything I was

1664
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:42,040
doing and now look what she's doing

1665
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:44,360
because she didn't get her way Ashley's

1666
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,440
not used to being told no it's an

1667
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:49,600
entitlement and an ego thing when Ashley

1668
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,880
realized she wasn't going to be able to

1669
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,719
get all of these high-profile business

1670
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,679
deals with me she flipped the switch was

1671
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,639
flipped

1672
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,400
and she started making things up that

1673
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:03,120
didn't exist she started working on her

1674
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,880
false story lines and any communication

1675
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,159
she had with me of any kind or anybody I

1676
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,840
was associated with she started to try

1677
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:13,199
to twist and rewrite history so she

1678
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,159
could tell people a disturbing story

1679
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,440
that never existed and then she decided

1680
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:21,520
to take her stories to the media to try

1681
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:24,280
to hurt me and the

1682
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,280
community and you turned her down on

1683
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:29,000
these deals years ago because you had

1684
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:31,239
concerns about her intentions I turned

1685
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,760
her down for multiple reasons first of

1686
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:36,120
all every time someone I knew would talk

1687
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,960
to Ashley they would be left shaking

1688
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,840
their heads because it seemed that

1689
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,320
nothing that came out of Ashley's mouth

1690
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,920
was totally accurate she was 5050 at

1691
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:50,600
best 50% mixed in accurate things with

1692
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,880
50% mixed in completely wrong inaccurate

1693
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,159
information and it was obvious to me

1694
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,960
that Ashley was only wanting to be be

1695
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:59,239
involved with medical medium because of

1696
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,360
her wanting to start a business

1697
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:05,159
involving me or use me to launch her

1698
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:07,679
business and I knew this about Ashley

1699
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:10,560
it's not that I'm saying it's bad she

1700
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,480
wants to become somebody it's bad that

1701
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:17,560
her desire was to become somebody using

1702
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:19,760
me and then when I said no afterwards

1703
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:22,040
trying to destroy the medical medium

1704
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,360
community and me because she didn't get

1705
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:27,639
her way even if there was a world Where

1706
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,320
I Was Naive enough to give Ashley all

1707
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:32,639
that she wanted a book deal with me big

1708
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:36,239
Retreats with my name on them

1709
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:39,320
$750,000 like pop documentaries for her

1710
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:41,360
and her husband money made from those

1711
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,560
Ventures which could have equated to

1712
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,320
Millions would have been taken from the

1713
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,639
community and not invested back into the

1714
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,560
community on any level it would have

1715
01:15:48,639 --> 01:15:55,000
been selfs serving as we'll cover later

1716
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,320
on Ashley is so cheap she wouldn't Buy

1717
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,560
Stephanie a coach plane ticket to help

1718
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:03,000
Stephanie get out to Ashley's family's

1719
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,440
Pebble Beach mansion and money that I've

1720
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,639
made from working around the clock a big

1721
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,719
portion of that money goes back into

1722
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:11,960
producing free everything for the

1723
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:14,520
community if there was a world where I

1724
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:17,400
was naive enough to let Ashley go into

1725
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,199
multiple business deals with me all that

1726
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,600
money would have been

1727
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,719
squandered Penny pinched and

1728
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,280
self-serving for her children and her

1729
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:27,719
lifestyle so that she can can have

1730
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,800
expensive vacations and grandiose

1731
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:32,880
dinners with friends all while I will

1732
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,040
still be standing in my kitchen eating a

1733
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,120
steamed potato standing up working 20

1734
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:41,840
hours a day to get the next book out so

1735
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:44,120
people can heal an example of how Ashley

1736
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,520
works is that she wanted to make all

1737
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:50,360
this money from you the community that

1738
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,280
doesn't have money so she's didn't have

1739
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:56,480
to touch her trust fund a trust fund

1740
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,719
with an exorbitant amount of money in it

1741
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,280
it would have been unfair to the

1742
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:04,760
community that Ashley was making a

1743
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:06,920
killing off their backs I could not live

1744
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:09,320
with that so I chose not to do a

1745
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,760
documentary with her I chose not to let

1746
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,800
her co-author books with me and I chose

1747
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,679
not to go into the retreat business with

1748
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:19,719
her using my name Ashley would have made

1749
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:22,880
a killing so that she could avoid using

1750
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:25,520
her trust fund from her billionaire

1751
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,080
father now after I turned her down and

1752
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,239
she didn't get what she wanted Ashley is

1753
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,040
trying to become famous through

1754
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:35,600
pretending to be a whistleblower

1755
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,159
spreading lies false claims and

1756
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,239
disinformation and trying to frame me

1757
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:44,159
along with her partner Tony tazone

1758
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:46,960
Stephanie's brother who as one of the

1759
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:49,520
plotters said is just looking for

1760
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:52,480
someone to blame according to another

1761
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,320
plotter Tony has multiple fake accounts

1762
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:59,199
on social media platforms and and he may

1763
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:02,480
not realize it but he's doing Ashley's

1764
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:05,120
bidding she's stoking the Flames of his

1765
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,560
grief and anger and Tony doesn't know

1766
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:11,040
why Ashley's really on this Mission

1767
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,800
she's using him Ashley has recruited

1768
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:17,120
other people to spread her lies for her

1769
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,040
we have Insider information that she's

1770
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,600
promising the people who are supporting

1771
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:25,320
her a spot in a documentary ultimately

1772
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:27,920
Ashley's goal is now to make it

1773
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,080
somewhere in the film industry by trying

1774
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,560
to get a deal for a negative hitpiece

1775
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:36,360
documentary about me and to take the

1776
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,719
medical mum Community down in the

1777
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:40,040
process I also want to ask you this

1778
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:43,280
because I know that there will be people

1779
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:46,360
out there wondering about spirit and if

1780
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:49,360
Ashley was capable of all of this

1781
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,960
spinning stories and lying to harm you

1782
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,280
and attacking the medical medium

1783
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,960
Community then can you explain why why

1784
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,760
did let you engage with her at all

1785
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,840
Spirit told me not to engage with Ashley

1786
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:06,560
and I voiced that to my friends Ashley

1787
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:09,040
was a friend of a friend I communicated

1788
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,840
with Ashley very little I kept her at

1789
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,600
arms length when I got off the phone

1790
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:17,800
after one of my first calls with her I

1791
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:20,920
said to my wife no she is not a good

1792
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:24,840
person she seems empty and soulless and

1793
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:27,600
not genuine and Spirits given me a war

1794
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,639
warning but I gave it a chance because I

1795
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,280
always keep faith that people will heal

1796
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:35,320
their mental state Spirit gave me the

1797
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,280
potential that Ashley could be an

1798
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,400
ill-intentioned person but you can only

1799
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,159
hope that someone uses their free will

1800
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:46,040
to do good things and not harmful things

1801
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:48,239
despicable things abusive things and I

1802
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,040
didn't want to let a mutual friend down

1803
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:53,280
who was wanting me to connect with

1804
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:56,960
Ashley for somebody that said I saved

1805
01:19:53,280 --> 01:20:00,280
her and her sister's life and to turn so

1806
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,320
dark and to lie so much really brings me

1807
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:05,960
a new understanding of what people can

1808
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:08,320
be I mean you expect out there in the

1809
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:12,199
world for things to go wrong but you

1810
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:15,679
never expect a mom to be so conniving

1811
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:19,280
and just plain evil she built the whole

1812
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,679
thing off of originally I never told

1813
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:25,360
Stephanie to see a doctor which was a

1814
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:28,080
lie that alone is sick if you think are

1815
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:31,400
falsities lies and fabricated stories

1816
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,320
about me are harmful and ridiculous now

1817
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,840
what would have happened if I didn't

1818
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:38,719
keep Ashley at arms

1819
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,400

01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:55,840
two whole years and despite Ashley

1852
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,800
having all of the means in the world the

1853
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,080
convenience of a private jet that even

1854
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,760
went directly to Pennsylvania where

1855
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,920
Stephanie lived and somehow the time to

1856
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,639
be able to travel for other purposes

1857
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,360
like to host Retreats that she was

of Ashley did not visit Stephanie

1860
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:17,480
once what Ashley's doing is not about

1861
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:19,960
Stephanie Ashley has exploited and used

1862
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,280
Stephanie now along with multiple others

1863
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,040
as well and because her Twisted

1864
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,320
Stephanie story didn't do the damage she

1865
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:28,639
desperately wanted it to Ashley's now

1866
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:31,360

1869
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,199
vendetta against you because she didn't

get what she wanted from you that's

1871
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:42,360

fame The Retreat deal the book deal the

1873
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,199
followers or the positive documentary

1874
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:49,000
deal that she wanted and now that she

1875
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:51,040
didn't get what she wanted from you

1876
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,159

1878
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:56,880

documentary about you so that she can

1880
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,880
become famous and successful that

1881
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:04,840
way this isn't some whistleblower who

1882
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,520
walked away because of Integrity Ashley

1883
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,440
is trying hard to convince her followers

1884
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,520
that she is such an honest and

1885
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,520
transparent person yet Ashley has not

1886
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,600
publicly disclosed the fact that she had

1887
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:19,800
every desire to make money and become

1888
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,920
somebody using medical medium Ashley has

1889
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,920
not disclosed the fact that she made all

1890
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,480
of these business proposals to Anthony

1891
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,000
and that she got turned down all right

1892
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,360
around the same time as what was

1893
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,080
happening with

1894
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,639
Stephanie Ashley has not disclosed that

1895
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,480
she was still marketing and trying to

1896
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:38,080
sell Retreats using medical medium

1897
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:41,159
information to the community for over a

1898
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,520
year after Stephanie passed away and all

1899
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:46,880
the way up until literal weeks before

1900
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:50,080
she came out with her false story about

1901
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,520
Stephanie it's hard to think that Ashley

1902
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,679
is this motive driven person when she's

1903
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,199
breastfeeding or acting like she's this

1904
01:23:54,679 --> 01:24:00,800
welltoo authentic or honest Mom it's

1905
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:04,199
really a good cover like she's just a

1906
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:06,080
whistleblower to stop a mean man the

1907
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:09,159
story she's telling people never

1908
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:12,480
happened but a mom who seems so honest

1909
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:15,000
in every sense it can win somebody over

1910
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:17,280
it can win a journalist over it can win

1911
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,679
other people over especially people who

1912
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,600
are looking for reason and not like me

1913
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:25,960
her cloak in Disguise is this wholesome

1914
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,719
mother with seemingly so much wisdom who

1915
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,480
cares so deeply about the world from the

1916
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:34,520
outside raises her children with the

1917
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:37,520
best of values and then she seeks out

1918
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:40,760
journalists they see this she puts on

1919
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:43,159
this front how can she be wrong

1920
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,400
influencers who weren't friends of mine

1921
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:48,000
but were acquaintances she would

1922
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:51,320
befriend them purposely to try to sell

1923
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,639
them these stories that I'm a fraud and

1924
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:56,840
she's worked really hard at it for years

1925
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:59,400
now and in reality the truth she has a

1926
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,719
condition either born out of jealousy

1927
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:04,040
and hatred towards me or just a

1928
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:07,320
different illness where she just can't

1929
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:09,840
help but to lie and makeup stories as

1930
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:12,600
you'll learn in these episodes to come

1931
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,320
Ashley can't get anything right or

1932
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,600
anything straight not just her own

1933
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:21,239
madeup stories but factual worldly

1934
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,719
understandings that can actually be fact

1935
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:26,320
checked and she'll still be completely

1936
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,320
off the mark

1937
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,719

series as we are in the process of

1942
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,719
exposing Ashley and her organized

1943
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:44,159
hateful group for who and what they

1944
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:46,119
really are it's important to take note

1945
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:48,639
of their tactics and patterns that are

1946
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:51,080
likely to follow the plotters have a

1947
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:54,280
documented history of initiating attacks

1948
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:56,440
using lies and misinformation and then a

1949
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:59,520
on getting called out and corrected

1950
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:02,119
trying to flip it and play victim that

1951
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,719
is not going to work here all this group

1952
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:06,960
has done is spread verifiable lies and

1953
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:09,639
falsities they've carelessly attacked

1954
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,760
and harmed many innocent people they've

1955
01:26:09,639 --> 01:26:13,520
used an exploited deceased individuals

1956
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,239
and others in the process of trying to

1957
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,800
get what they want they've repeatedly

1958
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:20,679
explicitly expressed the intent to harm

1959
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,400
medical medium and they've even

1960
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:24,679
deliberately tried to stop Anthony from

1961
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,320
doing a free event to support and raise

1962
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:29,480
money for the community we have every

1963
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,920
right to set the record straight and to

1964
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,840
defend the truth with facts and evidence

1965
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,400
and to defend the chronically ill

1966
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,239
against the malicious attacks of this

1967
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:41,719
group and we are going to continue to do

1968
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:44,440
so we expect the plotters to evade and

1969
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:46,320
ignore what they have done wrong we

1970
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:49,239
expect them to continue to lie and

1971
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,239
spread falsities we expect them to Pivot

1972
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:54,719
onto something new they'll make up and

1973
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:57,600
we expect them to skew and Al altered

1974
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,880
data and to hide critical pieces of

1975
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,840
evidence that undermines their entire

1976
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:05,760
campaign we also expect the plotters to

1977
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,960
fabricate explanations as they do

1978
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,920
everything they can to try to discredit

1979
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:14,520
what we're exposing them for having done

1980
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,880
and said in their own words but we are

1981
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:20,719
using their own text messages voice

1982
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:23,440
messages social media posts words that

1983
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:25,000
they spoke on recorded calls and other

1984
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:27,880
publish material

1985
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,119
there's no use of any AI in any of these

1986
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:33,159
