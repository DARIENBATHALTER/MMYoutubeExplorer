cool cool so i got the mm 900 hds right

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
here i'm gonna do

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,360
celery that's what i'm gonna do and i'm

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
gonna show you something it's really

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
cool because everybody's totally

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,079
freaking out about the pulp

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,320
thing about how virtually i had no pulp

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,920
and it was dry to the bone and i had

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
this much celery juice

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,000
and that's because this specific model

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
there's other models that look like this

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,720
from omega but it's not this

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
model this has a device here at the end

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,280
that actually makes it so it squeezes

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
almost

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,479
every last drop out of that celery so

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,399
it's saving money like this year alone i

55
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
know i saved a ton of money half the

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,119
celery cost

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,399
easy half the celery cost so i'm not

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
throwing away my

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
my my celery juice through the pulp and

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
stuff or whatever discarding it or

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
throwing

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
throwing it in the garden or whatever

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,119
and then the juice goes with it

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,720
so what's amazing about this is this

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,599
machine is squeezing it out and i'm

66
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479

every juicer out there and

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000

it's a celery juicer which is amazing

132
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,800
but you can juice anything in it because

133
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
it's not it's a top-notch juicer

134
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,960
like like the best in my opinion

135
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,919
personal opinion the best

136
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
so it's so great so i'm running some

137
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
celery right through it now

138
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,199
i gotta show you guys like the

139
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,479
difference with the pulp like what that

140
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
is how incredible that is hello from

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,000
ontario so

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,960
cool so if anybody just got on here now

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,759
um well that's a good question dr sebby

144
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,080
said celery was bad a hybrid thoughts

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
well first of all dr sebby was still

146
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
here

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,360
because i know he passed away if he was

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
still here and he saw what happened with

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,199
the celery juice movement

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,639
and he saw millions of people healing

151
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
and he saw tens of

152
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000
thousands of healing stories people

153
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,320
getting out of wheelchairs

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
people getting their lives back acid

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,120
reflux going away

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,880
migraines going away difficult

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
menstruations going away

158
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
if he saw everything happening from

159
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,800
celery juice

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,720
i think he would change his mind because

161
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
i know he was theorizing because that's

162
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
what these guys do because there's no

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,120
there's no science that would state that

164
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,000
celery is bad

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,720
so he was theorizing that it was bad and

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
if he was alive today dr sebby

167
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
he would actually probably be bowing

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,080
down to celery juice because his

169
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,840
patients

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,199
would be coming in talking about how

171
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
it's saving their lives

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,039
like some of the other doctors out there

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,800
and stuff so that's how i kind of

174
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,199
look at it in that way plus when dr

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
sebby was here i was still here too i've

176
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,960
been doing this for 35 years

177
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
and and

178
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,360
i was already getting my people better

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,360
by the truckloads over the decades and

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
um and they were getting their lives

181
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
back from celery juice while

182
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,319
while he was telling people don't drink

183
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,600
it it's just really it just it's

184
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
unbelievable really

185
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
when you think about it so celery juice

186
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
has

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,000
shaped and changed chronic illness today

188
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
and when you think about how powerful

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,280
that is and how amazing that is it's

190
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,920
actually breathtaking like the results

191
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
so

192
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,840
[Music]

193
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
um i know you can't see it too easy

194
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
right you probably can't see it easy

195
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
i'll show you

196
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
i know someone's saying move camera down

197
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,479
i know it's difficult to get a good shot

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
today

199
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,680
so this is the i just saw a question why

200
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
do i feel like this is the best juicer

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
well

202
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,639
what it does is it's got a device on it

203
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,680
right

204
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,240
that squeezes all the juice out of

205
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
celery

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
i can't find a juicer on the market

207
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,560
that's ever done that

208
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
i've purchased them all so when i

209
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,199
purchased this

210
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
this one it was always the best juicer

211
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
company anyway but when they put the

212
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,400
device on it to make it just for celery

213
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
to get really squeeze that celery juice

214
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
out it changed everything

215
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,800
it was like okay well this is a miracle

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,919
because i'm saving a ton of money each

217
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,080
year

218
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
and that's that's a big deal celery

219
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,240
juice cured me from my debilitating

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
migraines michelle marie said

221
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,880
right i wonder what dr sebby would say

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,120
about that one

223
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,720
because he doesn't he didn't like celery

224
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
and it cured you of your debilitating

225
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
migraines

226
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
that's what i'm talking about that's

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
what i'm talking about that's

228
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,520
such a big deal that means everything

229
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
honestly that means everything

230
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,720
so you'll see pulp coming out right now

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
and this isn't just for celery you could

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
use anything in this juicer that's

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
what's incredible

234
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,550

237
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,550
[Music]

238
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,399
[Applause]

239
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
so

240
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,599
i see it my husband learned in his

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,479
toxicology class celery

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,479
is celery is full filled with nitrates

243
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,919
not correct

244
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,440
sorry it's not correct i wrote a celery

245
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
juice book

246
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,360
all about that and i talked about that

247
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
in here everything about it and where

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,279
the confusion

249
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,399
fusion lies um that's in celery

250
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:44,000
powder for preserving things

251
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,760
and it they add nitrate to it so that's

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,040
only for the preserving factories for

253
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,680
preserving food

254
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,120
they they actually take celery powder

255
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,959
and they add nitrate

256
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,399
to it to try to preserve fish

257
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,399
so that's misinformation

258
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,040
i've i've actually seen

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,440
everything about that and then some

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,880

261
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640

262
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720

look at that tiny bit for this whole

374
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
thing right here so

375
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
um i'm going to actually pour it in i

376
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
mean honestly

377
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,519
every time i do it every morning

378
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,279
you're mind blown i mean seriously just

379
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
mind blown i use a strainer you gotta

380
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,760
strain

381
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
even though you just juiced it you

382
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,240
should still strain it

383
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,360
should still strain it that that's the

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,360
best way to do it there

385
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,600
it's still the best way to do glad it

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
guys are with me today i'm excited about

387
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,160
this so that's it

388
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
there okay

389
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
look at that okay incredible and i got

390
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
this dried out

391
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
little tiny bit of rope right here now

392
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,760
the difference is with that

393
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,199
is it can save me like

394
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,560
it's in the thousands at the end of the

395
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:59,680
year i buy so many cases of celery

396
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,600
and it cut the cost in half

397
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
just boom this juicer paid for itself

398
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
over and over

399
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
and over and over again and guess what

400
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,240
this isn't a 700 juicer

401
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
this isn't a thousand dollar juicer this

402
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,120
isn't like

403
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,839
a 1500 juicer or a 600 juicer

404
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
it's on sale it's 200 and something

405
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
dollars

406
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,680
it's it's it's black friday on top of it

407
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
it just doesn't

408
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,440
it just doesn't get any better than that

409
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,639

yeah it has

442
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
natural sodium cluster salts a subgroup

443
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
of sodium

444
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,759
that's your medicine that's different

445
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,240
than salt

446
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,279

447
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839

448
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,519

people's skin issues are just terrible

451
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
terrible

452
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,480
[Music]

453
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
so celery juice is one of these things

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
that

455
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
has benefits beyond what research and

456
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
science knows first of all they didn't

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,480
know it had any benefits

458
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,720
medical medium information put out

459
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
information on celery juice okay there

460
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
was no information on celery juice

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,800
that existed okay it was all medical

462
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,240
medium information

463
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
and now people are toting it out there

464
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
everywhere they're saying it does this

465
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
that does that it does this they don't

466
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
cite back to medical medium but they'll

467
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,279
say it does this this this

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
lower blood pressure do this all the

469
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,800
stuff and they don't cite anything back

470
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
to medical medium they act like

471
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
there's been real research and studies

472
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,480
on it there isn't

473
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,759
there hasn't there hasn't been any

474
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
research

475
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
and studies on celery juice but guess

476
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,440
what

477
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,320
millions are healing and reversing

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
disease and symptoms and conditions so

479
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,519
let's talk about benefits a little bit

480
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
that's exciting right there so i got my

481
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120

482
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,000
and if you guys just got on here

483
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120

um because

486
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,600
i just juiced over 32 ounces of celery

487
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,240
juice okay

488
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,040
that's what i did and in this container

489
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
it's it's a joke how much how how little

490
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,320
is in here

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
in this container right here there's

492
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,319
this little bit in the corner

493
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,760
look and

494
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,280
it's dry to the bone that's it

495
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,799
um i washed all this celery and i don't

496
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
need to juice it

497
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,799
i'm going to juice it later because i'm

498
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
still going to do some lives

499
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,120
but is unbelievable so it's just great

500
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,319
it's great so i want to talk about

501
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,439
benefits of celery

502
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,160
i'm going to grab a celery stick right

503
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319

505
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,760
celery stick

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
so everybody's been asking me to twirl

507
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,200
the celery sticks

508
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,720
like in the celery just video on tick

509
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
tock i'm just saying they've always been

510
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
there everybody's asking me can you do

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
it again can you

512
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
control it can you twirl it it's pretty

513
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,000
funny but um anyway

514
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,679
so the benefits of celery let's just

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
talk about about it a little bit there's

516
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,799
a vitamin c

517
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,360
in celery okay a vitamin c and

518
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,600
you can eat the celery sticks but you

519
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,559
don't get enough of all its medicine

520
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,320
it's vitamin c it's sodium cluster salts

521
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,760
and i'll talk about what these things do

522
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,960
okay um it's phytochemical compounds

523
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,480
right it it doesn't you can't get enough

524
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
if you eat the sticks

525
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
so somebody like well i'm just gonna eat

526
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,160
the sticks and be fine with that

527
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
no it's not gonna happen that way you're

528
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
not if

529
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
you if you chop up a little bit of this

530
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,120
and put it in your tuna salad you're not

531
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
going to get anywhere with it if you

532
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,400
have this crudite with this

533
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,919
and you're dipping it in some some ranch

534
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,679
dressing whatever it is

535
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,760
you're not going to get you're not going

536
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,000
to get the benefits if you eat it or

537
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,600
chop it up in your salad you're still

538
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,200
not gonna get the benefits you have to

539
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,600
juice it that's the key you can use and

540
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,120
you can use whatever juicer you have

541
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
you can use whatever juicer you have if

542
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,039
you guys got a juicer use it

543
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
okay i'm just showing you a place you

544
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
can go down the road

545
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
with a juicer that can change your life

546
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,679
for money-wise it can save you

547
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
so much money all of that and and plus

548
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,240
it's just

549
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,600
it's cold it's a cold pressed juicer

550
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
it's a cold pressed juicer which is

551
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,640
amazing on top of it

552
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,720
so it just it doesn't butcher the celery

553
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
it doesn't butcher it and heat it up and

554
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
butcher it so that's another thing too

555
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
but anyway go back to the benefits a

556
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,880
little bit all right

557
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,480
so there's a vitamin c in celery

558
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,799
that does not have to be converted

559
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,960
vitamin c has to be converted by your

560
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,600
liver in order to make it work

561
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
in order for it to actually work it has

562
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,919
to be converted

563
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,559
in celery it doesn't have to be that

564
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
means

565
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,640
that that vitamin c boom goes straight

566
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,039
to your immune system

567
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,000
instantly it doesn't go around the bend

568
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,799
to finally try to get there it doesn't

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
have to go

570
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
to the middle man which is your liver

571
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,280
see

572
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,240
vitamin c has to go

573
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
to your liver any vitamin c in food so

574
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
any vitamin c

575
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
if you've been taught eat this food

576
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,480
because it's got vitamin c

577
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,600
it has to go to the liver first

578
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
get converted and then it can go to your

579
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,360
immune system

580
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,559
well here's the difference right here

581
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,559
right here and you know what you know

582
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,799

science

609
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,360
kills off bugs so it starts to kill off

610
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
pathogens

medicine

620
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,039
goes to the bugs and starts to weaken

621
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,480
them

622
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400

puts all this builds up all the sebum

628
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,799
oil to try to stop the strep and then it

629
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,120
becomes nothing but a mess

630
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,200

631
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,480
empty stomach

659
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480

745
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
thyroid medications go into the liver

746
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,360
and it gets stagnant

747
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,480
sluggish and then in that liver is also

748
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,240
little buggies

749
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
the epstein bar that's a big one that

750
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,520
sits inside the liver

751
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,159
so if you have toxic heavy metals in

752
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,080
there too copper lead arsenic aluminum

753
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,840
mercury cadmium nickel inside your liver

754
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,679
that copper and other metals feed

755
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,400
viruses then a dermatoxin is produced

756
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,919
and an aluminum-based one for vitiligo

757
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,760
and you lose your melon and you lose the

758
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,960
pigment that's how it works celery juice

759
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,440
goes into the liver

760
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,360
and it starts to do some healing plus

761
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,240
it's got phytochemical compounds that

762
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,760
help heal the skin and i talk about that

763
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,840
in celery juice book which is really

764
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
cool

765
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,279
um so yeah

766
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,799

causes the fibromyalgia hashimoto's

772
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,400
thyroiditis r.a

773
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,840
lyme disease it causes a lot of trouble

774
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,320
in a lot of people there's different

775
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,919
varieties there's over 60 varieties

776
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,039
of epstein-barr and research and science

777
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,640
doesn't even know that they thought

778
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,279
epstein-barr just did this you know what

779
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,960
they thought

780
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
barr did all these years they thought it

781
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,480
just made somebody tired

782
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
and gave them a mild fever when they had

783
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320
mono that's it that's all they knew

784
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,080
medical media information and books

785
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,039
published that epstein-barr causes all

786
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,320
these conditions

787
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,840
and guess what a few years later after

788
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,360
millions of books went into doctor's

789
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,320
offices uh

790
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,120
a few years later they decided to say uh

791
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,880
they think

792
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,279
now epstein barr is linked to

793
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
hashimoto's they think it's linked now

794
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,080
to r.a

795
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,679
they think it's linked now to

796
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,039
neurological lime

797
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,039
for medical medium information it's

798
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,840
pretty pretty amazing really what's

799
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,240
happened

800
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
and it's really great it's really great

801
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,760
um can we give

802
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,320
the wildlife celery juice

803
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
because of chemtrails is that i think

804
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,720
that's what you're saying the

805
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,360
wildlife i don't know i mean you can

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,200
look i i got squirrels i put out little

807
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,200
pieces of celery and squirrels eaten

808
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,399
out there for squirrels um and i think

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,440
the question i think was confused by the

810
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,720
question or the con

811
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,919
the question probably a little different

812
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,600
than what it looks like um

813
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
yeah ingrid you could use limes instead

814
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
of lemon i just saw that

815
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,480
in your lemon water you can have lime

816
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
water if you really need to that's okay

817
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,559
too

818
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,520
you can do that so yeah

819
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,840
so you guys the thing is here is that

820
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,080
when it comes down to celery juice

821
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,880
you're helping your body heal and that's

822
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360
a big deal

823
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,039
and if you're somebody that's not sick

824
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,600
and you're not worried about healing

825
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,200
it's still good because it can actually

826
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,720
prevent things and that's what i love

827
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
