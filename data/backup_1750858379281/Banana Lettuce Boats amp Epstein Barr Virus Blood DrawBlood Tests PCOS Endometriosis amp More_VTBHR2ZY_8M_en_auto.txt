[25.84 - 29.28] we're making
[26.72 - 30.48] banana lettuce boats we're talking about
[29.28 - 33.04] epstein barr
[30.48 - 34.24] we're talking about blood draw why blood
[33.04 - 38.24] draws
[34.24 - 40.16] have like a connection to epstein barr
[38.24 - 41.92] how's that possible getting your blood
[40.16 - 43.60] drawn getting the blood test at the
[41.92 - 44.32] doctor you think you're doing a good
[43.60 - 46.16] thing
[44.32 - 47.84] they take too much blood they remove
[46.16 - 49.36] your immune system and then epstein-barr
[47.84 - 51.44] creeps up i'm gonna read about
[49.36 - 52.24] epstein-barr in this book michelle l
[51.44 - 54.64] you're here
[52.24 - 56.80] hey honored to have you here on this
[54.64 - 59.04] saturday okay limb bomb love
[56.80 - 60.40] you're here too what okay so we're gonna
[59.04 - 64.00] be just doing some
[60.40 - 67.52] work on that um this is an important
[64.00 - 69.60] important live right now because
[67.52 - 71.44] i never really clarified what's
[69.60 - 74.24] happening with epstein barr
[71.44 - 76.24] everybody has it it leads to just all
[74.24 - 77.04] kinds of problems it leads to weight
[76.24 - 79.28] gain
[77.04 - 80.96] weight gain you've got millions of
[79.28 - 82.80] people on the planet
[80.96 - 84.64] millions and millions of people right
[82.80 - 86.32] having weight issues
[84.64 - 88.40] and they're having these weight issues
[86.32 - 91.44] because they got the low
[88.40 - 94.56] grade epstein bar year after year
[91.44 - 98.84] living inside the liver churning and
[94.56 - 101.60] turning and producing by product
[98.84 - 103.52] by-product so important to know
[101.60 - 105.76] and that's what happens the epstein-barr
[103.52 - 106.72] creates all this byproduct inside the
[105.76 - 109.04] liver
[106.72 - 110.64] and then we get in trouble because all
[109.04 - 111.60] of a sudden the liver gets stagnant and
[110.64 - 112.88] sluggish
[111.60 - 115.12] stagnant sluggish glad you guys are

[302.40 - 306.00] how intense that is as far as relating
[304.88 - 309.28] to it
[306.00 - 311.92] um yeah the epstein-barr lorraine
[309.28 - 313.36] sleeping giant it really is it's a

[313.92 - 321.52] hot flashes heart palpitations
[318.32 - 324.40] epstein-barr heart palpitations
[321.52 - 326.16] hot flashes epstein barr really
[324.40 - 329.04] important now
[326.16 - 329.44] okay so let's get into it a little bit
[329.04 - 331.28] so
[329.44 - 332.76] i'm in the epstein-barr virus chronic
[331.28 - 335.68] fatigue syndrome and
[332.76 - 337.20] fibromyalgia right read a little bit of
[335.68 - 339.52] that you guys ready the epstein-barr
[337.20 - 343.20] virus has created a secret
[339.52 - 348.08] epidemic that's the epidemic
[343.20 - 351.04] that's what it is it's the epstein barr
[348.08 - 352.24] and that's the secret epidemic and
[351.04 - 354.80] people don't just
[352.24 - 355.44] have one epstein bar inside of them they
[354.80 - 358.48] got two
[355.44 - 361.84] epstein bars in them mutations
[358.48 - 363.76] variations different ones they can have
[361.84 - 366.96] more than two epstein bars
[363.76 - 369.76] they can have three epstein bars
[366.96 - 370.72] right it can have three some people can
[369.76 - 373.84] have three not
[370.72 - 376.32] three of the same one three
[373.84 - 377.44] i don't know how to juggle but i'm just
[376.32 - 379.68] saying
[377.44 - 382.24] three epstein bars people can have up to
[379.68 - 385.20] three some people can have more
[382.24 - 386.80] four they can have five and and that's
[385.20 - 387.52] how it works with epsilon bar you can
[386.80 - 389.92] pick them up
[387.52 - 392.32] through your lifetime talk about that a
[389.92 - 395.28] little bit everybody's got it and hey
[392.32 - 397.12] like i said you're thinking i don't got
[395.28 - 398.80] the epstein-barr virus my doctor says
[397.12 - 400.08] i'm clear i got nothing going on what
[398.80 - 401.44] symptoms do you have a little bit of
[400.08 - 405.20] weight gain
[401.44 - 408.24] some palpitations maybe a little ectopic
[405.20 - 410.16] heartbeat got a little hypothyroidism am
[408.24 - 412.08] i ringing any bells here
[410.16 - 414.96] any kind of dizziness dizziness in your
[412.08 - 418.16] life at one point any kind of vertigo
[414.96 - 420.24] any kind of body pain unexplainable your
[418.16 - 422.32] knees bother you a little bit but really
[420.24 - 425.60] there's no real good reason
[422.32 - 429.16] how about that okay and pcos
[425.60 - 432.08] like i said and endometriosis
[429.16 - 434.40] infertility epstein-barr
[432.08 - 435.20] mystery infertility not like you don't
[434.40 - 437.60] have a clog
[435.20 - 439.60] fallopian tube like mystery so that's
[437.60 - 442.96] important to know okay
[439.60 - 445.44] so keep that in mind um
[442.96 - 447.76] let's go a little bit with this so we're
[445.44 - 450.08] at a place in time where the majority of
[447.76 - 452.80] the world's population is living
[450.08 - 454.72] with one or more of many mutations of
[452.80 - 456.96] the epstein-barr virus
[454.72 - 458.88] epstein-barr is responsible for symptoms
[456.96 - 461.04] conditions diseases
[458.88 - 462.08] disorders and illnesses of every
[461.04 - 463.84] category
[462.08 - 465.44] for some people it creates fatigue and
[463.84 - 468.80] pain that get targeted
[465.44 - 471.60] tagged as lyme disease or go unnamed
[468.80 - 473.36] for others epstein-barr symptoms prompts
[471.60 - 475.44] doctors to prescribe ineffective
[473.36 - 477.36] treatments such as hormone replacement
[475.44 - 478.48] a lot of times that i've seen bar you
[477.36 - 479.52] know everybody's told it's their
[478.48 - 482.00] hormones
[479.52 - 483.60] it's their hormones right no that's
[482.00 - 485.92] those symptoms are your hormones
[483.60 - 487.60] that fatigue that's your hormones those
[485.92 - 487.92] aches and pains that's your hormones
[487.60 - 489.84] right
[487.92 - 491.20] those migraines that's your hormones
[489.84 - 494.96] like but we got the
[491.20 - 496.72] bar instead that's how it works um
[494.96 - 499.20] so a lot of people are walking around
[496.72 - 501.36] with ebv and they get misdiagnosed
[499.20 - 503.92] are you one of them among the reasons
[501.36 - 505.28] ebv is thriving so little is understood
[503.92 - 507.04] about it
[505.28 - 508.48] actually the only thing understood about
[507.04 - 509.84] epstein-barr out there in research in
[508.48 - 513.28] science was taken from
[509.84 - 515.68] medical medium book one
[513.28 - 517.44] that's right before medical medium book
[515.68 - 520.80] one epstein-barr was just
[517.44 - 523.68] mono and mono went away you get mono
[520.80 - 524.16] you're sick it went away that's it so if
[523.68 - 526.16] you're
[524.16 - 528.08] a patient and you're sitting here you
[526.16 - 531.84] get a call from the doctor's office
[528.08 - 536.00] you're like hello oh hi
[531.84 - 539.12] i got mononucleosis that's what i have
[536.00 - 541.28] that's why i got the swollen glands and
[539.12 - 543.84] i can't swallow good
[541.28 - 546.56] and that's why i had the fever and the
[543.84 - 550.24] listlessness and malaise
[546.56 - 553.68] so i got mono how do you like that
[550.24 - 555.12] what after it goes away i'll never see
[553.68 - 557.28] it again
[555.12 - 559.12] no problems either and never a symptom
[557.28 - 560.56] ever in my life
[559.12 - 562.24] okay well that's what research in
[560.56 - 564.08] science says now right and that's what
[562.24 - 565.76] you say there at the doctor's office i'm
[564.08 - 568.32] never going to see a symptom
[565.76 - 570.32] mono is just mono is that the
[568.32 - 573.52] epstein-barr virus
[570.32 - 575.52] it is and all it does is give you mono
[573.52 - 576.88] okay and then the publication of the
[575.52 - 578.64] medical medium book
[576.88 - 580.40] has determined epstein-barr to be the
[578.64 - 582.16] culprit of a whole bunch of diseases
[580.40 - 584.72] symptoms conditions and research and
[582.16 - 587.84] science plagiarized
[584.72 - 590.00] and you know what you know it's uncool
[587.84 - 593.52] because they have to legally
[590.00 - 595.12] cite where it comes from and because of
[593.52 - 596.24] discrimination because of my source they
[595.12 - 598.72] feel like they don't have to but that's
[596.24 - 600.96] not true they actually have to cite it
[598.72 - 603.76] and so that's important to know for the
[600.96 - 608.00] future by the way
[603.76 - 610.08] um let's talk about this so anyway
[608.00 - 611.20] among the reasons it's thriving because
[610.08 - 613.68] very little is
[611.20 - 615.12] understood medical research and science
[613.68 - 618.00] are only aware of
[615.12 - 618.48] one version of epstein-barr okay get
[618.00 - 621.92] this
[618.48 - 625.20] right one version of epstein barr
[621.92 - 627.20] and then medical medium is over 60
[625.20 - 630.48] varieties of epstein-barr
[627.20 - 632.00] okay now there's a little
[630.48 - 633.68] little thing going on with research and
[632.00 - 638.80] science where they think there might be
[633.68 - 641.52] two stealing information once again
[638.80 - 643.76] theresa i'm one week into drinking heavy
[641.52 - 645.12] metal detox smoothie daily and switch to
[643.76 - 648.40] vimergy b12
[645.12 - 650.56] wow what an improvement um
[648.40 - 651.76] it's important for anybody who needs to
[650.56 - 655.36] know this stuff i've been saying this
[651.76 - 658.72] for a long time b12 is not b12
[655.36 - 662.08] b12 is not b12 it's not okay
[658.72 - 663.92] there's b12 and then there's b12
[662.08 - 666.08] and there's a big difference it's make
[663.92 - 667.92] or break to how to heal
[666.08 - 669.68] um from what i've experienced with
[667.92 - 671.92] friends and family
[669.68 - 673.36] is there's a massive difference with the
[671.92 - 675.04] vimergy b12
[673.36 - 676.96] massive difference so if anybody wants
[675.04 - 681.04] to know that's v's and victor i
[676.96 - 684.00] am as mary e rgy.com i'm not sponsored
[681.04 - 684.88] but here's the deal the deal is i want
[684.00 - 686.96] people better
[684.88 - 688.00] and i like people getting better and i
[686.96 - 689.92] care about people getting
[688.00 - 691.52] better and i notice that with friends
[689.92 - 693.52] and families and
[691.52 - 695.44] and you know that i've known personally
[693.52 - 697.36] in my life and i say no no no that's not
[695.44 - 699.04] the right b12 switch it to b12 and all
[697.36 - 700.64] of a sudden they're moving forward it
[699.04 - 702.48] makes a big difference
[700.64 - 704.16] these are tools though these are tools
[702.48 - 706.00] that's what it's about
[704.16 - 708.32] april says what book is this the new
[706.00 - 710.80] edition april so it's medical medium new
[708.32 - 713.84] edition revised and expanded
[710.80 - 715.12] new edition okay link is in the
[713.84 - 717.76] description
[715.12 - 719.28] just so you know there's over 60
[717.76 - 721.76] varieties and growing
[719.28 - 723.04] they're mutating i saw lunell she's on
[721.76 - 725.44] today i saw you chodes
[723.04 - 727.52] she's on today they're mutating 60
[725.44 - 729.04] varieties of epstein barr
[727.52 - 730.56] you guys just came out of making banana
[729.04 - 731.76] lettuce boats
[730.56 - 734.00] but we're just talking about a little
[731.76 - 735.76] epstein-barr for the moment
[734.00 - 738.48] epstein-barr is behind several of the
[735.76 - 742.88] debilitating illnesses that stump
[738.48 - 744.72] doctors that stump doctors
[742.88 - 746.08] as i said in the introduction it's the
[744.72 - 749.28] mystery illness of
[746.08 - 751.36] mystery illnesses it's what epstein-barr
[749.28 - 753.04] is still is today even though they've
[751.36 - 753.68] taken medical medium information and now
[753.04 - 755.12] they
[753.68 - 756.72] test for epstein-barr every time they
[755.12 - 758.96] test for lyme disease
[756.72 - 759.92] i had my lyme disease test and i got my
[758.96 - 761.60] epstein-barr test
[759.92 - 763.84] this phone's getting out of control now
[761.60 - 766.80] okay what
[763.84 - 768.56] i thought you tested me for lyme disease
[766.80 - 770.16] you tested me for epstein-barr at the
[768.56 - 771.52] same time as you tested me for lyme
[770.16 - 773.76] disease
[771.52 - 774.88] how come i thought i was looking for
[773.76 - 777.28] like a lime
[774.88 - 778.48] test because i thought i had lyme
[777.28 - 781.44] disease
[778.48 - 783.04] but you tested for epstein-barr too why
[781.44 - 784.80] would you do that
[783.04 - 786.32] because of anthony william and that's
[784.80 - 788.32] what happens now
[786.32 - 791.12] the world's changing they're testing for
[788.32 - 791.12] epstein-barr
[791.68 - 795.52] and then let's go a little bit more here
[793.44 - 796.08] into it medical research and science
[795.52 - 799.44] have no
[796.08 - 801.92] idea how the virus operates long-term
[799.44 - 803.84] they just thought it gave you mono
[801.92 - 806.48] that's all they thought
[803.84 - 808.32] yeah they didn't know how problematic it
[806.48 - 810.00] could be the truth is epstein-barr
[808.32 - 811.76] is the source of numerous health
[810.00 - 814.64] problems i just talked about that
[811.76 - 817.44] fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome
[814.64 - 820.16] ebv is also the cause of some major
[817.44 - 821.84] maladies that medical communities think
[820.16 - 824.96] they understand but really
[821.84 - 827.92] don't including thyroid disease lupus
[824.96 - 829.52] vertigo tinnitus so that's what we're
[827.92 - 831.12] doing we're talking about epstein-barr
[829.52 - 833.92] right here
[831.12 - 835.28] so um you guys it's so great i'm gonna
[833.92 - 836.48] make banana lettuce boats in a little
[835.28 - 840.16] bit
[836.48 - 840.16] so take it from there
[840.84 - 846.56] um we're in epstein bar right now
[844.32 - 849.04] talking about the different sections in
[846.56 - 849.04] here too
[849.20 - 859.04] all right
[856.16 - 861.44] would i've seen bar be responsible for
[859.04 - 862.72] swollen lymph nodes bumps on one side of
[861.44 - 864.80] the neck
[862.72 - 866.64] and i've taught this to doctors for
[864.80 - 867.68] years okay that's what epstein-barr does
[866.64 - 869.52] it swells up
[867.68 - 872.00] lymph nodes that's a big thing
[869.52 - 875.12] epstein-barr does so it's a lymph node
[872.00 - 877.84] sweller for sure and that's that's how
[875.12 - 879.60] ebb works
[877.84 - 881.68] until the publication is booked those
[879.60 - 883.52] with ebv would typically be stuck with
[881.68 - 885.76] it for the rest of their lives doctors
[883.52 - 887.68] are starting to accept and learn from
[885.76 - 888.48] the information released here that have
[887.68 - 891.68] seen bar
[888.48 - 893.36] is the root cause of problems in the
[891.68 - 895.20] past they believe the most trouble
[893.36 - 898.72] epstein-barr caused for a patient was
[895.20 - 902.08] mild fatigue and malaise that's it
[898.72 - 903.12] that's it possible fever now some
[902.08 - 905.28] doctors are in the
[903.12 - 907.44] infancy stage of recognizing and
[905.28 - 908.40] addressing the epstein-barr virus due to
[907.44 - 910.64] the medical meaning
[908.40 - 912.00] information public published so it's
[910.64 - 913.36] very interesting there okay
[912.00 - 915.44] so let's talk about the different stages
[913.36 - 918.32] i want to give you guys a rundown
[915.44 - 919.60] first stage epson bar is you contract it
[918.32 - 922.72] you're in a restaurant
[919.60 - 925.44] okay so you're in a restaurant
[922.72 - 927.36] well i just got a nice piece of bread
[925.44 - 930.64] here with butter on it
[927.36 - 931.60] in the restaurant here and i didn't know
[930.64 - 933.52] the chef
[931.60 - 934.64] a little spittle came out of the chef's
[933.52 - 936.40] mouth right
[934.64 - 937.76] he was yelling at the other chef the
[936.40 - 939.68] sous chef
[937.76 - 941.20] and he was making the but he was getting
[939.68 - 941.68] the butter and he was making the bread
[941.20 - 943.68] and
[941.68 - 945.52] no one knew that he was yelling at the
[943.68 - 946.96] guy next to him and spit was flying out
[945.52 - 947.52] of his mouth while he was back there in
[946.96 - 949.52] the kitchen
[947.52 - 952.56] and that spit landed on that bread and
[949.52 - 957.20] butter and i ate that bread and butter
[952.56 - 959.44] and now i just contracted epstein-barr
[957.20 - 961.68] that's as easy as it gets like it's
[959.44 - 964.48] simple and quick and easy like that
[961.68 - 966.84] you can catch it like that so easy and
[964.48 - 969.92] that's how it works
[966.84 - 973.12] um kissing
[969.92 - 974.40] it's another one duh right relationships
[973.12 - 976.08] it's another one
[974.40 - 978.48] public bathrooms it's another one
[976.08 - 981.52] sipping off of people's water
[978.48 - 983.20] yeah i'll take that i'll you just had a
[981.52 - 983.60] sip i'll take a step too you just had a
[983.20 - 985.92] sip
[983.60 - 986.80] i'll take a sip too so it's like that
[985.92 - 989.68] right double
[986.80 - 990.56] dipping so i'm just gonna stick my
[989.68 - 994.00] cheese
[990.56 - 997.04] my cheese stick in this sauce right here
[994.00 - 997.76] i'm at a party i'm gonna take a bite put
[997.04 - 1001.36] it back in
[997.76 - 1003.28] double dip boom epstein bar
[1001.36 - 1004.88] it's how it's done it's how it always
[1003.28 - 1006.72] was done
[1004.88 - 1008.16] and epstein bar goes through stages
[1006.72 - 1010.16] that's the first stage now you got it
[1008.16 - 1012.24] floating around in your body
[1010.16 - 1013.52] it's floating around floating around
[1012.24 - 1017.04] it's floating around
[1013.52 - 1019.20] okay and eventually
[1017.04 - 1020.24] it's only floating around a little bit
[1019.20 - 1022.16] okay
[1020.24 - 1023.44] it could be anywhere in the body
[1022.16 - 1026.08] floating around
[1023.44 - 1027.20] in the bloodstream but not a lot of it
[1026.08 - 1030.16] not a lot of it
[1027.20 - 1031.44] not a lot of it at all okay but it's
[1030.16 - 1035.20] floating around
[1031.44 - 1036.72] and then it eats something it likes so
[1035.20 - 1038.56] it's in your bloodstream and it has
[1036.72 - 1039.84] something it likes to eat so let's go
[1038.56 - 1042.48] into a few things
[1039.84 - 1044.00] it likes to eat something so now it's
[1042.48 - 1046.88] eating
[1044.00 - 1047.92] an egg so you eat your eggs you like
[1046.88 - 1049.76] your eggs
[1047.92 - 1052.24] i like this hard-boiled egg you know i
[1049.76 - 1053.12] like to or i like this one minute boiled
[1052.24 - 1055.20] egg right
[1053.12 - 1057.04] you eat your egg you enjoy it fried eggs
[1055.20 - 1059.84] whatever scrambled eggs
[1057.04 - 1061.52] and then when you eat the food the virus
[1059.84 - 1063.20] eats the food
[1061.52 - 1065.68] that's finding its way into your
[1063.20 - 1068.80] bloodstream that's how it works
[1065.68 - 1072.00] the virus then all of a sudden does this
[1068.80 - 1073.60] okay does this and all of a sudden the
[1072.00 - 1076.16] virus goes like that
[1073.60 - 1076.16] there's two
[1076.80 - 1084.00] right three
[1080.00 - 1087.04] and now four then five
[1084.00 - 1088.48] then six now you got a bunch of these
[1087.04 - 1091.60] swimming around in your body
[1088.48 - 1095.04] now your immune system
[1091.60 - 1096.96] gets wise and
[1095.04 - 1098.16] so your immune system is just doing its
[1096.96 - 1099.52] thing floating around in your
[1098.16 - 1102.88] bloodstream
[1099.52 - 1106.32] and then it comes across one of them
[1102.88 - 1106.32] and then the war pursues
[1106.96 - 1112.08] and that's coming in to stage two
[1110.32 - 1115.20] so that's how the process works i want
[1112.08 - 1115.20] to talk about that in a minute
[1116.16 - 1119.76] so stage one is it's just floating
[1118.00 - 1123.04] around your system
[1119.76 - 1125.04] you contracted it it's there's going to
[1123.04 - 1126.64] be time and it waits for your immune
[1125.04 - 1128.72] system to drop too
[1126.64 - 1129.68] so it waits for your immune system to
[1128.72 - 1132.72] drop as
[1129.68 - 1134.64] it's producing so it's getting stronger
[1132.72 - 1137.12] by eating eggs
[1134.64 - 1138.40] it's getting stronger by eating cheese
[1137.12 - 1141.12] that's what it's doing
[1138.40 - 1142.48] it's in our body it's eating food okay
[1141.12 - 1146.00] that's stage one
[1142.48 - 1148.24] and then stage two is the war
[1146.00 - 1149.20] and that's stage two that's stage two is
[1148.24 - 1151.76] the war against
[1149.20 - 1153.68] the epstein bar and your immune system
[1151.76 - 1154.80] but the immune system usually weakens
[1153.68 - 1156.88] before
[1154.80 - 1159.12] it makes its break and that's how it
[1156.88 - 1159.76] works too so you get stressed out maybe
[1159.12 - 1162.08] betrayal
[1159.76 - 1164.16] broken trust maybe you're totally just
[1162.08 - 1166.40] your adrenals are compromised
[1164.16 - 1167.92] because you're so jacked up on caffeine
[1166.40 - 1168.40] your immune system lowers because of
[1167.92 - 1170.24] that
[1168.40 - 1172.08] other problems too clones perfumes
[1170.24 - 1173.68] concentric candles air fresheners lower
[1172.08 - 1175.44] your immune system
[1173.68 - 1178.08] but why does it affect some and not
[1175.44 - 1179.84] others depends what you got going on
[1178.08 - 1181.52] how many toxic heavy metals do you have
[1179.84 - 1183.36] in your system how much stress are you
[1181.52 - 1183.84] under are you under financial stress are
[1183.36 - 1186.40] you
[1183.84 - 1188.72] did you go through a divorce everybody
[1186.40 - 1191.68] has these different immune system
[1188.72 - 1192.00] busting complications are you eating
[1191.68 - 1194.88] more
[1192.00 - 1196.64] eggs than somebody else what variety of
[1194.88 - 1199.36] epstein-barr did you contract
[1196.64 - 1201.20] there's over 60 varieties and growing so
[1199.36 - 1203.12] which variety of epson bar did you
[1201.20 - 1204.96] contract that right there is a big one
[1203.12 - 1207.04] too is it a more aggressive one
[1204.96 - 1208.80] like the ones going around now which are
[1207.04 - 1211.44] much much more aggressive
[1208.80 - 1214.08] or is it one of the old-school varieties
[1211.44 - 1215.92] they sit in the body for a long time
[1214.08 - 1217.60] and you don't hear from them until
[1215.92 - 1219.44] you're 49 years old
[1217.60 - 1221.60] and then now you got the weight gain and
[1219.44 - 1222.88] the fatigue i've been eating whatever i
[1221.60 - 1225.04] want my whole life
[1222.88 - 1226.88] i've been skinny my whole life my
[1225.04 - 1228.88] friends they they're always jealous
[1226.88 - 1230.88] because i've been thin my whole life and
[1228.88 - 1232.72] then all of a sudden you're 49 years old
[1230.88 - 1234.96] it's like why is this weight coming on
[1232.72 - 1236.64] why am i getting heart palpitations why
[1234.96 - 1238.56] am i getting hot flashes
[1236.64 - 1240.00] you might have the old school kind and
[1238.56 - 1241.44] now you go to the doctor and they're
[1240.00 - 1244.00] saying you're hypothyroid
[1241.44 - 1245.84] it's the old school one so what happens
[1244.00 - 1250.24] is it's different for each person
[1245.84 - 1252.88] stage two is the war and the war is
[1250.24 - 1254.56] your immune system with the epstein barr
[1252.88 - 1257.92] so that's stage two
[1254.56 - 1257.92] so we'll go into that a little bit
[1258.80 - 1262.56] at the end of stage one the epstein-barr
[1260.56 - 1265.92] virus becomes willing to
[1262.56 - 1267.60] challenge your immune system in battle
[1265.92 - 1269.60] that's when epstein-barr first makes its
[1267.60 - 1271.44] presence known by turning into what
[1269.60 - 1272.16] doctors call mononucleosis that's the
[1271.44 - 1273.92] war
[1272.16 - 1276.00] that's when it's now mono you might not
[1273.92 - 1278.32] feel your motto you might not feel
[1276.00 - 1279.20] it it might not even be an aggressive
[1278.32 - 1281.36] variety
[1279.20 - 1282.48] you might not have a lot of stressors in
[1281.36 - 1284.56] your life
[1282.48 - 1286.56] and somebody else they got more of an
[1284.56 - 1288.72] aggressive strain of fc bar and that
[1286.56 - 1290.88] mono hits them really hard
[1288.72 - 1293.28] really really hard so that's important
[1290.88 - 1296.88] there too to know
[1293.28 - 1299.04] so and then what happens when that war
[1296.88 - 1301.44] happens and you get the mononucleosis
[1299.04 - 1303.12] your immune system eventually starts to
[1301.44 - 1305.04] win the war and that's when your immune
[1303.12 - 1306.64] system starts to beat out that epstein
[1305.04 - 1307.52] bar and winning the war and winning the
[1306.64 - 1309.76] war
[1307.52 - 1311.28] then what's left of that epstein bar
[1309.76 - 1314.48] because it knows
[1311.28 - 1317.52] it's been defeated it makes a run for
[1314.48 - 1319.20] your organs and it ends up making a run
[1317.52 - 1322.32] for the liver
[1319.20 - 1324.48] spleen and reproductive system
[1322.32 - 1325.92] okay a lot of times it might be the
[1324.48 - 1327.28] liver
[1325.92 - 1329.12] some women it might be the liver and
[1327.28 - 1330.00] reproductive system and then it goes in
[1329.12 - 1332.88] there and it goes
[1330.00 - 1333.92] dormant your doctor says your motto is
[1332.88 - 1336.56] over
[1333.92 - 1337.36] and now you're free you're free to live
[1336.56 - 1339.92] your life
[1337.36 - 1341.04] your motto is gone nothing to worry
[1339.92 - 1346.08] about it
[1341.04 - 1348.80] and that is how it goes so
[1346.08 - 1350.56] go into this a little bit it's during
[1348.80 - 1353.04] this stage the epstein-barr seeks a
[1350.56 - 1354.40] long-term home by making a run for one
[1353.04 - 1356.96] or more of your major
[1354.40 - 1358.16] organs typically your liver spleen
[1356.96 - 1361.52] reproductive system
[1358.16 - 1362.88] organs ebv loves being in these organs
[1361.52 - 1366.08] because of mercury
[1362.88 - 1368.32] dioxins other toxins residues from foods
[1366.08 - 1370.24] such as eggs dairy products and gluten
[1368.32 - 1373.20] are likely to accumulate here
[1370.24 - 1375.28] the virus thrives on these poisons which
[1373.20 - 1377.44] could eventually lead to endometriosis
[1375.28 - 1378.16] fibroids pcos ovarian cysts prostate
[1377.44 - 1381.12] issues
[1378.16 - 1381.76] mystery infertility so that's how it
[1381.12 - 1385.04] works
[1381.76 - 1386.24] um so now the epstein bar is just
[1385.04 - 1389.44] camping out
[1386.24 - 1391.36] and so it's camping out so then we go
[1389.44 - 1394.96] into the next stage
[1391.36 - 1398.80] right your immune system drops again
[1394.96 - 1400.24] it drops how does it drop
[1398.80 - 1402.32] and it could have dropped even from this
[1400.24 - 1404.96] before the blood draw
[1402.32 - 1405.36] that's how it drops that's a big one
[1404.96 - 1408.64] that
[1405.36 - 1411.44] leads to more problems i mean this
[1408.64 - 1413.44] blood draw okay will drop it at any time
[1411.44 - 1414.00] it'll drop it at any time during your
[1413.44 - 1416.56] stage
[1414.00 - 1418.72] one two three four of epson bar it'll
[1416.56 - 1420.88] drop it in all kinds of situations
[1418.72 - 1423.20] it can drop it and then you contract it
[1420.88 - 1425.68] easier it can drop it and then
[1423.20 - 1426.96] you actually go into that mononucleosis
[1425.68 - 1429.36] easier i mean but
[1426.96 - 1430.32] at this phase especially at this phase
[1429.36 - 1432.56] this is when
[1430.32 - 1434.72] you're getting routine blood tests you
[1432.56 - 1437.36] know you're doing your thing in life
[1434.72 - 1438.56] and boom it's it's when it's happening
[1437.36 - 1439.92] if you guys haven't listened to the
[1438.56 - 1441.60] episode
[1439.92 - 1444.08] definitely here you know listen when you
[1441.60 - 1446.08] can alright so you can listen medical
[1444.08 - 1447.36] mean podcast at apple podcast link is in
[1446.08 - 1449.68] the description
[1447.36 - 1451.28] it's the blood draw bloodletting um
[1449.68 - 1454.72] vampirism episode
[1451.28 - 1457.36] okay so that's where the blood draw
[1454.72 - 1458.40] problem really sets sets in so let's go
[1457.36 - 1462.48] into epstein-barr
[1458.40 - 1464.64] stage three once the virus settles into
[1462.48 - 1466.64] your liver spleen or reproductive system
[1464.64 - 1469.76] organs it nests there
[1466.64 - 1471.12] it's nesting so then you live your life
[1469.76 - 1473.04] you live your life you're doing your
[1471.12 - 1476.16] thing no big deal
[1473.04 - 1479.28] life is back to normal all is well it's
[1476.16 - 1479.28] nesting in there right
[1479.92 - 1488.48] so now the upstairs
[1486.24 - 1490.32] guys now the epstein-barr virus is
[1488.48 - 1492.00] nesting inside your liver
[1490.32 - 1494.16] that's where it is props are getting out
[1492.00 - 1496.40] of hand right so much
[1494.16 - 1497.36] so the epstein bar is sitting inside the
[1496.40 - 1499.60] liver
[1497.36 - 1501.68] it's sitting inside the reproductive
[1499.60 - 1505.20] system too
[1501.68 - 1507.04] whether you're pregnant or not
[1505.20 - 1508.96] it's sitting inside the reproductive
[1507.04 - 1512.48] system okay
[1508.96 - 1515.92] it can sit inside the prostate
[1512.48 - 1517.76] in men but the liver is the big one
[1515.92 - 1519.12] reproductive system is the second
[1517.76 - 1522.08] biggest place
[1519.12 - 1522.72] all right it can sit inside the spleen
[1522.08 - 1525.92] so
[1522.72 - 1529.12] and that's what it does all right
[1525.92 - 1531.44] okay so you guys now
[1529.12 - 1534.48] as that virus is nesting i gotta make
[1531.44 - 1534.48] the banana boats
[1534.56 - 1538.72] this is what i gotta do we gotta get
[1537.04 - 1540.56] through that
[1538.72 - 1542.00] from this point on when a doctor tests
[1540.56 - 1544.32] for epstein-barr she or he
[1542.00 - 1546.40] will most likely find antibodies and
[1544.32 - 1549.52] take these to indicate
[1546.40 - 1552.96] a past infection that was in the past
[1549.52 - 1556.32] that was in the past okay
[1552.96 - 1559.44] well uh oh yeah i'm here
[1556.32 - 1561.76] what is it i had epstein barr
[1559.44 - 1564.00] so you're saying i had epstein barr you
[1561.76 - 1566.72] found antibodies
[1564.00 - 1568.56] that showed i had epstein-barr but
[1566.72 - 1570.56] that's not the problem
[1568.56 - 1571.68] so i don't have epstein-barr now you're
[1570.56 - 1573.36] saying
[1571.68 - 1575.36] you're saying that epstein-barr is only
[1573.36 - 1576.40] the mono i had and i'm showing an
[1575.36 - 1578.24] antibody
[1576.40 - 1580.16] but that's not why i got this tingles
[1578.24 - 1583.44] and numbness on my shoulder
[1580.16 - 1586.08] and my my my back and that's not why my
[1583.44 - 1588.00] fingers feel like numb and i they turn
[1586.08 - 1589.92] purple all the time
[1588.00 - 1591.68] and that's not like that's not why i
[1589.92 - 1594.72] have any of that it's not what
[1591.68 - 1595.44] okay okay okay so i have the antibody
[1594.72 - 1598.56] though
[1595.44 - 1601.60] they're wrong
[1598.56 - 1605.04] this is something that's been messed up
[1601.60 - 1608.32] in our system for a very long time
[1605.04 - 1609.92] they're completely wrong
[1608.32 - 1611.44] and that's the difference medical media
[1609.92 - 1612.88] information brought this to the world
[1611.44 - 1616.64] that's why people are healing
[1612.88 - 1619.68] because you still got the epstein barr
[1616.64 - 1622.24] so the doctor finds the antibodies and
[1619.68 - 1625.28] take these to indicate a past infection
[1622.24 - 1628.16] when epstein-barr was in its mono phase
[1625.28 - 1630.00] the doctor will not find the epstein bar
[1628.16 - 1631.20] presently active anymore
[1630.00 - 1633.20] because that was when it was in its
[1631.20 - 1634.88] monophase right so that's what's going
[1633.20 - 1637.52] on there
[1634.88 - 1638.88] okay important enough the confusion here
[1637.52 - 1640.00] is one of the biggest blunders in the
[1638.88 - 1642.00] medical hit in medical
[1640.00 - 1643.52] history this is how this virus has
[1642.00 - 1645.60] slipped through the cracks
[1643.52 - 1646.96] because the doctors don't believe you
[1645.60 - 1649.76] have epstein-barr
[1646.96 - 1650.72] even with the antibody they find and
[1649.76 - 1652.00] even then
[1650.72 - 1654.40] it doesn't mean they're going to find an
[1652.00 - 1656.88] antibody either different varieties of
[1654.40 - 1658.96] epstein-barr elude blood tests which is
[1656.88 - 1663.12] a whole other thing you guys
[1658.96 - 1665.20] okay and so that's another thing unless
[1663.12 - 1667.68] you have already followed the measures
[1665.20 - 1669.92] outlined in this new edition
[1667.68 - 1671.12] in this book to kill the epstein-barr
[1669.92 - 1673.20] virus
[1671.12 - 1675.44] in fact it's still alive and causing new
[1673.20 - 1677.36] symptoms and it eludes the tests that's
[1675.44 - 1679.04] because it's living in the liver like i
[1677.36 - 1682.32] was showing you guys
[1679.04 - 1685.60] it's living there in the liver and
[1682.32 - 1687.12] spleen reproductive system and the test
[1685.60 - 1690.00] to detect this has not
[1687.12 - 1691.52] yet been invented so they have not
[1690.00 - 1694.88] invented a test
[1691.52 - 1696.56] to know where the virus is we're so
[1694.88 - 1699.12] behind with chronic illness like
[1696.56 - 1701.04] decades behind i mean a hundred years
[1699.12 - 1702.16] from now and people are
[1701.04 - 1703.04] a hundred years from now people are
[1702.16 - 1705.04] going to read they're going to be
[1703.04 - 1707.92] dusting off these medical medium books
[1705.04 - 1709.04] i'll be gone all right i'll be gone all
[1707.92 - 1710.80] right
[1709.04 - 1713.60] and if the world didn't blow up from
[1710.80 - 1716.32] nuclear bombs
[1713.60 - 1717.36] or anything else they're gonna dust off
[1716.32 - 1719.04] these books
[1717.36 - 1721.68] and they're gonna be like hey did you
[1719.04 - 1721.68] know this guy
[1722.16 - 1728.32] hey did you know this guy knew
[1725.76 - 1729.04] wait a minute he's saying the virus is
[1728.32 - 1731.04] still in us
[1729.04 - 1732.64] did we did we come up with a way of
[1731.04 - 1733.36] figuring it out that it's still in the
[1732.64 - 1736.80] liver
[1733.36 - 1738.16] we haven't 100 years later
[1736.80 - 1741.84] but wait a minute did you hear about
[1738.16 - 1741.84] that new green tea study
[1742.32 - 1745.68] they'll be working on the next green tea
[1744.00 - 1747.36] study 100 years from now
[1745.68 - 1749.44] and not figuring out what's going on all
[1747.36 - 1751.60] right
[1749.44 - 1752.56] with the virus hiding undetected in your
[1751.60 - 1754.96] organs
[1752.56 - 1757.28] your body assumes it's won the war and
[1754.96 - 1759.36] the invader has been destroyed
[1757.28 - 1762.56] your immune system returns to its normal
[1759.36 - 1764.40] state your mononucleosis ends
[1762.56 - 1766.56] and your doctor tells you that you're
[1764.40 - 1769.12] healthy unfortunately the epstein-barr
[1766.56 - 1772.24] virus has barely begun its voyage
[1769.12 - 1774.64] hence you guys probably know about this
[1772.24 - 1775.36] eggs and pains balance issues vertigo
[1774.64 - 1778.24] tinnitus
[1775.36 - 1778.96] tingles and numbness burning skin pain
[1778.24 - 1784.00] in the neck
[1778.96 - 1787.52] back legs knee issues plantar fasciitis
[1784.00 - 1790.72] right mourns neuroma how about that one
[1787.52 - 1794.56] you know all of these pots okay
[1790.72 - 1796.64] reynolds lupus cfs eczema
[1794.56 - 1798.60] just epstein-barr is involved in there
[1796.64 - 1800.72] all the i'm just at pcos
[1798.60 - 1801.76] endometriosis did you have anything like
[1800.72 - 1805.04] that fibroids
[1801.76 - 1806.72] epstein-barr if you have a typical
[1805.04 - 1808.16] variety of steam bar could lie dormant
[1806.72 - 1808.80] in your organs for years that's why
[1808.16 - 1810.32] you'll say
[1808.80 - 1811.92] like i read the comment earlier it's
[1810.32 - 1813.84] like how come it doesn't happen to these
[1811.92 - 1816.72] other people but it happens to
[1813.84 - 1818.80] it happens to these other people so
[1816.72 - 1820.24] typically it can hide for decades
[1818.80 - 1821.68] without you knowing it especially if
[1820.24 - 1825.52] your immune system hasn't
[1821.68 - 1826.88] been weakened but you keep on getting
[1825.52 - 1828.00] the blood draws and here's the problem
[1826.88 - 1829.92] you might be somebody that doesn't even
[1828.00 - 1831.84] get a blood blood test
[1829.92 - 1833.20] i've known people they go 10 years 15
[1831.84 - 1834.96] years they don't even get a blood test
[1833.20 - 1837.04] right the minute they started getting
[1834.96 - 1838.48] sick they're getting the blood drawn
[1837.04 - 1839.76] from them all the time that's why you
[1838.48 - 1841.52] have to listen to the the
[1839.76 - 1843.28] medical mean podcast at apple podcast
[1841.52 - 1844.08] the blood draw episode you've got to
[1843.28 - 1846.40] listen
[1844.08 - 1847.60] you guys i'm just i know some many of
[1846.40 - 1850.40] you guys listened
[1847.60 - 1850.80] but so many haven't you gotta listen to
[1850.40 - 1856.00] that
[1850.80 - 1856.00] it's important to know so um
[1858.80 - 1862.00] so let's talk about the blood they take
[1860.80 - 1864.08] in this situation
[1862.00 - 1866.40] so i'm just gonna grab my tomato sauce
[1864.08 - 1868.00] jar for a second if you guys don't mind
[1866.40 - 1870.32] and i'm gonna do a little blood
[1868.00 - 1874.48] extraction right here
[1870.32 - 1876.48] okay now they take a lot of blood from
[1874.48 - 1879.12] everybody
[1876.48 - 1881.36] that's real blood in there no it's not
[1879.12 - 1883.52] strained tomatoes right
[1881.36 - 1884.72] they take a lot of blood from everybody
[1883.52 - 1888.48] is what they do
[1884.72 - 1892.48] so important to know
[1888.48 - 1894.00] and your immune system could stay strong
[1892.48 - 1895.76] and your epstein-barr isn't causing a
[1894.00 - 1899.28] problem yet it's dormant
[1895.76 - 1901.12] inside the liver okay and you're
[1899.28 - 1903.12] you're not challenged either maybe
[1901.12 - 1904.80] you're not exposed to enough pesticides
[1903.12 - 1905.92] herbicides fungicides
[1904.80 - 1908.00] maybe you're somebody that doesn't have
[1905.92 - 1909.04] the air fresheners in their home maybe
[1908.00 - 1912.00] you're not under stress
[1909.04 - 1912.56] maybe you didn't have that divorce maybe
[1912.00 - 1914.96] you know
[1912.56 - 1915.76] financial problems aren't there whatever
[1914.96 - 1918.00] it is
[1915.76 - 1920.40] you don't have enough triggers you know
[1918.00 - 1921.92] you haven't been triggered enough right
[1920.40 - 1924.00] and you got kind of a docile
[1921.92 - 1926.08] epstein-barr variety it's not
[1924.00 - 1927.60] a real aggressive one so all that's
[1926.08 - 1929.28] happening and then
[1927.60 - 1930.96] what happens is whether you start
[1929.28 - 1931.44] getting your first symptoms to begin
[1930.96 - 1933.20] with
[1931.44 - 1934.80] happens to everybody maybe they're
[1933.20 - 1937.12] getting hormone tested because they got
[1934.80 - 1939.20] the hot flashes their heart palpitations
[1937.12 - 1940.56] maybe they don't feel good maybe they
[1939.20 - 1941.28] just want to check up they're gaining
[1940.56 - 1943.04] some weight
[1941.28 - 1944.40] and they get all that blood taken so now
[1943.04 - 1946.72] they get 70
[1944.40 - 1948.88] milliliters of blood 100 milliliters of
[1946.72 - 1950.16] blood 140 milliliters of blood taken
[1948.88 - 1952.24] from them
[1950.16 - 1953.76] and with that taken from them it's
[1952.24 - 1955.28] dropping their immune system so they get
[1953.76 - 1957.12] all this blood taken for them
[1955.28 - 1958.64] from them when they get their blood test
[1957.12 - 1960.72] and their white counts in there
[1958.64 - 1962.64] their red blood cells are in there and
[1960.72 - 1965.84] they're losing this
[1962.64 - 1968.80] and then epstein barr is in the organs
[1965.84 - 1970.48] okay and creeping up they'll say that
[1968.80 - 1970.88] you'll replenish your blood perfectly
[1970.48 - 1973.20] fine
[1970.88 - 1974.72] perfectly quick perfectly easy it's not
[1973.20 - 1976.72] how it works
[1974.72 - 1978.08] it takes a long time sometimes three to
[1976.72 - 1979.04] six months to get your immune system
[1978.08 - 1981.84] back up to par
[1979.04 - 1983.68] red blood cells and white white count
[1981.84 - 1985.76] cbc your complete blood count
[1983.68 - 1987.44] takes time and anybody who's got
[1985.76 - 1989.52] symptoms they're already dealing with
[1987.44 - 1990.72] the weakened immune system to begin with
[1989.52 - 1992.32] so that's important enough
[1990.72 - 1994.40] now they take all this blood and they
[1992.32 - 1995.76] say they need it you know and this
[1994.40 - 1998.08] this is your sum of the blood they'll
[1995.76 - 1999.12] take three times that they'll take four
[1998.08 - 2001.44] times that
[1999.12 - 2004.24] that's the other thing too you'll get
[2001.44 - 2005.52] six vial seven vials ten vials and then
[2004.24 - 2007.04] if you're sick for a little while you
[2005.52 - 2008.48] got to go to the specialist because now
[2007.04 - 2010.16] you got to look for another doctor
[2008.48 - 2012.32] specialist doesn't care if you had blood
[2010.16 - 2014.32] test blood work done two weeks ago
[2012.32 - 2016.00] they want another 28 vials and this
[2014.32 - 2017.20] happens to a lot of people it may not be
[2016.00 - 2020.24] happening to you
[2017.20 - 2022.24] but it's totally wasted a lot of people
[2020.24 - 2025.04] that's why this is so critical right
[2022.24 - 2027.76] all they need to do this is all they
[2025.04 - 2031.12] need for blood tests this is it okay
[2027.76 - 2033.76] um so let's do a little bit of this
[2031.12 - 2035.36] they just need this much so i'm going to
[2033.76 - 2036.72] put a little drop on here
[2035.36 - 2039.28] they only need that much i don't know if
[2036.72 - 2042.16] you can see that
[2039.28 - 2042.16] is that too bright
[2043.04 - 2049.28] all right this is a very runny
[2047.12 - 2051.20] a very runny sauce for some reason it's
[2049.28 - 2054.00] not doing what it needs to do
[2051.20 - 2055.92] so you see that blood drop right there
[2054.00 - 2058.56] they only need that much
[2055.92 - 2060.48] that's all they need less than that exac
[2058.56 - 2061.36] absolutely less than that just for one
[2060.48 - 2064.40] test
[2061.36 - 2064.72] two tests three tests you can get three
[2064.40 - 2067.12] four
[2064.72 - 2069.12] five tests out of that get your
[2067.12 - 2073.20] metabolic panel your thyroid panel
[2069.12 - 2075.12] you can get um you know your cbc count
[2073.20 - 2076.48] you can get your cholesterol done you
[2075.12 - 2078.40] can get your a
[2076.48 - 2081.04] a anti-nuclear antigen test you can get
[2078.40 - 2083.68] your cbc reactive protein test
[2081.04 - 2086.40] you can get your deficiency vitamin
[2083.68 - 2089.44] mineral deficiency tests right
[2086.40 - 2091.04] genus is that really pisses me off
[2089.44 - 2092.80] and you got to listen tina did you
[2091.04 - 2094.88] listen to the podcast episode
[2092.80 - 2095.84] okay link is in the description all
[2094.88 - 2097.76] right so
[2095.84 - 2098.88] it's the blood draw episode please
[2097.76 - 2100.56] listen chrissy said
[2098.88 - 2103.84] if they only need a small amount then
[2100.56 - 2103.84] why do they take so much
[2104.72 - 2109.92] because something's terribly wrong
[2107.60 - 2112.08] that's why the system's broken
[2109.92 - 2113.68] they don't want to fix it nobody wants
[2112.08 - 2115.04] to admit they've been taking too much
[2113.68 - 2118.24] it's like you're in it too
[2115.04 - 2119.28] deep what do you do right you're in it
[2118.24 - 2121.68] too deep
[2119.28 - 2122.96] what do you do you got the entire
[2121.68 - 2124.88] medical system
[2122.96 - 2126.24] robbing and stealing and thefting
[2124.88 - 2128.16] people's blood
[2126.24 - 2130.08] knocking their immune system down
[2128.16 - 2132.16] killing them
[2130.08 - 2133.20] if they got diseases like cancer
[2132.16 - 2135.68] quickening
[2133.20 - 2137.44] uh and quickening their life as far as
[2135.68 - 2140.80] their lifespan to a bad
[2137.44 - 2144.08] place right deficiencies rampant
[2140.80 - 2146.40] creating rampant deficiencies removing
[2144.08 - 2148.56] white count all the time your bone
[2146.40 - 2150.56] marrow has to go into overload
[2148.56 - 2151.60] okay why are they doing it when you're
[2150.56 - 2152.64] in it too deep
[2151.60 - 2154.72] they're not going to make an
[2152.64 - 2158.08] announcement and say
[2154.72 - 2159.36] we messed up it's not
[2158.08 - 2161.36] good because then everybody's going to
[2159.36 - 2162.88] question it everybody every good
[2161.36 - 2163.60] scientist is going to question it all of
[2162.88 - 2165.68] a sudden like
[2163.60 - 2166.80] wait a minute what do you mean you
[2165.68 - 2168.16] messed up
[2166.80 - 2169.84] like so that's what's going to happen
[2168.16 - 2171.36] now so all of a sudden every single
[2169.84 - 2172.56] scientist is going to get a phone call
[2171.36 - 2174.80] they're like
[2172.56 - 2176.40] what what do you need what do you mean
[2174.80 - 2179.04] we screwed up
[2176.40 - 2181.92] you mean we've been taking everybody's
[2179.04 - 2184.00] blood and removing their immune system
[2181.92 - 2185.36] people with cancer are dying really
[2184.00 - 2186.08] quick because of it because they have no
[2185.36 - 2187.36] immune system
[2186.08 - 2189.12] left because they're getting their blood
[2187.36 - 2192.72] drawn every week
[2189.12 - 2194.16] two weeks three weeks um we're taking
[2192.72 - 2196.24] blood out of pregnant women
[2194.16 - 2197.92] you mean that was affecting babies
[2196.24 - 2198.64] because we're taking eight vials of
[2197.92 - 2201.36] blood
[2198.64 - 2202.08] out of pregnant women wait so all this
[2201.36 - 2203.52] is wrong
[2202.08 - 2206.64] what are you talking about it's all
[2203.52 - 2209.60] wrong what do we do and just you can't
[2206.64 - 2210.08] you know you can't how many lawsuits you
[2209.60 - 2212.40] know
[2210.08 - 2213.20] who's gonna get sued who made the big
[2212.40 - 2216.00] mistake
[2213.20 - 2217.04] listen to the podcast so link is in the
[2216.00 - 2218.88] description
[2217.04 - 2220.32] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast
[2218.88 - 2221.92] that's the place to listen to it that's
[2220.32 - 2224.96] the uncensored version
[2221.92 - 2226.24] so you only need this much that's it but
[2224.96 - 2229.12] they take
[2226.24 - 2231.28] exorbitant amount of blood from people
[2229.12 - 2233.28] and that's the next thing too so
[2231.28 - 2235.36] but where does that lead us to take this
[2233.28 - 2237.76] much blood where does it lead us
[2235.36 - 2239.28] it leads us in a bad place we lose our
[2237.76 - 2241.44] immune systems
[2239.28 - 2243.76] so back to the symptoms we'll head there
[2241.44 - 2247.44] a little bit
[2243.76 - 2248.88] so now the virus okay in stage three
[2247.44 - 2250.64] we're talking about
[2248.88 - 2252.48] the virus because we get our immune
[2250.64 - 2254.88] system lowers we're getting the blood
[2252.48 - 2257.04] taken from us we're getting blood draws
[2254.88 - 2258.48] it doesn't have to hit us a week after
[2257.04 - 2259.12] we get the blood draw but a lot of
[2258.48 - 2261.60] people
[2259.12 - 2262.80] they're wasted they're wasted a lot of
[2261.60 - 2264.48] pregnant women they get their blood
[2262.80 - 2266.40] tested they get their blood draw
[2264.48 - 2267.68] they're wasted for a week or two they
[2266.40 - 2269.84] can't function
[2267.68 - 2270.96] after the blood test and you know what
[2269.84 - 2272.72] it leads them to
[2270.96 - 2275.20] wait a minute there might be a problem
[2272.72 - 2277.36] you know it's like all of a sudden now
[2275.20 - 2278.80] we got a pregnant woman who's not
[2277.36 - 2280.88] functioning good
[2278.80 - 2282.64] after the blood test blood draw but they
[2280.88 - 2284.24] don't know why they don't know it's the
[2282.64 - 2286.72] blood draw that did it
[2284.24 - 2288.48] so guess what you better get in here
[2286.72 - 2290.32] because you better get into the office
[2288.48 - 2291.76] because we need to test you again we
[2290.32 - 2293.44] need to get more blood from you
[2291.76 - 2295.60] there's so many women that are pregnant
[2293.44 - 2297.44] that get they get bloodletted
[2295.60 - 2298.72] while they're pregnant with their baby
[2297.44 - 2302.00] and they're getting blood draw
[2298.72 - 2302.48] every week two weeks eight vials seven
[2302.00 - 2304.96] vials
[2302.48 - 2306.00] five vials 12 vials and they're doing it
[2304.96 - 2307.60] because they don't know why they're not
[2306.00 - 2307.92] feeling good there's so many women that
[2307.60 - 2309.84] are
[2307.92 - 2313.68] caught in this vicious cycle it's an
[2309.84 - 2315.36] evil evil vicious cycle right
[2313.68 - 2317.28] so as the immune system breaks down and
[2315.36 - 2318.56] weakens i'm reading the new edition by
[2317.28 - 2319.84] the way if you guys don't have the new
[2318.56 - 2323.92] edition
[2319.84 - 2326.48] uh you should stress in life okay
[2323.92 - 2326.96] um pregnancy can lower the immune system
[2326.48 - 2329.76] too
[2326.96 - 2330.72] it's just normal 50 of the of a woman's
[2329.76 - 2333.12] immune system
[2330.72 - 2334.08] protects the baby that's you know also
[2333.12 - 2336.00] menstruation
[2334.08 - 2338.08] if you're not pregnant immune system
[2336.00 - 2339.36] lowers okay i've talked about that a lot
[2338.08 - 2343.12] of times
[2339.36 - 2345.52] so yeah toby says we're at war
[2343.12 - 2346.48] loon says so sad it's it's unbelievable
[2345.52 - 2348.88] right
[2346.48 - 2350.56] it's just really uncool so what happens
[2348.88 - 2352.84] is all of a sudden
[2350.56 - 2354.40] the virus makes a break it leaves the
[2352.84 - 2356.16] liver
[2354.40 - 2357.44] because your immune system has been
[2356.16 - 2360.64] lowered
[2357.44 - 2361.36] and it heads off to your thyroid so now
[2360.64 - 2363.04] the virus
[2361.36 - 2364.48] heads to your thyroid and that's where
[2363.04 - 2366.80] it goes next
[2364.48 - 2368.88] because that's the next phase and
[2366.80 - 2370.48] sometimes if the virus was just
[2368.88 - 2371.92] in the liver and it didn't settle in
[2370.48 - 2372.88] other places it'll start going other
[2371.92 - 2375.76] places too
[2372.88 - 2377.36] not just not just the thyroid the
[2375.76 - 2378.64] thyroid's a common place now you got
[2377.36 - 2380.96] hypothyroidism
[2378.64 - 2382.40] so now you're a woman or a man that's
[2380.96 - 2385.68] got hypothyroidism
[2382.40 - 2387.44] or you get a stage of hashimoto's
[2385.68 - 2389.12] you get a mild hashimoto's or an
[2387.44 - 2390.00] aggressive hashimoto's depending on the
[2389.12 - 2391.60] virus
[2390.00 - 2393.36] what variety it was that i was talking
[2391.60 - 2395.28] about okay and then
[2393.36 - 2396.96] now you're somebody that's getting your
[2395.28 - 2399.36] thyroid tested
[2396.96 - 2400.00] all the time so let's just take more
[2399.36 - 2402.08] blood
[2400.00 - 2403.44] okay we're gonna need eight more tubes
[2402.08 - 2404.88] we're gonna need five more tubes we're
[2403.44 - 2407.44] gonna need four more full
[2404.88 - 2409.68] tubes and now you're getting more blood
[2407.44 - 2412.72] drawn more blood drawn more blood drawn
[2409.68 - 2415.84] okay every six weeks sometimes
[2412.72 - 2417.52] every three weeks and then now you're
[2415.84 - 2418.72] at the doctor's office all the time and
[2417.52 - 2420.08] you're getting your blood drawn so it's
[2418.72 - 2422.16] a whole other thing too
[2420.08 - 2423.60] keep that in mind sometimes every three
[2422.16 - 2424.24] months but you're getting those blood
[2423.60 - 2426.24] draws
[2424.24 - 2427.76] so now you're at the next phase your
[2426.24 - 2429.92] immune system is weakening
[2427.76 - 2431.60] you've got epstein-barr virus in your
[2429.92 - 2433.44] thyroid okay
[2431.60 - 2435.36] you're losing your immune system during
[2433.44 - 2437.28] draws but you're losing your immune
[2435.36 - 2438.96] system anyway because life here
[2437.28 - 2440.72] we're always our immune system is always
[2438.96 - 2443.04] battling for us it's always up against
[2440.72 - 2445.60] colognes perfumes air fresheners
[2443.04 - 2447.60] scented candles pesticides herbicides
[2445.60 - 2450.16] fungicides toxic heavy metals mercury
[2447.60 - 2453.76] aluminum lead arsenic cadmium copper
[2450.16 - 2456.64] it's against petroleum products plastics
[2453.76 - 2457.12] chemtrails floating out the sky exhaust
[2456.64 - 2459.44] fumes
[2457.12 - 2460.40] smog pollution polluted water
[2459.44 - 2463.44] pharmaceuticals
[2460.40 - 2465.12] in our drinking water and our immune
[2463.44 - 2466.56] system is already up against all that
[2465.12 - 2467.12] and that's just to name a few not
[2466.56 - 2469.60] including
[2467.12 - 2470.96] asbestos still blowing around ddt still
[2469.60 - 2471.84] blowing around so that's what we're up
[2470.96 - 2474.72] against
[2471.84 - 2475.60] so now we're at stage three of
[2474.72 - 2477.12] epstein-barr
[2475.60 - 2478.72] and we're getting our blood tested a lot
[2477.12 - 2481.60] and losing our immune system
[2478.72 - 2483.04] so now all of a sudden we have a
[2481.60 - 2484.56] weakened immune system even
[2483.04 - 2486.24] past this we're getting more and more
[2484.56 - 2487.84] blood draws we're losing our immune
[2486.24 - 2488.96] system more and more blood draws more
[2487.84 - 2491.76] and more blood straws
[2488.96 - 2492.24] we're losing our immune system the virus
[2491.76 - 2495.68] then
[2492.24 - 2498.96] builds up enough of
[2495.68 - 2500.00] other viruses meaning the same type of
[2498.96 - 2503.12] virus
[2500.00 - 2504.00] it's proliferating you're eating foods
[2503.12 - 2505.60] that feed it
[2504.00 - 2507.36] because you're told now you got a
[2505.60 - 2507.68] thyroid problem you better be eating
[2507.36 - 2510.64] these
[2507.68 - 2512.08] delicious eggs right here so your doctor
[2510.64 - 2514.96] is going to say you need to be on
[2512.08 - 2516.64] eggs you need to be on healthy proteins
[2514.96 - 2517.52] you need to be on cheese that's a cheese
[2516.64 - 2519.84] stick right there
[2517.52 - 2520.72] you need to be on your cheese sticks you
[2519.84 - 2522.08] need to be on
[2520.72 - 2524.32] you should have your hard-boiled eggs
[2522.08 - 2527.44] and salads and get your protein
[2524.32 - 2529.76] get all that you need that too and now
[2527.44 - 2530.56] you're feeding you're feeding the
[2529.76 - 2532.32] viruses
[2530.56 - 2534.48] it's proliferating you're getting blood
[2532.32 - 2537.20] draws your immune system is dropping
[2534.48 - 2538.32] and then the virus turns into a real
[2537.20 - 2540.56] crap storm
[2538.32 - 2541.52] and now it's stage four for neurological
[2540.56 - 2543.76] symptoms
[2541.52 - 2543.76] okay
[2545.68 - 2550.32] all right so you know so the bottom line
[2549.92 - 2552.72] is
[2550.32 - 2554.56] i talk about the plague today in the
[2552.72 - 2558.08] book by the way
[2554.56 - 2560.00] very important to know um
[2558.08 - 2561.28] so i talk about the plague in this book
[2560.00 - 2562.80] you might want to read it if you have
[2561.28 - 2564.32] any questions on that
[2562.80 - 2565.84] now we're in stage four epstein-barr
[2564.32 - 2569.60] neurological symptoms
[2565.84 - 2572.32] the virus gets strong er
[2569.60 - 2573.84] starts releasing neurotoxins so the
[2572.32 - 2575.44] virus gets an appetite
[2573.84 - 2577.84] starts to release neurotoxins those
[2575.44 - 2579.36] neurotoxins spread throughout the body
[2577.84 - 2580.88] and now you're up against your
[2579.36 - 2583.68] neurological issues
[2580.88 - 2584.24] tingles and numbness aches and pains
[2583.68 - 2586.64] right
[2584.24 - 2587.84] burning skin pain in the neck pain in
[2586.64 - 2590.88] the back
[2587.84 - 2594.32] tinnitus vertigo dizziness
[2590.88 - 2596.88] fatigue fatigue
[2594.32 - 2599.36] so you will be up against that fatigue
[2596.88 - 2602.08] and then when you have fatigue
[2599.36 - 2603.28] um now you're just at the doctor's
[2602.08 - 2604.48] office all the time but
[2603.28 - 2606.24] now you're not just at the doctor's
[2604.48 - 2608.00] office you're at the specialist they're
[2606.24 - 2608.56] going to need 28 vials they're going to
[2608.00 - 2611.28] need
[2608.56 - 2612.72] 18 vials they'll need 14 vials 11 vials
[2611.28 - 2614.16] whatever it is they knock your immune
[2612.72 - 2616.32] system down more and more now you're at
[2614.16 - 2618.56] the lyme doctor too
[2616.32 - 2620.56] now lime doctor wants 40 vials happens
[2618.56 - 2621.92] all the time right
[2620.56 - 2623.84] now the thing is you guys i'm not
[2621.92 - 2625.20] against blood work i'm not against blood
[2623.84 - 2626.64] tests i want you to get your blood
[2625.20 - 2628.64] tested whenever you feel like it
[2626.64 - 2630.24] whatever your doctor's asking right
[2628.64 - 2631.92] but when you listen to the podcast you
[2630.24 - 2633.84] can protect yourself
[2631.92 - 2636.64] so you don't get scammed out of your
[2633.84 - 2638.96] blood scammed out of your immune system
[2636.64 - 2641.04] because that's what it really is it's a
[2638.96 - 2642.16] it's a dangerous scam that's hurt a lot
[2641.04 - 2643.84] of people and they take
[2642.16 - 2645.76] way too much blood they don't need to
[2643.84 - 2649.12] take that much blood and you can
[2645.76 - 2649.52] be your own boss and learn how to be
[2649.12 - 2650.96] like
[2649.52 - 2652.40] well there's something i can do to
[2650.96 - 2653.36] protect myself and that's what's
[2652.40 - 2656.40] important so
[2653.36 - 2658.56] i want to make some banana
[2656.40 - 2659.92] lettuce boats in a minute too so stage
[2658.56 - 2662.40] four i've seen the bar we'll cover that
[2659.92 - 2665.68] for one second too
[2662.40 - 2668.56] so now we're in stage four epstein barr
[2665.68 - 2668.56] let's go in there
[2672.08 - 2676.40] stage four of steen bar the ultimate
[2674.24 - 2678.00] goal of the epstein-barr virus
[2676.40 - 2679.76] is for some of its viral cells to
[2678.00 - 2681.44] venture past your thyroid like i was
[2679.76 - 2682.40] talking about before i already explained
[2681.44 - 2684.56] it
[2682.40 - 2686.00] and inflame your central nervous system
[2684.56 - 2689.36] so the virus builds up
[2686.00 - 2692.24] its numbers it releases uh
[2689.36 - 2695.28] um the neurotoxins the neurotoxins land
[2692.24 - 2697.76] on your vagus nerve your phrenic nerves
[2695.28 - 2699.12] and you get the nerve inflammation so
[2697.76 - 2700.72] now you're getting all kinds of
[2699.12 - 2702.72] inflammatory markers if you get a lyme
[2700.72 - 2703.28] disease test that's an inflammation test
[2702.72 - 2704.64] really
[2703.28 - 2707.28] you're not getting tested for the
[2704.64 - 2709.60] bacteria they say you are but they don't
[2707.28 - 2711.44] i know how the lyme labs work okay i
[2709.60 - 2712.88] know a lot of different scientists
[2711.44 - 2715.36] a lot of different lab technicians
[2712.88 - 2716.88] around the world i know a lot of doctors
[2715.36 - 2718.72] what happens is they don't find the
[2716.88 - 2722.16] borrelia at the lime
[2718.72 - 2724.48] at the lab they look for elevations of
[2722.16 - 2726.08] inflammation similar to an a a or c
[2724.48 - 2728.40] reactive protein test
[2726.08 - 2729.12] then they put the bacteria of choice
[2728.40 - 2731.52] next to that
[2729.12 - 2732.56] inflammation it's really a guessing game
[2731.52 - 2735.12] but they plug
[2732.56 - 2736.96] the name of the bacteria in they don't
[2735.12 - 2740.00] find the bacteria see
[2736.96 - 2743.04] you might get an mthfr gene mutation
[2740.00 - 2744.88] test positive another inflammatory test
[2743.04 - 2746.08] you don't have a gene mutation i can
[2744.88 - 2747.60] tell you this right now
[2746.08 - 2749.28] when people get rid of their epstein
[2747.60 - 2751.20] bars like many have
[2749.28 - 2752.40] over the years that i've seen their gene
[2751.20 - 2755.20] mutation test
[2752.40 - 2756.80] often gets normal wait a minute they say
[2755.20 - 2759.28] you can never reverse
[2756.80 - 2760.64] an mthfr gene mutation it's impossible
[2759.28 - 2761.76] to reverse it because it's a gene
[2760.64 - 2764.72] mutation
[2761.76 - 2766.72] wrong why does it go away because the
[2764.72 - 2768.88] gene mutation test is an inflammatory
[2766.72 - 2771.36] marker it's not a gene mutation
[2768.88 - 2773.28] they call it that but it's not so that's
[2771.36 - 2774.32] another pseudoscience technique they
[2773.28 - 2775.44] have so
[2774.32 - 2776.96] that's the whole thing i mean there's a
[2775.44 - 2777.44] lot of pseudoscience out there and
[2776.96 - 2779.76] that's a
[2777.44 - 2781.52] that's a big thing to understand so when
[2779.76 - 2783.36] you get the tinnitus the anxiety the
[2781.52 - 2784.00] tingles and numbness the chronic fatigue
[2783.36 - 2786.64] the eye
[2784.00 - 2788.40] floaters you're dealing with the
[2786.64 - 2789.68] epstein-barr stage four that's all it's
[2788.40 - 2791.28] not scary
[2789.68 - 2792.64] you know how many people reverse and
[2791.28 - 2793.28] heal that with medical medium books
[2792.64 - 2795.44] that's why
[2793.28 - 2797.28] they're so known people get rid of that
[2795.44 - 2799.04] they get rid of the fibro pain the nerve
[2797.28 - 2802.96] pain
[2799.04 - 2807.12] dino hey why blood draw why blood draw
[2802.96 - 2808.72] is are not accurate for diagnosing ebv
[2807.12 - 2810.88] so it's talking about how epstein-barr
[2808.72 - 2813.04] works they have a difficult time locking
[2810.88 - 2814.16] down epstein-barr they find the antibody
[2813.04 - 2816.00] but they think
[2814.16 - 2817.36] that was when you had mono sometime in
[2816.00 - 2819.36] your life so the doctor would be like oh
[2817.36 - 2822.88] you had mono a long time ago
[2819.36 - 2826.72] and um and ebv hides in organs
[2822.88 - 2828.64] it hides in the thyroid now science
[2826.72 - 2830.00] took medical medium information recently
[2828.64 - 2832.32] and they said they found a link to
[2830.00 - 2833.92] epstein-barr to the thyroid now
[2832.32 - 2836.00] but they got it from the medical media
[2833.92 - 2839.28] book one which was published first
[2836.00 - 2840.96] it's actually hilarious right so
[2839.28 - 2842.96] that's how it works it hides in organs
[2840.96 - 2844.48] hides in the liver hides in the thyroid
[2842.96 - 2847.60] it hides in organs very
[2844.48 - 2850.08] very very important to know and
[2847.60 - 2852.80] monolith mononucleosis when you get mono
[2850.08 - 2855.28] at one point that's a full-blown
[2852.80 - 2855.92] blood infection of epstein-barr but
[2855.28 - 2857.60] that's
[2855.92 - 2859.04] not the stages we're talking about now
[2857.60 - 2861.12] we're in the stage of stage four
[2859.04 - 2863.84] epstein-barr we're talking about that
[2861.12 - 2865.52] okay the issues that result from the
[2863.84 - 2867.44] this viral inflammation can include
[2865.52 - 2869.92] muscle pain joint pain painful
[2867.44 - 2871.20] tender points back pain tingles and
[2869.92 - 2873.92] numbness hands and feet
[2871.20 - 2875.44] jerking and spasms you guys ever
[2873.92 - 2878.48] experienced any of that
[2875.44 - 2881.28] right migraines
[2878.48 - 2882.08] popping sound buzzing humming ringing in
[2881.28 - 2885.68] the ears
[2882.08 - 2886.32] tinnitus eye floaters insomnia dizziness
[2885.68 - 2889.60] fatigue
[2886.32 - 2892.16] unrestful sleep night sweats guys
[2889.60 - 2892.16] any of that
[2893.20 - 2896.80] okay chronic fatigue syndrome
[2895.04 - 2898.88] fibromyalgia ra
[2896.80 - 2900.56] all of which are collections of symptoms
[2898.88 - 2901.76] that the medical communities admit they
[2900.56 - 2903.68] don't understand
[2901.76 - 2905.20] and have no cure in such cases the
[2903.68 - 2905.84] patients are given inappropriate
[2905.20 - 2907.28] treatments
[2905.84 - 2909.52] that don't begin to address the real
[2907.28 - 2911.60] culprit because these mystery illnesses
[2909.52 - 2913.68] are stage four epstein-barr
[2911.60 - 2915.52] so this is the book new edition medical

[3038.24 - 3043.60] and i got some lettuce right here
[3041.76 - 3045.76] so these are the banana lettuce boats
[3043.60 - 3047.52] okay i'm gonna grab the bigger pieces i
[3045.76 - 3051.60] got some great pieces
[3047.52 - 3054.64] um that's a nice one right here
[3051.60 - 3059.04] i'm gonna do two pieces of lettuce per
[3054.64 - 3059.04] banana boat so we'll do that
[3061.60 - 3065.92] you guys the thing is with this blood
[3063.84 - 3069.44] draw problem right
[3065.92 - 3071.60] is i'm making a big deal out of this
[3069.44 - 3073.36] but for a reason i can't tell you how
[3071.60 - 3074.56] many people were wasted through the
[3073.36 - 3076.88] process of their
[3074.56 - 3078.72] of their healing journey struggled in
[3076.88 - 3081.28] the worst ways because of it
[3078.72 - 3082.40] even lost their lives complicated their
[3081.28 - 3084.24] illnesses
[3082.40 - 3086.08] i've mentioned the blood draw problem on
[3084.24 - 3088.40] and off over the years i thought people
[3086.08 - 3090.56] would pick up on it
[3088.40 - 3092.08] and they didn't and i was like well what
[3090.56 - 3095.44] am i gonna do you know
[3092.08 - 3099.28] it's like i have to make it president
[3095.44 - 3102.32] i have to make it number one right now
[3099.28 - 3105.12] until everybody knows you know and
[3102.32 - 3106.40] and and has a way to protect themselves
[3105.12 - 3108.16] because
[3106.40 - 3109.76] and even hearing this or hearing the
[3108.16 - 3111.68] podcast episode there's a chance you'll
[3109.76 - 3113.28] still be in the doctor's office
[3111.68 - 3114.72] or wherever and they're just going to
[3113.28 - 3116.16] suck the life out of you with all that
[3114.72 - 3117.44] blood knock your immune system down
[3116.16 - 3119.12] you're just going to be like oh what
[3117.44 - 3120.64] what just happened and
[3119.12 - 3123.20] and then things worse and worse and
[3120.64 - 3125.84] worse and but if you really focus and
[3123.20 - 3128.08] and listen to that episode spend some
[3125.84 - 3131.44] time with it
[3128.08 - 3134.08] you know it's it's it's just it's really
[3131.44 - 3134.08] important so
[3134.56 - 3138.64] so i'm making three right here is i'm
[3137.52 - 3141.76] gonna do i'm gonna make three
[3138.64 - 3145.12] banana boats right here now
[3141.76 - 3147.04] three bananas calls for
[3145.12 - 3152.16] more than three but that's three so i'm
[3147.04 - 3156.16] gonna make that
[3152.16 - 3158.40] so i'm going to make a date sauce right
[3156.16 - 3158.40] now
[3159.44 - 3162.88] i got some dates right here
[3163.68 - 3166.88] you got to take the pits out of the
[3164.96 - 3169.84] dates if you don't
[3166.88 - 3169.84] you can get in trouble
[3170.16 - 3173.36] um because you don't want these pits
[3172.24 - 3175.36] from a date
[3173.36 - 3177.36] i've said this like a ton of times said
[3175.36 - 3178.96] this a lot of times i know hundreds of
[3177.36 - 3180.48] times but people still leave pits in
[3178.96 - 3182.32] them by accident
[3180.48 - 3184.64] and they end up like end up getting in
[3182.32 - 3184.64] trouble
[3185.68 - 3189.60] so what do we do one blood test at a
[3188.40 - 3191.84] time
[3189.60 - 3193.20] okay if you listen to the podcast i give
[3191.84 - 3195.36] you a couple little tips but you got to
[3193.20 - 3199.60] hear the episode really okay
[3195.36 - 3201.84] it's important um
[3199.60 - 3203.68] you have the option of asking for half
[3201.84 - 3205.92] tubes filled
[3203.68 - 3206.88] so if the doctor was planning on doing
[3205.92 - 3209.92] seven full
[3206.88 - 3212.16] tubes you go with seven half you just
[3209.92 - 3214.08] ask them for seven half tubes
[3212.16 - 3215.36] that's what i i tell family and friends
[3214.08 - 3216.72] you can do whatever you want you can
[3215.36 - 3217.76] listen to your doctor of course they
[3216.72 - 3219.52] want seven tubes
[3217.76 - 3220.80] that that's you and your doctor i'm just
[3219.52 - 3222.24] telling you what i offer friends and
[3220.80 - 3225.68] family right
[3222.24 - 3227.28] and um and or what i would do if i ever
[3225.68 - 3228.48] needed blood work so i made some date
[3227.28 - 3230.64] sauce right there
[3228.48 - 3233.12] i'm making date sauce i mean so let's
[3230.64 - 3236.32] get a little bit of water in here
[3233.12 - 3240.32] about a tablespoon of water okay
[3236.32 - 3241.92] and i'm gonna add some lemon too
[3240.32 - 3243.28] so that's one thing you can do the other
[3241.92 - 3244.96] thing is just ask for your doctor to
[3243.28 - 3247.20] break up the tests
[3244.96 - 3248.80] break them up because that's a good way
[3247.20 - 3251.12] of handling it as well it's like
[3248.80 - 3252.80] how about if i just do the metabolic
[3251.12 - 3253.44] panel on the thyroid panel how about if
[3252.80 - 3255.12] i just do
[3253.44 - 3257.60] you know an ana and i do this and i'll
[3255.12 - 3259.36] come back for the other stuff
[3257.60 - 3261.44] and that's another thing you can do
[3259.36 - 3263.28] right and you see you're going in there
[3261.44 - 3266.56] doing more
[3263.28 - 3269.60] meaning meaning more visits and less
[3266.56 - 3270.08] blood taken at once right it can make or
[3269.60 - 3272.80] break
[3270.08 - 3274.08] somebody's healing process it could it
[3272.80 - 3277.68] the blood draws
[3274.08 - 3278.80] destroy healing processes i've seen it
[3277.68 - 3282.00] destroy
[3278.80 - 3284.80] healing processes like for real like
[3282.00 - 3284.80] that should be good
[3287.12 - 3295.04] so um add one more date in here
[3291.60 - 3295.04] it's the date sauce right here
[3295.12 - 3297.44] and
[3299.84 - 3304.48] i mean think about it think about having
[3301.84 - 3308.16] lyme disease right
[3304.48 - 3308.16] think about having lyme disease okay
[3308.48 - 3311.92] and you've been suffering for a long
[3309.92 - 3312.96] time been seeing different specialists
[3311.92 - 3320.56] and doctors
[3312.96 - 3322.80] they're drawing a lot of blood right
[3320.56 - 3322.80] and
[3325.44 - 3329.76] and you're losing a lot of blood i might
[3328.32 - 3332.88] not have put enough water in there
[3329.76 - 3335.84] i added a little extra date
[3332.88 - 3335.84] um
[3336.88 - 3339.92] i like the food processor for this is
[3338.96 - 3342.32] what i like
[3339.92 - 3344.40] i'm gonna add a little touch more water
[3342.32 - 3346.24] because i didn't add much at all
[3344.40 - 3347.76] so you can play with this and just make
[3346.24 - 3349.60] it right
[3347.76 - 3351.20] the recipe is really spot on but i'm
[3349.60 - 3353.52] kind of like doing this on the fly a
[3351.20 - 3353.52] little bit
[3354.56 - 3357.04] there you go
[3360.64 - 3364.64] let that kind of go around so you know
[3362.56 - 3365.76] you got lyme disease or not lyme disease
[3364.64 - 3367.76] you're just suffering with any kind of
[3365.76 - 3368.80] chronic fatigue or any kind of illness
[3367.76 - 3370.00] and you're just going through a really
[3368.80 - 3371.60] hard time
[3370.00 - 3373.84] and they're just taking more blood
[3371.60 - 3376.32] taking more blood taking more blood
[3373.84 - 3379.60] and that's how we get in trouble we lose
[3376.32 - 3382.96] our immune systems in the process
[3379.60 - 3382.96] add a little bit more water
[3386.48 - 3391.84] these dates are definitely really yummy
[3389.12 - 3391.84] by the way
[3392.16 - 3396.32] are you guys eating dates at all
[3393.76 - 3404.40] [Music]
[3396.32 - 3418.88] you love dates i saw that
[3404.40 - 3420.56] blending up the date sauce
[3418.88 - 3422.32] so when you get a chance listen to the
[3420.56 - 3425.36] episode
[3422.32 - 3427.20] it can really save a life
[3425.36 - 3429.44] the thing is is that they get you slow
[3427.20 - 3430.96] so you don't know it's happening
[3429.44 - 3433.04] see that's the other thing too the
[3430.96 - 3436.08] mistake they've made
[3433.04 - 3436.88] is so bad the mistake they've made is so
[3436.08 - 3439.84] bad
[3436.88 - 3441.04] that it sneaks up on you right it's a
[3439.84 - 3444.80] slow
[3441.04 - 3447.04] slow process
[3444.80 - 3448.56] of losing your immune system you just
[3447.04 - 3451.04] never know you're in it
[3448.56 - 3452.40] it could take years as they deplete you
[3451.04 - 3454.00] pull your white count out as
[3452.40 - 3455.36] things get better and then you're doing
[3454.00 - 3456.40] things as things get worse and then
[3455.36 - 3457.60] you're doing things to try to get
[3456.40 - 3460.56] yourself better so
[3457.60 - 3462.72] that's kind of going against it right so
[3460.56 - 3464.64] they're trying to bleed you to death
[3462.72 - 3466.88] whether they know it or not right
[3464.64 - 3469.12] they're trying to blood let you to death
[3466.88 - 3470.72] but it's happening slower because you're
[3469.12 - 3472.32] doing also good things well you're
[3470.72 - 3473.92] taking these supplements here you're
[3472.32 - 3474.96] talking to this other nutritionist here
[3473.92 - 3476.32] you're eating a little better you're
[3474.96 - 3478.08] drinking more water
[3476.32 - 3480.24] maybe you do some juices whatever it is
[3478.08 - 3481.92] you're doing that people do out there
[3480.24 - 3483.76] you're staying away from fast food
[3481.92 - 3484.48] greasy food so you're actually kind of
[3483.76 - 3486.64] like
[3484.48 - 3488.16] about trying to balance the scale while
[3486.64 - 3489.28] they're sucking the life out of you with
[3488.16 - 3490.96] the blood work right
[3489.28 - 3492.64] see how it works taking all that blood
[3490.96 - 3494.48] that they don't need to take
[3492.64 - 3496.56] but there comes a time where just
[3494.48 - 3498.64] practice it just takes you out
[3496.56 - 3499.92] it takes a lot of people out really
[3498.64 - 3502.08] really
[3499.92 - 3504.40] the way it does okay so i got some date
[3502.08 - 3506.96] sauce i'm putting a little date sauce
[3504.40 - 3509.44] drizzling a little bit on here on the
[3506.96 - 3509.44] banana
[3510.08 - 3513.44] so um
[3515.28 - 3518.32] a little bit on the banana boat so this
[3517.04 - 3520.24] is the date sauce
[3518.32 - 3521.60] it's a little bit of lemon with date god
[3520.24 - 3524.24] it's so good it's just
[3521.60 - 3526.00] it's so crazy good right you can put as
[3524.24 - 3529.04] much as you want on here i mean
[3526.00 - 3530.00] i i mean look you can make it your
[3529.04 - 3531.76] favorite way the one
[3530.00 - 3533.20] thing about mackel meat recipes if you
[3531.76 - 3534.56] need to adjust it or something
[3533.20 - 3535.84] and i'm going to add some raisins i
[3534.56 - 3536.96] don't know if you guys are doing raisins
[3535.84 - 3539.44] at all
[3536.96 - 3540.80] it's an option okay and i'm going to
[3539.44 - 3543.84] give you some other options
[3540.80 - 3544.64] too i'm going to put some raisins on the
[3543.84 - 3547.36] banana
[3544.64 - 3549.12] right here couple are just falling on
[3547.36 - 3553.60] the lettuce but that's just
[3549.12 - 3556.80] the natural process of having fun right
[3553.60 - 3559.84] this is great for kids keep in mind
[3556.80 - 3562.64] this is great for grandchildren
[3559.84 - 3563.20] it's great for children your children
[3562.64 - 3565.92] and
[3563.20 - 3567.44] so putting a few raisins on here this is
[3565.92 - 3572.96] for adults too
[3567.44 - 3576.88] i love this and
[3572.96 - 3578.08] right so some dates now
[3576.88 - 3579.92] i'll tell you what i love about this i'm
[3578.08 - 3581.76] going to put a little cinnamon
[3579.92 - 3584.16] if that's okay for you guys with you
[3581.76 - 3587.68] guys a little bit of cinnamon
[3584.16 - 3589.04] but actually cinnamon's optional and
[3587.68 - 3592.08] cayenne's optional so i'm probably gonna
[3589.04 - 3596.00] put a little cayenne on mine in a minute
[3592.08 - 3598.64] so um what i love about this
[3596.00 - 3601.52] is that you got the mineral salts from
[3598.64 - 3602.88] the lettuce right
[3601.52 - 3604.96] you got the mineral salts those are the
[3602.88 - 3606.32] trace mineral salts they're critical for
[3604.96 - 3608.48] the brain
[3606.32 - 3610.16] and strengthen your blood system that's
[3608.48 - 3611.92] the whole thing too right
[3610.16 - 3614.16] and your bloodstream but here's the
[3611.92 - 3616.08] thing too you got the glucose and you
[3614.16 - 3617.04] got other electrolytes from here you got
[3616.08 - 3618.56] the glucose
[3617.04 - 3620.32] from the banana you got the potassium
[3618.56 - 3623.12] from the banana potassium's
[3620.32 - 3624.64] that's a critical electrolyte mineral so
[3623.12 - 3626.88] you got that going on
[3624.64 - 3628.64] and then you got the raisins look i know
[3626.88 - 3630.96] a lot of people like what foods do i eat
[3628.64 - 3632.40] with low iron raisins are high in iron
[3630.96 - 3633.28] okay so that's one right there if you're
[3632.40 - 3635.92] worried
[3633.28 - 3637.84] but they're higher in iron but the point
[3635.92 - 3639.04] is raisins are also a medicine that's a
[3637.84 - 3642.32] medicinal
[3639.04 - 3644.48] grapes are medicinal that's medicine
[3642.32 - 3646.00] so this is a really healthy snack and it
[3644.48 - 3648.48] tastes incredible and then you got the
[3646.00 - 3650.08] lemon with all the calcium in the lemon
[3648.48 - 3652.16] so you got that all the calcium and the
[3650.08 - 3653.84] lemon that's another thing
[3652.16 - 3656.40] jane tedras says just listen to the
[3653.84 - 3658.72] blood draw podcast amazing incredible
