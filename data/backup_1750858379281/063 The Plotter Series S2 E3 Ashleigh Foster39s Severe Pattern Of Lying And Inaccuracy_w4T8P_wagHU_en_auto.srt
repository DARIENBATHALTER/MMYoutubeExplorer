The Following episode is part of a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,640
series dedicated to exposing an

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,559
organized hateful group that has been on

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,759
a Relentless pursuit to destroy the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,719
medical medium community and that has

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
been attacking bullying harassing and

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,320
preying upon the chronically ill joining

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,920
me in this series is a guest named Amber

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,920
bakaro she's an alternative medicine

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,000
practitioner who became a whistleblower

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
in action when they tried to recruit her

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
to join them last year Amber caught the

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,399
main members of this group on legally

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,879
recorded calls describing their

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,640
premeditated multi-step plan to create a

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,520
quote post-medical medium era by feeding

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,559
false stories and claims about me and

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,559
about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,320
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,479
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,439
Netflix that would bring Fame and other

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,600
benefits to them now known infamously

25
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,840
instead for their malicious plot that

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,000
was caught on recording and exposed we

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,079
refer to this hateful group as the

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,960
plotters their entire smear campaign is

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,240
spearheaded by one woman who comes from

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,920
an extremely wealthy family didn't get

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,840
what she wanted from me years ago and is

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,759
now seeking Rev venge she's made it her

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,720
mission to gather a bunch of plotters

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,520
with ulterior motives and aess to grind

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,159
including competitors in the health

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,119
industry to try to frame medical medium

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,000
and take down the community what this

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,960
organized hateful group has done is

health industry as you'll see it's also

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
one of the biggest instances of

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,600
capturing corruption within the

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,600

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,799
harmed by what they have done the record

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,799
needs to be set straight and they need

69
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,280
to be called out for what they've done

70
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,400
and are still doing the medical medium

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,879
Community does not deserve to be

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,640
attacked like this and we are going to

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,870
set the record straight as many times as

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,469
we need to

75
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,469
[Music]

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,840
all along Ashley Foster has had ulterior

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,959
motives all along Ashley Foster has been

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,400
wrong all along Ashley Foster has been

79
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,959
lying Ashley's original story about

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Stephanie included the claim that

81
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,920
Anthony never told Stephanie to see a

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,159
doctor we've proven that wrong with

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,159
evidence even before we released the

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,040
evidence Ashley was publicly corrected

85
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,439
on this claim Years Ago by the husband

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,799
of one of Stephanie's friends this

87
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,560
husband was actually around for what

88
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,200
happened with Stephanie while Ashley was

89
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,439
not after being publicly corrected

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,040
Ashley pivoted and moved forward with a

91
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:20,440
new manufactured story line the new

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,280
Stephanie story became well okay he told

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,880
her to go to the doctor I guess but it

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,080
wasn't until the end after it was too

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,919
late we've proven that wrong with

96
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
evidence Ashley claimed that that

97
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,080
Stephanie discovered her breast lump

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,880
while she was staying nights with Ashley

99
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,280
in

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,400
2016 we've proven that wrong with

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,919
evidence Stephanie did not develop the

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,000
breast lump until a whole year later in

103
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,440
2017 Ashley then claimed that Anthony in

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,080
2016 had told Stephanie that her breast

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
lump would never become cancerous we've

106
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
proven that very wrong with evidence

107
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,120
that is not possible because the breast

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,479
lump that was discovered in 2017 did not

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,199
exist in 2016

110
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,360
Ashley's story was

111
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,639
artificial Ashley also claimed that

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Anthony told Stephanie that she had

113
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,000
heard her back in yoga but that

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
Stephanie told Ashley that she didn't

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,479
remember hurting it in yoga we've proven

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,360
that wrong with evidence Ashley said

117
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,160
that Anthony's message to Stephanie was

118
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,039
to just lie still on the floor we've

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,479
proven that wrong with evidence Ashley

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,360
claimed that Stephanie had done

121
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,280
everything Anthony ever told her to do

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,120
we've proven that wrong with evidence

123
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,680
that's seven major falsities that Ashley

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,319
was proven wrong on last year seven

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
major falsities that were designed to

126
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,360
tarnish Anthony's reputation and to

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,199
scare people away from applying medical

128
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,919
medium information to heal seven major

129
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,680
falsities that harmed many people's real

130
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,000
lives seven major falsities that Ashley

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,960
needs to be held accountable for among

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
all of the other falsities and lies that

133
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,160
have been produced by her since this is

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,479
the false story that Ashley took the

135
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,680
vanity fair when the journalist Dan

136
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,919
Adler reached out to me regarding the

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,680
hit piece she had him working on I was

138
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:12,120
sent a list of hundreds of questions the

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,440
questions that were asked line up and

140
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,319
coordinate exactly with Ashley's

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,800
original false Stephy story from 2020 we

142
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,520
are going to be reading off those

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,800
questions in an upcoming episode Vanity

144
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,840
Fair manipulated material and got so

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,680
many things wrong in the story they

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,720
published and that is going to be

147
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,479
thoroughly exposed in this series but

148
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,599
there's a reason why even Vanity Fair

149
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,639
would not publish these falsities from

150
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,759
Ashley that Ashley wanted them to the

151
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,520
plotters have since expressed dismay

152
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,520
with Vanity Fair by stating that the

153
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,800
article only quote skim the surface the

154
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,319
article is a lie it just isn't as big of

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,919
a lie as they wanted it to

156
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,599
be we held back on a lot last time

157
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,240
around with these podcasts to give

158
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
Ashley an opportunity to do the right

159
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,360
thing and at the very least just stop

160
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,599
lying and spreading

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,520
misinformation not only has Ashley not

162
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,160
taken any accountability for the major

163
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,360
falsi she's been proven wrong on but

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,000
rather she has since continued on with

165
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,879
her deranged plot she's pivoted she's

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,440
created new false narratives and she's

167
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,560
manufactured and spread an unimaginable

168
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,599
number of New Lies I suspect that

169
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,879
another motive of Ashley's now is to try

170
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,919
to cover her tracks because we exposed

171
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,080
in a large scale that her original story

172
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,280
about Stephanie was fabricated and that

173
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,599
she was lying from the very beginning we

174
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,400
have also only just begun to publicize

175
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,840
the evidence of the true corruption that

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,720
took place in the process of Ashley and

177
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,240
the other plotters pushing their false

178
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,960
storyline onto Vanity Fair having to

179
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,000
hammer it into the head of the

180
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,479
journalist and having to threaten him to

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,039
get him to publish it yes you heard that

182
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,479
right if you're new to the series it's

183
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,479
all on recorded calls and there's a lot

184
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,440
more that's coming Ashley probably feels

185
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,879
like she has to keep going and trying to

186
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,960
come up with more lies and stories and

187
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
trying to drum up fake controversy to

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,960
keep up the facade so that she doesn't

189
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,360
look like the liar that she is but being

190
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,080
dishonest and manipulative can only ever

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,680
get you so far we are going to be

192
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,120
exposing all of it it's all coming out

193
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,319
now Ashley's pattern is that when she

194
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,000
gets proven wrong she pivots to other

195
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,479
topics and she deflects it's a tactic

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
meant to distract everyone who's listen

197
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,680
listening to her by throwing more

198
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
seemingly inflammatory false information

199
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,200
about Anthony at them to divert their

200
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,719
attention away from the fact that their

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,680
leader Ashley was proven wrong and is

202
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,680
lying so I implore anyone who's left out

203
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,160
there still taking Ashley seriously in

204
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,839
any way to ask themselves this if Ashley

205
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,399
is so principled about honesty and the

206
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,959
truth as she so claims then why hasn't

207
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,399
she addressed any one of these seven

208
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,480
major things that she spread online that

209
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,440
she brought to the media and that she

210
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,000
got so blatantly and provably wrong I

211
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
will let you sit with

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,680
that one of Ashley's true obsessions is

213
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,519
repeatedly declaring how perfectly

214
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,360
honest and morally Superior she is at

215
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,200
the same time as she incessantly calls

216
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,560
Anthony a liar sometimes multiple times

217
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,480
per day it seems like Ashley thinks if

218
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,880
she just repeats the words and accuses

219
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,320
him enough times that people will submit

220
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,040
and believe her regard L of how much the

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
substance of her arguments either makes

222
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,000
no sense at all or is just verifiably

223
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,000
wrong that is the definition of true

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,160
brainwashing and

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
indoctrination after our podcast came

226
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,120
out that exposed her and the other

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,480
individuals involved with this plot

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,160
using their own words on recording

229
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,880
Ashley really ramped up this behavior

230
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,000
for example on April 20th of 2023 Ashley

231
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,959
changed her Instagram bio to

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,040
read in case anyone comes looking for

233
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:08,399
information about mm/ Amber frauds and

234
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Liars of course she now attacks and

235
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,240
targets me as well because I am the one

236
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,519
who exposed her and her friends using

237
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,519
their own words on recordings around the

238
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,560
same time Ashley posted the following

239
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,839
comment and then deleted it along with

240
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,399
the post that was attached to it shortly

241
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,320
after

242
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:32,360
period I will die on this hill if some

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,560
someone literally pointed a gun at me

244
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,320
and asked me to say something other than

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,800
the truth I am telling I would not do it

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,800
if I don't have my Integrity I have

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,800
nothing when asked by a commenter do you

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,279
seriously believe your own

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,440
Ashley

250
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,399
replied I believe fully and the truth of

251
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:02,839
what I'm saying

252
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:06,079
yes and on May 5th of 2023 Ashley posted

253
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,240
this when Anthony started spewing more

254
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,279
of his dark lies on his wacky and

255
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,519
idiotic podcast because of the impending

256
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,480
Vanity Fair article I realized just how

257
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:22,040
confused and lost people would

258
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,240
be Ashley has yet to produce a single

259
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,200
piece of legitimate evidence that

260
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,399
Anthony or I have lied about a single

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,079
thing she's only just to spin ridiculous

262
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,480
false stories get things wrong spread

263
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,800
ridiculous rumors and other plotters who

264
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,839
might think that they've got something

265
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,880
with PO on social media they are very

266
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,760
wrong and that will all be exposed in

267
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
due time meanwhile Ashley and her

268
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,480
hateful group continue to ignore the

269
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,800
fact that Ashley was proven wrong on

270
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,720
these seven major falsities and more

271
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,920
with evidence after the podcast came out

272
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
last year Ashley went on a whole Rampage

273
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,160
about lying as she tried to deflect

274
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,079
attention away from that in that Rampage

275
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Ashley used a well-known true story

276
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,360
about the experiences of a family that

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,480
saved the lives of an estimated 800 Jews

278
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,279
and other refugees during the Holocaust

279
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Ashley used the story to try to make a

280
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,920
ludicrous point about lying and in the

281
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,720
process of doing so Ashley ironically

282
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,800
got no less than 18 facts wrong she

283
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,079
expressed extremely offensive viewpoints

284
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,920
regarding the Holocaust she disgraced

285
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,800
the names of honorary women who risked

286
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,720
their lives to save others during World

287
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,399
War II too and Ashley provided a perfect

288
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,920
example that everyone can verify of just

289
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,240
How Deeply she manipulates butchers and

290
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,199
twist the story she tells to serve her

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,959
own agenda we are going to read off what

292
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,240
Ashley posted and then I'm going to

293
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,079
unpack all of the 18 things that she got

294
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,760
wrong one by one almost every single

295
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,800
sentence of Ashley's entire series is

296
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,920
wrong in some way the story of the ten

297
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,279
booom family was recounted in a book

298
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
called The Hiding Place written by Corey

299
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,440
ten booom I read it cover to cover

300
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
myself and anyone out there can use this

301
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,880
book to independently fact check

302
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,760
Ashley's false information for

303
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,320
themselves I encourage you to do so for

304
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,839
context here's some background on the

305
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,120
ten booom family from the official

306
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,480
website of the museum dedicated to

307
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,440
preserving its historical Legacy it says

308
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,120
during the second world war the tboom

309
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,040
home became a refuge a hiding place for

310
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,800
fugitives and those hunted by the Nazis

311
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,079
by protecting these people Casper and

312
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
his daughter daughters Betsy and Corey

313
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,880
risked their lives this non-violent

314
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,519
resistance against the Nazi oppressors

315
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,760
was the ten boom's way of living out

316
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,920
their Christian faith during 1943 and

317
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,880
into 1944 there were usually five to six

318
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,320
people illegally living in the tboom

319
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,440
home some of whom were Jews and other

320
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
members of the Dutch underground

321
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,560
additional refugees would stay with the

322
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
tenb Booms for a few hours or a few days

323
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,600
until another safe house could be

324
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
located for them through these

325
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,040
activities the tboom family and their

326
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,399
many friends and co-workers of the bay

327
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,399
group saved the lives of an estimated

328
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,360
800 Jews and other

329
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,440
refugees in July of last year Ashley

330
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,240
posted the following

331
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,759
series okay question do you believe that

332
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,759
sometimes lying to them is in people's

333
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,519
best

334
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:30,440
interest I am a lying is never the right

335
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:34,920
choice person no matter what what I want

336
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:38,199
to share the story that convicted me of

337
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,279
this Betsy 10 boom was personally

338
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:45,480
convicted about honesty she and her

339
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,120
family including Corey ten Boom H juw in

340
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,839
their house throughout World War II and

341
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,759
were eventually arrested Betsy died in

342
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,519
Raybrook concentration

343
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,440
camp okay already we have falsity number

344
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,440
one it was Betsy's sister nollie and

345
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,480
nollie's daughter cocky who were

346
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
convicted about honesty and struggled

347
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,720
with the concept of telling lies in

348
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,680
order to save Jewish life not Betsy

349
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
Betsy was clear in her stance that under

350
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
the circumstances of the Nazi regime it

351
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,440
was the right thing to do to lie when

352
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,160
necessary for the purposes of saving

353
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,399
innocent lives Ashley also got the name

354
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,279
of the Concentration Camp wrong it's

355
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,759
Raven's Brook not Rave Brook she

356
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,519
continues

357
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,120
her sister Corey recounted a story of

358
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,120
Betsy's

359
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,440
honesty falsity number two again it was

360
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,759
not Betsy who was convicted about

361
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,680
honesty it was nollie and nollie's

362
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,680
daughter cocky and we've got falsity

363
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
number three here what Ashley is

364
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,399
referring to is not a singular story as

365
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,959
we go through the next several posts

366
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,279
you'll see that Ashley incorrectly

367
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,279
conflated multiple stories of separate

368
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,279
instances

369
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,399
once when German soldiers came to search

370
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,079
the house there was not time for the

371
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:13,360
Jews staying with them at that time to

372
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,360
fully hide so they hid under the kitchen

373
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,160
table we've got falsity number four the

374
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,199
incident involving the kitchen table in

375
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,319
fact occurred when there was a ria a ria

376
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,399
was a hostile raid during which the

377
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,519
Germans would come to forcibly enlist

378
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,279
young males in Holland to work in

379
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,000
munition factories the ten booom family

380
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,399
had the young men in their household

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
hide in a cellar with a trapo underneath

382
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,880
the kitchen table we've got falsity

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,240
number five the target of this raid was

384
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,880
not Jews to be placed in concentration

385
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,120
camps it was Dutch boys like Cory's

386
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,319
nephews that the Nazis wanted to enlist

387
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,560
to work in

388
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,160
factories and falsity number six during

389
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,800
the Ria Cory's nephews did not hide

390
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,040
underneath the table because they didn't

391
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,920
have enough time to quote fully hide

392
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,319
there was actually a Cellar underneath

393
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
the kitchen table that had been

394
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,000
specifically designed for hiding from

395
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,839
Nazi soldiers and other threats The

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
Cellar under the table is exactly where

397
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,280
the boys intended to

398
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,799
go a German soldier asked bety directly

399
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,439
are there any Jews hiding in this

400
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:26,240
house falsity number seven this is not

401
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,319
the question that was asked in fact the

402
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,120
German Soldier asked where are your

403
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,679
brothers do you have brothers how old

404
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,360
are they where are they now again in

405
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,400
this incident the soldiers were looking

406
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,000
for Dutch boys not Jews and falsity

407
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,080
number eight it was not Betsy who the

408
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,679
soldiers questioned it was cocky Betsy's

409
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,080
niece she said yes they are under the

410
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,080
kitchen

411
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,200
table falsity number nine this is not

412
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,880
what happened cocky not Betsy at first

413
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,799
tried to avoid the question next when

414
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,080
pressured cocky tells the soldiers that

415
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,360
two of her brothers were under the table

416
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,640
but then cocky burst out laughing which

417
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,320
tricked them the Nazis thought that she

418
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,840
was joking they got upset and they left

419
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,240
the soldiers did not capture any of the

420
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,559
boys her sister Cory was horrified and

421
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,120
crushed the couple was arrested and

422
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:30,760
taken away to a concentration camp Betsy

423
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,760
held fast to her conviction

424
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,200
this post unbelievably has four

425
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,919
falsities in one falsity number 10 this

426
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,720
is where Ashley began conflating

427
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,080
different incidents there was a

428
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,919
different event separate from the

429
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,760
kitchen table story in which one

430
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,919
individual woman not a couple was taken

431
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,080
away to the old Jewish theater in

432
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,640
Amsterdam the theater was a holding

433
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,919
place from which Jews could be

434
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,000
transported to concentration camps it

435
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,679
was not a concentration camp itself

436
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,559
falsity number 11 even in this other

437
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
incident that occurred at a completely

438
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,039
different time than the kitchen table

439
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,159
Story the Jewish woman who was captured

440
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,080
Analise was never taken to a

441
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,799
concentration camp falsity number 12

442
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,799
Corey was not horrified nor crushed by

443
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,919
the kitchen table incident the kitchen

444
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,120
table incident in fact made Corey start

445
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,120
to question the logic of nollie and her

446
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
daughter cocky who nearly gave her

447
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,440
brothers up to the Nazis Cory was

448
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,559
horrified and crushed by the theater

449
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,559
incident that resulted in Analise being

450
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,440
captured by the Nazis which happened

451
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,840
later

452
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,919
on falsity number 13 it was not Betsy

453
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,120
who held fast to her conviction it was

454
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,440
nollie and it was in a completely

455
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,360
different

456
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,840
incident less than a week later the

457
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,480
Concentration Camp those Jews were taken

458
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,559
to was liberated by Allied Forces and

459
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,320
everyone there was transported to

460
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,760
Freedom including the couple that had

461
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,640
been in

462
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,480
hiding and this one post from Ashley

463
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,039
shockingly has five falsities in it

464
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,039
falsity number 14 the kitchen table

465
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,360
incident was further than a week apart

466
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,600
from this event Ashley conflated

467
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,039
different incidents and got the timeline

468
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,159
wrong falsity number 15 in the other

469
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,320
story involving Analise it was not a

470
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,679
concentration camp that got liberated

471
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,840
Analise was being held in the old Jewish

472
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,440
theater and the theater was broken into

473
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,440
falsity number 16 the book does not

474
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,559
specify that the theater was broken into

475
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,200
by Allied Forces falsity number 17 not

476
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,440
everyone in the theater was transported

477
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,360
to Freedom only 40 Jews were rescued and

478
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
it was not a concentration camp that

479
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,400
they were coming

480
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,720
from and falsity number 18 Analise was

481
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,760
part of those 40 rescued Jews but she

482
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,720
was not part of a couple like Ashley

483
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,360
said

484
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,559
it is not our job to control the outcome

485
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,400
of our actions it is not our job to

486
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,360
decide how and when the truth should be

487
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,679
known we either believe in the immutable

488
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,679
importance of it or we don't

489
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,720
period here Ashley concludes her

490
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,120
mutilated version of The Story by

491
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
asserting her ridiculous Viewpoint that

492
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,120
anyone who lied to the Nazis to protect

493
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,120
and save the lives of Jews during the

494
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,000
Holocaust was morally wrong following

495
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,640
her asinine logic Ashley is saying that

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,080
she believes everyone should have been

497
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,440
honest with the na soldiers even if it

498
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,960
led to more Jews being Mass

499
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,840
murdered Ashley declares that one should

500
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,279
not be concerned with the consequences

501
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,679
of their actions even in the context of

502
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,039
the Holocaust and even if their actions

503
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,640
enabled

504
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,640
genocide truly

505
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,799
unbelievable people who lie are liars if

506
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,039
you're willing to lie about one thing

507
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,159
you might be willing to lie about

508
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,640
everything One Lie calls into question

509
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:14,559
the entirety of someone's

510
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,559
character what about two three 4 100

511
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,600
lies I mean how much more ironic could

512
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,520
this possibly be Ashley Foster told 18

513
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,320
falsities 18 falsities in a story she

514
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,279
tried to use to make an absurd point

515
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,200
about lying this series was all about

516
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,159
Ashley's Doctrine on always being honest

517
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,880
which Ashley claims she aderes to

518
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,200
perfectly and she's literally violating

519
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,640
that in the very story she used to try

520
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,480
to make that

521
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,159
point and then here Ashley even went as

522
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,279
far as to use derogatory terms to refer

523
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,080
to what the tboom family heroically did

524
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,279
to protect and save the lives of 800

525
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,200
innocent people from being murdered if

526
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,039
the members of the tboom family did not

527
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,679
lie to the Nazi oppress

528
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,200
who were committing atrocities those 800

529
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,520
Jews would have died and Ashley has the

530
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,840
audacity to call into question the

531
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,480
entirety of the ten booom family's

532
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,240
character who cares if people are being

533
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,960
tortured abused and murdered it's not

534
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,159
your job to worry at all about the

535
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,320
consequences of your actions what's

536
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,120
important according to Ashley is that

537
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,960
you try to prove your own superiority

538
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,559
like she's trying to do with this warped

539
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,840
story that she

540
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,520
invented this is not about promoting

541
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,400
lying it's about having sanity Ashley

542
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,840
could have used anything any other story

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,200
or anecdote or something else to express

544
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,320
herself and make the claim that she

545
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,760
doesn't believe in lying but to use this

546
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,320
story in this way let alone distorting

547
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,240
it with 18 falsities in the process to

548
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,840
say that when faced with Nazis asking

549
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
about Jews hiding in your home during

550
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,720
the Holocaust knowing that they are

551
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,960
going to be taken to a concentration

552
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,200
camp at Ashley saying that she would

553
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,840
give up the Jews it's a window into how

554
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Ashley thinks this is what we're dealing

555
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,240
with who in their right mind thinks like

556
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,120
this Ashley's entire false story about

557
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,039
Stephanie was built on her original

558
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,360
claim I never told Stephanie to see a

559
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,720
doctor and not once did Ashley ever

560
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,159
reach out to me or call me up and say

561
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,039
hey what's up did you tell Stephanie to

562
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,600
see a doctor but because she lied she

563
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,880
had a save face and stay with the lie

564
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,080
and that takes a certain kind of person

565
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,080
a person who doesn't want to admit a

566
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,799
huge mistake a person who doesn't want

567
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:46,360
to come clean and keeps going making

568
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,880
more huge false claims lies and mistakes

569
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,159
if anyone wants a window into Ashley's

570
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,120
mind it's this Holocaust story tell

571
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,960
dozens and dozens of lies and falsities

572
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,159
and then say how one should never tell a

573
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,440
lie

574
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,440
so much so that it's best to just call

575
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,480
out the Jews hiding underneath the table

576
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,480
to the Nazis you have the daughter of a

577
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,440
billionaire family that lies and tells

578
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,480
falsities and she's using this false

579
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,880
story about the Holocaust to try to give

580
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,679
you permission to not care about the

581
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,600
consequences of your actions this is the

582
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:26,399
entitlement of Ashley who doesn't care

583
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,880
about who gets harmed by a false story

584
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,440
she just wants her documentary she

585
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,279
doesn't care who's in the

586
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,360
way when Ashley's business proposals got

587
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,919
turned down by Anthony and her big

588
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,320
career dreams didn't work out the way

589
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,919
that she wanted them to Ashley set out

590
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,279
on this mission to tear Anthony down to

591
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,240
constantly take stabs at him to try to

592
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,200
blast him in the media to attack him to

593
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,919
put him and the entire medical medium

594
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,679
Community down to be little and demean

595
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,600
them to try to make them feel small and

596
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,480
there is no low that she will not stoop

597
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,880
to in her

598
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,880
Pursuit what makes Ashley's series on

599
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,760
lying even more of an absolute farce is

600
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,240
the fact that Ashley Gravely missed the

601
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,679
mark on what the actual ten booom story

602
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,120
portrays about lying which is very

603
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,360
different from the story that Ashley

604
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,240
seems to have made up in her head Betsy

605
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,799
and Corey tboom took on the role of

606
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,760
protecting and saving Jews they are the

607
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,919
heroes of the story their sister nollie

608
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,559
and nollie's daughter cocky are the ones

609
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,480
who were struggling with the concept of

610
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,960
lying not Betsy whom Ashley confused

611
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,279
them with throughout the story nollie's

612
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,240
family pointed out nollie's illogic

613
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:41,360
nollie was still doing lies with her

614
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,080
actions even if she wouldn't tell lies

615
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,679
from her lips with words and nalii

616
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
taught her daughter to think in the same

617
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,039
illogical

618
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,799
way for example to nollie as well as

619
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,000
cocky it was okay to partake in creating

620
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,559
the hiding place in the cellar under the

621
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,200
kitchen table for her sons to deceive

622
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,039
and hide from from German soldiers in

623
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,000
but when the soldiers asked cocky a

624
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,200
question she felt that she must tell the

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
truth from her lips even though it

626
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,080
nearly harmed her own brothers and then

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,880
cocky also burst out laughing during

628
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,640
this incident which made it seem like

629
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
she was joking about the boys being

630
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,720
under the table and that was not

631
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,640
truthful it was an inconsistency that

632
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,440
was directly addressed in the book

633
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,760
itself such as in the following excerpt

634
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,760
written by Cory tboom it says it was a

635
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,480
strange dinner party that evening

636
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,240
veering as it did from heartfelt

637
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,279
Thanksgiving to the nearest thing to a

638
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,840
bitter argument our closet family has

639
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,480
ever had nollie stuck by cocky insisting

640
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,919
she would have answered the same way God

641
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,919
honors truthtellah

642
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,600
uniform on

643
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,440
Katrine nonetheless Ashley goes on to

644
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,519
end her depraved series with the

645
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,600
following

646
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,480
quote choose your Leaders with wisdom

647
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,440
and

648
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:19,799
forethought to be led by a liar is to

649
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,799
ask to be told lies Octavia E

650
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:25,840
Butler 18 falsities later and on top of

651
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,360
the repulsive spin she put on a

652
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,240
holocaust story Ashley ALS also

653
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,519
disrespected the names of true heroes

654
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,679
Betsy and Cory tboom were incredible

655
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,320
honorable

656
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,679
leaders by demonizing the decisions

657
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,000
these women made under entirely evil

658
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,320
circumstances in order to save hundreds

659
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,960
of people's lives Ashley utterly

660
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,519
disgraces the tboom Legacy and all of

661
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,279
those who fought the absolutely

662
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,080
reprehensible acts of the Nazi regime

663
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,960
including the 6 million Jews who

664
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,200
perished during the

665
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,200
Holocaust and then of course what

666
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Ashley's inferring with all of this is

667
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,039
that I'm a liar and that she's not she's

668
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,000
saying that she's such an honest person

669
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,080
she wouldn't even lie to protect a Jew

670
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,440
during the Holocaust while she's telling

671
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:19,480
a story herself with 18 falsities in

672
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,960
it this is Ashley's pattern she accuses

673
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:26,799
people of what she's actually doing

674
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,200
Ashley lies Ashley tells false stories

675
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,600

verifiable lies and

693
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,320
falsities for someone who supposedly

694
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,279
feels so strongly about the truth that

695
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,480
she believes it's not even right to lie

696
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,880
to save a Jew's life during the

697
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,240
Holocaust for someone who claimed that

698
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,000
they a lying is never the right choice

699
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,720

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,640
second in addition to the immeasurable

706
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,159
number of falsities and Flatout lies

707
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,440
Ashley has continued to spew in the last

708
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,760
year like saying that her family doesn't

709
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,760
have a private jet or vacation homes

710
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,720
when they do and that she's never made

711
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,159
money off of Instagram when she has

712
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,880
Ashley also has a documented record of

713
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,440
instructing other people to lie and be

714
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,919
dishonest for her in fact I am one of

715
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,679
those people in my calls with the

716
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,200
plotters last year after they had

717
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,639
explained their plan to smear Anthony

718
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,360
and try to create a post-medical medium

719
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:22,200
era Ashley said this to

720
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,960
me

721
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,880
so I'm just grateful that you that

722
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,360
you're on that um that you're exploring

723
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,720
that now and and I hope that you'll

724
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,720
honor Robbie and Taylor's confidence

725
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,480
by by um by not sharing

726
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:49,200
with oh anything with Anthony until it's

727
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,720
the right time it's a little bit of a

728
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,320
it's a little bit of a d Dynamite like a

729
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,320
loaded situation right

730
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,480
now and Taylor said this to me as

731
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,720
well

732
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,559
sure can we hear that

733
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,960
again to make sure you wouldn't tell

734
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,360
Anthony I wanted to make sure you

735
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,559
wouldn't tell Anthony the plotters and

736
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,519
Ashley specifically wanted me to keep

737
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,960
everything they told me a secret from

738
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,159
Anthony if Anthony had reached out and

739
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,279
asked me what was going on Ashley's

740
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,200
expectation was that I was supposed to

741
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:29,240
lie to him Ashley apparently believes

742
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,679
it's never the right choice to lie not

743
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,840
under any circumstance no matter what

744
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,960
not even to save people's lives during

745
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,159
the

746
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,600
Holocaust except when Ashley wanted me

747
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,919
to lie for the benefit of her and her

748
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,799
friends that was somehow

749
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,679
okay on July 16th of 2018 a friend

750
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,559
texted Ashley and said by the way a pure

751
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,600
encapsulations order I placed went

752
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,159
missing and they are calling me but just

753
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,000
in case they accidentally call your

754
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,240
number that's why haha and Ashley

755
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,120
replied

756
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,840
okay just tell them I pleas the order

757
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,880
for you because I'm not supposed to let

758
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,880
people use my account

759
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,960
LOL so here Ashley is letting a friend

760
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,639
use her supplement purchasing account

761
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,360
and she's acknowledging that she's not

762
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:19,519
supposed to this is what Corey and Betsy

763
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,840
tboom from The Hiding Place story that

764
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,760
Ashley referenced would call doing a lie

765
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,799
then Ashley's also instructing her

766
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,200
friend in this text to lie about who

767
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,600
placed her supplement order as her

768
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,760
actions make very clear Ashley said she

769
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,039
is a lying is never the right choice

770
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
type of person only because that suited

771
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,880
her Narrative of the moment as that is

772
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,679
obviously not something Ashley actually

773
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,559
believes in or lives

774
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,840
by again we're not arguing for or

775
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,960
against the morality of lying here I'm

776
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,120
simply pointing out the absolutely

777
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,880
unhinged contradictions in Ashley's own

778
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,320
thinking writing speech and

779
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,679
behavior since the beginning of Ashley's

780
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,679
mission to smear Anthony Ashley has

781
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,360
attempted to shield and cover for her

782
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,399
falsities by saying that she's just

783
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,679
sharing her truth she's also tried to

784
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,639
infer credibility based on her purported

785
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,159
direct experience with Stephanie for a

786
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,760
short period of time in the comment

787
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,320
section of a post Ashley made on

788
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,800
February 11th of 2020 she said

789
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,679
this the reason I chose to share exactly

790
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,679
what I did about her story is because I

791
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,480
was there for that small part in physic

792
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,960
physically present with her so I felt

793
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,960
like something I could share

794
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,599
truthfully in this comment Ashley is

795
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,399
referring to the false timeline that she

796
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,040
also repeated later on in 2020 in which

797
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,599
Ashley stated that Stephanie had

798
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,320
discovered her breast lump while

799
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,399
Stephanie was staying with Ashley in

800
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,720
2016 as we've shared many times this is

801
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
incorrect the evidence clearly shows

802
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,760
that Stephanie discovered her breast

803
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,880
lump on March 6th of 2017 a whole year

804
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,680
year after the timeline of Ashley's fake

805
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,040
story Ashley was not with Stephanie when

806
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,079
Stephanie discovered her breast lump in

807
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,320
2017 as we discussed previously Ashley

808
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,880
admitted that she did not see Stephanie

809
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,599
once during the entire two years that

810
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,560
passed between the time that Stephanie

811
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,920
stayed in Ashley's home in 2016 and the

812
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,400
time that Stephanie passed away in

813
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,119
2018 Ashley did not visit Stephanie

814
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,480
during the time of her injury nor when

815
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,400
Stephanie was in the hospital Ashley's

816
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,520
even admitted that she barely kept in

817
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,000
communication with Stephanie at all

818
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,240
during the time of her injury on March

819
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,560
6th of 2020 she wrote

820
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,839
this stephani I didn't talk often during

821
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,720
her back

822
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,359
injury the truth is that Ashley was not

823
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,200
physically present for any single part

824
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,000
of Stephanie's entire Journey with her

825
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,160
breast lump her back injury her cancer

826
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,200
or her passing so not only is Ashley

827
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,079
devoid of facts but the single leg of

828
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
credibility she tried to stand on by

829
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,640
saying that she was physically present

830
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,640
for a small portion of what Stephanie

831
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,160
experienced with her breast lump is a

832
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,920
lie after the release of our first four

833
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,800
podcasts in which we presented a large

834
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,200
amount of evidence that disproved

835
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Ashley's false storylines Ashley got a

836
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,000
lot of push back for what she had done

837
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,119
and the falsities she was continuing to

838
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,800
try to spread in response to this push

839
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,800
back Ashley continued to Pedal the I'm

840
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,119
just sharing my truth narrative it's a

841
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,800
tactic to try to evade being held to an

842
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,480
objective standard of the truth rather

843
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,880
than presenting legitimate facts or

844
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,720
evidence Ashley constantly uses and

845
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,200
relies upon someone told me I was there

846
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,640
for it I experienced it personally or I

847
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,520
heard a rumor statements which cannot be

848
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,000
verified and of course can easily be

849
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,040
fabricated and even if it were a valid

850
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,280
pass that she's just sharing her truth

851
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,200
Ashley can't even get her truth straight

852
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,160
in all of Ashley's attempts to make

853
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,640
Anthony and medical medium information

854
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,880
look bad she's told numerous stories

855
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,200
multiple times in completely different

856
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,720
contradictory versions that cannot all

857
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,160
be true at the same time here is an

858
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,319
example of a storyline Ashley told four

859
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,720
different versions of on February 11th

860
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,760
of 2020 when Ashley first started

861
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,440
posting false information about what had

862
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,280
happened to Stephanie she got a

863
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,319
commenter who said I find this very hard

864
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,839
to believe and and Ashley

865
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:35,200
replied that's okay I understand I

866
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,480
worked really hard while writing this to

867
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,920
make sure everything I wrote was

868
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,640
absolutely true and not opinion the

869
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,640
truth is she was a close friend of his

870
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,560
for several years and had followed his

871
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,480
protocol more exactly than anyone else

872
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,640
I've ever met for that entire

873
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,640
time in this version Ashley's saying

874
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,160
that from her own perspective she

875
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,920
observed that Stephanie followed

876
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,280
Anthony's protocol more exactly than

877
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,400
anyone else she's ever met for that

878
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,000
entire

879
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,839
time those who actually understand

880
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,839
medical medium information know that

881
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,599
there is no one medical medium protocol

882
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:19,480
anyway so this is a problematic

883
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,960
statement in and of itself but then in

884
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,160
the second version of this same

885
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,560
statement Ashley says something similar

886
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,400
but adds to it on March 6th of 2020

887
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Ashley posted this

888
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:37,000
and allow me to be clear I have never

889
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,599
met to this day anyone who followed

890
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,079
Anthony's advice more closely than Steph

891
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,079
not even Anthony

892
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,400
himself she told this version now with

893
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,640
the addition of not even Anthony himself

894
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,160
in at least two different places which

895
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,560
is ridiculous because Ashley had no idea

896
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,240
what Anthony was eating or not eating as

897
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,000
they were not nearly as close as she

898
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,319
constantly tries to portray it to be in

899
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,480
the third version from May 5th of last

900
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:11,400
year she says something

901
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,720
different also I don't want to be rude

902
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,839
but you're patently wrong some of us

903
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,720
here have studied and applied his

904
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:23,079
information more carefully than even

905
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,599
Anthony himself that's something he told

906
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:25,599
Steph

907
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,240
once so now instead of Ashley making the

908
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,280
statement about Stephanie like she did

909
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,800
in the previous two versions she's

910
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,160
changed the subject of the story to some

911
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,720
of us here have applied the information

912
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,880
better than Anthony

913
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,920
himself Stephanie passed away in 2018

914
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,160
and again Ashley posted this version

915
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,240
last year

916
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,119
2023 does she mean by some of us here

917
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,680
that her and her co- plotters have

918
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,720
followed and applied medical medium

919
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,359
information better than Anthony that's

920
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,359
laughable and instead of this being an

921
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:02,640
observation from her own perspective

922
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,680
like it was in the previous two versions

923
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Ashley's changed it to this is something

924
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,880
Anthony told Stephanie

925
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,880
once in the fourth version Ashley says

926
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,359
this remember when Anthony claimed Steph

927
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:24,680
didn't follow his protocols well enough

928
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:27,319
what a lie from the pit of Hell Anthony

929
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,400
told me personally one time that step

930
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:32,720
followed his protocols even better than

931
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
he

932
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,200
did first of all because Ashley

933
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,160
literally gets everything wrong I have

934
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,520
to clear this up Anthony has never said

935
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
that Stephanie didn't follow his

936
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,440
protocols well enough absolutely never

937
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,160
said it in previous podcast episodes we

938
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,680
simply debunked Ashley's falsity that

939
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,240
Stephanie had followed medical medium

940
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,680
information to a te we used multiple

941
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,440
pieces of evidence to show that

942
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,839
Stephanie factually did not follow it to

943
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,520
a tea there was no implication made that

944
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,880
Stephanie should have done anything

945
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,920
better or differently in fact we played

946
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,200
an audio message from Stephanie in which

947
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,280
she had said that she knew that Anthony

948
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,800
wasn't a fan of the Dr Morse grape fast

949
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,520
that Stephanie said she was quote hooked

950
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,760
on doing but that she was doing them

951
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,359
anyway and that Anthony was not pushing

952
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,000
her to do medical medium instead anyone

953
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,680
can go back and listen to our previous

954
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,720
episodes to verify that Stephanie took

955
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,599
in lots of different modalities and

956
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,000
health approaches at times I would say

957
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,920
this is fine or that is fine because

958
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,440
Stephany was on her own path doing her

959
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,680
own raw food thing and as she said in

960
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,040
the audio she was already hooked on

961
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,359
certain things so I was supportive of

962
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,400
Stephanie doing what she wanted to do I

963
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,640
did not control Stephanie's decisions or

964
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,599
even try to instead I supported her in

965
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,560
any decision she made with things that

966
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:02,400
spoke to her even if it wasn't medical

967
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,280
medium they're trying to punish me for

968
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,440
not controlling Stephanie's wishes and

969
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,240
health choices and then they're also

970
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,920
trying to punish me and blame me for

971
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,800
supposedly controlling them this is very

972
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,440
abusive behavior on their

973
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,480
part Ashley said that Anthony's claim

974
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,359
was a lie from the pit of Hell when

975
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,640
Ashley fully made up the claim he never

976
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:29,079
said it what we did share on the podcast

977
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,640
was hard evidence from Stephanie herself

978
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,559
far from a lie and Ashley saying all of

979
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,200
this at the same time as she herself is

980
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,920
telling an actual lie as part of a story

981
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,079
she told four different contradictory

982
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,960
versions of in this fourth version of

983
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,960
the same story from Ashley about what

984
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,640
Stephanie was eating and doing instead

985
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,160
of the statement being an observation

986
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,920
from Ashley's own perspective or

987
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,640
something Anthony told Stephanie once

988
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,440
like Ashley said previously now she's

989
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,520
changed to Anthony told Ashley that

990
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Stephanie followed his protocols even

991
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,040
better than he did so which is it all of

992
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,839
these four story versions contradict

993
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,880
themselves and they cannot all be true

994
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,200
at the same time that is because Ashley

995
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,400
is lying and she can't even keep her own

996
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,839
madeup story

997
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,440
straight Ashley did not know what I was

998
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,079
eating I didn't speak to Ashley about

999
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,800
how I ate I didn't tell Ashley that

1000
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,040
Stephanie ate better than me I never

1001
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,640
talked to Ashley about Stephanie at all

1002
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,440
so it's not even possible I never told

1003
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,720
Stephanie that Stephanie eats better

1004
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,920
than me Ashley's just fabricating

1005
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,960
stories

1006
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,640
again furthermore Ashley has admitted

1007
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,000
that she isn't really that versed in

1008
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,240
medical medium information in a live

1009
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,640
stream she did in 2020 she said

1010
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,000
this all right will I read his new book

1011
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,760
I honestly haven't read like the last

1012
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,280
three probably if I'm being really

1013
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,359
honest she honestly hasn't read like the

1014
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,800
last three books this was in 2020 in

1015
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,440
reference to when the cleans to heal

1016
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,920
book was coming out so it was before

1017
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,599
medical medium revised and expanded and

1018
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,800
it was also before the brains saer books

1019
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,720
that means Ashley basically only

1020
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,880
supposedly read the first two out of

1021
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,119
what's now nine books Ashley didn't read

1022
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,920
thyroid healing Liver Rescue celery

1023
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,440
juice cleanse to heal Medical revised

1024
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,839
brainsaver 1 or brainsaver 2 Ashley has

1025
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,200
hardly read any medical medium material

1026
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:39,040
and it shows which makes her far from an

1027
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,319
expert on medical medium information so

1028
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,000
how would Ashley know that Stephanie was

1029
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,319
following medical medium information to

1030
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,240
the letter or not if Ashley doesn't even

1031
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:49,800
know medical medium

1032
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,720
information what's even more insane is

1033
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,920
that there are more examples of Ashley

1034
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,720
telling multiple completely different

1035
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,040
contradictory versions of the same story

1036
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,760
The One one I'm going to unpack now is

1037
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,200
one that Ashley has told nine different

1038
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,800
versions of would you trust someone who

1039
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,559
has nine different versions of the same

1040
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,920
story about something this one is jam

1041
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,839
packed with falsities and fiction so

1042
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,760
bear with us as we unload this pile of

1043
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,280
crap onto the public this is the

1044
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,520
infamous cat

1045
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,280
story Ashley's son was sick with a skin

1046
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,480
condition in 2018 he was a baby at the

1047
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,960
time and Ashley sought Anthony's help

1048
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,640
with it in 2019 a year later Ashley

1049
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,319
started publicly telling fake stories

1050
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,200
about this experience she's changed and

1051
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,280
adapted the story more and more with

1052
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,160
time in 2020 right after Ashley came out

1053
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,040
with her false story about Stephanie

1054
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,760
Ashley did a live stream and said that

1055
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,559
Anthony had gotten it wrong with her son

1056
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,119
because Anthony missed the fact that it

1057
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,520
was really a cat allergy that was behind

1058
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,839
his eczema

1059
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,680
outbreak this is a story that Ashley

1060
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,119
told me on my recorded calls with her as

1061
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,119
she was trying to convince me that

1062
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,280
Anthony is a liar it's a story that I

1063
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,839
later found out has been used many many

1064
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,920
times by Ashley to intentionally try to

1065
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,079
break people's trust and confidence in

1066
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,280
Anthony and in medical medium

1067
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,200
information most people who have turned

1068
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,640
against Anthony have heard it it's a

1069
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:23,800
story that Ashley is still telling to

1070
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:26,680
this day it's the cat story the cat

1071
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,599
story so as the real cat story was

1072
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,920
actually actually happening in real time

1073
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,000
in 2018 there is a documented record of

1074
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,079
Ashley telling the story correctly and

1075
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,040
consistently to four different people

1076
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,240
when Ashley's son was actively dealing

1077
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,760
with his eczema outbreak Ashley texted

1078
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,960
with Anthony Anthony's wife and two

1079
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,880
different friends about what was

1080
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,960
happening I have all the texts and these

1081
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,599
four truthful versions serve as a record

1082
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,520
for contrasting with all of the

1083
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,480
fabricated versions that Ashley has told

1084
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,920
since now since 2019 Ashley has told

1085
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,040
five false versions of the cat story

1086
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,520
that we are aware of and who knows how

1087
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,280
many other versions she's told that we

1088
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,440
haven't seen not only are these five

1089
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,920
versions false contradictory and

1090
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,960
different from the four truthful

1091
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,200
versions of the cat story from when it

1092
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,480
was happening in 2018 but they're also

1093
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,200
each different from each other and they

1094
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,440
contradict one another I'm going to

1095
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,440
first play one rendition of Ashley's

1096
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,960
fake version of the cat story which was

1097
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,599
told during her April 1 2020 live stream

1098
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,960
we are redacting the name of Ashley's

1099
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,559
son for his privacy so every time you

1100
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,280
hear a bleep throughout the series it's

1101
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,800
someone saying Ashley's son's name or in

1102
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,440
one instance the name of another one of

1103
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:45,480
Ashley's

1104
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,359
children in regards to it's interesting

1105
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,359
I feel like it's another thing that just

1106
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,520
stood out to me as concerning um when

1107
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:55,640
got really bad eczema of course Anthony

1108
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,800
and I were really close and I had

1109
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,520
followed medical medium approach

1110
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,960
approach during pregnancy and so it was

1111
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:05,280
like holy cow what is going on of course

1112
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:09,040
I called Anthony about it and um we

1113
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:12,200
talked he changed my diet a lot uh well

1114
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,359
not a lot but he was very clear about

1115
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,079
like you need to cut out almost all fat

1116
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,920
except avocado from your diet I was

1117
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,079
doing like more of the cashews and the

1118
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,079
nuts and seeds and stuff

1119
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,480
um and so I did I I took that out of my

1120
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,680
diet and um

1121
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,160
um and slowly started to get a little

1122
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,880
bit better over the course of the next

1123
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,119
six months until he finally healed but

1124
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,359
the actual turning point in his healing

1125
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,440
came when we went to Hawaii and realized

1126
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,400
that he was severely allergic to cats

1127
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,640
because he was doing really well and

1128
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,400
then we changed airbnbs to an Airbnb

1129
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,319
where there was a cat and he started

1130
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,000
breaking out an eczema again like the

1131
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:58,559
following morning just like full whole

1132
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,920
body

1133
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,880
hives um and so we realized oh he has a

1134
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,520
cat

1135
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,839
allergy um and that was causing like the

1136
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,920
bulk of the problem and so I just find

1137
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:13,480
it curious that in talking to Anthony

1138
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,000
like why wouldn't he have mentioned like

1139
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,160
yes you can make all these dietary

1140
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,599
changes but also the fact that you got a

1141
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:24,160
cat four weeks ago is probably the real

1142
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,079
problem so Ashley was breastfeeding her

1143
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,880
baby during this time and what she was

1144
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,079
eating had the the ability to impact her

1145
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,960
son through her breast milk Ashley

1146
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,040
saying here that she was doing nuts and

1147
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,240
seeds and that Anthony had told her to

1148
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,200
cut out almost all fat except avocado

1149
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,960
she's saying that when she did that her

1150
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,920
son's eczema started to improve

1151
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,000
gradually until it healed

1152
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,160
completely but that she on her own

1153
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,880
realized that the actual turning point

1154
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,079
was when they were in an Airbnb in

1155
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,920
Hawaii with a cat in it and her baby

1156
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,760
broke out in eczema again Ashley is

1157
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,040
saying that she realized that he was

1158
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,839
reacting due to a cat allergy that

1159
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,920
Anthony had missed sounds convincing

1160
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:06,599
right if Ashley had reached out to you

1161
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,960
on Instagram like she's doing to many

1162
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,440
people tried to recruit you into her

1163
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,000
hateful group and told you the story

1164
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,040
what would you think why didn't Anthony

1165
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,160
catch that it was a cat allergy he's

1166
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,079
supposed to be able to do that he should

1167
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,440
have known that it was a cat allergy

1168
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,880
he's obviously not who he says he is

1169
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,760
well here's the real story of what

1170
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,400
actually happened from Anthony's text

1171
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,440
thread we know that Ashley's baby

1172
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,760
started having an eczema Outbreak on

1173
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,920
June 19th of

1174
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,920
2018 and then there's a text thread

1175
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,880
between Ashley and a friend from when

1176
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,720
her son was dealing with his eczema in

1177
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,640
real time on June 28th of 2018 the

1178
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:52,160
friend texted Ashley and said hey honey

1179
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:55,839
how are you how's the rash Ashley

1180
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,960
replied hey BB doing good here gearing

1181
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:01,920
up to heads Dallas tomorrow it's still

1182
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,240
pretty bad but not getting worse I think

1183
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:09,559
it's actually starting to scab

1184
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,000
up the friend said a poor little Dallas

1185
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,720
will hopefully be

1186
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,240
nice Ashley sent a photo of her baby's

1187
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:19,200
eczema and said

1188
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,799
this I talked to Aunt and he said it's

1189
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,240
most likely the

1190
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:27,520
cat okay we have to pause here this is

1191
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,079
the Smoking Gun

1192
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,440
Ashley texted her friend saying that

1193
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,400
Anthony told her it's most likely the

1194
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,720
cat whereas in the 2020 version of the

1195
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,599
story Ashley said she herself discovered

1196
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,079
that the cat was causing her baby skin

1197
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,680
problems and that Anthony had missed it

1198
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:51,799
here it is again the 2020

1199
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,040
version um and so we realized oh he has

1200
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:55,640
a cat

1201
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,200
allergy um and that was causing like the

1202
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,440
bulk of the problem

1203
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,760
and so I just find it curious that in

1204
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,359
talking to Anthony like why wouldn't he

1205
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,799
have mentioned like yes you can make all

1206
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:08,160
these diary changes but also the fact

1207
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:10,920
that you got a cat four weeks ago is

1208
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,920
probably the real

1209
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:17,839
problem versus what actually happened

1210
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,079
according to Ashley's own text messages

1211
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:23,040
from

1212
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:26,839
2018 I talked to Aunt and he said it's

1213
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,799
most likely the cat

1214
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:32,480
Ashley Foster is a

1215
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:36,559
liar there you have it right out of the

1216
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,119
horse's mouth Ashley's own words proving

1217
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,920
that she

1218
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:44,200
lied now we can

1219
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:47,880
continue I talked to an and he said it's

1220
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,240
most likely the cat cat has been gone 4

1221
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,839
days but I'm sure there's still a lot

1222
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,720
here so Dallas might actually help it

1223
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:58,760
heal up further well I mean liver issues

1224
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,760
but the cat is you

1225
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,520
know the friend said a the poor baby so

1226
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,160
did you give the cat away or just having

1227
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,599
a break from it and Ashley

1228
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,640
replied we gave it to our friends who

1229
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:16,200
wanted it really badly I really love

1230
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,720
having a pet around but they create so

1231
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,160
much mess and our home just feels so

1232
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,920
clean

1233
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,839
now Ashley's saying in these text

1234
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,240
messages that Anthony told her that her

1235
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:33,839
son's eczema outbreak was due to liver

1236
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,319
issues plus the cat Ashley also says

1237
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:39,799
that they gave the cat away on June 24th

1238
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:43,280
of 2018 this is 4 months before the

1239
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:45,760
Hawaii Retreat remember that in the fake

1240
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,839
story she told in 2020 Ashley said it

1241
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,880
wasn't until the Hawaii Retreat that she

1242
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,960
realized that cats affected her son's

1243
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,599
skin condition but in reality Ashley had

1244
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,280
already given their pet cat away four

1245
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:04,720
months be the Hawaii Retreat even took

1246
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:08,960
place again Ashley Foster is a

1247
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,119
liar then on July 14th of 2018 Ashley

1248
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,119
texted the same

1249
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:18,920
friend poor little is so bad it's

1250
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:22,440
breaking my heart anything I can do I'm

1251
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:26,119
drinking celery juice nettle tea off all

1252
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,640
green and oil and very low fat is

1253
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:34,280
getting little sips of celery juice too

1254
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,280
I'm taking zinc and vitamin C in high

1255
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,960
quantities the friend said poor baby is

1256
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:45,839
this worse than he was at the

1257
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:49,160
start h no it was worse at one

1258
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,319
point the friend asks it's been ebbing

1259
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,280
and flowing then or just gotten a little

1260
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:57,240
better and not gone up and

1261
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,920
down Ashley says that's sort of what

1262
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,920
it's

1263
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,359
done the friend replies well that's

1264
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,839
normal for a rash at least a bad one

1265
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:08,839
anyway it could still just be that his

1266
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,960
immune system is weakened still from the

1267
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:13,319
cat and the allergic reaction and it

1268
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,160
will get better soon if it's not worse

1269
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:19,520
right now that's a good sign are you

1270
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:22,920
drinking a lot of OJ and Ashley

1271
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,520
says no yeah it isn't continuing to get

1272
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,599
worse at

1273
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:32,799
least just slower to calm down than I

1274
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,039
thought Anthony had told Ashley already

1275
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,799
that the cat was a trigger for her son

1276
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,119
and Ashley had gotten rid of the cat

1277
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:41,559
nearly a month prior to this

1278
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,720
conversation as you can see everyone

1279
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:46,200
Ashley spoke to was well aware that the

1280
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,440
cat was a trigger because as Ashley said

1281
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,760
in her own text messages that was

1282
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,319
something Anthony had told her from the

1283
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,079
beginning on August 15th of 2018 the

1284
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,240
same friend asked how

1285
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,920
and Ashley

1286
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,640
replied he's not great pal but I'm

1287
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,720
trying to be patient we're having our

1288
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,599
whole house cleaned top to bottom this

1289
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,680
weekend including all furniture and our

1290
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,400
HVAC system it still hasn't been as bad

1291
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,400
as at its

1292
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:23,280
worst the friend says a poor little

1293
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,799
guy keep the date that Ashley got her

1294
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,960
house and HVAC system cleaned in mind

1295
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,039
for lat

1296
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,680
August

1297
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:34,480
15th in a conversation that took place a

1298
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,400
month later on September 19th of 2018

1299
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,760
Ashley says

1300
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,680
this still dealing with skin but I spoke

1301
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,319
with Aunt and he got us on the right

1302
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,440
track I think we'll be through it in the

1303
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:50,359
next few weeks I was having very little

1304
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,200
fat like maybe one tablespoon of cashews

1305
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:56,280
a day but it turns out it's not the fat

1306
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,000
itself it's the nuts he actually said

1307
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,559
said like olive oil would be better than

1308
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:06,160
cashews in terms of helping heal so I

1309
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:09,480
got completely off any Not seeds he

1310
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,200
seems like he's starting to come through

1311
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,400
it so now we're getting into what was

1312
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:18,359
happening with the fats the friend

1313
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,799
responded I'm thrilled about yippe keep

1314
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:23,839
me posted on his continued healing been

1315
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,480
praying for him next we're going to read

1316
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:30,000
off a series of texts Ashley sent to a

1317
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,200
friend also in mid-september of 2018

1318
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,760
telling the true story consistent with

1319
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,880
the last text thread we just read off of

1320
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,240
what Ashley had discussed with Anthony

1321
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,880
about her son's

1322
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:47,359
skin nothing crazy but he set to give a

1323
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,599
little vitamin c 200 mgram per day and

1324
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,160
that I shouldn't be eating any nuts or

1325
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:55,520
seeds he actually said olive oil is fine

1326
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,200
but no nuts or seeds because of the

1327
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,960
ariny

1328
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,160
and then he said lots of squashes and

1329
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,079
green juices for

1330
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:06,520
[Music]

1331
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:09,760
me if you remember in the fabricated cat

1332
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:11,559
story Ashley told in 2020 Ashley said

1333
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,000
the real turning point was when she

1334
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,839
realized her son had a cat allergy while

1335
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,400
they were in Hawaii with a cat in their

1336
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:21,760
Airbnb in the real story of what

1337
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,760
actually happened the true turning point

1338
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,839
was when Ashley listened to Anthony's

1339
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,440
guidance to cut out nuts and seeds

1340
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:31,880
when she realized it was not the fat

1341
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,200
that was the problem it was the nuts and

1342
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,480
seeds

1343
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,160
specifically when Ashley cut those out

1344
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,319
as she said in her own words her son

1345
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,319
started to turn the corner and get

1346
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:46,400
better and then from October 15th

1347
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:49,079
through October 21st of 2018 Ashley

1348
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,760
hosted a retreat in Hawaii this is the

1349
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,440
retreat that took place right before

1350
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,520
Stephanie passed away I've spoken to

1351
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,160
individuals who were at this Retreat one

1352
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,520
of them shared with me first of all that

1353
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,200
there was not a cat in any of Ashley's

1354
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,039
airbnbs only an outdoor cat around one

1355
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,480
of the airbnbs that was not allowed

1356
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:08,079
inside this person also shared with us

1357
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,480
that at the retreat Ashley started

1358
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,880
eating nuts again and that is the real

1359
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,920
reason why her son's skin flared up

1360
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,480
again I have a copy of the menu Ashley

1361
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,839
created for the retreat and it has nuts

1362
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,280
in at least one of the meals for almost

1363
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:25,480
every single day of the

1364
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,839
retreat here are some examples from the

1365
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,680
menu we've got a chopped salad with

1366
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,640
Branch dressing which included Brazil

1367
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,319
and cashew nuts a taco bar with cashew

1368
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,520
cream which is basically all cashew

1369
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:41,200
there was a cashew curry sauce which is

1370
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,720
basically all cashew as well there was a

1371
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,880
pasta with cashew butter in the sauce

1372
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,520
There was a macadamia nut parmesan which

1373
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,960
is basically entirely made from

1374
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,799
macadamia nuts there were potato

1375
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,319
pancakes with a roasted garlic cream

1376
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:56,799
sauce which is basically all cashew

1377
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,599
again there was a pad tie with almond

1378
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,720
butter in it there were sweet potato

1379
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,280
fries with a cilantro lime Crea which is

1380
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,319
basically all cashew there was a

1381
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,200
horseradish sauce which included a lot

1382
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:11,599
of cashews there was also an option for

1383
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,920
almond butter sauce on Collard wraps

1384
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,160
this was a menu again that Ashley

1385
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,119
created herself and there are

1386
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,880
individuals who witnessed Ashley eating

1387
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,240
these dishes with nuts throughout the

1388
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,520
course of the

1389
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,760
retreat when Ashley returned from The

1390
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,240
Retreat she got off of nuts and seeds

1391
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,520
again and that is when her son's eczema

1392
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,319
cleared up for good again there are

1393
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,319
witnesses it is not possible that

1394
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:38,200
Ashley's son was still being affected by

1395
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,839
their household cat around the time of

1396
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,359
the October Retreat like Ashley said in

1397
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:45,520
her fabricated 20120 version of the cat

1398
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:48,000
story I'm going to walk through the

1399
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,640
facts of the timeline Ashley first

1400
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,520
texted Anthony's wife when she was

1401
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:56,559
thinking about getting the cat on June

1402
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:59,599
7th of 2018 the text says this

1403
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,280
okay we're thinking of taking in our

1404
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:04,280
friends can possible to keep it on a

1405
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,680
vegan

1406
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,839
diet I have to put out a disclaimer

1407
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,599
first that Anthony has shared publicly

1408
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:12,760
that he does not recommend having cats

1409
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:15,000
on a vegan diet and Anthony's wife

1410
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,480
expressed this to Ashley at the time

1411
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,760
we're just reading this off to show that

1412
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,160
Ashley got the cat around this time in

1413
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,160
June and then the thread we read

1414
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,559
previously included Ashley confirming

1415
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,640
that she gave the cat away on June 24th

1416
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,839
of 201 2018 so between the time Ashley

1417
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,480
was considering taking the cat in on the

1418
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:36,359
7th and the date she gave it away on the

1419
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:41,599
24th Ashley only had the cat for a

1420
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:44,760
maximum of 18 days in June June 24th the

1421
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,839
day she gave the cat away is 4 months

1422
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:51,440
before Ashley was in Hawaii for her

1423
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:54,480
Retreat this alone makes Ashley's 2020

1424
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,119
fake version of the cat story entirely

1425
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,000
impossible

1426
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,240
but the actual turning point in his

1427
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,279
healing came when we went to Hawaii and

1428
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,839
realized that he was severely allergic

1429
01:02:05,279 --> 01:02:10,079
to cats CU he was doing really well and

1430
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:13,839
then we changed airbnbs to an Airbnb

1431
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,760
where there was a cat and he started

1432
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:19,760
breaking out an eczema again like the

1433
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,760
following morning just like full body

1434
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,960
hives she claimed that she realized her

1435
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,720
son was allergic to cats because he was

1436
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,799
doing really well at first when they

1437
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,200
went to Hawaii in October of 2018 and

1438
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:34,960
that it was because he got relief from

1439
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,319
the cat that they had at home but in

1440
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,160
reality the cat had already been gone

1441
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:42,079
for 4

1442
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,000
months Ashley had sent this text on June

1443
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:49,279
28th of

1444
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,520
2018 CAD has been gone 4 days we gave it

1445
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:54,760
to our friends who wanted it really

1446
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:58,440
badly I really love having a pet around

1447
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:02,279
but they create so so much mess and our

1448
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,279
home just feels so clean

1449
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:09,319
now I will say again that Ashley Foster

1450
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,799
is a liar the cat story she told

1451
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:14,200
publicly in 2020 was

1452
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:17,279
fabricated and she went on to tell more

1453
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,440
fabricated versions of it keep the facts

1454
01:03:17,279 --> 01:03:22,400
and records of what really happened with

1455
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,880
Ashley son his eczema and the cat in

1456
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,720
mind as I unpack several other

1457
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,119
fictitious cats story versions the facts

1458
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,640
are that Anthony did tell Ashley that

1459
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:35,119
the cat was a factor in her son's eczema

1460
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,799
he did not get it wrong or miss the cat

1461
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:41,559
allergy Ashley only had the cat for a

1462
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:44,200
maximum of 18 days and got rid of it 4

1463
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:46,440
months before the October Retreat

1464
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,400
Anthony only told Ashley to avoid nuts

1465
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,839
and seeds specifically her son's skin

1466
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,000
started improving when she implemented

1467
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:56,000
that and then his eczema flared up again

1468
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,880
in October because Ashley started eating

1469
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,720
nuts again at the retreat in Hawaii

1470
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,960
Ashley's son's eczema cleared up for

1471
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,720
good when Ashley got off of nuts and

1472
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,240
seeds again several months after she had

1473
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,240
already given the cat away and gotten

1474
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,400
her house deep

1475
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,960
cleaned when the plotters made their

1476
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,480
attempt to recruit me last year on a

1477
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,760
call that I legally recorded Ashley was

1478
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,079
trying really hard to convince me that

1479
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,079
Anthony is a liar and a fraud she told

1480
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,240
me a false version of the infamous cat

1481
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,000
story that was even more fabric ated

1482
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,839
than the false version that we just

1483
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,880
played from her 2020 live stream I'm

1484
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:34,640
going to go through and actually count

1485
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,240
the number of falsities from the cat

1486
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,200
story she told me personally on the

1487
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:43,359
phone because there are so

1488
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:46,680
many um I then gave birth to my middle

1489
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:49,680
son and he got like full body eczema

1490
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:52,079
when he was born and I remember asking

1491
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,680
Anthony what to do what do I do about

1492
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:59,000
this I was a breastfeeding mom he put me

1493
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:01,400
on a fat free raw diet um which I stayed

1494
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,400
on for

1495
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,839
months we've got falsity number one in

1496
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
this version she says Anthony put her on

1497
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:12,319
a fat-free diet in previous version she

1498
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,839
had said Anthony told her avocado and

1499
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:18,640
olive oil were okay in reality he said

1500
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:22,039
nuts and seeds specifically were the

1501
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,599
problem not fats as a whole falsity

1502
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:27,400
number two Ashley added here that he

1503
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,920
told her to eat raw food only this is

1504
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,760
the only one of nine versions of the cat

1505
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,160
story in which she mentioned this and it

1506
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,440
is not true in one of the text threads

1507
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,240
we just read from Ashley told a friend

1508
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,520
while the outbreak was happening in real

1509
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,680
time that Anthony had suggested for her

1510
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:46,160
to eat lots of squashes and said that

1511
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:48,599
olive oil was okay I'm positive Anthony

1512
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,319
that you did not mean for Ashley to only

1513
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:53,839
consume all of those squashes raw and to

1514
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:57,240
only have olive oil

1515
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:59,960
raw I did not tell Ashley to eat raw or

1516
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,960
to eat fat-free for her son's eczema

1517
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,359
Ashley's lying

1518
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:07,000
again right and we've also got falsity

1519
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:09,000
number three here with Ashley saying

1520
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,640
that she stayed raw and fat-free for

1521
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,359
months someone I've spoken to who knows

1522
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,839
Ashley witnessed her consuming both

1523
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:18,039
cooked food and fats during this time

1524
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,960
Ashley only cut out nuts and seeds for

1525
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:21,680
about one month and then at her Retreat

1526
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,400
she was eating nuts again as well as

1527
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,240
other fats and cooked food even during

1528
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,680
the one month that she cut out nuts and

1529
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,760
seeds Ashley was still eating other fats

1530
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,839
and cooked

1531
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,960
food there is a publicly available

1532
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:37,359
YouTube video that was submitted to us

1533
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:41,160
of a vegan G together that took place on

1534
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:44,160
August 14th of 2018 and the video stars

1535
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,799
Ashley this is just under two months

1536
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,960
after Ashley's Sun broke out with eczema

1537
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:52,119
Ashley is shown in the video with a

1538
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,640
salad with avocado and cooked potato

1539
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:57,279
cakes with dollops of cashew aoli cream

1540
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,559
and avocado on top sitting next to her

1541
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:02,960
son and you can see his active eczema a

1542
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,079
witness who was at the Gathering saw

1543
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,680
Ashley eating the salad with avocado and

1544
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:11,200
the cooked potato cakes with cashew oi

1545
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,119
cream and avocado on top cashew oi cream

1546
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,279
is very dense and takes a lot of cashews

1547
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,240
to make this is yet another piece of

1548
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:19,720
evidence to show that Ashley's claim of

1549
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,799
being on a raw fat-free diet is

1550
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,640
completely

1551
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:27,440
false during my call with Ashley she

1552
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,119
continued on

1553
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:34,279
um and he told me all this different

1554
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:37,200
stuff we have like a billion air

1555
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:39,799
purifiers this is falsity number four

1556
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,680
Ashley didn't have air purifiers until

1557
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:44,559
after her son's eczema had cleared up

1558
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,200
the air purifiers she got were for

1559
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,039
remediation from the Malibu fires they

1560
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,400
had nothing to do with the cat or her

1561
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,960
son's skin and it was during a different

1562
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,079
time period it's a whole other separate

1563
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,200
story which we're going to cover later

1564
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,839
that as conflated with this false

1565
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,000
version of the cat story when she told

1566
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:06,000
it to

1567
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,200
me we I was not eating I mean I wasn't

1568
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,799
eating anything I was eating fruit and

1569
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:13,480
some

1570
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:15,799
grains falsity number five now Ashley's

1571
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,600
down to saying she wasn't even eating

1572
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:21,480
vegetables just fruit and greens that's

1573
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,319
how the number two plotter Ashley's

1574
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:26,560
friend Robbie Barbaro eats somehow it's

1575
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,560
not restrictive to her when he does

1576
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,319
it but there are witnesses who observed

1577
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,679
Ashley eating many foods other than

1578
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,359
fruit and greens during this time such

1579
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,159
as plenty of potatoes and beans in

1580
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:40,199
another version of this story Ashley

1581
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,839
said she was eating nuts and seeds up

1582
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:45,839
until a month before the retreat and as

1583
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:48,600
we covered she reintroduced nuts at The

1584
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:50,679
Retreat and at Ashley's Retreat there

1585
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,120
were plenty of vegetables on the menu

1586
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:57,000
that she created herself lots of

1587
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,799
potatoes radishes yams asparagus carrot

1588
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,120
red cabbage and more along with other

1589
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:05,799
foods like coconut ice cream kelp

1590
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:08,279
noodles raw honey maple syrup Wasabi

1591
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:09,799
aerrow root and much more than just

1592
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,120
fruit and

1593
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:13,640
greens furthermore in a different

1594
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,960
version of the cat story I'm going to

1595
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,239
share from Ashley later Ashley says in

1596
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,040
her own words that she was eating

1597
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:23,400
vegetables during this

1598
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:25,400
time obviously Ashley's purposely trying

1599
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,960
to make it look like Anthony put her on

1600
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:30,159
some kind of extremely restrictive diet

1601
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,000
which he did not by telling these

1602
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:34,880
falsities because she has to convince

1603
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,679
people somehow that Anthony's a bad guy

1604
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,719
or

1605
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:41,799
something and he kept saying like just

1606
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:44,159
keep going he's cleansing his liver

1607
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:46,600
cleansing my hair was falling out my

1608
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,600
nails were

1609
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:52,480
breaking oh the drama there's so much

1610
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,960
that's wrong with this part of her fake

1611
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,679
story from the false he's just cleansing

1612
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,440
narrative to her false Health claims

1613
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,880
that we're going to be unpacking further

1614
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,400
in another episode for now I'm just

1615
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:07,320
going to stick to the main falsities

1616
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,480
falsity number six here Ashley's

1617
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,719
omitting the fact that her son's skin

1618
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:14,239
did clear up after she made the dietary

1619
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:16,000
changes Anthony suggested she's doing

1620
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:19,000
this to make it sound like what Anthony

1621
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,360
suggested wasn't working while it was so

1622
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,320
restrictive that it was harming her in

1623
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,480
reality Ashley took some time to

1624
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,320
implement what Anthony had had suggested

1625
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,360
which was to Simply remove nuts and

1626
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,360
seeds and as you guys heard in her own

1627
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,679
text messages from the true version of

1628
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:39,520
the cat story Ashley said that once she

1629
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:43,080
did that her son's skin started clearing

1630
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,199
up and falsity number seven Ashley was

1631
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,880
dealing with pre-existing symptoms and

1632
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,679
conditions before she ever started

1633
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,760
applying medical medium information

1634
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,960
including hair loss and there is plenty

1635
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,760
of evidence of that that Ashley maybe

1636
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,960
doesn't remember

1637
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,520
I mean it's got to be a full-time job at

1638
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,719
this point for her to keep her lies

1639
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,560
straight when she's being so obscenely

1640
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:06,679
dishonest all over the place these

1641
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,719
pre-existing symptoms like hair loss

1642
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:10,719
however presented long before Ashley was

1643
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:14,080
recommended by Anthony to remove nuts

1644
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:18,719
and seeds for the one month or so that

1645
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,640
she actually did in total so restrictive

1646
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,360
I

1647
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,199
know in fact in one of the ebooks that

1648
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,040
Ashley had sold to the medical medium

1649
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:29,000
Community years ago Ashley wrote this

1650
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,880
about what was going on with her health

1651
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,280
during the time that she gave birth to

1652
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,400
her other child that she had before her

1653
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,400
son who had the eczema

1654
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:43,719
outbreak after was born my health

1655
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:48,440
crashed even more severely my depression

1656
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:51,560
became so intense magnified 100 times

1657
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:55,440
getting out of bed felt impossible and

1658
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:59,120
at times it was my hair fell out my my

1659
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:02,800
skin grew dull and pale I felt horrible

1660
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:05,719
in my own body and for a brief period I

1661
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,960
even battle thoughts of suicide I

1662
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:11,800
weighed 185 lbs and my entire body

1663
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:16,040
seemed to Sag in the aftermath of

1664
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,400
creating new life at 6 months postpartum

1665
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:21,719
I found help from Anthony William who

1666
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,719
wrote the book medical

1667
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:27,760
Medium as you can see from Ashley's own

1668
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,280
testimony of her healing Journey from

1669
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,719
before she got mad at Anthony and

1670
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,440
started telling these fake stories and

1671
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,600
trying to rewrite history Ashley's hair

1672
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:39,199
loss was happening after she had her

1673
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,280
first baby which was 6 months before she

1674
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,080
ever interacted with Anthony or his

1675
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,239
information in the first

1676
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:48,719
place Ashley's using this falsity as a

1677
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,679
tactic to mess with other women's heads

1678
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,960
it's a great way to scare women who are

1679
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:55,840
applying medical medium information

1680
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,159
women do not want to lose their hair or

1681
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,760
the health of their

1682
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:03,520
nails yeah and that's real

1683
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:06,199
fear-mongering somebody who has to twist

1684
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,159
stories like this in order to try to

1685
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:10,320
scare and mess with the heads of women

1686
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:13,000
who are already struggling to serve

1687
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:15,360
their own agenda is clearly someone who

1688
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,800
is operating from a place of malice and

1689
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,560
not from a place of

1690
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,920
Sanity during our call Ashley continued

1691
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:25,639
to tell me this fake cat

1692
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:27,639
story um we went to Hawaii actually with

1693
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:29,719
Taylor to do a retreat with

1694
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:31,639
Taylor while we were there we were

1695
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:33,159
staying at an Airbnb with a cat and

1696
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:35,639
halfway through the retreat we moved to

1697
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:39,159
an Airbnb without a cat we also had a

1698
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:41,360
cat um when we moved to the Airbnb

1699
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:43,520
without a cat my son's eczema went away

1700
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,320
within like the three days that we were

1701
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:49,679
there falsity number eight what's funny

1702
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,199
is that this is the opposite from other

1703
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,440
versions of the false story that

1704
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:56,040
Ashley's told in another false version

1705
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,600
Ashley said that the cat was in the

1706
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,520
second Airbnb and now she's saying that

1707
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,639
the cat was in the first

1708
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,719
Airbnb as we stated previously a witness

1709
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,840
who was at the retreat said that there

1710
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:09,199
was actually not a cat in either of

1711
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,239
Ashley's

1712
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,040
airbnbs falsity number nine in this

1713
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,280
version Ashley's claiming that her son's

1714
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,560
eczema went away within 3 days while

1715
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,719
they were in Hawaii in the real story

1716
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,560
from Ashley's own text messages remember

1717
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:27,760
that her son's eczema actually started

1718
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,639
clearing up one month before the Hawaii

1719
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,159
retreat in October Ashley's son's eczema

1720
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:34,280
flared up again while they were in

1721
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,639
Hawaii because Ashley started eating

1722
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,520
nuts

1723
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:41,639
again so we got home we gave the cat to

1724
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,480
a friend we had our um air conditioning

1725
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:45,480
and it cleaned his eczema went away and

1726
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:49,159
it never came

1727
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:50,960
back falsity number 10 if you remember

1728
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:52,960
back to one of the text threads we read

1729
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,159
from Ashley's real version of the cat

1730
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,719
story sent to a friend on August 15th of

1731
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:01,120
2018 Ashley said

1732
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,199
this we're having our whole house

1733
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:07,960
cleaned top to bottom this weekend

1734
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:07,960
including all furniture and our HVAC

1735
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,600
system in fact Ashley had her air

1736
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:17,560
conditioning unit cleaned the weekend of

1737
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:20,880
August 17th which was 2 months before

1738
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:23,639
the Hawaii Retreat not after the Hawaii

1739
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,560
Retreat and that concludes this version

1740
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:29,159
of the cat story leaving us with 10

1741
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,400
total falsities in just one of the

1742
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:34,880
multiple fictitious versions that Ashley

1743
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,320
has told of this cat story Ashley has

1744
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,080
adapted the infamous cat story more and

1745
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:42,320
more with time right after we released

1746
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,159
the first podcast about the plotters a

1747
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,000
lot of people were shocked to figure out

1748
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:48,040
that Ashley was behind this attack on

1749
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,080
Anthony and the community because they

1750
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:52,239
remembered how much Ashley has said in

1751
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:55,280
previous years about how Anthony has

1752
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:57,040
helped her and her family one woman

1753
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,600
recounted what she had seen in a

1754
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,280
Facebook group that she was in with

1755
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,120
Ashley during the time of her son's

1756
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:07,560
eczema problem in a comment thread from

1757
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,760
April 20th of 2023 the woman said aw

1758
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,080
helped Ash's baby recover from pretty

1759
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,600
severe eczema I don't know if Ash had

1760
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,639
issues herself or just her baby I

1761
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,159
remember seeing before and after

1762
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:22,080
picks Ashley replied with another

1763
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:25,360
version of her fake cat

1764
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:29,000
story respectfully can't let let these

1765
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:32,400
inaccuracies go un addressed Anthony did

1766
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,280
not cure my son's eczema he told me to

1767
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:38,239
go on a fat-free diet as a breastfeeding

1768
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:41,840
postpartum mom he recommended it for

1769
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:44,280
months and months and months he

1770
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,760
specifically told me that I just needed

1771
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:50,960
to keep going to detox to help my son we

1772
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,880
went on a trip and realized that my son

1773
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:57,159
was allergic to cats we came back and

1774
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,960
gave our cat to dear friend my son's

1775
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:03,239
eczema went away within the week and has

1776
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:05,719
never come back I however have suffered

1777
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:09,400
incredible depletion from being on such

1778
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:11,520
a restrictive diet for so long I went on

1779
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:14,800
to have two miscarriages while

1780
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:18,480
continuing to follow Anthony's

1781
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:21,719
advice wow this false version is even

1782
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:23,679
more extreme than the last Ashley has a

1783
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:25,560
pattern of escalating the severity of

1784
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,400
her fake stories over time time

1785
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,080
presumably after not getting enough of a

1786
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,800
rise out of people initially here

1787
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,320
Ashley's telling the same falsities

1788
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,199
about Anthony missing the cat allergy

1789
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,320
and that Anthony had told her to go on a

1790
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:41,679
fat-free diet this time she says for

1791
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:44,239
months and months and

1792
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:46,639
months Ashley also told the same

1793
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:49,639
falsities about how Anthony told her to

1794
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:51,719
just keep going to detox her son that

1795
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:53,840
she herself discovered the cat allergy

1796
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:55,800
at The Retreat that they gave the cat

1797
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,800
away after the retreat Retreat and that

1798
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,159
her son's eczema cleared after the

1799
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,920
retreat none of which is

1800
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:05,120
accurate now she's added in outrageous

1801
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,080
Health claims to imply that not only

1802
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,199
Anthony got the cause of her son's skin

1803
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,239
problem wrong but also that his

1804
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:15,000
recommendations were restrictive and

1805
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:17,560
caused her harm she says that she quote

1806
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,880
suffered incredible depletion from being

1807
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:23,120
on such a restrictive diet for so long

1808
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,280
all of this is

1809
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,960
inaccurate again we're going going to be

1810
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,880
thoroughly addressing Ashley's

1811
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,600
outrageous Health claims in other

1812
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,040
episodes for now I'm going to share the

1813
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,480
text message that Ashley sent to Anthony

1814
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,920
when she reached out to him for help

1815
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:40,480
with her baby's

1816
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:43,639
eczema sweet is pretty miserable still

1817
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,280
an I'm doing the basic things I can do

1818
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:51,400
while breastfeeding celery juice low fat

1819
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:54,440
green free zinc vitamin C he's getting a

1820
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:58,560
little celery juice too any other

1821
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:01,000
thoughts for me poor little bugs seem so

1822
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,199
miserable I'm willing to do something

1823
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,639
extreme like a melon juice and green

1824
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:09,040
juice fast or something but I don't want

1825
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:12,480
to detox and make him

1826
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,760
worse Ashley has made it clear over and

1827
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,600
over again that she's never understood

1828
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,239
medical medium information Anthony very

1829
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,320
much advises against things like melon

1830
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:25,159
juice and green juice fasts Ashley said

1831
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,320
herself here that she would was willing

1832
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:31,920
to do something extreme to help her baby

1833
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,280
that was Ashley's input Ashley herself

1834
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,400
has a history of extreme dieting that

1835
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,400
existed long before she ever discovered

1836
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,440
medical medium information in a post

1837
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,639
Ashley made years ago to promote one of

1838
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,760
her ebooks Ashley shared a photo of

1839
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:48,280
herself in a wedding dress appearing

1840
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:51,239
very thin and she said

1841
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:53,920
this I was thin before my first

1842
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:57,440
pregnancy but it wasn't a healthy calm

1843
01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:00,440
thin I used juice and water fasting to

1844
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:03,600
control my weight and it swung wildly

1845
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:06,239
all over the place even at times when I

1846
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,800
was thin I experienced a lot of mental

1847
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:12,280
chaos around

1848
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:15,120
food Ashley's first pregnancy as I went

1849
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,920
through previously was before she ever

1850
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,600
connected with Anthony or medical medium

1851
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,560
information for her son's eczema Anthony

1852
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,719
said no to Ashley's suggestion of melon

1853
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,120
juice and green juice fasting and

1854
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,960
literally recommended for her to Simply

1855
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:34,320
remove nuts and seeds from her diet to

1856
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,360
help him millions of people with nut and

1857
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,120
Seed allergies live without them every

1858
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,560
day it's far from restrictive and nobody

1859
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,600
made her do it she was pleading for help

1860
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,560
from Anthony and again according to

1861
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,480
Ashley's own text messages from the true

1862
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,360
version of this story what Anthony

1863
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:53,199
suggested started clearing up her son's

1864
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,840
skin right away in the same comment

1865
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:59,440
thread from last year Ashley

1866
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:02,600
added for clarity's sake you need to

1867
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:05,000
know that during that entire time we had

1868
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,360
the cat in our house while Anthony was

1869
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,199
calling me and doing check-ins with

1870
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,560
spirit and telling me that the eczema

1871
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:16,440
was just cleansing and I needed to keep

1872
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:18,760
on my restrictive diet weird that Spirit

1873
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,480
never mentioned the cat to him 6 months

1874
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,480
earlier

1875
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:29,520
right I mean is this a joke this is how

1876
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:32,080
dangerous Ashley is every single line of

1877
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,280
that comment is wrong this is a perfect

1878
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,000
example of blatant falsities Ashley is

1879
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:39,080
pedaling to damage Anthony to plant fear

1880
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,800
and doubt to deliberately try to

1881
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,639
convince people that Anthony doesn't

1882
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,000
have accurate information and that he's

1883
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,719
harming people and she's trying to break

1884
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,199
people's Faith she's a faith

1885
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:52,360
Buster here she's saying the cat was in

1886
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:55,159
her house the entire time Anthony was

1887
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:57,840
talking to her but Ashley got rid of the

1888
01:21:55,159 --> 01:22:01,080
cat on June 24th of

1889
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,000
2018 this was 4 months before she's now

1890
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:06,080
claiming that she gave the cat

1891
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,880
away she said weird that Spirit never

1892
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:11,960
mentioned the cat to him six months

1893
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:14,040
earlier right this is false ridiculously

1894
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,320
false Anthony mentioned the cat as a

1895
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:19,440
trigger from day one but this is exactly

1896
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,880
how Ashley deceives and manipulates

1897
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,760
people she's trying to rewrite history

1898
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,480
here to create an entirely false

1899
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,120
narrative

1900
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:30,840
I don't care if people believe in my

1901
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:33,639
gift or not that's okay that comes with

1902
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,560
a territory since I was 4 years old but

1903
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:38,520
people should be able to make that

1904
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:41,960
choice for themselves without a falsity

1905
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:45,239
persuading them I did know about the cat

1906
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:47,920
and I told Ashley plain and

1907
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:49,520
simple as the comment thread goes on the

1908
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,560
woman who remembered that Anthony had

1909
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,480
helped Ashley's baby with eczema

1910
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,960
continued to question Ashley's false

1911
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,040
story

1912
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,320
she said did you have two babies with

1913
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:03,719
skin issues I pulled up my notes I have

1914
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:06,040
414 pages of notes from our group found

1915
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:09,159
a convo between you and Mana about you

1916
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,960
getting a kitten and had a whole body

1917
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:15,120
rash a week after you got the kitten

1918
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,560
Mana suggested zinc and C for you not

1919
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,920
him you asked about the cat and she said

1920
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,120
yes totally about the

1921
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,520
cat the group that this woman is

1922
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,239
referring to was a Facebook group she

1923
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,719
saying that another woman had suggested

1924
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:32,040
for Ashley to do vitamin C and Zinc for

1925
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:33,880
her son's eczema Ashley implemented that

1926
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,840
and then Ashley texted a friend about

1927
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,760
her taking these supplements on July

1928
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:41,159
14th of 2018 months before the Hawaii

1929
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,840
retreat in

1930
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:46,040
October Anthony and people in the

1931
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,159
medical medium Community all knew that

1932
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:50,159
the pet cat was part of the problem way

1933
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:52,880
before Ashley and her son stayed in the

1934
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:55,760
Airbnb that Ashley is trying to claim

1935
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,639
had a cat in it a woman who wasn't even

1936
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,280
involved had

1937
01:23:57,639 --> 01:24:02,600
414 pages of notes from the time that

1938
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,760
this was happening and she knew that

1939
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,800
Ashley's fake cat story on this thread

1940
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:08,520
wasn't adding up and was contradictory

1941
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,440
to the notes she had

1942
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,560
taken in the same comment thread Ashley

1943
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,639
tried to convince yet another person of

1944
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,800
her false cat story to this person she

1945
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,639
said

1946
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:24,400
this here's my experience my son had

1947
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:27,280
whole body eczema from a few weeks after

1948
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,800
after getting a kitten until a week

1949
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:32,880
after giving it

1950
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,400
away I'm going to pause to note that

1951
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,239
Ashley's saying here that her son got

1952
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:41,600
the rash a few weeks after they got the

1953
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:44,360
kitten in another comment on the very

1954
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,960
same thread Ashley said to a different

1955
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:49,719
person that he had gotten the rash one

1956
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,400
week after they got the kitten the

1957
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:55,360
comment one

1958
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:58,239
version my son had whole body EA from a

1959
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:02,199
few weeks after getting a

1960
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:05,239
kitten versus the comment 2

1961
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:07,679
version we had a cat for a week when he

1962
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:07,679
got the

1963
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:13,560
rash which is it Ashley a few weeks or

1964
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,760
one week after getting the cat it can't

1965
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,360
be both this is getting embarrassing for

1966
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,840
the woman who said that she would never

1967
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,960
tell a lie and calls herself a truth

1968
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:25,560
teller Ashley continued on with her fake

1969
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,600
cat

1970
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:31,199
Story the way we realized what was

1971
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:35,199
causing it is that we stayed in an

1972
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:38,719
Airbnb without a cat and he began to

1973
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:41,880
improve then we moved to an Airbnb with

1974
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:44,560
a cat and he declined the difference was

1975
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:48,040
rapid enough that we noticed got rid of

1976
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:50,440
the cat his severe whole body eczema

1977
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:54,639
that he had for six months of his life

1978
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:57,440
went away and never came back so that's

1979
01:25:54,639 --> 01:26:01,040
my experience I feel like a broken

1980
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:01,040
record but that's all I have to

1981
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,280
share here we have a lot of the same

1982
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:09,119
falsities from other fictitious versions

1983
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:11,600
and in this version Ashley also again

1984
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:14,840
flipped the order of the Airbnb with a

1985
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,760
cat and the Airbnb without a cat

1986
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,760
Ashley's saying here that they had the

1987
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,800
cat for six months before giving it away

1988
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,760
which is really funny because the woman

1989
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,679
with 414 pages of notes from the

1990
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,000
Facebook group Ashley originally asked

1991
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:32,560
for help and called her out on that lie

1992
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,600
by commenting PS no mention in my notes

1993
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,280
that you had a cat for months just a

1994
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,760
week this woman is correct that Ashley

1995
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,679
did not have the cat for months as a

1996
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,239
reminder for everyone of the receipts

1997
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:47,920
and the timeline Ashley texted this to a

1998
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:51,960
friend on June

1999
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:54,719
28th cat has been gone 4

2000
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:58,000
days which means that Ashley only had

2001
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,920
the cat for a maximum of 18 days after

2002
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,920
she texted about considering taking the

2003
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:05,400
cat in on June 7th we don't have a

2004
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:07,960
record of the exact date Ashley took the

2005
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,719
cat in after the 7th it very well could

2006
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:12,159
have only been a week before she gave it

2007
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:14,440
away on the 24th but she did not have it

2008
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:18,239
for longer than 18 days and she most

2009
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:21,239
certainly did not have it for 6 months

2010
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:23,600
Ashley Foster's lies are

2011
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:25,760
pathological it's also worth mentioning

2012
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,760
that Ashley interestingly deleted that

2013
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,159
whole entire post along with all of

2014
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,400
these comments a few short days after

2015
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:33,960
she posted

2016
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,920
them that's the end of this version of

2017
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,960
the cat story I hope your head isn't

2018
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,800
spinning too much yet because believe it

2019
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:42,760
or not there are still two

2020
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,920
more the next false version is Ashley's

2021
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,800
first ever public post about the

2022
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,080
infamous cat story from

2023
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,040
[Music]

2024
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,760
2019 when started struggling with his

2025
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:57,440
rash we had no idea what was causing it

2026
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:59,679
but about a week later I started feeling

2027
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,880
it was the kitten we adopted for our

2028
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:05,400
daughter thankfully some friends of ours

2029
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,920
fell in love with sweet Wendell Kitty

2030
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:12,320
and adopted him he so loved in their

2031
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:15,159
home but even after the cat left the

2032
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:18,560
reactions continued they got a little

2033
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:21,800
better maybe but it was so hard to tell

2034
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,800
because it kind of came in

2035
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:27,840
waves okay right here she's admitting

2036
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,800
that they got rid of the cat early on

2037
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,480
not months later and that it still

2038
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,000
didn't fix the problem which is true

2039
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,080
she's leaving out the fact that Anthony

2040
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,320
told her the cat was part of the problem

2041
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,679
and that that's when she made the

2042
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:42,040
decision to give the cat away she's

2043
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:43,960
acting like it was her own Discovery in

2044
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,239
other versions that she claimed the cat

2045
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:47,880
allergy was her own Discovery in she

2046
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:50,880
claimed she didn't make the discovery

2047
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,199
and until going to Hawaii later on here

2048
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,600
she's claiming that she made the

2049
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:56,280
discovery essentially right away

2050
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,600
Ashley

2051
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:02,320
continues on the advice of medical

2052
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:06,320
medium I completely overh my diet and

2053
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:09,679
took out nuts seeds oils anything that

2054
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:13,040
could potentially be an irritant my diet

2055
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:15,239
consisted and still does of fruits and

2056
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,199
vegetables if you want to know more

2057
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:20,560
about what I eat you can check out my

2058
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:25,440
story highlights the diet changes helped

2059
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,440
so much and were a critical component

2060
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:30,119
Ashley's admitting here at least that

2061
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:32,199
the dietary changes did help and were a

2062
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:34,119
critical component she's Miss

2063
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:36,320
representing the dietary changes as if

2064
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:39,199
Anthony had advised her to cut out oils

2065
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:41,880
and only eat fruits and vegetables when

2066
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:44,560
in fact he said that olive oil was fine

2067
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:47,320
and simply told her to cut out nuts and

2068
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,119
seeds in this story version Ashley

2069
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,920
wasn't clear about the timeline of the

2070
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:54,239
dietary changes Ashley only implemented

2071
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:57,719
getting off nuts and seeds after

2072
01:29:54,239 --> 01:30:00,000
September 18th in 2018 and that's when

2073
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:02,280
she started seeing results in her son it

2074
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,480
was only less than a month before she

2075
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,880
went to Hawaii and started eating nuts

2076
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:12,080
again then Ashley said

2077
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:14,719
this but our guy kept on reacting we had

2078
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:18,040
our whole house cleaned top to bottom

2079
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:20,480
including our air ducts that helped some

2080
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:22,960
but it still

2081
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,280
persisted now she's saying that her son

2082
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,719
kept reacting even after the dietary

2083
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:29,280
changes which is not what she said in

2084
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:31,639
other versions and doesn't even make

2085
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,520
sense in the context of the rest of this

2086
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:36,960
version Ashley's also admitting here

2087
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,239
that her air ducts were cleaned early on

2088
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,719
before the retreat and that that still

2089
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:43,320
didn't fix the problem which is true and

2090
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:45,000
contradicts what she said in other

2091
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:47,239
versions about getting the house

2092
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,840
including the air duct cleaned after the

2093
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:53,040
retreat she goes

2094
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,040
on it wasn't until we went to Hawaii

2095
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,040
that we found the fin piece of the

2096
01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:01,280
puzzle we stayed in an airbeam bee that

2097
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:05,360
had a cat in it before we arrived and

2098
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,239
within hours broke out in hives all over

2099
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,239
his

2100
01:31:07,239 --> 01:31:12,440
body here's where it gets absurd because

2101
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:15,560
this part makes no sense after what you

2102
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:17,719
just heard her say Ashley's deliberately

2103
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,920
leaving out so many things from this

2104
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:21,719
story she's leaving out the fact that

2105
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,000
Anthony told her that the cat was a

2106
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:25,679
trigger for her son's eczema and that

2107
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,639
that that's when she decided to get rid

2108
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,400
of the pet cat in the first place she's

2109
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:32,800
leaving out the fact that she was off of

2110
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:34,400
nuts and seeds for less than a month and

2111
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,159
then she started eating nuts again at

2112
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,360
The

2113
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:39,440
Retreat she's leaving out the fact that

2114
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:42,600
the menu she created for her Hawaii

2115
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:44,280
retreat was full of nuts she's leaving

2116
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,239
out the fact that the real reason why

2117
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:49,280
her son broke out in eczema again in

2118
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:51,520
Hawaii was because of the nuts she

2119
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:54,119
reintroduced now Ashley's saying that

2120
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,400
there was a cat in the Airbnb before

2121
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:58,320
they arrived whereas in other versions

2122
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,880
she always said there was a cat in the

2123
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,639
Airbnb while they were there Ashley also

2124
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,440
contradicted herself with this one by

2125
01:32:03,639 --> 01:32:07,760
saying that the retreat cat was the

2126
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:10,040
missing piece acting like it was such a

2127
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,719
surprise when she said in the beginning

2128
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:15,000
of this same story version that she

2129
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,600
already knew their pet cat was a trigger

2130
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,719
and that's why they had given it away

2131
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,560
four months prior to the

2132
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:24,159
retreat and now we have the ninth and

2133
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:27,159
final version of Ashley's cat story she

2134
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:30,360
is still weaving and twisting to this

2135
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:33,159
day Ashley posted this one right at the

2136
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:35,000
end of last year 20123 as she was

2137
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:38,880
rattling off a ridiculous list of

2138
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,239
reasons why Anthony is supposedly a

2139
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:46,000
liar um I have another one with my son's

2140
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:47,880
eczema where he kept telling me it was

2141
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,400
because I was eating too much fat I was

2142
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:55,040
a postpartum nursing mom eating like

2143
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:58,000
less than half an avocado a day um

2144
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,920
and you know he had me testing our house

2145
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,920
for mold and doing all this stuff and my

2146
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,239
son was allergic to our cat and we

2147
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,000
figured that out ourselves

2148
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:11,000
and so that was another one where I was

2149
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
like wait why why was he so

2150
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,119
wrong why was he so wrong my son was

2151
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,920
allergic to our cat and we figured that

2152
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:22,440
out

2153
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:25,719
ourselves versus what actually happened

2154
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:28,400
according to her own text

2155
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:31,679
messages I talked to Aunt and he said

2156
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,679
it's most likely the

2157
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:37,440
cat and she also said that he kept

2158
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:39,040
telling me it was because I was eating

2159
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:43,600
too much

2160
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:46,600
fat versus what actually

2161
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:48,560
happened still dealing with skin but I

2162
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:51,199
spoke with Aunt and he got us on the

2163
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,800
right track I think we'll be through it

2164
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:56,159
in the next few weeks I was having

2165
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:59,080
having very little fat like maybe one

2166
01:33:56,159 --> 01:34:01,480
tablespoon of cashews a day but it turns

2167
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:05,320
out it's not the fat itself it's the

2168
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:07,600
nuts he actually said like olive oil

2169
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,960
would be better than cashews in terms of

2170
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,159
helping

2171
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,840
heal it turns out it's not the fat it's

2172
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:16,520
the

2173
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:19,400
nuts as you can see Ashley Foster is a

2174
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,880
liar who lies about lying while accusing

2175
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:23,960
Anthony of being a liar as she's lying

2176
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:26,920
and has told nine different

2177
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:29,600
contradictory versions of the same

2178
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,760
story yet another contradiction is that

2179
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,800
in one of these versions Ashley claims

2180
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,040
that her only fat Source each day was

2181
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:37,760
avocado and in the other version she

2182
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:40,560
claimed that her only fat Source each

2183
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:43,560
day was cashews these two things cannot

2184
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,920
be true at the same time and in this

2185
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:47,719
most recent version Ashley also added in

2186
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,159
for the first time the claim that

2187
01:34:47,719 --> 01:34:53,719
Anthony had her quote testing for mold

2188
01:34:51,159 --> 01:34:56,760
and all this stuff which is just

2189
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:59,119
blatantly not true that is completely

2190
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:02,239
false and it's very telling that she's

2191
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:04,360
only adding that on now years and years

2192
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:06,679
after she started telling this story

2193
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,920
Ashley likes to try to play to people's

2194
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:12,239
emotions because many people are

2195
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:14,320
concerned about mold I never told Ashley

2196
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:16,320
to test for mold in her multi-million

2197
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:20,040
doll Malibu

2198
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:22,040
mansion further more in only one of the

2199
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:25,560
previous false versions of the cat story

2200
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:29,880
we went through Ashley mentioned

2201
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,480
purifiers um and he told me all this

2202
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,800
different stuff we had like a billion

2203
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:36,040
air

2204
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:38,400
purifiers Ashley was trying to make it

2205
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,560
look like she did everything right she

2206
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,480
followed all of Anthony's advice she

2207
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,880
spent a bunch of money on air purifiers

2208
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:49,280
for the cat dander and still Anthony was

2209
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:52,360
wrong but here is what actually happened

2210
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,280
with the air purifiers in late 2018

2211
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,639
there were massive fires devastating the

2212
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:59,600
area of Malibu California where Ashley

2213
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:02,199
was living at the time on November 9th

2214
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,159
Anthony texted her to check in Anthony's

2215
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:08,080
going to read the text he had sent to

2216
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:09,960
her please be safe hang in their Ash

2217
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:13,080
worried about you and your precious

2218
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,840
babies hope you are okay praying for

2219
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:18,440
your house to be safe too and putting

2220
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,080
light all around

2221
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:23,119
it so Anthony you told her that you were

2222
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:26,119
putting light around her house can you

2223
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:28,480
explain for everyone what that means I

2224
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:31,360
asked Spirit to Encompass the entire

2225
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:33,040
house with a force of light and I was

2226
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,920
envisioning this force of light

2227
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,560
inhibiting

2228
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,520
Flames okay so you did that and then

2229
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,080
Ashley texted you on November 21st to

2230
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,119
say

2231
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:48,560
this okay friend what are we talking

2232
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:51,560
about here the devastation is immense

2233
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,639
the house next to us burnt to the ground

2234
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,400
obviously we want to do the highest

2235
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:58,840
level of smoke remediation we can but

2236
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:01,199
with all of the ash in the environment

2237
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:04,080
and the months it will take to remove

2238
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:07,040
the debris do we need to plan to be

2239
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:10,119
somewhere else for a few

2240
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:13,199
months next Ashley sends a video of her

2241
01:37:10,119 --> 01:37:15,400
husband showing their house in perfect

2242
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,159
condition and then her husband pivots

2243
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,800
the camera so that it's looking through

2244
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:21,520
the burnt part of their Hedges out at

2245
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,320
the empty plot where the neighbor's

2246
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:28,199
house used to be in awe the video gets

2247
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,199
cut off a bit but he says

2248
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:49,320
unbelievable next Ashley sends this

2249
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:52,760
text that's our house versus the house

2250
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:55,840
next door supernaturally protected and

2251
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:55,840
surrounded By

2252
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,520
Angels so Anthony and spirit protected

2253
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:03,960
Ashley's multi-million doll home with

2254
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:06,520
light and the video shows that her house

2255
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,800
was completely Untouched by the fires

2256
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,360
while her neighbor's house was

2257
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,800
completely disintegrated down to the

2258
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,840
ground it's literally right next to

2259
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,639
Ashley's home there's hardly any space

2260
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,480
in between it's just a very tall wall of

2261
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:21,719
Hedges and only a small part of the

2262
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:23,520
hedges burnt down that whole thing

2263
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:25,119
should have lit up in flames and taken

2264
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,760
Ashley's house along with it it makes no

2265
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:28,840
sense there's nothing left of the

2266
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,639
neighbor's house and it's truly a

2267
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,920
miracle that Ashley's home was left

2268
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,880
entirely

2269
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:39,159
intact then Anthony texted her

2270
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,560
back amazing your house was so protected

2271
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:44,119
if you stay there you just have to stay

2272
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:46,719
inside a lot because when the wind blows

2273
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:49,119
there's a lot of Ash in the air that

2274
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,360
will go into your lungs but if you're

2275
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:54,080
inside a lot and the inside isn't

2276
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,599
saturated with smoke smell then you can

2277
01:38:54,080 --> 01:39:01,239
stay there and work with it once the

2278
01:38:56,599 --> 01:39:05,400
rain comes the outside will be so much

2279
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:05,400
better the conversation

2280
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,840
continues okay I think in general we're

2281
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,159
planning to stay away until beginning of

2282
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:15,679
the year and have the whole house

2283
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:19,239
treated with ozone and clean top to

2284
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:23,080
bottom you think by January is a good

2285
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:25,000
bet yes that's what I would do wait till

2286
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:27,360
then

2287
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,679
and we're going to buy some of the IQ

2288
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,679
air

2289
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,480
filters it's important to note here that

2290
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:37,320
in this conversation that takes place

2291
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:40,599
one month after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat

2292
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:43,800
and is about smoke remediation not about

2293
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:45,480
Eczema or a cat Ashley brings up air

2294
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:48,320
filters and says they're going to buy

2295
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:50,480
some for smoke remediation Anthony was

2296
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,840
not the one to bring it up the

2297
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:56,080
conversation goes

2298
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:57,920
on some rain could come in between

2299
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,639
too

2300
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,679
yep

2301
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:06,080
yes lots of rain

2302
01:40:02,679 --> 01:40:08,199
predicted get the multi-gas one plus

2303
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,520
when the rain comes with no brush to

2304
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:14,679
hold it back there will be lots of

2305
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:16,840
landslides so best to be away

2306
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:19,280
yes got

2307
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:22,880
it thank

2308
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:25,639
God Amen so many prayers covering our

2309
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:30,199
home thank

2310
01:40:25,639 --> 01:40:33,400
you okay so as I said this was one month

2311
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:35,159
after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat Ashley had

2312
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:39,320
gotten rid of their household cat on

2313
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:41,719
June 24th of this same year five months

2314
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:44,280
prior to this conversation the air

2315
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:47,280
purifiers were her idea and she got them

2316
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:49,199
for smoke remediation not for pet dander

2317
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:51,920
or her son's eczema like one of her

2318
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:54,360
false versions of the infamous cat story

2319
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:57,400
suggested it's also worth noting that

2320
01:40:54,360 --> 01:41:01,280
this conversation on November 21st about

2321
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:04,199
Ashley's home took place 8 days after

2322
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,639
Stephanie passed away Ashley made no

2323
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:08,679
mention of Stephanie or any problems she

2324
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:10,239
had with Anthony around it but she

2325
01:41:08,679 --> 01:41:13,400
certainly wanted his help with her

2326
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:16,360
multi-million dollar home I know that

2327
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:18,040
this is a lot for everybody to take in

2328
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:20,760
thank you Amber for doing this for the

2329
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:23,320
community the evidence we presented

2330
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:26,599
today shows that Ashley can't get any

2331
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,840
anything right even historical stories

2332
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:31,080
that can be easily fact checked and she

2333
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:33,599
has to fabricate and lie about her own

2334
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:36,239
personal experiences with me to try to

2335
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:39,280
convince people that I got it wrong to

2336
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:42,960
call me a liar and a fraud when as you

2337
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:45,119
can see here she is caught so many times

2338
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,480
in just what has been covered in this

2339
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:50,520
episode alone lying and telling

2340
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:53,280
fraudulent Stories the story about the

2341
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:56,080
ten booms and the Holocaust is a lip m

2342
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,840
test to Ashley's inability to tell not

2343
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:01,239
only stories about Stephanie and me and

2344
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,000
the cat but clearly shows that she

2345
01:42:01,239 --> 01:42:06,440
cannot even get a historic story even

2346
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,880
partially correct it's one thing when

2347
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:11,599
people hear all these versions of lies

2348
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,960
and falsehoods and her madeup stories

2349
01:42:11,599 --> 01:42:16,440
but it's another when you have a

2350
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:19,560
landmark such as the 10 Booms to clearly

2351
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:21,320
see how Ashley can't get it right it's

2352
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,239
another reason why I wouldn't do

2353
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:25,920
business with Ashley when she proposed

2354
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:28,679
so many business deals she wanted to

2355
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:31,159
partner with me on painfully almost

2356
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:33,719
everything she said always had falsities

2357
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:36,280
or mistakes or misinformation saturated

2358
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:38,440
in it what Ashley's been doing with the

2359
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:41,520
cat story is what she's been doing with

2360
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:44,360
her entire smear campaign against me as

2361
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:47,639
a whole it's an endless stream of sloppy

2362
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:51,719
lies and psychological games how sad is

2363
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:54,080
it that I actually did help her son he

2364
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:57,639
recovered and I helped her out of the

2365
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:00,000
kindness of my heart for free I wasn't

2366
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:02,520
making any money from it I wasn't

2367
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,199
gaining anything from it and because she

2368
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:08,760
has nothing to show that I'm a bad guy

2369
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:11,400
or did anything wrong she has to lie and

2370
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:13,520
take something that was positive that I

2371
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:16,599
actually helped her with and was

2372
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,880
accurate about and perverted to make it

2373
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:21,520
look like the exact opposite of what

2374
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:24,520
really happened so that she can try to

2375
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,639
take me down

2376
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:29,000
there are people who have serious mental

2377
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,760
health problems there are people who are

2378
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,480
just inaccurate and get things wrong

2379
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,360
there are people who attack and

2380
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:37,960
intentionally set out to harm other

2381
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:40,760
people there are people who FIB there

2382
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:43,639
are people who are pathological liars

2383
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,440
and then there's Ashley Foster she's

2384
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:49,000
truly in a league of her own this is

2385
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:51,840
unprecedented as we've said and in my

2386
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,599
opinion it should be studied

2387
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,639
clinically what's even more disturbing

2388
01:43:54,599 --> 01:43:59,080
is that this episode just barely

2389
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:01,760
scratches the surface this is what

2390
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,800
Ashley does with every story with every

2391
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:08,679
claim with every rumor she spreads it's

2392
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:10,199
all this distorted it's all this Twisted

2393
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:12,239
it's all this

2394
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:14,719
untrue and the other plotters have

2395
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:17,480
followed suit and have the same patterns

2396
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:19,639
we could do hundreds of podcast episodes

2397
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:22,560
on twisting the lies and falsities like

2398
01:44:19,639 --> 01:44:24,400
this the evidence is all there and this

2399
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,920
is just the

2400
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:28,800
beginning with the Stephanie story

2401
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,960
Ashley and Stephanie's brother are

2402
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,960
abusing the fact that nobody else has

2403
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,080
access to the entirety of Stephanie's

2404
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,119
text threads with all of the people who

2405
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:39,159
were involved or any of the other

2406
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:41,280
evidence to see what Ashley and

2407
01:44:39,159 --> 01:44:43,480
Stephanie's brother have hidden

2408
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,560
manipulated taken out of context and

2409
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,440
altered as they're making outrageous

2410
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:49,920
claims against Anthony and trying to

2411
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:52,480
rewrite history to push a fake story

2412
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,199
we'll get to more of that in due time

2413
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:57,560
the 10 Boom story and the cat story are

2414
01:44:55,199 --> 01:45:00,520
examples that everyone can use to verify

2415
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:03,239
for themselves exactly the level of

2416
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,760
unimaginable reality Distortion and

2417
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:08,119
perversion of the truth that Ashley and

2418
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,520
her hateful group have continued to

2419
01:45:08,119 --> 01:45:12,239
employ with the Stephanie story and with

2420
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:14,880
the other stories that they

2421
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:17,239
tell one online commenter who has

2422
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:19,199
observed the behavior of Ashley and her

2423
01:45:17,239 --> 01:45:21,880
hateful group said

2424
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:24,639
this everything they accuse Anthony and

2425
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:27,639
the mm community of being is what they

2426
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:29,880
themselves are doing to the mm Community

2427
01:45:27,639 --> 01:45:32,400
it's so frustrating and sad the amount

2428
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:34,400
of gaslighting belittling and just pure

2429
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,800
hostility from these people is hard to

2430
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,040
Bear especially after years of suffering

2431
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,199
chronic illness with no answers and all

2432
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,520
the trauma that comes with that it's

2433
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:45,199
painful and scary to witness how

2434
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,119
committed these people are to twisting

2435
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:48,920
reality and taking advantage of people

2436
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:50,040
who don't know any better how do they

2437
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,360
live with

2438
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:56,599
themselves another online commenter said

2439
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:58,400
this it's so despicable what are we in

2440
01:45:56,599 --> 01:46:00,800
high school this is something high

2441
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,960
schoolers and middle schoolers do it's

2442
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,400
Petty and narcissistic behavior it's a

2443
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,199
narcissistic smear campaign it's got

2444
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,760
narcissists written all over it only

2445
01:46:08,199 --> 01:46:12,679
people with hatred in their hearts would

2446
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,000
do this it's obvious but then comes the

2447
01:46:12,679 --> 01:46:16,760
fakeness the lies the smearing of

2448
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,560
another person's name and reputation

2449
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:21,080
Without Regrets they are heartless

2450
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,320
you're supposed to take everyone into

2451
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,960
consideration before you act and speak

2452
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:28,040
that is what adults do they will die a

2453
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:29,560
slow and lonely death on their socials

2454
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,280
and they should regret this the rest of

2455
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,639
their lives but Ashley probably won't

2456
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,960
she's always seemed like she doesn't

2457
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:38,599
actually care about others which is

2458
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,800
depressing and a third online commenter

2459
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:43,840
said this it has become ridiculous now

2460
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,719
Amber I truly hope the plotters just

2461
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,560
fade into the background and leave this

2462
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:50,840
wonderful mm Community alone they are

2463
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:53,199
cruel very childish obsessed with

2464
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:55,080
revenge and embarrassing not forgetting

2465
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:57,360
the Carnage they leave behind that you

2466
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:59,599
mm and the community have to pick up and

2467
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,800
repair for those that sadly fell for

2468
01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:04,119
their

2469
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:06,159
lies Ashley has formed her hateful Group

2470
01:47:04,119 --> 01:47:08,199
by taking advantage of people who

2471
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:10,599
already have an ulterior reason why they

2472
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:12,719
don't like medical medium whether it's

2473
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:14,360
pure spiritual discrimination or

2474
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:16,560
somebody who sells ionizer water

2475
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,000
machines for example who got mad at

2476
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,960
Anthony when he started sharing about

2477
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,560
the downsides of ionizer water machines

2478
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,719
because of how much influence he has in

2479
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,960
the health

2480
01:47:23,719 --> 01:47:27,440
industry they're also taking advantage

2481
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:29,400
of the fact that when people are dealing

2482
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,080
with chronic illness they often get

2483
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:33,719
confused about their

2484
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:35,599
symptoms when somebody's confused

2485
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:38,119
they're may be not reading the books or

2486
01:47:35,599 --> 01:47:40,520
understanding trajectory or flare Cycles

2487
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:42,840
or new exposures they're may be having a

2488
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,760
hard time implementing the information

2489
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,040
they're frustrated with their symptoms

2490
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:48,800
they're emotional they're vulnerable and

2491
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:51,119
then they come across a post from Ashley

2492
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:53,360
Foster that says Anthony is a liar and a

2493
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:56,040
fraud he missed the fact that my son had

2494
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,960
a cat allergy he put me on a restrictive

2495
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:01,360
diet that made my nails break and my

2496
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:04,360
hair fall out it strikes a cord it

2497
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:07,360
instills doubt and fear and that is

2498
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:09,480
Ashley's goal when in reality the story

2499
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,480
she told is the opposite of what

2500
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:13,400
actually

2501
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:16,320
happened it's all lies designed to play

2502
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:18,000
on people's emotions it's sick it's

2503
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,520
manipulative and it's

2504
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,880
self-serving Ashley does not care about

2505
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,599
the chronically ill Ashley doesn't care

2506
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,080
about people healing Ashley has publicly

2507
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:31,239
attacked shamed and humiliated the

2508
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:33,199
chronically ill and women and children

2509
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:36,000
which is going to be exposed in this

2510
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:39,320
series this is all about Ashley getting

2511
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,199
what she wants and she will lie and use

2512
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:45,440
and harm anyone that she needs to in the

2513
01:48:42,199 --> 01:48:48,040
process there's no other way to say it

2514
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:50,119
it is abusive behavior and Ashley needs

2515
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:52,840
to be held

2516
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:55,199
accountable as we are in the process of

2517
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,159
exposing Ashley and her organized

2518
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:59,599
hateful group for who and what they

2519
01:48:57,159 --> 01:49:01,560
really are it's important to take note

2520
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:04,080
of their tactics and patterns that are

2521
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,480
likely to follow the plotters have a

2522
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,599
documented history of initiating attacks

2523
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:11,880
using lies and misinformation and then

2524
01:49:09,599 --> 01:49:14,960
upon getting called out and corrected

2525
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:17,599
trying to flip it and play victim that

2526
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:20,159
is not going to work here all this group

2527
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:22,360
has done is spread verifiable lies and

2528
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:24,840
falsities they've carelessly attacked

2529
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:26,639
and harmed hared many innocent people

2530
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,560
they've used and exploited deceased

2531
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,639
individuals and others in the process of

2532
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,400
trying to get what they want they've

2533
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:35,599
repeatedly explicitly expressed the

2534
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:37,320
intent to harm medical medium and

2535
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:39,239
they've even deliberately tried to stop

2536
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:41,000
Anthony from doing a free event to

2537
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:43,480
support and raise money for the

2538
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,880
community we have every right to set the

2539
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:48,080
record straight and to defend the truth

2540
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,679
with facts and evidence and to defend

2541
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,639
the chronically ill against the

2542
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:55,280
malicious attacks of this group and we

2543
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:58,040
are going to continue to do so we expect

2544
01:49:55,280 --> 01:50:00,480
the plotters to evade and ignore what

2545
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:03,440
they have done wrong we expect them to

2546
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:06,199
continue to lie and spread falsities we

2547
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:08,679
expect them to Pivot onto something new

2548
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:12,199
they'll make up and we expect them to

2549
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:14,719
skew and alter data and to hide critical

2550
01:50:12,199 --> 01:50:17,239
pieces of evidence that undermines their

2551
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:20,639
entire campaign we also expect the

2552
01:50:17,239 --> 01:50:22,719
plotters to fabricate explanations as

2553
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:25,199
they do everything they can to try to

2554
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:29,480
discredit what we're exposing them for

2555
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:31,960
having done and said in their own words

2556
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:35,719
but we are using their own text messages

2557
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:38,679
voice messages social media posts words

2558
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:41,040
