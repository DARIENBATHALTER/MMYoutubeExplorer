when you freeze your bananas

148
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,720
what i like to do just a little tip on

149
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
this freezing banana thing i like to

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,600
kind of keep them whole when i can so i

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
like to keep them whole like this you

152
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,120
know when you freeze them and not freeze

153
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,560
them in tiny little pieces you freeze

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
them in tiny little pieces they might

155
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,720
brown a little quicker here we go there

156
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
you if you if it's tiny little pieces

157
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
but you can't help it that's just going

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
to happen when you're peeling back

159
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,400
bananas you're just going to throw

160
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,080
whatever you got in there but i just try

161
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
to like peel them you know the larger

162
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
pieces you know and throw them in there

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
freeze them you put of course you can

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,600
use any piece of the banana it's great

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,160
but that's just a little tip

166
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
it keeps them from going

167
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
so brown in the freezer long term when

168
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000

169
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320

so

426
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
i'm gonna do some wheatgrass right now

427
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
so i have right here

428
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,199
the

429
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
end cap for the wheatgrass

430
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,440
which is incredible so let's start

431
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
running some through

432
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,000
now i like wheatgrass

433
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,199
sat says can you talk a little bit about

434
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,720
wheatgrass juice benefits

435
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,279
absolutely you know how everybody's

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,399
trying to get chlorophyll

437
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,040
and they're taking chlorophyll

438
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,920
supplements well that's a great mistake

439
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,160
when you separate chlorophyll

440
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
you can't gain anything from it it's

441
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
destroyed did you guys know that so if

442
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,240
you see people doing chlorophyll

443
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,800
tinctures it's a sad thing

444
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,480
they're being totally taken

445
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,800
you cannot separate chlorophyll

446
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,920
anything anybody ever said chlorophyll

447
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,399
is good for you can't receive when you

448
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,120
separate and extract chlorophyll from

449
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,040
something and then put it in a tincture

450
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,880
very important to know this or put it in

451
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
a bottle

452
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,680
so there's all these people out there

453
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
that are getting ripped off with the

454
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,639
chlorophyll

455
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,399
they think it's like great they're

456
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,720
making green water they're putting it in

457
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,839
the water but it's so sad you you guys

458
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,959
because

459
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,639
you cannot separate and isolate

460
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,959
chlorophyll because chlorophyll is

461
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,480
useless when it's isolated because it

462
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
has to have

463
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
other

464
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,440
chemical compounds in there so anything

465
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,040
you hear chlorophyll is good for

466
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,800
you can get it from wheatgrass

467
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,480
that's how it works

468
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
so

469
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,039
now the mm

470
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,280
900 is known to save you money that's a

471
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,280
different juicer right the 900 this is

472
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,799
the 1500 it's known to save you money

473
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,880
because it's got that celery end cap

474
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,559
well i'm using that end cap right here

475
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,439
on the 1500 so i'm juicing really

476
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,679
extracting from this wheatgrass

477
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,799
other juicers can't extract from the

478
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,240
wheatgrass like this juicer can the

479
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,520
mm-1500 so this is important to know

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
like you can't

481
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,400
you can't extract this kind of um

482
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,200
wheatgrass juice from other juicers i

483
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,120
know i've seen it out there

484
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,120
and and so this is yeah

485
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,760
so back to chlorophyll if you want to

486
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,440
know benefits in wheatgrass

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,240
it's everything

488
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,080
they say chlorophyll is good for but you

489
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,640
can't get any of the benefits when you

490
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,240
take chlorophyll by itself you can't get

491
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,240
the benefits it's not going to happen

492
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,720
they destroy chlorophyll when they

493
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,880
extract it

494
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,200
and so everybody's taken for a ride i

495
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,200
thought wheatgrass was bad for you kathy

496
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,919
got together no i never said wheatgrass

497
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,919
so bad for you

498
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
i i said wheat's bad for you

499
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,240
yeah wheat's bad for you

500
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,679
so all right so i'm making a wheatgrass

501
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,640
shot right now so i'm dropping some

502
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,640
wheatgrass in here

503
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,720
[Applause]

504
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
so what i'll i'll show you how this

505
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
works a little bit i probably have

506
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
plenty

507
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,880
for a shot right now but i'm just

508
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
running a little bit more through

509
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,480
so you guys just got on here i'm making

510
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,480
some wheatgrass i'm using the mm-1500

511
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,559
okay i'm using i'm doing the wheatgrass

512
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,919
part of it this tractor wait till i show

513
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
you what i have right here i can't wait

514
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,200
to show you how this works this is

515
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,200
what's incredible about the 1500

516
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
okay

517
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
so

518
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,880
maybe i'll run a little bit more through

519
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:21,799
now other machines won't extract as much

520
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,799
juice in my opinion they just won't

521
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,679
okay

522
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,840
yep

523
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
the pulp is dry

524
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,480
now i just want to tell you guys the

525
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
pulp is dry

526
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,280
do a little bit more

527
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,440
a little bit at a time i'm not trying to

528
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
shove it all in in one shot so

529
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,559
letting it take its time here we go

530
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,039
does this model extract more celery

531
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,039
juice it extracts just as much celery

532
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,400
juice

533
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,919
as the 900 so yeah so that's what's

534
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
incredible

535
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,159
all right so here i want to show you

536
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,720
guys this all right this is really cool

537
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,440
so we'll get a close-up on this

538
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,480
you're looking at the pulp in here

539
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,200
you're looking at how dry the pulp is

540
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,159
the wheatgrass pulp right

541
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,919
other juicers they don't do that

542
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,679
from what i've i've looked for and tried

543
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,520
and so when you're dealing with the mm

544
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,280
1500 or like the other mm-900 that's the

545
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
whole thing because

546
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,400
it would have taken so much more

547
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,159
wheatgrass i'm showing you the

548
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,280
wheatgrass in this bowl it would have

549
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
taken all that plus way more to just

550
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,720
make what's right there when you're

551
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
using a lot of juicers out there so

552
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,880
that's incredible so you're looking at

553
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,559
dry pulp right here

554
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,080
and and that's what's incredible about

555

mm-1500 it's got its own little strainer

597
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
goes right over that which is really

598
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
cool

599
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
let's get a shot glass of wheatgrass

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
going here

601
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,679

so let's pour this in

604
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,840
yeah

605
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,440
can do we can make it a little higher

606
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,640
that's some strong stuff right there

607
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,520
uh-huh

608
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,480
that's definitely some strong stuff

609
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
got some wheatgrass

610
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
i might have to take a little shot right

611
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,120
here

612
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
if you guys if you've ever done

613
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,159
wheatgrass

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,320
it's like it tastes salty and sweet and

615
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
then it kicks you

616
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,720
and then it kicks you at the same time

617
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,480
right you're just like what

618
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
oh yeah this is salty and sweet yeah

619
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
mark james says do you cook the yams

620
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,760
first yes you steam them

621
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,400
i steam the yams first okay

622
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,400
so that's my wheatgrass shot right there

623
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,000
the machine squeezes

624
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
the crap

625
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,120
out of that grass okay you guys just got

626
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
on here

627
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
i'm talking about wheatgrass i'm not

628
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
talking about the other grass think

629
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,960
about wheatgrass

630
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,520
right

631
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,200
so that's it nice and dry the pulp

632
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
i was just showing you that's what the

633
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
mm-15 it's already drying up that fast

634
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,679
right now that's what the mm 1500 that's

635
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,400
what it does it's got the celery end cap

636
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,679
it's got that killer end cap on it

637
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,039
that's the end cap right here i'm

638
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,919
showing you guys that's it

639
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,840
and

640
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,679
this look how dry that is

641
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
it's just it's incredible really and

642
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
then i'm squeezing every last bit out of

643
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
that wheat grass right there you guys

644
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,159
see on tic tac

645
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,159
that's my wheatgrass shot right there

646
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,799
wheatgrass is really powerful it's

647
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,960
incredible now this is a bigger machine

648
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,600
it's capable of doing a lot this is not

649
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,120
like the 900 the 900 is a celery juicer

650
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,799
you can put other stuff like some leafy

651
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
greens through there and everything like

652
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,880
i've showed you

653
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,440
but the mm-900 which is incredible isn't

654
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,279
a nutritional system of nut butters and

655
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,840
nut milks and

656
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,919
and baby food and ice cream

657
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,559
that's an entirely different situation

658
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,320
so this is the mm-1500 but the mm-1500

659
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,480
does celery too

660
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,400
it also does the celery too which is

661
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,720
really incredible and then it does the

662
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
wheatgrass the celery and it really

663
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,880
squeezes it dry which is cool

664
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,400
here's the thing

665
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
a lot of people requested this this is

666
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,799
what they requested so so yeah i want to

667
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,360
deliver here's the thing to understand

668
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,760
about why i like bmm 1500 and 900 right

669
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,840
food costs are going up we know that

670
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
we know food costs are going up

671
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,919
so

672
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,600
if you're going to use a weapon to heal

673
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
like you know this is like a medical

674
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,080
machine i've called i've called these

675
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
juicers the mm1500 the mm-900 have

676
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
called those

677
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
that's what they are medical device

678
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,799
right because that's what they are

679
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,320
i'd rather be on this medical device

680
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,159
here than hooked up at like in the

681
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
hospital like feed

682
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,720
me

683
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,440
me nurse

684
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,080
b

685
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,440
nurse my medication

686
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,320
i'd rather be

687
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,400
on this machine right here so

688
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,720
and so what i like about this machine it

689
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,799
saves me money every time i run

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,240
something through it because it squeezes

691
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,080
the hell out of it when you're running

692
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,440
stuff through it like for instance like

693
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
the wheatgrass

694
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,919
so you get more out of there and i like

695
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,799
that i like knowing i'm saving when

696
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,559
you know things are happening so

697
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,960
sounds like we should have waited for

698
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,919
the 1500 robin actually no the the 1500

699
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,799
1500 is for like all that other stuff

700
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,679
right

701
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,520
the 900 yeah i mean you got the 900 i

702
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,360
got the 900 i use the knife i take the

703
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
900 out but then i'm like you know what

704
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
i want to make a sorbet i want to make

705
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
an ice cream

706
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,320
so then boom i bring the 1500 out but

707
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,080
yeah the 1500's got so much going on

708
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,159
but you know it takes time for like

709
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,760
developments like to to make things

710
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,000
better and better it's not that it's

711
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,320
better than the 900 it's not it just

712
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,320
offers other things

713
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,440
which is really cool offers other things

714
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,120
it's a whole complete nutritional system

715
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,720
which is great

716
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,400
all right so

717
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,679
what are we doing next we're going to

718
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,200
make a restaurant style salsa that's

719
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,200
coming up now so let's do it

720
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
very excited about this

721
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,880
you guys like salsa

722
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,600
what i really love too is i'm going to

723
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,840
tell you right now which is really cool

724
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,840
about

725
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,440
which is really cool is people eat salsa

726
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,200
all the time right and when they eat

727
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
salsa all the time

728
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
they're eating the kind of salsa that

729
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
has vinegar in it so that's the sauce

730
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,960
that they're eating they're eating the

731
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,080
vinegar salsa is what they're doing and

732
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,919
the thing is with that is that

733
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
how much vinegar can you eat it's really

734
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,360
bad you lose your teeth down the road

735
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,159
because of the vinegar that happens all

736
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,320
the time so i'm not a big salsa out of a

737
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,320
jar unless it's vinegar free you know

738
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
what i mean so i'm not a big salsa out

739
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,240
of the jar kind of person at all so i

740
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,159
got my salsa

741
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,159
little clip in here all right

742
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,480
and that's next

743
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,480
let's do it

744
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,240
so

745
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,080
a couple of ways you can do salsa which

746
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,880
is really cool tara appleman he's not

747
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,720
against animal protein correct just

748
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,679
providing the information needed to heal

749
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,320
whether you eat animal protein or not

750
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,720
it's so true it's it's why a big part of

751
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,039
the vegan community hates medical medium

752
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,799
like hates on medical medium it doesn't

753
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,159
matter how many people heal from medical

754
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,760
medium doesn't matter how many people

755
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,000
get their lives back does it matter if

756
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
i'm a chronic illness for 35 years

757
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,120
doesn't matter if i teach doctors in

758
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,640
some of the biggest most prestigious

759
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
clinics around the country and around

760
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
the world about about things like what

761
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,480
causes all these diseases and symptoms

762
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,600
none of that matters to some of the

763
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,880
vegans which you know i we have vegans

764
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,720
here too in the medical meme community

765
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,640
but there's a lot of vegans that hate on

766
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,279
medical medium because

767
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,840
i won't do this whole protest

768
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,520
this big protest against animal

769
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,440
people who eat animal protein like i

770
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,120
won't hate on people who eat animal

771
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
protein so i guess there's a big part of

772
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,240
the vegan community that wants me

773
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,640
to join in and start like throwing

774
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,320
daggers at people who eat animal protein

775
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
and hurt their feelings and tell them

776
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,440
how they're doing terrible things and

777
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,279
there's a big part of the vegan

778
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,480
community that wants me to do that and

779
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,279
because

780
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,440
because i don't they'll say oh he's just

781
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,039
a fruit and vegetable guy or he doesn't

782
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
know anything meanwhile people are

783
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
walking out of their wheelchairs because

784
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,279
of medical medium information so yeah so

785
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,399
absolutely i support people who eat

786
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,000
animal protein 100 and animal protein

787
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,840
isn't isn't necessarily the thing that

788
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
holds people back from healing if you

789
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,279
want to eat animal protein you can be

790
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,360
vegan too and plant-based i love

791
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,360
plant-based foods i love plant-based the

792
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,440
plant-based

793
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,679
angle and people on plant-based all of

794
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,720
it everybody knows that okay so let's go

795
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,720
we're going to make some salsa here

796
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,399
let's go

797
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
so

798
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,320
we're going to do a little bit of salsa

799
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,600
here

800
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,360
there we go

801
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,960
i think i just should get that all

802
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
squared away

803
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
so what i'm gonna do is drop some

804
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
tomatoes in here

805
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,880
so i'm making a salsa right now if you

806
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
guys want to know now what's really cool

807
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,880
about the salsa

808
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,039
just so you know

809
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
is this salsa

810
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,760
is vinegar free

811
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,760
this salsa is raw too

812
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,159
so it's a raw salsa

813
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,279
which is great

814
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,520
so i'm dropping tomato in right now okay

815
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:18,159
now this is a restaurant style salsa

816
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,159
first of all

817
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,840
if you taste this salsa

818
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,320
without vinegar

819
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,399
and all that heavy duty salt like

820
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,880
basically they just throw a ton of road

821
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,200
salt in salsa

822
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,120
and they just vinegar it to death

823
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,080
and

824
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,200
that's not the kind of salsa that i like

825
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,200
it just isn't you know

826
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,960

without the peel

842
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320

847
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,279
so i'm just really excited about this

848
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,159
i'm gonna drop in some more tomato

849
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,360
and i'll show you how i do this this is

850
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,360
so great

851
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,880
there we go

852
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,919
onion fan

853
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,559
lorraine you're an onion fan

854
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,559
who would have known

855
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
who would have known

856
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
there's a lot of people that don't like

857
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,279
onion people like no i can't eat that

858
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,279
like why it's got an onion in it

859
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,720
so i'm dropping some jalapeno in there

860
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,039
now that's what i'm doing so i just

861
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,640
dropped a little bit of some jalapeno in

862
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,480
there

863
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,039
some more onion

864
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,279
some more tomato

865
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,279
right

866
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,159
there we go

867
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,640
so this is great what you do is you'll

868
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,679
scoop off off the top a little bit

869
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
because you'll

870
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,840
the tomato juice is all on the top there

871
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,399
so you gotta kind of give it a little

872
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,039
chance to get down there moving right

873
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,039
which is great

874
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,000
there you go

875
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
incredible

876
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
now

877
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,440
what i love about making my own salsa

878
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,679
is obviously eating it afterwards

879
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,840
so what you do is you take this part

880
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,120
here you mix it in here like

881
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,120
this and now i'm going to mix it up

882
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
and i get it

883
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,360
a nice presentation of it so what i'm

884
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,840
doing is i'm mixing this up right here

885
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,840
there we go

886
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,279
gonna get it in a nice pretty bowl you

887
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,240

888
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,799
right

889
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,159
if you guys can see this i hope so there

890
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,159
you go amazing

891
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,640
this sauce is incredible

892
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,919
now this sauce is extra hot i got a nice

893
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,720
big piece of jalapeno

894
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,399
in there nice big one okay

895
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,840
so that's the salsa right here i'm gonna

896
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,840
get some chips over here

897
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,320

898
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,000

and here's a salsa right here incredible

904
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,679

a half a jalapeno pepper

914
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,720

1023
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,240
so that's what i'm doing if you guys see

1024
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,079
this here

1025
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,839
this is what i love about the mm 1500

1026
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,839
because i'm making a walnut milk

1027
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240
i'm not buying the walnut milk at the

1028
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,920
store

1029
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,079
i'm not doing that where i'm all of a

1030
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,280
sudden buying you know the walnut milk

1031
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,280
in a store or anything like that

1032
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,960
so i'm making it right here with the

1033
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,960
machine

1034
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,480
so this is how i'm doing it

1035
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,200
you like black walnuts i just saw

1036
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,359
somebody say my walnuts are the best

1037
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,240
the nuts are soaked

1038
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,839
then overnight yes that's what i like to

1039
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,280
do when i'm making a nut milk because i

1040
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,280
like this i like to soak them overnight

1041
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,280
right

1042
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,240
and when you soak them overnight

1043
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,320
they almost start to sprout so you have

1044
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,359
to know that even if you don't see a

1045
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,480
sprout

1046
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,119
they're actually

1047
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,800
getting to that edge of practically

1048
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,760
sprouting when you soak them overnight

1049
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,760

so

1087
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,240
i'm moving this out of the way right now

1088
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,079
okay

1089
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,960
now this machine really pulverizes

1090
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,480
really really really really pulverizes

1091
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,160
just so you know i mean that's what it

1092
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,800
that's what it really does it's so good

1093
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,440
at that now that little bit coming out

1094
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,520
that cream you can actually put into

1095
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,400
your because that's what that is right

1096
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,319
there it's a little bit of that cream

1097
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,680
you can use back in the milk and that's

1098
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
what you can do

1099
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,520
and that's what's incredible this cream

1100
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,240
is not nut butter and this is a nut milk

1101
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,560
but you can actually take this the froth

1102
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,599
over here and you can actually take that

1103
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,200
off

1104
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,040
i'm making a mess because i don't have a

1105

1239
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,559
there

1240
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,000
now i want to drop a bomb this is going

1241
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,119
to be good right here this is

1242
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,359
interesting

1243
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,359
okay

1244
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,800
here's what happens when you buy your

1245
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,559
nut butters out there here's what

1246
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,319
happens when you buy all the different

1247
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,119
nut butters the peanut butter the almond

1248
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,440
butter the cashew butter the tahini the

1249
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,520
pumpkin seed butter hemp seed butter

1250
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,079
they add oil

1251
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,520
they add oil

1252
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,760
that's what they do

1253
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,520
so what you're doing is you're getting a

1254
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,119
jar

1255
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,079
of oil

1256
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,920
they add it into it

1257
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,119
that's what they do

1258
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,040
so they add it into it so that's

1259
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,960
important to know now here's the

1260
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,520
difference right here

1261
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,400
this nut butter

1262
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,280
someone didn't remove

1263
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,720
half of the nut butter

1264
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
and then added

1265
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,559
a quart of oil

1266
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,440
even though it's not a quart of oil

1267
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,920
right

1268
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,319
in a jar obviously you know that

1269
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,760
but that's what they do you get less nut

1270
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,040
butter

1271
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,599
and then they add all this oil into it

1272
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,839
that's the game that's the nature of the

1273
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,359
game with all the nut butters still you

1274
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,800
can buy your nut butter of course you

1275
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,400
buy your almond butter and all these

1276
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,839
others definitely

1277
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,640
right

1278
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,880
now

1279
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,720
the walnuts were not soaked i didn't

1280
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,599
soak them overnight to make the nut

1281
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,880
butter

1282
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,960
you don't have to soak them overnight

1283
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
you can rinse them though so you can

1284
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,000
give them a rinse

1285
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,319
when you make your nut butter you could

1286
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,640
rinse your walnuts you can rinse your

1287
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,240
cashews you can rinse your almonds right

1288
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,119
you can rinse them okay

1289
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,440
but i i didn't soak them but you can

1290
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,520
give them a rinse to get like the dust

1291
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,160
off and stuff like that you can do that

1292
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,520
it's a great idea and but this is a nut

1293
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,839
butter right here so i'm gonna put it in

1294
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,839
a little jar

1295
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,640
so i'm putting these pieces in a jar

1296
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,640
right here

1297
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,960
now you can you can shape this in any

1298
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,480
way you want you can pack it down right

1299
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,640
you can do what you want with this nut

1300
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,880
butter but what's incredible about

1301
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,040
walnuts don't they're they're always

1302
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,640
just like this in the sense where you

1303
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,720
know when you cashews it'll be a little

1304
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,599
bit more creamier but cashew butter you

1305
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,480
buy

1306
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,040
they add a ton of oil like that's that's

1307
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,720
real like what they do it's crazy but no

1308
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,400
one talks about it yeah they'll add

1309
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,160
cashew oil they'll add walnut oil

1310
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,440
they'll add almond oil but they're

1311
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,960
adding all this oil is what they do

1312
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,160
right

1313
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,040
so that's how it's done

1314
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,720
okay

1315
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,800
so you can pack down your nut butter in

1316
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,800
here in a nice little jar if you want

1317
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,640
right and then get the rest of it in

1318
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,640
here

1319
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,599
so what happens is you get kind of

1320
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,040
ripped off they put all this oil in it's

1321
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,960
all oily

1322
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,280
it's not actually good for you that way

1323
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,720
when there's that much oil in it

1324
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,480
right

1325
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,559
if you soak the nuts they'll get a

1326
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,280
little softer but i'd say rinsing them

1327
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,280
is great too

1328
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,040
but you don't want it when you're making

1329
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,720
nut butters you don't want to soak the

1330
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,200
nuts long because it makes your nut

1331
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,960
butters go bad later you don't want them

1332
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,480
like that you just want to give them a

1333
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,559
quick rinse or you can go with them dry

1334
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,280
i like giving it one rinse but not

1335
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,800
soaking it so that's a jar of walnut

1336
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,119
butter right there and you can see where

1337
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,440
that moisture is there where like

1338
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,040
there is that oil there that's naturally

1339
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
in that walnut butter you see how it's

1340
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,359
starting to get that like creamy like

1341
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,000
see that creamy

1342
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,960
but but just so you know

1343
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,520
there wasn't four ounces of oil added

1344
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,000
into this and put into the big jar so

1345
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,640
you go to the store you buy the jar and

1346
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,880
you're buying a hunk of oil that was

1347
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,880
added after the fact which is actually

1348
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,960
kind of a little bit scary you know when

1349
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,599
i think about it so that's why i like

1350
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,640
making my own right there

1351
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,200
this is raw too this is not roasted nut

1352
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,920
butter and yes you can you can throw

1353
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:41,119
your almonds or walnuts or anything in

1354
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,040
the oven you can toast them and roast

1355
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,680
them and then throw them into the

1356
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,480
mm-1500 roasted after they've been

1357
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,240
cooled or something you can do that

1358
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,480
that's fine but that's your walnut

1359
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,240
butter right there

1360
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,000
and you can put a cap on it put it in

1361
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,240
the fridge and you're good you got your

1362
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,720
you got your walnut butter right there

1363
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,040
and you can put a nice little cap on it

1364
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,480
and then it goes right in the fridge

1365
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,839
incredible

1366
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,119

1376
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,640
that's amazing actually and then you got

that's a salsa you guys already see the

1381
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,520
walnut butter you guys already got that

1382
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,319
down

1383
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
right

1384
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,960
you guys on tick tock see that telegram

1385
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and see the walnut butter

1386
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,400
i got the wheatgrass g shot

1387
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,400
right there

1388
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,559
that stuff is powerful

1389
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,720
right

1390
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,640
like i was saying before you don't want

1391
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,040
to separate the chlorophyll

1392
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,400
you want the wheatgrass chlorophyll in

1393
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,040
its complete chemical composition you

1394
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,559
isolate chlorophyll and it dies

1395
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,920
it can't do anything because your body

1396
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,280
will see it and be like i don't know who

1397
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,880
you are

1398
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,440
your body

1399
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,760
when when you isolate chlorophyll from

1400
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,200
any fruit vegetable not fruit any

1401
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,359
vegetable or leafy green or wheatgrass

1402
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,440
if you isolate chlorophyll or barley

1403
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,359
grass shoots power if you isolate it and

1404
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,440
it goes in the body isolated your body

1405
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,839
seems like i don't know what you are

1406
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,520
you're missing everything else to tell

1407
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,880
me what you are

1408
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,119
so that's why

1409
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,720
i don't like the chlorophyll drops they

1410
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,559
don't work they never did i've been

1411
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,920
saying that for 30 years

1412
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,440
okay

1413
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,839
we got the wheatgrass juice shot and

1414
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,680
then we got the ice cream right here

1415
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,280
so which is great got that nice banana

1416
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,640
ice cream you can make purees you can

1417
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,640
make anything you want there that's

1418
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,040
that's awesome and then

1419
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,720

and which is which is incredible

1436
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:42,640
because it's that dry pulp right there

1437
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,200
see that wheatgrass pulp that dry

1438
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,799
wheatgrass pulp right there

1439
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,280
