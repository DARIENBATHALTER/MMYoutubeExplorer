that's amazing and it's really a

286
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,720
powerful meditation to brain meditation

287
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
because what happens is when we go

288
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,279
through hardships like losses

289
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,120
heartache betrayal broken trust when we

290
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
have hard times in our life when we have

291
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
struggles when we have all kinds of

292
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,560
emotional hardships of different kinds

293
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
when we go through things what happens

294
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,399
is we get this out of body experience

295
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
where it's not a good experience but we

296
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
get kicked out of her body our soul gets

297
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,240
kicked out of her body for a second

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
and or for a day and we're just numb

299
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,279
from it we get

300
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,880
injured from say someone broke up with

301
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,640
someone and say there's a

302
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
relationship problem or somebody cheated

303
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
on somebody or a

304
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
work partner something went wrong with a

305
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
work partner confrontation or

306
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
something's just so stressful

307
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,360
some kind of struggle some kind of

308
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,440
hardship you know feelings of fear and

309
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
loss and shame and guilt and

310
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
struggles inside our heart all these

311
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,640
things what happens is we get

312
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
disconnected because of these

313
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
experiences

314
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,440
and it creates a little bit of anxiety

315
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,360
or depression depersonalization

316
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
and our soul just gets kicked out of her

317
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
body like the crap gets kicked out of it

318
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
it just boom gets kicked out of her body

319
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
and then fear fills in and we walk

320
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
around fearful we walk around

321
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,440
broken trust we walk we don't trust

322
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
we're afraid to trust we're afraid to

323
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
you know whatever it is and we're all

324
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
these different things and so

325
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
the brain meditation is to repair the

326
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
damage done

327
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
because in this in the emotional center

328
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
of the brain the emotional center of the

329
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,480
brain these neurons they fry when you

330
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
get bad news

331
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
so when you get bad news like what what

332
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
happened

333
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,600
someone did what or what's going on the

334
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
emotional center of the brain just all

335
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,959
of a sudden gets boom like a shot of

336
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
lightning bolts go through like

337
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,640
electricity and then our soul just gets

338
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
kicked out for a little bit

339
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
and those those neurons get chewed up

340
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839
and we end up getting post-traumatic

341
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
stress syndrome we can end up getting

342
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
ptsd

343
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
and so the brain meditation bridges the

344
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
gap it heals the neurons in the

345
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,720
emotional center of the brain

346
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
bridges the gap so the soul and the and

347
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
the brain connect

348
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,519
i mean it's really powerful you can only

349
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,399
experience it if you do it

350
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,120
um so yeah you can use both there's

351
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
with message messaging with angels does

353
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640

is helping my lifelong insomnia

367
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,959
incredible and you know what when fear

368
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,160
is trapped in there and broken trust and

369
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,920
ptsd and

370
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
any kind of hurt that's somewhere deep

371
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,160
down inside there and a soul

372
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
that meditation helps to clear that out

373
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
and bring that out

374
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,200

377
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,959
check this out okay

378
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
meditations are man-made and there's

379
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
nothing wrong with that but they're

380
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,120
man-made

381
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
that's what meditations are it's like

382
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,079
some guy's trying one thing

383
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,040
he some other guy tries it in 1960 and

384
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,480
then another try

385
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,680
1970 and another guy tries it another

386
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,279
guy tries it and then

387
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
there's a style of meditation and then

388
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,920
it gets plugged into yoga then it gets

389
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
plugged into

390
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
and it's all man-made and that's all

391
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
great but but

392
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
the medical medium meditations they're

393
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,040
not man-made i can't make that

394
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,920
meditation

395
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,200
no one can make the brain meditation

396
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
really important to know

397
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
that you just can't make a meditation

398
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
like that it's not something you could

399
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
just

400
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,959
make or man-made come up with it it

401
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,000
doesn't work that way it came from above

402
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,320
so the brain meditation comes from above

403
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that came to me when i was younger and i

404
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
coveted that brain meditation

405
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,760
i covered a lot of the meditations but

406
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
that when i coveted it meaning

407
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
it was just for friends it was just for

408
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,600
family when i was younger

409
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
and to heal their their wounds and then

410
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
i realized why don't i just

411
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,040
podcast this brain meditation so

412
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,040
millions can heal because millions have

413
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
healed from medical medium books already

414
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
with other meditations why am i not

415
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
releasing the brain meditation

416
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,720
and it was like a friend of mine said

417
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
why aren't you releasing this

418
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399

bethany denise hey bethany i trust the

441
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,199
mm information and that is saying

442
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,279
something since there are

443
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,800
very few other things that i trust

444
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,800
everything else made me sicker and

445
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,519
sicker and implementing the mm info is

446
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
the only

447
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
reason i'm healing you know what's

448
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800

449
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,800
the protocols are in there you can

450
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,199

podcast it's uncensored

600
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,960
