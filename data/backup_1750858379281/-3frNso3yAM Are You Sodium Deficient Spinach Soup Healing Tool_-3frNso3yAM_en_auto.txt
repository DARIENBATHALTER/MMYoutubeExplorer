[0.00 - 3.80] spinach soup that's right medical medium
[1.52 - 7.60] spinach soup it's a powerful tool it's
[3.80 - 10.12] not just spinach soup it is a game Cher
[7.60 - 12.88] it can take someone from here to there
[10.12 - 14.36] with their healing it can and I'll tell
[12.88 - 15.64] you why for a lot of reasons we're going
[14.36 - 17.16] to make it and I'm going to make it I
[15.64 - 19.04] got the spinach here I got the celery
[17.16 - 21.00] here I got the tomatoes here got a
[19.04 - 22.40] little basil got some oranges I'm really
[21.00 - 25.16] pumped up about this and we're talking
[22.40 - 27.68] about low sodium low sodium sodium
[25.16 - 30.72] crisis or somebody with low sodium
[27.68 - 33.28] somebody not able to retain sodium or
[30.72 - 34.44] somebody that's actually maybe doing it
[33.28 - 35.92] wrong and they don't know it but they
[34.44 - 39.44] need to do different things to keep
[35.92 - 41.80] their sodium up to par um hey let's go
[39.44 - 46.12] into that right now too so and I have
[41.80 - 46.12] some tea right here Lem bomb
[48.24 - 51.84] tea nice good to see you guys coming on
[50.72 - 54.20] here we're going to be talking about a
[51.84 - 57.16] lot about sodium how much sodium are you
[54.20 - 58.76] on are you doing sodium are you adding
[57.16 - 61.00] sodium to all your stuff so what you
[58.76 - 62.28] hear in the health movement
[61.00 - 63.56] is you'll hear and you've been hearing
[62.28 - 66.12] this probably for years I mean it's
[63.56 - 68.60] going on I think 20 years maybe 30 years
[66.12 - 71.00] as you'll hear out there take salt and
[68.60 - 72.80] put it in some water give yourself some
[71.00 - 74.56] salt water you know take a pinch of salt
[72.80 - 76.52] or a bunch of salt and throw it in take
[74.56 - 78.60] a teaspoon of salt or more and throw it
[76.52 - 80.40] in your water you have to have salt in
[78.60 - 82.48] there do the rock salt do the sea salt
[80.40 - 84.32] do the high quality salt and so that's
[82.48 - 87.08] been a big one in the health movement
[84.32 - 89.76] it's ridiculous it's actually not even
[87.08 - 91.96] correct for somebody what they need and
[89.76 - 93.84] it it's one of those snake oil things
[91.96 - 96.12] that are out there and it's just being
[93.84 - 98.56] passed around there's no science to it
[96.12 - 100.60] there's no real science to it it's just
[98.56 - 103.24] one of those things where it was a good
[100.60 - 105.16] idea hey put salt in your water that
[103.24 - 106.96] will keep you stable and so forth but
[105.16 - 108.96] really it doesn't it dehydrates you
[106.96 - 111.04] further doesn't allow the water that
[108.96 - 113.20] you're drinking to work for you and it's
[111.04 - 115.00] not the right kind of salt so let's talk
[113.20 - 116.16] about different salts as we're doing
[115.00 - 117.44] this right now and you guys if you just
[116.16 - 119.48] came on here I'm making the healing
[117.44 - 120.48] spinach soup the medical medium spinach
[119.48 - 121.84] soup
[120.48 - 124.32] I'm really excited about it it's a
[121.84 - 126.68] powerful healing tool I mean if you use
[124.32 - 128.72] the spinach soup correctly meaning you
[126.68 - 131.04] make it and you consume it you make it
[128.72 - 134.32] right and you consume it on a regular
[131.04 - 137.20] basis what it can do for you how it can
[134.32 - 139.84] just change fibromyalgia ra you know
[137.20 - 142.12] eczema psoriasis chronic fatigue
[139.84 - 143.92] syndrome Lyme disease like what it can
[142.12 - 147.00] do for you is a miracle multiple
[143.92 - 150.52] sclerosis you can literally live on that
[147.00 - 152.72] spinach soup every single day
[150.52 - 154.44] and clear up problems like neurological
[152.72 - 158.00] problems aches and pains tingles and
[154.44 - 159.76] numbness stiffness of the neck um knee
[158.00 - 162.08] problems inflammation all through the
[159.76 - 164.32] body I mean how it can help is just a
[162.08 - 166.96] miracle so we're going to go into that
[164.32 - 169.40] but we're talking about sodium and
[166.96 - 172.00] interesting spinach has a lot of sodium
[169.40 - 173.72] in it spinach does but there's a
[172.00 - 176.12] difference between that and throwing
[173.72 - 177.44] sodium in water so let's talk about the
[176.12 - 179.44] two different sodiums out there so
[177.44 - 182.12] there's commercialized sodium out there
[179.44 - 184.60] that kind that's thrown in junk food
[182.12 - 187.48] processed food fried greasy food out
[184.60 - 189.16] there it's the commercialized salt it's
[187.48 - 191.48] also the salt that you see in the
[189.16 - 194.48] grocery stores that's not like Himalayan
[191.48 - 195.88] rock salt it's not like sea salt or
[194.48 - 198.28] something like that or a really high
[195.88 - 200.76] quality sea salt instead it's the
[198.28 - 203.72] commercialized junk salt it's what I
[200.76 - 205.44] have called All These Years road salt
[203.72 - 210.00] it's in all the food it's in all the
[205.44 - 215.08] restaurants restaurants don't buy 50 $60
[210.00 - 219.76] bags of salt like a $60 bag of black
[215.08 - 221.60] salt a $60 bag of you know rock salt
[219.76 - 224.28] people don't do that in restaurants and
[221.60 - 228.12] restaurants out there worldwide it's
[224.28 - 230.72] just salt it comes in a 50 lb Satchel 50
[228.12 - 233.28] lb bag and that's what goes and it's you
[230.72 - 236.00] know it's all about how you can make
[233.28 - 237.72] that meal as cheap as possible for the
[236.00 - 240.04] bottom line that's what restaurants do
[237.72 - 243.60] out there I mean that is the reality
[240.04 - 245.76] that's life out there on planet Earth so
[243.60 - 246.76] what happens is people get road salt
[245.76 - 251.64] they get
[246.76 - 254.16] commercialized Den nutrient ised salt
[251.64 - 256.84] that's what they do and it's all about
[254.16 - 259.12] you know getting that in all the food to
[256.84 - 261.16] make people like it and make them crave
[259.12 - 263.64] it that's the key and then there's
[261.16 - 268.16] hidden salts hidden
[263.64 - 270.20] msgs yeast extracts which are msgs and
[268.16 - 272.48] you'll notice yeast extracted is in
[270.20 - 275.76] everything these days now I mean it's
[272.48 - 279.12] gone from here to here like it used to
[275.76 - 280.96] be just in one item here one item there
[279.12 - 284.36] in the past now it's in everything
[280.96 - 287.88] organic foods packaged Foods soups
[284.36 - 292.44] sauces you see yeast extract everywhere
[287.88 - 295.84] what that is is MSG toxic MSG and it's
[292.44 - 299.84] thrown in everything toxic MSG with
[295.84 - 301.12] added road salt commercialized sodium
[299.84 - 304.92] other different
[301.12 - 308.64] chemicals thrown in tagged and named as
[304.92 - 310.36] yeast extract thrown in everything out
[308.64 - 312.36] there that you see now you'll see it in
[310.36 - 315.36] sauces and soups like I said you'll see
[312.36 - 317.72] it in packaged Foods canned stuff you'll
[315.36 - 319.32] just see yeast extract everywhere out
[317.72 - 322.04] there so you got to look out for that
[319.32 - 326.08] the yeast extract is not good but it's
[322.04 - 328.24] another form of bad sodium another form
[326.08 - 329.32] of bad sodium really important to know
[328.24 - 330.92] so I'm trying to cruise through this
[329.32 - 333.36] information cuz I got a lot of
[330.92 - 335.36] information and I'm trying to like I'm
[333.36 - 337.48] trying to spill it out the best I could
[335.36 - 339.64] for you guys so let's hit it so you got
[337.48 - 341.96] the commercialized rock salt I mean not
[339.64 - 345.08] rock salt commercialized road salt you
[341.96 - 347.12] have that called it that for years it
[345.08 - 349.64] doesn't have the nutrients it doesn't
[347.12 - 352.96] have the profile in it and then you have
[349.64 - 354.36] other salts bleached salt yeah they
[352.96 - 357.64] actually have
[354.36 - 359.32] bleached sodium if you can imagine not
[357.64 - 361.28] only just commercialized it but they
[359.32 - 364.44] bleach bleached it that's a whole
[361.28 - 366.92] another game too now that's not as
[364.44 - 371.80] popular anymore but back in the 60s and'
[366.92 - 376.92] 7s salts were bleached so we've learned
[371.80 - 379.32] to acclimate and learn to like salt even
[376.92 - 382.12] if we don't realize it we've learned to
[379.32 - 384.88] like it we become addicted so we're a
[382.12 - 387.72] society today that is addicted to Salt
[384.88 - 391.04] now a lot of coffee shops put salt in
[387.72 - 394.60] the water in the machines so it becomes
[391.04 - 396.88] coffee Salt Water coffee they don't
[394.60 - 400.32] advertise it you don't know it nobody
[396.88 - 402.64] knows it but sodium is in a lot of
[400.32 - 405.00] coffees out there it's in a lot of
[402.64 - 407.92] coffee shops it's in a lot of um coffee
[405.00 - 409.40] chains not in everyone not in everywhere
[407.92 - 411.40] so you might know somebody be like they
[409.40 - 413.40] don't put sodium in their coffee there
[411.40 - 415.84] you go medical medium but let me tell
[413.40 - 417.72] you a lot of them do and there's a
[415.84 - 420.44] reason for that they want it salt they
[417.72 - 422.68] want their coffee salty and then when
[420.44 - 424.60] you add your sugar and your milks or
[422.68 - 426.96] whatever you add your soy whatever it is
[424.60 - 430.48] that's people like in their coffee you
[426.96 - 432.72] add that in and then that plus the
[430.48 - 434.16] sodium that's additionally added you
[432.72 - 435.92] have yourself a coffee that becomes
[434.16 - 437.52] really addictive and so you keep on
[435.92 - 440.32] going to that coffee chain to that
[437.52 - 442.08] coffee place and you can do that you
[440.32 - 443.56] know for a lifetime I mean you can go to
[442.08 - 445.24] the same coffee chain for a lifetime
[443.56 - 449.00] because of it and people say I like that
[445.24 - 450.92] coffee so it's the sodium in that you
[449.00 - 453.56] know in that coffee you're drinking
[450.92 - 456.24] that's really kind of makes it really
[453.56 - 457.92] kick in for a double addiction so not
[456.24 - 460.52] only do you have the caffeine addiction
[457.92 - 462.48] right there but you have the sodium and
[460.52 - 464.60] the caffeine combined surprise surprise
[462.48 - 469.80] surprise nobody knew that
[464.60 - 472.12] ha but yes it's true so it's sodium
[469.80 - 475.40] thrown in everybody's coffee that they
[472.12 - 477.12] buy at the coffee chains uh-huh so
[475.40 - 479.92] there's that one so let's go into the M
[477.12 - 481.60] MSG a little bit too okay yeast extract
[479.92 - 484.64] is being thrown in
[481.60 - 487.20] everything because it's another cheat
[484.64 - 490.16] way of getting sodium in there so you
[487.20 - 491.88] actually have a burst of flavor you can
[490.16 - 494.16] look at the package the package of the
[491.88 - 496.32] food the package of the can okay and
[494.16 - 499.36] you'll see a certain amount of sodium
[496.32 - 502.76] but yet it tastes so good it tastes so
[499.36 - 506.12] salty why why why a lot of times yeast
[502.76 - 508.48] extract is thrown in there but they
[506.12 - 510.68] don't add it they don't meaning they
[508.48 - 512.36] don't add that Sal salt level they don't
[510.68 - 517.72] put it to the ingredient list you see
[512.36 - 521.04] how it works 300 mg 300 mg of sodium one
[517.72 - 525.12] gram of Mill one gram of sodium two gram
[521.04 - 528.48] of sodium but yeast extract really
[525.12 - 530.24] potent form of sodium takes it to now Bo
[528.48 - 531.72] off the charts so there's a lot of
[530.24 - 533.36] packaged food and a lot of canned food
[531.72 - 535.00] and stuff even healthy stuff I'm talking
[533.36 - 536.60] about like organic or healthy stuff or
[535.00 - 538.80] all natural whatever you want to call it
[536.60 - 540.48] organic this that non GMO and you're
[538.80 - 542.20] like oh these these chips are really
[540.48 - 544.36] good this is really oh this is my
[542.20 - 545.92] favorite chip right here yeah oh let me
[544.36 - 547.40] look at the sodium honey we better look
[545.92 - 549.68] at the sodium are you getting too much
[547.40 - 551.72] sodium in you and it's like yeah it says
[549.68 - 553.84] 300 milligrams that's about pretty much
[551.72 - 556.48] the level I see another whatever you
[553.84 - 558.64] know and then but it tastes so good
[556.48 - 560.72] because the yeast extract is a whole
[558.64 - 562.92] another level of sodium that they are
[560.72 - 565.64] cheating people and people don't
[562.92 - 568.76] understand this and that's the thing you
[565.64 - 570.40] know like um these are hidden things
[568.76 - 572.12] that no one's talking about instead
[570.40 - 573.96] they're talking about other things
[572.12 - 575.68] medical medium brought to town over the
[573.96 - 577.28] years talking about the fragrances now
[575.68 - 578.92] they're talking about the citric acid
[577.28 - 580.64] now CU a medical medium they're talking
[578.92 - 582.36] about right they're talking about so
[580.64 - 585.00] many different things they're talking
[582.36 - 588.44] about the natural flavors now
[585.00 - 590.80] but yeast extract that's a whole another
[588.44 - 592.52] one so I want to get that out there
[590.80 - 595.16] because people need to look out because
[592.52 - 596.60] it's rocket it it's taken off and I want
[595.16 - 598.20] people to look out for their health and
[596.60 - 601.68] their well-being and that yeast extract
[598.20 - 604.76] is is toxic it's toxic not just because
[601.68 - 606.24] of the MSG which is one reason why it's
[604.76 - 608.52] toxic I mean they're actually selling
[606.24 - 610.88] MSG more than ever before now people are
[608.52 - 613.80] sprinkling that stuff looks like white
[610.88 - 616.28] asbest they're just sprinkling that
[613.80 - 618.40] stuff on everything you know MSG people
[616.28 - 620.52] are buying MSG MSG is good for you now
[618.40 - 622.20] it's like absurd it's insane but that's
[620.52 - 624.56] what I mean how do you heal chronic
[622.20 - 627.24] illness when so much is happening out
[624.56 - 629.80] there like this so so let's get into it
[627.24 - 631.72] a little bit more in the sod world the
[629.80 - 634.20] yeast extract is a hidden sodium right
[631.72 - 636.88] there you got to look out MSG natural
[634.20 - 640.20] flavor hidden sodium in a lot of
[636.88 - 644.04] situations natural and organic flavoring
[640.20 - 646.84] right sodium it's another level of it
[644.04 - 648.60] MSG another level of it and then it
[646.84 - 651.28] doesn't have to go on the package so you
[648.60 - 652.96] don't see it on the package instead but
[651.28 - 655.64] it's in there and you taste it and you
[652.96 - 658.20] become like a sodium demon like it takes
[655.64 - 662.36] over you that's like a literally an
[658.20 - 664.76] addiction and you know people have to
[662.36 - 666.48] deal with that I'm going to have a
[664.76 - 668.12] little sip of Lem mom tea and then I'm
[666.48 - 671.24] going to continue if you guys are okay
[668.12 - 673.60] damn so addictive right Kim
[671.24 - 675.60] exactly all
[673.60 - 678.40] right let's
[675.60 - 680.20] go talk about sodium deficiencies in
[678.40 - 683.00] people like they end up going to a
[680.20 - 686.80] hospital and they get their blood tested
[683.00 - 688.12] they're sodium levels are down and first
[686.80 - 689.32] of all there's a couple things to
[688.12 - 691.04] understand a lot of people go to thep
[689.32 - 692.80] hospital it's not because of a sodium
[691.04 - 694.96] deficiency but they don't know why the
[692.80 - 696.40] person's really struggling they don't
[694.96 - 698.16] know why the person ended up there with
[696.40 - 700.92] a fainting spell or whatever it is they
[698.16 - 702.36] don't know why the person ends up um
[700.92 - 703.96] they're not sure what's going on the
[702.36 - 705.16] person goes to the hospital not sure
[703.96 - 706.56] they having a heart attack they having a
[705.16 - 708.16] stroke what's wrong with them did they
[706.56 - 710.28] faint are they dehydrated right all
[708.16 - 711.80] these things that have to be checked out
[710.28 - 713.96] all the boxes have to be checked when
[711.80 - 716.52] people go to the hospital
[713.96 - 718.24] so what happens to a lot of people that
[716.52 - 720.32] get food poisoning or they get sick
[718.24 - 723.36] their sodium level strong drop their
[720.32 - 725.84] sodium levels drop and depending on what
[723.36 - 727.68] time of day and what time of night and
[725.84 - 729.36] so forth depending on what kind of
[727.68 - 731.16] stress they're under how hydrated they
[729.36 - 733.16] are depending on how much water they
[731.16 - 735.88] consumed if they're consuming too much
[733.16 - 738.56] water your sodium could drop if they're
[735.88 - 740.04] consuming too much water and they're not
[738.56 - 741.52] consuming enough like coconut water
[740.04 - 743.12] they're not having spinach soup they're
[741.52 - 744.92] not having enough celery juice maybe
[743.12 - 748.12] they're only doing 8 O 16 ounces of
[744.92 - 750.72] celery juice but it's not enough for
[748.12 - 753.00] what they might need but a lot of people
[750.72 - 756.00] out there just in the conventional world
[753.00 - 758.64] alone end up at the hospital with low
[756.00 - 760.16] sodium and a lot of people end up in the
[758.64 - 762.48] hospital because they've had a stomach
[760.16 - 764.72] flu stomach bug or a flu or they don't
[762.48 - 767.68] feel good or covid or something and they
[764.72 - 770.40] they end up in the oh I said the word
[767.68 - 772.48] we'll see what happens they end up in
[770.40 - 773.56] the hospital and they do all these tests
[772.48 - 775.20] they're like what's wrong with these
[773.56 - 777.20] people and they find that their sodium
[775.20 - 780.36] might be low in that
[777.20 - 781.80] moment and um so they instantly go well
[780.36 - 784.36] okay we got to hook you up with a salt
[781.80 - 786.44] bag you got to get an IV bag got to get
[784.36 - 788.48] IV and you get the you know the the the
[786.44 - 790.32] salt bag is what they do they hook you
[788.48 - 792.08] up they bring your sodium levels up
[790.32 - 795.36] they're like okay we're we're good we
[792.08 - 799.64] brought your sodium levels up but people
[795.36 - 802.44] don't realize that one thing is sodium
[799.64 - 804.92] levels that the conventional medical
[802.44 - 808.60] model lives
[804.92 - 813.16] on is sodium levels that are determined
[808.60 - 817.28] from high salt diet for decades for
[813.16 - 818.36] decades in the last 60 70 80 years they
[817.28 - 823.64] been
[818.36 - 827.92] determining that salt level that number
[823.64 - 829.80] that they believe a normal human being
[827.92 - 833.80] should sustain or
[829.80 - 836.56] hold that number is too high to begin
[833.80 - 839.52] with in the conventional model this is a
[836.56 - 841.08] mistake made now you have to realize
[839.52 - 844.04] they' come up with a lot of different
[841.08 - 846.76] numbers throughout the decades one
[844.04 - 850.60] number back in the late
[846.76 - 853.00] 40s mid to late 40s was B12 so they were
[850.60 - 856.40] able to determine hey we can look at B12
[853.00 - 859.92] in people and said the 1950s and 1960s
[856.40 - 863.88] came along and it was all about B12 but
[859.92 - 867.52] they determine somebody's number but
[863.88 - 869.28] they don't realize in a B12 situation
[867.52 - 871.68] how life has changed the amount of
[869.28 - 875.40] stress people are under the amount of
[871.68 - 878.20] pollution people are under the amount of
[875.40 - 880.72] um radiation people experience would
[878.20 - 883.24] don't even realize it and you and here's
[880.72 - 884.64] a side note right here don't mean to go
[883.24 - 886.56] off a beaten path but you got to be
[884.64 - 890.32] really careful when you're hiking on
[886.56 - 892.84] trails and you're in in mountainous re M
[890.32 - 895.36] mountainous regions and stuff like
[892.84 - 898.04] that you got to be careful that you know
[895.36 - 901.04] there's a lot of testing that is
[898.04 - 903.20] occurred out there in different places
[901.04 - 905.60] in different lands and there's a lot of
[903.20 - 907.44] radioactive areas and you got to be
[905.60 - 911.04] careful because people walk right into
[907.44 - 913.72] radioactive areas and then you know 6
[911.04 - 916.24] months later 2 months later their nails
[913.72 - 917.52] are falling off their hands and they're
[916.24 - 919.12] having all kinds of different problems
[917.52 - 920.80] but that's another note I want to talk
[919.12 - 922.88] about because it's happening more often
[920.80 - 926.00] than people know all right so you guys
[922.88 - 928.16] coming on here I'm making spinach soup
[926.00 - 930.52] mhm we're talking about a lot of
[928.16 - 933.32] information right here here we're

[1103.92 - 1109.28] Spotify and it is completely gone it is
[1106.88 - 1111.68] wiped out I'm going to talk about that
[1109.28 - 1113.84] for a minute somewh over there in IG do
[1111.68 - 1117.24] you know that the medical medium podcast
[1113.84 - 1121.92] content on Spotify is no longer
[1117.24 - 1124.16] available yep I do know about it so do
[1121.92 - 1126.16] you guys remember a podcast episode I
[1124.16 - 1129.76] just put out pretty Rec recently do you
[1126.16 - 1131.28] guys remember the podcast that I put out
[1129.76 - 1134.04] it's about
[1131.28 - 1137.00] damaging and problematic
[1134.04 - 1139.76] supplements right one thing that has
[1137.00 - 1144.64] happened with medical medium for quite
[1139.76 - 1146.80] some time is I get attacked severely by
[1144.64 - 1148.00] Massive money-making Industries now I
[1146.80 - 1150.04] know a whole bunch of people are out
[1148.00 - 1151.24] there they're on social and they're on X
[1150.04 - 1155.04] and everything and they're trying to
[1151.24 - 1156.96] solve all these different injustices and
[1155.04 - 1158.44] health and everything else and I get it
[1156.96 - 1161.96] and there's a lot of different problems
[1158.44 - 1165.40] out there right but they're
[1161.96 - 1167.64] overlooking like other big problems that
[1165.40 - 1169.20] are causing serious serious problems
[1167.64 - 1170.96] with people they're overlooking that
[1169.20 - 1172.60] medical medium doesn't do that right I
[1170.96 - 1174.72] already broke all the information out on
[1172.60 - 1177.16] all the fragrances I already broke all
[1174.72 - 1178.48] the information out on that original
[1177.16 - 1180.16] information of when you go through the
[1178.48 - 1181.48] airports and your luggage goes through
[1180.16 - 1183.04] that you have to throw your luggage out
[1181.48 - 1185.08] after a certain amount of time so you
[1183.04 - 1187.08] don't have your baby or child just you
[1185.08 - 1189.00] know you know standing next to that
[1187.08 - 1190.84] luggage how it's loaded with radiation
[1189.00 - 1192.88] I've already done so many things right
[1190.84 - 1195.56] the blood draw I talked about the blood
[1192.88 - 1197.84] draw crisis I've I've put out things
[1195.56 - 1200.00] that are actually brain bending
[1197.84 - 1202.24] mindbending because it's just it's
[1200.00 - 1205.40] incredible information to educate people
[1202.24 - 1207.64] so they can heal information from s so
[1205.40 - 1211.44] right or how what I've never known of so
[1207.64 - 1214.20] much of it but what happened was I put
[1211.44 - 1216.36] out the podcast just like other podcasts
[1214.20 - 1219.72] that I put out and I I obviously pissed
[1216.36 - 1223.60] people off and I put out the problematic
[1219.72 - 1226.20] and damaging supplement podcast and you
[1223.60 - 1229.60] got to think about it there's a lot of
[1226.20 - 1231.84] money behind colostrum a lot of money it
[1229.60 - 1234.00] is an evil
[1231.84 - 1237.84] evil
[1234.00 - 1241.20] industry um evil for a lot of reasons
[1237.84 - 1244.04] and there there's a ton of influencers
[1241.20 - 1246.56] selling claustrum there is so much going
[1244.04 - 1248.12] on with claustrum Millions hundreds of
[1246.56 - 1251.56] hundreds of millions of dollars are
[1248.12 - 1254.32] being made off of colostrum and um I
[1251.56 - 1259.44] gave colostrum a real ass whipping is
[1254.32 - 1262.28] what I did and um and also charcoal
[1259.44 - 1264.00] activated charcoal Millions hundreds of
[1262.28 - 1265.80] millions of dollars into that activated
[1264.00 - 1268.16] charcoal industry a lot of people
[1265.80 - 1271.72] selling it a lot of influencers pushing
[1268.16 - 1275.36] it I gave charcoal an ass
[1271.72 - 1280.44] whipping and then then you know and then
[1275.36 - 1283.24] other things too also I did and ACV you
[1280.44 - 1286.80] know the ACV chewy gummies and all that
[1283.24 - 1289.08] I hit that one pretty hard and people
[1286.80 - 1291.48] that work in these
[1289.08 - 1293.12] these apps and in these companies you
[1291.48 - 1294.60] know they get they might have somebody
[1293.12 - 1296.84] invested in it and so forth that they
[1294.60 - 1300.04] might be invested in it and then
[1296.84 - 1304.16] boom there it goes gone you know the
[1300.04 - 1304.16] podcast is gone so for
[1304.40 - 1308.36] now and uh and I'm working on it so it's
[1307.32 - 1310.64] all
[1308.36 - 1313.32] good Denise says I thought gummy
[1310.64 - 1317.28] colostrum okay
[1313.32 - 1319.28] um terrible absolutely terrible so many
[1317.28 - 1321.28] people are duped I mean the Wolves
[1319.28 - 1324.84] pulled over their eyes on that one you
[1321.28 - 1328.48] want to get sick and sicker someday take
[1324.84 - 1332.08] colostrum you will get sicker and sicker
[1328.48 - 1335.04] it's it's uh really bad stuff I have
[1332.08 - 1336.32] a podcast coming out pretty soon talking
[1335.04 - 1338.12] about some different stuff and you'll
[1336.32 - 1342.88] you'll learn about it it's really
[1338.12 - 1345.64] scary yeah it says Apple podcast is that
[1342.88 - 1348.00] secure right Apple podcast
[1345.64 - 1350.64] also um got upset because of that
[1348.00 - 1353.44] episode so you know and so there's all
[1350.64 - 1356.20] kinds of triggers being pulled right now
[1353.44 - 1359.16] so bullets are flying I'm missing a lot
[1356.20 - 1361.72] of episodes right now on Apple because
[1359.16 - 1364.52] what happens is that medical medium for
[1361.72 - 1367.56] years has been exposing like the real
[1364.52 - 1371.12] evil right the real evil and
[1367.56 - 1374.44] so because of that I'm always attacked
[1371.12 - 1376.40] and just always all kinds of things like
[1374.44 - 1377.84] that and you guys know this I mean I I
[1376.40 - 1379.24] haven't talked too much about it over
[1377.84 - 1381.04] the years but I took a little bit about
[1379.24 - 1383.04] it
[1381.04 - 1385.12] right like for instance this whole
[1383.04 - 1387.16] sodium thing this will get me a bunch of
[1385.12 - 1390.52] crap too just so you know you don't know
[1387.16 - 1393.44] it but the whole throw salt and water
[1390.52 - 1395.84] thing is like a demon in the health
[1393.44 - 1398.68] movement just see now every trainer
[1395.84 - 1401.16] tells every single client throw salt in
[1398.68 - 1403.12] water every single bodybuilder throws
[1401.16 - 1405.36] salt in water every single health coach
[1403.12 - 1407.56] throw salt and water every s single
[1405.36 - 1410.68] naturopath chiropractor throws salt in
[1407.56 - 1412.52] water that's a demon in the industry all
[1410.68 - 1415.80] on its own like the crap I'm going to
[1412.52 - 1417.84] get for the talking about how that's BS
[1415.80 - 1420.44] to throw salt in water how it's
[1417.84 - 1423.04] problematic and there's and all kinds of
[1420.44 - 1424.56] things about it so but this is how it
[1423.04 - 1426.52] works I mean you know and you get
[1424.56 - 1429.24] original unique information from medical
[1426.52 - 1431.16] medium all these years when nobody was
[1429.24 - 1432.52] doing anything if you even go back five
[1431.16 - 1435.96] six seven years
[1432.52 - 1437.44] ago right8 years ago 9 years ago and I
[1435.96 - 1438.76] was publishing information that was
[1437.44 - 1441.52] mind-blowing people didn't didn't even
[1438.76 - 1443.88] know on any level so much of it's been
[1441.52 - 1445.32] poach and stolen but the point is is
[1443.88 - 1447.08] like what was everybody doing all they
[1445.32 - 1449.28] had was some eat better books out there
[1447.08 - 1451.40] it was like paleo books that was it just
[1449.28 - 1453.28] you know some eat better books was about
[1451.40 - 1455.64] it nobody knew anything about what
[1453.28 - 1458.36] caused illness sickness symptoms
[1455.64 - 1461.04] conditions true causes nobody uttered
[1458.36 - 1464.72] heavy metals it was just um it was
[1461.04 - 1466.56] ridiculous so so a lot of years I I put
[1464.72 - 1468.08] up with a lot throughout the years you
[1466.56 - 1469.12] guys have no idea how many times I've
[1468.08 - 1472.24] been a
[1469.12 - 1474.08] attacked and jabbed at and stabbed in
[1472.24 - 1476.16] the back and everything else because
[1474.08 - 1478.88] you're not supposed to do that you have
[1476.16 - 1480.64] to behave and you have to just you have
[1478.88 - 1482.64] to act like a Roman you have to be a
[1480.64 - 1485.28] Roman you have to behave you can't look
[1482.64 - 1488.20] out for the chronically ill God forbid
[1485.28 - 1489.92] you do something that's really for the
[1488.20 - 1491.88] chronically ill like really looking out
[1489.92 - 1493.56] for them stopping them from from
[1491.88 - 1496.00] saturating their intestinal tract and
[1493.56 - 1498.16] colon with with uh colostrum and
[1496.00 - 1501.24] charcoal stopping them from destroying
[1498.16 - 1503.40] their teeth and bones with ACV like the
[1501.24 - 1505.88] industries became monsters billion
[1503.40 - 1508.80] dollar in Industries so all it takes is
[1505.88 - 1511.96] me putting something out there and they
[1508.80 - 1515.72] still they still fear a little old me
[1511.96 - 1517.04] it's ridiculous all right let's go into
[1515.72 - 1518.60] sodium a little bit more and I'm going
[1517.04 - 1519.76] to be making a spinach soup in a couple
[1518.60 - 1521.36] minutes too which you see is this
[1519.76 - 1523.16] beautiful pile of spinach right here
[1521.36 - 1525.56] which I'm excited about I'm going to I'm
[1523.16 - 1528.80] going to like show you tricks on like
[1525.56 - 1530.76] making a really good spinach soup and it
[1528.80 - 1532.32] it has to do too with good oranges and
[1530.76 - 1534.04] good tomatoes but if you can't get good
[1532.32 - 1535.92] oranges and good tomatoes we can do
[1534.04 - 1538.16] something else but we can still make
[1535.92 - 1539.80] that spinach soup and get it to taste
[1538.16 - 1542.52] great in the whole
[1539.80 - 1544.12] bit all right so let's hit a little bit
[1542.52 - 1545.76] more in the sodium front there's all
[1544.12 - 1549.88] these hidden sodiums and then there's
[1545.76 - 1553.16] also techniques like putting sodium in
[1549.88 - 1555.64] water and drinking that in that fashion
[1553.16 - 1558.08] all the time it's not a great idea for a
[1555.64 - 1560.84] lot of reasons um you're salty when you
[1558.08 - 1564.76] put in water and you do it that way you
[1560.84 - 1568.24] salt your organs you can actually get a
[1564.76 - 1570.84] liver shut down or a case of
[1568.24 - 1574.96] pancreatitis if you salt your water too
[1570.84 - 1579.04] heavy just so you know you can put your
[1574.96 - 1582.80] liver in a catastrophic situation if you
[1579.04 - 1585.84] throw salt in your water yeah because
[1582.80 - 1587.76] what happens is it's a Mainline to
[1585.84 - 1590.68] putting salt into your liver it's
[1587.76 - 1593.88] different if you made a tomato sauce and
[1590.68 - 1595.40] Grandma threw some salt in it there's a
[1593.88 - 1596.36] big difference and still that's not the
[1595.40 - 1599.00] best thing in the world because
[1596.36 - 1601.24] everybody's so salted out but the point
[1599.00 - 1602.68] is when you salt water and you're
[1601.24 - 1604.48] somebody with chronic illness and you're
[1602.68 - 1606.28] just listening to some trainer out there
[1604.48 - 1608.20] whatever it is and you see them online
[1606.28 - 1611.12] you see them on social you see them on
[1608.20 - 1613.88] YouTube and you see people everybody I
[1611.12 - 1615.72] wasn't doing great until I put sodium
[1613.88 - 1618.40] till I put salt in a glass of water
[1615.72 - 1619.92] every single day and by the way go to to
[1618.40 - 1622.20] my website and you can buy my little
[1619.92 - 1624.40] sodium packs at the same time whatever
[1622.20 - 1625.80] it is the point is you can put your
[1624.40 - 1628.88] liver into
[1625.80 - 1629.88] catastropic shut down you can go into
[1628.88 - 1633.44] liver
[1629.88 - 1636.08] failure if you overs salt water and you
[1633.44 - 1639.20] don't have a meal around it you don't
[1636.08 - 1640.52] have food to try to uptake that sodium
[1639.20 - 1642.00] so you're somebody and you're working
[1640.52 - 1643.68] out you didn't eat anything that day
[1642.00 - 1645.16] you're intermittent fasting or something
[1643.68 - 1646.32] you're doing anything like that and
[1645.16 - 1648.36] you're sitting there and you're just
[1646.32 - 1650.00] throwing salt in water because somebody
[1648.36 - 1651.56] told you it's a great idea and you're
[1650.00 - 1652.92] training in the gym whatever it is and
[1651.56 - 1655.16] you're running on your treadmill I don't
[1652.92 - 1659.68] know taking a walk and you're just doing
[1655.16 - 1664.96] that you're damaging your liver that's
[1659.68 - 1664.96] what you're doing it's crazy all right
[1665.96 - 1670.80] so yeah all right and I see somebody see
[1669.40 - 1672.52] somebody popping up some certain
[1670.80 - 1675.32] influencer names and stuff like that
[1672.52 - 1677.92] through there and I just saw one that
[1675.32 - 1680.40] has stolen all my liver information in
[1677.92 - 1683.08] the just the last 3 4 years they they
[1680.40 - 1684.60] read Liver Rescue one that you you know
[1683.08 - 1686.60] think is a great person with a lot of
[1684.60 - 1688.48] Integrity I just saw that and that
[1686.60 - 1691.76] person I won't say their name that
[1688.48 - 1693.20] person hijacked half of Liver Rescue and
[1691.76 - 1695.12] then they were teaching it on their
[1693.20 - 1696.72] YouTube channel and everything else it's
[1695.12 - 1698.80] sickening and I just saw that person
[1696.72 - 1701.64] like hey yeah this person yeah that
[1698.80 - 1703.00] person took Liver Rescue information
[1701.64 - 1704.48] it's stuff I got to live with but
[1703.00 - 1705.88] whatever okay let's go back a little bit
[1704.48 - 1709.80] more into the
[1705.88 - 1712.44] sodium aspect of things it's key it's
[1709.80 - 1715.28] key to have sodium come from places
[1712.44 - 1717.76] where other trace minerals are attached
[1715.28 - 1720.88] okay so that means if you use a good
[1717.76 - 1723.32] sodium like sea salt right it's going to
[1720.88 - 1725.24] have other trace minerals if it's a high
[1723.32 - 1728.04] quality sea salt it's if it wasn't
[1725.24 - 1731.40] stripped it's going to have some trace
[1728.04 - 1733.56] minerals if you use a good rock salt or
[1731.40 - 1735.64] something like black salt it's going to
[1733.56 - 1738.20] have those trace minerals there right
[1735.64 - 1741.16] it's going to help but you still can't
[1738.20 - 1742.48] abuse that and throw that in water and
[1741.16 - 1744.16] that's what you're doing you're just you
[1742.48 - 1747.44] know throwing that water and sending it
[1744.16 - 1749.84] down you still can go into liver shock
[1747.44 - 1751.60] and shut your liver down for half a day
[1749.84 - 1754.12] and if somebody's really sick you can
[1751.60 - 1755.68] shut it down even longer and in
[1754.12 - 1757.24] eventually into liver failure if you
[1755.68 - 1758.80] don't know what you're doing and then
[1757.24 - 1760.04] nobody knows what happened to you you go
[1758.80 - 1761.88] to the hospital nobody knows what
[1760.04 - 1764.44] happened to you so that happens to
[1761.88 - 1768.40] people every day because of salt thrown
[1764.44 - 1770.80] in water okay so let's keep that in mind
[1768.40 - 1773.20] so even when you use these good salts
[1770.80 - 1775.72] like a good Himalayan rock salt like a
[1773.20 - 1777.76] good sea salt or a good black salt even
[1775.72 - 1781.04] if you use that you got to be careful
[1777.76 - 1784.56] and use them sparingly I'm not totally
[1781.04 - 1786.56] against those salts I'm not you can use
[1784.56 - 1788.88] a little bit even on medical medium
[1786.56 - 1791.52] dishes but you got to be easy on the
[1788.88 - 1793.56] sodium too you can't use a lot of that
[1791.52 - 1796.20] you blow out your pallets you'll blow
[1793.56 - 1798.76] out your your taste buds and you'll get
[1796.20 - 1799.56] you'll acclimate to an addiction level
[1798.76 - 1801.52] of
[1799.56 - 1803.56] acclamation and you'll you'll then
[1801.52 - 1805.36] you'll be like addicted to sodium and
[1803.56 - 1807.24] you won't be able to live without it
[1805.36 - 1809.56] when you're cooking or making your food
[1807.24 - 1811.96] or making your raw dishes you won't be
[1809.56 - 1813.56] able to live without it and what's going
[1811.96 - 1816.08] to happen is you're going to lose your
[1813.56 - 1818.32] taste to food you're going to lose your
[1816.08 - 1820.76] taste to other things and you won't be
[1818.32 - 1823.56] able to acclimate to those other things
[1820.76 - 1826.32] you need like parsley being heavy on
[1823.56 - 1827.64] parsley people are adverse to parsley
[1826.32 - 1829.12] they don't want to be they don't want to
[1827.64 - 1832.24] put lot of parsley in their food they
[1829.12 - 1834.52] can't handle it so in including like a
[1832.24 - 1836.28] lowfat dish or meal they don't want a
[1834.52 - 1838.00] lot of parsley do you ever see anybody
[1836.28 - 1840.76] put a head of parsley on a piece of
[1838.00 - 1842.32] salmon or a fish do you ever see that no
[1840.76 - 1844.32] they won't it's like a Sprinkle of
[1842.32 - 1846.36] parsley on dishes whether it's fish
[1844.32 - 1848.04] whether it's meat whether it's something
[1846.36 - 1850.48] else whether it's a steak whether it's
[1848.04 - 1852.52] whatever the sprinkle of parsley right
[1850.48 - 1854.68] somebody makes an egg omelette how much
[1852.52 - 1856.76] parsley is going in an egg omelette
[1854.68 - 1858.84] probably none really it's probably just
[1856.76 - 1860.16] a few like red pepper are put in there
[1858.84 - 1861.84] and a couple of other things right
[1860.16 - 1865.24] onions right in your in your egg
[1861.84 - 1867.20] omelette the point is leafy greens are
[1865.24 - 1869.48] not eaten enough and leafy herb greens
[1867.20 - 1872.84] are not eaten enough they're not in
[1869.48 - 1876.52] people's diets they're not there and we
[1872.84 - 1878.32] need those because those contain sodium
[1876.52 - 1881.28] but the right kind of
[1878.32 - 1883.56] sodium and we also need those because we
[1881.28 - 1885.28] need to acclimate to their flavors just
[1883.56 - 1886.60] like cilantro how many of you guys now
[1885.28 - 1888.76] have gotten a lot of metals out of your
[1886.60 - 1890.72] system you've also acclimate it to the
[1888.76 - 1892.68] flavor of cilantro you can only do so
[1890.72 - 1894.28] much and now you can do a lot of it you
[1892.68 - 1897.44] can only do a little bit now you can do
[1894.28 - 1900.16] a lot of it right the cilantro it's this
[1897.44 - 1902.24] is important to know and what happens is
[1900.16 - 1904.08] that if you overs salt everything and
[1902.24 - 1905.44] you're killing everything with salt
[1904.08 - 1907.84] you're never going to acclimate the
[1905.44 - 1909.28] foods that will be very important to you
[1907.84 - 1912.36] when you consume them on the right
[1909.28 - 1914.36] levels and the amount of you know of the
[1912.36 - 1916.44] amounts you need and that calls for
[1914.36 - 1918.52] spinach too if you're overs salting
[1916.44 - 1921.40] everything you're never going to enjoy a
[1918.52 - 1923.40] piece of spittage really truly enjoy it
[1921.40 - 1926.12] because that's where the sodium should
[1923.40 - 1929.24] come from same thing with celery as
[1926.12 - 1931.68] well so when we're overs salting our
[1929.24 - 1933.20] food with the good salt because that's
[1931.68 - 1934.84] what you're thinking too some of you
[1933.20 - 1937.28] guys because I know some of you guys are
[1934.84 - 1939.08] like I use the best salt you know I use
[1937.28 - 1942.20] I use the you know the best Himalayan
[1939.08 - 1945.28] salt I use the black salt I use the you
[1942.20 - 1947.48] know the the good sea salt from way up
[1945.28 - 1951.00] North I understand those are the ones to
[1947.48 - 1954.68] use but if you overdo it you're never
[1951.00 - 1957.28] going to acclimate properly to the foods
[1954.68 - 1959.96] that your body and your organs need and
[1957.28 - 1964.16] want you're never going to be able to
[1959.96 - 1968.24] acclimate to that spinach to that celery
[1964.16 - 1970.00] to those herbs to Lemon you're not going
[1968.24 - 1972.08] to be able to really acclimate in the
[1970.00 - 1974.36] places you need to do so which are
[1972.08 - 1977.60] critical for healing and here goes the
[1974.36 - 1980.00] next the next level the sodium in celery
[1977.60 - 1982.20] is not the same sodium that they're
[1980.00 - 1985.24] putting in all the food it's also not
[1982.20 - 1987.64] the same sodium as the rock salt and the
[1985.24 - 1990.04] good SE salt and the black salt is
[1987.64 - 1992.08] either it's they have a subgroup of
[1990.04 - 1995.44] sodium in celery I've talked about that
[1992.08 - 1999.20] sodium cluster salts okay it's not only
[1995.44 - 2002.72] a macro macro sodium is in celery which
[1999.20 - 2006.44] is the best sodium the best one not only
[2002.72 - 2010.72] a macro but a micro sodium in celery so
[2006.44 - 2013.08] the celery has a micro and macro sodium
[2010.72 - 2015.60] in it very important to know there's a
[2013.08 - 2019.04] reason for that right this is medicinal
[2015.60 - 2023.12] sodium this is a different kind right
[2019.04 - 2026.08] spinach spinach leaves spinach the plant
[2023.12 - 2030.28] the stems have also sodium in there as
[2026.08 - 2032.84] well now the sodium in spinach is bound
[2030.28 - 2035.56] so what the difference is it's bound to
[2032.84 - 2038.44] other minerals they won't
[2035.56 - 2040.56] separate they won't separate
[2038.44 - 2042.64] so what happens is when you take a rock
[2040.56 - 2044.84] salt Himalayan rock salt when you take a
[2042.64 - 2047.80] sea salt and you take black
[2044.84 - 2050.88] salt black Salt's a little different I
[2047.80 - 2054.52] like it I like it better in many ways if
[2050.88 - 2058.44] you take the Himalayan salt and the sea
[2054.52 - 2063.44] salt and you throw it in water the trace
[2058.44 - 2068.12] minerals don't stay bound they
[2063.44 - 2070.68] separate and they lose their viscosity
[2068.12 - 2073.12] so this is important to know when you
[2070.68 - 2075.08] have sodium coming out of spinach it's
[2073.12 - 2078.00] why it's one of the reasons it's so
[2075.08 - 2081.60] healing when you have sodium out of
[2078.00 - 2084.36] spinach in your diet in your bloodstream
[2081.60 - 2087.40] it stays bonded to certain trace
[2084.36 - 2091.00] minerals which makes that sodium last
[2087.40 - 2093.44] longer in your system and not a flash in
[2091.00 - 2094.88] the pan and then boom it's in your organ
[2093.44 - 2097.96] and that's it so here's the key right
[2094.88 - 2100.80] here big one right here when you're do
[2097.96 - 2104.28] sodium in the water like a good salt
[2100.80 - 2107.52] that I talked about rock salt sea salt
[2104.28 - 2110.68] okay it's a flash in the pan in your
[2107.52 - 2112.92] bloodstream it's like treating something
[2110.68 - 2115.60] with medications
[2112.92 - 2118.80] conventionally that's what it is it's
[2115.60 - 2119.64] like treating something conventionally
[2118.80 - 2121.36] with
[2119.64 - 2124.72] medications
[2121.36 - 2127.84] right keep that in mind it's not the
[2124.72 - 2130.00] Deep rooted Long Haul of fixing things
[2127.84 - 2134.96] and healing things it's the conventional
[2130.00 - 2138.28] model mindset you put salt in there it's
[2134.96 - 2141.20] in your bloodstream and gone it's a
[2138.28 - 2144.28] shining star and then it burns
[2141.20 - 2148.48] out understand that this is a big
[2144.28 - 2150.64] one so people are getting salt hits and
[2148.48 - 2153.36] that's what happens with yeast extract
[2150.64 - 2156.28] and natural flavoring those are msgs
[2153.36 - 2159.56] those are salts salt
[2156.28 - 2163.80] hits so you're getting these quick you
[2159.56 - 2166.84] know these quick highs like salt drug
[2163.80 - 2168.36] highs you guys see what I'm saying so
[2166.84 - 2170.00] what happens is when your trainer's like
[2168.36 - 2172.72] yeah you just put salt in water that's
[2170.00 - 2174.44] what you need to do get the good salt
[2172.72 - 2176.68] you know make sure it's the rock salt or
[2174.44 - 2179.04] whatever Himalayan and you do that and
[2176.68 - 2181.76] you're getting a quick hit so you're
[2179.04 - 2184.48] getting what's called like a salt High
[2181.76 - 2188.20] it only sits in your bloodstream for a
[2184.48 - 2190.84] certain amount of time gets discarded or
[2188.20 - 2192.80] a hunk of it gets buried and
[2190.84 - 2194.12] crystallizes so what's happening to a
[2192.80 - 2196.52] lot of people's brains is they're
[2194.12 - 2201.16] getting crystallizations from salt
[2196.52 - 2202.76] deposits in their brains namely MSG is
[2201.16 - 2206.92] one of them or
[2202.76 - 2209.76] MSG bound to other
[2206.92 - 2214.48] salts so what happens is
[2209.76 - 2217.32] that sodium can build up over time
[2214.48 - 2221.12] Harbor a nice safe haven in your brain
[2217.32 - 2223.76] or brain stem and become crystallized as
[2221.12 - 2226.68] the years go on and you can literally
[2223.76 - 2229.96] have these salt deposits in your brain
[2226.68 - 2231.76] that MRIs will be able to detect as
[2229.96 - 2234.36] years go on and you're getting older and
[2231.76 - 2238.32] older and they're just going to say Mrs
[2234.36 - 2243.12] Smith you have Alzheimer's really you
[2238.32 - 2244.48] got Metals salt deposits scar tissue and
[2243.12 - 2245.96] all kinds of other things growing in
[2244.48 - 2248.24] there so you want to minimize whatever
[2245.96 - 2250.60] can grow in your head Dr Fawn right
[2248.24 - 2253.28] there blood tests change dayto day just
[2250.60 - 2256.04] because it's low in serum doesn't mean
[2253.28 - 2259.00] it's an accurate reading correct of
[2256.04 - 2261.64] what's in the cell even if you use
[2259.00 - 2264.16] Spectra cell or other nutritional
[2261.64 - 2265.84] analysis I agree that's actually really
[2264.16 - 2268.92] good that's really good thank you Dr
[2265.84 - 2271.12] Fawn MD amazing doctor and that's
[2268.92 - 2273.56] actually um amazing information thank
[2271.12 - 2275.92] you for bringing that to our
[2273.56 - 2278.56] attention which takes me to another area
[2275.92 - 2282.36] I want to go really quick which is is
[2278.56 - 2286.72] okay the reading the salt reading in
[2282.36 - 2291.68] your blood work in your blood test okay
[2286.72 - 2295.64] salt reading should be lower than it is
[2291.68 - 2300.04] is what it should be they have it on the
[2295.64 - 2303.72] modern world's salt level the modern era
[2300.04 - 2307.80] salt level they have it in the 1950s
[2303.72 - 2311.24] spectrum of where sodium should be with
[2307.80 - 2317.28] everybody had the salt shaker and every
[2311.24 - 2321.92] single meal was salted heavily with not
[2317.28 - 2326.72] Himalayan rock salt not pink rock
[2321.92 - 2330.32] salt not black salt not sea salt
[2326.72 - 2332.08] everybody's Shaker had the road salt in
[2330.32 - 2335.48] it the
[2332.08 - 2338.52] 1950s is the stat they use for how much
[2335.48 - 2341.68] sodium should be in your bloodstream
[2338.52 - 2345.68] that's what they determin should be your
[2341.68 - 2349.32] sodium level it was in in a day in an
[2345.68 - 2353.16] age of every single meal had a salt
[2349.32 - 2355.12] shaker at the table and every man salted
[2353.16 - 2358.36] the crap out of their food didn't matter
[2355.12 - 2360.96] what it was this is what happened okay
[2358.36 - 2364.08] doctors weren't like watch your sodium
[2360.96 - 2368.52] Mr Smith watch your sodium Mrs Smith no
[2364.08 - 2369.96] they weren't it was like that so it was
[2368.52 - 2371.80] everybody was salting the heck out of
[2369.96 - 2374.44] their food that's what they were doing
[2371.80 - 2376.44] that was the 1950s and it was the road
[2374.44 - 2379.48] salt and that's the measurement they're
[2376.44 - 2381.36] throwing on you today there it is they
[2379.48 - 2383.76] never adjusted it they never did the
[2381.36 - 2386.44] science to actually really determine
[2383.76 - 2388.68] what's good what's bad and so what
[2386.44 - 2390.52] happens is if you threw up one night you
[2388.68 - 2393.12] got a little food poisoning maybe you
[2390.52 - 2394.76] got like you know the neuro virus maybe
[2393.12 - 2396.24] you got the stomach flu something hits
[2394.76 - 2397.88] you you've been throwing up for a couple
[2396.24 - 2399.00] days you can't really hold food down you
[2397.88 - 2400.52] go to the hospital they're going to say
[2399.00 - 2402.24] it's your
[2400.52 - 2404.12] sodium they're going to say it's your
[2402.24 - 2405.76] sodium your sodium is low you're in
[2404.12 - 2407.28] you're in a sodium crisis this what it
[2405.76 - 2408.68] is say you're somebody with a
[2407.28 - 2410.24] neurological problem where you have a
[2408.68 - 2413.20] weak neurological system and you're
[2410.24 - 2415.72] having a flare up or you're have you're
[2413.20 - 2417.24] you're partially dehydrated you don't
[2415.72 - 2419.08] have enough glucose to your nervous
[2417.24 - 2420.72] system and you end up in the hospital
[2419.08 - 2422.64] that night because your husband brought
[2420.72 - 2424.52] you in and you're going into the
[2422.64 - 2426.68] hospital again because you can't really
[2424.52 - 2428.32] feel your arms well that it's not a
[2426.68 - 2430.00] stroke you been down this road you had
[2428.32 - 2431.44] every test they think it's multiple
[2430.00 - 2432.84] sceris they don't know what it is you're
[2431.44 - 2435.04] back in the hospital they're going to
[2432.84 - 2436.24] say ma'am your sodium's low and that's
[2435.04 - 2437.68] why you're dealing with this your
[2436.24 - 2441.16] sodium's low and that's what they're
[2437.68 - 2442.64] going to tell you that's how it rolls so
[2441.16 - 2445.44] keep that in
[2442.64 - 2448.32] mind if you're if especially if you're
[2445.44 - 2450.76] not able to get what you need in in you
[2448.32 - 2453.12] it's another thing your sodium is low
[2450.76 - 2456.08] back in the 1950s the TV dinners were
[2453.12 - 2458.36] born the TV dinners were so high in salt
[2456.08 - 2460.60] it was off the charts everybody was
[2458.36 - 2464.12] saturated in salt in the 1950s that's
[2460.60 - 2466.96] the test they use still to this day and
[2464.12 - 2468.96] that's what's going on there all right
[2466.96 - 2472.36] how do you how do you actually sustain
[2468.96 - 2476.40] sodium so you're not having to rely on
[2472.36 - 2478.80] water and salt water and
[2476.40 - 2481.76] salt you have to bring enough sodium
[2478.80 - 2485.96] into your diet that naturally occurs in
[2481.76 - 2488.12] plants and herbs that is the key right
[2485.96 - 2491.16] here okay
[2488.12 - 2494.40] so in this glass right here I have lemon
[2491.16 - 2497.32] balm not particularly high in
[2494.40 - 2500.24] sodium I have honey in here
[2497.32 - 2505.00] too and I have
[2500.24 - 2506.36] water okay this is not a salty Brew in
[2505.00 - 2510.44] my
[2506.36 - 2513.00] hand all right if I eat a celery stick
[2510.44 - 2516.12] and drink some tea I'm bringing those
[2513.00 - 2519.28] sodium cluster salts into the mix into
[2516.12 - 2521.24] the bloodstream and it could sustain and
[2519.28 - 2523.28] sit in my blood for quite a while a lot
[2521.24 - 2524.16] longer than any kind of salt hit so if
[2523.28 - 2527.76] you
[2524.16 - 2530.16] take Himalayan rock salt or a sea salt
[2527.76 - 2533.32] and you throw it in
[2530.16 - 2535.88] here okay and mix it up it's only going
[2533.32 - 2537.24] to give you a quick hit that quick hit
[2535.88 - 2539.52] will be in your bloodstream for a very
[2537.24 - 2542.76] short time any excess will either be
[2539.52 - 2546.60] urinated out or will go into your liver
[2542.76 - 2549.12] or in another organ eventually for
[2546.60 - 2551.36] storage it may never come back
[2549.12 - 2554.00] out keep that in
[2551.36 - 2555.84] mind when you're doing something like
[2554.00 - 2558.80] healing tools like the medical medum
[2555.84 - 2560.56] spinach soup something changes it's also
[2558.80 - 2562.60] addicting so it makes you feel good for
[2560.56 - 2565.64] a minute and then makes you feel like
[2562.60 - 2568.08] you need more salt is really highly
[2565.64 - 2571.24] addictive so that's another thing too
[2568.08 - 2574.60] and like I said your acclamation drops
[2571.24 - 2577.68] for things that you need salt from and
[2574.60 - 2579.44] it raises from for chips and stuff like
[2577.68 - 2582.72] that okay so let's hit
[2579.44 - 2583.96] that why are you addicted to chips how
[2582.72 - 2585.44] many of you guys I want to ask you this

[2658.40 - 2662.68] brand name of chips whoa you guys are
[2660.72 - 2664.60] all doing that chip no wonder why it's
[2662.68 - 2668.00] sold for $1.2

[2668.00 - 2673.84] billion you guys are eating all that
[2670.60 - 2675.96] company's chips
[2673.84 - 2679.12] amazing all right
[2675.96 - 2680.60] so all right so here's what happened so
[2679.12 - 2683.08] you're not doing your spinach soup
[2680.60 - 2685.84] you're doing chips that's what's going
[2683.08 - 2688.88] on all right all right all right there's
[2685.84 - 2691.84] no shaming here and there's no judgment
[2688.88 - 2694.72] I understand life is hard and I
[2691.84 - 2697.84] understand getting a nice bag of what
[2694.72 - 2700.92] seems to be a healthier chip salty and
[2697.84 - 2702.72] crunchy completely understand
[2700.92 - 2705.48] okay
[2702.72 - 2708.12] yeah yeah I mean it it it's a higher
[2705.48 - 2710.20] quality right a higher quality sea salt
[2708.12 - 2711.76] is usually added to like better stuff
[2710.20 - 2714.32] out there you'll see sea salt you'll
[2711.76 - 2717.00] hear that so I want I want everybody to
[2714.32 - 2718.52] know it's okay to use a little bit of
[2717.00 - 2720.28] salt if you want to use a little bit of
[2718.52 - 2723.20] salt it's okay to use a little bit of a
[2720.28 - 2727.48] high quality himalay uh rock salt or a
[2723.20 - 2729.84] sea salt okay so like the meals the
[2727.48 - 2732.24] medical medium meals at Cafe Gratitude
[2729.84 - 2734.84] on October 15th they're easy on the salt
[2732.24 - 2738.40] and they use a really high quality sea
[2734.84 - 2740.96] salt okay but remember it's not thrown
[2738.40 - 2743.44] in water and just thrown in water plus
[2740.96 - 2746.88] they're easy on it so I like a little
[2743.44 - 2749.32] bit of that here and there okay and I
[2746.88 - 2751.96] like that but what happens is that
[2749.32 - 2754.12] restaurants put a ton of salt in stuff I
[2751.96 - 2757.12] mean they just put grams and grams and
[2754.12 - 2758.96] grams of salt in stuff and those crunchy
[2757.12 - 2760.24] chips Yep they're they're going to be
[2758.96 - 2762.72] salty and they're going to have that
[2760.24 - 2765.68] edge so here's the key what has you
[2762.72 - 2769.56] coming back for those chips so you stay
[2765.68 - 2772.68] addicted is the salt the salt content
[2769.56 - 2774.24] keep that in mind along with stuff like
[2772.68 - 2776.24] yeast extract in a lot of those
[2774.24 - 2777.64] different chips along with natural
[2776.24 - 2780.08] flavors in a lot of those different
[2777.64 - 2783.72] chips all different forms of sodium
[2780.08 - 2786.40] thrown in there okay and MSG and so
[2783.72 - 2789.08] forth so that keeps you going it's this
[2786.40 - 2790.60] addiction to Salt that's a big part of
[2789.08 - 2793.92] what it is so you're going to want to go
[2790.60 - 2797.28] and get those chips cuz you want that
[2793.92 - 2800.48] salt if you don't have salt on those
[2797.28 - 2802.84] chips you will not be eating them I
[2800.48 - 2805.80] promise you this if they were
[2802.84 - 2808.64] saltless you would have three chips a
[2805.80 - 2810.88] week at best and you'd be looking for
[2808.64 - 2812.40] salt from something else to to dip the
[2810.88 - 2815.40] chip in something
[2812.40 - 2817.36] salty so you got to understand it is the
[2815.40 - 2820.16] salt that you're addicted to
[2817.36 - 2822.60] and that salt over time with on that
[2820.16 - 2825.40] level builds up in our organs and so
[2822.60 - 2830.12] forth but it also knocks your ability
[2825.40 - 2832.68] away your natural ability to gravitate
[2830.12 - 2835.48] and consume things like the spinach
[2832.68 - 2839.96] right here it takes
[2835.48 - 2842.08] away your natural like pallet and your
[2839.96 - 2844.00] body's natural connection to something
[2842.08 - 2845.52] like spinach instead you're going to
[2844.00 - 2850.72] hear something out there spinach is bad
[2845.52 - 2853.20] for you Ates aoic acid that's not true
[2850.72 - 2855.36] that's not true and this is a raw
[2853.20 - 2856.92] spinach soup there's a big difference
[2855.36 - 2858.68] spinach is one of those things that if
[2856.92 - 2862.16] you cook
[2858.68 - 2864.04] spinach some tannins can come out okay
[2862.16 - 2866.64] and that could be that that could be you
[2864.04 - 2868.48] know one thing too it happens when you
[2866.64 - 2870.64] cook spinach a little tannin will come
[2868.48 - 2871.92] out it'll make it taste weird even
[2870.64 - 2876.12] slightly
[2871.92 - 2878.20] bitter when it's raw it is perfect
[2876.12 - 2881.00] absolutely perfect perect some are over
[2878.20 - 2882.80] there let's see I've been addicted to
[2881.00 - 2885.04] chips for my whole life recently I
[2882.80 - 2887.64] started having spinach soup and I don't
[2885.04 - 2889.72] desire chips as much is that a
[2887.64 - 2891.92] coincidence you're getting the right
[2889.72 - 2893.56] amount of salt from the spinach soup
[2891.92 - 2895.08] into your bloodstream and into your body
[2893.56 - 2897.40] and then you're intuitively connecting
[2895.08 - 2899.24] to all of that psychically intuitively
[2897.40 - 2901.92] all that you're connecting to that that
[2899.24 - 2904.08] whole thing and then it's making it so
[2901.92 - 2905.84] you're like I don't want those chips as
[2904.08 - 2909.84] much I don't want to eat those chips as
[2905.84 - 2914.32] much this inredible that is incredible
[2909.84 - 2918.40] okay so here's how the industries work
[2914.32 - 2920.96] salt something and you will be a buyer
[2918.40 - 2924.12] and consumer for a
[2920.96 - 2925.96] lifetime make the chip somewhat a better
[2924.12 - 2928.40] healthier chip so-called better
[2925.96 - 2931.16] healthier chip and salt the crap out of
[2928.40 - 2933.04] it and you will eat even more of them
[2931.16 - 2936.48] because in your mind they are a
[2933.04 - 2939.36] healthier chip so then you feel safer
[2936.48 - 2941.60] and better to actually consume that chip
[2939.36 - 2943.76] and you're going to be addicted to that
[2941.60 - 2945.72] chip because of the amount of salt on
[2943.76 - 2947.80] that chip and you are going to be a
[2945.72 - 2950.04] buyer of that chip for the rest of your
[2947.80 - 2951.44] life what that sodium is going to do
[2950.04 - 2953.52] over time it's going to build up in your
[2951.44 - 2955.68] organs and your liver and your brain and
[2953.52 - 2960.28] create problems another thing it's going
[2955.68 - 2963.48] to do it's going to stop you from making
[2960.28 - 2966.96] the connection you need to make to a
[2963.48 - 2970.88] medical medium healing tool or a a
[2966.96 - 2974.28] healing herb or healing green it's going
[2970.88 - 2977.36] to prevent you from acclimating to
[2974.28 - 2980.52] something that could save your life and
[2977.36 - 2982.28] return your health back and you'll be
[2980.52 - 2985.16] addicted to this other stuff that the
[2982.28 - 2986.88] salt's in you'll be prevent it'll be
[2985.16 - 2989.32] preventing you from actually learning
[2986.88 - 2991.72] how to consume the right kind of salt
[2989.32 - 2994.52] which is what you see in my hand and
[2991.72 - 2997.20] you'll actually you'll you'll pay for it
[2994.52 - 2998.28] one way or another as
[2997.20 - 2999.84] time goes
[2998.28 - 3002.72] on
[2999.84 - 3006.36] M God you guys are so addicted to
[3002.72 - 3009.12] chips totally understand not making fun
[3006.36 - 3011.40] of anybody here baby in over there it's
[3009.12 - 3014.80] like the more I put salt on my meals the
[3011.40 - 3017.96] more I have cravings for chips or
[3014.80 - 3020.48] something yes that's another thing too
[3017.96 - 3022.76] that's how you eat more chips so the
[3020.48 - 3028.64] thing is with chips eat chips to your
[3022.76 - 3028.64] sick eat chips to your sick
[3029.48 - 3035.32] the salt makes you want to eat the whole
[3031.84 - 3038.04] bag eat the crap out of them and then
[3035.32 - 3040.76] the next day eat another whole bag the
[3038.04 - 3043.28] next night another whole bag it makes
[3040.76 - 3044.32] you want more and more of it because of
[3043.28 - 3046.28] the
[3044.32 - 3048.80] salt
[3046.28 - 3050.12] yep all right rund down on sodium
[3048.80 - 3051.72] problems like I said I talked about
[3050.12 - 3055.28] before the conventional model for the
[3051.72 - 3057.64] blood test is wrong it was gauged on the
[3055.28 - 3060.16] 1950s when everybody body was using road
[3057.64 - 3063.36] salt and it was done that way and
[3060.16 - 3066.24] everybody had a salt diet okay we still
[3063.36 - 3069.36] have salt diets now better salts like I
[3066.24 - 3072.28] said are happening yes chips have oil
[3069.36 - 3075.56] too but try to eat those chips with just
[3072.28 - 3078.88] oil with no salt and you will not be
[3075.56 - 3080.16] happy you will be a miserable miserable
[3078.88 - 3083.48] consumer
[3080.16 - 3086.08] customer if you just have the chip with
[3083.48 - 3088.48] the oil on it a healthier chip with
[3086.08 - 3090.80] healthier oil on it maybe avocado oil
[3088.48 - 3093.12] whatever it is and you don't have the
[3090.80 - 3095.60] salt in there you will not waste your
[3093.12 - 3097.88] money on those chips anymore that will
[3095.60 - 3097.88] be
[3100.24 - 3105.40] that all
[3102.76 - 3106.76] right how come people have low sodium in
[3105.40 - 3109.04] many
[3106.76 - 3111.24] situations they have low
[3109.04 - 3114.44] sodium because they're not getting any
[3111.24 - 3117.68] of the correct vital real sodium they
[3114.44 - 3121.76] need to be getting from celery G juices
[3117.68 - 3125.04] from lemons yes lemons from spinach yes
[3121.76 - 3127.80] spinach even a cilantro has a little bit
[3125.04 - 3130.96] in there they're not getting it from
[3127.80 - 3134.84] Tomatoes tomatoes have a little bit of
[3130.96 - 3137.40] natural occurring sodium in it which is
[3134.84 - 3139.88] incredible
[3137.40 - 3143.56] tomatoes so these are things that are
[3139.88 - 3144.80] critical for people for their healing
[3143.56 - 3149.04] that's the kind of
[3144.80 - 3152.24] sodium that resets everything oh man I
[3149.04 - 3154.24] hate that word reset I hate that word
[3152.24 - 3157.08] everybody uses that word every time they
[3154.24 - 3160.12] think they got a new idea a new plan in
[3157.08 - 3161.92] health a new whatever it's like a reset
[3160.12 - 3164.72] a reset everybody want to sell sell us a
[3161.92 - 3167.20] new program reset reset meanwhile not
[3164.72 - 3169.52] really it's not really it's not really a
[3167.20 - 3173.04] reset not a real
[3169.52 - 3175.28] reset but good you know good marketing
[3173.04 - 3177.08] all right you guys let's start baking
[3175.28 - 3179.24] some spinach soup so much more to talk
[3177.08 - 3182.60] about sodium so the way you sustain
[3179.24 - 3185.56] sodium in your in your
[3182.60 - 3189.76] system
[3185.56 - 3191.60] okay is by getting sodium that's bonded
[3189.76 - 3194.28] and attached to other
[3191.60 - 3197.28] minerals it stays in the bloodstream
[3194.28 - 3200.84] longer and when it enters an organ it
[3197.28 - 3203.32] doesn't get dumped as trash meaning and
[3200.84 - 3207.32] piled in some corner you got to
[3203.32 - 3210.48] understand that sodium won't hold a bond
[3207.32 - 3213.96] when it's in sea salt like I said it
[3210.48 - 3216.00] won't hold the bond when it's in say
[3213.96 - 3218.52] Himalayan rock salt of some kind or pink
[3216.00 - 3220.92] salt it won't hold a bond long enough
[3218.52 - 3223.68] inside the body it's a quick fix meaning
[3220.92 - 3226.76] it's a quick hit is what it is it's a
[3223.68 - 3230.00] quick hit it won't hold the bond and
[3226.76 - 3231.96] when it won't hold the bond then it gets
[3230.00 - 3234.84] stored in the liver somewhere as a
[3231.96 - 3237.88] deposit of garbage stored in the brain
[3234.84 - 3242.08] as a deposit of garbage just like guess
[3237.88 - 3246.20] what MSG same thing
[3242.08 - 3248.88] stores and becomes garbage trash trash
[3246.20 - 3251.28] salt even if it was a great salt what
[3248.88 - 3253.44] I'm saying is if you throw it in water
[3251.28 - 3255.40] that happens if you use a little bit of
[3253.44 - 3259.68] the pink salt and a really high quality
[3255.40 - 3261.80] sea salt in your food I'm okay with that
[3259.68 - 3263.52] or should I say Spirit of compassion is
[3261.80 - 3265.60] okay with
[3263.52 - 3268.24] that because that's where I got that
[3265.60 - 3270.64] piece of information
[3268.24 - 3272.04] from got to get got to give Spirit
[3270.64 - 3274.48] credit
[3272.04 - 3276.44] sometimes ASO over there on YouTube
[3274.48 - 3279.20] spinach soup makes it so easy to get
[3276.44 - 3280.56] tons of greens exactly which is what
[3279.20 - 3282.20] we're going to do right now which I'm
[3280.56 - 3285.60] excited I have mine plugged in right
[3282.20 - 3289.84] here my machine I'm pumped up about
[3285.60 - 3293.28] this see I've cared myself and many
[3289.84 - 3296.40] clients from potato chip addictions
[3293.28 - 3300.80] using spinach soup and leafy greens they
[3296.40 - 3303.00] reduce salty crunchy Cravings
[3300.80 - 3308.32] boom
[3303.00 - 3311.24] boom amazing seriously really is all
[3308.32 - 3313.60] right this is how you hold your sodium
[3311.24 - 3316.84] it's bonded doesn't get thrown out like
[3313.60 - 3319.80] trash or stored in an organ like trash
[3316.84 - 3321.60] okay especially when you put like on
[3319.80 - 3324.60] like okay for instance when you put like
[3321.60 - 3327.84] a sea salt a high quality sea salt on
[3324.60 - 3330.96] food that's not garbage garbage food you
[3327.84 - 3333.20] put it on food like this or food like
[3330.96 - 3335.20] you know like a medical medium potato
[3333.20 - 3337.72] salad or something and you put it on
[3335.20 - 3340.56] that kind of food it's different you can
[3337.72 - 3343.00] get away with it you can use it that's
[3340.56 - 3344.96] why at Cafe Gratitude we're using some
[3343.00 - 3348.84] we we're staying easy on it which is
[3344.96 - 3350.28] incredible but we're using some it works
[3348.84 - 3352.00] but you don't want to be putting it in
[3350.28 - 3353.40] throwing it in your water like your
[3352.00 - 3354.92] trainer's telling you and you're
[3353.40 - 3357.16] guzzling it down and you think you're
[3354.92 - 3358.64] doing your body good your your Skin's
[3357.16 - 3360.80] going to turn to crap down the road
[3358.64 - 3362.16] you're going to dehydrate your Derma
[3360.80 - 3364.28] it's going to be it's going to be a
[3362.16 - 3365.80] quick hit in your bloodstream then gone
[3364.28 - 3368.20] it's going to store in your brain and
[3365.80 - 3370.72] liver that's a different
[3368.20 - 3373.24] story and then when you do things like
[3370.72 - 3376.04] this the spinach you're bonding that
[3373.24 - 3379.48] sodium to minerals they stay in your
[3376.04 - 3382.88] bloodstream and they regulate they
[3379.48 - 3386.40] regulate that's what I needed to say
[3382.88 - 3388.88] this whole time
[3386.40 - 3391.04] sodium from the celery sodium from the
[3388.88 - 3393.88] spinach regulat so what I'm going to do
[3391.04 - 3395.96] is I'm just GNA to just knock this down
[3393.88 - 3397.96] a little bit I want a lot in here so I
[3395.96 - 3400.92] want to show you guys what I
[3397.96 - 3403.16] do okay someone might just do that and
[3400.92 - 3405.80] that's all they do they put like a cup
[3403.16 - 3408.12] in there couple of Cups I'm going to put
[3405.80 - 3410.52] more now it's not crushed and chopped
[3408.12 - 3413.08] finely and put into like um measuring
[3410.52 - 3418.24] cup but what I want to do is I'm putting
[3413.08 - 3418.24] a lot in here I'm making a thick one
[3418.36 - 3423.36] like kind of like a dip so it isn't
[3420.52 - 3426.12] going to be a real liquidy spinach soup
[3423.36 - 3427.76] it's going to be like a thick dip okay
[3426.12 - 3431.32] and I'm not putting anything else in
[3427.76 - 3433.92] here yet so keep that in mind all
[3431.32 - 3435.72] right putting some more spinach in here
[3433.92 - 3438.60] like this look how much I got going on
[3435.72 - 3441.32] in here look at
[3438.60 - 3444.32] that half of a big
[3441.32 - 3446.28] container and I'm using a food processor
[3444.32 - 3448.24] now you can make it your consistency
[3446.28 - 3450.48] want with the food processor you can
[3448.24 - 3451.96] actually pulse it like I'm doing see
[3450.48 - 3454.92] right
[3451.96 - 3457.28] there okay so I got a decent amount of
[3454.92 - 3459.76] spinach in there and I can get more in
[3457.28 - 3461.16] there too I'm not going to put a lot of
[3459.76 - 3462.92] celery in here that's why the recipe
[3461.16 - 3464.44] doesn't call it calls for like one stick
[3462.92 - 3467.16] a half a stick you can do a quarter
[3464.44 - 3469.32] stick I'm just going to do um a quarter
[3467.16 - 3472.04] of a stick it's extra sodium it's a
[3469.32 - 3473.76] different variety of sodium so you're
[3472.04 - 3476.24] looking at two different kinds of sodium
[3473.76 - 3478.28] right here you're looking at celery
[3476.24 - 3480.48] sodium you're looking at spinach
[3478.28 - 3482.44] sodium I'm going to put a little bit of
[3480.48 - 3484.20] Basil in here not a lot but I'm going to
[3482.44 - 3486.28] put you can put more in if you want I'm
[3484.20 - 3489.84] going to throw some basil in here to
[3486.28 - 3494.56] give it a little bit of a twist into it
[3489.84 - 3496.20] there okay all right
[3494.56 - 3498.64] tomatoes
[3496.20 - 3501.16] so you know two three mediumsized
[3498.64 - 3502.52] tomatoes are great you can do a little
[3501.16 - 3507.52] less if you really wanted to a little
[3502.52 - 3507.52] bit more there's sodium in tomatoes
[3508.00 - 3511.96] there is sodium in
[3512.04 - 3520.72] tomatoes yes different form of
[3516.44 - 3522.40] sodium these all hold a bond and as they
[3520.72 - 3525.64] hold a
[3522.40 - 3527.88] bond you're going to have a regulation
[3525.64 - 3530.36] of sodium in your bloodstream so you're
[3527.88 - 3532.76] not you don't become an addict you don't
[3530.36 - 3535.24] become a sodium crack addict cuz that's
[3532.76 - 3537.24] what happens sometimes it can be hard to
[3535.24 - 3539.24] get good taste T ing Tomatoes I want to
[3537.24 - 3540.92] head into that field right now okay I
[3539.24 - 3543.16] got to tell you guys something you get a
[3540.92 - 3545.20] sweeter tomato like an heirloom tomato
[3543.16 - 3547.84] spinach soup tastes extraordinary out of
[3545.20 - 3551.24] this world if you get a tomato that's
[3547.84 - 3553.32] sweet and it's not so acidy the Tomato
[3551.24 - 3556.24] the the spinach soup tastes absolutely
[3553.32 - 3558.80] incredible okay these aren't really that
[3556.24 - 3560.76] acidy they're on the sweeter side this
[3558.80 - 3562.88] is a good tomato I'm using right now and
[3560.76 - 3565.32] when you use a good tomato boom you can
[3562.88 - 3566.96] just live off of this it tastes so damn
[3565.32 - 3569.16] good and if you're worried about protein
[3566.96 - 3571.00] oh my God my God my God the whole
[3569.16 - 3572.96] protein thing protein protein protein
[3571.00 - 3576.56] protein you're getting a lot of protein
[3572.96 - 3578.84] from your spinach it pains me to say it
[3576.56 - 3580.72] because honestly the whole protein scare
[3578.84 - 3582.72] and protein fear based crap that's
[3580.72 - 3585.00] happening out there is unbelievable and
[3582.72 - 3586.24] ridiculous for a billion reasons and
[3585.00 - 3588.60] someday we're going to explore all of
[3586.24 - 3590.08] them but the point is is you're getting
[3588.60 - 3591.68] plenty of that if that's your if that's
[3590.08 - 3594.08] your stuff you know that's your thing
[3591.68 - 3596.44] okay so I got a um orange right here
[3594.08 - 3599.80] another key
[3596.44 - 3601.92] if you get a good orange a sweet orange
[3599.80 - 3605.68] one that's not that like you know what I
[3601.92 - 3609.24] mean like um sharp one that's not as
[3605.68 - 3612.72] sharp if you get an orange that's smooth
[3609.24 - 3616.44] and it's sweet and you have tomatoes
[3612.72 - 3619.60] that are sweet and also smooth not as
[3616.44 - 3621.32] bitey you can make this taste so good
[3619.60 - 3623.20] now if you if you can't do that and you
[3621.32 - 3624.80] got whatever tomato and that tomato
[3623.20 - 3626.80] seems really like kind of more unlike
[3624.80 - 3629.20] the you know acidic side where it's
[3626.80 - 3632.76] acidy even though it's an alkaline fruit
[3629.20 - 3634.68] even though if you get one of
[3632.76 - 3636.40] those then you might want to put a
[3634.68 - 3638.56] little honey in it so I got some honey
[3636.40 - 3640.64] right here so I can show you but I'm not
[3638.56 - 3643.60] going to need honey in this one I have
[3640.64 - 3648.68] great oranges sweet oranges orange
[3643.60 - 3648.68] season is in in the US is hitting right
[3649.76 - 3654.24] now right so I'm putting a little orange
[3652.28 - 3656.16] in here and here's the other thing if
[3654.24 - 3658.64] you put more orange in there you got
[3656.16 - 3660.52] more of a liquidy spinach soup you can
[3658.64 - 3662.96] customize it to your
[3660.52 - 3665.16] liking you don't have to have it where
[3662.96 - 3667.80] it's it's exactly a certain amount like
[3665.16 - 3669.72] I just put two oranges in here basically
[3667.80 - 3672.64] okay I'm going to add a little bit more
[3669.72 - 3675.96] spinach too now garlic if you're
[3672.64 - 3678.48] sensitive where it's too harsh for you
[3675.96 - 3680.80] try only putting a little bit I'm
[3678.48 - 3682.00] putting a small clove of garlic in here
[3680.80 - 3685.32] right
[3682.00 - 3688.08] now but one clove of garlic works in the
[3685.32 - 3690.32] spinach soup sou okay you really love
[3688.08 - 3693.44] garlic you're welcome to put more if you
[3690.32 - 3694.96] don't mind that garlic being Hot and Hot
[3693.44 - 3696.56] on your palet and everything if you
[3694.96 - 3698.64] don't mind that put some more in there
[3696.56 - 3701.16] I'm okay with that but I'm doing one
[3698.64 - 3703.84] clove of garlic doing a small clove that
[3701.16 - 3707.52] was small okay and
[3703.84 - 3711.72] then all right I got everything in here
[3707.52 - 3711.72] I'm blending It Up This Is A thick
[3714.20 - 3718.44] one and guess what I'm doing would you
[3716.60 - 3722.60] believe it I'm adding the rest of the
[3718.44 - 3725.68] spinach I'm making this a really really
[3722.60 - 3730.36] thick spinach soup so good when it's
[3725.68 - 3732.32] like that so good look at that right
[3730.36 - 3734.28] there you want to put a little more
[3732.32 - 3736.96] orange in there you can a little bit
[3734.28 - 3738.92] more garlic you can I put basil in there

[3939.52 - 3943.36] everything which people don't get in
[3941.00 - 3947.12] them they don't it's the combination of

[3947.12 - 3950.60] being all bonded and the different

[4136.04 - 4141.04] it's a bird over there in IG do you eat
[4138.28 - 4143.56] this warm or cold okay everything could
[4141.04 - 4146.40] be put in the refrigerator so it becomes
[4143.56 - 4148.36] cold I don't heat it up so it's not
[4146.40 - 4150.48] heated up it's not cooked this is a raw
[4148.36 - 4152.04] spinach soup but you can take your
[4150.48 - 4154.16] spinach out put it on the counter you
[4152.04 - 4155.68] can let it warm up room temperature you
[4154.16 - 4158.44] can put your tomatoes out on the counter
[4155.68 - 4160.24] let them warm up you can keep everything
[4158.44 - 4161.96] on your counter and let it warm up when
[4160.24 - 4166.20] you make it it'll just be room
[4161.96 - 4167.92] temperature that's the way I eat it
[4166.20 - 4170.04] can I have
[4167.92 - 4174.60] it
[4170.04 - 4176.80] see can I have it if I suffer from
[4174.60 - 4178.76] gout ask your doctor what's right for
[4176.80 - 4180.28] you but you better believe it I've had
[4178.76 - 4182.16] people I've known in my life and so
[4180.28 - 4183.24] forth they're doing spinach soup for
[4182.16 - 4186.04] their
[4183.24 - 4190.00] gout just don't do your spinach soup
[4186.04 - 4192.36] with a big fat steak cuz if you got Gout
[4190.00 - 4194.48] and and and I'm not making fun of meat
[4192.36 - 4196.88] don't do your spinach soup with a big
[4194.48 - 4199.44] pile of beans either and don't do your
[4196.88 - 4201.36] spinach soup with a big pile of nuts if
[4199.44 - 4203.36] you got Gout you don't want to be eating
[4201.36 - 4206.00] a lot of protein if you eat a lot of
[4203.36 - 4207.40] dense protein like animal protein which
[4206.00 - 4208.88] doesn't mean that's the protein that
[4207.40 - 4212.08] works whatever but the point is if
[4208.88 - 4215.20] you're doing any kind of protein a high
[4212.08 - 4216.76] protein spinach protein much different
[4215.20 - 4219.00] it's a different kind of protein but if
[4216.76 - 4220.44] you do like a whole bunch of bean
[4219.00 - 4223.40] protein where you're just doing a big
[4220.44 - 4226.40] pile of beans and you got Gout you might
[4223.40 - 4228.32] get in trouble if you do a big pile of
[4226.40 - 4229.88] nuts and you got Gout you're going to be
[4228.32 - 4232.28] in trouble you you'll get in trouble if
[4229.88 - 4233.92] you do a big pile of meat and you got
[4232.28 - 4235.80] Gout you're going to be in trouble so
[4233.92 - 4239.12] what I'm saying is yes a spinach soup is
[4235.80 - 4242.52] great for gout it's great for for
[4239.12 - 4246.00] everything and um it just is it's a

[4288.88 - 4293.44] that condition to months and months
[4291.40 - 4295.48] later with the spinach soup being one of
[4293.44 - 4297.12] the tools and one of the most important
[4295.48 - 4300.00] ones they were using at the time and

[4413.36 - 4418.08] different
[4414.36 - 4421.08] angles from the apps and everything else
[4418.08 - 4423.72] the different shutdowns and different
[4421.08 - 4425.16] censorship and remember when my T
[4423.72 - 4426.88] remember when Tik Tok I don't think you
[4425.16 - 4430.52] guys remember but I was heading up to
[4426.88 - 4433.12] like a million subscribers on Tik Tok
[4430.52 - 4434.80] and my Tik Tok videos were were in the
[4433.12 - 4437.28] millions of views we were getting the
[4434.80 - 4441.96] wor out about chronic illness and Tik
[4437.28 - 4445.88] Tok they got rid of the entire account
[4441.96 - 4448.12] and they didn't allow a way to reach
[4445.88 - 4451.00] them they did it so they didn't leave
[4448.12 - 4453.48] any data behind for me to ever contact
[4451.00 - 4455.76] them and when I F found finally found
[4453.48 - 4457.24] somebody in there they wouldn't help
[4455.76 - 4458.68] when I found somebody through somebody
[4457.24 - 4461.56] else and everything and they wouldn't
[4458.68 - 4464.84] help and then if I told you the rest of
[4461.56 - 4466.20] the story your mind would be blown what
[4464.84 - 4469.52] happen happened with that Tik Tok
[4466.20 - 4472.92] account with what they did your mind
[4469.52 - 4475.32] would be blown they purposely deleted it
[4472.92 - 4479.44] and then they waited exactly 6 months to
[4475.32 - 4482.40] the day before they changed the a guard
[4479.44 - 4484.64] that I was in contact with and when they
[4482.40 - 4486.84] changed that Guard the guard said
[4484.64 - 4489.68] exactly 6 months to this day we can't
[4486.84 - 4492.68] reinstate your account now someone was
[4489.68 - 4496.16] actually guarding over the six-month
[4492.68 - 4498.12] period so I couldn't get my account back
[4496.16 - 4500.64] talking about sick that's
[4498.12 - 4503.40] sick think about and I'm thinking about
[4500.64 - 4505.96] a lawsuit too for censorship on that on
[4503.40 - 4507.64] that one so I'm actually working on that
[4505.96 - 4508.92] and I'm preparing for possible other
[4507.64 - 4513.16] lawsuits
[4508.92 - 4515.88] too and we believe we have enough data
[4513.16 - 4518.28] and then some so it's just sometimes you

[4539.40 - 4546.52] okay all right so I was never a big one
[4543.20 - 4549.24] for drinking gallons of water a
[4546.52 - 4550.92] day you know what I mean like over
[4549.24 - 4552.92] through the throughout the decades
[4550.92 - 4555.04] throughout the health you know all these
[4552.92 - 4556.76] years of the health movement shifting
[4555.04 - 4559.28] and changing medical medium bringing
[4556.76 - 4561.16] information into the health movement 3/4
[4559.28 - 4562.64] of the health movement has been changed
[4561.16 - 4564.60] and shaped because of medical medium
[4562.64 - 4567.72] information the other quarters the same
[4564.60 - 4570.00] old BS but the point is is that in the
[4567.72 - 4573.72] health movement it was always drink
[4570.00 - 4575.88] water back in the 80s back in the 80s uh
[4573.72 - 4578.08] 90s drink a lot of water drink a lot of
[4575.88 - 4580.32] water and people just drank and drank
[4578.08 - 4582.28] and drank no results to all their
[4580.32 - 4585.96] conditions and symptoms but drank lots
[4582.28 - 4587.76] of water it was never one of those where
[4585.96 - 4593.68] you know you should be
[4587.76 - 4595.64] drinking you know 30 o of water um every
[4593.68 - 4597.52] half an hour I mean you wouldn't believe
[4595.64 - 4599.96] the advice I've seen out there people
[4597.52 - 4602.40] have you can drown
[4599.96 - 4604.24] yourself drown yourself your lungs can
[4602.40 - 4607.56] fill up with water your bloodstream can
[4604.24 - 4609.40] thin out too much with water so medical
[4607.56 - 4611.84] medium information was always about
[4609.40 - 4616.00] adding solids to water do you guys get
[4611.84 - 4618.00] what that is adding solids to it right
[4616.00 - 4619.84] adding lemon this isn't a lemon right
[4618.00 - 4626.48] here I can grab one really quick but
[4619.84 - 4631.12] adding lemon to your water lemon holds
[4626.48 - 4634.68] sodium it holds other solids
[4631.12 - 4639.80] calcium the minerals the metals soft
[4634.68 - 4642.44] Metals we need magnesium right so lemons
[4639.80 - 4646.04] hold these and so what happens is when
[4642.44 - 4649.16] you squeeze lemon in water you you just
[4646.04 - 4651.64] diverted a chance to
[4649.16 - 4653.80] drown doesn't mean you still can't drown
[4651.64 - 4656.00] yourself it you know with drinking too
[4653.80 - 4657.80] much water but you advert you completely
[4656.00 - 4660.52] adverted you you've diverted that
[4657.80 - 4664.24] possibility to happen easily so what
[4660.52 - 4668.56] happens is with lemon lemon in water it
[4664.24 - 4671.20] allows okay th that sodium to get to
[4668.56 - 4673.92] where it needs and hold and stay bonded
[4671.20 - 4677.56] with other trace minerals to keep
[4673.92 - 4680.56] electrolytes high so your water isn't
[4677.56 - 4683.56] thinning your bloodstream out
[4680.56 - 4683.56] empty
[4685.20 - 4690.08] empty so Spirit of
[4687.56 - 4693.04] compassion wanted people to be on lemon
[4690.08 - 4694.72] water because of flushing the liver of
[4693.04 - 4699.12] poisons and
[4694.72 - 4702.36] toxins flushing the body of poisons and
[4699.12 - 4705.28] toxins one of those ways of doing it is
[4702.36 - 4708.76] lemon has detoxification
[4705.28 - 4712.36] like detoxifying
[4708.76 - 4714.84] minerals that can help push out garbage
[4712.36 - 4717.92] junk and pull it out
[4714.84 - 4720.28] right if you're somebody who all they
[4717.92 - 4722.28] have is distilled water you have to add
[4720.28 - 4725.60] some trace minerals into that water you
[4722.28 - 4727.48] have to add lemon into that water at
[4725.60 - 4730.00] least lemon into that water so if you're
[4727.48 - 4731.64] a distilled water person now you're like
[4730.00 - 4735.40] You' got rid of all the
[4731.64 - 4739.00] solids okay r o reverse o mosis there's
[4735.40 - 4743.16] still solids in there keep that in mind
[4739.00 - 4746.64] most Ro systems leave some solids in the
[4743.16 - 4749.04] water distilled water
[4746.64 - 4751.08] distillers they get rid of all the
[4749.04 - 4752.92] solids and then you got and then you're
[4751.08 - 4754.60] drinking that water if you drink too
[4752.92 - 4756.04] much of that distilled water and you're
[4754.60 - 4758.20] drinking way too much of it now we're in
[4756.04 - 4760.16] a water topic I got to do I got to do
[4758.20 - 4763.64] another live on this maybe I'll do a
[4760.16 - 4766.04] podcast or something but you're drinking
[4763.64 - 4769.16] distilled water you can get in trouble
[4766.04 - 4772.96] because there's no solids in that
[4769.16 - 4775.24] water okay plus distilled water might
[4772.96 - 4777.60] take something from you that's good
[4775.24 - 4780.00] because you're using water you need you
[4777.60 - 4782.92] you have to have solids in that water
[4780.00 - 4785.00] it's critical so lemon this is this is
[4782.92 - 4787.00] medical M information just so you guys
[4785.00 - 4788.68] know and if someone's poached a tidbit
[4787.00 - 4792.28] here and there throughout the years
[4788.68 - 4795.52] there's nothing I can do but what either
[4792.28 - 4799.76] way but what I'm trying to say is
[4795.52 - 4802.52] that that the lemon water added to water
[4799.76 - 4805.96] makes it so you have less likely chances
[4802.52 - 4808.80] to drown in it you have also
[4805.96 - 4812.08] electrolytes staying keeping that water
[4808.80 - 4813.72] strong so that you don't collapse those
[4812.08 - 4814.84] neurotransmitters so if you're somebody
[4813.72 - 4816.56] that's chronically sick and you got
[4814.84 - 4818.20] neurotransmitter problems and you got
[4816.56 - 4820.84] neur neurological problems and you're
[4818.20 - 4822.72] not well your nervous system struggling
[4820.84 - 4824.32] and you're just drinking water and water
[4822.72 - 4826.40] and water it's not going to be a good
[4824.32 - 4828.00] thing you got to have you have to have
[4826.40 - 4830.28] water that has something in it solids
[4828.00 - 4833.16] like coconut water coconut water has
[4830.28 - 4834.88] solids in it so that's a whole point it
[4833.16 - 4836.48] has sodium in there it's got different
[4834.88 - 4838.76] minerals in there trace minerals that's
[4836.48 - 4841.20] what coconut water has naturally
[4838.76 - 4842.92] occurring same thing if you something
[4841.20 - 4844.68] similar is when you take lemon and you
[4842.92 - 4846.16] squeeze it in water you're doing the
[4844.68 - 4850.16] same thing you're putting solids back
[4846.16 - 4852.48] into that water but with lemon
[4850.16 - 4854.32] water you're actually flushing out the
[4852.48 - 4856.28] liver you're actually flushing out you
[4854.32 - 4857.68] know the body's organs you're flushing
[4856.28 - 4859.72] that junk out that's medical medium
[4857.68 - 4862.28] information I said a million times that
[4859.72 - 4864.24] I'm not the first guy or the first
[4862.28 - 4867.08] person on this planet that decided to
[4864.24 - 4869.56] cut a lemon and squeeze it in water I
[4867.08 - 4871.80] never said that in a million years
[4869.56 - 4875.28] because it's not true just frankly it's
[4871.80 - 4878.60] not true but medical medium information
[4875.28 - 4881.16] that I put out for these decades is that
[4878.60 - 4883.80] lemon water first thing in the morning
[4881.16 - 4885.76] is a flusher of toxins and poisons from
[4883.80 - 4887.48] the liver when the Li gathers it up all
[4885.76 - 4890.32] night long and it needs to get pulled
[4887.48 - 4892.56] out the lemon water does
[4890.32 - 4894.12] that and also bringing all the
[4892.56 - 4895.68] electrolytes back into the water that's
[4894.12 - 4899.32] also medical Med
[4895.68 - 4902.12] information bringing the solids back in
[4899.32 - 4903.60] like the calcium and so forth so that's
[4902.12 - 4906.28] why lemon water is so important with the
[4903.60 - 4911.08] healing process some people over drink
[4906.28 - 4914.00] plain water they over drink plain
[4911.08 - 4916.24] water and if you over drink it and
[4914.00 - 4919.56] you're electrolytes start
[4916.24 - 4922.44] dropping including sodium too
[4919.56 - 4924.84] electrolyte starts dropping it's one of
[4922.44 - 4927.08] the electrolytes potassium gets thrown
[4924.84 - 4928.76] off your sodium pottassium your glucose
[4927.08 - 4931.08] gets thrown off glucose is part of an
[4928.76 - 4933.64] electrolyte it becomes a part of an
[4931.08 - 4935.68] electroly Jackie my son drank too much
[4933.64 - 4939.48] water with friends one day and he felt
[4935.68 - 4942.44] nauseous and felt like throwing up he
[4939.48 - 4945.04] learned I think one of the most terrible
[4942.44 - 4949.00] things is like water drinking contests
[4945.04 - 4951.04] every five years they all forget that
[4949.00 - 4954.60] somebody died in the middle of a water
[4951.04 - 4957.40] drinking contest every five years and so
[4954.60 - 4960.68] there's uh you know
[4957.40 - 4963.96] hazing that's a prime example somebody
[4960.68 - 4965.92] died like 25 years ago from a hazing
[4963.96 - 4968.48] where it was a contest to drink the most
[4965.92 - 4971.88] water for a whole bunch of newbies at a
[4968.48 - 4973.80] fraternity and um you know some kid
[4971.88 - 4975.20] drown right in front of everybody and
[4973.80 - 4976.88] you can't save them they're drowning
[4975.20 - 4978.04] they're on the floor flapping around and
[4976.88 - 4980.56] then they're just they're
[4978.04 - 4982.24] drowning and you know this is just it's
[4980.56 - 4984.32] like every five years another person
[4982.24 - 4986.28] drowns from like a water drinking
[4984.32 - 4988.60] contest and I'm like what is going on
[4986.28 - 4990.12] here how come nobody remembers and
[4988.60 - 4992.44] nobody knows because that's what
[4990.12 - 4994.00] Everything Changes in three years and
[4992.44 - 4995.60] the same thing with all the influencers
[4994.00 - 4997.00] now and the podcast influencers and so
[4995.60 - 4999.08] forth the crap they were talking about
[4997.00 - 5001.36] three years ago two years ago four years
[4999.08 - 5003.20] ago is embarrassing having people do the
[5001.36 - 5004.96] worst things and now they change their
[5003.20 - 5006.84] tune and grab some good info from like
[5004.96 - 5009.00] mm or something and now they're changing
[5006.84 - 5011.04] it no one looks back 3 years ago and
[5009.00 - 5013.84] says Whoa you were saying that you
[5011.04 - 5014.76] really are like a shape shifter you are
[5013.84 - 5017.76] a
[5014.76 - 5020.64] chameleon and a carpet bagger celery
[5017.76 - 5022.48] juice for sodium incredible a lot of
[5020.64 - 5024.20] people are not consistent with drinking
[5022.48 - 5026.84] enough celery juice they only drink 8
[5024.20 - 5029.80] ounces or 6 ounces I'm not sh putting
[5026.84 - 5032.04] shade on that drink 2 ounces but their
[5029.80 - 5034.64] stress levels are going you know up
[5032.04 - 5037.84] their their adrenaline is pumping they
[5034.64 - 5039.68] need more more than just 4 ounces a day
[5037.84 - 5041.68] and quite frankly a lot of people
[5039.68 - 5044.04] there's you know they they stop drinking
[5041.68 - 5046.08] celery juice and they remember drinking
[5044.04 - 5047.96] it a year ago and they think they still
[5046.08 - 5051.56] drink it or something that's something
[5047.96 - 5053.84] that happens too people tend to remember
[5051.56 - 5056.48] their referencing in their brain a time
[5053.84 - 5058.20] when they drank a lot of celery juice or
[5056.48 - 5061.00] a time when they ate something really
[5058.20 - 5062.72] good but they haven't been doing that
[5061.00 - 5064.04] and they're dabbling you know dabbling
[5062.72 - 5064.84] and stuff they're dabbers right and
[5064.04 - 5066.96] they're
[5064.84 - 5068.04] dabblers and they're doing that but they
[5066.96 - 5071.12] they don't
[5068.04 - 5073.64] remember like yo you haven't drank
[5071.12 - 5075.68] celery in a few months you had one glass
[5073.64 - 5077.88] of celery juice a month ago you're not
[5075.68 - 5079.52] going to keep your sodium levels strong
[5077.88 - 5082.08] so you're going to be relying on
[5079.52 - 5083.08] addictive behavior you're going to be a
[5082.08 - 5085.40] salt
[5083.08 - 5088.04] addict a salt crack addict and you're
[5085.40 - 5089.60] going to be just doing that so it it's
[5088.04 - 5092.60] crazy that's what happens you guys and
[5089.60 - 5096.16] then next thing you know it you know and
[5092.60 - 5100.04] if they got weak adrenals uh
[5096.16 - 5101.60] yeah I know all right you guys there's
[5100.04 - 5104.60] so much to talk about I could sit here
[5101.60 - 5108.48] all day which I love to do I would love
[5104.60 - 5110.36] to do that and I love doing it but weak
[5108.48 - 5111.80] adrenals and sodium levels that's a
[5110.36 - 5114.68] question that comes up all the time so
[5111.80 - 5115.92] weak adrenals and sodium levels right
[5114.68 - 5117.96] just because you have weak adrenals
[5115.92 - 5120.24] doesn't mean that you're not going to
[5117.96 - 5122.44] have any sodium levels but if you're
[5120.24 - 5124.32] hitting your body with the quick hit the
[5122.44 - 5127.48] wrong sodium it's not going to help your
[5124.32 - 5130.04] adrenals keep that in mind right you can
[5127.48 - 5132.88] also cook your adrenals and salt you can
[5130.04 - 5134.28] pickle them understand that too so
[5132.88 - 5138.16] here's here's some bad information
[5134.28 - 5141.16] that's out there may as well talk about
[5138.16 - 5143.48] this here's some bad
[5141.16 - 5146.04] information your adrenals need salts
[5143.48 - 5147.76] your adrenals need salt you know
[5146.04 - 5150.20] trainers out there now health coaches
[5147.76 - 5152.64] out there graduating from whatever
[5150.20 - 5155.48] health coach act you know Acme health
[5152.64 - 5157.16] coach you know company in corporation
[5155.48 - 5159.16] and they're just stamping them out it's
[5157.16 - 5162.40] like you need salt for your adrenals
[5159.16 - 5165.88] sodium for your adrenals dude you can
[5162.40 - 5167.28] pickle your adrenals you can pickle the
[5165.88 - 5170.04]  out of your
[5167.28 - 5171.44] adrenals just for the record you can dry
[5170.04 - 5174.24] them up like little
[5171.44 - 5177.20] prunes if you overs
[5174.24 - 5179.24] salt if you overs salt this is like a
[5177.20 - 5182.16] new this is like a new Flash a
[5179.24 - 5183.96] bulletin if you overs salt you can
[5182.16 - 5185.96] pickle the out of your adrenals and
[5183.96 - 5189.24] turn them into little
[5185.96 - 5190.92] prunes keep that in mind need salt for
[5189.24 - 5192.12] my adrenals need salt for my adrenals
[5190.92 - 5193.80] you're killing your adrenals you're
[5192.12 - 5196.36] killing your adrenals need salt for my
[5193.80 - 5198.04] adrenals you're killing your adrenals
[5196.36 - 5199.72] and then it gets worse need more salt
[5198.04 - 5201.36] for my adrenals but your adrenals are
[5199.72 - 5204.12] being pickled and they're shriveling up
[5201.36 - 5206.24] and dying more salt for my
[5204.12 - 5208.68] adrenals ma'am your adrenals aren't
[5206.24 - 5208.68] doing
[5209.00 - 5216.68] good at the doctor's office naturopath
[5213.24 - 5218.16] kinesiologist acupuncturist MD whatever
[5216.68 - 5219.48] you're at the doctor's office your
[5218.16 - 5221.40] adrenals aren't doing good they look
[5219.48 - 5223.40] like they're getting worse iridologist
[5221.40 - 5225.32] whatever your adrenals are getting worse
[5223.40 - 5226.64] every you know it me oh more salt you
[5225.32 - 5229.36] need more
[5226.64 - 5233.60] salt and you're addicted to the
[5229.36 - 5233.60] Salt so you're misreading all the
[5233.96 - 5238.12] signs but that's the amount of stupid
[5236.20 - 5240.12] crap that happens in the health
[5238.12 - 5242.64] field and when you're sick and
[5240.12 - 5245.24] chronically ill it's the wild
[5242.64 - 5247.40] west you get too sick because of all the
[5245.24 - 5250.72]  out there to
[5247.40 - 5254.20] too it's really bad and that's why
[5250.72 - 5255.68] Spotify somebody in Spotify said just
[5254.20 - 5258.84] play a little joke on him let's take
[5255.68 - 5261.36] down his uh Spotify account especially
[5258.84 - 5264.44] when I'm talking about alkaline ionizer
[5261.36 - 5267.04] water machines and
