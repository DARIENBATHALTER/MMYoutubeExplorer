[248.24 - 251.28] worldwide right
[249.92 - 254.52] think about that
[251.28 - 254.52] how incredible
[255.76 - 259.20] so
[256.88 - 261.76] the medical medium books
[259.20 - 264.32] are the most selling books

[266.84 - 271.28] right and
[268.88 - 274.56] six and a half years running
[271.28 - 275.92] and there's a reason for that no pr or
[274.56 - 276.96] marketing guys do you know what that
[275.92 - 279.20] means
[276.96 - 282.00] no pr marketing it means i didn't take a
[279.20 - 283.68] million dollars
[282.00 - 286.72] like they all do
[283.68 - 290.32] and put it into pr marketing
[286.72 - 290.32] so that their book can get somewhere
[290.64 - 295.28] the books no money behind them
[293.60 - 297.20] no money behind the books being
[295.28 - 298.48] propelled out there right i'm gonna put
[297.20 - 299.76] this in the pan
[298.48 - 302.08] the books
[299.76 - 305.28] healed people
[302.08 - 305.28] they healed people
[305.84 - 309.44] people everybody deserves to heal even
[308.24 - 311.52] people
[309.44 - 314.72] who heal from medical medium and then
[311.52 - 316.72] give me a middle finger on the way out
[314.72 - 318.64] because they want to sell an alkaline
[316.72 - 320.80] ionizer water machine and the medical
[318.64 - 322.56] medium community says medical medium
[320.80 - 325.28] doesn't like those because the metal
[322.56 - 327.44] plates in there rot and bubble up and
[325.28 - 330.00] everybody gets poisoned and then because
[327.44 - 332.16] they can't sell their alkaline
[330.00 - 334.16] ionizer water machine to anybody they
[332.16 - 336.08] get mad and they say well even though i
[334.16 - 338.32] healed 100
[336.08 - 340.96] for medical medium information i'm gonna
[338.32 - 342.32] tell everybody
[340.96 - 344.24] forget it
[342.32 - 345.52] i'm out of here

[345.52 - 348.64] medium information you guys we're doing
[347.28 - 352.24] cooking tips and stuff what's funny
[348.64 - 353.20] about medical medium information is
[352.24 - 355.52] it's
[353.20 - 358.16] saved a lot of lives
[355.52 - 361.20] and i don't care who's live it's safe as
[358.16 - 363.44] long as it saved their life
[361.20 - 367.36] doesn't matter
[363.44 - 368.80] as long as their life is saved
[367.36 - 370.72] i don't care
[368.80 - 372.96] what they want to do or
[370.72 - 374.96] sell or
[372.96 - 377.12] believe in it's totally up to everybody
[374.96 - 380.24] to believe in anything they want do what
[377.12 - 381.92] they want everything
[380.24 - 383.20] i just want you better so you can do
[381.92 - 384.96] what you want in life whatever that's
[383.20 - 386.48] going to be so i'm doing a pan right
[384.96 - 387.84] here it's really exciting here with this
[386.48 - 389.52] cooking tips as we're going to be doing
[387.84 - 390.72] so i got the carrot so i don't know if i
[389.52 - 392.32] showed you guys this i'm going to show
[390.72 - 395.76] you one more time
[392.32 - 397.60] from here on up from here on up
[395.76 - 399.28] okay
[397.60 - 401.84] right there
[399.28 - 403.84] there's an alkaloid on that carrot
[401.84 - 406.24] nobody knows this they don't know that
[403.84 - 408.56] there's an alkaloid here inside that
[406.24 - 410.72] carrot and that alkaloid
[408.56 - 412.24] okay that alkaloid makes it hard to
[410.72 - 414.24] digest
[412.24 - 417.04] it's got enzyme inhibitors in that
[414.24 - 418.96] alcohol alkaloid right there so i chop
[417.04 - 420.72] the top of the carrot off because that's
[418.96 - 422.56] an enzyme enzyme inhibitors are in that
[420.72 - 424.08] part of the carrot give somebody a
[422.56 - 426.00] bellyache there's people that can't eat
[424.08 - 429.44] carrots and they don't know why well the
[426.00 - 429.44] reason why they can't eat carrots
[429.76 - 433.12] is because
[431.44 - 435.60] that affected them a lot more than
[433.12 - 439.76] somebody else but i love carrots so what
[435.60 - 442.08] i like to do anyways i cut that top off
[439.76 - 443.28] i mean i eat them with the tops
[442.08 - 444.56] but i know there's people that are
[443.28 - 445.84] sensitive
[444.56 - 447.60] i'm not i don't have a sensitive
[445.84 - 449.36] digestion
[447.60 - 451.60] i mean i could you know it's not going
[449.36 - 454.00] to affect me but it will
[451.60 - 455.60] it will affect somebody else for sure
[454.00 - 457.28] who's struggling with digestive problems
[455.60 - 459.84] so what i say with carrots that's what
[457.28 - 461.76] you want to do
[459.84 - 463.28] so what i'm doing is cutting this and i
[461.76 - 465.12] like that tip because that's a really
[463.28 - 466.40] important tip
[465.12 - 468.16] that's what that is
[466.40 - 470.24] you cut the top off you don't have to
[468.16 - 472.48] cut that far i probably cut a little too
[470.24 - 474.24] far right there on that top right you

[551.84 - 555.92] i didn't peel the carrots
[553.84 - 557.60] i didn't feel like i had to on this you
[555.92 - 559.28] know like then what i wanted to do i
[557.60 - 561.36] didn't peel the carrots but you know
[559.28 - 562.88] what i did is i washed them so i want to
[561.36 - 566.08] talk about like why it's important to
[562.88 - 567.84] wash some techniques about washing
[566.08 - 569.68] a little bit about that what happens is
[567.84 - 571.28] that
[569.68 - 572.48] produce
[571.28 - 577.12] could be
[572.48 - 580.00] in a box and those boxes on a pallet in
[577.12 - 582.64] the truck could be under other boxes it
[580.00 - 584.00] happens all the time they could be under
[582.64 - 585.20] chicken
[584.00 - 587.20] fresh
[585.20 - 589.92] chicken boxes
[587.20 - 591.92] and chicken juices can be dripping on
[589.92 - 593.36] produce this is why washing produce is
[591.92 - 595.12] so important
[593.36 - 597.92] it's different when you're picking it
[595.12 - 600.32] yourself maybe in the farm or something
[597.92 - 602.00] if you do you know like pick your own or
[600.32 - 603.92] you got your garden or anything like
[602.00 - 606.40] that that's different right but you got
[603.92 - 607.44] to be careful with
[606.40 - 609.52] with
[607.44 - 610.88] you know you can have some in la e coli
[609.52 - 612.40] the whole bit
[610.88 - 614.72] right
[612.40 - 615.68] and the thing is with chicken
[614.72 - 618.00] is like
[615.68 - 620.72] chicken can kill you
[618.00 - 620.72] it can kill you
[621.60 - 626.16] eggs can kill you
[623.44 - 628.80] right eggs can kill you mayonnaise do
[626.16 - 630.32] you ever think about that mayonnaise
[628.80 - 631.28] don't leave the mayonnaise out in the
[630.32 - 634.00] sun
[631.28 - 634.96] why because you'll die
[634.00 - 636.64] uh
[634.96 - 637.92] at the cookout make sure the mayonnaise
[636.64 - 639.84] is cold oh my god make sure the
[637.92 - 642.32] mayonnaise is cold if the mayonnaise
[639.84 - 644.08] doesn't stay cold everybody's gonna be
[642.32 - 646.00] on the toilet and barfing and holding
[644.08 - 647.44] the toilet for dear life and throwing up
[646.00 - 649.52] and diarrhea
[647.44 - 652.32] just don't let the mayonnaise get cold
[649.52 - 653.36] because why because egg
[652.32 - 655.12] egg
[653.36 - 657.20] right didn't i i taught you guys about
[655.12 - 659.60] the whole thing about eggs right eggs
[657.20 - 661.36] are the food that raised all the
[659.60 - 663.20] pathogens
[661.36 - 664.32] in in the classified medical research
[663.20 - 667.76] and science labs right it's all the
[664.32 - 667.76] whole thing i told you guys about that
[670.16 - 674.28] so the whole point is
[674.72 - 681.36] is that eggs feed bacteria really fast
[679.28 - 683.44] so when you bring your mayonnaise in the
[681.36 - 685.76] sun
[683.44 - 688.96] you bring your mayonnaise outside
[685.76 - 690.72] and a fly lands on your mayonnaise
[688.96 - 692.96] it's possible the fly can bring some
[690.72 - 695.20] bacteria from somebody's garbage can
[692.96 - 696.56] down the road right
[695.20 - 698.40] when you're at a cookout or you're out
[696.56 - 700.24] in the backyard and you've got that mayo
[698.40 - 703.36] that fly can bring some bacteria from
[700.24 - 705.04] somebody's garbage can down the street
[703.36 - 707.12] and that bacteria
[705.04 - 709.36] you know what if somebody threw out some
[707.12 - 710.88] bad meat at their house and they threw
[709.36 - 712.00] it in the can it was in the garbage bag
[710.88 - 713.92] and it was kind of sitting there open
[712.00 - 715.52] and the flies got into the garbage bag
[713.92 - 718.56] and they just started you know landing
[715.52 - 720.72] on that meat and then what happened was
[718.56 - 722.88] that meat had all this e coli and stuff
[720.72 - 724.96] and everything else or some raw chicken
[722.88 - 726.32] bags were thrown in there and the fly
[724.96 - 727.92] then landed in
[726.32 - 730.32] somebody's cookout and then landed in
[727.92 - 733.12] the mayo dish the bacteria that the fly
[730.32 - 734.40] brought can proliferate in hours
[733.12 - 736.16] in hours
[734.40 - 739.68] and that's why
[736.16 - 741.76] what happens is you you know
[739.68 - 744.48] it's crazy and the same thing with with
[741.76 - 747.12] chicken like if you eat chicken juices
[744.48 - 749.20] they can kill you undercooked chicken
[747.12 - 751.04] right can kill you right
[749.20 - 753.12] all that information
[751.04 - 754.96] citric acid i saw something about citric
[753.12 - 756.32] acid over there yeah citric acid not
[754.96 - 759.12] good not good
[756.32 - 760.32] when it's in processed food and
[759.12 - 761.76] everything else and all these other
[760.32 - 763.84] things are you guys i just put some
[761.76 - 765.84] carrots in the pan so i got that on on
[763.84 - 769.52] here too so i'm gonna keep on going i'm
[765.84 - 769.52] gonna cut some mushrooms how about that
[769.60 - 773.04] let's do that
[771.76 - 774.80] so i'm going to cut up some mushrooms
[773.04 - 776.96] right here if you guys are okay with
[774.80 - 776.96] that
[777.44 - 781.92] i think the bottom line is you got to
[779.84 - 783.36] wash your produce
[781.92 - 785.28] you got to wash them
[783.36 - 787.68] these are mushrooms right here you have
[785.28 - 789.12] to wash mushrooms with hot water
[787.68 - 791.36] remember that
[789.12 - 793.68] with hot water because you might you
[791.36 - 795.12] might eat a mushroom piece
[793.68 - 797.60] on its own
[795.12 - 799.36] that hasn't been in the pan so you got
[797.60 - 801.52] to make sure you wash because there's
[799.36 - 804.24] any bacteria on top of those mushrooms
[801.52 - 805.44] the manure that they grow mushrooms in
[804.24 - 808.88] manure
[805.44 - 808.88] has all this bacteria
[809.12 - 814.40] so you have to make sure that you
[812.08 - 816.56] wash them with hot water to really
[814.40 - 818.64] bind on to that bacteria and pull that
[816.56 - 820.64] bacteria off and like i said there's all
[818.64 - 822.72] this fresh produce it's all moved
[820.64 - 824.32] someone left a comment reminding me
[822.72 - 826.00] about that and i remember i've seen that
[824.32 - 827.44] through through the years
[826.00 - 828.64] and i'm glad that person left the
[827.44 - 830.32] comment because reminding me i was like
[828.64 - 832.40] yeah i know totally what happens is you

[1021.52 - 1027.84] love danielle great tip i make such a
[1023.92 - 1029.92] mess when i cut the cauliflower
[1027.84 - 1032.08] it does it makes a terrible mess doesn't
[1029.92 - 1035.52] it
[1032.08 - 1035.52] all right this is working
[1035.76 - 1040.72] this is going
[1036.84 - 1040.72] great there we go
[1041.68 - 1045.68] so i'm pulsing you don't want to make a
[1044.16 - 1047.60] smoothie you don't want to make a
[1045.68 - 1049.20] cauliflower smoothie keep that in mind
[1047.60 - 1051.92] okay you don't want to make a
[1049.20 - 1053.52] cauliflower smoothie right so you want
[1051.92 - 1056.00] to dump this in here
[1053.52 - 1056.00] there you go
[1060.00 - 1062.88] all right we're going to knock some more
[1061.28 - 1064.80] pieces in there we don't want to make a
[1062.88 - 1068.32] cauliflower smoothie that's the last
[1064.80 - 1070.08] thing we want keep that in mind
[1068.32 - 1072.24] yeah
[1070.08 - 1074.48] sarah says but if you are going to mince
[1072.24 - 1075.60] it what is the problem cutting the other
[1074.48 - 1079.04] way
[1075.60 - 1081.52] well what happens is is that
[1079.04 - 1082.96] most people are not going to make it
[1081.52 - 1084.32] their cauliflower rice they're just
[1082.96 - 1087.20] going to cut their cauliflower on the
[1084.32 - 1089.60] board and throw it nicely in a salad
[1087.20 - 1092.00] so that's a tip for every reason and
[1089.60 - 1093.60] when you cut it the other way and you
[1092.00 - 1096.24] want to put it in a salad it just starts
[1093.60 - 1097.68] to break apart and crumble and then it's
[1096.24 - 1098.96] not doesn't have that pretty look or
[1097.68 - 1100.80] maybe maybe you want to make a crude
[1098.96 - 1103.44] it's hay and you want them perfect for
[1100.80 - 1105.20] your crude hay for dipping right and
[1103.44 - 1106.64] then what you did was you ended up
[1105.20 - 1108.32] cutting it like this and it just started
[1106.64 - 1110.48] to fall apart when it was cutting these
[1108.32 - 1112.56] little pieces were popping off and then
[1110.48 - 1114.08] it just it ends up kind of falling apart
[1112.56 - 1116.16] like it was when i was first cutting all
[1114.08 - 1118.24] those big pieces so there's a lot of
[1116.16 - 1120.56] reasons i was just covering that tip for
[1118.24 - 1122.24] a second because it covers everything
[1120.56 - 1124.64] it's a great way to really keep it
[1122.24 - 1126.08] intact and you know what you get all
[1124.64 - 1127.52] these little pieces on the board if you
[1126.08 - 1128.64] cut it that way you got a board full of
[1127.52 - 1130.80] this stuff
[1128.64 - 1133.84] look you can get cauliflower rice in the
[1130.80 - 1133.84] store so i want to show you guys
[1134.08 - 1137.60] right that's cauliflower rice you can
[1135.68 - 1140.16] get in the store you guys on
[1137.60 - 1143.52] telegram you guys on tiktok
[1140.16 - 1143.52] right there's the cauliflower rice
[1144.08 - 1148.16] you can get that right in the store just
[1145.36 - 1149.12] like that frozen frozen section or fresh
[1148.16 - 1151.44] section
[1149.12 - 1152.80] it could be in the fresh or frozen
[1151.44 - 1155.92] you don't have to
[1152.80 - 1157.92] you don't have to make your own rice
[1155.92 - 1160.88] you don't have to do it this way
[1157.92 - 1163.20] i'm pulsing it right here see
[1160.88 - 1165.12] now remember i'm not making a smoothie
[1163.20 - 1167.52] you don't want this you don't want
[1165.12 - 1168.56] you don't want that
[1167.52 - 1170.00] because what's going to happen you're
[1168.56 - 1171.28] going to go too far and you're going to
[1170.00 - 1172.08] go too long and then you're going to
[1171.28 - 1173.92] have
[1172.08 - 1175.76] cauliflower mush
[1173.92 - 1178.32] kind of like cauliflower mush right is
[1175.76 - 1180.08] what you're going to end up with and you
[1178.32 - 1183.36] don't want to have that
[1180.08 - 1185.68] look at that isn't that great
[1183.36 - 1185.68] all right
[1185.92 - 1189.20] so i think what i'm going to do is cut
[1187.28 - 1190.88] an onion we're going to get an onion in
[1189.20 - 1193.84] here too
[1190.88 - 1193.84] so that's the plan
[1194.40 - 1197.44] i'm going to move this over
[1199.68 - 1203.68] you can you can save that too you can
[1201.68 - 1205.84] use that you can turn that into rice too
[1203.68 - 1207.68] that core cauliflower core you can
[1205.84 - 1208.72] totally turn into rice that's perfectly
[1207.68 - 1209.92] fine
[1208.72 - 1211.28] nothing wrong with that i'm gonna go
[1209.92 - 1213.92] with an onion i'm gonna go with a white
[1211.28 - 1216.00] onion right here
[1213.92 - 1218.00] remember how i taught you guys that
[1216.00 - 1219.04] that's the sweet part the top of the
[1218.00 - 1220.48] onion
[1219.04 - 1221.84] that's the roots you see the roots right
[1220.48 - 1223.44] there i don't know if you see those
[1221.84 - 1225.60] roots okay
[1223.44 - 1225.60] so
[1226.08 - 1230.48] a lot of cauliflower hanging around here
[1227.84 - 1232.40] i don't know if you see those roots
[1230.48 - 1234.40] that's the bitter part of the onion if
[1232.40 - 1236.16] you're making a salad someone's going to
[1234.40 - 1237.36] get the bitter part of the onion and
[1236.16 - 1238.24] when somebody gets a bitter part of the
[1237.36 - 1240.40] onion
[1238.24 - 1242.08] then your salad was
[1240.40 - 1242.88] you know could it could throw somebody
[1242.08 - 1244.00] off
[1242.88 - 1246.96] and they'll be like yeah it was all
[1244.00 - 1248.80] right that's the right salad
[1246.96 - 1251.36] so that's the bitter part of the onion
[1248.80 - 1253.68] right there so what i do is i usually
[1251.36 - 1256.24] save that for other things like a soup
[1253.68 - 1258.40] or something right so sometimes i just
[1256.24 - 1259.92] leave that part out so i'm gonna peel
[1258.40 - 1261.04] this back
[1259.92 - 1263.84] a little bit
[1261.04 - 1263.84] okay there you go
[1264.80 - 1269.60] all right
[1266.16 - 1269.60] i'm gonna peel that part back right
[1270.00 - 1273.68] and then
[1270.88 - 1273.68] i'm gonna cut this
[1274.48 - 1277.76] so that's the sweet part top of the
[1276.16 - 1281.20] onion where the greens were that's the
[1277.76 - 1281.20] sweet part right there okay
[1283.68 - 1287.12] i'm cutting tiny pieces i don't want big
[1285.68 - 1290.24] hunks but there's a couple of bigger
[1287.12 - 1292.16] hunks but they're not so big
[1290.24 - 1294.48] that's the bottom right there that's the
[1292.16 - 1298.16] part that's a little bit bitter and you
[1294.48 - 1300.64] can cut that bitter part off like that
[1298.16 - 1300.64] there you go
[1301.60 - 1306.08] believe it or not when someone gets that
[1304.00 - 1308.00] it's not a pleasing thing they don't
[1306.08 - 1310.40] know sure you're smothering it with
[1308.00 - 1312.24] ranch dressing you may not notice
[1310.40 - 1314.64] but there's a lot of people that pick
[1312.24 - 1316.00] subtle flavors up everywhere and or you
[1314.64 - 1317.60] know flavors that are a little bit more
[1316.00 - 1321.12] bitter or intense and they get thrown
[1317.60 - 1321.12] off by by everything
[1329.76 - 1333.92] just moving stuff over here giving
[1331.44 - 1337.28] myself a little bit of room
[1333.92 - 1337.28] we're going to chop up these onions
[1339.12 - 1342.88] if you guys just came on
[1341.04 - 1345.04] we're making stuffed butternut squash
[1342.88 - 1346.40] i'm making the stuffing we're also going
[1345.04 - 1347.68] to make some brussels sprouts some
[1346.40 - 1350.96] roasted brussels sprouts which are
[1347.68 - 1354.08] really good maple roasted right
[1350.96 - 1355.76] corny mma says your hands are incredible
[1354.08 - 1360.24] i'm honored
[1355.76 - 1361.92] hopefully i don't cut my hand
[1360.24 - 1363.44] so i'm chopping up the onions there's
[1361.92 - 1364.96] different ways of chopping these onions
[1363.44 - 1366.88] you know
[1364.96 - 1368.64] i'm trying not to blow your ears out too
[1366.88 - 1370.40] with any noise but there's different
[1368.64 - 1375.00] ways of chopping them you can do you

[1437.28 - 1441.04] cleanse the heel
[1438.72 - 1445.24] let's see what we have here
[1441.04 - 1445.24] covers are slipping on me there
[1445.68 - 1448.80] that's the stuff butternut squash right
[1447.28 - 1450.64] there i'm making which is really great
[1448.80 - 1452.00] and that's in cleanse the heel
[1450.64 - 1454.24] so that's there
[1452.00 - 1456.96] kendall says buy his books
[1454.24 - 1458.16] or get them free at the library recipes
[1456.96 - 1460.72] are in the books and there's lots of
[1458.16 - 1460.72] recipes
[1463.68 - 1468.64] dr von md good to see you
[1467.04 - 1470.32] so this is the medical medium cooking
[1468.64 - 1472.56] show we just moved it out of amazon
[1470.32 - 1474.24] amazon had a tech problem now we're here
[1472.56 - 1476.16] and what we're doing is we're going to
[1474.24 - 1477.76] go over some tips on some squash i'm
[1476.16 - 1479.52] going to let this cook down a little bit
[1477.76 - 1482.16] is what i'm going to do
[1479.52 - 1483.68] i'm going to get the lid
[1482.16 - 1485.92] like that
[1483.68 - 1488.88] keep that lid on let that cook up i'm
[1485.92 - 1490.64] going to clean off the board a touch
[1488.88 - 1493.12] because what happens is when you cut
[1490.64 - 1495.04] this squash you want to make sure you
[1493.12 - 1497.20] don't have anything on the board that's
[1495.04 - 1499.68] really important to know you don't want
[1497.20 - 1502.56] the squash slipping on you when you're
[1499.68 - 1505.04] trying to run that knife through it
[1502.56 - 1506.72] always be cautious
[1505.04 - 1508.64] when you're dealing with these squashes
[1506.72 - 1510.40] make sure the board is dry so i got this
[1508.64 - 1512.88] towel right here
[1510.40 - 1514.48] so make sure the board is dry
[1512.88 - 1515.60] right
[1514.48 - 1517.84] like that
[1515.60 - 1519.60] make sure the board is definitely got
[1517.84 - 1522.00] it's not wet because you don't want the
[1519.60 - 1524.16] squash to slip when you're cutting it
[1522.00 - 1525.76] keep that in mind right this is holiday
[1524.16 - 1528.56] recipe right here i mean the maple
[1525.76 - 1530.40] roasted brussels sprouts it's insane
[1528.56 - 1534.00] it's so good i can't wait to eat it i'm
[1530.40 - 1534.00] actually really really hungry right now
[1534.16 - 1537.28] because we're delayed okay so here's a
[1535.52 - 1540.16] couple of tips right here
[1537.28 - 1542.72] on the squash this is a kombucha squash
[1540.16 - 1546.16] right not kombucha tea
[1542.72 - 1548.80] about your squash not kombucha tea right
[1546.16 - 1549.60] so keep that in mind all right
[1548.80 - 1552.16] and
[1549.60 - 1554.40] what i'm doing is i'm taking my knife
[1552.16 - 1556.48] right this knife right here
[1554.40 - 1558.32] and i'm cutting this out
[1556.48 - 1560.64] carefully
[1558.32 - 1562.80] kind of putting my thumb on here
[1560.64 - 1564.40] so i'm holding the knife in a special
[1562.80 - 1566.32] way i'm not putting my knife under the
[1564.40 - 1568.64] blade right here i'm not putting my my
[1566.32 - 1571.28] hand under the blade
[1568.64 - 1573.36] i'm holding the knife but i'm putting my
[1571.28 - 1574.64] thumb thumb up closer to the knife like
[1573.36 - 1577.44] that right
[1574.64 - 1579.44] and this is how i do it okay and this is
[1577.44 - 1582.24] where you don't get cut
[1579.44 - 1584.72] and i'm taking out this really hard part
[1582.24 - 1586.24] right there
[1584.72 - 1587.84] taking that off
[1586.24 - 1590.24] because i've seen it over and over again
[1587.84 - 1591.92] over the years somebody's grandmom
[1590.24 - 1594.16] somebody's granddad somebody's uncle
[1591.92 - 1596.96] somebody's aunt sweeney's nephew
[1594.16 - 1599.44] somebody ends up biting on that at the
[1596.96 - 1601.44] table somewhere and then someone's
[1599.44 - 1603.92] getting to the dentist with an emergency
[1601.44 - 1605.84] dental problem
[1603.92 - 1607.04] so i like taking that really hard part
[1605.84 - 1608.80] off
[1607.04 - 1610.64] so that's important there and then i
[1608.80 - 1612.56] take this one off right here
[1610.64 - 1614.80] this is the other part the bottom of the
[1612.56 - 1616.64] squash not the stem but the bottom there
[1614.80 - 1618.40] we go
[1616.64 - 1620.88] take that off
[1618.40 - 1623.68] like that
[1620.88 - 1626.48] i do that because i've seen them the
[1623.68 - 1629.12] squash is baked boom they're baked and
[1626.48 - 1631.04] then someone gets that last piece
[1629.12 - 1633.04] last piece all right so i'm gonna i'm
[1631.04 - 1634.24] gonna put my knife through it okay so
[1633.04 - 1637.24] now i'm gonna put my knife through this
[1634.24 - 1637.24] squash
[1641.36 - 1645.44] you gotta be really careful when you do
[1643.04 - 1648.40] these really careful
[1645.44 - 1650.72] right kind of go around like that
[1648.40 - 1652.24] very cautious so now you got the inside
[1650.72 - 1653.36] i mean is that gorgeous you want to see
[1652.24 - 1655.28] that on tick tock you guys a little

[1658.08 - 1663.04] that's the inside the squash
[1660.80 - 1666.48] now here's a cool tip
[1663.04 - 1669.36] okay on telegram did you guys see
[1666.48 - 1672.40] right
[1669.36 - 1674.08] you know some people leave the seeds in

[1674.08 - 1677.76] baked it
[1675.12 - 1679.92] i take the seeds out because for for one
[1677.76 - 1682.40] i'm gonna stuff this one so i want the
[1679.92 - 1683.84] seeds out most everybody takes the seeds
[1682.40 - 1686.00] out
[1683.84 - 1688.00] which is gorgeous and by the way you can
[1686.00 - 1691.04] like
[1688.00 - 1694.40] you can throw these in a pan
[1691.04 - 1695.76] and actually have them pop like popcorn
[1694.40 - 1698.48] you throw them in a pan and they they
[1695.76 - 1700.80] start to toast up and then you can
[1698.48 - 1702.08] actually eat the insides which is really
[1700.80 - 1704.56] incredible the insides of these big
[1702.08 - 1706.32] squash seeds
[1704.56 - 1708.56] now here's the important thing right
[1706.32 - 1709.68] here which is a medical medium unique
[1708.56 - 1710.64] tip
[1709.68 - 1712.56] so
[1710.64 - 1715.52] i have to say that because someone would
[1712.56 - 1718.56] say oh he's not giving any unique tips
[1715.52 - 1719.36] false advertising
[1718.56 - 1722.00] no
[1719.36 - 1724.08] lots of unique tips for sure now what
[1722.00 - 1725.44] people don't realize is that fur that's
[1724.08 - 1728.40] left behind
[1725.44 - 1730.08] here that fur okay not that seed get
[1728.40 - 1733.12] that seed out
[1730.08 - 1734.88] but that fur is bitter
[1733.12 - 1736.96] and everybody leaves it in
[1734.88 - 1738.80] and their squash experience isn't as
[1736.96 - 1741.12] great as it should be it's not as great
[1738.80 - 1743.04] as it should be so it should be a better
[1741.12 - 1745.60] squash experience
[1743.04 - 1748.08] but that fur is left behind you want to
[1745.60 - 1750.40] scrape that out because it doesn't taste
[1748.08 - 1752.56] good it doesn't taste like that sweet
[1750.40 - 1754.96] squash is supposed to taste it's got an
[1752.56 - 1757.20] entirely different flavor
[1754.96 - 1759.20] so you want to scrape that out and i
[1757.20 - 1760.72] people don't know that this is bitter
[1759.20 - 1762.64] and doesn't have a good flavor they
[1760.72 - 1766.80] don't know that that's going to make
[1762.64 - 1768.64] their squash dish not that great
[1766.80 - 1770.40] they don't know this
[1768.64 - 1771.84] so what i'm doing is getting that out
[1770.40 - 1775.44] there it is
[1771.84 - 1779.36] that's the pulp with the fur on it
[1775.44 - 1782.16] on telegram tick-tock yes that's it
[1779.36 - 1783.60] that won't make that dish
[1782.16 - 1785.92] taste good
[1783.60 - 1788.24] it will be okay everybody will have
[1785.92 - 1790.48] squash their stuff squash they'd be like

[1971.28 - 1974.00] yeah
[1972.40 - 1975.68] i'm going to throw a few more mushrooms
[1974.00 - 1978.24] in here in a minute i think we're
[1975.68 - 1980.56] lacking a few mushrooms why not
[1978.24 - 1982.64] let me do that first before i
[1980.56 - 1984.24] move on
[1982.64 - 1986.00] all right
[1984.24 - 1990.28] so here we go i'm going to throw a few
[1986.00 - 1990.28] more mushrooms in here really quick
[1996.08 - 1999.40] there you go
[2007.44 - 2013.12] gonna get a few more mushrooms in here
[2010.64 - 2013.12] there we go
[2015.76 - 2019.28] all right
[2017.36 - 2021.20] this is cooking up nice
[2019.28 - 2023.28] on the little burner so let's take a
[2021.20 - 2025.76] look at this
[2023.28 - 2027.60] so we have is the butternut squash
[2025.76 - 2029.12] i cut off the ends there's a divot in
[2027.60 - 2030.16] here
[2029.12 - 2033.36] why
[2030.16 - 2036.16] because there was a pretty big hole
[2033.36 - 2037.60] poked into this i see it all the time in
[2036.16 - 2039.92] the market
[2037.60 - 2041.52] and what people don't realize
[2039.92 - 2043.84] is those holes
[2041.52 - 2045.76] right here's one here
[2043.84 - 2048.24] those gashes
[2045.76 - 2051.04] were equipment gashes
[2048.24 - 2052.48] that was equipment gashes
[2051.04 - 2055.20] equipment
[2052.48 - 2057.12] that you don't know what's on it you
[2055.20 - 2059.36] don't know what's on that farm equipment
[2057.12 - 2061.12] you don't know what's on that grocery
[2059.36 - 2061.92] store equipment you don't know what's on
[2061.12 - 2063.44] the
[2061.92 - 2064.96] the you know you don't know what's on
[2063.44 - 2066.56] that
[2064.96 - 2069.68] right
[2066.56 - 2072.96] so what you want to do is carve out any
[2069.68 - 2076.24] suspicious hole or
[2072.96 - 2079.76] mark that's big enough you carve it out
[2076.24 - 2079.76] now the squash that hit the floor
[2079.92 - 2083.92] which i'm just gonna grab for a second
[2082.32 - 2086.16] this is a squash that ran away the
[2083.92 - 2088.88] squash did not want to be cut open it's
[2086.16 - 2090.08] a shy squash okay
[2088.88 - 2091.60] now
[2090.08 - 2093.04] let's see if there's any marks on this
[2091.60 - 2094.96] one because i thought there was one
[2093.04 - 2096.24] there's a little one on this one here's
[2094.96 - 2097.76] one right here
[2096.24 - 2099.52] it's right there
[2097.76 - 2102.48] wait here we go right there see that
[2099.52 - 2105.28] mark
[2102.48 - 2105.28] i'm gonna cut that out
[2107.04 - 2109.84] i cut that off
[2110.16 - 2114.56] so i'm gonna put that over here
[2113.20 - 2115.84] that was on the floor so i'm not gonna
[2114.56 - 2118.64] put on the cutting board even though the
[2115.84 - 2121.12] floor is clean so over here
[2118.64 - 2122.64] so anyway
[2121.12 - 2124.08] the bottom line is what i'm trying to
[2122.64 - 2126.80] say is we don't know what's on that
[2124.08 - 2129.04] equipment we don't know what's on that
[2126.80 - 2130.40] whatever went into i've seen some gashes
[2129.04 - 2133.04] in some of the big
[2130.40 - 2134.80] big squashes and other things like that
[2133.04 - 2137.52] and those gashes
[2134.80 - 2141.12] there's grease on that equipment
[2137.52 - 2142.96] so a little bit of grease goes into like
[2141.12 - 2144.80] because i've seen all the farm equipment
[2142.96 - 2146.64] i've walked on a lot of farms i've
[2144.80 - 2149.92] visited a lot of farms visit some
[2146.64 - 2152.32] friends farms i've spent all around and
[2149.92 - 2155.76] all that farm equipment there's grease
[2152.32 - 2157.36] on every tractor grease on everything
[2155.76 - 2159.60] and what happens is people don't realize
[2157.36 - 2161.44] this so when you see when you see
[2159.60 - 2163.76] injuries to things you want to cut them
[2161.44 - 2166.72] out because you can have some grease and
[2163.76 - 2167.76] that's another original medical medium
[2166.72 - 2169.28] tip
[2167.76 - 2172.96] which is really important let's cut this
[2169.28 - 2176.56] open actually let's do that so
[2172.96 - 2177.44] let me make sure the board's not wet
[2176.56 - 2178.96] okay
[2177.44 - 2180.72] so you don't want the board wet when
[2178.96 - 2182.88] you're cutting your squashes you can
[2180.72 - 2184.96] even put a towel down so you can
[2182.88 - 2186.40] actually put a towel down while you're
[2184.96 - 2187.28] cutting it too
[2186.40 - 2190.72] but
[2187.28 - 2190.72] this is a pretty dry board
[2191.44 - 2195.76] chris says i work on a small scale
[2193.28 - 2197.12] organic farm it's hard haha yeah i know
[2195.76 - 2199.04] i can't
[2197.12 - 2201.04] i could imagine i know i understand
[2199.04 - 2204.96] right so here's the butter butternut
[2201.04 - 2204.96] squash right so i'm gonna cut this one
[2206.00 - 2211.52] now what i what i don't like about
[2208.24 - 2212.32] squashes is cutting them i don't like it
[2211.52 - 2214.96] right
[2212.32 - 2216.32] because you to be really careful you got
[2214.96 - 2219.12] to be really careful when you're cutting
[2216.32 - 2222.48] this can't can't be reckless you got to
[2219.12 - 2224.64] be cautious so here we go
[2222.48 - 2225.76] same rule applies with every single
[2224.64 - 2228.48] squash
[2225.76 - 2230.48] every single squash you scoop out
[2228.48 - 2234.00] not just the seeds
[2230.48 - 2235.44] not just the seeds of the squash
[2234.00 - 2238.32] right
[2235.44 - 2240.72] but you scoop out more than the seeds
[2238.32 - 2243.68] you scoop out the fur
[2240.72 - 2244.72] that fur you don't want to be baking and
[2243.68 - 2246.96] eating
[2244.72 - 2249.44] it's not going to hurt you it's just not
[2246.96 - 2251.04] going to make a pleasant flavor you're
[2249.44 - 2252.80] going to go into this part of the squash
[2251.04 - 2254.48] which is the sweetest part of squash and
[2252.80 - 2255.52] then there's this bitter side to it
[2254.48 - 2257.04] right there
[2255.52 - 2258.96] and you're gonna be like what i thought
[2257.04 - 2261.44] i had the swedish squash the sweetest
[2258.96 - 2264.80] one and it's not so sweet so i'm gonna
[2261.44 - 2264.80] scoop this one out too right
[2265.36 - 2269.60] so you wanna get
[2267.36 - 2272.16] that out
[2269.60 - 2274.40] now i stuffed this butternut squash that
[2272.16 - 2277.68] i that i've already cooked that we're
[2274.40 - 2279.36] gonna fill and prepare and all that
[2277.68 - 2281.68] okay here we go
[2279.36 - 2285.84] right so what i did was
[2281.68 - 2287.60] then you get this fur too out of here
[2285.84 - 2289.60] so if your squash has it up here you
[2287.60 - 2292.08] want it up there too you'll know because
[2289.60 - 2294.88] if you cook this and you just eat this
[2292.08 - 2298.00] part by itself you'll be like that just
[2294.88 - 2301.04] didn't taste great
[2298.00 - 2303.20] but when you get it out
[2301.04 - 2304.16] when you get it out
[2303.20 - 2306.32] wow
[2304.16 - 2309.28] tastes amazing now what i did with this
[2306.32 - 2310.72] squash because i'm i'm stuffing these
[2309.28 - 2313.04] squashes
[2310.72 - 2315.28] and baking them i cut a divot in here
[2313.04 - 2316.96] like this
[2315.28 - 2318.32] i wanted to make sure i had some
[2316.96 - 2320.24] stuffing room
[2318.32 - 2322.40] so i cut a divot right in the center a
[2320.24 - 2323.84] little bit just a little piece is what i
[2322.40 - 2325.44] did
[2323.84 - 2327.44] like that
[2325.44 - 2328.88] and so when i filled it
[2327.44 - 2330.00] i got room
[2328.88 - 2331.44] and that's what's happening with this
[2330.00 - 2334.56] one right here which is a cooked one
[2331.44 - 2336.08] right here which i'm excited about
[2334.56 - 2338.32] lake culture says
[2336.08 - 2340.32] now it makes sense why my pumpkin dishes
[2338.32 - 2342.88] taste different each time gotta remove
[2340.32 - 2344.96] the fur you got same thing same thing
[2342.88 - 2348.56] with the pumpkin identical thing with
[2344.96 - 2348.56] the pumpkin it's identical
[2349.04 - 2352.72] same problem so i'm gonna move this over
[2351.04 - 2354.08] a little bit
[2352.72 - 2355.44] i want to show you tip we're doing
[2354.08 - 2357.52] brussels sprouts i'm going to show you
[2355.44 - 2359.28] that as well a couple cool tips about
[2357.52 - 2361.20] brussels sprouts
[2359.28 - 2365.40] right so i'm going to get this cleaned
[2361.20 - 2365.40] up just give me a second you guys
[2369.76 - 2373.68] so the one thing about the holidays is
[2371.76 - 2375.60] that
[2373.68 - 2378.16] you gotta keep a light heart when you're
[2375.60 - 2380.64] making food for family and friends
[2378.16 - 2382.88] and you gotta have fun doing it and it
[2380.64 - 2385.44] doesn't have to be perfect
[2382.88 - 2387.76] never have it never has to be perfect
[2385.44 - 2389.84] but there's these cool things you can do
[2387.76 - 2392.48] to make it taste better right so which
[2389.84 - 2392.48] is really great
[2393.60 - 2396.32] all right
[2394.72 - 2399.92] so i cleared off that but let me just
[2396.32 - 2399.92] see if the stuffing is nice and done
[2401.04 - 2404.00] all right this is done now now i'm going
[2402.56 - 2407.52] to add
[2404.00 - 2407.52] some maple syrup to this
[2407.68 - 2411.84] right
[2408.72 - 2411.84] add a little bit of maple syrup
[2411.92 - 2416.40] because i want this to taste incredible
[2414.40 - 2419.64] and i'm going to add some lemon juice to
[2416.40 - 2419.64] this too
[2425.20 - 2428.40] add some lemon as well
[2430.08 - 2434.32] there we go
[2431.20 - 2434.32] a little bit more lemon
[2434.80 - 2439.48] make it really pop
[2436.48 - 2439.48] right
[2439.60 - 2446.00] mix it up because i got that maple syrup
[2441.68 - 2446.00] in there now i'm mixing it up with lemon
[2448.80 - 2452.96] it's just really delicious
[2451.52 - 2455.28] i'm going to put some dried thyme in
[2452.96 - 2455.28] here
[2456.96 - 2462.68] right pinch of dried thyme
[2459.28 - 2462.68] how about that
[2468.32 - 2471.36] and now i'm going to stuff
[2472.08 - 2474.88] these turkeys
[2475.36 - 2479.36] you know as i'm talking about earlier
[2477.60 - 2482.40] these are these aren't turkeys i was
[2479.36 - 2483.36] talking about this earlier you guys
[2482.40 - 2485.36] that
[2483.36 - 2486.16] i never liked that whole turkey gizzard
[2485.36 - 2487.68] thing
[2486.16 - 2489.52] turkey heart turkey gizzard because
[2487.68 - 2490.80] that's what's in there i forget to put a
[2489.52 - 2493.60] little garlic in there so let me get a
[2490.80 - 2495.84] garlic clove going
[2493.60 - 2495.84] right
[2497.84 - 2501.44] i never liked that whole stuff the
[2499.76 - 2504.00] turkey gizzard
[2501.44 - 2505.84] like with the gizzards and the heart
[2504.00 - 2507.60] because it's like you got a little heart
[2505.84 - 2509.12] little turkey heart in your hand right
[2507.60 - 2511.12] you know in the bag that comes in you
[2509.12 - 2512.40] pull the bag out of the turkey
[2511.12 - 2514.00] if you like turkey that's great i mean
[2512.40 - 2514.96] it's you can still do turkey in medical
[2514.00 - 2517.36] medium
[2514.96 - 2519.12] but when you pull that bag out
[2517.36 - 2520.88] trisha murray says me neither you pull
[2519.12 - 2523.04] that bag out and it's got all that stuff
[2520.88 - 2526.40] in there right it's got the liver that's
[2523.04 - 2527.60] the gizzard thing it's got the liver
[2526.40 - 2529.36] right
[2527.60 - 2530.80] and it's got a heart
[2529.36 - 2532.08] so you look at the heart you're like
[2530.80 - 2533.52] well what do i do with this heart will
[2532.08 - 2536.40] you chop it up because you put it in
[2533.52 - 2538.08] there for flavor
[2536.40 - 2540.16] i just never really like that i'm just
[2538.08 - 2543.76] mincing some garlic real quick you guys
[2540.16 - 2546.24] quick mince with with the knife
[2543.76 - 2546.24] there we go
[2547.52 - 2551.84] if you just got here re-watch i'm gonna
[2549.52 - 2554.40] post it after post it on rumble post it
[2551.84 - 2554.40] on youtube
[2555.20 - 2558.16] post it on telegram
[2559.68 - 2563.28] there we go we got some garlic in there
[2561.60 - 2566.56] that'll go good when it's
[2563.28 - 2566.56] when it's baking in the oven
[2569.36 - 2574.48] all right let's stuff
[2571.60 - 2574.48] these squashes
[2575.52 - 2579.84] let's do
[2576.84 - 2581.28] that you can put a little bit of salt in
[2579.84 - 2583.52] here
[2581.28 - 2585.28] you're welcome to do that
[2583.52 - 2586.80] right so you can do that if you want a
[2585.28 - 2590.00] little bit of salt in there you can put
[2586.80 - 2590.00] a little bit of salt in here
[2591.28 - 2595.36] i usually keep the salt out
[2593.92 - 2597.68] you know that's what i do i keep the
[2595.36 - 2599.44] salt out
[2597.68 - 2602.16] all right so here we go
[2599.44 - 2602.16] let's take a look
[2603.12 - 2606.16] so
[2604.72 - 2608.00] if you can see and you can get a
[2606.16 - 2608.88] close-up on this if you want to there
[2608.00 - 2611.12] you go
[2608.88 - 2613.12] look at that it's like a pie it's like a
[2611.12 - 2615.76] pie crust
[2613.12 - 2619.04] right telegram take a look tic tac it's
[2615.76 - 2621.12] a pie crust that's what it's like
[2619.04 - 2623.76] so i'm gonna fill it
[2621.12 - 2623.76] look at that
[2625.12 - 2628.56] how incredible is that right
[2629.52 - 2633.52] so i'm filling this
[2631.60 - 2635.76] pie crust basically
[2633.52 - 2638.32] okay so there's one right there let's
[2635.76 - 2638.32] get another
[2640.16 - 2642.32] and
[2642.88 - 2647.08] i got another one right here
[2648.96 - 2654.80] you don't have to make your own
[2650.64 - 2654.80] cauliflower rice you can
[2655.28 - 2660.76] buy the rice minced in the store
[2664.48 - 2667.84] there you go look at that
[2668.00 - 2672.08] that that's so good that's insanely good
[2672.40 - 2675.80] i love that
[2676.80 - 2681.36] i'm going to get these back
[2678.56 - 2681.36] on the pan
[2685.68 - 2693.44] now i'm going to bring these over here
[2689.04 - 2693.44] this is the butternut right here okay
[2695.12 - 2699.20] why are you cooking too long not sure if
[2697.76 - 2701.76] this tastes good
[2699.20 - 2703.12] if it's over or well done
[2701.76 - 2704.64] well the thing is you don't want the
[2703.12 - 2706.88] carrots
[2704.64 - 2707.68] hard
[2706.88 - 2709.68] right
[2707.68 - 2713.36] i don't have the heat on too high but
[2709.68 - 2713.36] you don't want the carrots hard
[2713.44 - 2717.72] you want to make sure those are cooked
[2718.32 - 2723.12] because the squash are already cooked
[2721.28 - 2725.84] they're already done so when i'm
[2723.12 - 2728.24] throwing this in at 400 heat in a minute
[2725.84 - 2730.72] to just basically really you know and
[2728.24 - 2732.64] you want the cauliflower to cook the
[2730.72 - 2735.04] problem is is the cauliflower takes a
[2732.64 - 2737.76] little longer cauliflower rice
[2735.04 - 2740.16] you don't want that hard either
[2737.76 - 2743.36] you want these just cooked right they're
[2740.16 - 2747.84] not super soft but they're not
[2743.36 - 2749.52] hard right that's that's why
[2747.84 - 2751.92] so what i'm doing is popping this on
[2749.52 - 2751.92] like that
[2752.48 - 2757.04] there we go
[2754.88 - 2760.60] all right so we got these all set these
[2757.04 - 2760.60] are going in the oven
[2761.04 - 2765.68] guys give me a second
[2762.64 - 2765.68] i'm gonna pop these in
[2767.04 - 2771.60] so that's what we have and that's what's
[2768.88 - 2771.60] going on right there
[2772.88 - 2777.12] maybe i'll drop this whole thing by
[2774.40 - 2778.32] accident on my way it'll come off
[2777.12 - 2781.12] that's what happens when you're live you
[2778.32 - 2782.24] don't know what could happen
[2781.12 - 2785.60] that is
[2782.24 - 2785.60] an amazing pan right there
[2786.16 - 2789.84] all right so that's in the oven
[2790.48 - 2795.28] i'm gonna clean up the board for a
[2791.84 - 2795.28] minute you guys give me a second here
[2796.96 - 2800.92] so the thing is is
[2803.12 - 2807.28] what you you want if you want your stuff
[2805.04 - 2809.36] to taste really good all these little
[2807.28 - 2812.64] tips matter too which is really great so
[2809.36 - 2814.16] i'm gonna show you some brussels sprouts
[2812.64 - 2817.16] i'm gonna do a little brussels sprout
[2814.16 - 2817.16] dish
[2820.32 - 2822.56] so
[2825.76 - 2831.36] i got some brussels sprouts right here
[2828.88 - 2833.20] okay here we are
[2831.36 - 2836.32] now these aren't raw
[2833.20 - 2839.28] i lightly steamed these
[2836.32 - 2841.52] because what happens is when you roast
[2839.28 - 2843.04] brussels sprouts
[2841.52 - 2845.60] they'll be tough
[2843.04 - 2847.12] like chewy and tough
[2845.60 - 2849.92] that that's hard on a lot of people for
[2847.12 - 2851.68] a lot of reasons not so easy to digest
[2849.92 - 2854.48] when they're tough and chewy and just
[2851.68 - 2856.88] not that fun you want them roasted but
[2854.48 - 2859.36] yet kind of creamy inside a little bit
[2856.88 - 2860.72] roasted and crispy on the top and on the
[2859.36 - 2862.72] edges
[2860.72 - 2864.56] but creamy inside like that's what you
[2862.72 - 2866.80] want so those are the steamed ones right
[2864.56 - 2866.80] there
[2867.20 - 2869.76] so what i'm going to do is cut some of
[2868.80 - 2872.80] these
[2869.76 - 2874.40] right here
[2872.80 - 2877.76] right and i'm going to put these right
[2874.40 - 2877.76] up here in front of here for you
[2880.64 - 2885.76] if you guys can see those a little bit
[2882.56 - 2888.96] so i'm just going to cut these up
[2885.76 - 2888.96] i'm going to cut them in half
[2899.52 - 2902.40] i'm going to move them out
[2904.16 - 2907.60] i'm going to cut them in half like this
[2910.80 - 2914.56] so these are going to be the maple
[2912.40 - 2917.44] roasted
[2914.56 - 2917.44] brussels sprouts
[2919.20 - 2921.76] right here
[2922.48 - 2926.56] i got a couple of raw ones i want to
[2924.32 - 2929.12] show you a tip on that
[2926.56 - 2931.20] which is going to be cool
[2929.12 - 2933.44] but i like to steam these a little
[2931.20 - 2936.48] because you can roast them
[2933.44 - 2938.00] all you want in there raw to start with
[2936.48 - 2940.24] and what happens is they're going to be
[2938.00 - 2942.00] tough and chewy they're just going to be
[2940.24 - 2943.36] tough and chewy that's what they're
[2942.00 - 2944.88] going to be
[2943.36 - 2945.60] so i'm giving these guys all a little
[2944.88 - 2947.36] bit
[2945.60 - 2949.92] of a cut right here you guys see this on
[2947.36 - 2949.92] telegram
[2950.08 - 2954.60] all right
[2951.20 - 2954.60] get some more
[2957.20 - 2960.56] now i did a big batch
[2964.24 - 2969.20] i steamed them for about 20 minutes
[2966.72 - 2971.28] you can even steam them for 30 minutes
[2969.20 - 2973.28] you can try you can check them out but i
[2971.28 - 2977.12] steamed them for
[2973.28 - 2979.68] 20 to maybe 25 minutes is what i did
[2977.12 - 2979.68] there we go
[2980.72 - 2985.36] did you cut the ends off okay good
[2982.72 - 2988.56] question i did it
[2985.36 - 2990.24] because if you steam them
[2988.56 - 2991.84] if you steam them they still come they
[2990.24 - 2993.92] come out really good those ends see
[2991.84 - 2995.84] that's the end right there so you're
[2993.92 - 2997.36] talking about that end and i saved this
[2995.84 - 2999.92] one on purpose to show you this right
[2997.36 - 3001.52] here right so what's interesting here is
[2999.92 - 3003.20] you got this end right here it's
[3001.52 - 3005.28] sticking out right
[3003.20 - 3007.12] so you got this end
[3005.28 - 3010.00] and
[3007.12 - 3011.28] what's happening is you can you can eat
[3010.00 - 3013.20] that end
[3011.28 - 3014.64] when it's cooked
[3013.20 - 3016.56] but that's why steaming is really good
[3014.64 - 3018.96] you steam for 25 minutes all this at
[3016.56 - 3020.72] least starts to soften up if you steam
[3018.96 - 3022.24] them longer this is all tender here i
[3020.72 - 3025.12] know a lot of people do this a lot of
[3022.24 - 3027.60] people will cut this end off like that
[3025.12 - 3030.00] so they'll cut the end completely off i
[3027.60 - 3032.32] keep them on even when there's that
[3030.00 - 3034.00] piece right there i still keep them on
[3032.32 - 3037.04] but you're welcome to cut them off
[3034.00 - 3037.04] definitely right
[3037.84 - 3042.24] you're definitely welcome to do that
[3044.48 - 3047.48] and
[3054.48 - 3056.96] there we go
[3060.64 - 3063.28] do some more
[3064.00 - 3068.24] i'm gonna make a nice big batch
[3066.64 - 3071.20] i got the squashes in the oven i could
[3068.24 - 3071.20] smell them already
[3072.88 - 3077.52] if you guys don't like maple syrup
[3075.04 - 3079.12] you can use honey if you want
[3077.52 - 3081.28] if you're if you're somebody that just
[3079.12 - 3083.52] won't do maple syrup for some reason you
[3081.28 - 3085.76] can use honey and that's okay
[3083.52 - 3085.76] right
[3088.00 - 3092.56] let's cut a few more
[3090.08 - 3092.56] and then we're
[3094.84 - 3099.20] good we'll get the rest of these done
[3099.68 - 3103.64] so i'm cutting these in half
[3112.96 - 3116.88] did i cut the ends off didn't cut the
[3115.12 - 3119.12] ends off
[3116.88 - 3122.12] kept the ends i always keep my ends on
[3119.12 - 3122.12] these
[3124.16 - 3128.32] when it comes down to brussels that's
[3126.16 - 3129.84] how i do it all right
[3128.32 - 3131.36] let's get these back in the bowl and
[3129.84 - 3135.88] then

[3469.76 - 3473.80] parchment paper on here
[3477.44 - 3480.16] show you guys
[3484.16 - 3489.32] all right
[3485.20 - 3489.32] so i'm getting these on the pan
[3493.44 - 3496.96] what do you guys think on telegram did
[3495.60 - 3498.24] you ever have these did you ever make
[3496.96 - 3502.44] the recipe
[3498.24 - 3502.44] right out of liver rescue
[3502.64 - 3507.56] you know what happens is when people
[3504.08 - 3507.56] make these recipes
[3516.56 - 3518.80] so
[3521.84 - 3527.04] save some sauce at the bottom of the
[3523.92 - 3528.96] bowl so that's what i recommend okay
[3527.04 - 3531.68] so save some of that sauce at the bottom
[3528.96 - 3533.92] of the bowl i'm gonna put all these on
[3531.68 - 3533.92] here
[3535.20 - 3540.76] there we go and i'm gonna spread them
[3536.72 - 3540.76] out on the pan look at that
[3544.88 - 3550.08] strange how people get mad when you heal
[3547.20 - 3552.32] sarah dylan they do get mad
[3550.08 - 3554.08] and know what's really strange
[3552.32 - 3555.84] is when
[3554.08 - 3556.80] tens of thousands and thousands of
[3555.84 - 3559.60] people
[3556.80 - 3562.48] it goes into millions around the world
[3559.60 - 3564.80] and they're healing from the mm info
[3562.48 - 3566.40] that's not allowed
[3564.80 - 3567.52] because then they'll call you a cult or
[3566.40 - 3569.36] something
[3567.52 - 3570.96] say oh you're a cult well that's funny
[3569.36 - 3573.36] then it must be the biggest cult on the
[3570.96 - 3575.60] planet because 500 million people are
[3573.36 - 3577.60] drinking celery juice
[3575.60 - 3579.04] millions and millions of medical medium
[3577.60 - 3581.12] books are out there in almost every
[3579.04 - 3583.36] country in the world
[3581.12 - 3585.84] i guess we're just not allowed to heal
[3583.36 - 3588.16] or something
[3585.84 - 3589.68] it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
[3588.16 - 3592.00] and it's all free
[3589.68 - 3595.12] does that make any sense it's all free
[3592.00 - 3595.12] go to library and get the book
[3596.48 - 3601.28] meanwhile you got the medical colts
[3600.08 - 3603.84] are scary
[3601.28 - 3605.84] you got the alkaline ionizer water
[3603.84 - 3606.88] machine colts you guys i got this set up
[3605.84 - 3609.36] here

[3667.36 - 3672.64] lamb lamb tail says yep bro
[3670.48 - 3674.48] yum bro give us a shout out the spirit
[3672.64 - 3677.04] of compassion
[3674.48 - 3678.48] that's great trisha marie says delish
[3677.04 - 3681.68] i'm gonna let these cedar for a second i
[3678.48 - 3681.68] want to show you a couple tips
[3682.24 - 3684.56] let's get another brussels sprout right
[3683.68 - 3687.52] here
[3684.56 - 3689.44] and i want to show you guys this right
[3687.52 - 3690.96] what i do is i peel back the leaf i mean
[3689.44 - 3692.96] everybody probably does that
[3690.96 - 3696.16] i'm sure a lot of people do that right
[3692.96 - 3698.48] if the leaf is yellow or yellowing you
[3696.16 - 3700.48] want to take that leaf off
[3698.48 - 3701.52] that leaf
[3700.48 - 3702.88] tastes
[3701.52 - 3704.88] terrible
[3702.88 - 3705.92] terrible so when you get the yellow
[3704.88 - 3708.16] leaves
[3705.92 - 3709.92] on your brussels sprouts
[3708.16 - 3711.76] awful flavor
[3709.92 - 3714.64] it'll ruin it'll ruin the whole brussels
[3711.76 - 3716.48] sprout because the yellow leaf
[3714.64 - 3719.12] decayed
[3716.48 - 3721.28] and so it's just got this awful oxidized
[3719.12 - 3723.04] flavor it could ruin it just ruins your
[3721.28 - 3724.96] whole dish so what i did was i picked
[3723.04 - 3726.48] off all the yellow leaves
[3724.96 - 3728.80] right i'll show you guys on a close-up
[3726.48 - 3731.44] too i picked up all i picked them all
[3728.80 - 3734.32] off so this is a raw brussels sprout
[3731.44 - 3737.44] these are steamed in here
[3734.32 - 3739.44] amber says starting the cleanse with mom
[3737.44 - 3741.92] whoa incredible
[3739.44 - 3744.16] so what i do is i take this off
[3741.92 - 3746.00] when they're yellow or decayed on any
[3744.16 - 3747.28] level and right there there's that dk on
[3746.00 - 3749.20] there it's on there i know if you guys
[3747.28 - 3750.80] can see it it's basically just plant
[3749.20 - 3752.64] decay it's it's
[3750.80 - 3754.56] it's leaves that have gone bad on here
[3752.64 - 3756.40] so i kind of pull back that leaf that
[3754.56 - 3759.04] one's really stuck on
[3756.40 - 3762.32] but i pull that leaf off like that
[3759.04 - 3764.16] there you go aj i saw you
[3762.32 - 3765.84] there you go and i took that leaf off
[3764.16 - 3768.56] these leaves taste terrible when they
[3765.84 - 3771.28] start to decay like that
[3768.56 - 3772.56] and i know people peel back their
[3771.28 - 3774.88] brussels sprouts
[3772.56 - 3775.84] i do know that some people do that right
[3774.88 - 3779.36] but
[3775.84 - 3781.20] the leaf when it's decaying or yellow it
[3779.36 - 3784.16] stays in the mix it's going to ruin the
[3781.20 - 3784.16] flavor of the whole dish
[3784.24 - 3789.36] right
[3785.52 - 3789.36] so in rumble kim marie
[3790.16 - 3795.04] and cindy you know and ben ben watson
[3792.16 - 3795.04] i'm glad you guys are there
[3795.28 - 3800.24] glad you guys are on there
[3797.84 - 3801.92] so debbie said did he say pull off the
[3800.24 - 3804.40] yellow only
[3801.92 - 3805.28] you can pull off the yellow only yeah
[3804.40 - 3807.76] only
[3805.28 - 3810.72] but if you see a leaf that's not yellow
[3807.76 - 3812.24] but it's like it's decayed okay here's
[3810.72 - 3814.24] one right here
[3812.24 - 3816.16] you see this one's not okay here it is
[3814.24 - 3818.08] right there that'll show it perfectly
[3816.16 - 3820.64] good thing i had one left
[3818.08 - 3822.72] see right there you guys a close-up i
[3820.64 - 3825.28] know you can't see it on telegram
[3822.72 - 3827.12] no maybe you guys can on tick-tock
[3825.28 - 3829.36] put that close-up up there
[3827.12 - 3831.84] that right there so you can do this you
[3829.36 - 3833.20] can even take shortcuts and not peel
[3831.84 - 3835.04] back the leaf if you don't want to
[3833.20 - 3837.12] that's the leaf i peeled back you can
[3835.04 - 3838.88] take shortcuts if you don't want to peel
[3837.12 - 3840.64] back the leaf right like you can peel
[3838.88 - 3843.76] back that leaf but if you don't want to
[3840.64 - 3844.96] you can just do this
[3843.76 - 3846.80] if you want
[3844.96 - 3849.12] and you get rid of that because that
[3846.80 - 3850.64] piece right there will ruin
[3849.12 - 3852.88] that taste
[3850.64 - 3854.64] of your meal it just does
[3852.88 - 3856.80] those leaves when they're they when they
[3854.64 - 3858.96] get nasty like that they're nasty to
[3856.80 - 3860.72] your meal so that's really important to
[3858.96 - 3862.16] know i'm just trying to show everybody
[3860.72 - 3866.20] including the close-up right and there
[3862.16 - 3866.20] you go on tiktok and pilgrim
[3866.32 - 3870.96] dno says hey w i was introduced to you
[3868.72 - 3873.92] last week i bought cleanse the heel and
[3870.96 - 3875.68] your medical media two great books i
[3873.92 - 3877.68] committed to lemon water daily and
[3875.68 - 3879.94] celery juice and supplements i plan on
[3877.68 - 3881.92] doing a cleanse next week yeah
[3879.94 - 3883.84] [Laughter]
[3881.92 - 3887.36] proud of you
[3883.84 - 3888.88] proud proud proud of you definitely
[3887.36 - 3891.52] tristan says you're amazing teacher i'm
[3888.88 - 3893.20] sure you are too i'm sure you're amazing
[3891.52 - 3895.36] teacher as well
[3893.20 - 3897.28] because you know we're all teachers
[3895.36 - 3899.20] we're all teachers here right that's
[3897.28 - 3901.52] what it is that's what we are
[3899.20 - 3903.20] you know we're all trying to teach look
[3901.52 - 3905.28] the whole point though is with that
[3903.20 - 3907.28] brussels sprout look out for that that's
[3905.28 - 3908.88] something to know like i said before if
[3907.28 - 3910.24] you're going to steam brussels sprouts
[3908.88 - 3912.32] and that's the only way you're going to
[3910.24 - 3914.24] make them another tip that's important
[3912.32 - 3916.00] when you steam brussels sprouts and it's
[3914.24 - 3917.60] the only way you're going to make them
[3916.00 - 3919.76] or you're going to cook them in some way
[3917.60 - 3922.40] you want to cook them till they're soft
[3919.76 - 3925.12] inside until the fork goes through
[3922.40 - 3927.36] so let me just show you right here right
[3925.12 - 3929.36] like you want to make sure like that
[3927.36 - 3931.68] these are still these are only steamed
[3929.36 - 3933.44] for 20 minutes 25 minutes right but
[3931.68 - 3935.20] there might be a soft one in here okay
[3933.44 - 3937.52] here's a soft one
[3935.20 - 3939.76] you want to steam them until that fork
[3937.52 - 3941.84] goes through
[3939.76 - 3944.80] because if you have any digestive issues
[3941.84 - 3948.16] whatsoever that's to that's how you
[3944.80 - 3951.04] avoid digestive distress you don't want
[3948.16 - 3953.68] half cooked brussels sprouts you don't
[3951.04 - 3955.04] want chewy brussels sprouts if you're
[3953.68 - 3956.16] going to steam them or cook them and
[3955.04 - 3957.84] just eat them so you're not even going
[3956.16 - 3959.04] to do this roasted brussels sprout meal
[3957.84 - 3960.56] out of the book
[3959.04 - 3963.52] you want to make sure you steam them
[3960.56 - 3965.60] until the fork goes in where it's soft
[3963.52 - 3967.36] where they're creamy inside where you
[3965.60 - 3969.60] can eat them and they're creamy inside
[3967.36 - 3971.44] that's how you want to do it that's
[3969.60 - 3974.00] important
[3971.44 - 3976.16] for any kind of problems at all
[3974.00 - 3978.24] kenneth says maybe that's why i was not
[3976.16 - 3979.92] having it when eating steamed brussels
[3978.24 - 3983.20] sprouts for three to four days during my
[3979.92 - 3984.12] original 369 that's exactly why it can
[3983.20 - 3986.00] it
[3984.12 - 3987.92] exactly why
[3986.00 - 3991.28] you when they're chewy or tough in the
[3987.92 - 3993.84] center you're gonna have a tummy full of
[3991.28 - 3995.84] roughage that doesn't want to break down
[3993.84 - 3997.44] or digest easy
[3995.84 - 3998.96] and and what i did here is i steamed
[3997.44 - 4000.64] them for 25 minutes and that's not
[3998.96 - 4003.04] enough if you just want to have it that
[4000.64 - 4005.76] way alone but when i put it in the oven
[4003.04 - 4007.84] and then i roast them for a while too
[4005.76 - 4009.12] that's where it takes that next level
[4007.84 - 4011.28] where they're going to start getting it
[4009.12 - 4012.64] you know softer but you can cook them
[4011.28 - 4014.32] not roast them you can cook them where
[4012.64 - 4015.68] they're where you're steaming them real
[4014.32 - 4017.04] soft if you're going to do like a mono
[4015.68 - 4017.84] cleanser brussels sprouts or something
[4017.04 - 4019.52] like that if you're going to do
[4017.84 - 4020.72] something like on the 369 and you're
[4019.52 - 4022.56] cleansing you want to cook them when
[4020.72 - 4023.92] they're really really soft that's what
[4022.56 - 4026.64] you want to do
[4023.92 - 4028.88] yep that's important
[4026.64 - 4028.88] so
[4029.12 - 4033.60] all right so i have these getting ready
[4030.72 - 4035.76] right here i'm going to move these over

[4145.20 - 4148.96] so
[4147.52 - 4152.48] you guys see that
[4148.96 - 4152.48] on telegram you guys see that
[4153.68 - 4158.24] right
[4154.56 - 4158.24] we're gonna cook this down for a while
[4158.88 - 4164.16] that's what we need to do
[4160.72 - 4164.16] so i'm going to dice up an apple
[4164.80 - 4169.44] these apples are incredible
[4166.96 - 4169.44] right here
[4169.52 - 4174.80] i want to give you a tip on apples
[4172.00 - 4176.08] you want to have or enjoy the best apple
[4174.80 - 4177.52] do you know do you want to know how to
[4176.08 - 4179.52] pick apples
[4177.52 - 4181.20] i'm not talking about off the tree
[4179.52 - 4182.88] i'm talking about picking them at the
[4181.20 - 4184.00] store right
[4182.88 - 4186.56] do you want to know how to pick these
[4184.00 - 4189.44] apples at the store
[4186.56 - 4190.72] you want to look for apple skins
[4189.44 - 4192.80] that have
[4190.72 - 4193.60] that kind of design those marks you see
[4192.80 - 4195.60] this
[4193.60 - 4197.36] it's not a perfect
[4195.60 - 4199.52] apple
[4197.36 - 4201.20] right you don't want bruises there's no
[4199.52 - 4202.56] bruises on this apple right there's no
[4201.20 - 4205.36] bruises
[4202.56 - 4208.64] but the best flavored apples inside have
[4205.36 - 4210.88] the skin that looks kind of geographic
[4208.64 - 4212.32] see that right there
[4210.88 - 4214.88] see how it looks like it's got like
[4212.32 - 4216.64] constellations or stars
[4214.88 - 4218.16] and that that means that whether it's
[4216.64 - 4219.36] honey crisp all the same whether it's
[4218.16 - 4220.80] fuji all the same this is what you're
[4219.36 - 4222.00] looking for well there's pink lady
[4220.80 - 4224.16] that's what you're looking for red
[4222.00 - 4226.64] delicious that's what you're looking for
[4224.16 - 4227.52] you're looking for the skins to have
[4226.64 - 4228.72] like
[4227.52 - 4230.72] this
[4228.72 - 4232.64] rough patches
[4230.72 - 4234.24] where it's like what is that like what's
[4232.64 - 4237.28] that rough patch
[4234.24 - 4239.76] right that means you have the crispiest
[4237.28 - 4241.68] sweetest apples
[4239.76 - 4244.96] out of that bunch
[4241.68 - 4247.44] okay and the only people that probably
[4244.96 - 4250.08] have an idea about that one are apple
[4247.44 - 4251.60] growers themselves that are so
[4250.08 - 4254.08] they're so used to tasting their own
[4251.60 - 4256.16] apples and picking them and and trying
[4254.08 - 4259.04] them out and harvesting them that they
[4256.16 - 4260.64] know this right they know this and i've
[4259.04 - 4263.36] been blessed to know it because i've
[4260.64 - 4266.80] picked a lot of apples and so it's
[4263.36 - 4269.84] really a special little tip
[4266.80 - 4271.04] so i want to do is cut these pieces thin
[4269.84 - 4273.20] i want them
[4271.04 - 4275.28] thin and small i don't want these pieces
[4273.20 - 4276.88] too big because this apple's gonna cook
[4275.28 - 4278.48] down
[4276.88 - 4280.64] is what it's gonna do so i'm cutting
[4278.48 - 4282.56] these pretty thin i want this apple to
[4280.64 - 4284.16] cook down in that sauce
[4282.56 - 4288.64] all right so i don't want big hunky
[4284.16 - 4288.64] pieces in this right
[4289.12 - 4294.64] lacey said breath bauer says i had no
[4292.72 - 4296.08] idea thank you
[4294.64 - 4297.76] that's what the medical medium cooking
[4296.08 - 4300.72] show is here for is to make sure that we
[4297.76 - 4302.32] can do these things right serena x says
[4300.72 - 4304.16] whoa
[4302.32 - 4305.76] you will get the best apples and then
[4304.16 - 4308.32] everybody else will have these other
[4305.76 - 4310.64] apples that aren't the best
[4308.32 - 4314.56] lori malone says wow great apple tip
[4310.64 - 4316.16] yeah i'm going to show you right here
[4314.56 - 4317.84] you see i have a different apple here
[4316.16 - 4320.24] right so it's not different apple the
[4317.84 - 4323.04] same pineapples now i picked
[4320.24 - 4326.00] purposely all these kinds of apples
[4323.04 - 4328.48] where they have that geographic zone so
[4326.00 - 4330.96] these are all the best apples possible
[4328.48 - 4332.64] this has less see see how's this less
[4330.96 - 4334.64] this look that has less believe it or
[4332.64 - 4335.76] not it has it but less it's not like
[4334.64 - 4337.44] that
[4335.76 - 4338.32] you see the different difference there
[4337.44 - 4339.76] we go
[4338.32 - 4341.20] you see that
[4339.76 - 4343.84] that's how you pick them in the store
[4341.20 - 4345.52] guess which one you pick you pick that
[4343.84 - 4347.68] one at the store
[4345.52 - 4349.92] i want to show you on tick-tock you pick
[4347.68 - 4351.68] the one here
[4349.92 - 4355.52] right there you see all that you don't
[4351.68 - 4356.06] pick that one you pick this one
[4355.52 - 4357.28] yeah
[4356.06 - 4359.52] [Music]
[4357.28 - 4360.56] it's a tip that you will be so happy
[4359.52 - 4362.56] about
[4360.56 - 4365.36] along the way i promise you you will be
[4362.56 - 4367.76] so happy about you will be like okay
[4365.36 - 4369.52] wait a minute and if you have a basket
[4367.76 - 4371.28] of apples you you bought a bunch of
[4369.52 - 4372.24] different apples you'll know when you
[4371.28 - 4374.08] start
[4372.24 - 4376.24] trying it out like that
[4374.08 - 4378.96] be open-hearted has a question looks
[4376.24 - 4380.08] like a question for soc really
[4378.96 - 4382.56] because
[4380.08 - 4385.12] my brain can't hold
[4382.56 - 4388.48] the trillions of pounds of information
[4385.12 - 4390.96] from soc every second so why is that the
[4388.48 - 4393.76] geographic area right
[4390.96 - 4395.52] okay that means that a temperature
[4393.76 - 4398.40] change happened
[4395.52 - 4400.72] and that temperature temperature change
[4398.40 - 4402.32] brought the sweetness out so the
[4400.72 - 4404.16] temperature fluctuation spirit of
[4402.32 - 4405.28] compassion is telling me right now so
[4404.16 - 4406.72] you're
[4405.28 - 4408.96] that's how that's because i didn't know
[4406.72 - 4411.92] i forgot or didn't know but it's attempt
[4408.96 - 4413.92] that means we had we had in that crop
[4411.92 - 4415.92] right when it was coming to almost
[4413.92 - 4416.96] getting ripe the whole batch of apples
[4415.92 - 4418.88] in that crop
[4416.96 - 4421.68] we had some temperature changes where
[4418.88 - 4423.60] the temperature went really high or low
[4421.68 - 4425.52] and most likely the temperature dropped
[4423.60 - 4427.76] and went low so that means it might have
[4425.52 - 4429.68] been a frost coming on or close to a
[4427.76 - 4431.20] frost the temperature spirit compassion
[4429.68 - 4433.36] is telling me right now the temperature
[4431.20 - 4435.44] dropped to maybe 40 degrees and it
[4433.36 - 4437.04] wasn't 40 degrees for a while and it's
[4435.44 - 4439.28] the end of august it's the end of
[4437.04 - 4441.60] september it's in the middle of october
[4439.28 - 4443.12] and then often boom you get a 38 degree
[4441.60 - 4445.92] night
[4443.12 - 4447.12] and then the the sweetness comes out and
[4445.92 - 4449.36] the skin
[4447.12 - 4450.96] turns that rough color because of that
[4449.36 - 4452.40] temperature shift
[4450.96 - 4454.16] because the chemistry of the apple
[4452.40 - 4456.88] changes spirit of compassion says it
[4454.16 - 4459.20] changes and shifts and then the sugar
[4456.88 - 4461.20] comes out to more it comes out of the
[4459.20 - 4463.20] core like literally sugar comes right
[4461.20 - 4464.96] out of the core and then the core will
[4463.20 - 4467.20] be won't be sweet
[4464.96 - 4468.72] the core won't be sweet and what happens
[4467.20 - 4470.72] is with these other apples when that
[4468.72 - 4472.00] doesn't happen in certain crops spirit
[4470.72 - 4474.24] of compassion is dumb this is new
[4472.00 - 4475.60] information for me i had no idea about
[4474.24 - 4476.56] this spirit kabash is telling me right
[4475.60 - 4477.92] now that
[4476.56 - 4478.96] the core
[4477.92 - 4481.36] right
[4478.96 - 4483.04] is more sweeter on the not so good
[4481.36 - 4485.28] apples and then all the flesh and the
[4483.04 - 4486.88] apples when this doesn't happen is not
[4485.28 - 4488.56] as sweet so that's a piece of
[4486.88 - 4490.64] information i just learned now because
[4488.56 - 4492.80] yes you asked
[4490.64 - 4495.36] you know
[4492.80 - 4497.68] i like learning
[4495.36 - 4499.36] i'm learning a heck of a lot right now
[4497.68 - 4501.12] with that new book that i'm trying to
[4499.36 - 4502.64] finish and hand to the publisher
[4501.12 - 4504.64] hopefully soon
[4502.64 - 4507.04] i'm learning a lot information about the
[4504.64 - 4508.80] human body i had no idea about even all
[4507.04 - 4511.76] these years
[4508.80 - 4514.80] the book is a massive book
[4511.76 - 4514.80] a massive book
[4515.76 - 4519.28] so i'm going to get this apple in here
[4519.60 - 4524.92] and actually get this apple cooking down
[4521.36 - 4524.92] is what we're going to do
[4526.08 - 4529.12] so we're going to chop this up
[4533.84 - 4538.24] and that's why i wear glasses because if
[4536.24 - 4540.40] i answer questions specifically that
[4538.24 - 4542.40] spirit of compassion is giving me new
[4540.40 - 4544.88] information for in the moment like an
[4542.40 - 4546.48] actual read
[4544.88 - 4548.08] then
[4546.48 - 4550.00] now i'm getting whited out it's called
[4548.08 - 4550.96] snow blindness and i talk about it in
[4550.00 - 4553.92] here
[4550.96 - 4556.08] of how i lose the eyesight from that and
[4553.92 - 4558.16] then i'm struggling to actually even see
[4556.08 - 4560.16] anything so that's what starts happening
[4558.16 - 4562.16] and that's why these are on so that you
[4560.16 - 4563.84] don't see me like this
[4562.16 - 4565.44] okay and the glasses kind of kind of
[4563.84 - 4568.24] hide that when i need to do that like
[4565.44 - 4568.24] that sometimes
[4576.48 - 4579.20] all right let me get the rest these
[4577.60 - 4581.84] apples in while those brussels sprouts
[4579.20 - 4581.84] are cooking up
[4583.52 - 4588.96] this is an incredible
[4586.12 - 4590.24] incredible sauce
[4588.96 - 4592.80] it really is
[4590.24 - 4595.84] incredible sauce
[4592.80 - 4595.84] chop the rest of these up
[4600.64 - 4604.32] i'm mincing them practically right
[4602.56 - 4606.00] because you don't want these big hunky
[4604.32 - 4608.80] apple pieces in that sauce because you
[4606.00 - 4610.40] want them to break down that's the key
[4608.80 - 4612.16] that's that's a really important key
[4610.40 - 4614.56] right there so when you do it this way
[4612.16 - 4616.80] like that you got it nice and minced up
[4614.56 - 4616.80] right

[4694.56 - 4699.52] go let's do some orange tips
[4696.96 - 4700.56] those are my favorite orange tips
[4699.52 - 4703.60] right
[4700.56 - 4705.36] i like orange tips i like lemon tips
[4703.60 - 4708.40] right i like
[4705.36 - 4710.24] um tips on grapefruits i just like tips
[4708.40 - 4711.84] on all fruits so that's why i like
[4710.24 - 4713.76] fruits or fruit tips are my favorite i
[4711.84 - 4716.48] guess right
[4713.76 - 4718.32] so juice from one orange so one of the
[4716.48 - 4720.40] things about oranges
[4718.32 - 4722.16] you don't want them soft you don't want
[4720.40 - 4723.36] them soft if you guys pick oranges in
[4722.16 - 4725.52] the grocery store and you're picking
[4723.36 - 4727.28] them soft and they're too soft go with
[4725.52 - 4729.84] the hardest oranges go with the harder
[4727.28 - 4731.92] ones if you see a good batch of oranges
[4729.84 - 4734.08] go with the harder oranges if you go
[4731.92 - 4736.32] with an orange that's starting to get
[4734.08 - 4738.24] all the dense and it's getting the dense
[4736.32 - 4740.32] and it's getting soft like squishy it
[4738.24 - 4742.24] still could be a good orange ready watch
[4740.32 - 4744.96] this it still could be a good orange
[4742.24 - 4746.72] check this out looks amazing
[4744.96 - 4748.80] it's incredible
[4746.72 - 4750.80] it looks incredible but why did i tell
[4748.80 - 4751.84] you not to pick this orange
[4750.80 - 4754.64] like why
[4751.84 - 4755.60] it looks great but it's got the softness
[4754.64 - 4757.68] to it
[4755.60 - 4760.08] that's because when you buy a bunch of
[4757.68 - 4761.84] these and then you've got them in a bowl
[4760.08 - 4764.48] whether they're on the counter or even
[4761.84 - 4767.52] in the fridge in a week they're going to
[4764.48 - 4769.04] start going bad fast that's why unless
[4767.52 - 4770.88] you're going to eat them right now
[4769.04 - 4772.48] they're going to start going bad quick
[4770.88 - 4774.08] and when you buy oranges you want them
[4772.48 - 4775.60] to stick around you want to be able to
[4774.08 - 4777.60] have your oranges you want them to be
[4775.60 - 4780.64] able to stick around that's what you
[4777.60 - 4782.88] want to do and so what happens is is
[4780.64 - 4785.36] you know when you get those soft spots
[4782.88 - 4787.36] like that and it's soft all the soft
[4785.36 - 4789.60] different dents and everything
[4787.36 - 4792.24] you just you it's starting to get to a
[4789.60 - 4795.36] point where it's shifting gears it's
[4792.24 - 4795.36] starting to shift gears
[4795.76 - 4800.56] right so i'm doing juice from one orange
[4797.92 - 4804.52] but i cut two oranges why not
[4800.56 - 4804.52] i'm gonna pop that in here
[4804.56 - 4806.88] okay
[4809.44 - 4812.80] my screen keeps freezing
[4811.12 - 4814.96] adelina

[4819.76 - 4824.80] facebook freezes everything on me
[4822.56 - 4824.80] yeah
[4827.92 - 4832.96] they freeze everybody out

[4832.96 - 4835.60] back
[4833.92 - 4837.12] so they freeze people out to make them
[4835.60 - 4839.68] go away
[4837.12 - 4840.88] just go to rumble stay on there
[4839.68 - 4844.32] they're not going to freeze you out

[4884.00 - 4889.76] bit more of this orange skin
[4886.00 - 4891.52] but i'm not gonna do the pith
[4889.76 - 4892.72] right look at that

[5040.16 - 5043.92] and i was really proud of myself for not
[5042.16 - 5045.52] doing that for a long time because i was
[5043.92 - 5047.04] using a different tool
[5045.52 - 5049.92] in there but
[5047.04 - 5053.84] it looks like now i'm gonna have a red i
[5049.92 - 5055.68] mean a red wooden utensil
[5053.84 - 5057.28] so
[5055.68 - 5059.60] you were just arguing with mom about
[5057.28 - 5061.60] taking only half aisles
[5059.60 - 5064.08] darcy lee said i was just arguing with
[5061.60 - 5066.40] my mom about only letting them take half
[5064.08 - 5068.56] files she said they never heard of that
[5066.40 - 5070.16] i go of course they haven't
[5068.56 - 5072.64] now she feels horrible and i'm so
[5070.16 - 5074.00] frustrated
[5072.64 - 5075.84] anybody who doesn't know we're talking
[5074.00 - 5078.56] about medical mean podcast at apple
[5075.84 - 5080.56] podcast listen to the blood draw vampire
[5078.56 - 5082.08] bloodletting episode
[5080.56 - 5083.68] it's
[5082.08 - 5086.00] critical
[5083.68 - 5088.32] critical episode to hear could save a
[5086.00 - 5089.60] life could save your life
[5088.32 - 5092.08] and
[5089.60 - 5093.68] original medical medium information yes
[5092.08 - 5096.00] it's what's really funny guys is i'm not
[5093.68 - 5097.52] allowed to say oh
[5096.00 - 5099.84] it's medical medium information
[5097.52 - 5102.56] everybody gets mad
[5099.84 - 5105.36] but what am i gonna say if it's
[5102.56 - 5106.88] original medical medium information that
[5105.36 - 5109.36] comes from spirit of compassion and
[5106.88 - 5111.28] nobody knew before am i supposed to just
[5109.36 - 5113.84] pretend that's not really it and then i
[5111.28 - 5116.16] got it from somebody else when i didn't
[5113.84 - 5117.52] this smells amazing by the way amazing
[5116.16 - 5118.96] and it's cooking up really quick
[5117.52 - 5120.24] actually it's starting to cook up nice
[5118.96 - 5121.76] i'm gonna keep the lid on it because i
[5120.24 - 5123.68] want the juices to be in there while
[5121.76 - 5126.24] that is cooking
[5123.68 - 5129.20] and the thing is is how do you help
[5126.24 - 5130.80] somebody heal if you don't tell them
[5129.20 - 5132.64] about the original medical medium
[5130.80 - 5134.56] information right
[5132.64 - 5138.56] how are you going to help them find the
[5134.56 - 5140.96] rest of it someone can say epstein-barr
[5138.56 - 5143.04] but not know all the things they need to
[5140.96 - 5145.60] do to heal the problem or not know what
[5143.04 - 5147.12] epstein-barr causes it's just it's
[5145.60 - 5149.52] critical that people know where the
[5147.12 - 5150.48] original information comes from
[5149.52 - 5153.80] so
[5150.48 - 5153.80] all right so
[5154.64 - 5158.32] whoa those are cooking up nice brussels
[5157.04 - 5161.04] sprouts are almost done the maple
[5158.32 - 5161.04] brussels sprouts
[5164.80 - 5169.68] all right so
[5168.00 - 5171.52] let's move a little bit into where we're
[5169.68 - 5174.32] going next you guys
[5171.52 - 5176.96] we might plate some stuff up
[5174.32 - 5178.56] so i got these right here
[5176.96 - 5182.60] and i'm going to do some plating and i
[5178.56 - 5182.60] got a nice plate right here
[5184.32 - 5187.12] moving that over
[5189.60 - 5191.76] so
[5195.44 - 5200.16] these are really hot
[5197.12 - 5200.16] putting that one here
[5204.00 - 5209.76] those are hot
[5206.64 - 5211.68] i don't advise you to use your hands
[5209.76 - 5215.44] unless they've cooled down
[5211.68 - 5218.48] but i have for some reason an ability
[5215.44 - 5220.48] to stand really high intense heat with
[5218.48 - 5224.12] my hands
[5220.48 - 5224.12] since i was a child
[5228.16 - 5232.24] i mean i could grab hot potatoes like
[5230.00 - 5233.92] it's nothing
[5232.24 - 5235.92] right out of the steamer like it's
[5233.92 - 5239.24] nothing
[5235.92 - 5239.24] look at that
[5239.44 - 5242.24] so
[5240.80 - 5243.92] that's the big squash which is
[5242.24 - 5245.36] incredible now you can cut it like a
[5243.92 - 5247.36] pizza pie
[5245.36 - 5249.76] you can do it that way you can serve it
[5247.36 - 5252.64] like that you can take a knife and and
[5249.76 - 5255.04] cut it in pieces and serve it on
[5252.64 - 5257.28] you know an individual plate
[5255.04 - 5259.28] you can easily do that
[5257.28 - 5262.80] so that's one one way to do it too and
[5259.28 - 5262.80] i'll cut them up too in a little bit
[5263.12 - 5266.00] you can do this for thanksgiving you can
[5264.64 - 5268.08] do this for christmas what an incredible
[5266.00 - 5269.52] recipe it really is
[5268.08 - 5271.28] i'm gonna put a little bit of a garnish
[5269.52 - 5273.68] on top of this are you guys okay i might
[5271.28 - 5274.96] put a little parsley garnish on top got
[5273.68 - 5278.48] some beautiful
[5274.96 - 5278.48] leafy green parsley
[5279.20 - 5284.88] right leafy greens
[5283.12 - 5287.84] no one
[5284.88 - 5287.84] unfortunately
[5288.80 - 5292.16] knew
[5290.64 - 5295.76] that you can take these herbs and eat
[5292.16 - 5297.92] them in high quantity like a leafy green
[5295.76 - 5299.60] and you can and it's so great so i'm
[5297.92 - 5301.36] going to cut up a little bit of parsley
[5299.60 - 5303.76] you don't have to have a lot
[5301.36 - 5306.16] just a little bit it's fine
[5303.76 - 5308.24] i it blows people's minds every day it's
[5306.16 - 5310.72] like what do you mean a leafy green
[5308.24 - 5314.56] a salad like yeah it's called really
[5310.72 - 5316.40] having a big plate of cilantro and
[5314.56 - 5320.16] parsley and eating them like a leafy
[5316.40 - 5320.16] green that's a great way to heal
[5320.64 - 5324.64] let's put this on here put a little bit
[5322.56 - 5327.92] on here
[5324.64 - 5329.52] just right on top you don't need a lot
[5327.92 - 5331.60] for this
[5329.52 - 5333.20] because you're not having leafy greens
[5331.60 - 5335.12] in this meal really you're not do unless
[5333.20 - 5338.88] you make a big salad a leafy green salad
[5335.12 - 5338.88] but you're not having that kind of meal
[5340.16 - 5345.12] okay alessa says
[5342.08 - 5347.52] my neurologist says that i have to have
[5345.12 - 5350.32] sir my neurologist says that i have to
[5347.52 - 5353.12] have the blood draw drawn so that he can
[5350.32 - 5354.24] keep an eye on my levels
[5353.12 - 5358.56] right
[5354.24 - 5358.56] you should listen to medical medium
[5359.68 - 5366.80] look at the the blood draw podcast too
[5363.52 - 5366.80] and you did oh wait you did
[5370.96 - 5374.80] wait a minute let me
[5372.56 - 5376.80] hold on you know what's funny i got this
[5374.80 - 5380.32] thing cooking and cranking and i'm
[5376.80 - 5380.32] trying to keep an eye on it hold on
[5380.88 - 5384.48] there we go i turned the heat down the
[5382.48 - 5387.68] heat was really high for some reason on
[5384.48 - 5387.68] here and just pumping
[5388.08 - 5392.44] this is coming out really good
[5393.92 - 5398.72] what happens is doctors don't know they
[5395.44 - 5398.72] don't have to take a lot of blood
[5403.20 - 5407.92] i'm going to get a pop really quick i
[5406.40 - 5409.28] don't usually take a prop out during the
[5407.92 - 5410.88] medical medium cooking show but i'm
[5409.28 - 5411.76] going to do that for now
[5410.88 - 5413.20] and
[5411.76 - 5414.64] so i'll give you a little bit of
[5413.20 - 5417.04] information about this this will be
[5414.64 - 5417.04] interesting
[5418.72 - 5421.84] there we go
[5423.04 - 5426.24] that cranberry sauce is going to be done
[5424.64 - 5428.64] in just a couple of minutes which is
[5426.24 - 5428.64] incredible
[5430.88 - 5433.12] okay
[5432.08 - 5435.84] so
[5433.12 - 5435.84] let's just say that
[5437.60 - 5441.04] let's just say that the blood lab needed
[5439.20 - 5443.04] to test for something like an a a
[5441.04 - 5445.04] anti-nuclear antigen test
[5443.04 - 5447.36] thyroid panel
[5445.04 - 5450.32] a1c
[5447.36 - 5453.12] check out the kidneys
[5450.32 - 5454.88] sodium levels potassium levels
[5453.12 - 5457.68] a whole bit right
[5454.88 - 5460.16] nutritional a nutritional panel
[5457.68 - 5461.44] right a metabolic panel liver enzyme
[5460.16 - 5463.36] test the whole bit
[5461.44 - 5465.20] they only need this much blood
[5463.36 - 5466.80] that's all they need
[5465.20 - 5467.92] i'll show you guys on a close-up i don't
[5466.80 - 5469.68] think i've ever had ability to show you
[5467.92 - 5471.12] guys on a close-up they only need that
[5469.68 - 5473.60] much blood
[5471.12 - 5476.64] that's it
[5473.60 - 5479.52] they can take a speck of blood
[5476.64 - 5481.84] right smaller than that a speck like a
[5479.52 - 5483.04] speck you can't see on here like a speck
[5481.84 - 5485.04] and i'll put a speck you see i put a
[5483.04 - 5486.80] little green speck right there
[5485.04 - 5489.68] see a green speck
[5486.80 - 5491.84] they can take dehydrated blood
[5489.68 - 5494.32] from a murder scene
[5491.84 - 5496.80] 50 years ago on a pair of jeans that
[5494.32 - 5499.12] were buried in a shallow grave
[5496.80 - 5500.56] that only had a speck of blood on that
[5499.12 - 5502.00] pair of jeans
[5500.56 - 5504.56] way less than that
[5502.00 - 5507.52] and they can do a thyroid panel
[5504.56 - 5509.44] not metabolic panel a a
[5507.52 - 5513.12] they could do a lyme disease test they
[5509.44 - 5514.88] can do mt if mthfr gene mutation tests
[5513.12 - 5517.04] they can do everything sodium levels
[5514.88 - 5518.96] nutritional panels all of it
[5517.04 - 5520.40] just so you know
[5518.96 - 5523.20] check out medical medium podcasts at
[5520.40 - 5524.64] apple podcast the blood draw episode
[5523.20 - 5527.20] so important
[5524.64 - 5528.32] so important and
[5527.20 - 5530.72] so
[5528.32 - 5532.56] they take the blood on purpose
[5530.72 - 5534.08] they rob the blood on purpose
[5532.56 - 5535.52] and all it does is send people backwards
[5534.08 - 5537.20] and backwards and backwards so when i
[5535.52 - 5539.12] tell my friends and family ask for half
[5537.20 - 5541.04] files or quarter vials well i'll tell
[5539.12 - 5543.12] them to ask for quarter vials
[5541.04 - 5544.72] quarter vials they can fill up each tube
[5543.12 - 5546.96] with a quarter
[5544.72 - 5548.48] quarter tubes quarter each two quarter
[5546.96 - 5551.12] amount in each two
[5548.48 - 5553.44] so that you're not losing all of your
[5551.12 - 5556.16] blood they don't need a lot of blood to
[5553.44 - 5556.16] make a serum
[5556.56 - 5559.52] so what happens is that
[5558.32 - 5562.56] when you've got chronic illness and
[5559.52 - 5564.24] you're sick i mean that'll trash you
[5562.56 - 5565.44] next thing you know you're sicker and
[5564.24 - 5566.88] then sicker and then you lose your
[5565.44 - 5568.16] immune system and you're sicker and now
[5566.88 - 5569.20] you catch something and then you're
[5568.16 - 5570.24] sicker and then you lose your immune
[5569.20 - 5571.52] system and you're sick and they take
[5570.24 - 5572.32] more blood take more blood take more
[5571.52 - 5575.52] blood
[5572.32 - 5578.08] and that's what they do
[5575.52 - 5578.08] all right so
[5581.84 - 5585.92] yeah i think i added the orange but i'm
[5583.84 - 5587.12] double checking i think i did i think i
[5585.92 - 5590.72] added the orange i'm gonna add a little
[5587.12 - 5590.72] bit more there we go
[5594.80 - 5597.84] add a little bit more okay so this
[5596.40 - 5598.96] cranberry sauce looks like it's getting
[5597.84 - 5601.76] there i better check the brussels
[5598.96 - 5604.72] sprouts let's hope they're not burned
[5601.76 - 5604.72] those babies are done
[5605.68 - 5610.04] all right you guys i'm gonna take these
[5607.04 - 5610.04] out
[5621.20 - 5624.80] here they are
[5622.64 - 5626.56] right here
[5624.80 - 5628.56] they're not burnt they're just toasted
[5626.56 - 5630.00] up nice if i left them in there for 10
[5628.56 - 5632.24] more minutes they would probably start
[5630.00 - 5634.61] to burn but those are just toasted up
[5632.24 - 5637.73] nice right there
[5634.61 - 5637.73] [Music]
[5639.92 - 5643.44] cooling those down then i'm going to
[5641.04 - 5646.96] plate it up
