[2.80 - 8.48] UTI PID all kinds of different
[5.72 - 10.76] conditions urinary tract infections are
[8.48 - 14.68] on the rise up up up up they're not
[10.76 - 17.68] going down down down UTI are going up up
[14.68 - 20.68] and away the problem is with UTI they're
[17.68 - 24.76] not just going up they're going
[20.68 - 27.00] chronically crazy where women are
[24.76 - 29.44] suffering
[27.00 - 32.56] incredible suffering we're talking about
[29.44 - 34.36] devast dating suffering because of UTI
[32.56 - 36.80] chronic UTI that don't want to go
[34.36 - 40.40] anywhere because guess what the bacteria
[36.80 - 42.32] became super bacteria it is now a super
[40.40 - 44.64] bug that's what's happening so so many
[42.32 - 47.92] people are dealing dealing with chronic
[44.64 - 50.48] UTI they can't get past them they can't
[47.92 - 53.04] move forward it's just tormenting them
[50.48 - 56.60] and it doesn't go away same thing with
[53.04 - 60.20] pelvic inflammatory disease that too
[56.60 - 62.16] just keeps on tormenting women in such
[60.20 - 64.72] ways that is
[62.16 - 67.24] undescribable because words don't match
[64.72 - 69.24] the suffering they are suffering with so
[67.24 - 72.04] we're going into that UTI bladder
[69.24 - 75.76] infections kidney infections right
[72.04 - 79.76] urinary tract infections yeast
[75.76 - 83.56] infections yeast infections
[79.76 - 85.08] interesting yeast yeast yeast so funny
[83.56 - 86.84] thing about well it's nothing funny
[85.08 - 90.24] about it but the funny thing about yeast
[86.84 - 93.12] infections is it's not the yeast is not
[90.24 - 95.96] the real problem it is
[93.12 - 97.56] bacteria that's Underneath It All the
[95.96 - 99.96] yeast just the immune system is so
[97.56 - 102.92] challenged in that area that the the
[99.96 - 105.88] yeast just grows because it's growing
[102.92 - 108.40] because there's so much of an immune
[105.88 - 110.52] suppressive um situation happening in
[108.40 - 112.64] the bladder area the vaginal area all of
[110.52 - 115.32] that that the yeast just tends to
[112.64 - 118.96] explode but it's exploding because the
[115.32 - 120.80] bacteria is thriving and taking over
[118.96 - 122.84] we're talking about rep we're talking
[120.80 - 124.88] about bacteria we're talking about super
[122.84 - 126.76] bugs a little bit we're going into that
[124.88 - 129.48] and we're talking about UTI we're going
[126.76 - 130.96] to talk about solutions for UTI as well
[129.48 - 132.20] so that's going to be really helpful for
[130.96 - 134.36] a lot of people that are dealing with
[132.20 - 135.56] UTI you don't want to miss this episode
[134.36 - 138.24] this is an important one I'm even
[135.56 - 140.64] reading a little bit out of Liver Rescue
[138.24 - 143.44] a little bit out of cleanse the heel
[140.64 - 145.92] don't miss this do you know anybody
[143.44 - 148.48] struggling or suffering with UTI or have
[145.92 - 150.44] a history of UTI and now they have acne
[148.48 - 153.76] now they got sibo here's later they get
[150.44 - 155.72] sibo now they get PID now they got acne
[153.76 - 158.04] again then they got an ear infection
[155.72 - 159.16] then they got a sore throat and a strep
[158.04 - 162.04] throat
[159.16 - 165.76] problem yeah exactly strep strep strep
[162.04 - 168.00] strep strep strep strep exactly sio they
[165.76 - 170.56] never talk about what bacteria it is
[168.00 - 174.28] that creates small intestinal bacterial
[170.56 - 177.84] overgrowth but it's STP our good old
[174.28 - 180.20] friend strep hey strep how are you fine
[177.84 - 182.96] doing okay living in everybody body's
[180.20 - 186.24] lymphatic vessels living in everybody's
[182.96 - 189.68] pores living in everybody's throats
[186.24 - 193.08] living in everybody's buts yep you got
[189.68 - 195.88] it that's what happens strep is always
[193.08 - 198.56] hanging around people's anuses it's
[195.88 - 200.60] hanging around the rectums all the time
[198.56 - 203.00] that's where strep loves to be it's
[200.60 - 205.92] around everybody's throat it's in their
[203.00 - 207.72] mouth every day people have more than
[205.92 - 209.48] one variety two variety have three
[207.72 - 211.44] variety four variety five variety six
[209.48 - 214.60] variety seven variety they'll have 10
[211.44 - 218.56] varieties of strep some dormant some
[214.60 - 220.40] lowkey some much more serious creating
[218.56 - 225.20] everything from acne to
[220.40 - 227.96] sty yep sty thrush all that thrush on
[225.20 - 229.16] their tongue just causing problems so
[227.96 - 231.96] that's the whole thing there we're going
[229.16 - 234.48] into strep and we're going into UTI but
[231.96 - 237.56] let's hit the UTI problem because that
[234.48 - 241.32] is critical because I'm seeing it more
[237.56 - 244.48] and more years ago I didn't see it like
[241.32 - 247.84] it was today you'd have that antibiotic
[244.48 - 252.16] resistant UTI you'd have that out there
[247.84 - 256.16] I saw it out there okay but now it's
[252.16 - 258.96] unlike it's ever been it's never been to
[256.16 - 261.12] this degree I called it though and I saw
[258.96 - 263.40] it I've written about it that these bugs
[261.12 - 266.12] would actually take off to such a degree
[263.40 - 270.40] where they'd be antibiotic resistant but
[266.12 - 274.56] not just Mera not talking about Mera
[270.40 - 276.80] I'm talking about plain old Jane strep
[274.56 - 278.24] not MCA this is important to know this
[276.80 - 280.64] is a really good episode and we're going
[278.24 - 283.32] to talk about Solutions too which are
[280.64 - 286.88] critical um let's get into it a little
[283.32 - 289.12] bit the antibiotic dilemma do you guys
[286.88 - 293.08] uh love antibiotics antibiotics are the
[289.12 - 296.32] leading treatment for
[293.08 - 300.92] UTI antibiotics are the leading
[296.32 - 305.40] treatments for UTI you know that means
[300.92 - 307.52] that means decade after decade of bugs
[305.40 - 310.52] that are actually becoming
[307.52 - 313.28] immune to the
[310.52 - 316.56] antibiotic it's how it works and then
[313.28 - 319.48] that bug spreads to another person and
[316.56 - 322.64] so that person receives that bug and
[319.48 - 326.60] then now they have an antibiotic
[322.64 - 328.80] resistant bug they get sick and then
[326.60 - 333.04] they go to the doctor the doctor gives
[328.80 - 336.56] them an anti biotic again and now their
[333.04 - 339.80] bug is in them that's already antibiotic
[336.56 - 341.16] resistant is now even becoming more
[339.80 - 343.32] antibiotic
[341.16 - 346.20] resistant and
[343.32 - 348.84] the and then it keeps on going on and on
[346.20 - 351.64] and on and on so that's what's
[348.84 - 354.68] happening it's not like the old
[351.64 - 358.52] days and then the antibiotic kills the
[354.68 - 361.56] weakest bacteria but the Strong Survive
[358.52 - 365.08] so let's do this
[361.56 - 370.04] okay I was prepared for this one here we
[365.08 - 372.72] go okay you got a bacterium right here
[370.04 - 374.76] you got a bacterium right here got a
[372.72 - 376.28] bacterium right here and a bacterium
[374.76 - 378.00] right here and I'll even put another one
[376.28 - 382.12] right here and one more right here so
[378.00 - 385.56] these are bacteria okay so here we are
[382.12 - 388.00] take a look you guys these are inside
[385.56 - 390.40] the bladder or the kidneys so let's make
[388.00 - 393.04] a bladder here
[390.40 - 396.84] okay there we are we got a
[393.04 - 399.36] bladder right and in that bladder is a
[396.84 - 401.64] whole bunch of bacteria and strep
[399.36 - 404.72] bacteria is what it is okay so
[401.64 - 407.92] antibiotics are used all of a sudden
[404.72 - 410.28] boom we take an antibiotic the
[407.92 - 413.88] antibiotic is coming through right now
[410.28 - 416.28] here it goes there it is the antibiotic
[413.88 - 416.28] coming
[418.00 - 422.40] through there we go
[420.84 - 426.68] can't really see this good but there it
[422.40 - 429.68] is Boom the antibiotic came through then
[426.68 - 432.84] now we get some dead
[429.68 - 434.64] bacteria this one explodes Boom the
[432.84 - 438.56] antibiotic killed
[434.64 - 439.68] it boom Another One explodes boom
[438.56 - 442.48] Another One
[439.68 - 447.12] explodes interesting this one just gets
[442.48 - 448.52] maed that bacterium gets maimed this one
[447.12 - 451.60] just gets
[448.52 - 455.00] weakened am I yelling this one gets
[451.60 - 456.28] weakened okay this one doesn't get
[455.00 - 461.08] harmed at
[456.28 - 464.88] all all right we got a weakened
[461.08 - 469.12] bacterium we got a maed bacterium
[464.88 - 471.92] damaged but they survive they survive
[469.12 - 472.76] and they provide information now against
[471.92 - 477.72] that
[472.76 - 480.48] antibiotic they hold the key to survival
[477.72 - 483.48] against the antibiotic that was given to
[480.48 - 486.92] them think about that right now right
[483.48 - 489.56] and then you got one that survived it
[486.92 - 493.28] completely that also holds information
[489.56 - 495.40] but it's completely unharmed in fact it
[493.28 - 499.32] seemed to do good with the antibiotic
[495.40 - 500.56] that one little bug right there drank
[499.32 - 503.88] those
[500.56 - 507.36] antibiotics consumed them it didn't hurt
[503.88 - 510.24] them and now this one bug right here is
[507.36 - 512.80] getting stronger
[510.24 - 515.68] nice and strong now now it's a nice
[512.80 - 518.20] strong bacterium you see this the maed
[515.68 - 520.88] ones not as strong but they provide
[518.20 - 524.04] information and they stay alive is what
[520.88 - 526.64] they do they too survive it and they're
[524.04 - 529.56] a they survive it and the aftermath
[526.64 - 532.28] they're still hanging around okay and
[529.56 - 534.56] then another one too at the same time
[532.28 - 537.72] still survived it and it's it's there
[534.56 - 541.24] right so now you got three bacterium but
[537.72 - 544.96] three different bacter iums same
[541.24 - 547.72] bacteria but three different experiences
[544.96 - 549.12] three different strengths and three
[547.72 - 553.44] different
[549.12 - 555.60] injuries one not injured two one mimed
[553.44 - 559.36] one injured there's a problem with that
[555.60 - 562.12] though because then as it's producing
[559.36 - 565.00] more bacteria is being produced okay
[562.12 - 567.24] which happens more and more
[565.00 - 569.44] bacteria is being
[567.24 - 570.32] produced right here's your bacteria
[569.44 - 573.00] right
[570.32 - 576.00] here and these bacteria are getting
[573.00 - 578.92] stronger and producing the weak
[576.00 - 583.44] ones okay want to be as strong as the
[578.92 - 586.32] strong one so the weak ones become even
[583.44 - 588.24] stronger than the original strong one
[586.32 - 591.28] that wasn't even affected by the
[588.24 - 593.56] original back antibiotic okay this is
[591.28 - 596.36] important the weaker
[593.56 - 599.00] ones gain strength the ones that were
[596.36 - 601.40] maimed and injured by the an antibiotic
[599.00 - 603.96] keep that in mind they were maimed and
[601.40 - 608.72] injured and they
[603.96 - 612.00] now okay they strengthen they rise above
[608.72 - 614.84] it they gather information from their
[612.00 - 618.20] injuries they learn how to not get
[614.84 - 620.52] injured again by the antibiotic they
[618.20 - 623.56] become stronger than the one that
[620.52 - 627.00] survived completely without injury at
[623.56 - 630.84] all and that's a problem all on its own
[627.00 - 633.60] okay so now you have very strong
[630.84 - 637.20] bacteria here's the thing they get
[633.60 - 640.12] stronger they get stronger and
[637.20 - 646.24] then all
[640.12 - 649.60] right and then a new infection
[646.24 - 652.44] occurs they get stronger they override
[649.60 - 655.20] the immune system of the person drops
[652.44 - 657.56] exactly the immune system
[655.20 - 661.60] drops there's another bladder right
[657.56 - 664.60] there okay so white blood
[661.60 - 666.96] cells for some reason aren't as strong
[664.60 - 668.88] in that person their own white blood
[666.96 - 673.20] cells aren't doing the jobs they need to
[668.88 - 676.04] do they get triggered they get exposures
[673.20 - 680.40] something happens there and then the
[676.04 - 683.00] bacteria rise up and get stronger and
[680.40 - 685.16] now we have a new infection they
[683.00 - 687.88] reproduce I'm going to make a whole
[685.16 - 689.92] bunch of them here if you guys with me
[687.88 - 692.64] you're following me right now
[689.92 - 695.40] okay and then the new antibiotic comes
[692.64 - 698.20] through they're sick again and then a
[695.40 - 700.60] new wave of antibiotic comes through
[698.20 - 701.80] they're at the doctor's office they got
[700.60 - 704.96] a new
[701.80 - 706.96] UTI and then boom here comes the
[704.96 - 709.96] antibiotic it's rushing
[706.96 - 709.96] through
[710.84 - 716.92] okay and what happens is all these new
[714.96 - 721.36] bacteria
[716.92 - 724.92] right they don't budge everybody's happy
[721.36 - 727.24] they're stronger they supersede the
[724.92 - 729.76] antibiotic and then the doctor gets
[727.24 - 733.04] pissed the patients gets the patient
[729.76 - 735.16] gets pissed stays sick the doctor's
[733.04 - 738.80] pissed and then they change up the
[735.16 - 742.76] antibiotic get ready for this the new
[738.80 - 745.56] antibiotic gets then prescribed so here
[742.76 - 748.20] comes the new antibiotic coming through
[745.56 - 750.16] and this is what sucks right here really
[748.20 - 754.84] sucks it's comes
[750.16 - 757.56] through and then it mimes and injures a
[754.84 - 760.20] whole bunch of them that's right this
[757.56 - 763.08] one gets maed this one gets injured this
[760.20 - 766.64] one gets maed this one gets injured this
[763.08 - 769.28] one gets almost killed completely this
[766.64 - 772.76] one just gets slightly injured this one
[769.28 - 776.08] never gets touched okay that's
[772.76 - 780.28] fine here's the problem now we got a
[776.08 - 782.68] whole bunch of brand new streps
[780.28 - 784.96] and those brand new bacterium strep
[782.68 - 788.92] bacterium have
[784.96 - 791.92] information and survived a new
[788.92 - 793.72] antibiotic that is not good they
[791.92 - 797.08] survived a new
[793.72 - 798.76] antibiotic they're still alive now they
[797.08 - 801.40] have information from the original
[798.76 - 803.76] antibiotic how to survive survival
[801.40 - 806.88] instincts in the bacteria and now they
[803.76 - 809.88] got new information from the new
[806.88 - 812.72] antibiotic survival mechanis organisms
[809.88 - 815.76] kick in in that bacteria the
[812.72 - 816.88] bacteria does not want to lose so it's
[815.76 - 820.96] going to now
[816.88 - 824.48] supersede and then boom the next phase
[820.96 - 826.32] happens okay you got a patient that's
[824.48 - 828.40] getting a little better again the
[826.32 - 832.68] patient's getting a little bit
[828.40 - 832.68] better I really can't stand this
[833.60 - 841.48] whiteboard
[835.92 - 841.48] yep all right new bacteria it's
[841.72 - 848.84] reproducing here we
[843.92 - 851.80] go once again immune system drops in the
[848.84 - 856.44] patient the patient was getting
[851.80 - 859.00] better a month later two months later at
[856.44 - 860.60] some point okay there's the bladder
[859.00 - 863.36] again I'm just doing a bladder you do
[860.60 - 864.56] kidneys you can do you know urethras
[863.36 - 867.28] whatever
[864.56 - 870.20] so all
[867.28 - 872.04] right playing around mark ERS here so we
[870.20 - 875.32] got a new
[872.04 - 876.64] bacteria this bacteria has information
[875.32 - 879.16] from two
[876.64 - 882.64] antibiotics it has survived two
[879.16 - 885.44] antibiotics yes it has indeed and it has
[882.64 - 887.56] survived the person's immune
[885.44 - 889.88] system that's the whole point it
[887.56 - 891.76] survived their immune system and it
[889.88 - 894.20] survived the antibiotic involved in
[891.76 - 897.12] their immune system okay both with the
[894.20 - 899.16] immune system working on that working
[897.12 - 900.84] with that antibiotic and both with with
[899.16 - 903.64] that antibiotic okay so get ready for
[900.84 - 907.08] this person gets sick again they got
[903.64 - 909.20] another eiti it's pretty darn serious
[907.08 - 911.28] they're in pain they got a fever they
[909.20 - 913.16] don't know if they got kidney infections
[911.28 - 916.28] bladder
[913.16 - 919.28] infections and here we go there might be
[916.28 - 922.40] some blood in the urine
[919.28 - 925.92] right goes to the doctor doctor
[922.40 - 927.96] prescribes an antibiotic the same one
[925.92 - 930.24] that they used last time so you fill
[927.96 - 932.12] your prescription now you're taking it
[930.24 - 934.32] antibiotic runs through the body it's
[932.12 - 936.68] triggering the immune system immune
[934.32 - 938.00] cells you're trying to work with it it's
[936.68 - 939.16] trying to work with everything it's
[938.00 - 942.28] going
[939.16 - 943.36] through okay and this time now with this
[942.28 - 946.00] new
[943.36 - 947.96] antibiotic it's only killing off this
[946.00 - 950.40] one only killing off that one only
[947.96 - 953.64] killing off that one that one that one
[950.40 - 955.24] that one but this one right here is just
[953.64 - 957.28] injured that one's injured that one's
[955.24 - 959.80] injured that's one's injured injured
[957.28 - 962.60] maimed and we get the whole thing over
[959.80 - 965.20] again all the maed and injured ones say
[962.60 - 967.96] I'm not going to do this anymore I'm not
[965.20 - 971.24] going to let this antibiotic this new
[967.96 - 973.88] antibiotic rule the roost and clean us
[971.24 - 975.04] out we have to Rise Above This and we
[973.88 - 977.92] have to get
[975.04 - 981.08] stronger and then what happens is the
[977.92 - 985.80] new reproduction of that of that
[981.08 - 988.32] bacterium is even stronger so that the
[985.80 - 990.84] next phase of the antibiotic on the
[988.32 - 992.24] fourth r which happens all the time and
[990.84 - 994.84] sometimes it's a sixth round and
[992.24 - 998.08] sometimes it's a seventh another one's
[994.84 - 1001.32] prescribed here we
[998.08 - 1004.88] go and now none of the bacteria are
[1001.32 - 1005.92] budging at all got a fever there's blood
[1004.88 - 1009.04] in the
[1005.92 - 1011.16] urine kidneys are inflamed they have to
[1009.04 - 1014.16] give steroids out now so now it's
[1011.16 - 1015.92] steroids plus the new antibiotic so here
[1014.16 - 1017.84] we go doctor's got to play the game
[1015.92 - 1021.56] again and here it
[1017.84 - 1024.88] comes all right now it's
[1021.56 - 1024.88] time to
[1025.32 - 1030.88] use now it's time to use the new
[1028.60 - 1033.24] antibiotic all right so we got this
[1030.88 - 1034.64] bacteria that bacteria that bacteria
[1033.24 - 1038.00] that one right there that one right
[1034.64 - 1038.00] there here we go here's all the
[1038.40 - 1043.92] bacteria yep we got another bladder
[1041.88 - 1045.04] we'll just do bladder here we go there's
[1043.92 - 1049.44] the
[1045.04 - 1052.68] bladder now the doctor has to bring in
[1049.44 - 1055.24] the super antibiotic one with a lot of
[1052.68 - 1057.24] side effects one that causes a lot of
[1055.24 - 1060.40] problems one that also says a lot of
[1057.24 - 1063.52] terrible thing things on the side effect
[1060.40 - 1065.84] package the little roll out and here we
[1063.52 - 1072.60] go here it
[1065.84 - 1072.60] comes boom boom boom bo bo I'm taking my
[1074.04 - 1079.64] antibiotic
[1076.12 - 1083.48] right the super antibiotic
[1079.64 - 1085.36] the Super One a change
[1083.48 - 1090.28] up
[1085.36 - 1093.00] okay injures this guy kills off this guy
[1090.28 - 1095.48] mimes this guy injures this guy kills
[1093.00 - 1098.96] off this guy doesn't even touch that guy
[1095.48 - 1101.88] that guy and that guy now you got three
[1098.96 - 1103.28] guys here not even being touched by the
[1101.88 - 1106.08] super
[1103.28 - 1107.76] antibiotic but you still got injured but
[1106.08 - 1111.20] not dead
[1107.76 - 1114.16] bacteria injured but not dead bacteria
[1111.20 - 1116.72] you got some dead
[1114.16 - 1118.84] bacteria but too many
[1116.72 - 1122.64] injured too many
[1118.84 - 1126.00] injured and too many maimed but still
[1122.64 - 1128.28] survived and others that didn't even get
[1126.00 - 1131.12] affected and then we got a big problem
[1128.28 - 1134.96] so now they reproduce
[1131.12 - 1139.24] again after the Super antibiotic went
[1134.96 - 1143.20] through they reproduce this time we're
[1139.24 - 1146.12] in trouble now big trouble here we are
[1143.20 - 1148.76] because they use the super antibiotic
[1146.12 - 1152.16] again and then they have that running
[1148.76 - 1155.08] through and now these
[1152.16 - 1158.64] bacteria they are messaging they Cod it
[1155.08 - 1162.60] they have information they're
[1158.64 - 1165.92] superpowered they do not not give up at
[1162.60 - 1167.72] this point they have information of four
[1165.92 - 1170.52] to five different
[1167.72 - 1173.20] antibiotics
[1170.52 - 1175.72] and they don't want to budge anymore
[1173.20 - 1178.32] they put their foot down they're done
[1175.72 - 1181.12] that means they don't budge so then the
[1178.32 - 1183.84] doctor has to run another
[1181.12 - 1187.28] antibiotic brings that one
[1183.84 - 1190.44] through and now the patient is just
[1187.28 - 1193.72] chronically sick chronically suffering
[1190.44 - 1196.00] and chronically sick a super buug has
[1193.72 - 1196.00] been
[1197.64 - 1205.32] born the patient has the
[1201.72 - 1208.92] superbug whether it's a male
[1205.32 - 1211.96] female the patient has a superbug and
[1208.92 - 1215.16] then the patient has a
[1211.96 - 1217.68] relationship or the patient is a chef
[1215.16 - 1219.88] working in a restaurant who cuts their
[1217.68 - 1221.24] finger and then bleeds on three
[1219.88 - 1222.76] different meals that you can't really
[1221.24 - 1224.24] tell because a lot of the chefs they we
[1222.76 - 1226.72] the black gloves they put the black
[1224.24 - 1228.04] gloves on they throw a bandage on put a
[1226.72 - 1229.80] black glove on there's still blood
[1228.04 - 1233.08] everywhere and get working really quick
[1229.80 - 1235.80] they wipe their hands and or it's a
[1233.08 - 1238.48] relationship sexual interactions of some
[1235.80 - 1240.80] kind and then that super bug now gets
[1238.48 - 1243.24] transferred onto someone else with all
[1240.80 - 1245.84] this information and all this messaging
[1243.24 - 1248.44] and that information or the shopping
[1245.84 - 1250.40] cart shopping cart's a big one I've been
[1248.44 - 1254.52] saying this for decades you guys heard
[1250.40 - 1257.88] me say it years ago before c came around
[1254.52 - 1259.80] the shopping cart is a big one okay lots
[1257.88 - 1262.44] of different back bacteria on there lots
[1259.80 - 1264.72] of strep lots of Staff lots of Cs L lots
[1262.44 - 1267.60] of Mera lots of other stuff too but the
[1264.72 - 1270.36] strep is just crazy on the shopping cart
[1267.60 - 1273.72] handles crazy that's how much is on
[1270.36 - 1275.60] there okay so with that if they swabbed
[1273.72 - 1278.36] if they did a swab in a p tree dish if
[1275.60 - 1280.32] they did that with off the shopping cart
[1278.36 - 1283.96] handles you wouldn't believe what would
[1280.32 - 1285.04] grow wouldn't believe it so you're
[1283.96 - 1286.56] sitting there with a shopping cart
[1285.04 - 1288.20] handle you're not using handy wipes
[1286.56 - 1290.52] you're not doing an alcohol handy wipe
[1288.20 - 1291.60] across the handle you're you don't
[1290.52 - 1293.28] you're you're not thinking about
[1291.60 - 1294.40] anything you don't care about anything
[1293.28 - 1295.60] maybe you're just somebody that thinks
[1294.40 - 1297.16] that your immune system will get
[1295.60 - 1299.28] stronger because of it you won't have to
[1297.16 - 1301.32] worry because hey who cares I can just
[1299.28 - 1303.12] eat bugs and have bugs all over my skin
[1301.32 - 1305.20] it's just all that whole thing that
[1303.12 - 1308.20] philosophy that philosophy right it
[1305.20 - 1309.48] makes you stronger you become immune to
[1308.20 - 1311.44] it or something like that that's not
[1309.48 - 1313.36] true that's not how it works the more
[1311.44 - 1315.36] exposure you get to these bugs the more
[1313.36 - 1317.84] exposure you get the more bugs you get
[1315.36 - 1320.00] the more problems you have and then that
[1317.84 - 1321.60] it doesn't work that way where we're
[1320.00 - 1322.96] just all of a sudden hey I'm immune to
[1321.60 - 1325.80] everything and that's what I want all
[1322.96 - 1327.88] these bugs no it does not work like that
[1325.80 - 1330.52] tell that to someone who got you know
[1327.88 - 1332.04] Herpes Simplex 2 tell that to someone
[1330.52 - 1334.28] who's got something else that they
[1332.04 - 1336.44] caught from somebody it doesn't make you
[1334.28 - 1338.92] stronger it's not how it works it's a
[1336.44 - 1342.28] hassle it's all a hassle so then that
[1338.92 - 1344.48] strep then that super bug gets into
[1342.28 - 1347.64] somebody else through a shopping cart H
[1344.48 - 1350.76] handle through a public bathroom off the
[1347.64 - 1354.04] toilet seat off the dispenser whatever
[1350.76 - 1357.64] it is and they get it and they get the
[1354.04 - 1360.52] bug that's superpowered it is a super
[1357.64 - 1361.24] version of itself it already knows all
[1360.52 - 1363.36] the
[1361.24 - 1365.40] antibiotics it already knows about them
[1363.36 - 1367.80] all that means when you come down with
[1365.40 - 1370.20] something or you get sick or something
[1367.80 - 1373.00] happens and now you got a UTI whatever
[1370.20 - 1375.16] it may be you go to the doctor and the
[1373.00 - 1376.60] process starts all over again but the
[1375.16 - 1379.08] doctor starts giving you that first
[1376.60 - 1381.12] round of antibiotics and it won't budge
[1379.08 - 1382.44] so easy especially if you have a
[1381.12 - 1383.88] compromised immune system and you're
[1382.44 - 1385.04] already struggling with something it
[1383.88 - 1387.32] won't
[1385.04 - 1389.64] budge and they're just like why do you
[1387.32 - 1392.36] have these UTI all of a sudden or say
[1389.64 - 1394.16] you know someone has someone has sex
[1392.36 - 1397.00] with somebody else and you know it's
[1394.16 - 1400.40] unprotective even if it's even if it's
[1397.00 - 1402.76] protected sex it's still easy to
[1400.40 - 1405.12] transfer these like these um these
[1402.76 - 1406.72] streps and this bacteria and all a
[1405.12 - 1408.96] sudden now there's a new UTI somebody
[1406.72 - 1411.56] has that never had before
[1408.96 - 1413.96] and now but it's an anti-resistant it's
[1411.56 - 1417.00] a what is it antibiotic resistant is
[1413.96 - 1419.20] what I mean version of itself that has
[1417.00 - 1422.32] all this information that's coded that's
[1419.20 - 1425.36] got all this Intel that survived all
[1422.32 - 1427.68] these antibiotics that knows them well
[1425.36 - 1430.60] so now we have another person with a
[1427.68 - 1433.12] super bug and just as Grim as it sounds
[1430.60 - 1434.72] it's not Grim when you know how to heal
[1433.12 - 1437.24] and use tools and that's the thing about
[1434.72 - 1439.92] medical medium information it's the one
[1437.24 - 1442.96] place where people that are the sickest
[1439.92 - 1445.12] come to find answers and it's not all
[1442.96 - 1448.72] that biohack [ __ ] out there that's
[1445.12 - 1450.84] going on it's real it's the real deal
[1448.72 - 1452.56] it's real answers real information on
[1450.84 - 1454.44] how to heal what to do and that's
[1452.56 - 1455.92] medical medium information and that's
[1454.44 - 1457.24] how it's always been people can be
[1455.92 - 1458.96] jealous out there and they can rip it
[1457.24 - 1460.60] apart or say what they want about it it
[1458.96 - 1463.16] Stills the most people healed in the
[1460.60 - 1464.84] world to the most chronic conditions and
[1463.16 - 1467.44] this is why knowing about this
[1464.84 - 1470.44] information not just biohacking crap on
[1467.44 - 1472.08] social and just this this this and try
[1470.44 - 1473.52] this it's for people who have been there
[1472.08 - 1475.68] and done that they're seasoned and they
[1473.52 - 1478.20] know so what happens is there is hope so
[1475.68 - 1479.44] when these super bugs the super strap
[1478.20 - 1481.96] gets to somebody else and they're
[1479.44 - 1483.96] fighting these these battling these UTI
[1481.96 - 1486.52] and it seems hopeless there are women
[1483.96 - 1489.36] out there with chronic UTI every day of
[1486.52 - 1492.36] their lives going into overactive
[1489.36 - 1495.16] bladder going into chronic UTI
[1492.36 - 1498.48] overactive bladder pain in their kidneys
[1495.16 - 1502.56] pain in their back p and then it attack
[1498.48 - 1505.24] on acne and sore throats and sio because
[1502.56 - 1507.92] they all get a sibo diagnosis eventually
[1505.24 - 1510.36] tack on to all all those in there and
[1507.92 - 1512.52] they're living with these Super Bug
[1510.36 - 1513.84] streps it's happening more and more out
[1512.52 - 1516.04] there and there are more people living
[1513.84 - 1516.88] with this than ever before now there is
[1516.04 - 1519.96] an
[1516.88 - 1522.52] upsurge that's getting out of control a
[1519.96 - 1524.96] serious upsurge and that
[1522.52 - 1526.56] upsurge is not going to stop it's going
[1524.96 - 1528.04] to keep on going unless people know how
[1526.56 - 1530.88] to arm themselves and take care of
[1528.04 - 1532.88] themselves and know how to fight feed
[1530.88 - 1534.28] their bodies what they need do the right
[1532.88 - 1536.52] things giving their bodies what their
[1534.28 - 1539.48] need so they can they can beat this
[1536.52 - 1541.44] Super Bug stuff down because it's no
[1539.48 - 1544.68] joke right now cuz people are passing
[1541.44 - 1547.32] these along and it's out of control
[1544.68 - 1549.04] people need the right information
[1547.32 - 1550.72] there's cleanse the heel right here in
[1549.04 - 1553.40] front of me and in cleanse the heel I
[1550.72 - 1555.76] got pelvic inflammatory disease right
[1553.40 - 1558.68] and even you know PID right and even
[1555.76 - 1561.16] prostatis got that there too I'm talking
[1558.68 - 1563.64] about bladder infections UTI all of that
[1561.16 - 1566.28] in here so it's cleanse to heal people
[1563.64 - 1568.44] need this book they need the
[1566.28 - 1569.72] information I have Liver Rescue in front
[1568.44 - 1571.76] of me right here I want to read a little
[1569.72 - 1573.12] bit about this for a couple of minutes
[1571.76 - 1575.80] if you guys don't
[1573.12 - 1578.28] mind the story of
[1575.80 - 1581.72] strep is what I was just telling you
[1578.28 - 1583.72] guys that's the story of strep right now
[1581.72 - 1587.56] in this modern day what people are
[1583.72 - 1589.96] dealing with and how bad it is okay most
[1587.56 - 1591.44] people stress starts in childhood they
[1589.96 - 1594.08] get the ear infections they get the
[1591.44 - 1596.72] strep throat the sore throats it starts
[1594.08 - 1599.36] earlier on it strep passed down from the
[1596.72 - 1601.44] parents a lot of times and it's strep
[1599.36 - 1603.64] that's passed down to the parents and
[1601.44 - 1605.72] then the children the B the children
[1603.64 - 1607.04] have it and the children pass it to each
[1605.72 - 1609.80] other in
[1607.04 - 1612.04] school and so it's it's strep being
[1609.80 - 1615.56] passed around everywhere that's what it
[1612.04 - 1618.24] is but that could be fine in some ways
[1615.56 - 1619.96] but in others it's antibiotic resist
[1618.24 - 1621.48] resistance STP that's being passed
[1619.96 - 1623.00] around going to each person and that
[1621.48 - 1625.20] takes us to the next level of
[1623.00 - 1629.08] understanding which I want to go to
[1625.20 - 1631.36] now which is the immune system okay
[1629.08 - 1634.64] that's the next thing every time SHP
[1631.36 - 1638.44] enters into somebody and battles our
[1634.64 - 1641.40] immune cells and it survives so anytime
[1638.44 - 1645.92] SHP enters into each person and it goes
[1641.40 - 1648.88] into war with our immune cells right
[1645.92 - 1650.48] here goes into war every time that
[1648.88 - 1653.76] happens and there's a
[1650.48 - 1656.28] battle and the strep survives it has
[1653.76 - 1658.88] information so when that strep is passed
[1656.28 - 1661.80] onto another person it's not just
[1658.88 - 1664.16] antibiotics it's also relationships with
[1661.80 - 1667.72] the immune system of the person it was
[1664.16 - 1670.20] in this whole time so then when that STP
[1667.72 - 1672.72] gets passed on to somebody else it's
[1670.20 - 1675.76] getting passed on to somebody else with
[1672.72 - 1678.56] information on that person's immune
[1675.76 - 1681.24] system information of how it survived
[1678.56 - 1684.72] the battle with that person's white
[1681.24 - 1687.72] count and so when that strep is in the
[1684.72 - 1689.96] new person the strep now has a way to
[1687.72 - 1691.64] beat immune systems it goes into another
[1689.96 - 1694.04] person another person's immune system
[1691.64 - 1696.84] goes up against it there it goes it's in
[1694.04 - 1698.76] battle the the bacteria survives why do
[1696.84 - 1701.24] you think people keep on getting acne
[1698.76 - 1703.08] all over again you still have some strep
[1701.24 - 1705.72] surviving why do you think they keep on
[1703.08 - 1707.12] getting the UTI over again the bladder
[1705.72 - 1712.24] infections the
[1707.12 - 1714.04] overactive ladder right that one too OAB
[1712.24 - 1716.40] they keep on getting these things and
[1714.04 - 1717.96] then the thigh and then the sore throats
[1716.40 - 1719.44] and then the strep throat periodically
[1717.96 - 1721.96] and then the ear aches and ear
[1719.44 - 1723.32] infections or they get exposed to new
[1721.96 - 1726.80] strains and that's another story and
[1723.32 - 1728.44] we'll go into that too the strep has
[1726.80 - 1730.96] information of the person's immune
[1728.44 - 1733.36] system information of the antibiotics
[1730.96 - 1735.48] the other person took they take it to
[1733.36 - 1738.68] the next person the next person's immune
[1735.48 - 1741.88] cells go against it they go into battle
[1738.68 - 1744.08] what survives is Boom the bacteria again
[1741.88 - 1746.56] some of it survives it gets passed on to
[1744.08 - 1748.76] a new person with now immune system
[1746.56 - 1750.84] information from two others now here's
[1748.76 - 1752.76] where it gets really
[1750.84 - 1756.92] intense that
[1752.76 - 1761.20] bacteria can go through a 100 people and
[1756.92 - 1764.60] gather information from their immune
[1761.20 - 1769.00] systems of that 100
[1764.60 - 1772.60] people that's how super bugs are made
[1769.00 - 1775.52] it's not just the antibiotic over
[1772.60 - 1777.80] usage and then the UN and then not being
[1775.52 - 1779.12] taught how to heal and get rid of the
[1777.80 - 1782.32] bacteria
[1779.12 - 1786.36] naturally it's also information from
[1782.32 - 1791.72] each person's immune cells to each
[1786.36 - 1795.40] person and that bug becomes one
[1791.72 - 1796.84] Unstoppable brutal bug and that's why
[1795.40 - 1800.12] there are women out there young women in
[1796.84 - 1802.68] their 20s and in their early 30s that
[1800.12 - 1805.92] are in tears on a daily basis and they
[1802.68 - 1809.64] are so sick and they have so much
[1805.92 - 1812.52] UTI chronic UTI going on they have so
[1809.64 - 1815.56] much overactive bladder UTI kidney
[1812.52 - 1817.24] infection sore throats molay tired
[1815.56 - 1818.68] fatigue everything else Under the Sun
[1817.24 - 1820.36] with it and they're suffering and
[1818.68 - 1821.72] they're bleeding they're on antibiotics
[1820.36 - 1823.00] again their stomach's being ripped to
[1821.72 - 1825.00] shreds from the
[1823.00 - 1827.56] antibiotics then they get their sibo
[1825.00 - 1829.60] diagnosis and it's all around the same
[1827.56 - 1830.80] old thing more antibiotics for that and
[1829.60 - 1833.24] they're
[1830.80 - 1835.72] suffering and then
[1833.24 - 1837.16] because they got a strep inside of them
[1835.72 - 1838.92] that could have been through a hundred
[1837.16 - 1842.08] people that was passed on to them one
[1838.92 - 1844.68] way or another and that strep is smart
[1842.08 - 1847.44] it's smart it knows the immune cell
[1844.68 - 1850.00] information from dozens of people it
[1847.44 - 1853.24] knows the antibiotic information from
[1850.00 - 1855.32] dozens of people and it carries it with
[1853.24 - 1857.24] it and we have to know how to destroy
[1855.32 - 1860.92] that bacteria and how to kill it and
[1857.24 - 1862.64] what to use that it is not immune to
[1860.92 - 1865.44] because that's the key right medical
[1862.64 - 1868.56] medium information is always about the
[1865.44 - 1873.36] cause cuz guess what they didn't know
[1868.56 - 1876.00] strep was a UTI problem they didn't know
[1873.36 - 1878.40] strep was other problems they knew about
[1876.00 - 1881.64] strep throat but they didn't know strep
[1878.40 - 1884.40] created acne they didn't know it created
[1881.64 - 1886.64] sty did they didn't know it created UTI
[1884.40 - 1889.64] by the way that's medical medium
[1886.64 - 1890.96] information but it does it's just coming
[1889.64 - 1892.08] out people are poaching it and it's
[1890.96 - 1893.44] going out there and it's just getting
[1892.08 - 1894.56] out there every day just like you guys
[1893.44 - 1896.16] are probably seeing because I know you
[1894.56 - 1897.60] guys are telling me you see it every day
[1896.16 - 1901.00] we see it every
[1897.60 - 1903.32] day but the point is is that bacteria we
[1901.00 - 1905.92] have to learn how to kill it you have to
[1903.32 - 1908.92] identify it and know there's a cause
[1905.92 - 1909.92] behind your PID there's a cause behind
[1908.92 - 1913.44] your
[1909.92 - 1916.88] UTI there's a cause Behind these
[1913.44 - 1919.64] things and there's a way to kill and
[1916.88 - 1922.40] destroy kill and destroy the
[1919.64 - 1924.92] bacteria even bacterium that is
[1922.40 - 1927.28] antibiotic resistant and knows a crap
[1924.92 - 1929.48] ton of people's immune systems that
[1927.28 - 1931.28] understands all these people's immune
[1929.48 - 1932.20] systems that that bacteria was in all
[1931.28 - 1936.08] this
[1932.20 - 1938.00] time understands it is it expert at
[1936.08 - 1940.80] immune systems because that's what the
[1938.00 - 1943.84] bacteria becomes it becomes an expert at
[1940.80 - 1947.20] everybody's white count immune cells all
[1943.84 - 1950.00] of it it knows it all it's been in too
[1947.20 - 1951.56] many people it hasn't been destroyed and
[1950.00 - 1953.12] it's gotten stronger and stronger now
[1951.56 - 1955.40] it's a super bug and that's where it's
[1953.12 - 1957.00] at and that's happening now every day
[1955.40 - 1959.52] and we think these super bugs are bad
[1957.00 - 1960.64] now wait till the next round of UTI 10
[1959.52 - 1964.24] years from
[1960.64 - 1968.08] now and all the young men and women it's
[1964.24 - 1970.88] going to be like nobody's ever seen ever
[1968.08 - 1972.72] seen it's going to be that bad it's
[1970.88 - 1976.12] going to be bleeding as normal
[1972.72 - 1978.72] constantly bleeding catheters constantly
[1976.12 - 1981.04] on catheters that's another thing too so
[1978.72 - 1983.16] the UTI are getting to a point where all
[1981.04 - 1985.60] these young women are are literally
[1983.16 - 1988.24] living with
[1985.60 - 1991.84] catheters that's how bad it
[1988.24 - 1993.16] is and so we have to be mindful and
[1991.84 - 1994.56] understand that there is a way to beat
[1993.16 - 1995.92] it and there is a way to do we're going
[1994.56 - 1998.08] to talk about that in a little bit but I
[1995.92 - 2002.32] want to read a little if I
[1998.08 - 2005.24] can okay maybe most people strep starts
[2002.32 - 2008.24] in childhood maybe even pass down from a
[2005.24 - 2010.08] parent at conception yes a new born can
[2008.24 - 2012.16] enter the world with strep already in
[2010.08 - 2015.04] her or his
[2012.16 - 2017.96] system a child can also get strep from
[2015.04 - 2019.36] daycare or school and it's easily passed
[2017.96 - 2022.64] from child to
[2019.36 - 2025.08] child it really is as well as adult to
[2022.64 - 2028.04] adult because strep is a type of
[2025.08 - 2030.24] bacterium antibiotics do seem like the
[2028.04 - 2032.88] obvious choice to treat it but here's
[2030.24 - 2035.96] the crucial point that I talked about to
[2032.88 - 2039.04] know about strep long ago before
[2035.96 - 2040.44] antibiotic Revolution before antibiotics
[2039.04 - 2042.60] long ago you guys this is really
[2040.44 - 2045.88] interesting right here before the
[2042.60 - 2049.32] antibiotic was born long
[2045.88 - 2053.56] ago strep used to be one strain of
[2049.32 - 2055.80] bacterium strep was one strain of
[2053.56 - 2057.08] bacterium which takes us to this next
[2055.80 - 2060.48] part right here now this is really
[2057.08 - 2062.80] important okay this is
[2060.48 - 2064.80] important very
[2062.80 - 2066.72] important going to bring this around for
[2064.80 - 2070.32] a second
[2066.72 - 2074.68] okay all right
[2070.32 - 2078.32] so five antibiotics ago 10 antibiotics
[2074.68 - 2080.08] ago 10 different people ago the bacteria
[2078.32 - 2084.44] look like
[2080.08 - 2088.84] this right but then it changes a new
[2084.44 - 2093.12] strain is is is created along
[2088.84 - 2096.76] with the superbug power it alters and
[2093.12 - 2098.96] turns into a different bug now we have
[2096.76 - 2100.84] the old strain
[2098.96 - 2103.48] that's way in the past and it's in other
[2100.84 - 2105.80] people we got the new
[2103.48 - 2110.00] strain and there it
[2105.80 - 2110.00] is right there that new
[2111.00 - 2115.84] strain becomes another new strain
[2113.40 - 2118.44] eventually another new strain another
[2115.84 - 2121.24] new strain but here's the thing if you
[2118.44 - 2124.08] pass on this strain that it became to
[2121.24 - 2126.24] another person through sex or through
[2124.08 - 2128.96] drinking from somebody's glass or from
[2126.24 - 2130.68] being in a bar and eating something or
[2128.96 - 2132.48] whatever you're doing in a restaurant or
[2130.68 - 2134.36] on a shopping cart in a shopping cart or
[2132.48 - 2135.64] in a public bathroom or so many other
[2134.36 - 2138.76] ways you can do
[2135.64 - 2142.20] this if you pass on that strep bacteria
[2138.76 - 2145.24] to somebody in that in that strain to
[2142.20 - 2148.44] them they'll have that
[2145.24 - 2151.80] strain and they may keep that strain but
[2148.44 - 2155.96] it'll be that strain okay these in this
[2151.80 - 2159.64] person can still alter and become a new
[2155.96 - 2161.56] strain in a few few years that new
[2159.64 - 2163.72] strain can be passed on to another
[2161.56 - 2165.36] person and then they'll have that
[2163.72 - 2168.88] strain
[2165.36 - 2168.88] see that's how it
[2171.20 - 2178.32] works men can get UTI too and they do
[2174.80 - 2179.80] but they don't have a cycle men do not
[2178.32 - 2183.28] have
[2179.80 - 2184.76] menstration they do not have a cycle so
[2183.28 - 2186.60] they don't have the immune system
[2184.76 - 2187.92] lowering thing that happens so what
[2186.60 - 2189.48] happens is when a woman goes through
[2187.92 - 2191.92] menstruation and she has her cycle her
[2189.48 - 2193.84] monthly cycle her immune system drops
[2191.92 - 2195.44] and 80% of her immune system goes to the
[2193.84 - 2197.52] reproductive system that's medical me
[2195.44 - 2199.16] information 20% stays around the body
[2197.52 - 2200.88] for the rest of the body the
[2199.16 - 2203.12] reproductive system is the number one
[2200.88 - 2206.08] Focus that time of month where it's the
[2203.12 - 2209.32] number one Focus for the immune system
[2206.08 - 2211.08] think about that right so because of
[2209.32 - 2212.88] that the immune system is so focused
[2211.08 - 2216.24] around the reproductive
[2212.88 - 2220.00] system okay that it's easy to catch STP
[2216.24 - 2221.56] orally very easy to catch it orally or
[2220.00 - 2223.20] in the eyes where the immune system
[2221.56 - 2225.20] isn't there to destroy it right off the
[2223.20 - 2227.12] running so if there's some kind of
[2225.20 - 2228.60] relationship or a shopping cart like I
[2227.12 - 2230.12] said or a public bathroom and something
[2228.60 - 2234.16] goes in the eye or something gets in the
[2230.12 - 2236.16] mouth whatever it is during the cycle
[2234.16 - 2238.84] 80% of the immune system isn't around
[2236.16 - 2241.84] the mouth it's not there so for a woman
[2238.84 - 2246.16] it's not here it's down here so the
[2241.84 - 2247.76] strep can easily start its its beginning
[2246.16 - 2249.84] in the mouth in the throat and the so
[2247.76 - 2251.84] for so forth in that area so that
[2249.84 - 2252.68] happens too all right let's go into just
[2251.84 - 2256.32] a little
[2252.68 - 2260.20] bit all right here's the crucial point
[2256.32 - 2262.76] to know about strep long ago before the
[2260.20 - 2265.40] antibiotic Revolution I'm reading out of
[2262.76 - 2266.72] Liver Rescue if you guys never seen
[2265.40 - 2268.76] these books you don't know about these
[2266.72 - 2270.80] books you should get both of them go to
[2268.76 - 2273.64] Amazon get both be the best thing you
[2270.80 - 2276.44] ever did become an expert about your own
[2273.64 - 2280.52] health learn how to
[2276.44 - 2282.84] heal become a true expert a true expert
[2280.52 - 2282.84] not a
[2283.36 - 2290.68] biohacker strep is not and never was a
[2286.88 - 2294.20] super bug in the past so strep was never
[2290.68 - 2296.60] a super buug it's not designed to be a
[2294.20 - 2300.00] Super Bug originally it was never meant
[2296.60 - 2303.12] to be one we are forcing it to become a
[2300.00 - 2306.92] super buug
[2303.12 - 2310.16] okay it's much more forgiving strep than
[2306.92 - 2312.64] ever than anything else was okay in its
[2310.16 - 2314.96] original state going back many years ago
[2312.64 - 2317.12] it was much more forgiving it's a
[2314.96 - 2320.88] forgiving
[2317.12 - 2324.12] bacteria it's not as unforgiving as
[2320.88 - 2328.40] merca it's not as unforgiving as Mera so
[2324.12 - 2331.72] that is something to understand cith and
[2328.40 - 2335.56] Mera can be even much more brutal much
[2331.72 - 2339.80] more brutal of a superbug strep still
[2335.56 - 2343.04] even with its worst superbug mentality
[2339.80 - 2347.12] whatever it's more superbug
[2343.04 - 2350.44] creation it doesn't hold the power as
[2347.12 - 2352.92] like Mera and what Mera can turn into
[2350.44 - 2356.24] some kind of flesh eating bacterium that
[2352.92 - 2359.24] just becomes a super super bug so I want
[2356.24 - 2361.48] that clear so people
[2359.24 - 2362.72] know so if they got strap and they're
[2361.48 - 2364.68] living with st they're living with all
[2362.72 - 2366.72] these symptoms you can turn it in it can
[2364.68 - 2368.32] turn naturally into a Super Bug over
[2366.72 - 2371.28] time because it's force-fed the
[2368.32 - 2374.68] antibiotics it's force-fed in the way I
[2371.28 - 2378.44] was saying all those things but it won't
[2374.68 - 2380.28] get to like a Mera level at mca's worst
[2378.44 - 2382.04] so the different varieties of Mera
[2380.28 - 2385.00] there's all these different varities of
[2382.04 - 2387.60] Mera did you know there's thousands of
[2385.00 - 2391.36] varieties of Vera and some of the top
[2387.60 - 2395.48] tier varieties of Vera that are just
[2391.36 - 2397.04] like God awful and they kill people is
[2395.48 - 2399.52] what they do and they give them sepsis
[2397.04 - 2403.08] and they die like the top tier of the
[2399.52 - 2404.92] worst sh's not there so I wanted that to
[2403.08 - 2408.48] be
[2404.92 - 2410.20] clear but strep is no longer one strain
[2408.48 - 2412.48] I want to go back to that a little bit
[2410.20 - 2415.32] it's no longer one
[2412.48 - 2418.08] strain there are so many varieties of
[2415.32 - 2420.68] strep at this point over the
[2418.08 - 2423.24] decades strep being a victim of
[2420.68 - 2425.68] antibiotics it found a way to survive to
[2423.24 - 2427.76] adapt adaptation didn't just mean
[2425.68 - 2430.12] getting stronger it meant mut eating and
[2427.76 - 2432.44] spawning different strains and varieties
[2430.12 - 2435.84] and that's what strep does it's the
[2432.44 - 2439.24] ultimate like spawner of new varieties
[2435.84 - 2442.68] of bacteria all strep all the same
[2439.24 - 2444.48] family but it's the ultimate see here
[2442.68 - 2447.28] with Mariana says over there on IG I
[2444.48 - 2449.76] healed my UTI back in 2002 with the
[2447.28 - 2453.36] herbs and supplements you recommend in
[2449.76 - 2456.88] cleanse the heal book amazing is it
[2453.36 - 2459.84] 2020 let see what it is um healing with
[2456.88 - 2461.96] Victoria I used to be on an antibiotic

[2516.16 - 2521.48] working that's the power of it you no
[2519.00 - 2522.96] biohackers and informationists messing
[2521.48 - 2525.52] around all these different things out
[2522.96 - 2527.28] there on social can do that for people
[2525.52 - 2529.16] this information does and that's why I'm
[2527.28 - 2531.32] a messenger of s so's information
[2529.16 - 2533.76] because it saves lives Maria over there

[2538.92 - 2543.80] incredible let's go into a little bit of
[2540.88 - 2545.40] protocol talk a little bit too and let's
[2543.80 - 2546.12] just double check we covered some stuff
[2545.40 - 2548.12] right
[2546.12 - 2549.96] here let's talk about like the different
[2548.12 - 2551.88] strains a little bit longer the spawning
[2549.96 - 2553.60] the different strains I want to go into
[2551.88 - 2555.36] that over there on YouTube wondering
[2553.60 - 2558.12] wishing good to see you antibiotics used
[2555.36 - 2562.12] to be the go-to for our family after
[2558.12 - 2564.88] medical meeting protocols viy zinc micro
[2562.12 - 2566.64] Ginger turmeric shots cat's claw well I

[2576.12 - 2583.56] medium it's going to get me
[2578.80 - 2586.08] emotional because you know when you heal
[2583.56 - 2588.72] it is everything Maria over there on
[2586.08 - 2590.52] YouTube great topic I used to get UTI oh
[2588.72 - 2595.32] I saw that one already great Chrissy
[2590.52 - 2598.16] over there and I think um twitch Stitch
[2595.32 - 2601.56] Chrissy I was in tears every time I had
[2598.16 - 2604.00] a UTI I can't imagine the amount of
[2601.56 - 2606.68] people that are going through it and
[2604.00 - 2609.92] they go through it on levels that are
[2606.68 - 2614.32] just devastating it's become like the
[2609.92 - 2616.48] Super Bug now level and it's brutal and
[2614.32 - 2618.12] so many people suffer from it their guts
[2616.48 - 2619.88] get ripped to shreds from all the
[2618.12 - 2622.72] antibiotics they have to take they're on
[2619.88 - 2624.56] steroids almost all the time and it's
[2622.72 - 2626.84] brutal along the way strep got
[2624.56 - 2630.68] classified as having a group a and a
[2626.84 - 2633.08] group b yeah the medical world now
[2630.68 - 2634.84] identifies strep all the way through
[2633.08 - 2638.96] Group
[2634.84 - 2641.76] H Group H though as you read about in
[2638.96 - 2644.84] the acne chapter because acne is Strep
[2641.76 - 2647.80] caused by the way you guys it is it's
[2644.84 - 2649.76] medical medium info but it's strep cause
[2647.80 - 2653.08] that the population carries there are
[2649.76 - 2654.92] also strains within the known groups
[2653.08 - 2657.00] that are yet un that are yet
[2654.92 - 2658.96] unidentified and undocumented so here's
[2657.00 - 2661.44] how medicine
[2658.96 - 2665.08] works medical research and science works
[2661.44 - 2668.04] like this they've classified some of the
[2665.08 - 2670.28] bacterium the strains but they haven't
[2668.04 - 2672.24] classified all of them haven't even
[2670.28 - 2674.92] scratched the surface so there's
[2672.24 - 2677.16] bacteria out there that they haven't
[2674.92 - 2678.64] even documented classified got their
[2677.16 - 2681.36] hands on or anything like that and
[2678.64 - 2684.36] that's the scary thing it's even
[2681.36 - 2688.04] scarier yep even a gifted and talented
[2684.36 - 2690.72] lab technician discovered that even if a
[2688.04 - 2692.16] gifted and talented lab technician
[2690.72 - 2693.64] discovered that there were more strains
[2692.16 - 2696.00] and groups of strep that weren't
[2693.64 - 2698.40] currently known the Breakthrough would
[2696.00 - 2700.36] go unrecognized the scientists would not
[2698.40 - 2702.24] be able to find funding for this area of
[2700.36 - 2704.20] critical medical importance because
[2702.24 - 2708.64] right now funding is too tied up in
[2704.20 - 2711.36] misled areas like how genes relate to
[2708.64 - 2714.04] disease so yeah you guys let's go into
[2711.36 - 2715.48] this a little bit now some protocol
[2714.04 - 2718.88] stuff I'm in cleans the heal if you
[2715.48 - 2721.92] don't have the book I feel bad for
[2718.88 - 2725.36] you get the book get the book get the
[2721.92 - 2728.56] book I mean you don't have to spend a
[2725.36 - 2731.40] $5,000 program on how to walk Barefoot
[2728.56 - 2733.96] on your on your lawn you can do that but
[2731.40 - 2736.80] it won't make your UTI go away keep that
[2733.96 - 2739.28] in mind you can do earthing and you can
[2736.80 - 2741.12] do like you can not wear shoes and you
[2739.28 - 2742.80] can watch the sunrise in the morning and
[2741.12 - 2745.80] you can angle your bed a certain way in
[2742.80 - 2747.60] your room the way the sun rises and sun
[2745.80 - 2751.00] sun sets but none of that's going to get
[2747.60 - 2754.20] rid of somebody's de debilitating acne
[2751.00 - 2755.92] sty UTI bladder infections kidney
[2754.20 - 2757.48] infections
[2755.92 - 2759.68] PID
[2757.48 - 2764.24] it's just not going to
[2759.68 - 2765.88] happen hardcore stuff that has to work
[2764.24 - 2768.72] then you can do all that stuff for fun
[2765.88 - 2772.32] the other stuff I was mentioning okay
[2768.72 - 2775.40] danan 144 on IG I was in so much pain
[2772.32 - 2777.32] for nine months with intertial cystis
[2775.40 - 2780.32] celery juice saved my
[2777.32 - 2782.24] life yeah and that's why when someone
[2780.32 - 2783.96] says celery juice sucks or celery juice
[2782.24 - 2786.44] isn't what it is or something out there
[2783.96 - 2790.04] that's it's actually such a disservice
[2786.44 - 2791.88] The Chronic ill it's so sad when celery
[2790.04 - 2795.80] juice literally has turned lives around
[2791.88 - 2797.96] saved lives yeah I know all right let's
[2795.80 - 2801.88] go into it pelvic inflammatory disease
[2797.96 - 2803.72] PID right here talks about UTI it's in

[2811.28 - 2817.08] over 50 groups of
[2813.28 - 2819.32] strep they are different levels of PID
[2817.08 - 2821.36] it's like different levels of
[2819.32 - 2825.92] UTI different levels to all the
[2821.36 - 2825.92] different things different levels to
[2826.40 - 2831.24] sibo incredible okay so let's go into
[2828.76 - 2834.60] the protocol right starts out

[2898.24 - 2904.80] removed all right what's the next thing
[2900.92 - 2907.28] on the list barleygrass juice
[2904.80 - 2912.64] powder another thing on the list
[2907.28 - 2914.68] cat's claw very interesting cat's claw
[2912.64 - 2917.00] critical for
[2914.68 - 2922.04] UTI critical for
[2917.00 - 2925.32] PID critical for men that are having
[2922.04 - 2926.96] prostatitis right there cat's claw it's
[2925.32 - 2928.72] a big one you'll hear more about cats
[2926.96 - 2930.24] claw every day out there and more about
[2928.72 - 2932.28] cats claw every day it's the medical
[2930.24 - 2934.92] medium information that got that out
[2932.28 - 2937.28] there catclaw was around it's been
[2934.92 - 2938.84] around obviously but using for the
[2937.28 - 2941.00] things that it's being used for for
[2938.84 - 2944.24] protocols is medical medium information
[2941.00 - 2946.56] originally for cats claw
[2944.24 - 2950.56] curcumin and there you go that's another
[2946.56 - 2953.64] one de Manos yeah de Manos is
[2950.56 - 2955.92] great but you need more than Dem Manos
[2953.64 - 2957.12] if someone's dealing with UTI and PB and
[2955.92 - 2958.68] some of the things I'm talking about
[2957.12 - 2960.92] here you need more than de Manos de
[2958.68 - 2963.16] Manos is in here it's part of the
[2960.92 - 2964.68] protocol and sometimes you'll hear out
[2963.16 - 2968.12] there like a practitioner or somebody
[2964.68 - 2971.72] will say de Manos use that for your UTI
[2968.12 - 2975.96] it's like okay but what about the golden
[2971.72 - 2979.36] seal what about the cat's claw where's
[2975.96 - 2982.00] that what about the celery juice de
[2979.36 - 2984.60] Manos de Manos drink cranberry juice
[2982.00 - 2987.76] drink cranberry juice that's great and
[2984.60 - 2989.80] all that's great but guess what it's not
[2987.76 - 2992.00] enough for the kind of UTI that are
[2989.80 - 2994.64] happening out there every day right now
[2992.00 - 2996.40] no way it's not enough but it is when
[2994.64 - 2997.36] it's compiled with other things that
[2996.40 - 3001.00] help
[2997.36 - 3003.40] right right and the books have the
[3001.00 - 3005.36] amounts to C but you customize I talk
[3003.40 - 3009.00] about the amounts in here but you
[3005.36 - 3012.80] customized over there on G Elena I had
[3009.00 - 3016.08] several severe PID which went to left

[3019.32 - 3027.48] that with mm now all I need is to heal G
[3025.64 - 3029.44] AOS
[3027.48 - 3032.28] or it says GBS
[3029.44 - 3034.32] ALS all right ibrite it's another one
[3032.28 - 3037.04] right there golden
[3034.32 - 3038.92] seal golden
[3037.04 - 3042.16] seal
[3038.92 - 3044.16] UTI golden
[3042.16 - 3047.44] seal
[3044.16 - 3049.72] UTI golden

[3071.76 - 3076.24] supplements matter so check out medical
[3074.48 - 3077.48] mem information but the quality of the
[3076.24 - 3080.64] supplements
[3077.48 - 3082.80] matter critical I talk about that in the
[3080.64 - 3085.56] supplements chapter in cleanse to heal
[3082.80 - 3087.48] make sure you look at that really
[3085.56 - 3088.60] important
[3087.48 - 3093.92] another
[3088.60 - 3097.28] one strep UTI PID overactive bladder all
[3093.92 - 3102.84] these lemon
[3097.28 - 3105.32] bomb UTI lemon bomb okay ready UTI
[3102.84 - 3105.32] licorice

[3113.76 - 3117.76] Leaf
[3115.32 - 3119.40] incredible and there's more in here too
[3117.76 - 3121.76] that you can play with customize
[3119.40 - 3124.84] yourself it's here the information that
[3121.76 - 3130.24] s so brought to us to save people's
[3124.84 - 3132.40] lives I get it fun you know surfing the
[3130.24 - 3136.80] net surfing
[3132.40 - 3139.72] social whoa let me cold plunge you know
[3136.80 - 3142.24] whoa let me walk Barefoot it's all great
[3139.72 - 3144.04] whatever cold plunging is not good not
[3142.24 - 3147.08] good for people chronically sick all
[3144.04 - 3149.60] that stuff but either way
[3147.08 - 3150.84] I'm talking about fixing problems and
[3149.60 - 3153.00] that's the key and that's what the
[3150.84 - 3155.32] medical medium information does fixes
[3153.00 - 3158.04] problems keep that in mind Amy over
[3155.32 - 3160.28] there on IG friend with
