figure that out I think it's about four

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,829
maybe four years yeah maybe a little bit

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,540

her yeah

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,280
Anthony basically saved my life a number

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,549
of times but specifically one time when

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,960
I had a foodborne illness and then it

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,000
went into appendicitis and I had an

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,140
appendectomy and it was rough recovery

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,130
but I got through it

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,500
thanks Anthony and all of his advice and

51
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,990
reading his book which I think only the

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,450
first one was out then it's a long time

53
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,600
ago yeah yeah I mean it's five years ago

54
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:19,190
I think yeah it'll be six years in March

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,770
when everything changed for me so yeah

56
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,780
it's been great and we do celery juice I

57
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,100
do I'm up to about 20 ounces every

58
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,140
morning me too

59
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,900
okay that's amazing after the lemon

60
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,150
water yeah first we can come in water 16

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,100
to 20 ounces in lemon water and then we

62
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,319
wait about half an hour yeah and then we

63
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,540
do the celery juice and we got a new

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,569
juicer we have a we have a green star

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,120
here in LA and he has the Omega in New

66
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,430
Orleans Meghan yeah and once we went

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,410
from the centrifuge to the masticating

68
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,540
it made a big difference because it just

69
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,250
you do a whole thing of a whole bunch of

70
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,290
celery and you get more than 16 ounces

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,209
so we just kept doing it yeah the mega

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,299
juicer the Omega juicer is my favorite

73
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,610
it's just it's so easy to use it's easy

74
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,290
to think we're always asking me like

75
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,850
what do we do for juicers what do we do

76
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,100
for juicers and and I always tell people

77
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,610
look use the one I use it's a mega

78
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,049
juicer so when om EGA go to go to their

79
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,180
website thank you because people will

80
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,880
buy the wrong juicer and get frustrated

81
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,280
if it's too hard to clean it's too hard

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,799
to clean they give up in that it this is

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,950
like a medical device a juicer is a

84
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,019
medical device it's not it's it isn't

85
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,670
just some kind of like thing or holistic

86
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,620
thing to do or I mean natural thing oh

87
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,350
hey have this have this your salad

88
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,209
spinner you got that you got your mixer

89
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,190
you got your thing know that that's all

90
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,220
great but the juicer is an actual

91
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,590
medical device when you run like

92
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,280
something like this which is an herbal

93
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,590
tonic

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,359
herbal medicine so you're doing herbal

95
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,700
medicine you that's what it is it's

96
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,220
extracting or medicine yeah yes I like

97
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,810
the Omega but but but it's incredible so

98
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,109
you guys are juicing you've been teasing

99
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,209
for a while yeah I was thinking that we

100
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:06,069
know you going back to working with her

101
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:08,989
mom and that's no no no I want to say

102
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,569
six or seven years so I think it's

103
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,030
longer I think longer eight years yeah I

104
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,440
agree

105
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,480
I think it's somewhere about a year's

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,970
and well you know the thing is with you

107
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,350
guys is what I've always noticed is when

108
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,910
you and when you find something that

109
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,220
works you find something that's good you

110
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,310
guys stay with it and you become like I

111
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,320
mean it's basically your do you dedicate

112
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,600
yourself to it I've never heard you guys

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,860
ever say well you know what I'm trying

114
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,520
this now or I'm trying you guys just

115
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,340
tried everything and it didn't work and

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,260
it didn't stick so this is yeah and I

117
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,030
think also were super discipline we're

118
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,910
both you know I was a dancer he's an

119
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,100
athlete so that discipline is already

120
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,050
built in and that does help but also

121
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,510
when when you have tried a lot of other

122
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,030
things and problem still arose and

123
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,860
disease is still were happening then and

124
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,870
this when you when we started doing this

125
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,330
there we didn't have that issue there

126
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,760
was no reoccurrence of illnesses I mean

127
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,560
I I don't know the last time I got sick

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,260
it's been a while no it hasn't and I

129
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,750
think that's relevant is that we've seen

130
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,940
we've seen results not just for

131
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,190
ourselves but for so many people in our

132
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,400
lives that we've either that have come

133
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,260
on to Anthony on their own or we you

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,970
know talked him up and they've joined or

135
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,700
somebody's called and said I've got this

136
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:35,520
problem going on she's like she's read

137
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:37,740
every book every but she's she's like I

138
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,590
haven't read as nearly as much as her

139
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,479
but so many people have used the

140
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,590
protocol and different or you know

141
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,030
relatives of ours

142
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,789
her mom cousins nephews our own children

143
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,220
ourselves and they've had amazing

144
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,020
results so it's not it's not like I

145
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,840
think you change when things aren't

146
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,060
working yeah it's like well okay and

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,390
it's also not something that you can as

148
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,320
we always say we ate a certain way me

149
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,900
for sixty years of my life and then you

150
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,580
cannot expect I mean this is the hardest

151
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,370
thing for people understand you can't

152
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,990
expect to do celery juice for a week and

153
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,150
then everything is everything is there

154
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,390
life is great now when I switched over

155
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,850
to not eating

156
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,640
anymore I would say it was at least a

157
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:30,280
two-year process of kind of getting

158
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:33,160
through just not quite feeling right and

159
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,990
not and I haven't the idea of going back

160
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,790
to me isn't doesn't easily I mean that

161
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,220
exists for me at this point in time but

162
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,470
it took time and the celery juice and

163
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,940
and then the the smoothies and all the

164
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:47,200
other protocols that we follow

165
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:51,600
throughout the day they all they take

166
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,400
they take time to settle in and but yes

167
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,680
it's worth it yeah I mean I think that

168
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,440
some people get results right away I I

169
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,480
see on Anthony's Instagram which is so

170
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,860

171
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,340

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,730
I'll be affronted with doubt and a lot

178
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,990
of questions and well you know how do

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,610

say here's the book read the book and

181
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,450
they want me to do their research and

182
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,950
and and try to defend what they're

183
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,480
saying and it's like you all the

184
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,340
information is there you can read it if

185
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,380
you want to so then when I go on

186
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,170
Instagram and I see the positivity and

187
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,120
so many stories of healing and

188
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,490
especially the pictures which you can't

189
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,040
argue that I mean I tell people that are

190
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,200
doubting I like go to Instagram and see

191
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,000
the results you cannot argue with those

192
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,590
pictures ya know it happens that's what

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,210
that's what you know journalists and

194
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,830
media they don't go to that and they

195
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,270
don't look at that and then they all of

196
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,250
a sudden say oh celery juice doesn't

197
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,290
work yeah I can't tell you how many are

198
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,820
they do it for a week just doesn't work

199
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,350
really yeah I can't say how many

200
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,970
articles I talk about the people with

201
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,890
chronic illness they're suffering their

202
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,840
skin problems everything they cut all

203
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,520
that out yeah and they don't look into

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,110
that sometimes you know when it's at

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,310
because when you look at that's what's

206
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,610
powerful about Instagram because

207
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,500
Instagram tells the real story the real

208
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,820
story and you guys are fighting for it

209
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,560
out there you're cleaning up everything

210
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,030
you're healing you're working on it

211
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,700
you're staying strong on it you know

212
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,160
with Scott and Chelsea exactly they're

213
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,320
they know you can't drink celery juice

214
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,479
for just one week and so many people

215
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,400
they hear about it out there and they

216
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,550
don't look into the stories and they

217
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,539
don't look into the powerful healing

218
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,910
information that's happened and they

219
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,070
don't read the books and they'll just do

220
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,050
summary for five days and they'll say

221
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,880
hey this is my story of doing celery

222
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,710
juice for five to seven days really

223
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,600
doesn't work really doesn't air you

224
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,680
think you guys know you guys know just

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,780
like so many people in the medical

226
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,180
medium community once you do that celery

227
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,970
juice and you really stay within each

228
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,310
month at a time how it's a lifesaver and

229
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:14,430
organized I've seen it out of the

230
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:14,430
picture walking from over there okay

231
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,630
seen so many people healed so many

232
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,520
things from it when they stay with the

233
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,860
long term and you guys you guys know

234
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,110
that you guys read the books you were

235
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,420
you doing even if Scott says well I

236
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,370
haven't read as much but look that what

237
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,620
happens is you guys really do read more

238
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,210
than I've seen a lot of people do out

239
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,820
there because people don't get the book

240
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,810
and they'll rush to the recipes or

241
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,560
they'll go right to the chat

242
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,840
specifically their data that books tell

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,790
a story all through it where they have

244
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,270
to read the books all the way through

245
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,160
and it's about understanding the big

246
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,470
picture because I I've had friends call

247
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,140
and say I have a this specific issue

248
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,850
whatever whatever it was and there's

249
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,490
nothing in the book about it and I'm

250
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,500
thinking to myself yeah there is but you

251
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,900
have to read the whole book because it's

252
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,480
it's the overview and the understanding

253
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,580
of the whole picture of what happens for

254
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,010
you to understand oh this little thing

255
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,840
that I'm dealing with pretty much I can

256
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,070
understand this is what I need to do

257
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,090
because it's going to help the whole

258
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,860
body function better so I encourage

259
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,620
everybody to read it and some of it is

260
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,750
like for me I reread all the time I have

261
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,950
two or three books by my bedside out if

262
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,360
I wake up in the middle of the night and

263
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,530
I can't go back to sleep I start reading

264
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
and then I'm the next day and I'm like

265
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,870
oh no it's six o'clock in the morning I

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,820
gotta go

267
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,350
Anthony we go to the grocery store

268
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:45,170
there's no celery in the grocery store

269
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:48,140
like dang those don'ts anywhere dolls

270
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,339
you know it's funny the sour notes play

271
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,410
now they're going to eat what I care

272
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:52,640
people say well you know I'm gonna stop

273
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,230
drinking celery juice or I'm not gonna

274
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,529
show you my good actually that's good

275
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,850
that's good in fact you know when you

276
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,500
see when you see something out in the

277
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,240
world of like science and research

278
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,890
hasn't discovered celery juice you know

279
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,510
being anything good for people even

280
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,880
though millions are healing globally

281
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,800
right so am I good keep on doing that

282
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,260
because I can't find it anymore

283
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,570
and I needed to calm down I got people

284
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,700
to stop drinking it a little bit if you

285
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,930
look you know I'm gonna get selfish for

286
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,089
a second and say well everybody stop

287
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,000
drinking it I'll always be there for me

288
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,710
i buy lots and lots of cases and make

289
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,270
sure my friends have lots of cases but

290
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,750
you know that I'm owning I want you guys

291
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,120
to have last year we were in Colorado

292
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,510
and in the mountains and we were trying

293
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,550
to get

294
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:39,890
celery organic celery juice celery and

295
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,950
in the middle of winter time and the

296
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,480
person at the store said it's weird you

297
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,400
know so people are coming in and they're

298
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,959
buying celery and and some people are

299
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,980
coming in they're just buying cases of

300
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:57,830
celery and like hey but now we're

301
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:59,510
screwed we can't get it will do cucumber

302
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,370
juice yeah which is power double up on

303
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,020
our lemon water and there's always

304
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,360
there's always substitutes and that's

305
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,339
usually not for very long when the store

306
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,620
is out we have a couple secret stores we

307
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,750
go to the camera so it helps to have the

308
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,150
lemon waters a backup because it's its

309
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,700
flushes out the liver washes out the

310
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:21,050
kidneys if that's what it does you know

311
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:23,120
and so that's really important concept

312
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,279
that's in the in the liver rescue book

313
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,320
you have that whole idea of the liver

314
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,610
waking up in the middle of the night and

315
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,890
trying to let it just work quietly by

316
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,200
itself until noon or whatever without

317
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,750
having introducing anything that's going

318
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,700
to you know fats or any any breakfast

319
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,150
stuff that's going to make it take it

320
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,890
out of its kind of like cleansing it is

321
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,959
is fascinating to me it's something I

322
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,890
never knew but it kind of makes so much

323
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,900
sense and when you

324
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,290
acknowledge how important the liver is

325
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,960
and how much liver related illnesses

326
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,670
there are out there is everything it

327
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,470
feels like it does it jam feels like

328
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,710
it's everything although I know I have

329
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,620
to under I'm diverting what am i doing

330
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,480
yes I'm diverting for a moment but of

331
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,670
late I've been keep bumping into people

332
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,650
that are having brain stuff yeah going

333
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,840
on and I'm like okay when's Anthony's

334
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:19,130
I'm sorry no no I know I'm just worried

335
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,880
about you but you shouldn't be here you

336
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:27,140
should be working on last night writing

337
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,020
trying to finish up this book I'm

338
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:38,960
working on now exactly and and now

339
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:40,430
you're so quiet in your life well you

340
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,560
know the thing is with the brain the

341
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,840
brain gets clogged up when the livers

342
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,690
clogged up so that's what goes wrong

343
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,370
when the livers all like all congested

344
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,990
stagnant sluggish it's got all the

345
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,390
poisons petrochemicals in there

346
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,290
no one pump their own gas years ago you

347
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,330
guys know that right

348
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,250
no one pump their own gas there's 60

349
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,320
year old daughters six year old sons are

350
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,570
now pumping gas they're breathing it in

351
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,610
like it was nothing it didn't exist in

352
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,960
the past we have all that Patrick

353
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,060
chemical going on in people's brains

354
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,530
like never before the livers getting

355
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,840
filled of toxic heavy metals mercury

356
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,360
cadmium lead arsenic all of it

357
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,580
mercury especially luminol right and all

358
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,050
of this and then it gets overloaded and

359
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,790
then pathogens people got the

360
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,620
epstein-barr out there they got all the

361
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,230
cytomegalovirus they got all that kind

362
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,420
of stuff and with all of that adding up

363
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,860
inside the liver it just it goes to the

364
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,350
brain after the liver just kind of

365
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,690
coughs it out like Oh overflow and boom

366
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,140
it all comes out anymore yeah anxiety

367
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:38,450
stars yep depression all of it that's

368
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,680
why the liver so incredibly important

369
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,090
that's why I had to do that big old

370
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,740
liver rescue but but the brain had

371
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,730
orange juice so that brain book is gonna

372
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,920
come on its way to working on the liver

373
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,390
and cleaning it well well he's writing

374
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,860
the book about the brain and we just

375
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,850
need to keep working on the plan of

376
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,699
cleansing the liver

377
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,110
it's a big job yeah no it is it's always

378
00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,410
got to be there it's like you have to

379
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,079

380
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,509
thing is though is is with you guys is

381
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,389
what I've always noticed is that you

382
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,970
know you you learn the information and

383
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,649
then when you're telling other people or

384
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,259
you're telling me you tell me the

385
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:17,120
information no you know what I mean and

386
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,579
I like that no I get on the phone with

387
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,079
you it's just a nosy you're just like

388
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:22,579
you're just you're just like you know

389
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,110
what the thing is with this and this and

390
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,180
this is what you needed your your

391
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,709
digestive system your hydrochloric acid

392
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,930
and I'm doing the celery juice because

393
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:32,089
of this and and like you guys like

394
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,440
really learn it and I know I know

395
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,690
there's a lot of medical medium

396
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,130
followers and they read the books and

397
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,110
stuff and they know what to and they're

398
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,329
sewing on it yeah right but you know

399
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,949
it's it's also a lot of people where you

400
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,990
you know it's like no that's your

401
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:47,509
hydrochloric acid don't sorry just

402
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,100
builds it up it written it and it takes

403
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,100
time to get them to kind of learn about

404
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,540
but what happens is they get diverted

405
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,420
out there because the Internet's filled

406
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,889
with all this other information that

407
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,019
doesn't work yeah that is filled with

408
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,209
all these other theories and concepts

409
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:04,339
and then it gets all mixed up in

410
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:06,050
Kabbalah then joggled out there so now

411
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,779
awesome something somebody's putting

412
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,660
lemon in their celery yeah the stores

413
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,670
are lined now with like with lemon in

414
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,350
celery juice while it's HPP high

415
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,569
pressure pasteurization that means it

416
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,980
was pasteurized so you think it's fresh

417
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:20,899
it's got lemon in there it's not gonna

418
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,610
help you then someone says I drank what

419
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,149
I trans celery juice for 30 days and it

420
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,089
didn't help

421
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,980
and so it's so it really pays off to

422
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,540
actually know the information to get

423
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,339
help others so you can actually change

424
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,649
the planet change the world and the

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,199
that online a bubble now I'm just so

428
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,189
weird kind of bubble and I don't know

429
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,959
what the hell's going on you can just

430
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,939
look around and go what we're doing

431
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,220
something wrong so we've done something

432
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,899
wrong for many many many years you can

433
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,310
look at our society even look at the

434
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,839
amount of disease that's out there you

435
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,370
know when you want to know something

436
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,110
about a culture and a society you look

437
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,639
at what's at the intersections when I

438
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,730
was in the South shooting some films

439
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,470
like 20 years ago every intersection had

440
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,130
churches literally there before churches

441
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,020
on an inner

442
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,569
in the Bible Belt and you look at our

443
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,120
intersections now they're either

444
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,059
restaurants or drug stores or banks

445
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,380
that's it that we have created a Sikh

446
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:20,419
culture a sikh society and you know not

447
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,380
specifically anyone's fault a lot of

448
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,600
good people out there trying to help

449
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:28,130
like like you say all the time but

450
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,410
misguided for sure and you know for me

451
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,350
and for our family or most of our family

452
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,020
this is you know been incredibly healing

453
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,090
and I know I'll never I'll never eat

454
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,520
animal products again I know I'll never

455
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,110
know that work for you guys I got a lot

456
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,700
of people that are living that are doing

457
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,350
the animal products but they're keeping

458
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,059
away from the right ones I always tell

459
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,030
them to stay away from the bacon keep

460
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,100
the big we're in the eggs the cheese the

461
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,480
milk stay away from those and yeah if

462
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,799
you want some other animal products that

463
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,419
works for you make sure you're doing all

464
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,010
the other medical medium information

465
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,450
well for you guys what works for you is

466
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,030
the plant-based and I always say the

467
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,059
plant place is great absolutely the yeah

468
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,429
definitely I mean for a medium if we try

469
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,200
to get in by the time we wake up and you

470
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,120
have lemon water and then we have our

471
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,039
celery and then usually either it

472
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,799
depends if I'm going to like if I have

473
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,159
work or something or a class I'll do an

474
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,840
apple on the way or I'll take my

475
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,770
heavy-metal detox smoothie in a in a

476
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,110
thermos or my one of the liver liver

477
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,820
rescue smoothie so I'll do one of those

478
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,159
so I do one of those smoothies every

479
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,720
single day and then by the time that and

480
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,539
then I'll usually have a second Apple I

481
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,100
mean it's like after lunch you know it's

482
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,830
almost dinner time and then a couple of

483
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,990
snacks and there isn't time really to

484
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,140
have a turkey sandwich or something

485
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,179
there's I'm trying to fill my day and my

486
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,799
diet with so much and a lot of we're

487
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:49,940
leaning more and more into raw so we're

488
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,289
trying to get as many fruits and

489
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,600
vegetables in and by the time you

490
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,820
actually do that for me there isn't time

491
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,220
or room in my stomach to put something

492
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,320
else in whoa so an apple is medicine

493
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,520
that's a thing in people people don't

494
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,409
know that out there they're afraid of

495
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,610
fruit it got the fruit fear because of

496
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,440
all the misinformation out there

497
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,169
floating around that's something that's

498
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,650
really hurting people bad so Apple

499
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:13,780
that's Madison right an egg is

500
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,790
medicine there's nothing medicinal in an

501
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,740
egg instead the egg will feed every

502
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,540
pathogen people haven't they have acne

503
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,550
that means they have streptococcus in

504
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,750
their system if they have eczema that

505
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,970
means they have that scene bar in their

506
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,980
liver with copper so it's like and if

507
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,810
you get if you eat the eggs you're gonna

508
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,580
feed those pathogens and you're gonna

509
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,320
get sicker but you know what's sad is

510
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,120
there's a lot of people out there

511
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,860
whether it's you know dietitians and I

512
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,180
love dieticians and I love nutritionists

513
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,950
and I love doctors you guys know that I

514
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,870
mean that's all right all I'm about I've

515
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,700
worked with doctors my whole life but

516
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,560
there's a lot of different people in the

517
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,900
field though don't know any of the good

518
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,210
stuff and they tell all women just eggs

519
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,530
eggs do eggs and protein and eggs and

520
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,240
eggs and they tell them eggs just get

521
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,040
sicker down the road and you know what

522
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,960
it's all fun and games until you're

523
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,730
suffering until you got like really bad

524
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,350
fibroids and you're really suffering

525
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,940
until you got PCOS and so you got

526
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,190
endometriosis and it's out of control

527
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,990
and your whole life becomes doctor

528
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,940
visits yeah because you're getting

529
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,470
information out there about how oh it's

530
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,600
protein you should be eating egg oh you

531
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,460
should be eating this or that and and

532
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,500
you know what gets people in trouble so

533
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,610
and what happens is when you say you're

534
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,900
gonna be doing the apples and you're

535
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,670
doing the different snacks you do all

536
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,800
that that's medicine you're talking

537
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,020
about that's what that is and we need

538
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,120
that because the world has changed it's

539
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,000
really polluted like never before

540
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,820
yeah and and we were the ones actually

541
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,230
just absorb any now plants absorb you

542
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,600
know how plants are if they keep the air

543
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,140
healthier right yeah thing right that

544
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,850
that whole thing well we keep also the

545
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,830
planet healthier because we're sucking

546
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,140
up all that garbage that's floating in

547
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,210
the air we're taking in all that plastic

548
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,700
and petrochemicals we're taking in all

549
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,010
everything else we're like the sponges

550
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,020
now our livers like the sponges and

551
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,000
we're keeping the planet cleaner in a

552
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,130
way by becoming the ones that are filled

553
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,110
with all the garbage and just like the

554
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,870
plants are and people don't realize this

555
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,160
so hey we're you know guys and we're the

556
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,710
most vulnerable we're not walking around

557
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,360
with armor and fur and that other

558
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,700
animals have where where our skin it

559
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,470
absorbs things and we're breathing in

560
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,410
stuff every day so exactly I think the

561
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,620
hardest thing for most people that I

562
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,770
talk to about all this is just finding

563
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,500
the time and also accepting a certain

564
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,960
amount of respond

565
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,210
ability for your health because we live

566
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,280
in this tough in this era and I was

567
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,050
thinking about this last night it's hard

568
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,180
I know people say we don't have time we

569
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,260
don't have time to get up in juice we

570
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,090
don't have time we've got two little

571
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,830
kids we don't we don't have time to do

572
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,720
that we can't afford a juicer all those

573
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:46,550
kinds of things and it's easier to have

574
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,560
somebody to go to the doctor one time

575
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,580
and get the pill and say this is what's

576
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,880
wrong with your stomach

577
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,190
take this pill it seems easier but in

578
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,650
the long run all the pills go to your

579
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,080
liver and they're not you're not solving

580
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,210
a problem you're you're putting a lid on

581
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,860
it you're covering it up and it's it's

582
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,100
in Fester's and that's what I think

583
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,420
we're seeing in in the pandemic of

584
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,630
health issues that are going on around

585
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,550
us now chronic illnesses and and mystery

586
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,840
illnesses which was kind of one of the

587
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,640
big things that I hooked into in the

588
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,830
beginning when Anton I first met Anthony

589
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,540
was talking to he's like yeah what are

590
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,720
people doing for that I always go back

591
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,600
to oh there is no cure for the common

592
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,540
cold but there we spend billions of

593
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,840
dollars on this planet with on products

594
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,640
that are on a shelf every month or two

595
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,170
months in the wintertime for all of our

596
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,820
kids and all ourselves in the cough

597
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,280
medicine all these things and in the end

598
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,290
they're just kind of getting you through

599
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,900
something masking and making it last

600
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:47,780
longer but there is no cure but we have

601
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,730
all this products that don't fix it they

602
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,680
don't they don't prevent it they just

603
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,630
kind of hear it makes you feel better

604
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,760
because you think you're taking

605
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,470
something to help you and instead of

606
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,990
saying what is there something I can

607
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,000
take before I get sick that I can do and

608
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,770
make it habit and carve out that get up

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,170
an extra half an hour earlier a day or

610
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,490
in my case I get up an hour and ten

611
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,590
minutes before I have to leave to go to

612
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,900
work to make all the food and drinks

613
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,510
that I need to take to go with me in the

614
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,890
corner but it's become part of my like

615
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,770
therapy it's almost like a meditation

616
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,500
and it's and I say it's something that

617
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm doing for myself and then a trend

618
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,490
you know then I pass that on to my

619
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,930
family and to other friends so I'm

620
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,460
getting I'm sharing something and the

621
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,970
beauty of Anthony is that he's sharing

622
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,320
this with everybody and you know he

623
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,980
always says you can go to a library and

624
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,300
pick up his books if you need to

625
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,250
and if you can't get him in your local

626
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,320
library send us a letter we'll send the

627
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,580
book here we'll buy the books I'm send

628
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,110
them to your library I don't care where

629
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,600
you are we'll get you all the books and

630
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,610
put them in your library and then you're

631
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,500
you're taking there's something healing

632
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,160
and just saying I'm doing this for

633
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,940
myself

634
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,830
and taking this time for my own health

635
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,200
and well-being every day and it

636
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,570
translates through your whole body not

637
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,820
just whatever you whatever your ailment

638
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:06,690
specific ailment is and it becomes a

639
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:12,540
life kind of a life a habit and it's and

640
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:19,140
it's life fulfilling and and anyway it's

641
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:25,620
I rambled a little bit but well I never

642
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:27,990
stop talking about how people are sick

643
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,250
of us talking about family and they're

644
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,800
just like oh here we go again

645
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,120
sorry um what I was gonna say is one of

646
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,090
the simple things that I like to say

647
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,180
never fear if you think about our all of

648
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,520
our bodies as a machine okay or like a

649
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,350
car right you would never take a car if

650
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,880
you had a gas part electric car you

651
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,210
would never take a card of gas station

652
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,660
and you choose choose the gas you can

653
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:54,750
choose gas or you could choose part gas

654
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:58,410
parts and or all stand you wouldn't pick

655
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:01,560
the sand pump to put in your car or the

656
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,970
part gas parts and pump because your car

657
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,680
wouldn't function I don't know how far

658
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,750
you would get on sand and gas but

659
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,160
probably not very far you're gonna pick

660
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,630
the gaps right to put in your car

661
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,210
because that's how your car is gonna

662
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,730
function not its optimum well our bodies

663
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,500
are the same you can we can be eating

664
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,630
you know a lot of the common stuff

665
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,100
that's out there eating and your your

666
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,050
machine is going to break down at some

667
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,780
point and it may not be now but it will

668
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,820
be later and you know little things

669
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,160
start to creep up as you get a little

670
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,440
bit older and or you can put stuff in

671
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,690
your body that can actually use 100

672
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
percent of which is the celery juice and

673
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,400
that's why it was soupy I always tell

674
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,960
everybody that no one's immune to

675
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,950
getting a symptom there's a lot of

676
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,540
people who think they're indestructible

677
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,760
now they're young they're working out

678
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,860
there doing their thing but they will

679
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,779
end up with symptoms because everybody

680
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,669
is

681
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,109
that's the problem right now yeah and

682
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:52,519
you know when you said Scott you said

683
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:54,109
mystery illness that's how can you like

684
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,789
locked on to send the medical medium

685
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:57,919
information begin with the first book I

686
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,479
talked about you know that's when she a

687
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,639
spirit of compassion coined the whole

688
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:03,919
mystery chronic illness thing yeah and I

689
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,779
say that because nobody knew did all

690
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,700
these illnesses like eczema psoriasis is

691
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:11,779
a mystery they didn't know they thought

692
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,469
because it had a name the research you

693
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,080
know what it was about

694
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:16,820
yeah multiple sclerosis yeah I wrote my

695
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,979
ology they're all mysteries right so

696
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,080
it's not just this random case of

697
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:23,089
mystery illness where someone gets sick

698
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,820
somewhere in some part of the country

699
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:28,279
and doctors are good you know perplexed

700
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,469
every single condition that has a

701
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,419
symptom that has a symptom or a

702
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:34,309
condition that's mean that you know

703
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,929
anything that has a label as a mystery

704
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:37,549
to research in science the medical

705
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,559
science of research now all of it

706
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:40,940
autoimmune complete mystery to research

707
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,779
in science they don't know that's why

708
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,279
they're telling everybody they're

709
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:46,099
blaming it on them now they're saying

710
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,169
it's your body being faulty your bad

711
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:50,629
genes okay we all got bad genes just in

712
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,129
the last 20 years that's centuries and

713
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:54,739
centuries centuries our big genes just

714
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:56,419
went complete just dinner down the tubes

715
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,729
in just the last 100 years and you know

716
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,440
so every so the young people that you

40s and 50s whatever and they all know

719
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:07,489

735
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:36,589
what people look at me sometimes when I

say that I mean some they go glassy-eyed

737
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:40,999
all right they don't see I really I

738
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,679
don't know about that because I'm eating

744
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:54,019
over that they're like he does he's out

745
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,729
of touch but I'm not out of touch

746
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:58,070
because you'll remember this you'll

747
00:27:55,729 --> 00:28:00,139
remember that no everybody's getting

748
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,640
something on whether it's UTIs that

749
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,890
become

750
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,330
whether it's ringing the ears whether

751
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,830
it's tingles numbness whether it's

752
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,590

plantar fasciitis on the feet whatever

755
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,620
it is you know you can just keep on

756
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,240
going and a diagnosis and everything

757
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,160
else about it everybody is coming down

758
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,170
with something yeah and that's why this

759
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,730
information so critical but you got you

760
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,410
guys see it out there you see people

761
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,180
getting sick you see it all over the

762
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,520
place it's heartbreaking it really is

763
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,830
it's heartbreaking and I feel like we

764
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,470
have this little gem of information

765
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,850
medical medium and I want to share it

766
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,470
with everybody and I want everybody to

767
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,300
at least try it and I know it's hard and

768
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,370
one thing I want to say about Scott is

769
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,560
you know he works really long hours I

770
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,560
mean like nobody like me seriously yeah

771
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,420
and you know I'm sure people are

772
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,650
thinking oh but he's an actor and he's

773
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,970
probably got all these people doing this

774
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,740
stuff for him he does have an assistant

775
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,420
that will sometimes go to the grocery

776
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,070
store for him but I think you prefer to

777
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,670
pick out your own stuff usually he does

778
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,920
everything but he does give up even

779
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,960
after a 16-hour day he'll he will go to

780
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,430
the gym and then he comes back and in

781
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,590
the morning he gets up an hour to an

782
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,170
hour and a half early to prepare all of

783
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,360
this because he because he then can do a

784
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,490
16-hour day and go to the gym literally

785
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,380
that the reason he's able to really do

786
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,080
that is yes he's got discipline but

787
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,180
mostly because of the celery and the

788
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,190
heavy-metal detox smoothie and the food

789
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,170
that he eats during the day and not very

790
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,240
much fat and all the stuff that he's

791
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:31,540
doing to keep his machine running yeah

792
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,400
and look it's not I by I'm not perfect

793
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,770
and I sometimes eat things that I wish I

794
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,560
hadn't eaten and I sometimes don't have

795
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,960
time to prepare the things that I wished

796
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:45,250
I had time to prepare for but I can tell

797
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:51,880
you this that I can my energy through my

798
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:55,630
days has changed also a year ago was it

799
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:59,710
a year two years ago no that I stopped

800
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:01,900
drinking coffee and I think I know ring

801
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,660
is closer and so because I think it's

802
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,410
two years in March and so my my energy

803
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:10,600

on over 16 hours on three and a half

805
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,030
hours sleep

806
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,290
night before because I flew in I didn't

807
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,720
have time and I gotta get up at 4:00 in

808
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,610
the morning but I'll go 16 hours and I

809
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:26,200
will go to the gym afterwards can do and

810
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:29,200
I am using but I'm by using and eating

811
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,780
this way I have solid consistent energy

812
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,380
throughout the day and I'm not a young

813
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,570
person anymore but I think most of the

814
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,660
young people's ass on earth all day long

815
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,550
because I'm I'm just eating better than

816
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,750
they are and I'm putting better fuel in

817
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,370
my body and and I and I also had carry

818
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,680
that positive attitude through the day

819
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,960
with me and that comes from just feeling

820
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,970
what I what I'm using and what I what my

821
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,050
energy level is coming from it's all

822
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:02,290
good and positive so I feel you know I

823
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,750
just I'm incredibly grateful that we've

824
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,760
had this big change really huge change

825
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,640
in our life and it's and it's like it

826
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,890
literally is life saving life extending

827
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,960
and more importantly quality of life

828
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,730
when you're looking at you know it's

829
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,680
easy when you're 18 it's like don't

830
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,930
worry about it so our 18 year old

831
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,630
friends and members of our family that

832
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,940
are young they whether they choose to

833
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,400
use this protocol now they've been

834
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,070
exposed to it they understand it when

835
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,420
they use it they see in me they do see

836
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,180
immediate results because when you're

837
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,830
young your body is is cleaner and for

838
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,540
the most part you hope and can process

839
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,660
things quicker and get to the truth of

840
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:44,820
stuff faster but one of one of my

841
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:48,700
relatives who was diagnosed with

842
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,320
borderline celiac he and he's in college

843
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,870
so what do you want to do in college you

844
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,090
want to drink beer and eat pizza beer

845
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:59,290
out of aluminum cans all of those things

846
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,840
and he was in trouble and his stomach

847
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,750
was giving him a lot of trouble and he

848
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,180
switched he made a switch to sell reduce

849
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,980
he committed to doing that in college

850
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,960
which is horrible Anthony always calls

851
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,830
him his hero which makes him feel really

852
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,240
good and and he had he's amazing stuff

853
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,600
he's slowly changed but he would

854
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,160
have amazing immediate results and then

855
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,360
periodically as a young person he'd go

856
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,740
out and have the feet set with the guys

857
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,690
and and he couldn't always get

858
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,000
gluten-free pizza and you know and he

859
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,370
couldn't always find a wheat free beer

860
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,040
and those kinds of things and so he

861
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,050
would slip and then immediately if his

862
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,580
stomach would go again so he knows he

863
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,220
has the information that's my point

864
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,890
he has the information and he knows if

865
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,360
he wants to take care of himself or he

866
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,280
wants to make it change he has all the

867
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,160
information it's in the book he calls

868
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,900
her all the time we talked about it and

869
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,809
so that's the good news

870
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,520
the information is there it's it's it's

871
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,830
out there and millions of people are

872
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,440
picking it up and and we feel we feel

873
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,230
tremendously grateful for that and we

874
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,340
want more people to do it because

875
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,290
there's no reason that we can't take

876
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,910
charge of our own health that's that's

877
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,640
the other thing that's the that's the

878
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:12,130
blessing within books is it really that

879
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,080
all the information is in the books you

880
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,400
know so you you I know everybody would

881
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,530
love to be able to sit here with Anthony

882
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,470
