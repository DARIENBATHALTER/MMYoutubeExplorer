[1.04 - 4.32] we're live right now
[2.56 - 6.40] live and once again we're doing a sneak
[4.32 - 8.32] peek into these books right here when
[6.40 - 10.40] you guys get these books your mind is
[8.32 - 11.92] going to be blown
[10.40 - 14.48] mark my words
[11.92 - 15.44] it's going to be blown i'll tell you why
[14.48 - 17.36] because
[15.44 - 21.52] i've been going into these books and
[17.36 - 23.92] re-reading and i just can't believe what
[21.52 - 25.68] was put into these books i'm gonna talk
[23.92 - 26.88] about neurological stuff and a lot of
[25.68 - 28.80] different symptoms i'm gonna give you a
[26.88 - 31.20] sneak peek into these books but
[28.80 - 33.28] seriously guys and they're 40 off right
[31.20 - 35.12] now which is insane insane they're
[33.28 - 37.20] hundred dollar books and they're listed
[35.12 - 39.20] now for 29.26
[37.20 - 41.04] if you ordered the book at a higher
[39.20 - 42.48] price it's changed now because when they
[41.04 - 43.84] do ship the book out you're gonna get
[42.48 - 45.44] the lowest price so it doesn't even
[43.84 - 47.84] matter and you won't be charged on your
[45.44 - 49.04] card until the book is shipped
[47.84 - 50.80] right
[49.04 - 53.44] so you know you don't have to worry
[50.80 - 55.76] there uma kelly yep surprise live so i
[53.44 - 57.52] just want to tell you guys like when you
[55.76 - 58.80] have these books in your hands you're
[57.52 - 60.72] you're not going to see anything out
[58.80 - 63.52] there in the world like this it doesn't
[60.72 - 65.36] exist and i said earlier that before the
[63.52 - 66.56] medical medium books there was just eat
[65.36 - 68.00] better books
[66.56 - 68.96] it was just eat better books that's all
[68.00 - 71.76] it was
[68.96 - 73.44] that's all there was and then if you had
[71.76 - 74.56] a symptom like
[73.44 - 77.92] your
[74.56 - 80.48] jaw felt crooked your gums hurt your
[77.92 - 83.44] tongue burned your eyes
[80.48 - 85.28] flickered your you you had you know
[83.44 - 87.44] floaters in the eyes you had tingles and
[85.28 - 89.92] numbness you had fatigue your legs felt
[87.44 - 91.76] like sandbags there wasn't a single book
[89.92 - 93.36] or anything in existence before the
[91.76 - 95.76] medical medium books
[93.36 - 98.00] if you had bell's palsy
[95.76 - 99.20] and bad sciatica there wasn't a book out
[98.00 - 101.76] there if you had hashimoto's
[99.20 - 103.60] fibromyalgia if you had als if you had
[101.76 - 105.76] ms you had anything
[103.60 - 107.44] there wasn't a book out there for any of
[105.76 - 109.52] these symptoms neurological symptoms and
[107.44 - 111.84] everything medical medium books they
[109.52 - 113.76] broke the mold right so people for the
[111.84 - 115.12] first time ever found out what was wrong
[113.76 - 116.48] with them but
[115.12 - 118.40] but get this
[116.48 - 120.40] and you guys already know the history
[118.40 - 122.48] with cleanse the heel
[120.40 - 125.44] how insane this book is and how many
[122.48 - 128.16] people are healing around the world when
[125.44 - 129.68] you guys get a hold of these books i
[128.16 - 131.44] just saw thyroid healing back there too
[129.68 - 134.00] when i moved the book when you guys get
[131.44 - 136.16] a hold of these books you i you won't
[134.00 - 137.68] believe your eyes
[136.16 - 139.68] it's going to be a mind-blowing
[137.68 - 143.84] experience
[139.68 - 146.56] every other sentence and it really is
[143.84 - 147.68] this is different i mean this is another
[146.56 - 150.16] level
[147.68 - 152.24] of medical medium information that's
[150.16 - 154.16] going to change how health is out there
[152.24 - 156.00] just like the other books have you know
[154.16 - 158.00] like neurological lyme they now test
[156.00 - 159.76] repsting var with lyme why are they
[158.00 - 161.84] testing for epstein barks medical medium
[159.76 - 164.16] said i've seen bars behind lyme disease
[161.84 - 166.72] and now all the lyme doctors are kind of
[164.16 - 168.16] not caring about the bacteria myth in
[166.72 - 170.40] theory anymore they're actually all
[168.16 - 172.56] looking for epstein-barr it's incredible
[170.40 - 174.40] what the medical union books have done
[172.56 - 175.20] reserving a book is critical and i know
[174.40 - 178.08] look
[175.20 - 179.60] i get it i'm doing it live right now
[178.08 - 181.20] this is my third live talking about the
[179.60 - 183.04] brain saver books
[181.20 - 185.68] blah blah blah
[183.04 - 187.36] but you got to reserve a book
[185.68 - 190.32] because
[187.36 - 192.00] when when the books are released they'll
[190.32 - 193.52] sell out real quick that's what happens
[192.00 - 195.36] with the medical media books and then if
[193.52 - 197.44] you're sick or you have a symptom or you
[195.36 - 198.96] really need it for a friend or you need
[197.44 - 201.60] it for a neighbor or a family member or
[198.96 - 204.64] a loved one you gotta wait and you gotta
[201.60 - 206.24] wait a long time possibly so reserving a
[204.64 - 207.60] book is critical you're not gonna get
[206.24 - 208.48] charged for it
[207.60 - 210.64] and
[208.48 - 212.16] it's so inexpensive
[210.64 - 213.68] and i have people tell me every day a
[212.16 - 215.60] friend of mine said
[213.68 - 217.68] i had a i had a friend over right a
[215.60 - 219.68] practitioner friend over to hang out for
[217.68 - 221.36] a little bit known for years and he
[219.68 - 222.72] grabbed on to these and he said this is
[221.36 - 224.88] incredible
[222.72 - 226.40] he goes but why are you doing this i'm
[224.88 - 229.92] like what are you talking about why
[226.40 - 231.84] don't you chop these up
[229.92 - 234.72] into like
[231.84 - 236.32] like books like smaller books or why
[234.72 - 238.48] don't you and he's sitting here trying
[236.32 - 239.52] to figure out how i can make money
[238.48 - 241.44] he says
[239.52 - 243.20] why don't you make programs out of these
[241.44 - 244.96] books and just
[243.20 - 246.56] and just literally everybody has to do
[244.96 - 248.48] this they have to pay for the program or
[246.56 - 251.04] whatever i go no
[248.48 - 254.72] no i i want to make sure everybody has
[251.04 - 257.28] at their fingers fingertips dirt cheap
[254.72 - 259.04] in cost at their fingertips they have

[2026.08 - 2030.72] its kind no publisher would ever let an
[2028.24 - 2032.40] author do it plus authors don't have it
[2030.72 - 2034.40] in them from what i heard from my
[2032.40 - 2037.28] publisher to do two at the same moment
[2034.40 - 2039.04] like this so it's the first of its kind
[2037.28 - 2040.96] two books at the same time and the

[2056.56 - 2063.68] info from other sources absolutely
[2061.28 - 2063.68] they are
[2064.16 - 2066.48] right
[2066.80 - 2069.84] but you know that's just the way things
[2068.48 - 2071.28] roll
[2069.84 - 2072.88] all right so i got another book right
[2071.28 - 2074.16] here i got the protocols book right here
[2072.88 - 2075.68] and remember i want to remind you guys
[2074.16 - 2077.44] there's 14 cleanses in here there's an
[2075.68 - 2079.04] advanced heavy metal detox cleanse
[2077.44 - 2080.48] there's seven
[2079.04 - 2084.96] levels
[2080.48 - 2087.68] of heavy metal detox in this book
[2084.96 - 2089.28] seven levels heavy metal detox
[2087.68 - 2090.64] there's something
[2089.28 - 2094.16] that i put a
[2090.64 - 2095.52] like therapy in these books that's
[2094.16 - 2096.88] called brain
[2095.52 - 2098.56] shot
[2096.88 - 2101.52] therapy
[2098.56 - 2104.72] so that's that alone is going to help so
[2101.52 - 2105.84] many people brain shot therapy okay
[2104.72 - 2108.08] yeah
[2105.84 - 2110.00] the problem is when people learn medical
[2108.08 - 2112.40] mean information from other sources out
[2110.00 - 2114.80] there they don't get pointed back to the
[2112.40 - 2117.04] original source instead
[2114.80 - 2118.88] they get given things that can hurt your
[2117.04 - 2121.12] health they'll get told to activate a
[2118.88 - 2123.12] charcoal which will literally tear your
[2121.12 - 2125.28] guts up
[2123.12 - 2127.84] ruin your intestinal tract environment
[2125.28 - 2129.52] it could take years to restore your
[2127.84 - 2131.84] intestinal tract environment after using
[2129.52 - 2134.48] activated charcoal so
[2131.84 - 2136.08] that's just one example of so many right
[2134.48 - 2138.08] anyway the point is they don't know how
[2136.08 - 2139.52] to get back to the original source so
[2138.08 - 2141.04] there's so many tidbits floating out
[2139.52 - 2142.48] there right
[2141.04 - 2144.08] it also you know what's interesting
[2142.48 - 2146.32] about medical medium information getting
[2144.08 - 2148.72] out there like just say celery juice
[2146.32 - 2150.64] people will be drinking celery juice
[2148.72 - 2152.16] and the celery juice will be keeping
[2150.64 - 2154.32] them level
[2152.16 - 2155.84] while they're doing all this bad stuff
[2154.32 - 2157.36] and trendy stuff that's hurting their
[2155.84 - 2158.80] body but they don't know what the celery
[2157.36 - 2161.04] juice is keeping the bad stuff from
[2158.80 - 2162.72] harming them so much so they're taking
[2161.04 - 2165.36] all this other stuff that's bad for them
[2162.72 - 2166.96] like pearl powder a bad collagen a bad
[2165.36 - 2169.20] this about that they're hurting their
[2166.96 - 2171.12] guts and their body
[2169.20 - 2173.04] and then the celery juices actually
[2171.12 - 2174.64] keeping them afloat allowing them to
[2173.04 - 2176.00] hurt themselves with the other stuff
[2174.64 - 2177.52] it's like crazy it's like you go to
[2176.00 - 2179.68] practitioners like oh good you're
[2177.52 - 2181.44] drinking celery juice oh great i hear
[2179.68 - 2183.28] it's good for you yeah yeah you can keep
[2181.44 - 2185.44] that going but here keep up the my
[2183.28 - 2188.08] collagen keep up my pearl powder keep up
[2185.44 - 2190.08] my fulvic minerals keep up my shilajit
[2188.08 - 2192.00] keep up my activated charcoal keep up my
[2190.08 - 2194.24] bentonite clay keep up my meanwhile
[2192.00 - 2195.84] you're tearing your guts apart to shreds
[2194.24 - 2197.92] you're actually you're actually worse
[2195.84 - 2199.60] than conditions but the celery juice is
[2197.92 - 2201.92] keeping you so you kind of don't know it
[2199.60 - 2202.88] so it's allowing unfortunately when you
[2201.92 - 2205.20] don't know where the source of
[2202.88 - 2206.64] information comes from it allows
[2205.20 - 2208.16] people to just
[2206.64 - 2210.88] sell all their garbage to people and
[2208.16 - 2213.28] keep them from getting so sick so fast
[2210.88 - 2215.44] celery just keeps kind of hides what the
[2213.28 - 2218.40] other stuff is doing to them they won't
[2215.44 - 2220.24] notice as much not like the old days
[2218.40 - 2221.52] so let's go into the protocols
[2220.24 - 2224.00] a little bit
[2221.52 - 2227.12] an interesting point right
[2224.00 - 2228.72] you fell for the activated charcoal trap
[2227.12 - 2229.84] a sling
[2228.72 - 2232.16] yeah

[2371.68 - 2375.04] to know how to heal and you'll see here
[2373.68 - 2376.64] vetted now it takes medical medium
[2375.04 - 2378.80] information i mean it's sad to say but
[2376.64 - 2380.40] they're using bits and pieces of
[2378.80 - 2382.16] of mm info now they're talking about
[2380.40 - 2383.84] pathogens aromatic medicine didn't
[2382.16 - 2386.88] believe in pathogens they didn't think
[2383.84 - 2388.08] pathogens existed
[2386.88 - 2391.04] but now all of a sudden everybody
[2388.08 - 2395.64] believes viruses exist well that's been
[2391.04 - 2395.64] 35 years of medical media information
[2396.32 - 2400.16] it's maddening

[2470.16 - 2474.40] i'm looking in here there's ayahuasca
[2472.32 - 2477.60] recovery because so many people get
[2474.40 - 2480.16] brain damaged from ayahuasca in small
[2477.60 - 2482.96] dosages too micro dosing ayahuasca and
[2480.16 - 2485.20] their brains get totally burnt fried
[2482.96 - 2487.68] and like 10 years later they're like
[2485.20 - 2489.20] they're just one big fog
[2487.68 - 2491.04] and they're just bumping in the walls
[2489.20 - 2492.24] the saddest thing i ever see out there

[2492.24 - 2496.56] but yet this shaman did it for me and he
[2494.24 - 2498.24] was the best shaman in the world and i
[2496.56 - 2500.56] get it i'm sure there's some cool
[2498.24 - 2502.72] shamans out there and nice people
[2500.56 - 2504.88] but dude you just burnt up all your
[2502.72 - 2506.72] brain cells
[2504.88 - 2508.24] anyway i'm just saying it's really tough
[2506.72 - 2510.16] a lot of people need recovery from
[2508.24 - 2511.92] ayahuasca so i have it here i'm not
[2510.16 - 2513.84] saying don't do it or do or do whatever
[2511.92 - 2517.60] you want i'm just saying that
[2513.84 - 2519.44] that that recovery protocol is in here
[2517.60 - 2523.68] but what's amazing is
[2519.44 - 2525.52] there's a thorough information into
[2523.68 - 2527.36] like what iowa's good does the brain
[2525.52 - 2529.60] like how it works
[2527.36 - 2532.88] so when you actually consume it what
[2529.60 - 2535.12] happens inside the brain
[2532.88 - 2537.68] that is in the micro dosing chapter when
[2535.12 - 2540.64] you read the micro dosing chapter you're
[2537.68 - 2542.64] just getting like oh my god

[2635.44 - 2638.72] it that's the thing
[2636.64 - 2639.84] coming up because of mm info so many
[2638.72 - 2642.64] people are going to get diagnosed with
[2639.84 - 2644.08] that sarah emma spec says aw what about
[2642.64 - 2646.88] microdosing
