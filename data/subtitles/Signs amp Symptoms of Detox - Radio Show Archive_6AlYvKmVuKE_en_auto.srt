mean I get it people try to survive but

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,840
the thing is is that we're we're talking

65
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,720
about people that are sick and we're

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,120
talking about people that you know

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,599
chronically ill and we're talking about

68
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,040
people that are not well so you know

69
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,319
it's it's resources are minimal for so

70
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,400
many people you know when we write the

71
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,800
medical medium book spirit and I and we

72
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,640
put the information in there and

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,560
spirit's information in there you know

74
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,800
you can get the book in in the library

75
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,440
you don't even have to buy it and you

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,840
can learn how to heal and use your

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,519
resources on a minimal level so that

78
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,400
when you do get things and have to get a

79
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,920
certain supplement or something to help

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,440
you it's going to help you it's not just

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
hey look you wake up one morning it's

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,560
like oh I I you know I trained in this

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,080
this weird school and now I'm going to

84
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,000
be like putting out a program and

85
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,800
selling all the stuff and next thing

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,120
know it's MLM or whatever it is it's not

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,799
like that and the point the reason why

88
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm even talking about this is cuz with

89
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,720
cleanses now you'll see a lot of cleanse

90
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,200
programs cleanse things like you know

91
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,000
and you can buy into all these different

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
things and the thing is is are you

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,760
buying into the right thing some of them

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,480
have all these powdered herbs in there

95
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,319
just all this powdered stuff and

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
powdered shakes and powdered herbs and

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,360
powdered stuff and you know and people

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
they don't know if they're getting

99
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,760
symptoms of detox if they're not getting

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,239
symptoms of detox and all the leaders to

101
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,400
all these different programs all no no

102
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,560
you're detoxing you're detoxing oh no no

103
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,080
that's detox detox without even having

104
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,319
an idea that someone's a getting maybe a

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,879
reigniting a reignition of some kind of

106
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,879
illness or some kind of viral s the

107
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
thing is is this before someone even

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,799
detoxes it would be good to know what

109
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
the hell's going on and what's really

110
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,120
wrong with the person so that's the

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
whole thing too the one thing I don't

112
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,120
like I have to be honest is there's a

113
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
lot of a lot of different experts out

114
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,640
there offering cleansings and cleansing

115
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,560
cleansing cleansing programs or whatever

116
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,560
it is and detox programs and they're

117
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,360
offering these things okay and but they

118
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
don't even know why people are sick they

119
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,159
just think it's all gut health they just

120
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760

just all gut problems you're just toxic

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,319
and it's all gut problems and you have

123
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,000
to detox they have no idea that the

124
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,439
liver may have three or four viruses in

125
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,400

autoimmune disease isn't the body

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,800
attacking itself they have no clue that

131
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,160
it's it's actually viruses inflaming

132
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,880

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,160
got some green juice in it it's got um

185
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,960
now they're bringing celery juice in

186
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
these things but they're not

187
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
contributing to the source where it came

188
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,319
from by the way which is medical medium

189
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
of course you guys know that with the

190
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,960
celery juice and because it went around

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,479
like wildfire and everybody's being

192
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,280
pushed into the band wag and everybody's

193
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,919
jumping on the TR and no one's saying

194
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,440
mean not not every just there there are

195
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,400
some experts out there now they're like

196
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,560
I their egos are so big they're not

197
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,199
going to contribute it to where The

198
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,280
Source came from it's unbelievable it

199
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,400
happens I mean you never thought it

200
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,240
would come to that to this day and I

201
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,680
thought everybody at least had like you

202
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,039
know a little bit more little bit more

203
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,199
something to them it's it's unbelievable

204
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,639
and so the deal is is this is if you go

205
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,080
on to this healthy paleo diet you go

206
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,680
into a healthy animal protein diet you

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,000
go on to something like that and you're

208
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,919
taking away processed foods because

209
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,080
you're used to eating donuts and cookies

210
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,759
you're going to be detoxing you're going

211
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,639
to be detoxing you are it's it's all the

212
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,479
different levels of detoxing and if if

213
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,000
you go on a plant-based diet and it's

214
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,120
just it's a say you go on a vegan

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,360
plant-based diet and it's all cooked

216
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,879
it's all cooked and even though it's

217
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,280
high fat all these diets are high fat

218
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,520
out there by the way you go on a the

219
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,039
vegan um plant-based diet and it's high

220
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,599
fat it's vegan it's all it's all cooked

221
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,319
food plus you know oils and sesame oil

222
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,520
and lots of tahini and nuts and seeds

223
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,440
and everything else you got all this

224
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,000
stuff going on in there and soy and soy

225
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,919
oil and whatever it is that could be in

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,639
it and you got that going on and it's

227
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,360
it's not process there's no processed

228
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,400
food in there the gluten gone the um

229
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
it's vegan there's no eggs and dairy

230
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,479
yeah you're going to be

231
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,879
detoxing but there's different levels of

232
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,319
detoxing there's different stages

233
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,520
there's different places somebody could

234
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,159
be for cleansing and detoxing and that's

235
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,599
kind of how it goes and and you know

236
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,319
it's it's it's

237
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,599
a there's a lot to cover is what we're

238
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,240
about to jump into there's a lot to

239
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,560
cover it it's uh it's diverse it's

240
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
complicated but we're going to going to

241
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,599
simplify it in the best terms and the

242
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,599
best way possible and where to start and

243
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,319
how to go so if you're someone and

244
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,520
you're on kind of a toxic diet you're

245
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,720
eating whatever you're eating bread

246
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,800
you're eating cookies you're eating

247
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,440
different things you're eating some

248
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,199
processed food not all processed food

249
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,800
but a little bit of processed food you

250
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,039
may think that you eat pretty healthy a

251
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,039
lot of people do that they'll be like I

252
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,240
eat pretty healthy I don't eat that bad

253
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,319
I only have a little bit of this a

254
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,919
little bit of that once in a while I

255
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,360
have a bit and then when you really ask

256
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,599
them you crack into it's like two weeks

257
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,759
ago they ate some M&M's you know two

258
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,319
weeks ago a week ago they had soda you

259
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
know what I mean and you you crack into

260
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,839
it it's like a candy bar you know what I

261
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
mean it's like you crack into it and

262
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,080
they they're already eaten some

263
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,039
different things and or they might be

264
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
like I did have a bagel and cream cheese

265
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,599
so I had a bagel and cream cheese and

266
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
they'll be like well I love the New York

267
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
style Bagels I had one you know last

268
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
week and when you really look into it

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,080
they're not eating that good and a lot

270
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,360
of people do this and it's all about

271
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,800
survival it's all about doing the thing

272
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,519
but then then they try to do well I had

273
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,959
a chicken salad so I had chicken on top

274
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,920
of a salad um I had that yesterday that

275
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,079
was healthy they say um for breakfast I

276
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,040
had some oatmeal or I didn't eat at all

277
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,279
I just had my coffee and then I had a

278
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,880
chicken salad for lunch for dinner I had

279
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,720
some salmon and you know but then then

280
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,360
another you know which is not at least

281
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,079
it's not that processed that wasn't that

282
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,279
processed although coffee is processed

283
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,560
even though that's not that processed

284
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,920
it's like so they might actually be like

285
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,279
you know eating a little bit better

286
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
feeling a little bit better just by

287
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,560
doing that exercising whatever it is but

288
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,320
it's all the different layers then if

289
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,360
you go a little bit further like take

290
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,200
away all of those things meaning take

291
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,880
away the bagel and cream cheese you have

292
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,760
take away you know the candy bar that

293
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
they had last week take away um some

294
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,240
kind of doughnut they ate take away

295
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
these different things take away some

296
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,760
kind of fried food they had at with a

297
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,959
friend going take away a slice of pizza

298
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,959
they had one weekend then detoxing

299
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,279
starts to happen if it's a month of wait

300
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,399
a minute I'm not going to have that

301
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,240
slice of pizza wait a minute I know I

302
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,720
listen I know you serious detoxers are

303
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,120
probably laughing right now saying okay

304
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,279
when is he going to get into the serious

305
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,600
stuff because we've already been doing

306
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,399
we've already been cleansing and

307
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,480
detoxing I've done a 30-day 30-day juice

308
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
fast he's got to start going into he's

309
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
what's he talking about I'm we're going

310
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,600
to get there we're going to get there

311
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,880
it's important for you to know all of it

312
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,279
so what happens if that person stops

313
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,360
that slice of pizza twice a month stops

314
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,920
that Bagel twice a

315
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,120
month detoxing happens that's how it

316
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,360
works and there's different levels of

317
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,200
detoxing and that's automatically a

318
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,279
person detoxing it's going to

319
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,399
automatically happen say everybody's

320
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,320
eating clean okay say everybody's eating

321
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,120
clean clean paleo diet no processed food

322
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,880
clean vegan diet no processed food clean

323
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,079
raw vegan diet no processed food of

324
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,880
course clean you know high protein diets

325
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,160
with different fancy names on it no

326
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,560
processed foods everybody's eating clean

327
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,760
right everybody's eating clean and think

328
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,120
about that but they're all eating high

329
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,320
fat so they're all eating clean and

330
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,519
they're all

331
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,920
detoxing better than they would if they

332
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,600
were eating High you know processed

333
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,959
foods I mean processed foods so they're

334
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,279
all detoxing a little bit they're all

335
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,040
detoxing but if they're all on high fat

336
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:21,200
they're not going to detox that much

337
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,240
they're not going to detox that much you

338
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
see where I'm getting I'm getting where

339
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,399
can you be on a diet where you're

340
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,760
detoxing all the time so you don't have

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,360
to do radical crazy detoxes and mess up

342
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,519
your body and make you sick and we're

343
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,519
going to go into that and then as you're

344
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,079
making yourself sick in your radical

345
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,639
detox you're being told by the experts

346
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,279
or the people who sold you the detox or

347
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,240
anything else that you're just detoxing

348
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,320
when really they didn't call the shots

349
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,240
right and your body's going into like a

350
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,600
cyto storm basically it's going into

351
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,040
it's going into a storm and you're and

352
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,800
and meanwhile you know what I mean you

353
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,320
could be definitely detoxing in that

354
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,480
30-day radical cleanse but you could

355
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,760
also be not doing yourself a favor and

356
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
when you come out on the other side you

357
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
could could be feeling better and some

358
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,800
people don't feel better when they come

359
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,760
out of the other side so just hang in

360
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,519
there we're getting we're going to get

361
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,760
there in this show so say you're on all

362
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,360
these clean diets but they're high fat

363
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,480
no processed high fat meaning it's if

364
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,519
it's the Paleo it's chicken and meat and

365
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,000
then you got that twice a day and then

366
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,040
on top of that you got nut Butters in

367
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,760
your smoothies in the morning and you

368
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,720
got something in your coffee some kind

369
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,760
of fat in your coffee or fat in whatever

370
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,560
your water which is ridiculous so you

371
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,560
got all that and then you got the you

372
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,199
know you got the vegans and they're

373
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,920
doing all just avocado they're doing nut

374
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,440
dressings with lots of nuts they're

375
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,800
doing nut and Seed crusts because you

376
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,720
know for little desserts and you put

377
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,199
fruit on top they're putting you know

378
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,079
it's all about nuts seeds some people

379
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,279
are all about oils in the vegan movement

380
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,399
some people are all about lots of

381
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,560
avocado and flax lots of flax going in

382
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,839
lots of flax seed all that flax seed oil

383
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,440
and all that so say you're doing that

384
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,920
okay the thing is is yeah you were

385
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,480
eating cleaner than if you were doing

386
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,600
the processed foods and all the gluten

387
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,160
and everything else you're eating

388
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
cleaner so you are detoxing to a certain

389
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
degree and people get some benefits

390
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,440
they're like whoa I switched to vegan

391
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,040
and I came out of a processed food diet

392
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,320
or a junky diet switched to vegan it's

393
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,800
really been helping me but you're still

394
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,600
on this high fat diet and you're not

395
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,120
going to cleanse that much past that

396
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,560
point you're going not going to detox

397
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,320
that much that past that point right

398
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,560
same thing with the belet paleo diet or

399
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,839
any kind of high fat high protein diet

400
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,680
you're getting out of the processed food

401
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,880
and you're going to be doing a little

402
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,720
bit better you're going to be exercising

403
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,040
you might lose a couple of pounds you

404
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
might gain it back later but you might

405
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,760
lose a couple of pounds you're

406
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,839
exercising and you're detoxing a little

407
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
you're feeling a little better you got

408
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,240
the junk out of your system you're not

409
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,199
going to get a you're not going to eat

410
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,639
pizza and but you're but you're detoxing

411
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:53,360
only to a point to a point there's so

412
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:56,399
many layers and steps and when people go

413
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,160
from from 100 to Ground Zero whatever it

414
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,279
is you call it and they miss out on all

415
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,480
the

416
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,079
steps they detox yes but they also can

417
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,759
make themselves sick sick with their

418
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,800
detoxing program and it becomes just a

419
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,199
whole Calamity a whole bunch of Calamity

420
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,920
and then after their cleanses they don't

421
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
even know how to eat right afterwards or

422
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,560
where they're going and they're back

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,839
into confusion

424
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,360
land and I'm going to talk about signs

425
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,959
and symptoms and all that when you're

426
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,120
doing that but and and and say for

427
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,720
detoxes that are intense we're going to

428
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,800
cover that it's early in the show we're

429
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,519
we're going to get there

430
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,680
so then the next level is lowering those

431
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,480
fats so you're on these clean diets

432
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,000
clean paleo clean high protein clean

433
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,519
vegan clean raw raw vegan clean

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,720
vegetarian whatever now you're lowering

435
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,959
the

436
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,360
fats and it's just like the like the

437
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,720
vegetarian the vegetarian that's saying

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
well I don't eat processed foods I don't

439
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
eat gluten I'm a vegetarian but I do eat

440
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,440
some fish I do eat some eggs well you

441
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,959
got you know high fat in the fish you

442
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,880
got high fat in the eggs got high fat in

443
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,199
the cheese and you start bringing that

444
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,720
down and and vegetarians still eat

445
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,160
avocado and they still eat lots of nuts

446
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,079
so you got high fats and all those and

447
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,959
you bring all that down same thing and

448
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,800
so the deal is when you bring the fats

449
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,920
down that's when the cleansing really

450
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:15,600
happens that's when the cleansing really

451
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,320
happens on a safe level on a safe

452
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,759
level no one knows what happens inside

453
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,279
their body you can be the greatest

454
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,040

455
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,800

460
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,079

you got to know that that when you

490
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,880
really think about the irony or or when

491
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,399
you think about how ridiculous it is of

492
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,920
like okay you know what's happening in

493
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,399
the body you know what the liver's doing

494
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,560
you know what the kidneys are doing you

495
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,000
know what the intestinal tract's doing

496
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
and I love a lot of these guys they're

497
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,800
just like oh yeah know the intestinal

498
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,480
track's doing this oh how do you know

499
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,120
how do you really know it's amazing so

500
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,839
so when it comes down to Cleansing you

501
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,799
have to look at the liver and you have

502
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,480
to look at it with respect you have to

503
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,160
not push it you have to not M you have

504
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,600
to not push it over you can't you can't

505
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,959
you know what happens is it's like the

506
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,160
first time your child goes to a diving

507
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:33,440
board in a poll and and and and wants to

508
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,200
dive off and is standing there scared

509
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,720
and it's like somebody coming behind her

510
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,520
or him and just pushing her in in the

511
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,679
water and it's it's just you can't push

512
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,000
your liver to doing something you have

513
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,919
to give it a chance you have to work

514
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,919
with it gently and carefully cuz it will

515
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,919
push

516
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,760
back it will push back and you know and

517
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,640
that that can happen just like if you

518
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,559
push your son or your daughter off off

519
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,559
the diving board too early in life when

520
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,840
they're too young what they might push

521
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,159
back and they might not want to do it

522
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,600
again they might not want hot get on

523
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,720
that diving board ever again you just

524
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,840
don't even know so what happens is that

525
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,600
the liver doesn't like to be pushed hard

526
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,280
you got these people on on all these you

527
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,960
know regular you know standard American

528
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,480
diets of course and then you push them

529
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,760
into these radical cleanses you sell

530
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,159
them and then they waffle and they don't

531
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,559
even know how to eat afterwards they

532
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,600
just waffle in between they're still

533
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,840
binging on Pizza still binging on their

534
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,120
old their old patterns it's it's about

535
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,679
gradually getting someone to cleanse and

536
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,200
heal not pushing the liver overboard

537
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,640
because you don't know what's in

538
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,799
somebody's liver let me tell you

539
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,640

underdog it hasn't been easy for them

638
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,919
but the deal is the deal is on both

639
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,240
sides of the aisle okay you lower the

640
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,720
fats and then you start to cleanse and

641
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,640
you prepare your body how many overt

642
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,799
fats did I have I was back to chicken

643
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,400
chicken high in fat I don't care who

644
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,039
what where I don't care what scale you

645
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,520
can hop on the internet how much fat is

646
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,360
in 4 ounces of chicken breast and it'll

647
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,520
lie to you because those are government

648
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,799
standards of how much fat is in a piece

649
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,799
of chicken every Farm is different every

650
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,120
chicken is different one chicken could

651
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,520
have three times more fat than another

652
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,159
chicken how can a standard be written in

653
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,600
how can they have a standard that's

654
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,080
utterly

655
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:47,960
insane every tree is different some

656
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:50,679
trees I I've had nut trees in my life my

657
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,240
great-grandfather had nut trees I

658
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,120
remember one walnut tree being so high

659
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,039
in fat it was insane it was like eating

660
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,480
a buttered it was like eating a buttered

661
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,080
croissant and then his other walnut tree

662
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,960
a different variety and it was and um

663
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,600
you know a different variety it had

664
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,880
hardly any fat it was like it was like

665
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,080
it was like fat free almost and then

666
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,720
there was this other peacan tree he had

667
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,480
which was grown it was grown on a

668
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,679
different part of the farm little farm

669
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,840
there on his property and you I remember

670
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,880
my great-grandfather and that peacan

671
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,960
tree it was like it was really rich and

672
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,880
then at my aunt's house her peacan tree

673
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,960
same kind of pean grown on different

674
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,559
soil at her house it had it was like low

675
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,360
fat barely any fat probably cut in half

676
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,159
to a quarter how is it possible to just

677
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,840
say oh how much Fat's in nuts here put

678
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,679
it on dial it in the computer how much

679
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,919
Fat's in this chicken every single Farm

680
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
is a the chicken has a different racial

681
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,200
fat and some of them are so high in fat

682
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
it's insane I don't care if it's if it's

683
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,360
pasture Ray free range it could be be

684
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,720
really high in fat the same thing with

685
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,520
any kind of animal product so what

686
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,200
happens is that you got to bring your

687
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,799
animal products down a little bit and

688
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,120
you start to cleanse you don't have to

689
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,840
stop them all together if you love

690
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,320
animal protein and then if you're vegan

691
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,200
you got to bring your nuts and seeds

692
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,960

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,840
trying to teach you how to read your own

719
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,760
body and give you information in order

720
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,840
for you to do it so you can be in a good

721
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,679
place and that's what I'm trying to do

722
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,080
so you can be in a good place so you

723
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,320
could read your own body so when you

724
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,159
lower your fats and you're a plant-based

725
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,960
uh you know girl or guy and you're

726
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,200
plant-based and you start bringing down

727
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
nuts and seeds and the oils you start

728
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,840
bringing down the avocado and you get

729
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,440
more lower fat more lower fat when

730
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,559

733
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,679

mean grass-fed butter will literally

755
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,399
shut down a cleanse in 10 seconds you

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,960
want to shut down your cleanse you want

757
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,840

let you cleanse I'm just saying okay so

763
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,799
the deal is is when you bring down these

fats you're cleansing on a deeper level

765
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,760
and you're getting your body ready ready

766
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,159
so when you buy into something and

767
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,679
hopefully you don't buy into something

768
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,320
that's not good like be cautious with

769
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,240
all the powders meaning buy into cleanse

770
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,880
like cleansing powder programs and and

771
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,720
all these powders you put in smoothies

772
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,080
or put in water and just be really

773
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,679
really cautious with all of that garbage

774
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,000
you'll find natural flavors in that

775
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,559
stuff and the ones you don't find

776
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,440
natural flavors there probably glutamic

777
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,559
acid naturally in there I mean there's

778
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,640
all kinds of things are thrown in there

779
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,799
it you just got to be careful and the

780
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,039
Linings of the gut and intestinal tract

781
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,240
small intestinal track the stomach

782
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,080
lining everything gets so irritated and

783
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,760
earable from all that all those powders

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,960
all going in there and in the name of

786
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,600
cleansing you and meanwhile it could

787
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,320
activates something it could activate

788
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,679

know and the thing is is that made a lot

832
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,080
of sense to me and he and he said to me

833
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,480
he said because I've been through all

834
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,600
these other things and I've tried these

835
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,039
different things and programs and

836
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,960
different concepts and they give you all

837
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,519
this stuff they tell you this but it's

838
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,679
but it's not really what's happening and

839
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,720
you lose all

840
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,120
navigation and the thing I want you guys

841
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,720
to be able to navigate I want you be

842
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,039
able to kind of be able to find your way

843
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,519
through and so when you lower the fats

844
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,440
it's the first first it's a first big

845
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,440
step after the second big step is no no

846
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,519
junk food you know no pizzas no cakes

847
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,600
cookies donuts no Bagels no gluten no

848
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,799
cheese no eggs and then you you drop you

849
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,799
know I don't care if you you know

850
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,480

851
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,360

854
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,760
and then then you're in a you're in a

855
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,320
better place and then you're doing the

856
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,960
low fat you're bringing the low fats

857
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,640
down and you're getting ready so if you

858
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,880
want to do a cleanse like the medical

859
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,799
medium 28-day

860
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,960
cleanse man you're actually already

861
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,399

862
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,600
be cleansing gently without making

863
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,519
yourself sick pushing your liver too far

864
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,880
the problem is when you do radical

865
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,039
cleansing and you jump into it your

866
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,159
liver

867
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,639
expels all this poison but it has to

868
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,279
bring it back up meaning like the liver

869
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:07,919
will take it back in it's not like the

870
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:10,720
liver the liver will literally bring it

871
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,480
back in to protect you and then it'll

872
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
learn it shouldn't let anything out

873
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,440

878
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,159

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,720
and you have to get yourself to a place

898
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
where you're you're respecting your body

899
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,519
respecting your liver and you're not

900
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,799
dumping too much junk in there while

901
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,200
you're doing it juices are a great

902
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,600
cleansing tool all the crazy

903
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,760
powders that cleansing programs sell I

904
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,320
would

905
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,799
ignore because you'll never know if you

906
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,480
made yourself sick or if you're

907
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,320

913
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,440
know what's making you sick versus

914
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,000
what's detoxing you and so forth or

915
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,240
irritating or scratching your lining or

916
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,880
whatever it is or overburdening

917
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,679
something you just you don't know so all

918
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,600
the

919
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,720
powders they all have to go when you're

920
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,240
actually doing doing something more

921
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,360
radical a cleanse like you're doing a

922
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,880
juice cleanse or something else they

923
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,960
have to go it's important to know and so

924
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,919
you know and another thing too if you're

925
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,159
going to do any kind of radical

926
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,480
cleansing don't run around doing errands

927
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,960
all day don't have life going about like

928
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,840
crazy and you're running around and

929
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,519
you're doing all these things and you

930
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,679
don't don't I wouldn't do that I would

931
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,760
try to like plan on some downtime some

932
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,720
chill time and if you can't do that I

933
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,519
understand but I would try to have some

934
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,480
downtime some chill

935
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,880
time and and and expect to keep it

936
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,600
lowkey even if it's a 10-day cleanse

937
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
5-day cleanse 5day juice cleanse

938
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,200
whatever 7 7-Day juice cleanser whatever

939
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,760
it is you got to back down your schedule

940
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,840
itinerary you have to just kind of like

941
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
okay let's just calm down let's not run

942
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,120
around like a mad person let's not try

943
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,679
to do all these things because that's

944
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,519
not good because your

945
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,559
detox will be different cuz your body

946
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,639
will know you're actually exhausting

947
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,679
itself so it will hold back its poisons

948
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:02,720
you'll actually hinder your detox if

949
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,919
you're doing too much while you're

950
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,359
detoxing while you're

951
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,399
detoxing so here's the deal like the

952
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,320
medical medium 20day 28 28 day cleanse

953
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,399
is one way you can cleanse safely and

954
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,480
you can do it longer term and sustain

955
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:25,119
yourself so you can

956
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,879
actually uh ignite healing okay that's

957
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,000
one way of doing it you know I have I

958
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,159
have a

959
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,320
90day 90-day thyroid okay thyroid detox

960
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,240
and thyroid cleans and heal and

961
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,960
everything else and thyroid healing but

962
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,560
Liver Rescue has a 9-day cleanse for the

963
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,200
liver and it's and it's going to involve

964
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,440
some food and it's going to involve some

965
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,359
juices and the thing is is that that's

966
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,800
the healthier ways of doing it it's

967
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,440

and signs and everything

971
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,680
else okay so you went from processed

972
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,760

and everything else and cheese and

975
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,800
butter and fried foods you went from

976
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,320
that to a clean paleo clean protein

977
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,280

worse these are all little signs then

985
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,079

your fats whether it's high protein um

987
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,400

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,880
doing now that's what people do now

994
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,560

1036
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,760
little bloating for a moment little

1037
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,119
bloating and cramping but you might be

1038
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,800
experiencing all these things before you

1039
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,000
even went into any of this but these are

1040
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,480
some signs of of detox right here and

1041
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,440
you can be experiencing it with problems

1042
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,800
you have with your liver and your

1043
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,640
intestinal tract before going into

1044
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,000
cleanses and then you can experience the

1045
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,280
same thing while you're

1046
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,760
detoxing and so these are these are all

1047
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
things but yet you're getting increased

1048
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,160
energy you're feeling better you're

1049
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,960
doing it right you're lowering your fats

1050
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,440
and then you can take your fats out all

1051
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,160
together you're 100% fat free 100% fat

1052
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,480
free which

1053
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,119
means if you're paleo if you're high

1054
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,800
protein you're off animal protein for a

1055
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,680
little while so now you're in like a

1056
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,040
real cleanse you're in a real cleanse

1057
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
now cuz you can't cleanse you can't

1058
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,760
really cleanse deeper if you're on

1059
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,720
chicken and meat I'm saying there's

1060
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,560
nothing wrong with eating chicken or

1061
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,359
meat but you're really you're not going

1062
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,240
to be able to cleanse like really

1063
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,599
cleanse on a deeper level and if you're

1064
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,680
vegan you're not going to be able to

1065
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,480
really cleanse at all on nuts and seeds

1066
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,040
cuz the nuts and seeds are the chicken

1067
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,400
and the meat you see how it works the

1068
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,520
nut seeds are the chicken the meat the

1069
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,599
fish that's how it is for the pale a

1070
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,319
guy and so once you take out those fats

1071
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,680
you're now cleansing on a deeper level

1072
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,359
now you're fat free for a while you can

1073
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,319
be fat free for a week you fat free for

1074
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,000
2 weeks and guess what the 28 day

handle that for 2 weeks if you can

1097
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,400
handle that for 3 weeks or 4 weeks then

1098
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,640
you can handle something more radical

1099
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,200
you can actually handle an actual

1100
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,480
cleanse in a deeper level there's

1101
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,319
nothing worse than going from you know

1102
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,000
point A to point Z literally by not you

1103
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:46,319
know that's like shocking the body and

1104
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,359
the reason why I'm going into this part

1105
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,800
of the of this radio show is when you

1106
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:51,760
shock the body you know what happens

1107
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,000
your immune system drops and

1108
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,359
crashes your immune system

1109
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,760
crashes that's what happens and a lot of

1110
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,359
people who have to cleanse and do things

1111
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,319
and everything they're already sick they

1112
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,599

1113
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,920

methylation issues and everything else

1119
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,520
under under the sun they already have

1120
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,520
all these things headaches migraines

1121
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,920
balance issues weaknesses they already

1122
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,160

1123
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,599
that and so when you're already having

1124
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,560
all that and it's already viral and

1125
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,400
everything else Under the Sun and you

1126
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,040

just think you're' just been toxic

1142
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,960
there's a lot of detox Specialists are

1143
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,359
like Oh no you're just toxic they don't

1144
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,560
even know the person has a viral issue

1145
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,359
they have no

1146
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,000
idea and

1147
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,800
so and they might be spouting out

1148
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,359
viruses now because of what we did at

1149
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,920
Medical medium of of teaching the world

1150
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,400
right now about how viruses work and why

1151
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,240
everybody's sick but but the thing is

1152
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,119
you just don't even know and then you're

1153
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,000
kind of like in cahoots you're you're

1154
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,960
you're you're reignited your immune

1155
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,240
system is is is locked down and shut

1156
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,000
down you reignited a a viral issue now

1157
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,000
you're trying to recoup from your your

1158
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,920
healer is saying no you're detoxing

1159
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,640
detoxing detoxing that happens all the

1160
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,319
time but when you do it the right way

1161
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,839
your immune system stays strong your

1162
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,000
body won't be

1163
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,079
shocked that's why like the 28 day

1164
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,640
cleanse in medical medium book one or

1165
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,440
90-day thy thyroid rehab or or the um or

1166
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,040
The Liver Rescue The Liver Rescue 369

1167
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,760
you guys will see the deal is is

1168
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,520
that is the bottom line is

1169
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,960
you got to treat your body with respects

1170
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,319
it'll treat you back with respect

1171
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,960
because you got to remember we're the

1172
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:05,880
ones not entirely our fault but it's

1173
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,760
part of our fault about dirtying up our

1174
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,560
bodies it's partly our fault it's not

1175
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,040
all of our fault the rest is the fact

1176
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,480
that the world is that toxic and we come

1177
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,119
into this world as a baby already with

1178
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,200
toxins in our liver in our body it's has

1179
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,800
nothing to do with us and then there's

1180
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,760
this one little part that has something

1181
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,920
to do with us but it's really not

1182
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,480
entirely our fault just a fraction of it

1183
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,160
is because you know we we kind we tend

1184
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,800
to know better now in this day and age

1185
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,760
not to eat that buttered croissant but

1186
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,119
we do it anyway but it's really I get it

1187
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,760
we're under stress we're under pressure

1188
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,400
we're just we're in survival mode we

1189
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,280
just eat what we need to eat and I get

1190
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,280
it you know it's probably not you know

1191
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,800
exactly but the thing is that we still

1192
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,280
there's some responsibility that we have

1193
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,839
is what I mean and we can't push we

1194
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,440
can't push the liver in the other parts

1195
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,040
of the body we got to be really careful

1196
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,000
so when you do the fat free you're

1197
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,400
already preparing yourself if you can do

1198
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,839
fat free for 3 Days whether you're

1199
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,559
somebody who's high protein Paley or

1200
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,400
you're somebody who's vegan if you can

1201
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,920
do fat free for 3 to 4 days what a great

1202
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,880
place that puts you in incredible you'll

1203
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,359
be detoxing and cleansing you might get

1204
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,839
and if you're really toxic here's

1205
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,000
another thing everybody's body is filled

1206
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,160
with something different some people's

1207
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
bodies are filled with tons of

1208
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,160
pharmaceuticals some people's bodies are

1209
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,079
filled with DDT DDT I swear to God I kid

1210
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,240
you not DDT from literally their

1211
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,559
forefathers I it's unbelievable some

1212
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
people are filled with Mercury some

1213
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,200
people are filled with all kinds of

1214
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,599

people have lots of virus a lot of

1216
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,240
people everybody's got a viral issue

1217
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,520
somewhere in there it was one or another

1218
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,400
and we got all these different things

1219
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,520
going on inside of us and some people

1220
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,640
much more some people much less so

1221
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,520
somebody doing fat free for seven days

1222
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,839
it's a big deal for them cleanse and at

1223
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,640
least keep their immune system strong

1224
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,040
and cleanse and and thank God they don't

1225
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:56,079
go radical someone else somebody else

1226
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,880
you know who's really really yeah who's

1227
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,800
who's not as toxic or more toxic

1228
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,520
whatever it's going to have a different

1229
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,359
thing they when they're doing the 7-Day

1230
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,680
or 5day or 3-day low fat but it's a

1231
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,040
great way to get you in a place to

1232
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,640
protect you it's a great way it's a

1233
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,160
great it's a great scale to kind of come

1234
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,559
down on a cliff to come down carefully

1235
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,200
on so you're protected you protect you

1236
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,280
that's the whole point with cleanses so

1237
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,839
you can do more radical if you can do

1238
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,839
fat free whatever aisle you're on in

1239
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,920
food belief system and bring in more

1240
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,720
fruits and vegetables and do smoothies

1241
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,760
and everything else you're going to be

1242
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,760
in a lot better place you're cleansing

1243
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,119
already and you're not going to kill

1244
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,119
your immune system for a while you're

1245
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,280
not going to drop it you're not going to

1246
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,880
kick the crap out of your immune system

1247
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,559
so that whatever's lurking doesn't come

1248
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,440
raging out and that's the difference

1249
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,520
between that's what happens is all these

1250
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,440
detoxes out there and you get sick

1251
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,480
people doing them and they go through

1252
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,400
hell and back partly because they're

1253
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,400
filled with all these irritating powders

1254
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,359
in their gut but lining and it's just

1255
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,240
making them absolutely miserable the

1256
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,040
other part is it totally annihilates

1257
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,720
their immune system so that their

1258
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,200
viruses whatever made them sick for the

1259
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,200
last 20 years is coming out full force

1260
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,880
then when you start recovering from all

1261
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,800
that it's like a relief cuz you've just

1262
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,079
been through Hing back you may not even

1263
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,839
be better than you were before you

1264
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,720
started but you feel like you're

1265
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,599
recovering thank God so then you're like

1266
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,240
oh yeah I went through the biggest detox

1267
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,720
of my life and you're just back to

1268
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,599
square one from when you started I've

1269
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,680
seen that happen guess what thousands of

1270
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:30,079
times over the years and you don't want

1271
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,760
it to happen that way you want to know

1272
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,599
if you're really sick if you really got

1273
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,200
sick in your detox you want to know it's

1274
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:40,559
a real detox

1275
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,359
happening so that means you do the low

1276
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,559
fat for a while or you do the 28 day

1277
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,839
cleanse and if you want to go to

1278
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,359
something more radical and you want to

1279
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,079
do juices only all day

1280
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,000
long and you can you do juices on a

1281
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,000
juice fast we're doing juice and water

1282
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,920
every day juice or lemon water and then

1283
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,720
juices cucumber juices celery juices

1284
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,599
other green juices and you want to do

1285
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:05,599
that if you get really sick that is your

1286
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,839
body cleansing Full Throttle full

1287
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,920
force if you don't you're Pro you're not

1288
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,160
going to probably also get unless you're

1289
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,800
really toxic is what I'm saying cuz the

1290
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,720
ma majority of people that aren't that

1291
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,200
toxic like well you know it depends

1292
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,520
there's I mean people are really sick

1293
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,480
and toxic there's no question so be like

1294
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,760
half and half you get 50% people that

1295
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,240
are only like certain toxic level and if

1296
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,920
they're cleansing like that doing the

1297
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,119
juices and everything like that and you

1298
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,119
nav you know they're just going to be

1299
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,200
like oh my God yeah I know I feel it I

1300
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,599
feel tired that's what they'll get I

1301
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,440
feel

1302
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,119
tired and then you get these other

1303
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,920
people that are so toxic they'll just

1304
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,280
like I feel sick I just oh my God I

1305
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,960
can't function I got to lay down I got

1306
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,440
to just rest all that poison coming

1307
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,839
out but at least you prepared yourself

1308
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,720
and got you in in in the right way for

1309
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,559
detoxing and cleansing unless what

1310
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,800
people don't realize you got a fever

1311
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:57,599
10034 someone's saying you're detoxing

1312
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,559
or am I detoxing cuz I had a smoothie

1313
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,520
and a celery juice the fever is because

1314
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:04,160
you got the flu people catch it all the

1315
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,720
time and I mean they they catch a flu

1316
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,119
they catch what what happens or a sty

1317
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,720
you can catch really easily or you

1318
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,800
picked up you picked up food poisoning

1319
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,319
because you went and ate somewhere at

1320
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,800
some restaurant and you blame the detox

1321
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,880
un like you're you're vomiting your

1322
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,559
diarrhea that's not that's not possible

1323
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,160
for a smoothie that's not possible for

00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,480
gentle detoxing and everything else so

1325
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,880

00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,280
of cleanse is not going to make you

1364
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:51,280
viral like a virus come out or make some

1365
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,040
bacteria go wild when when the detox

1366
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,599
expert thinks that that back that that

1367
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,480
you know that you're just experiencing

1368
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,599
detox

1369
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,359
no you

1370
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,960
know so anyway as far as other radical

1371
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,920
cleansing if you're doing water fasting

1372
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,119
whatever you jump yourself into just

1373
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,400
don't try not to run around keep busy

1374
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,799
try not to do this just kind of like

1375
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,839
stay at home read you know watch watch

1376
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:17,520
you know videos on your computer just

1377
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,440
you know do things like that keep it

1378
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,799
chill if you do any water

1379
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,799
fasting um if you do anything like that

1380
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:28,440
you do any cleansing like on that level

1381
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:31,079
but going from high processed or or high

1382
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,119
clean high fat diet right to radical

1383
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,880
cleansing you're not going to be able to

1384
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,200
navigate what you're really doing with

1385
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,359
your detox especially if there are

1386
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,079
products someone's telling you you have

1387
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,400
to ingest during the course of that and

1388
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,040
if they're not telling you to do that

1389
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,119
and you're just going from point you

1390
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,799
know point A to point Z like that and

1391
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,839
you're experiencing detox yeah you're

1392
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:53,200
going to be detoxing without a doubt but

1393
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,640
you're not going to really be able to

1394
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,160
navigate through it you should come down

1395
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:02,480
come down carefully like I said come

1396
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,079
down carefully and safely you know get

1397
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,480
out of the bad foods to begin with

1398
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,000
processed foods get out of dairy

1399
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,680
products get out of eggs get out of

1400
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,520

bad grains the bad ones get out of all

1403
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,839
that come down the

1404
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,599
ladder and then when you're sitting here

1405
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,000
whether you're in your high protein land

1406
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,839
or in your high high you know when your

1407
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,440
vegan land come down on the overt fats

1408
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:31,960
bring them down lower the chicken lower

1409
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,079
the meat lower the nuts lower the oils

cleanse go over it fat free for the

1415
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,760
Paleo and high protein people that means

00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,599
juices I prefer celery juice because

1428
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,240
you're at least going to be taking care

1429
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,599
of your liver and and your brain and

1430
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,200
everything else and I prefer the heavy

1431
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,640
metal detox smoothie this way you're

1432
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,160
capturing all heavy metals in case

1433
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,160
something starts to detox so that's what

1434
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,760
I prefer I'm saying if you want to do it

1435
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,160
the right way and include you know

1436
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,720
bringing out those overt fats and you're

1437
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,000
bringing that down bringing it down and

1438
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,280
then you want to do something more

1439
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,799
radical that you want to buy into

1440
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,960
somebody else's plan or you want to buy

1441
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:35,200
into something like that or you want to

1442
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,599
go search on the internet and you find

1443
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,559
this other detox thing and you want to

1444
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,079
do something like that at least you're

1445
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,680
actually going to be safer because

1446
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,799
medical medium got you safer in a safer

1447
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,520
place in a better place prepared for it

1448
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:50,640
so you might be able to navigate better

1449
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,319
but but stay away from them you know to

1450
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,160
too much of the crazy stuff and some of

1451
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,280
you might might you know do love juice

1452
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,160
fast fasting periodically well you

1453
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,839
should be doing it this way before you

1454
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,520
go into your juice fasting whatever that

1455
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:04,040
is that you that you're buying into or

1456
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,160
you found or someone else is teaching

1457
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,400
you how to do make sure you do this

1458
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,960
stuff before you do

1459
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,200
that so all of this is

1460
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,680
important so what happens is when people

1461
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,760
get pushed into cleanses and stuff they

1462
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,799
get confused because couple things could

1463
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,799
happen their immune system dropped they

1464
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:23,400
reignited total sickness that they've

1465
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:26,200
already had for 10 20 years and they're

1466
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,839
being told they're just detoxing

1467
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,559
okay that happens a lot seeing it over

1468
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,559
and over and over again and what I mean

1469
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:34,079
that's somebody curled up in agony pain

1470
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:37,000
feeling sick rashes all this other stuff

1471
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,760
and then you get people you know that

1472
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,720
that you know they they don't have that

1473
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,280
going on and they're just doing all

1474
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,880
these Powers all this stuff all these

1475
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,920
protein pows all the real cleansing

1476
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,079
powders whatever and their just guts are

1477
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,839
sick I've seen people like their guts

1478
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,720
are sick because all that powder is like

1479
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:55,000
literally scratching the Linings and

1480
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,240
inflaming the Linings and it's not good

1481
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,559
for them at all and you see those people

1482
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,920
and they're on the toilet and they're

1483
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,400
just like on the toilet and they're like

1484
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,440
I think I saw a worm they're on the

1485
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,880
toilet I think I saw something I think I

1486
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,040
saw this and that and you know there's a

1487
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,400
whole bunch of people that do that and

1488
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,319
and the detox Specialists are like oh

1489
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,640
you're detoxing you're on all these

1490
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,359
you're on all these things you're just

1491
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,960
you know what I mean it's it's it's it's

1492
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:16,640
madness out there be

1493
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,559
careful you can do it a different way

1494
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,200
you can do it a way that the body you

1495
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,680
could res respect your body so your body

1496
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,240
can respect you so that if you do

1497
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,920
something like I'm going to do a juice

1498
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,760

1499
