[0.16 - 6.56] There is a lot of land people do not see
[2.88 - 11.36] or walk on. There are a lot of woods,
[6.56 - 14.08] forests, mountains, hills, valleys that
[11.36 - 18.72] people are not allowed on. government
[14.08 - 22.56] land, classified land, land for testing,
[18.72 - 25.68] land for mining, or just endless swaths
[22.56 - 28.56] of land, vast amount of acres that
[25.68 - 31.44] nobody has access to. And even private
[28.56 - 34.64] land nobody has access to, but the birds
[31.44 - 37.04] do. They have access to this land. And
[34.64 - 40.96] the majority of the birds fly and die
[37.04 - 44.80] over this land, die from chemtrails and
[40.96 - 47.28] land on the land dead or dying. And no
[44.80 - 50.56] one sees it. Millions and millions of
[47.28 - 52.88] birds over the years have fallen into
[50.56 - 56.00] these federal lands, into these private
[52.88 - 58.80] lands, into these forests, these hills,
[56.00 - 62.08] these valleys, on these mountains, and
[58.80 - 65.28] the death is not seen. These birds are
[62.08 - 65.28] not seen.
