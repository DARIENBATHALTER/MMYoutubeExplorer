the wonderful things that we're both

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,490
doing and they are like educating people

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,890
about so that's really important for

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,140
people to know well you've always caring

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,239
about like what people put on their

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,129
bodies you care about like it's like

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,110
your core organics it's about like

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,329
skincare that doesn't have bad chemicals

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,040
in it so it's unified organic yeah

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,440
because what you put on your skin soaks

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,450
into your bloodstream exactly it's

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,920
really important that we're conscious of

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,570
what we're doing and putting on our skin

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,399
and make an educated choice about it

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,780
yeah yeah and you've always known this

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,309
stuff for years and that's what's so

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,739
cool because your lines been out for a

27
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,660
while now yeah it's really established

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,359
because it's so healthy for the skin and

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,369
so it's like you know a lot about what

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,689
people should do and you know I remember

31
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,220
we were talking recently and you're like

32
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,780
no I don't like the scented candles with

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,549
the chemicals and there are some simple

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,970
things that people actually don't

35
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,430
realize and when you understand and you

36
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,200
can see what what is you know if you

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,360
read the ingredients and whatnot on the

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,920
back of any household goods what's in

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,570
your hair shampoo what's in your

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,369
products that you're putting on your

41
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,590
skin then you make an educated choice

42
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,900
and say okay well I'm gonna have that or

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,119
I'm not gonna moon it you know yeah and

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,790

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,680
as much as possible and make educated

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,430
choices about it and I feel like that is

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,899
the best you can do really no I know you

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,610
you eat really clean and that's what

50
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,159

think it's gonna be this like really

54
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,850
harsh detox or something but it's not

55
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,380

even be a bit of a bigger bigger one

60
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,520
than

61
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,970
that's a small one with my celery juice

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,060
in the morning I have 32 ounces cool

63
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,480
that's perfect I tell people I started

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,250
like this yeah 32 ounces I'm doing so

65
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,290
much yeah and you know everyone in my

66
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,800
family is drinking celery now even Flynn

67
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,380
no way Evan Evan loves e celery he's

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,330
like he didn't in the beginning he's

69
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,220
like oh it's probably not gonna make a

70
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,740
difference and now I see he even tells

71
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,840
his friends celery celery you've got to

72
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,420
get on it's so good it helps just with

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,380
like the brain fog with energy levels

74
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,640
with just health in general I know every

75
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,020
now and then you'll hear out there like

76
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,150
there's some naysayers saying don't

77
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,070
drink celery juice you don't want a

78
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,440
juice celery you want to keep the fiber

79
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,930
and I'm always like no no no what this

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,910
is an herbal this is an herbal power

81
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,970
right here it's a table medicine

82
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,240
alkaline system yeah fast though like

83
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,460
fast versus slow alkalinity it actually

84
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,930
alkaline this quickly and that's

85
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,670
something that happens too that's why

86
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,170
people get relief with acid reflux

87
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,380
almost immediately

88
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,110
yes and all of that actually when I was

89
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,260
younger I had a little bit of acid

90
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,710
reflux and I think it was emotional at

91
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,270
the time because I had lost my boyfriend

92
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,760
he had passed away instantly in a car

93
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,520
accident and I had to worry and concern

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,790
and that had brought like kind of you

95
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,050
know how emotion you have a loss I've

96
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,430
talked about that in the medical meeting

97
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,860
books they talked about that in medical

98
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,270
media book one and they're some of the

99
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,300
other medical media books that like when

100
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:52,540
you get that great loss and and

101
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,300
something so so hard and a struggle like

102
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,880
that it's it could really hit you hard

103
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,590
too on a whole nother but I wish that I

104
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,300
had known about celery juice back then

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,360
because it would have really helped like

106
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,370
soothe soothe my digestion and now it

107
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,690
does every day which I'm so great well

108
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,850
you've been doing it long term too

109
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,320
that's what's cool like and I tell

110
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,520
people I tell you guys out there all the

111
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
time and I tell other people I run into

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,750
all the time you just don't do it for

113
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,700
just five days don't do it for and to

114
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,530
seven days and you're done and every day

115
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,960
every day yeah and you're doing every

116
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:27,610
day for a long time now

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,319
for a couple yeah that's really cool and

118
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,789
this made the biggest difference and

119
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,380
continues to make the biggest difference

120
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,130
to my health and I thought I was healthy

121
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,050
before I met you and you have taught me

122
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,050
so much more than what I even thought

123
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,819
you know I even thought was even out

124
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,430
there and obviously every day we're

125
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,680
learning more and more and sure and

126
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,280
that's obviously what life is about but

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,590
it's these simple things like the celery

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,930
juice like having the banana and

129
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,820
actually potatoes yeah I love

130
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,500
everybody's afraid about that I love the

131
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,460
fact that you're really all about

132
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,620
potatoes and incorporating like potatoes

133
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,349
steamed potatoes into your diet and not

134
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,070
being afraid of the cards yeah

135
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,990
because they've also been like since I

136
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,940
met you a staple in my diet that's

137
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,639
incredible and the potatoes have been

138
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,009

that book I mean potatoes play a big

143
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,650
role in that it's really important

144
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,150
because there's you can mono eat with

145
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,770
potatoes they're so good for you for

146
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,630

tract and the intestinal tract and

148
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,099
they're so soothing but meanwhile it's

149
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,810
funny they're like hated out there

150
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,419
they're hate and what I always find out

151
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,849
there is they're usually hated by people

152
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,400
in the industry that don't know what

153
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,870
causes chronic illness so it's like wait

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,849
a minute if you don't know what causes

155
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,469
all the different conditions out there

156
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,909
that women are suffering with the

157
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:57,310
fibromyalgia and the chronic fatigue

158
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,469
syndrome and and like rheumatoid

159
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,000
arthritis and the Lyme disease and all

160
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,770
these other things that are now becoming

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,870
mysterious like even Lyme disease is now

162
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,000
a mystery to the industry because it's

163
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,740
autoimmune now they say so with all of

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,449
that it's like and then we're gonna hate

165
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,610
on a potato I've seen people get their

166
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,550

200
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,710
l-lysine in it and l-lysine

201
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,449
is actually what knocks down all of

202
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,949

346
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,430

this heavy-metal detox smoothie

349
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,560
constructed like this and for one is in

350
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,200
order to get a nutrient into our cells

351
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,540
you have it has to be glucose that

352
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,340
drives it into the cell so nutrients

353
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,200
like if we take supplements all day long

354
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,400
and we you know because there's some

355
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,780
great supplements out there and there's

356
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,310
different things or some foods that you

357
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,040
think are nutritious because you're

358
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,890

to be honest I've never felt better

384
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,170
that's because I'm eating healthy and

385
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,210
I'm taking care of myself and you know

386
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,820
I've always said it's about a balance

387
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,630
and I like to have like 80% healthy and

388
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,160
20% indulgent but you've been mentoring

389
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:14,260
me to be more strict with myself which

390
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,100
has definitely been paying off in the

391
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,200

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,330

412
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,200
level of health and wellness and I'm

415
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,960
wouldn't I wouldn't know about it I

416
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,630
would never know just these sweet celery

417
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,339
juice because everybody like mocked that

418
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,110
what they called a vegetable they

419
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,180
thought that things just crudité you

420
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,360
know that it's just chopped you know you

421
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,430
chop that anything yeah you can chop it

422
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,430
up into a salad I guess put a little in

423
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,210
a salad you know you can ya put in a dip

424
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,610
basically so so you know and but it's

425
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,890
like for me it started in 1975 when I

426
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,260
was this little kid and and spirit of

427
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,690
compassion was like this is gonna be an

428
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,250
answer right here for a family member

429
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,870
that had a struggling back problem and

430
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,580
it fixed it and then Wow

431
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,740
and then spirit compassion was like you

432
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,780
know there's just like I remember spirit

433
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,700
compassion trying to convince me because

434
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,069
I was just like you sure I should keep

435
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,600
on recommending celery juice and I was

436
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,310
eight and nine years old and 10 years

437
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,439
old Spears like you know you have to

438
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,179
recommend this because this is going to

439
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,890
be that that that basically that

440
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:18,050
safeguard for people's health like no

441
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,209
other that's ever happened on this plan

442
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,550
it's going to be that that tool that

443
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,980
takes everybody to next level protects

444
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,110
them helps them recover if they're doing

445
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,910
something good for themselves this will

446
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,550
help take them to that next level even

447
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,690
more so and even if they're not doing

448
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,940
anything good for themselves it's gonna

449
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,250
help them yeah if you do it every day

450
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,980
it's an everyday thing I think don't you

451
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,410
think it's important this in every

452
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,800
it's like brushing your teeth it's true

453
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,760
exact on expect to have clean teeth if

454
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,050
you don't brush them it's like yeah

455
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,730
consistency I really feel is important

456
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,230
like and I feel like a lot of people

457
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,120
might go on it for a little bit then

458
00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,010
they go off it but it's really important

459
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,320
to maintain the celery juice one little

460
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,240
thing you can do yeah right it's one you

461
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,160
know it should be like part of your life

462
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,470
you should just like when you're taking

463
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,390
showers exactly this should be in there

464
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,740
just like anything like anything you do

465
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,420
you put gas in your car you're always

466
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,770
gonna put gas through always decelerate

467
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,370
just whatever it is something that you

468
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:23,410
know you always do in your life and

469
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,030
whatever that is but celery juice should

470
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,460
always be a part of it like yeah

471
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:31,480
brushing your teeth like all of that

472
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,040
it's so important and I forgot to remind

473
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,490
everybody if you like this video thumbs

474
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:41,050
do give us a thumbs up but the bottom

475
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,540
line is what celery juice I find all the

476
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,010
time you know miranda is that people

477
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,280
will be like well I tried it for seven

478
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:51,100
days or I did it for 30 days and then I

479
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,650
stopped doing it and I noticed I was

480
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,750
actually feeling better from it so the

481
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,610
stop effect when people actually do it

482
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,440
just long enough and then they stop it

483
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,170
and then they're just like whoa

484
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
something changed I gotta go back on it

485
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,130
but actually it actually reminds you to

486
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,470
go back on it it has an ability to

487
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,390
remind people to go back on it how much

488
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,600

489
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:20,290

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:17,179
high-fat diet well if you're on nut

543
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:19,100
butters nut butters lots of avocados are

544
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,350
good for you it's just that we eat a lot

545
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,630
more of them than we should and that's

546
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,279
what happens and so your nut butters the

547
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,679
avocado you're on all the coconut oil

548
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,480
then you're then maybe you're doing some

549
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,880
dairy maybe you're doing some goat's

550
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,740
milk whatever it could be and or chicken

551
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,110
and so you're doing too many fats

552
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,640
throughout a day and then hey look if

553
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,380
you're not struggling with anything and

554
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,970
you're doing all the fats then your

555
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,380
liver will just kind of hang in there

556
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,429
for a while until it gets sluggish down

557
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,990
the road then you'll get your first

558
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,960
symptoms and then have to lower the fats

559
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,179
but what happens is that the lemon water

560
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,039
is there to flush out those poisons and

561
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,110
toxins that get built up by the liver

562
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,659
ready to deliver into the system ready

563
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,639
to get out so every single night it's

564
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,049
like there's a there's a workshop going

565
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:01,100
on and your liver a bunch of elves are

566
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,639
in there and they're just working on

567
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,769
getting all the

568
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:06,079
without packaging up getting them ready

569
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,700
and then that 32 ounces of lemon water

570
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,989
and it's really important that it's 32

571
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,940
ounces somewhere around there unless you

572
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:14,239

00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:04,039
unbelievable so I'm really blessed that

613
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:05,570
actually survived that event back when I

when your honor I was pregnant with

620
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,120

pregnant the last two pregnancies yeah

622
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,760

well the apples have like electrolytes

626
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,950
it's not like the celery juice

627
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,200
electrolytes but it's really powerful

628
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,250
electrolytes and people underestimate

629
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,870
the apples it's actually plus plus the

630
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,340
thing is they cleanse you the apples are

spirulina it's really a high protein

650
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,580
food but it's also a you know like a

651
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,380
