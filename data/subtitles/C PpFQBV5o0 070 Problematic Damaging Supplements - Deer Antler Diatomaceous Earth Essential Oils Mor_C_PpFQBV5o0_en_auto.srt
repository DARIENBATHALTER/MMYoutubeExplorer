00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,799
creatures colostrum is a really good

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,120
example of that they'll take that away

83
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,519
from the little baby cows the baby

it they'll be dly in any way they can

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,479
out there collagen is a prime example

they remove it from creatures and then

92
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,919
they sell it to a whole bunch of women

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,320
out there that get promised they'll

94
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,840
anti-age by 20 or 30 years another

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,800
example is the black market with whale

96
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,880
meat whale meat is supposed to bring

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,560

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,120
Hearts beef Hearts to big one out there

110
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,360
a lot of people doing beef Hearts that's

111
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,759
another example a prime example of

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,680
eating creatures creature Parts organs

113
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,000
and thinking it's going to fix your

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,919
organs so eating a beef heart will fix

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,400
your

116
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,080
heart it's back to the Dark Ages with

117
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,479
this stuff it's back a thousand years

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,400
ago 800 years ago ago 500 years ago it's

119
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,000
the Dark Ages it's actually

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,000
darkness and the thing is it's an easy

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,680
cell for some reason everybody believes

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,280
it almost almost everybody out there now

123
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,880
medical meme information published info

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,840
about this and how that's not how it

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,520
works like collagen you can't grow

126
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,160
collagen or produce collagen inside your

127
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,639
body by eating collagen it doesn't work

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,479
and now that information's getting

129
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,160
poached and people are talking about

130
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,880
that out there now you can only build

131
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,120
collagen by having building blocks that

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,000
you're eating and

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,800
utilizing you can't fix your eyeball

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,520
problem eating a whole bunch of

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,680
different eyeballs cow eyeballs sheep

136
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,840
eyeballs all sitting inside your gut

137
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,240
putrifying and rotting it's not going to

138
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,800
fix your eye issue but you probably know

139
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,120
this already you probably understand

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,680
that definitely right cuz it only makes

141
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,639
sense but yet so tricky out there it's

142
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,080
easy to fall prey for creature Parts

143
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,680
Dear Antler that's a prime example every

144
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,199
now and then you'll hear something about

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,840
Dear Antler dear velvet and it's like

146
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:54,440
the Panacea once again this will fix you

147
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,759
and people believe it they do and then

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,080
they look for sources of Dear Antler

149
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,919
dear velvet they're looking out there

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,080
and they find different sources like

151
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,599
this stuff is the good stuff kind of

152
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,759
like the CBD thing this is really good

153
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,000
CBD here at this place better than that

154
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,120
CBD we have this in our CBD we have that

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
in our CBD you're looking for the best

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,319
stuff Dear Antler the same thing people

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,800
become connoisseurs they look for it now

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,440
the hormones in Deer Antler do something

159
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,520
that you don't want to do to your body

160
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,840
it's disrupt naturally producing and UR

161
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,240
curring hormones it's disrupting your

162
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,759
hormones so when you do the deer antler

163
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,039
thing you're throwing a monkey wrench

164
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,440
into your hormone

165
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,080
makers so how does the monkey wrench

166
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:50,120
happen What goes wrong well the hormone

167
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,319
compounds in Dear Antler they interfere

168
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:58,080
with yours how they're steroid compounds

169
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,159
steroids do something terrible to our

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,520
hormonal production our adrenals our

171
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,440
glands our endocrine system it

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,440
interferes with it steroids taken long

173
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,560
term can really cause all kinds of human

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,520
growth

175
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,840

hormones and deer antler the steroid

183
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,839
compounds can interfere with that and

184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,599
keep in mind the deer antler thing it's

185
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,680
really a man's thing once again not

186
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,240
looking at women women's needs how their

187
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,399
bodies really work and it's all a trick

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,040
when it comes down to Deer Antler it's a

189
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,080
bunch of guys trying it out playing with

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,120
it seeing how it works if it does or not

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,279
it's like one big experiment and then

192
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,880
women

193
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,640
they're told you should be doing this

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,480
too this is really good for you

195
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,680
meanwhile it's a disaster and deer

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,360
antler steroid compounds can knock the

197
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,800
hair off of women's heads over time can

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,600
create adrenal fatigue can create really

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,600
dry dry skin it's just really not worth

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,320
it it's the definition of snake oil this

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,279
next one pains me and I mean that it

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,440
pains me it slipped through the cacks it

203
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,920

destroyed my life he told me he was

221
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,480
triggered his body started falling apart

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,399
he inhaled the dious Earth and it broke

223
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,600
his immune system down and things just

224
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,240
started to go wrong he was in full body

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,120
pain he was suffering couldn't function

226
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,519
couldn't sleep could barely eat anything

227
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,120
could barely walk all because of the

228
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,600
dious earth he was completely convinced

229
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,920
and positive it was a dious Earth

230
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,040
particles that he inhaled he spent

231
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,360
months trying to get it out of his house

232
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,320
he got rid of his couch he got rid of

233
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,720
all his furniture he vacuumed over and

234
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,880
over and over again and he said well I

235
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,440
had my friend come over and vacuum

236
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,800
because I couldn't even use my arms the

237
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,360
tops of my shoulders hurt so bad that if

238
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,000
I bumped into a wall it floored me he

239
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,360
was stuck in his apartment living there

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,320
saying that he was still breathing it in

241
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,920
he can still smell it it drove him mad

242
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,760
he asked me if I recommend iaus Earth I

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:44,240
said no and I said that s so agrees with

244
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,440
him and I said to him s so agrees with

245
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,320
you on it being a trigger I helped him

246
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,120
with his recovery brought him back to

247
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,079
functioning brought him back to life he

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,200
was able to live his life but he was

249
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,959
injured from it emotionally mentally and

250
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,959
even physically

251
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,240
the dious Earth was a trigger a trigger

252
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,959
lowering his immune system allowing

253
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,399
other things to creep up and take over

254
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,760
and this isn't the only time I've seen

255
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,040
it happen dious Earth should not be

256
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,639
eaten and it shouldn't be used for

257
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,320
anything it agitates and clings to the

258
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,320
intestinal Linings it doesn't leave the

259
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,600
intestinal tract quickly it's

260
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,959
abrasive it creates a problem with

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,800
sensitive nerves it's a trigger for all

262
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,800
around anything it's just a menace and

263
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,120
when it's

264
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,399
inhaled it lowers the immune system it

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,199
confuses the immune system white blood

266
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,480
cells see dious Earth as foreign

267
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:51,160
Invaders and when the immune system

268
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,760
drops because dious Earth is lowering

269
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,320
the immune system when you're breathing

270
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,279
it in then anything in the body can rise

271
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,959
up Invaders that live with people

272
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:06,079
stealth vir es come out of dormy Epstein

273
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:09,120
bar shingles hhv6 herpes simplex one can

274
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,880
all of a sudden get a leg up and still

275
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,079
to this day when I see dious Earth in

276
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,560
health and beauty and all kinds of

277
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,279
different Health stuff food supplements

278
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I scratch my head and I go nobody gets

279
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,800
it this next one digestive bitters is

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,120
kind of funny because really it's

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,360
useless every now and then you'll see

282
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,040
out there an influencer be like I'm

283
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,199
using these digestive bitters I'm using

284
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,519
Bitters and they're all into it like

285
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,160
here's bitters my practitioner gave me

286
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,199
these bitters or I got them here online

287
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,279
from this place and when they do that

288
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,760
what's really happening is they're just

289
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,320
drinking basically they're taking shots

290
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,360
of alcohol they're drinking bitters have

291
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,600
always had alcohol in it they've always

292
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,279
had alcohol in it corn grain alcohol now

293
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,839
in the earlier days it would be bourbon

294
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:09,440
whiskey rum it would be vodka it would

295
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:13,399
be another type of alcohol in there but

296
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,320
now it's shifting so now it's shifting

297
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,759
to something different set of corn grain

298
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,440
alcohol or some other variety of alcohol

299
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,839
they're doing glycerin and they're

300
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,839
usually doing a blend now be like

301
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,759
glycerin and alcohol because let's face

302
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,560
it they're drinking bitters because of

303
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,800
the alcohol people don't know it but

304
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,600
they get addicted to it helps them sleep

305
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,160
at night they're basically having a shot

306
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,880
of alcohol before bed but it's shifting

307
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,000
because of medical medium

308
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,800
information all the years letting people

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,320
know that alcohol destroys the

310
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,480
phytochemical compounds the medicine the

311
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,759
nutrients herbal tinctures with alcohol

312
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,279
in them makes them ineffective bottom

313
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,079
line so now that system out there that

314
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,680
was built on alcohol and all the

315
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,320
tinctures and the bids is Shifting and

316
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,800
changing so now bids they'll have

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,000
they'll be split they'll be glycerin and

318
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,120
alcohol tinctures now too glycerin and

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,560
alcohol and there's even bitters out

320
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,920
there now that are just glycerin now

321
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,000
truly in order for a bitter to be called

322
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,120
a bitter and a bitter to be a bitter

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,560
alcohol has to be there so when someone

324
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:34,839
purchases a bidder now they purchasing a

325
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,720
fraud a fraud bidder it's missing the

326
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,959
alcohol now it's just an herbal tincture

327
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,079
with glycerin in it that's all it is now

328
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,399
it's not a bitter anymore has to have

329
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,279
the alcohol in it to become a bitter and

330
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,680
Bitters with glycerin without the

331
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,639
alcohol have all these natural flavors

332
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,240
in them now so if you buy a bitter it

333
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,959
may not have the alcohol it's not a

334
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,600
bitter anymore it's a fraud then it has

335
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,240
the glycerin so now it's just a tincture

336
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,079
with glycerin an herbal tincture but

337
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,079
worse it's an herbal tincture with a bad

338
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,040
glycerin not even a good glycerin and

339
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,800
then it's got all kinds of different

340
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,800
flavorings and citric acid and all kinds

341
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,920
of other stuff in there Bitters and

342
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,000
digestive bitters are essentially

343
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,560
useless and when it comes down to

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,240
alcohol it's bad bad bad there's no good

345
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,759
good good in any of it it's bad and what

346
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,560
happens is that alcohol was taboo over

347
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
the years and medical medium information

348
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
talked about it being bad all the

349
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,480
different podcast doctors and health

350
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,639
authors and everybody in the last just

351
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,240
couple decades always recreationally

352
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,959
drank they drank they had martinis they

353
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,319
had wine everybody laid off the subject

354
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,959
nobody said that alcohol was bad nobody

355
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:57,160
said wine or alcohol or any kind of

356
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,519
alcoholic beverage was bad medical

357
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,440
medium information said no no know it's

358
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,520
bad for the brain it'll rot your brain

359
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,520
we have all the information Spirit and I

360
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,400
it's in the books brainsaver book is one

361
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,919
example right there and so everybody

362
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,319
thinks alcohol was okay and just keep it

363
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,720
at that no one wanted to even approach

364
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,720
it it was just like hands off hands off

365
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,199
now you see out there you see different

408
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,600
essential oils aren't a great thing sure

409
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:09,760
if you smell them a little bit maybe

410
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,679
it's thinned out and put into an oil and

411
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,280
you use it as a little type of body

412
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,320
lotion or something and even there

413
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,039
that's fine but if you're somebody

414
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,440
really hypers sensitive and you're told

415
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,600
to ingest them digest them ingest them

416
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,440
drink them eat them take them internally

417
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,120
that's where it goes all wrong a lot of

418
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,679
people are living with sensitive vagus

419
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,679
nerves they're spasming they're

420
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
inflamed they're causing problems in

421
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,720
their intestinal tract they're causing

422
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,880
problems in how they feel overall

423
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,840
they're giving them fatigue they're

424
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,919
giving them all kinds of different ticks

425
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,840
and spasms and then you drink or eat an

426
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,320
essential oil like a therapy some kind

427
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,000
of therapeutic way where someone's like

428
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,640
yes do these essential oils take them

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,679
internally drink them on a regular basis

430
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,880
therapeutically weekly every day twice a

431
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,440
day and then you flare the nerves up

432
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,960
they go on fire they light up and

433
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,120
symptoms actually get Advanced versus

434
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,679
Retreat and essential oils can make

435
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,400
nerves hypers sensitive like OV excite

436
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,400
them your senses they can be over

437
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,799
excited by them especially when you're

438
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,000
somebody that's really sensitive where

439
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,559
it gets into the sinuses and it's in

440
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,400
there deep and it's actually exciting

441
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,320
the nerves if someone's inflamed and

442
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,559
they got inflamed cranial nerves this

443
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,200
could be an

444
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,640
overload now whenever I utter this stuff

445
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
out about essential oils people just

446
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,440
start throwing stones and

447
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,640
pitchforks torches all come out people

448
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,120
do not like hearing this first thing you

449
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,799
hear is not my Essential Oils not the

450
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,080
ones I use this is the best of the best

451
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,919
they extract it from the bark of a

452
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,039
Amazon Tree it's handcrafted it's put in

453
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,480
the bottle just right nothing's added in

454
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,840
it and that's different and I use them

455
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,799
for healing and my therapy and

456
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,360
everything else and my client's therapy

457
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,120
and all this other stuff and you hear

458
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,720
this stuff and I'm like okay okay I get

459
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,840
it I'm listen I'm talking about chronic

460
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,240
illness here I'm talking about people

461
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,240
with central nervous systems that are on

462
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,600
fire they're already on fire from all

463
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,679
kinds of viruses and they got

464
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,840
neurological lime and multiple sclerosis

465
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,039
or just a host of symptoms no one under

466
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,480
understands mystery symptoms they're

467
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,720
already suffering they're already

468
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,520
struggling and when you ingest these

469
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,240
when you actually take these in

470
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,080
internally it could literally stir the

471
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,320
pot I've seen it it

472
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,679
happens and I'm just saying taken

473
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,840
internally drinking them eating them

474
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,279
ingesting them that's the bad part

475
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,279
that's the part that's risky that's the

476
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,640
part where people are telling everybody

477
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,760
at the time especially during the

478
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,799
explosion the essential oil explosion

479
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,679
when everybody was like a dealer an

480
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,720
essential oil dealer and all of social

481
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,400
media was taken over by essential oil

482
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,480
salese well they'll just be like drink

483
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,000
it um use it in your enema um use it in

484
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,320
your ears I mean people were just

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,720
screaming to use it in any way possible

486
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,840
but when it comes down to The Chronic

487
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,279
Leo they were getting injured left and

488
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,840
right I'm not anti- essential oil that's

489
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,400
not what this is I'm not anti- essential

490
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,640
oil if it's in some type of Body

491
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,760
ointment and you got to be careful there

492
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,840
too something will say it has essential

493
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,120
oils in it but yet it still has perfume

494
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,039
and perfume with an essential oil a lot

495
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,240
of products say they have essential oils

496
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
in it or it's essential oil when it's a

497
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,240
mixed bag of nuts it'll have a whole

498
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,880
bunch of different fragrances mixed with

499
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,679
essential oil and once again I'm not

500
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,480
anti- essential oil I see the value in

501
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:00,760
it it does hold value especially high

502
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,400
quality essential oil oils but ingesting

503
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,919
them and taking them internally is risky

504
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,840
especially when you have a sensitive

505
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,679
central nervous system and so many

506
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,520
people with chronic illness really

507
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,440
struggle with that another thing about

508
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,240
essential oils that isn't a great thing

509
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,520
is people use them in a way that gets

510
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,159
oil all over the house they put it in

511
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,440
the laundry gets on the couches they

512
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,799
have it on their arms and Body in the

513
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,440
sense where they're wet they're wetting

514
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,640
themselves down down with essential oils

515
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,000
and they're being told to so they got it

516
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,919
all over them they lean against the wall

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,720
they rub it on the wall they put it on

518
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,400
the kitchen counters they clean with it

519
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,360
they're diffusing it all day in their

520
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,799
house so it's clinging to everything

521
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,039
clinging to the walls they're actually

522
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,919
using it when they go to bed at night

523
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,640
it's rubbed in their sheets it's on

524
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,279
their pillows and remember it's in oil

525
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,600
and it's usually in carriers when

526
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,520
they're rubbing it on their bodies so

527
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,520
what's happening is that oil is getting

528
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,799
everywhere and then when that oils on

529
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,679
the couch and it's on the blankets and

530
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,840
it's on the furniture food particles end

531
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,120
up landing on it dander ends up landing

532
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,320
on it it collects it collects stuff it

533
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,200
collects dust the oil collects dust it

534
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,360
goes into the oil when it's just

535
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,919
floating around the house and then over

536
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,320
time mold starts to grow and everybody's

537
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,600
worried about mold everybody's freaking

538
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,559
out about mold essential oil s can bring

539
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,679
mold it doesn't mean the actual medicine

540
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,080
extraction in the essential oil or of

541
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,200
the essential oil or the essential oil

542
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,600
is the worst thing as far as mold

543
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,279
creating it's just when it gets away

544
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,080
from us when it's on everything when

545
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,000
it's on the blankets then you wash the

546
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,480
blanket but it doesn't all come out

547
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,799
everything just starts to stay damp oil

548
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,320
dampness that's what it's called and

549
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,520
what happens is that oil damp is on

550
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,640
everything it's in the carpet it's on

551
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,600
the floor it's on the hardwood floor

552
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,720
it's on the tables it's on the curtains

553
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,159
it's everywhere and oil dampness

554
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,360
collects mold now it doesn't mean you

555
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,520
can't use a diffuser it's just that

556
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,799
people overdo it they do it where

557
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,840
they're not even diluting it it's

558
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,480
straight lots of oil going in everywhere

559
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,279
and it's on their skin it's on their

560
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,279
body it's on their clothes they're

561
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,640
sitting on furniture it's everywhere

562
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,279
it's not controlled it's not balanced so

563
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,440
diffusers fine you could use diffusers

564
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,440
to put some Rosemary in there and try to

565
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,279
keep mold down but if there's oils

566
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,080
everywhere including the carriers

567
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,480
everywhere all around the house on

568
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
everything it gets out of control and it

569
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,960
changes the

570
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,520
balance keep in mind this is light ears

571
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,080
from the synthetic oilbased air

572
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,960
fresheners the plugins that people have

573
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,320
every day out there that are admitting

574
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,039
this disgusting oil filled with

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,159
chemicals and it's just leeching

576
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,960
everywhere and landing on everything

577
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,240
this is different but still it creates a

578
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,399
dampness and oil dampness and brings

579
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,320
about mold over time there are many more

580
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,080
problematic and damaging supplements to

581
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,799
talk about and we're going to get

582
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,320

antlers once again

602
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,760
fold by another experimental game and

603
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,760
Trend that makes someone who's unwell

604
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,159
feel like like it's a win but it ain't

605
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,480
and it comes with hidden unforeseen

606
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:42,039
pain so easily

607
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,760
tricked time and time again I think it's

00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,200

616
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:17,600
