bit we're going to make a healing broth

112
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480

the damage

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,360
charcoal caused my intestinal tract

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
kimberly miller

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
um thanks for um telling everybody and

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
and telling us it's important because

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,319
the charcoal can really do damage and so

121
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,120
we're taught like do the charcoal do the

122
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,280
charcoal

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
internally right swallow the activated

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
charcoal

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
but people don't realize that it

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,759
suffocates the lining of your gut

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
so you don't get absorption so you don't

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
absorb the things you need to absorb all

129
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,280
the nutrients

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,320
it it is so it's so evasive

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,639
to the intestinal lining charcoal

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,919
i've never recommended anybody to

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,680
swallow charcoal

134
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,880
never never never i've been consistent

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
not contradicting through the years

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
and you see that out there and i know

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,720
you guys right you heard me say this

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
before

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
but it's like all the podcast doctors

140
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,759
you should have seen what they were

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
doing

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
10 years ago seeing what they're doing

143
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,440
eight years ago six years ago it's like

144
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,120
a countdown let's change it up again

145
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,040
five years ago four years ago they

146
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
changed their tune no one knows how to

147
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
do anything no one knows how to fix

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
anybody

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,479
oh now we're down to three now they're

150
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
down to two years ago and now all of a

151
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,600
sudden they're picking up medical medium

152
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,479
information left and right

153
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
adding it to charcoal but you don't want

154
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
to do the charcoal it's really really

155
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
aggressive

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,400
on the system keep that in mind

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
so here's the thing we're coming to a

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,759
place where

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
there's going to be a lot of instigators

160
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
death by a thousand cuts and one of the

161
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
death

162
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,479

and i get it it's like we're excited

191
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,880
about packages when they arrive totally

192
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759

193
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
taught

194
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
we take the packages and we put it on

195
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,880
our kitchen counter

196
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
there's grease on the bottom of all the

197
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
packages there's

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,560
all kinds of pathogens on packages right

199
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,600
and it's not about being scared

200
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,199
it's not about being afraid

201
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
or in fear it's about having your back

202
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,199
the information counts wouldn't you love

203
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,199

technically be the flu it should not

210
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
exist

211
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
it would go through everybody and then

212
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,639
completely

213
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:16,720
die out if it wasn't brought back

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,680
and released again into the world

215
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
just so you know okay the flu virus

216
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,440
would not

217
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
exist it would just die out

218
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,560
we would never have the flu again no one

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,120
would be passing the flu around

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
no one would be passing around any kind

221
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
of flu variety

222
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
plague flu variety around no one would

223
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
be passing any of those around

224
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
they would run their course and die

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,039
that's all

226
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
that's it the bug would run its course

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
and die but

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360

337
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,920
they don't listen

338

yeah i know i know um

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,360
women already are struggling with

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,360
autoimmune at a rate that's unbelievable

341
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
unprecedented you guys

342
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
women already struggling with

343
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,920
so many different conditions and

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,680
symptoms worldwide

345
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,880
it's it's unbelievable you know

346
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,440
but let's teach women

347
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,040
to put air fresheners in the car let's

348
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,079
teach them that they have to constantly

349
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
be smelling some kind of chemical

350
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
that's that's the way it's rigged out

351
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
there

352
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
meanwhile what's happening whether you

353
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,399
believe it or not

354
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
you can just be like you know what he

355
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,200
this isn't true

356
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,279
i could breathe in my air fresheners all

357
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
i want in my car that's not going to

358
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
knock my immune system

359
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
down go think what you want it's

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,560
knocking your immune system down

361
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,920
okay and immune systems already function

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,440
they already fluctuate

363
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,040
for women they're already fluctuating

364
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
women have a reproductive system

365
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,200
different than men

366
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
so women's immune systems drop

367
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
dramatically

368
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,360
during menstruation ovulation being

369
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,959
pregnant too

370
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
the immune system is already dropping

371
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,200
well it doesn't happen for men like that

372
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
and so women alright are already

373
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,760
struggling

374
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,040
with immune system conditions symptoms

375
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
or immune systems are

376
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,519
already compromised because of the

377
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,680
reproductive system

378
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
but but how is that possible think about

379
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,120
this okay think about this

380
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,720
well anthony that's not how it works

381
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,240
think about it if it's

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,519
if it's natural if we're here on

383
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,560
earth why would women be given this

384
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,560
immune system drop during their

385
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
menstruation during their cycle where 80

386
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
percent of their immune system goes to

387
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
the reproductive system only 20 percent

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
of

389
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
their immune system is left to protect

390
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,760
them

391
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
why is it that this thing this wouldn't

392
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,839
happen

393
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
right if you don't believe that god put

394
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
us here

395
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,320
if you don't believe that god put human

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,760
beings that that

397
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
life is here because of god or if you

398
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,920
if you believe life is here because of

399
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,560
god anthony

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,639
god wouldn't do that why would god put

401
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,000
us here on this earth and put women on

402
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
this earth and have them have immune

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
system problems when they have their

404
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,839
cycle and ovulation and everything else

405
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
or say you don't believe god put human

406
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,519
beings here

407
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,160
you know say you believe that we we came

408
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,720
from

409
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,560
uh we came from a little sea creature

410
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
and we crawled out of the ocean as a

411
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
little sea creature

412
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,600
and we went and then another million

413
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
years went by and we started trying to

414
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
breathe

415
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,920
out of the water another million years

416
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,199
went by and we became like a badger and

417
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,959
now we're a different creature

418
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,800
another million years by we became a

419
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,320
monkey right and now we're a gorilla

420
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
right and now we're a human being say

421
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,040
you believe in evolution

422
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,760
right say you're somebody that believes

423
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
in evolution

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
why would we evolve in a way where

425
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,000
women's immune systems would

426
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,360
would tank during menstruation and

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,199
ovulation where 40

428
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,360
of their immune system goes down during

429
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,760
ovulation

430
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
you know or say you believe you don't

431
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
believe in having

432
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
evolution and you don't believe god put

433
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,160
us here

434
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
right and you believe an alien

435
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,600
spacecraft

436
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,519
okay bye and just put us all down here

437
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,040

they believe in that too okay whatever

440
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,560
you believe in right

441
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,199
say we say we got here that way why

442
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,360
would that alien spacecraft

443
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
say hey women haha this is a cruel joke

444
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
their immune system

445
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,160
the aliens are up there saying your

446
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,440
immune systems are gonna drop

447
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
80 percent when they have their

448
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
menstruation it's like hahaha this is a

449
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
fun joke played on all those women down

450
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,519
there

451
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,279
watch how hard they have it

452
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,880
say you believe in that either way

453
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:06,480
here's how it works what we didn't have

454
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,199
millions of years ago were pathogens

455
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
that we have now what we didn't even

456
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,079
have

457
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
300 years ago are pathogens that we have

458
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,399
now what we didn't even have

459
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,040
a hundred years ago you guys 150 years

460
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,079
ago

461
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,320
are pathogens we have now

462
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,839
we got the epstein bars they've evolved

463
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
those epson words you know what has

464
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
evolved not

465
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,040
us not us

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,839
we didn't evolve no

467
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,120
maybe spiritually maybe you evolved

468
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
spiritually

469
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,560
maybe you took a yolk course in a

470
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240
spiritual class and you know

471
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,560
went up on a mountaintop with a few

472
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,320
friends and camped out and

473
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
talked about the stars maybe you evolved

474
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
spiritually

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,519
maybe you did meditations every single

476
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
day you evolved spiritually

477
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
maybe you had i always say we evolve

478
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,320
spiritually

479
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,759
when something hits us and we're like on

480
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
our hands and knees

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,440
notes

568
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,679
seriously the most important one of

569
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,919
these important notes is

570
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
we didn't evolve physically we don't

571
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,559
evolve physically here

572
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,559
as time goes on

573
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,480
but everything around us that wants to

574
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,640
take us down

575
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
evolves the chemical companies evolve

576
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,240
how about that how about them

577
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,280
apples you guys how about them apples

578
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,840
chemical companies they evolve they make

579
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,520
a new batch of crap every single day

580
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,120
they got scientists right in their labs

581
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
playing around with chemicals we're

582
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
going to put this in this fabric

583
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,799
softener

584
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
who cares what it does to people's

585
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,679
brains who cares what does their

586
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,840
children

587
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
let's as long as they feel nice and safe

588
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
with their fabric softener and they like

589
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
the smell

590
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,520
then who cares what happens to their

591
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
family the chemical companies they

592
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,960
evolve

593
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,000
right what else evolves

594
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,159
okay not just the pesticide companies

595
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,440
they evolve

596
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,720
they'll come out with another 100

597
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,799
brews of skull and crossbones

598
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,240
skull and crossbones put some celery in

599
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,640
this

600
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,200
just put some onion in there it's going

601
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,960
skull and crossbones

602
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
that's what's on the pesticide

603
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
containers

604
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,039
herbicides herbicides are a big one

605
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,200
right there those herbicides

606
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:50,799
they evolve what else evolves

607
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,400
right nanotechnology that evolves

608
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,480
how about that right how about emf

609
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,000
that evolves we don't evolve physically

610
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,880
emf does okay

611
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
that's what evolves right chemical

612
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
company stuff evolves you know what else

613
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,640
evolves

614
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:15,520
gmo evolves gmo now they've got

615
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,039
a thousand varieties of gmo corn in

616
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,240
hawaii

617
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,679

island

621
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,919

622
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
they've destroyed hawaii no one's doing

623
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,720
anything about it

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
hippies and they're like which is

627
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
totally cool and they're like

628
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
they're like yeah we're doing we're

629
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,919
doing a protest against this and this

630
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,440
and this and this

631
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,440
and they're they're in hawaii and i'm

632
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
like really really why don't you guys

633
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,760
protest against

634
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,200
the fact that they've taken over hawaii

635
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,559
with gmo crops medical corn grain

636
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,360
crops big pharma owns hawaii

637
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,480
hawaii was sold to big pharma it was

638
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,960
sold to big pharma

639
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,360
they're just growing non-stop gmo crops

640
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
it's gmo central

641
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
it's like there's a watch it moved to

642
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
hawaii it's so great what are you

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
talking about the edge of the water it's

644
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,720
so great by the ocean

645
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,559
other than that they thought it's just

646
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,320
gmo

647
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,280
it because that's evolved so gmo evolves

648
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,039
you guys

649
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,480
clubhouse evolves and all this evolves

650
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,080
you know what else evolves the tech

651
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,960
companies

652
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,799
they evolve now you're now your tech

653
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,480
devices do this now your tech devices do

654
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,600
that now they radiate more radiation now

655
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,280
there's more radiation

656
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
they evolve so we get all the radiation

657
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
from our tech right

658
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,320
i'm not trying to say we got to be

659
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,679
afraid of our tech freight of the

660
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
chemical companies afraid of this

661
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,240
afraid of that afraid of gmo food if we

662
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
get exposed we get exposed but what i'm

663
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480
saying

664
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
is we got to keep our immune system

665
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
strong we got to build our immune system

666
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,159
we got to make it happen

667
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,760
we got to take care of ourselves right

668
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,480
it's important

669
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,360
that's what i'm saying so i'm putting in

670
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,520
some carrots

671
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,279
i put in some celery right there i'm

672
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,000
going to chop up some parsley right now

673
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
for this soup

674
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
right

675
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,320
doing some finely chopped parsley right

676
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,880
here

677
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,640
nice parsley in this this is gonna be a

678
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,919
great broth this is the healing broth i

679
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,080
love it

680
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,320
let's put a bulb of garlic in here to

681
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,840
you guys

682
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,919
got it heating up so

683
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
what we have to do you know where we

684
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,520
have to evolve

685
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,720
we have to evolve in the fight

686
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,559
against all of that right

687
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,279
protect your immune systems get it ready

688
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,279
for battle

689
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,000
that's what we have to do but you know

690
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
what

691
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
how does this stuff break down your

692
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,120
immune system did you ever wonder

693
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
or is it interesting to know now did you

694
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,039
ever wonder

695
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,880
how how does a chemical how does a

696
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,520
fabric softener break down your immune

697
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
system

698
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,120
how does a perfume a clone break down

699
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,440
your immune system because it's

700
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,600
foreign chemicals untested

701
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,520
no long-term testing serious

702
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,400
ramifications

703
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:43,360
never discovered because it's not been

704
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,960
tested long enough

705
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
put some garlic in here let's chop the

706
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,679
garlic up

707
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
how does it break down the immune system

708
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,840
our body

709
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,200
is allergic even if you don't react to

710
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,760
all of these things

711
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,480
and our white count knows it so our

712
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
white count

713
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,360
gobbles it up you want to keep your you

714
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,480
want to keep your immune system busy

715
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,400
right oh exposure's good for you you

716
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,720
should get all that exposure it's so

717
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,080
healthy for you makes you stronger what

718
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,279
doesn't kill you makes you stronger

719
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,279
what bs that is

720
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,840
you know talking to a friend of mine

721
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
and

722
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,320
their uncle was in the gulf war

723
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,400
and got exposed to a lot of stuff

724
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,559
got injured did it make them stronger

725
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
no

726
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,679
when somebody strokes out from a

727
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,720
medication does it make them stronger

728
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,720
because i'm confused

729
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,480
someone someone i'm scratching my head

730
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
here i'm scratching my head

731
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,880
someone gets a blood blood clot someone

732
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,000
gets a blood clot from a medication

733
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,200
from the pill

734
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
note a lot of women they got a blood

735
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,039
clot from the pill um

736
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,360
did it make them stronger no they've

737
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,559
been

738
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,880
they've been knocked down from it

739
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,600
the rest of their life um

740
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,679
what else what else lots of lots of

741
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,480
harsh harsh antibiotics for lyme disease

742
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,799
treatment

743
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,039
did that make them what didn't kill him

744
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,080
made him stronger no

that

779
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,840
you don't know that right nobody knew

780
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,559
that perfume was

781
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,679
a toxic chemical right about a barrage

782
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
of toxic chemicals

783
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,559
medical medium information was the first

784
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:21,120
to come out um exposing that right

785
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,720
but guess guess who knows about that

786
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
toxic chemical your white blood count

787
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,080
right there

788
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
put a name on your white blood cells

789
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,960
what do you want to name your white

790
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,320
blood cell

791
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,080
yeah and yeah well whatever

792
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,039
whatever you want to name your white

793
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,159
blood cell right

794
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,679
your white blood cell is aware has an

795
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,960
intelligence

796
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,880
and knows that that perfume that cologne

797
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,000
is highly toxic you breathe it in

798
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,440
your white cat has to eat it has to eat

799
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,679
it

800
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:01,120
see that's how it works

801
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,240
gobble it up every little

802
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,880
particle that goes in you your white

803
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,279
count has to gobble it up

804
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
right you get exposed to toxic heavy

805
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,520
metals

806
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:18,080
your white count has to gobble it up

807
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,080
right that's how it's done right

808
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:26,799
and then it weakens your white count

809
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:29,279
weakens your white count until it dies

810
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,399
isn't it interesting you're still alive

811
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,320
looking around you're

812
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,320
doing your thing and your one count is

813
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,840
dying poof one died

814
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,480
that's it no boom another one died

815
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,480
another one died okay over time it's

816
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
okay my bone marrow can produce a whole

817
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
ton of it

818
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,120
oh oh my bone marrow can produce tons

819
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,919
and tons of it keep on sending them out

820
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,159
boom die

821
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,760
boom die boom that one dies that one

822
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,799
dies

823
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,799
your white count gobbles these things up

824
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
it gobbles all those poisons and toxins

825
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,760

podcast i got the chemtrail episode okay

910
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,559

911
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,480
right

912
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
every day all around all around the

913
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,480
planet

914
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,320
it's an unbelievable

915
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,679

on us and it's not about living in fear

921
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,960
it's just about how do we protect

922
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
ourselves right

923
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,800
so what do we do do we stay in denial

924
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
and never protect ourselves

925
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,879
do you you know what let's not i guess

926
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,399

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,720
things we don't want to know the truth

928
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,839
right

929
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,839
is that what it is we want to be in

930
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,760

931
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,480
what reality is

932
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,879
we just want to just pretend you know

933
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,800

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
feel

944
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,920
incredible anxiety that's so it's

945
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,760
insurmountable

946
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,000
what are you doing dealing with oh your

947
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,119
leg hurts you can't even walk what else

948
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
is going on your

949
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,960
your back is killing you what you have

950
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,079
fatigue you have severe brain fog

951
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,119
let's just it's not happening right it's

952
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
not happening

953
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,960
it's not real right we're not really

954
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
sick you know what you know what i love

955
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,079
that whole denial thing

956
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
is the game that's thrown on the chronic

957
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,359
allele that's really its madness

958
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,119
you're not sick you're making it up

959
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,640
you're faking it you're making it up

960
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
you're faking it you're faking it till

961
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,839
you make it

962
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
whatever they say andrea says we can't

963
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,800
say no

964
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,359
and choose differently if we aren't

965
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,760
aware of what is really going on

966
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,119
we need to know how people are hurting

967
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,280
us so we can have

968
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:04,320
boundaries andrea wise words

969
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,680
wise words so your

970
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,680
white blood cells okay

971
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,359
they're there gobbling up left and right

972
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,520
everything we're exposed to

973
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,119
that's how it works everything we're

974
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,599
exposed to

975
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,359
our white blood cells are gobbling it up

976
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,359
and then the pathogens

977
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,000
right so we already have enough going on

978
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,400
in the pathogens we get exposed to

979
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,240
right we get exposed to the flu we get

980
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,240
exposed to the plague we get exposed to

981
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,760
those types of flus hybridized blues

982
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,520
we get exposed and

983
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,839
when we get exposed it knocks us down

984
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,320
another level so it's all this exposure

985
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,000
so our white blood cells are really busy

986
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,839
they're they're eating all this they're

987
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,119
they're feeding on all this

988
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,359
they're there eating it up but we lose

989
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
our

990
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,880
white count and when we lose our white

991
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,320
count to all these exposures

992
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,680
more is produced but there's a gap

993
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,240
you guys there's a gap everybody seems

994
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,000
to think

995
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
you lose your white blood cells after

996
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,040
they draw blood from you or something

997
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,800
like that like i talk about medical mean

998
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,320
podcast at apple podcast the blood draw

999
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,280
episode you've got to listen to some day

1000
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,440
you guys

1001
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
people think that when you remove blood

1002
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,680
your bone marrow will just replenish it

1003
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,520
all your

1004
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,599
immune systems will be all back there

1005
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,240
nice and happy everything's back and all

1006
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,560
good

1007
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,480
no there's a gap in between and when we

1008
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,440
get our blood drawn that gap can run

1009
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
three to six weeks

1010
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,960
two to four months three to six months

1011
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,320
for a lot of different people

1012
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,200
and but even if we're up against poisons

1013
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,000
and toxins

1014
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,520
chemicals fabric softeners detergents

1015
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
chemical household cleaners with

1016
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
chemicals

1017
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,480
in them right conventional ones even

1018
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,760
natural ones some of them are really got

1019
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,400
toxic things in it

1020
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,839
so whatever we're up against not as much

1021
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,040
toxic of course but when we're up

1022
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,520
against these things

1023
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,400
our immune system's dying when it gets

1024
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,200
overloaded it when it gets overloaded it

1025
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
dies

1026
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,359
so the white blood cell gobbles another

1027
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,040
toxic substance and it dies

1028
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,119
it gobbles another another white blood

1029
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,800
cell gobbles another toxic substance

1030
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,320
another toxic substance until it's

1031
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
overloaded and it dies and then there's

1032
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,160
a gap

1033
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,599
our bone marrow doesn't keep track at

1034
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,280
those numbers

1035
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,920
it only keeps track when you're hit hard

1036
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,800
like slammed like your blood is drawn

1037
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,079
from you

1038
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
like getting your blood test at the

1039
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,520
doctor's office and they take too many

1040
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,040
vials four vials five vials six vials

1041
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,920
eight vials 14 vials

1042
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,320
that's when our bone marrow says whoa we

1043
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
just

1044
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,560
was something happened right there right

1045
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
but all the little stuff the chemical

1046
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,079
stuff falling out of the sky the toxic

1047
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,440
heavy metals were exposed to

1048
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,359
all the different little bugs were

1049
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,000
exposed to everything that your white

1050
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,880
town is

1051
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,720
eating up your your your bone arrow is

1052
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,920
not keeping track so easily of all that

1053
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,599
and there's these gaps

1054
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,200
and then we run around with this lowered

1055
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,280
immune system

1056
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,240
we run around with this immune system

1057
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,040
that's lower

1058
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,880
and then women women have a harder time

1059
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,839
their immune system's already

1060
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,920
fluctuating so much it's fluctuating

1061
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,040
during the cycles it's fluctuating

1062
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,560
during pregnancy it's fluctuating during

1063
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,040
ovulation

1064
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,720
and that fluctuation makes it so that

1065
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,240
we're up women are up against

1066
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,079
all these other chemical toxins and

1067
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,160
poisons they're up against these

1068
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,119
pathogens floating around

1069
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,119
and then they're hit harder this is why

1070
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,680
women are suffering with chronic illness

1071
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,000
more than ever before more than men and

1072
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,280
more than ever before in our history but

1073
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,200
the tide's going to change the tide's

1074
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,359
going to change

1075
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,000
you're going to see more men sicker than

1076
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,040
ever before in our history coming up

1077
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,480
and the next from now today

1078
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,599
to the next five years and this fall

1079
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,200
coming up after the summer

1080
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,480
okay we get towards the end of this year

1081
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,040
right when we're towards the end this

1082
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,079
year there's going to be a lot of

1083
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,520
problems

1084
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,200
there's going to be a lot of different

1085
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,240
flu bugs going around there's going to

1086
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,079
be a lot of different plate

1087
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,400
hybridization flu plugs

1088
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,760
bugs going around there's going to be a

1089
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,960
lot of that

1090
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,560
and there's also going to be weaker

1091
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
immune systems than we've ever had

1092
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,440
before

1093
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,520
by the end of this year and we're going

1094
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,839
to all have that too

1095
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,520
and then media is not going to cover it

1096
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,520
but people are going to be in sicker

1097
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,000
and sicker and sicker and sicker

1098
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,720
but we don't have to do that we don't

1099
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
have to

1100
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,839
be that way we can protect ourselves if

1101
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,359
we can learn how to do it i'm making

1102
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,280
medical medium heavy metal

1103
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,520
detox smoothies every day for myself i'm

1104
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
making a medical medium to celery juice

1105
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
i'm drinking every day for myself right

1106
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,800
what are you guys doing

1107
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,760
i'm doing the vitamin c shock therapy

1108
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,520
we're talking about the

1109
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,119
zinc shock therapy right i'll talk about

1110
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,079
that a little bit too and the vitamin c

1111
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,520
shock therapy doing the medical medium

1112
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,480
healing broth right now

1113
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,119
the thyme tea right ginger water i'm

1114
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,160
doing with

1115
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,800
these things are giving us a chance

1116
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,720
right these things give us a chance to

1117
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,440
keep our immune system strong

1118
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,920
so that the white blood cells don't die

1119
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,920
easy

1120
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,520
yeah when you give your white blood

1121
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,720
cells things

1122
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,280
they don't die as easy see

1123
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,920
isn't that incredible white blood cells

1124
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,920
are hungry

1125
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
they need fuel so they need trace

1126
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,400
mineral salts they need

1127
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,359
zinc your white blood cells need zinc

1128
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,960
right

1129
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,040
and when they when your white blood

1130
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,680
cells need vitamin c

1131
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
who's feeding their white blood cells

1132
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
enough

1133
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,000
to battle what we're up against the

1134
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,920
white blood cells

1135
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,960
need the healing minerals that are in

1136
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,680
the medical medium healing broth

1137
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,680
so important

1138
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,960
so elite maha says i was told that

1139
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,440
giving blood

1140
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,119
is healthy for us because it takes

1141
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
toxicity out

1142
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,280
look no disrespect seriously and i'm

1143
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,119
glad you're here okay

1144
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,400
i'm glad you're here elite my house i'm

1145
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,960
really glad okay

1146
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,960
because um that's a really good question

1147
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,920
it's not how it works

1148
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
because when we remove blood we remove a

1149
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,079
large part of our immune system and that

1150
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,560
part of our immune system is keeping us

1151
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,319
stable and so what happens is if you're

1152
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,760
somebody with cfs if you're somebody

1153
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,000
with fibromyalgia if you're somebody

1154
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,079
with

1155
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,440
anything sibo if you're somebody with

1156
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,800
plantar fasciitis

1157
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,040
eczema psoriasis lupus r a

1158
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,119
brain fog whatever you got going on

1159
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,680
headaches migraines burning skin tingles

1160
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,079
numbness

1161
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,599
ringing the ears whatever it is the more

1162
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,000
blood you remove

1163
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,560
okay the more all these things can get

1164
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,720
worse and they do get worse

1165
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,560
that's why people with lyme disease get

1166
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,520
bled to death

1167
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,839
that's why people with cancer get bled

1168
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,800
to death

1169
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,240
people with cancer get bled to death

1170
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,359
their immune system is taken out their

1171
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,960
immune system's taken out

1172
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,960
constantly with the blood draw and

1173
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,880
that's how it works and i talked about

1174
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
that many times right

1175
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,079
that's how it works you're getting the

1176
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,680
blood taken out you're getting the blood

1177
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,280
taken out and too much blood

1178
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,200
clubhouse i'm holding an arm in my hand

1179
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
right now i got a blood vial

1180
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,160
right in my other hand here and

1181
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,079
that's what's happening they take too

1182
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,560
much blood you got cancer

1183
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,400
they want blood every three days they

1184
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,480
want blood once a week

1185
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,160
but they don't just take a little bit of

1186
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,000
blood because that's all they need is a

1187
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,720
little touch of blood they take a lot of

1188
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,480
blood

1189
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,640
is what they do they take a large amount

1190
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,599
so much so a large amount that they

1191
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,640
don't need

1192
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,680
and that's how it works right and

1193
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,800
um and then so but

1194
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,800
you'll get told oh don't worry we'll

1195
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,000
just get the old blood out

1196
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,560
so new blood is created so now you're

1197
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,680
you've got

1198
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,760
healthy blood it's almost like that's

1199
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,200
the bloodletting technique that killed a

1200
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,640
lot of people that's the bloodletting

1201
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,280
technique from the 1600 to 1700 to 1500s

1202
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,200
you got sick they cut your vein they cut

1203
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,960
your arm when you got sick they cut you

1204
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,839
and they bled you

1205
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,599
right big pan of blood and if you

1206
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,359
survived that

1207
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,040
cut while you were sick it's a miracle

1208
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,040
so they did they basically just ended

1209
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,920
your life bloodletting was a way to kill

1210
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,839
people

1211
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,119
it was just your everybody knew when

1212
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,760
they were getting bloodletted

1213
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,000
they knew they were done you know why

1214
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,400
anybody sick back in that day

1215
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,240
didn't come back from bloodletting they

1216
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,680
didn't bounce back they didn't all of a

1217
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,359
sudden he'll be a miracle if they

1218
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,520
actually healed

1219
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,720
and they survived the bloodletting

1220
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,440
technique

1221
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,839
so you're being told the same old thing

1222
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,040
an

1223
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,119
old way of doing something

1224
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
that was basically devastating to

1225
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,640
families

1226
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,000
if a child got sick back in the the

1227
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,280
1700s

1228
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,160
in 1800s if a child got sick they would

1229
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,520
bloodlet the child to death

1230
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,560
the untold sorrow and pain

1231
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,880
that has occurred from bloodletting but

1232
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,160
no

1233
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,079
hey let's just follow that same old lead

1234
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,680
let's just know the more blood donate

1235
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,079
blood the more blood that comes out of

1236
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,800
you

1237
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,400
hey fresh new blood will come back it's

1238
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,800
a bloodletting

1239
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:17,520
but here's the thing okay

1240
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,359
it takes an unbelievable amount of

1241
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,400
resources to rebuild

1242
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,319
your blood so it's not just about

1243
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,160
getting some water down

1244
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,280
hey drink a lot of water make sure you

1245
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
drink a lot of water you get all that

1246
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,760
blood taken out of you drink a lot of

1247
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,680
water

1248
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,599
uh your blood will be back to normal by

1249
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,520
that night no not at all you'll be

1250
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,079
filled with more water

1251
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,920
not blood eat eat a whole bunch of food

1252
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,440
that'll build up your blood fast that

1253
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,480
doesn't build up your blood fast your

1254
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,160
blood is still

1255
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,240
people who get who don't eat blood

1256
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,599
they're sick for months many people

1257
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
many people who donate blood it's the

1258
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,880
last time they ever donate blood

1259
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,800
because they couldn't even walk out of

1260
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,480
there and they were sick for months

1261
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,480
i'm not saying don't donate blood it's

1262
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,000
just that women are trained to donate

1263
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,359
blood guess who donates the blood it's

1264
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,839
the women

1265
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,119
and the sick women so that's who donates

1266
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,920
that's that's the blood donors out here

1267
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,440

1268
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,040

1269
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,800

1276
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,520
are trained

1277
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,160
to be the blood givers on this planet

1278
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,960
right so here's what happens you walk

1279
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,000
into

1280
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,359
you hop on to a blood donating

1281
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,079
bus or you stand there at that bus

1282
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,560
and you interview everybody coming on

1283
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,480
okay

1284
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,319

fog they all got all these different

1291
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
symptoms

1292
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,640
and they're filing in dumping their

1293
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,680
blood giving their blood away

1294
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,520
to the blood machine the blood monster

1295
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,760
and that's what they're doing okay

1296
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,119
that's a whole problem all on its own

1297
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,960
no one's no one's like being held

1298
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,839
accountable for the mistakes made in all

1299
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,520
that

1300
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,760
the irony is you only need a little bit

1301
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,200
of blood that's the irony

1302
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,200
i don't know if you call an irony or you

1303
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,319
call it just the biggest screw-up on the

1304
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,240
planet

1305
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,480
you only need a little bit of blood

1306
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,160
right so

1307
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,599
and people people don't know that that

1308
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,040
you only need that much blood

1309

1312
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,319

in that right there

1322
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,520
but they drain us to death and it is

1323
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,359
it's like a slow death when you got lyme

1324
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,119
disease it's a slow death when you got

1325
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,160
bad case of lupus it's a slow death when

1326
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,839
you got something

1327
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,760
because they keep on pulling that blood

1328
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:05,280
out pulling that blood out

1329
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,319
and yeah we lose our immune system

1330
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,680
right there we lose our immune cells and

1331
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,280
one of the reasons why i'm even talking

1332
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,480
about this right now isn't just because

1333
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,280
elite maha

1334
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,800
you know brought this up but it's good

1335
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,480
to talk about this because this is one

1336
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,160
of the death by a thousand cuts this is

1337
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,400
one of the things we get exposed to we

1338
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,359
have to be really cautious about

1339
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,599
keep that in mind right there um

1340
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:34,559
yeah so i'm making a healing bra right

1341
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,160
now you guys

1342
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,079

tick tock good to see you guys

1345
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,240
incredible all right so talk about the

1346
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,440
zinc shock therapy let's do that

1347
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,040
zinc shock therapy is is is really an

1348
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,079
awesome medical medium tool

1349
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,680
okay and um

1350
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,559
because what happens with your white

1351
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,240
count is your white counts hungry for

1352
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,520
zinc because we're all zinc deficient i

1353
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
talked about this the other day we're

1354
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,559
all

1355
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,520
severely zinc deficient there's no zinc

1356
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,200
in our food

1357
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,800
okay if you're eating pumpkin seeds or

1358
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,599
oysters you're not going to get the sink

1359
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,480
you need

1360
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,040
i mean i hate to break that to you right

1361
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,640
because i

1362
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,960
i hear that all the time just eat some

1363
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,640
oysters are you kidding me

1364
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,319
you can eat all the oysters you want the

1365
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,839
only thing you can eventually get again

1366
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,280
is hepatitis

1367
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,800
which is basically a liver infection

1368
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,880
neptune bar liver infection but the

1369
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,559
reason why oysters will give you that

1370
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,160
some bad oysters will give you that is

1371
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,680
because they're so toxic they dropped

1372
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,440
your immune system flat

1373
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,880
boom they killed your immune system so

1374
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,880
that epstein-barr can take off

1375
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,280
that's how it works there so your white

1376
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,400
your white count loves zinc

1377
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,160
right and zinc shock therapy um

1378
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
is a great way of getting it you know

1379
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,200
what i've done with with family members

1380
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,720
and friends and

1381
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,359
you do what your doctor tells you guys

1382
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,359
you know i'm just showing you what i do

1383
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,720
nancy says how do we build our blood

1384
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,040

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,640
the blood draw

1388
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,800
episode i got it all there like it's

1389
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,119
it's packed with information right there

1390
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,240
yeah lorraine oysters is pretty funny

1391
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,760
and

1392
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,119
yeah and then people say well pumpkin

1393
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
seeds that's a great way to get sick

1394
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,839
we'll do our pumpkin

1395
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,359
seats it's like you need barrels of

1396
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,280
pumpkin seeds

1397
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,040
in order to get the zinc you need it's

1398
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,720
just that and it's not that zinc is

1399
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,160
it's not even pumpkin seeds or high in

1400
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,280
zinc it's just that they're they

1401
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,000
register enough in pumpkin seeds for

1402
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,000
them to actually

1403
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,119
say hey they're high in z they're not

1404
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,559
high in zinc

1405
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,200
there's no food high in zinc anymore

1406
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,680
zinc shock therapy works every time

1407
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,280

all the time

1451
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,000

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,960
every three hours right every waking

1461
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,520
three hours so you wake up in the

1462
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,160
morning like i don't feel good

1463
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839
or i was exposed to something or i think

1464
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,119
i'm coming down with something

1465
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,680
and i was talking about the other day

1466
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,040
how people eat when they're

1467
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,960
coming down with something they eat and

1468
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,240
they'll just tank they'll start tanking

1469
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,160
some pizza they'll start taking

1470
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,160
something else they'll start eating

1471
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,440
or they'll eat heavily or even if it's

1472
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,640
healthier food but they're going to just

1473
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,200
start eating

1474
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,760
and when people start coming down with

1475
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,559
something

1476
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,400
if their stomach doesn't go too sick

1477
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,319
when they're coming down with something

1478
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,559
they just start eating it's like this

1479
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,920
natural instinct of i need something i

1480
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,079

in your body i need the soup to finish

1616
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,839

steam to go a different area

1620
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,760
here we go okay

1621
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,440
it's like a smoke screen going across

1622
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,119
right now

1623
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,280
so what they do okay here's here's the

1624
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,200
first thing so they drain your blood

1625
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,319
that's what they'll do right with that

1626
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,559
condition

1627
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,359
but they don't know why someone even has

1628
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,680
it and

1629
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,640
then i talk to doctors many times about

1630
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,319
this condition

1631
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,480
and because it's it's always a mystery

1632
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,640
all these conditions are mysteries right

1633
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,920
but but that's a viral condition

1634
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,880
anything going

1635
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,000
wrong with blood is a hundred percent

1636
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,480
viral

1637
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,359
and epsilon bars are the real those are

1638
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,480
the real

1639
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:15,040
viral stir the pot bugs right there

1640
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,160
sometimes the hhv-6 and the hhv-7 will

1641
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,280
stir the pot too

1642
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,440
see an hhv-8 stir the pot i've seen

1643
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,920
hhv-9s through the pot i've seen these

1644
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,319
viruses the cytomegalovirus stir the pot

1645
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,720
but i've seen bar is the big one for

1646
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:31,200
anything blood related though

1647
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,799
anything blood related so well how do we

1648
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,680
work with that so what do we do you know

1649
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,280
what i mean so

1650
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,200
i would take the new addition to your

1651
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,319
doctor

1652
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,359
talk to him about epstein-barr or find a

1653
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,359
doctor

1654
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,880
that is open to understanding

1655
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,359
epstein-barr

1656
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,040
because once you do and you start

1657
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,040
working

1658
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,880
basically working helping your body

1659
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,880
battle the upsteam bar

1660
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,240
and start cleaning it up that condition

1661
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,599
starts to go back to normal

1662
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,359
where you start going back to normal

1663
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,119
i've seen it on and on and off over the

1664
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,680
years so many times

1665
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,880
you know happening so when people start

1666
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,880
doing the right thing

1667
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,880
they start getting better um

1668
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,119
okay you guys got the healing broth

1669
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:16,559

gonna do some water over here

1675
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,839
so all this information is really really

1676
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,839
important

1677
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,400
let's get the tea kettle going a little

1678
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,400
bit

1679
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,640
lorraine says ebv for blood related

1680
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,359
makes sense it does it really does do

1681
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,720
the vitamin c

1682
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,799
shock therapy let's go into that a

1683
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,839
little bit we're live on youtube

1684
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:59,520
facebook clubhouse

1685
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:00,480
so you're welcome to use any vitamin c

1686
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,520
you want for this

1687
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,680
i mean i use the vimergy one

1688
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,040
it's so easy on the system there's a lot

1689
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,319
of vitamin c's out there they're like

1690
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,480
battery acid

1691
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,599
they're just they're hard to get down

1692
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,240
that ascorbic

1693
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,960
acid is really difficult on a lot of

1694
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,960
people

1695
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,559
right chris you seem fine to me good to

1696
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,920
see you you know it's that

1697
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,839
it's that ascorbic acid nature

1698
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,040
that type of vitamin c is really rough

1699
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:28,160
right

1700
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,760
but i like um

1701
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,319
but i like the vitamin c shock therapy

1702
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,079
with the micro c the vimergy micro c i'm

1703
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:37,280
not sponsored by this guys you guys

1704
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,799
so you know you guys know so

1705
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,680
back to the immune system let's talk a

1706
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,440
little bit more about how to build it

1707
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,359
you can't rebuild your immune system if

1708
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,599
you don't understand it

1709
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,280
right even if someone tells you oh

1710
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,480
vitamin c is good for your immune system

1711
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,559
it doesn't mean you're going to do it

1712
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,880
right or do it for the right time

1713
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,400
or do it right time period or understand

1714
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,200
it to keep it going

1715
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,920
no like there's there's so much to know

1716
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,520
okay

1717
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,720
you might be somebody's oh vitamin c is

1718
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,240
good for your immune system and then you

1719
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,480
get given this vitamin

1720
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,079
that has a little this multivitamin it

1721
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,599
has a little bit of vitamin c in there

1722
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,359
but it's worthless

1723
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,240
multivitamins are one of probably one of

1724
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,240
the most worthless

1725
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,440
worthless alternative medicine tools

1726
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,000
that are out there and i don't even know

1727
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,599
if i could

1728
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,760
call it even a tool because it shouldn't

1729
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,960
even gain that much respect

1730
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,040
it's it really falls short it's a money

1731
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,720
making scheme

1732
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,720
for the alternative therapy industries

1733
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,640
so that's important that's a that's

1734
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,920
worth the price of admission right here

1735
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,000
if you wondered why you're even here

1736
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,160
right now during this live watching me

1737
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
make a pot of soup peeling broth

1738
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,200
that that right there is just worth its

1739
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,040
price of admission

1740
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,480
even though this is free even though

1741
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,520
this is all free

1742
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,280
because the because what they do

1743
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,440
is it's really just to rip off those

1744
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,640
multivitamins are all

1745
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,440
bulk low grade stock

1746
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,760
from 10 years ago just so you know now

1747
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,280
you're going to look at the date

1748
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,119
you're going to look at the date on your

1749
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,280
multivitamin say well

1750
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,160
medical medium's wrong again always

1751
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,240
trying to catch medical medium catch him

1752
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,839
catch him while you can he never

1753
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,839
contradicts himself it's always hard to

1754
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:21,520
kick can't catch him ever

1755
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:23,760
and he's wrong because the date on this

1756
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,920
multivitamin is it's not due until

1757
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,839
it's not expired until next year so once

1758
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,119
again he's wrong

1759
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,119
no once again medical means right

1760
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,240
because this because they started the

1761
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,680
new date

1762
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,880
on the multivitamin when they

1763
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,520
encapsulated it

1764
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,000
when they actually encapsulated you guys

1765
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,280
john on clubhouse that's what happens

1766
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,039
okay they they start that date

1767
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:54,240
process when they put it in the capsule

1768
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:55,760
or the tablet john that's when they

1769
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,200
started

1770
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:03,039
just so you guys know that stuff

1771
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:06,559
has sat around for years sometimes

1772
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,880
10 to 15 years

1773
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,839
just so you know and then when it

1774
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,839
finally goes into the vitamin

1775
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,960
you got your multivitamin and they use a

1776
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,799
speck of everything

1777
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,160
little speck of this and then you got

1778
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,839
these vitamins now

1779
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,000
and these powders out there and have a

1780
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,720
speck of everything a speck of nettle

1781
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,680
a speck of alfalfa a speck of some kind

1782
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,799
of protein

1783
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,680
a you know speck of choline a speck of

1784
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,680
lysine a speck of whatever and it

1785
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:37,359
doesn't do anything

1786
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,680
at all because it's not enough

1787
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,359
a speck of lemon balm because medical

1788
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,640
means talks about lemon bomb now you got

1789
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,400
a new supplement company around the

1790
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,720
corner every single day

1791
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,160
now speck of zinc because medical medium

1792
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,640
brought zinc into the world

1793
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,599
but pretty much not not entirely

1794
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,920
obviously

1795
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,760
but in the sense where it's it's on the

1796
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,520
scene for viral stuff because of medical

1797
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,880
medium information for 35 years it's

1798
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,880
like okay let's put a little

1799
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,000
little cat's claw in here a little this

1800
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,039
a little that

1801
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,039
and it's not enough and then we buy it

1802
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,720
but here's how it works the company is

1803
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,280
making all this money these companies

1804
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,599
out there

1805
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,799
are making all this money because they

1806
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,280
think and they'll put

1807
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,200
immune something on the bottle like good

1808
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,359

1809
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,039
right so hey i'm going to take this

1810
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,680
immune system supplement

1811
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,359
meanwhile there's so very little in that

1812
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,920
bottle of each thing

1813
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,160
that when it all adds up it's just one

1814
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,680
big filler in a way your body can't do

1815
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,160
anything with that there's two

1816
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,520
little bits of it and they're usually

1817
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,280
old

1818
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,559

is getting eaten up by chemicals

1854
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,200
nanotechnology it's a whole other thing

1855
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,799
i mean that's chemical warfare right

1856
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,400
there it's sprayed on everything you buy

1857
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:22,880
now everything new we buy

1858
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,480
has nanotechnology sprayed on it right

1859
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,440
so many things have nanotechnology and

1860
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,079
then wood

1861
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,319
you buy a new piece of wood it's treated

1862
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,960
you all that green stuff is on the wood

1863
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,440
that's

1864
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,160
treated so wood that's treated right

1865
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,240
then of course

1866
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,559
termite spray termite spray is around

1867
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,960
all the buildings apartment buildings

1868
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,799
you know these are other exposures too

1869
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,119
all this stuff is exposures

1870
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,359
we're up against every day right put the

1871
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,640
orange in here put the raw honey

1872
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,640
two capsules vitamin c

1873
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:59,599
vitamin c shock therapy right there

1874
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:02,000
um yeah so great

1875
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,880
so great to have so this is coming along

1876
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,880
this is simmering

1877
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:10,000
let me get a

1878
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:20,240
something here

1879
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,240
just looking for

1880
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:28,240
got this right here you guys i'm going

1881
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:31,119
to move this around

1882
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,119
making the broth

1883
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:41,039
now if i was coming down with something

1884
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,039
me personally i'd be making this broth

1885
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,119
and i would be cautious to not dump a

1886
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:48,079
whole bunch of fat into my system

1887
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,359
i wouldn't do any avocado i like avocado

1888
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,839
i like avocado

1889
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:53,200
i have a little here and there i like it

1890
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,240
it's a healthy fat

1891
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,039
okay but if you're exposed you're coming

1892
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,039
down with something

1893
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,240
that fat will not protect your immune

1894
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,359
system

1895
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,119
it just doesn't do that okay so

1896
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,720
it's something to know same thing i'm

1897
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,480
not gonna eat a whole bunch of tahini if

1898
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,400
i was exposed to something

1899
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,319
so i'm exposed to some chemicals if i

1900
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,079
was exposed to some pathogens if i was

1901
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,839
exposed to something else

1902
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,359
i wouldn't be downing a whole bunch of

1903
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,120
nut butters and nuts

1904
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,799
i wouldn't be downing and i wouldn't be

1905
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,799
eating a steak

1906
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,799
i mean i don't eat steak anyway but you

1907
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,279
know and i support anybody who does eat

1908
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,199
you know

1909
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,640

1910
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,839
i still can help you heal

1911
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,319
with the information that spirit of

1912
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,799
compassion has has given us

1913
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,239

1924
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,640
if i was coming down with something so i

1925
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,600
wouldn't have well you know i wouldn't

1926
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,159
be doing butter

1927
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,719
and cheese and milk if i was coming down

1928
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:03,520
something

1929
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,960
like one way to get sick when you're

1930
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,960
exposed to something

1931
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,239
is down a whole bunch of cheese butter

1932
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,600
or milk that's

1933
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:15,040
or eggs right then you know

1934
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,040
a whole bunch of eggs right there right

1935
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,719
so let me make an omelet i feel sick i

1936
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,600
feel like or i feel like i was exposed

1937
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,120
to something

1938
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,880
let me just crack a whole bunch of eggs

1939
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,359
open and make an omelette right

1940
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,799
that's the last thing i would do right

1941
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,199
guess what people do

1942
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,239
and then you know people down pizza they

1943
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,000
down eggs

1944
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,359
even if it's like a healthy version they

1945
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,080
got vegetables on their pizza and the

1946
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,120
whole bit

1947
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,199
when they're getting sick or they're

1948
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,480
exposed they're eating all this food

1949
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,319
and what happens is this all that

1950
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,880
digestive strength

1951
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:47,600
your digestion all the strength it takes

1952
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,880
to digest food

1953
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:53,759
can lower your immune system all that

1954
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,280
digestive strength

1955
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,800
one of the greatest pieces of

1956
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,320
information i can give you is if you

1957
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,560
think you were exposed eat light that

1958
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,920
night

1959
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,280
let your immune system be just focused

1960
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,199
on what's floating around that

1961
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,800
bloodstream and keep the fats

1962
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:13,280
out or keep them low keep them low

1963
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,600
don't like don't have a big guacamole on

1964
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,199
that day you think you were exposed on

1965
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,000
that night you think you were exposed

1966
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,840
you guys don't have a big old guacamole

1967
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,280
because all that's going to do is fill

1968
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,560
your bloodstream up with fat and then

1969
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,560
your white count is going to be trying

1970
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,920
to navigate through that fat to look for

1971
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,199
any invaders

1972
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,080
so if you think you're exposed by

1973
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:34,159
pandemic stuff

1974
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,840
right you don't want to be tanking the

1975
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,239
fats you don't want to fat yourself to

1976
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,520
death

1977
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,880
because that's what everybody's doing

1978
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,920
they're being taught to fat themselves

1979
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,800
to death

1980
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,480
if you were exposed to a flu someone's

1981
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,640
got a sinus infection

1982
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,520
which could be streptococcus someone's

1983
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,440
got a stye

1984
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,920
which could be streptococcus you don't

1985
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,159
want to be

1986
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,199
you don't want to be filling your gullet

1987
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,640
with fat

1988
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,320
you don't want to be filling your goat

1989
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,440
with that no no no no

1990
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,719
no pizza guacamole uh

1991
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,840
tacos uh you know nachos um

1992
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,280
milk cheese butter eggs nut butters

1993
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,040
oatmeal with peanut butter on it you

1994
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,560
don't you don't want a grilled cheese

1995
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,760
sandwich grilled cheese sandwich you

1996
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,159
don't want to do that if you were

1997
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,920
exposed

1998
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,480
so important enough right there that

1999
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:24,000
that information alone is so

2000
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,199
is so critical so let's run by this if

2001
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,040
you guys just came on too

2002
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,560

2015
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,600
