1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,720
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,560
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,400
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,880
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,239
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,760
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,760
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,199
William we're talking about sodium salt

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,000
do you like salt do you eat salt do you

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,519
drink salt are you adding salt to your

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,239
water because the trend tells you so and

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,760
what about a sodium deficient iy we're

19
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,080
talking about that too it takes some

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,240
serious bravery learning salt truth but

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,320
it never goes well everyone usually just

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,759
freaks out the addiction is stronger

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,320
than people believe the salt demon

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,280
almost always wins hang on for this ride

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,040
and get yourself comfy because we are on

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,040
the salt

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,640
Express so I've been putting Salt in My

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,159
Water yeah you should do it too I saw

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
this like scientific study online that

30
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,079
says like you need the sodium especially

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,360
if you're working out yeah even my

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
trainer who's like really

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,479
hot he said it should be in your water

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,320
every time you drink especially since we

35
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,600
work out so much yeah so I thought I

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
would just try it and I really like it I

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,399
feel so much

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,960
better the sodium in your water trend

39
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,439
a trend that you would think is so

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,920
backed by science and so important for

41
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,160
us but all it's really doing is just

42
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,640
adding salt to already a high salt diet

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,319
because that's what our society does

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,400
salts everything and we get salted

45
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,360
practically to death so first let's

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
address the salt in the water trick it's

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
a dangerous trick no one would believe

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,959
it it's almost

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,959
unbelievable but here's what happen

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,720
happens when you put salt in water and

51
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,959
send it down on an empty stomach and you

52
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,680
may not have had food before or shortly

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,920
after then that salt that salt water

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,200
goes directly into the liver not to

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,519
detoxify it not to help it but to pickle

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:56,480
it to actually pickle it the last thing

57
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,480
our livers want is salt shock salt shock

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,080
it's what happens when it mainlines

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,840
right to the liver with nothing thing

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,040
buffering it you ever see what happens

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
when a body part is

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:13,599
salted you know like a pig

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,239
rump or some type of meat and it's

64
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,920
salted a salt rub and then it sits there

65
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,720
and ferments the salt just sucks the

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,519
juice out of it over time if you salt a

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,599
human being while they're alive they'll

68
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,760
die if you pack somebody's body with

69
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,720
salt like like pack them with salt where

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,720
their whole body's covered in salt and

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,760
then wrap them up with foil make sure

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,480
they're nice and packed nice and tight

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,760
and neat over time their skin would

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,840
practically melt off their

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,959
juices would leave their body they would

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,920
get severely dehydrated their tissue

77
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,959
their muscle meat would get

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,760
dehydrated their blood would turn into a

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,760
salty soup they would die we're told out

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,079
there all the time by people in the

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,519
trainer world the exercise world the

82
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,680
Science World that were made of salt the

83
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,680
medical world that were made of salt not

84
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,919
true yes sodium's a critical mineral yes

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,759
we have it in our bloodstream and in our

86
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,199
organs yes we need it yes it's the

87
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
foundation of a building block an

88
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,240
electrolyte yes we need it for

89
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
neurotransmitters

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,560
but too much of a good thing goes bad

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,560
too much of the wrong good thing goes

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,400
worse there's two worlds of thought out

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,880
there one is the old standard American

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,479
Medical model which is you got to watch

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,560
out for sodium too much sodium not good

96
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,759
for your heart not good for your blood

97
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,400
pressure stay away from salt do a no

98
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,720
salt diet that was the old standard

99
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,440
medical model and then the new

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Alternative Health SL conventional

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,520
medical model SL health model which is

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,080
you need sodium you need salt and they

103
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,600
believe the old conventional model of

104
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,440
being salt-free as wrong they think it's

105
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,280
wrong information outdated bad and so

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,520
forth but both worlds are wrong we do

107
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,639
need salt our bloodstream needs salt but

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,960
the right kind of salt our bloodstream

109
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,919
doesn't need a teaspoon of salt or huge

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,280
pinch of salt in a glass of water our

111
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,120
bloodstream our organs don't need a

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,479
glass of water every few hours with a

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,199
pinch of salt in it either we don't need

114
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,199
direct hits of salt like this if someone

115
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,960
has a liver disease sosis of liver

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,080
hepatitis C or a liver that's on the

117
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,440
edge of failing and you do a whole glass

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,280
of water and you put a nice hunk of salt

119
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,960
in there or a pinch of salt you're

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,479
risking a liver shut down you're risking

121
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,600
a liver failure because your liver is

122
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,919
going to uptake that sodium it's going

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,160
to shock it and it doesn't shock it to

124
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,560
cleanse it the shock instead paralyzes

125
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,960
it puts it in a different motion shuts

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,560
it down slows it down hard salt is toxic

127
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,680
toxic to the body but yet we're being

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,000
told and conditioned every day in the

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,560
health movement that salt is healthy for

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,039
the body so much so it's actually scary

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,560
everybody's pushing sodium pushing salt

132
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
of course they're pushing the good salt

133
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,759
and they're standing behind that

134
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,560
rightfully so good salt is good salt if

135
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,039
you're going to use it but salt is still

136
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,440
toxic highly toxic on the body in large

137
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,120
quantities in large quantities and

138
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,720
that's what's happening now it's

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,039
different if you have a little bit going

140
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,120
on your food you have a buffer the

141
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,120
liver's buffered it can actually

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,199
disperse differently it gets into the

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,440
bloodstream differently but when it's in

144
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,759
the glasses of water and thrown in there

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,440
like that straight empty stomach most of

146
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,400
the time it shock toxic shock syndrome

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,160
to the liver through Salt and when high

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,120
quality sodium high quality salt is on

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,440
food it has a different delivery system

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,879
it can Bond onto something hopefully

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Bond onto something temporarily maybe

152
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,000
not longterm but temporarily all these

153
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,400
different nutrients you have have in all

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,240
your different foods antioxidants and

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,440
phyton nutrients of all kinds sitting

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,800
there right in front of you on your

157
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,800
plate the salt gets put on there there's

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,599
a chance it's going to bond to something

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,520
at least temporarily you have a better

160
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,360
chance when it's like that when it's

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,800
with food a better chance you won't get

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,199
a shutdown a better chance the salt will

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,680
be bonded now remember if you're on a

164
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,680
ship and you're thirsty and you're out

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
there on the ocean for a long time and

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,759
you start drinking that salt water guess

167
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,840
what happens you die you get dehydrated

168
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,319
you get pickled and you die and guess

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,639
what it happened over and over again out

170
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,159
there people got desperate they were in

171
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,479
the ocean on the ocean maybe they were

172
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,960
stranded somewhere and they drank and

173
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,599
consumed salt water if it was okay to

174
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,639
stick salt and water every single day

175
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,120
while you're training or exercising or

176
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,319
living your life just doing it every day

177
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,039
if it was okay then it would be okay to

178
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,279
drink it in a glass

179
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,159
right out of the ocean on a ship every

180
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,080
day but what saves somebody to do it now

181
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,640
out of a glass and a pinch is they end

182
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,560
up doing something else a little later

183
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,039
they drink coffee they have a snack they

184
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,680
have a shake they have some food they

185
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,120
have dinner and it keeps them in the

186
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,839
okay enough Zone they're still damaging

187
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,920
themselves they're still damaging their

188
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,440
liver but it keeps them in a safety zone

189
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,839
enough to not notice it now you would

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,920
think the brain it runs on electrolyt

191
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,839
neurotransmitters need

192
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,640
electrolytes sodium is something the

193
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,600
brain needs then you would think

194
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,880
drinking seawater every day on a

195
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,959
stranded ship would feed the brain you

196
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,079
would do pretty good but instead it

197
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,720
pickles the brain and that's what

198
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,399
happens it's not just the liver that

199
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
goes into shock the brain goes into

200
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,880
shock over time you end up pickling the

201
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,360
brain your brain starts to die you would

202
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,040
think this would be known or common

203
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,480
sense would happen with someone you

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,640
can't drink ocean water because of the

205
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,240
salt the sodium you end up with a tragic

206
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,839
fate if you do so why is it good now why

207
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,079
is it good to take a glass of water and

208
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,560
add salt to it and drink it and promote

209
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,519
it like a health thing same as a lot of

210
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,839
things in alternative medicine and

211
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,440
conventional they're just wrong they

212
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,320
don't know it's the wild west mistakes

213
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,360
are made people suffer for it over time

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,880
nobody really talks about it it's swept

215
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,040
under the carpet but it becomes one big

216
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,480
great mistake if it was a good idea if

217
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,600
it was smart I would have talked about

218
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,360
it long time ago if it was intelligent

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,200
something to do something that was good

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,839
for us I would have been promoting it

221
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,560
and talking about it as a healing tool a

222
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:29,399
long time ago but instead s so told me

223
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,839
lemon water squeeze lemon in water flush

224
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,720
is the liver of all these poisons and

225
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,440
toxins first thing in the morning

226
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,920
flushes the body of toxins it provides

227
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,480
calcium provides vitamin C antioxidants

228
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,399
trace minerals it's a key way to heal

229
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,920
it's a very important aspect of healing

230
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,680
and don't think it's smart now adding

231
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,839
lemon to your salt water don't think

232
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,639
that's a great idea either where you put

233
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,320
a pinch of salt in your water then

234
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,000
squeeze lemon into it you're not

235
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,639
outsmarting the fox the Fox is still

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,480
going to break into the property and the

237
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,320
hen house it's still going to kill all

238
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,839
the chickens and then leave a scat and

239
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,200
laugh on its way out you're not going to

240
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,680
fix a problem by altering the problem

241
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,560
but keeping the problem still there

242
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,600
instead by adding the sodium the salt to

243
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,399
your lemon water if you're somebody that

244
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,120
does that you just threw off the balance

245
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,519
of what the lemon can do the lemon water

246
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,360
can't do the flushing action it once did

247
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,360
it can't be that cleanser for the liver

248
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,240
anymore it's been altered the salt

249
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,200
changed the chemistry and when the salt

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,040
changes the chemistry someone is not

251
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,079
going to get the results they need or

252
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,839
what they're looking for so when they're

253
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,120
drinking the lemon water because they

254
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
hear great things about it but they're

255
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,040
not getting results that they're

256
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,279
supposed to get from the lemon water

257
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,600
they're going to think something's wrong

258
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,720
and yes something is wrong they don't

259
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
know it it's the salt they added to the

260
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
lemon water if the lemon tree thought it

261
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,279
would be really smart to pull up all the

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,200
sodium from the earth and fill the lemon

263
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,760
with it and make it one big salt ball

264
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,680
one big salty lemon than it would have

265
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,399
happened in nature the lemon tree would

266
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,279
have drawn up sodium from the earth just

267
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,519
like celery does or spinach and it would

268
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,120
have been salty lemons would have been

269
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:29,399
really salty now lemons have a tiny bit

270
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,839
of sodium in it not harsh sodium not har

271
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:37,680
sodium not sea salt not Himalayan rock

272
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:40,680
salt but a tiny bit of Trace sodium if

273
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,320
there was supposed to be grams of sodium

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,920
in a lemon then there would be there's a

275
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,959
reason why there's not it throws off the

276
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,959
balance of what the lemon is there for

277
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:55,600
and what it does for us same thing as a

278
00:12:50,959 --> 00:13:00,199
tomato Trace levels of sodium but the

279
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,800
tomato plant isn't producing nor driving

280
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:07,279
up sodium from the soil into the Tomato

281
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,160
to make it super salty if a farmer or

282
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,240
Gardener Waters their crops with salt

283
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,920
water guess what happens you would think

284
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,800
maybe the salt water would just get

285
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,320
sucked up the sodium would get sucked up

286
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,399
everything maybe be saltier the sodium

287
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,320
would get into all the plants but no

288
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,560
everything dies you can't water a lemon

289
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,320
tree with so sodium based water salt

290
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,040
water you can't even have a portion of

291
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,800
that water to be saturated in sodium the

292
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,120
tree dies you can use a trace Mineral

293
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Solution you can do that and feed your

294
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,199
garden beds feed your plants your

295
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,720
flowers and your fruit trees you can do

296
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:56,120
it with a trace mineral complex fluid or

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,759
liquid that's designed to dilute and

298
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,440
nourish your plants but you can't just

299
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,480
take salt water and feed your plants

300
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,360
with it everything dies because that's

301
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,079
what happens we're like a plant in some

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,880
ways you can't just pack us with salt

303
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,240
like a salted fish will die and you

304
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,040
can't just fill us up with salt water

305
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,880
either cuz we will die as well but yet

306
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,079
we need sodium we need that mineral we

307
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,360
need it for our brains we need it for

308
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,680
our bloodstream we need it for our

309
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,279
tissue in organs and muscle in the 1970s

310
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,440
during heat waves science came up with

311
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,720
some information a lot of people were

312
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,440
drinking a lot of water during a heat

313
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,880
wave they were just guzzling gallons of

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,519
water throughout the day because it was

315
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,279
about staying hydrated it was really hot

316
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,560
it was sunny maybe they were in an area

317
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,720
without air conditioning a lot of people

318
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,959
back in the 70s did not have air

319
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,240
conditioning and during heat waves

320
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,959
people would eat less l so they wouldn't

321
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,759
eat some big old steak dinner with a

322
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,720
bunch of salt on it they wouldn't eat

323
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,000
some kind of food they wouldn't have

324
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,800
pancakes it wouldn't really have much of

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,880
anything the heat waves rolled in nobody

326
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,480
had air conditioning everybody was

327
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,199
trying to put ice on themselves from the

328
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,720
refrigerator and everybody was drinking

329
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,519
lots and lots of water and if somebody

330
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,600
didn't drown themselves where they drank

331
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,519
way too much more water than their

332
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,240
kidney can process more water than their

333
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,759
bloodstream can contain and hold and

334
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,720
they diluted themselves to such a degree

335
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,839
where their lungs filled with water and

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,920
they drowned if they didn't have that

337
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,399
happen and they were able to process

338
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,160
that water their kidneys were able to

339
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,240
excrete it and they were able to drink

340
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,279
couple of gallons a day a few gallons a

341
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,959
day during a heat wave then science of

342
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,480
research would say you're not retaining

343
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,440
the water during a heat wave it's

344
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,279
dangerous

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,319
there's no sodium people are just peeing

346
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,120
the water out as it's going in and

347
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:08,600
they're not getting hydrated so science

348
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,000
and conventional medicine had two

349
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,399
schools of thoughts you need to drink a

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,680
lot of water when there's a heat wave

351
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,480
and you can't drink a lot of water

352
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,279
during a heat wave cuz there's no sodium

353
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,600
reminds me of sugar we need blood sugar

354
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,160
to survive we have to have a certain

355
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,000
amount of blood sugar or we can't

356
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,079
function or live our brain needs glucose

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,079
Co sugar within 10 seconds 5 Seconds

358
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,959
actually before it starts to die if it

359
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:41,399
doesn't have it sugar is what makes our

360
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:44,079
bodies go around but yet there's a

361
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,519
massive war against sugar this is why

362
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,639
fruit was under attack for so long

363
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,240
natural sugar and fruit was under attack

364
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,959
Fruit fear I talked about it for many

365
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,920
many years everybody in Alternative

366
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,120
Health was against fruit they just were

367
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,800
they called it all sugar and told people

368
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,880
to stay away from it but if people don't

369
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,199
eat fruit of any kind where are they

370
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,400
going to get their glucose what other

371
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:16,640
sources lactose from dairy what else

372
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,679
corn different grains where are they

373
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,000
getting their sugar they have to get it

374
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,520
somewhere we have to survive we have to

375
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,720
live on it we have to have it in our

376
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,199
bloodstream but the details and the

377
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,880
nuances are critical in this because

378
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,080
there's healthy sugars that are

379
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,440
naturally derived from an apple and then

380
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,760
there's corn syrup high fructose corn

381
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,520
syrup there's also other sugars too

382
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,919
there's honey which is a very healthy

383
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,200
sugar and then at the same time there's

384
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,280
lactose Dairy which is not a good sugar

385
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,320
all these Details Matter for somebody to

386
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,640
be healthy and to protect your health

387
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,880
and give them what they need same thing

388
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,159
with sodium we need it in our

389
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,960
bloodstream in our organs in our brain

390
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,400
the details matter there's a big

391
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,280
difference from coconut water which has

392
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,120
sodium in it and celery juice which has

393
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,039
sodium in it and spinach which has

394
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,120
sodium in it versus road salt or a

395
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,880
healthier salt like a good Himalayan

396
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,960
rock salt or a good sea salt there's a

397
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,280
big difference plus when you drink

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,520
coconut water you can't control the

399
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,000
amount of sodium in there unless you add

400
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:31,000
it to it it's naturally balanced just

401
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,760
right The Human Condition but when you

402
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,720
farm salt and you hold on to it in your

403
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,000
hand you have your free will and control

404
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,400
you're the one taking it throwing it in

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,679
water you see it's not like cooking a

406
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,080
water that's nature doing it somebody's

407
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
hand isn't going and throwing salt up on

408
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,200
the tree and it somehow gets inside that

409
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,520
coconut it's not it's sealed but we take

410
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,240
it in our hand our shaker we pinch it

411
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,760
whatever we want and we throw it right

412
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,480
into that water it's different than

413
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,039
adding some sodium to your food the

414
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,080
sodium going into food gets buffered it

415
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,960
may not be the best thing you don't want

416
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,520
a lot of it on there but at the same

417
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,720
time it is getting buffered to a safety

418
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,000
zone unless it's so much salt it makes

419
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,679
things complicated now if you take honey

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
for example do a tablespoon of honey

421
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,559
because you got your free will you got

422
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,520
the jar of honey you're not just doing a

423
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,880
teaspoon you're digging in and doing a

424
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,520
big old tablespoon in your cup of tea

425
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,559
that's your free will doing it or you're

426
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,240
going to get in trouble not like salt

427
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,159
take a tablespoon of salt dump it in

428
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,039
that glass of water and send it down

429
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,400
there's a huge difference take a

430
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,480
tablespoon of honey put it in your mouth

431
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,280
Chomp on it swallow it eat it it's

432
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,840
different you take a tablespoon of salt

433
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,480
put it in your mouth and sit there and

434
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,679
Chomp on it and Chomp on it and then

435
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,880
swallow it and eat it you'll see two

436
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,159
different beasts but let's talk about

437
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,360
saltwater gargling that's a different

438
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,360
thing all on its own I like it for

439
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,480
certain things somebody has something

440
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,039
like an ulcer in their mouth they can do

441
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,679
some saltwater gargling but understand

442
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,799
this if you make it nice and thick with

443
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,880
salt little glass of warm water you put

444
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,760
a good tablespoon or more salt in there

445
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,120
you mix it up until it disappears and

446
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,000
then you gargle with it you're not going

447
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,840
to want to swallow all of that you're

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,520
not going to want to drink that with all

449
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,120
the salt in there because there's a good

450
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,480
chance you're going to vomit it back up

451
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,240
because your body has a mechanism it

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,200
knows it's trouble it knows it's

453
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,760
problematic and it doesn't want it going

454
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,840
down and you end up getting a

455
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,880
reflex your brain gets a message sends

456
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,679
it right down to the Vegas nerves your

457
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,360
Vegas nerves say no and that stuff comes

458
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,240
right back up but when you're gargling

459
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,559
you're really not supposed to swallow it

460
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,880
you're not you're supposed to spit it

461
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,919
back out and rinse your mouth out just

462
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,120
like when you're on a ship floating Out

463
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,080
on the Ocean and you ran out of your

464
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,600
water supply you're not supposed to be

465
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,080
sitting there drinking flasks of water

466
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,120
that came out of the ocean salt water

467
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,440
you can garl it but you can't swallow it

468
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,480
but yet once again our bodies need

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,600
sodium they do and some people they

470
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,400
fight an addiction because of it because

471
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,520
yeah we do need it but yet we get

472
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,880
addicted to it and our favorite way to

473
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:41,279
eat salt is with oil especially on chips

474
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,600
salty oily salty greasy salt and fat

475
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,760
it's our favorite combination and what

476
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,200
happens is the fat cuts the

477
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:55,440
salt that's right the fat cuts the salt

478
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:59,600
hides it just enough we love that fatty

479
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,919
salty crunchy taste we're the only

480
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,960
creature on the planet that adds salt to

481
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,559
everything all the other creatures on

482
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,720
the planet they're not doing that you

483
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,559
think a family of bunny rabbits are

484
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,080
sitting there saying pass the salt hey

485
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,919
let me have those few Blades of grass

486
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,640
get some salt on this thing it's bland

487
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,760
what about a lion lion wants some animal

488
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,960
meat is that lion saying Oo we need some

489
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,880
salt cracked on top of this meat right

490
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,440
here it's not salty enough I want to

491
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,480
have my meat salt to taste and what

492
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,159
about a monkey that likes to eat wild

493
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,039
figs is that monkey saying this fig

494
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,440
needs salt whoa I'm eating a bunch of

495
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,000
figs I feel like I need some salt here

496
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,320
please pass the salt somebody what about

497
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,440
a bear bears eat some meat too they're

498
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,720
not asking for the salt they're not

499
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,919
craving the salt they're not saying hey

500
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,000
this piece of meat that I just killed

501
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,440
this animal that I just killed needs a

502
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,080
whole bunch of salt it's too land jucky

503
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,200
don't get mistaken when you hear

504
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,480
something about a rock salt deposit

505
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,320
somewhere on a Mountaintop that an

506
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,400
animal went up to and licked and that

507
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,640
was all of a sudden the answer to it all

508
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,679
first of all it's a big planet there's

509
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,480
not a lot of options for that salt just

510
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,960
isn't everywhere laying everywhere

511
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,440
totally exposed ready for every animal

512
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,440
to lick it very few Wild animals on this

513
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,360
planet have access to a salt deposit on

514
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,960
a Mountaintop somewhere on this planet

515
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,559
and when it comes to a when it comes to

516
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,520
raising animals for Slaughter or raising

517
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,679
animals in general for sale and so forth

518
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,200
what happens is they do the salt thing

519
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,080
for salt

520
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,880
addiction they salt up the pigs so pigs

521
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,520
eat more and more the fatter the bigger

522
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,840
the pig can win an award the same thing

523
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:05,440
thing with anything cows and so forth

524
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,919
fatten up the cows sell more meat

525
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,080
thicken up the steers then you can sell

526
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,720
them price per pound get them addicted

527
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,480
to sodium they sell salt blocks blocks

528
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,480
of salt they want animals to take a lick

529
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,200
if possible because steers can get fussy

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,520
with their food if the steer gets too

531
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,840
lean it's not good farmer is mad they

532
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,399
salt the food they want them to lick the

533
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,840
salt blocks it makes them hungry gets

534
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:37,559
them addicted to more food then they can

535
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:41,240
feed them more thicken them up and sell

536
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:44,120
them package food companies for humans

537
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,120
put a lot of salt in there plus MSG

538
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,399
people like it they eat more they get

539
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,960
addicted they fatten up they want to eat

540
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,080
more they buy it again and again and

541
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,840
again same old trick restaurants put the

542
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,240
salt in the food people love it

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,120
they come in more and more they eat more

544
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,520
of it they go to a big old open Buffet

545
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,159
they eat all they can eat the salt makes

546
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,000
them nice and hungry everybody's happy

547
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,679
that's how it rolls back centuries ago

548
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,720
when salt was for sale and it was a big

549
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,120
deal it was for preserving because

550
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,080
people didn't have a way to preserve the

551
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,480
either fermented food or salted things

552
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,240
fermented things or salted things or

553
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,880
dried things fermented salted dried it

554
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,840
was a survival tactic doesn't mean it's

555
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,159
great doesn't mean it's good but it was

556
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:42,399
a survival method and it became a

557
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,880
commodity on sale for sale for centuries

558
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,320
and an addiction people got addicted to

559
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,919
their sodium to their salt and people

560
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,360
still are now every day it's even in

561
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,520
coffee people don't realize it but they

562
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,720
put a little salt in coffee shops now

563
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,440
you don't know it it's in the machine be

564
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,600
in some places it's in the water in some

565
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,480
places it's there to make the cup of

566
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,559
coffee little salty it all makes it

567
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,000
better but it keeps people addicted and

568
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,919
they go back to their coffee shops there

569
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,320
are people out there that try unsalted

570
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,440
butter but let's face it how good is

571
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,320
that have you had unsalted butter at all

572
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,200
did you ever take a piece of toast take

573
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,840
unsalted butter put it on that piece of

574
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,240
toast and eat it what did it taste like

575
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
not as good as the salted butter now

576
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,360
there's people out there that are back

577
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,120
to the land they're actually churning

578
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,679
their own butter they're raising animals

579
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,520
they're doing it all but guess what they

580
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,240
also have a bag of salt in the kitchen

581
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,679
and they're adding it to their food for

582
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,640
their children and for their husbands

583
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,399
and for their families they're still

584
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:56,399
using salt every single day even if

585
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:59,880
they're not making salted butter the

586
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,480
salt addiction is real but it's okay to

587
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,919
have a little bit of a high quality salt

588
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,760
it's okay to put a little bit on your

589
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,600
food it dilutes it enough it buffers it

590
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,240
enough it's not liver shock like when

591
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,760
you're dumping it in water so people

592
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,799
love their sodium they love their salt

593
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,039
and our bloodstream needs it but what

594
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,960
our bloodstream and our organs really

595
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:27,559
cry for is sodium that's naturally

596
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,679
derived in something like an herb

597
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:34,799
there's a little bit of sodium in fresh

598
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:38,159
herbs cilantro Parsley Sage thyme just a

599
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,440
little bit of sodium in

600
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,559
spirina that's one all on its own

601
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,080
there's a little bit of sodium in barley

602
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:50,200
grass juice powder there's a little bit

603
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,720
of sodium in tomatoes in lemons and

604
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,039
there's a decent amount of sodium in

605
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,159
celery and coconut water when you use

606
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:03,039
these forms of sodium they're bonded

607
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,279
bonded trace minerals that hold out they

608
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,360
become hold outs what does that mean

609
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,880
they stay in the blood stream and they

610
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,399
keep a balance a sodium balance so

611
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,720
somebody doesn't go sodium deficient or

612
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:18,519
sodium overload it keeps the balance for

613
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,360
the neurotransmitters for the building

614
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,080
blocks the electrolytes all of it the

615
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,640
celery that has sodium cluster salts a

616
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,760
subgroup of sodium on top of macro

617
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,159
sodium and then when you make a medical

618
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,279
medium spinach soup it is a powerful

619
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:39,679
healing tool and it's high and naturally

620
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:42,120
derived sodium the kind our bodies need

621
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,120
that's in

622
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,960
spinach I love this treadmill yeah it's

623
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,279
like one of the best technology is

624
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,320
amazing see if you use it this way you

625
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,279
could do a quick run on it uhhuh yeah

626
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,960

know which ones can make people live

658
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:27,760
strong or

659
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,799
fall but Lord Oh Lord can you shine a

660
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,159
light

661
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,120
on the misguided biot tricks that

662
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:40,640
saturate the health information

663
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:43,960
Shores Lord oh Lord help the sick avoid

664
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,600
the jagged rocks that are made up of

665
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,919
egotistical Health slum

666
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,360
Lords an ocean trip turns into a tragic

667
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,279
turn of events when the captain says

668
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,919
there is no fresh water left on the ship

669
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,440
and Baton down the hatches it's time to

670
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,000
drink our urine first to quench our

671
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,799
thirst before we have no choice but to

672
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,600
drink the salty ocean water and as the

673
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:18,519
days go by one by one they sicken and

674
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,519
die for the water with flavor has no

675
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:25,320
place in a man's stomach before the

676
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,120
bowel labors it's all fun to shout out a

677
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,240
salt trick while science backs it up up

678
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,720
with an animal lick which could be

679
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,880
partially okay if the details and the

680
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,320
nuances were known and taught and

681
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:46,639
learned in a certain way and not gone

682
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,679
astray so L and behold it finally makes

683
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:54,919
sense so an unsuspected person doesn't

684
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:58,360
take another blow and get burned and set

685
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:01,919
back while trying to move forward never

686
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,360
always is lost your body is healing and

687
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:09,240
picking back up it tips the scale back
