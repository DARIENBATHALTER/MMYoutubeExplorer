[0.08 - 5.52] We're talking about how the chemtrails
[2.56 - 8.96] kill the birds. Ducks flying at 10,000
[5.52 - 11.92] ft will match a chemtrail plane flying
[8.96 - 15.12] at 10,000 ft. So, simplifying it a
[11.92 - 17.76] little bit, birds fly high, chemtrail
[15.12 - 20.32] planes fly low, birds get caught into
[17.76 - 23.28] the chemtrails themselves and get
[20.32 - 25.28] snuffed out and then die. And we're not
[23.28 - 27.68] just talking about a few birds. We're
[25.28 - 31.20] talking about thousands of birds. tens
[27.68 - 32.96] of thousands in just a flock migrating.
[31.20 - 36.72] We're talking about a massive amount of
[32.96 - 39.44] birds dying close to death almost at
[36.72 - 42.32] exactly the same time. And keep in mind,
[39.44 - 44.16] every batch lot in the plane, every
[42.32 - 45.84] group of chemicals that they have that
[44.16 - 48.08] they're dumping, whether it's
[45.84 - 50.40] geoengineering planes or a chemtrail
[48.08 - 53.76] plane, can be different at any given
[50.40 - 56.08] time. So, some concoctions could be
[53.76 - 58.64] instantly deadly, while some are
[56.08 - 61.04] intoxicating and dangerous enough to
[58.64 - 63.44] weaken the birds, causing their flight
[61.04 - 66.00] pattern to be disturbed, causing them to
[63.44 - 68.40] weaken and have to drop out of the sky,
[66.00 - 71.12] disturbing the process of nature,
[68.40 - 74.64] destroying the very birds we love. So,
[71.12 - 78.52] how do 10,000 birds die at a clip? How
[74.64 - 78.52] does it really happen?
