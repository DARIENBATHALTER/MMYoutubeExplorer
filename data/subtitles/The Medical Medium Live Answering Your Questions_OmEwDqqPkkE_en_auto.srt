remember your body

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,159
wants to heal it's looking to heal

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
and it wants to heal you always have to

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,200
remember that i know that when you're

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,479
going through it

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,200
and you're sick or you've got a symptom

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,960
or a diagnosis and you're struggling

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
and you know you're just in it and

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,880
you're in it for so long right

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,719
i know when that happens that that it

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,119
feels like you're not going to heal

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,880
or it feels like how can i heal i still

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
got these symptoms or my body is

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,520
struggling

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,200
and it feels like you're not going to

61
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
get anywhere with it

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,599
but the truth is your body

63
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,080
wants to heal it just needs to tools to

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,520
heal

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,720
long enough it just needs enough tools

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
in your tool chest to heal long enough

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
meaning

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
it just needs some tools applied and

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
then them

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
used long enough so you can heal

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
it's such an important thing to know

72
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,239
because your body

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
your immune system is working for you

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
it's

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
working for you you just have to support

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
it you have to acknowledge it

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
you wake up in the morning feel like my

78
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,040

you feel like you want to just

194
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,160
run away and scream if you feel

195
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
claustrophobic in a car

whatever's going on and i talk about all

201
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,919
the symptoms in the anxiety show the

202
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
the medical mean podcast but but i'm

203
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
just covering a little bit

204
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
those nerves are inflamed that's one

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
thing that can happen the phrenic nerves

206
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,120
the vagus nerve

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
so that your anxiety nerves right there

208
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,880
you get the nausea with it my god you

209
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
can't get the nausea but that's the

210
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,400
anxiety nerves right there you got the

211
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
vagus nerve you got the phrenic nerves

212
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
right you guys

213
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,520
and anxiety is a neurological condition

214
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
and it's from real things happening you

215
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
know

216
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
two things happening low-grade viral

217
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
issue like having the epsine bar in your

218
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
system all these years

219
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,000
and the epstein-barr can release a

220
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
neurotoxin the neurotoxin swells up the

221
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
vagus nerve and phrenic nerves and then

222
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
you're dealing with mystery anxiety and

223
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,759
you're like oh my

attacks anxiety attacks right

226
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,240
and then also toxic heavy metals can do

227
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,880
it too

228
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
mercury aluminum right mercury and

229
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,919
aluminum we have them in our brain we

230
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
have a monovagus nerve we have a

231
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,039
monophrenic nerve we have them in our

232
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,039
liver and that metal

233
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,880
can also do it too these two things

234
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
toxic heavy metals and viral issues and

235
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
then there's emotional wounds too you

236
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280

broken friendships

245
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,479
losses and then that heats up

246
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
the emotional center of your brain so

247
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,599

center of the brain the emotional core

276
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
okay the emotional center of the brain

277
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
it gets calloused

278
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,640
because it heats up so it's like you get

279
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
told something bad it's like hey

280
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
oh my god what is this wait what ha

281
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
what's going on this is terrible getting

282
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
broken up with wait a minute you

283
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,279
promised this

284
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
i'm having a or having a dispute or

285
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,640
something with a friendship with a

286
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,600
friendship or a friend or whatever it is

287
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,440
whatever gets sent your way or you read

288
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
an email and it's disheartening whatever

289
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,760
happens in your life you

290
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,839
the the brain heats up it heats up right

291
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,640
in the core just starts heating up

292
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,399
and once it starts heating up then

293
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
anything can go wrong and one of the

294
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,279
things that goes wrong is from that

295
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,680
constant heating you can get a little

296
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,080
bit of a wear and tear

297
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,519
on brain tissue on neurons on brain

298
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
cells right in there in the emotional

299
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,080
center of the brain

300
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
and you get a little tiny callous they

301
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
can heal up but

302
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,760
but that's what goes on there i talk

303
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,480
about in detail in the anxiety episode

304
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,480
medical mean podcast at apple podcast um

305
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
clarissa how to get rid of rosacea now

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
you got to learn

307
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,000
what rosacea is for what it's really

308
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
important to know what it is

309
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and what's causing it and all that get a

310
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
little bit of mercury in the intestinal

311
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
tract

312
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
go tell your doctor about that you know

313
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
so they learn but you get a little

314
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,040
he gets a little bit of strep in the

315
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,880
system a little bit of ebv in the system

316
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
so you know what happens is when people

317
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,320
have bacteria and

318
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
and viruses in their body and in their

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
system they'll get the rosacea all over

320
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,399
the place

321
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,959
so that's that's the toxins at surface

322
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,000
um toxic heavy metals are involved with

323
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,200
that too

324
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,760
um i mean if i had rosacea

325
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,279
if i had any kind of rosacea stuff i

326
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,200
would i would do

327
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
probably like three six nine cleanse

328
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
that's what i would do personally i just

329
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,839
put a

330
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
a friend that uh that contacted me with

331
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,200
rosacea and they said how do i get rid

332
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
of my rosacea and i was helping them out

333
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,880
telling them what to do 369 cleanse they

334
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,240
could do the original

335
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,680
or the advanced one if they want um

336
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,519
but you know you can do what you want to

337
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
do and say what you want to do talk to

338
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
your doctor too

339
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
i you know and another thing is if i had

340
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
rosacea i would make sure the gluten

341
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
wasn't there right no gluten

342
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
i would make sure that milk cheese

343
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,079
butter milk

344
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,560
cheese yogurt kefir butter

345
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
sour cream i don't know i can't anything

346
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,120
else i would make sure it's not there

347
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,640
and you know it's gone i would make sure

348
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,640
the eggs weren't there

349
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,320
and i would start thinking about

350
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
bringing in some of the foods that you

351
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
see over there

352
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,000
because i'm inviting you guys over to

353
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,160
dinner to tick-tock live

354
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
i'm going to answer questions thoroughly

355
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,760
and i'm going to be making food so and

356
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,959
it's soon too it's actually

357
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
coming up pretty soon i'm going to go to

358
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
ig and then go to there but

359
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
that's what i would do rosacea is making

360
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,760
sure that there's no there's no

361
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
nutritional yeast

362
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,519
because nutritional yeast will keep

363
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,920
rosacea around i'm not saying you eat it

364
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,120
but it might be in a packaged treat

365
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,480
or it might be something you know that

366
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
you're doing or in a

367
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
in a restaurant dish just look out for

368
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
nutritional yeast

369
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,920
um that's one thing i would would kind

370
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
of keep away from

371
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,120
also kind of if you want another tip

372
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
it's

373
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,000
keeping your fats a little lower just

374
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,880
try not to make your day all about fats

375
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,240
and you know that's all these animal

proteins all day long

377
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,800
or all these plant fats all day long

378
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,399
try not to keep the fat so high you know

379
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,240

medicalmeme.com

417
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,079
uh the directory i got there it's

418
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
definitely the best company ever

419
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,440
i mean it just is do a little b12 right

420
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,680
here

421
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,519
but it's the best company um

422
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,519
for a lot of reasons because they

423
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
actually don't play that game where they

424
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
put

425
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
cheap stuff all the companies put cheap

426
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
most almost every company puts cheap

427
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,160
ingredients in

428
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,959
and they're all about how many pennies

429
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,279
they can

430
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,480
save and then put out this product and

431
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,560
it's really a game

432
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
and it's terrible you know and they put

433
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
other stuff in there and the whole bit

434
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
it's just really a horrible thing this

435
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,519
company doesn't do that

436
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,839
