37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,080
but

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,280
they're not healing us

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,159
they're not healing our body

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000

a little bit of basil

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,959
but it's a filler

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,560
there's so much filler going on

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
that's what people

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
don't understand

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,599
is there so much

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,080
filler going on out there and that's

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,360
where does the healing food come in how

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
do we incorporate the healing foods

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
how do we bring in

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
the healing foods

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
so we can

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,799
bypass all the fillers

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,360
right

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,040

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,360
potatoes aren't a filler

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,480
potatoes aren't

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,480
potatoes are a medicinal food

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
they're a medicinal food it's not a

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,200
filler

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,440
too many beans

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,280

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,640
doesn't mean they're bad

101
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,640
doesn't mean beans are bad

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320

avocados healing

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,639

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,039
anti-vegetarian diet anti-animal protein

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,919
diet now but keep in mind

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,000
if you're gonna be eating your meat it's

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,160
not anti-viral anti-bacterial

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,240
anti-fungal anti-yeast anti-whatever

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
anti-whatever it's not

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,599
it's not

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
it's a filler

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
it's a filler

200
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,240
it doesn't mean

201
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
the meat

202
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,879
is going to

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,960
feed everything bad inside of you i

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,599
never said that someone wants the animal

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,599
protein i would say lower the amount

206
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
but it's

207
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,479
a filler

208
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
the lower says what's a filler

209
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,720
these are fillers that take up space

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,560
very good question dolores thank you

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
very good question these are fillers

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,319
that take up space in our diet and stop

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
us from making room for what making room

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
for what

215
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,560
making room for more leafy greens more

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,520
asparagus more brussels sprouts more

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
kale

218
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,919
more squash more papayas right there

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
more bananas right there more oranges

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,039
right there more zucchinis more

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
everything

222
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,879
right these are just some things

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
i got right here

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,800
so we take seaweed hero exactly less

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,039
filling we take up space

226
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,320
right you want your chicken you want

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
your chicken

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
okay people want their chicken they want

229
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,519

butter they want to eat the butter's

235
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,399
different that's just a heart attack on

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,399
a stick that feeds bugs

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
let's talk about plant-based for a

238
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
second talking about vegans and

239
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,040
plant-based for a second so this is

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
important i just want to say uh to kim

241
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
kim on

242
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,680
rumble hi kim marie

243
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
right

244
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,279
and um i could see your comments

245
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,279
on rumble too

246
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,839
plant-based you could be plant-based and

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
still have fillers everywhere guess what

248
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,920
you can be plant-based and have too many

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,959
avocados

250
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,040
and yes they're healthier

251
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:35,760
they offer more than other fillers

252
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:40,160
avocados offer more than meat filler

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,160
avocado offers more than salmon

254
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
if you're wondering how that lemon stays

255
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,360
on there like that's because it's

256
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
obviously a prop piece of salmon

257
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,880
avocados

258
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,120
have more in them as a filler than

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,120
chicken but you can still play the

260
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,360
filler game with too much avocado and

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,680
too much nuts and seeds

262
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
you can eat as a plant-based person lots

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
of nuts lots of seeds you hear this guys

264
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,800
listen lots of nuts lots of nut butters

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,640
lots of seeds and yeah there's some

266
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
healing properties in nuts and there's

267
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,959
some healing properties in seeds but it

268
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
still takes too much space and can still

269
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,880
make it so a vegan person a plant-based

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,440
person can't heal

271
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,959
because it becomes a filler it becomes a

272
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
filler

273
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,640
and you can be a vegan and eat too many

274
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,279
beans too much rice

275
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
because those are fillers

276
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
oatmeal

277
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
oatmeal for both the animal protein

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
people and the plant-based people i'm

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,760
just telling you now or the vegans and

280
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,680
the animal protein people oatmeal

281
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,519
is a safe grain to eat

282
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,160
but it's a filler

283
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,440
this is such an important topic

284
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,320
it's a filler you guys

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
that's what it is

286
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,279
you can tank on some oatmeal every day

287
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,760
but it's not enough healing properties

288
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,160
in oatmeal oatmeal is not antiviral

289
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,200
antibacterial anti-fungal anti-yeast

290
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,760
anti-everything that's making you sick

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,320
oatmeal doesn't cleanse the poisons and

292
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,000
toxins out of your liver and body

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,680
meat

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,079
is not antiviral

295
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,920
antibacterial anti fungal anti yeast and

296
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,000
meat can't cleanse metals and stuff

that's inside your liver and your body

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,920
it can't cleanse it out

299
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,560
salmon is not antiviral anti and

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,920
antifungal anti yeast antibacterial and

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,079

404
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,720
morning

405
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,600
do something right that takes place of

406
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,399
the fillers but does something for you

407
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,880
don't you want it working for you don't

408
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
you want what you're doing working for

409
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
you you guys

410
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,320
for you

413
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
and so when everybody's doing too much

414
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
filler doesn't mean you're not allowed a

415
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
piece of meat if you're an animal

416
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
protein person doesn't mean you're not

417
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,079
allowed a piece of salmon if you're an

418
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
animal protein person or a piece of

419
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,880
chicken it doesn't mean you're not

420
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,320
allowed doesn't mean as as a plant-based

421
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,839
person you're not allowed all those nuts

422
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,079
and seeds you're not allowed some

423
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
avocados you're not allowed all that it

424
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,880
just means

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
you gotta work

426
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,279
with the miracles that the planet has

427
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,279
and offers

428
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,839
i recommend holding off those animal

429
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
proteins till the end of the day till

430
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
dinner time if you're an animal protein

431
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
person you wait to the end of the day so

432
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,079
you don't take up your day with too many

433
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,680
fillers and then at night if you do your

434
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,399
animal protein at night that's when you

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,399
did a filler

436
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
and i recommend if you're anna if you're

437
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,120
plant-based if you're vegan and you're

438
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
plant-based i recommend

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
you hold off on a lot of the grains and

440
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
a lot of the oatmeal a little bit maybe

441
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,079
you do those two to the end of the day

442
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279
but you you replaced it in the morning

443
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,440
with

444
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
with your smoothies and you got your

445
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,120

485
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,400
help you and turn your life around and

486
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,160
not get caught up in too many of the

487
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
fillers because if you get caught up in

488
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,880
too many into too many of the fillers

489
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,039
you pay the price down the road either

490
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,320
you don't heal or you never heal

491
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,160
completely or you get sicker in some way

492
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,960
and that's what happens and no one

493
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,039
really understands this

494
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,679
this isn't the channel of oh it's either

495
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,640
animal protein or plant-based

496
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,039
no this is the channel of

497
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,360

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,159
here thank you for the comment it's easy

566
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,440
to fill up on fillers

567
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,720
so easy

568
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,799
eggs in the morning filler an egg's not

569
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
going to reverse a condition an egg is

570
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,520
not going to heal you you guys have to

571
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,840
understand this an egg doesn't heal you

572
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,360
th this is critical information for

573
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,159
people out there that are trying to heal

574
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,000
and get their lives back an egg doesn't

575
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
heal you

576
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
at all

577
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:12,159
and red onion helps you heal an egg

578
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,320
helps you get sick it doesn't heal you

579
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,559
i'd rather have you eat avocados than

580
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,240
eggs any day but like i said if you're

581
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
plant-based you could be eating way too

582
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,240
much avocado then it becomes a filler

583
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,840
because avocado does have healing

584
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
properties so i like it better than a

585
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,280
lot of things

586
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,760
but when you dominate your diet with

587
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
avocados all the time it doesn't mean

588
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
we're going to be actually reversing a

589
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
condition so when we have our avocado

590
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,760
toast on gluten-free bread that's great

591
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
and there's some healthy things in

592
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,080
avocado but it's not enough to reverse

593
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,840
our condition and turn our lives around

594
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
it becomes a filler

595
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,480
becomes a filler

596
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,200
an orange is not a filler you make room

597
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,760
for some oranges you're making room the

598
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,840
minute you take away all those fillers

599
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,159
the minute you take away those right

600
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
there

601
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,799
you just open the door

602
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,960
for something to come in

603
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,360
that can turn your life around you just

604
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,559
open the door to the magic of healing

605
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,039
you just open the door to the angelic

606
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,480
healing powers that are around you

607
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,520
angels wanting you to heal

608
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
however

609
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
universe wanting you to heal whatever

610
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
you believe

611
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,000
whatever it is

612
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
that you have around you

613
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,360
you open the door

614
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,840
for healing to happen

615
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,919
when you push back the fillers a little

616
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,600
bit just push them back a little bit you

617
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,280
don't have to push them all the way back

618
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
you're just pushing back a little and

619
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,679
everything starts to change

620
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,679
everything starts to change

621
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
it's incredible

622
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,600
tara said

623
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,840
look on his website the recipe is there

624
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,840
on his page so lots of recipes on

625
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,840
medicalmedium.com

626
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,360
if you're too busy eating pork

627
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,279
so that's a filler right there pork's a

628
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,440
big filler

629
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,679
just letting everybody know right now

630
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,720
when you eat pork

631
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,240
you really hamper your pancreas you hurt

632
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
your liver

633
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
but it's not just that

634
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,039
you have it's a filler

635
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,480
ham pork chops

636
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,240
pulled pork

637
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,400
bacon

638
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,760
bacon is one of those fillers that takes

639
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
up your diet

640
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,640
doesn't give you anything back you get

641
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
nothing back

642
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
it takes away you get nothing back but

643
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,440
it's one of those fillers

644
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
so it's something where if you get rid

645
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,200
of the bacon

646
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,080
you get rid of the ham you just open the

647
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,760
door you bring in those steamed potatoes

648
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,279
you bring in that bring in that kabocha

649
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,840
squash you bring in that butternut

650
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,919
squash you bring in that deli delicata

651
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,679
squash you bring in that red curry

652
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
squash

653
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,559
you can just bring in bring in the

654
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,120
spaghetti squash

655
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,279
but you can bring in different options

656
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,120
bring in the steamed vegetables bring in

657
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,120
the steamed broccoli the steamed

658
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,320
asparagus the steamed brussels sprouts

659
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
you bring these things in

660
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,799
so

661
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,200
jaylon rumble says or ask is egg white

662
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,760
as bad as a yolk it is

663
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,279
it's bad in a different way the yolk has

664
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,400
more fat in it

665
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,400
right

666
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,400
yolk has more fat in it

667
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
okay

668
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,919
all right so that's that's why the yolk

669
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
is is pretty bad

670
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,559
but

671
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,080
but regardless of

672
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,400
whether the egg white or the yolk

673
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
it's all bad because it feeds the bugs

674
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
so let me just show you right here

675
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,240
because i have to show you

676
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,039
okay

677
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,520
so when you eat an egg

678
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,960
it becomes food for these guys in you

679
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,559
yeast mold fungus

680
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,559
viruses

681
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,679
bacteria

682
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,000
feeds

683
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,960
on eggs when you eat the eggs when egg

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,640
particles are floating around your body

685
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
all the bugs

686
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,520
that make you have lupus fibromyalgia

687
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,400
rheumatoid arthritis hashimoto's

688
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,720
thyroiditis neurological lyme

689
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,120
acne eczema psoriasis dizziness vertigo

690
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,559
tinnitus aches and pains

691
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,880
it's these bugs

692
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,640
that feed off of foods like eggs that's

693
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,240
why i don't like eggs as a filler i

694
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
don't like eggs i'd rather have you eat

695
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,679
oatmeal any day if if you were to tell

696
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
me i'm going to either eat eggs or

697
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,440
oatmeal

698
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
and uh and pick and choose the filler

699
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
i'd be like filler filler

700
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,679
lots of oatmeal

701
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,799
doesn't matter if it's a filler

702
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,520
at least the oatmeal won't feed the bugs

703
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
because oatmeal won't feed the viruses

704
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
and the bacteria in the fungus and the

705
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,600
yeast of the mold

706
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,559
oatmeal won't feed that but the eggs

707
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,240
will

708
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,000
that's why i don't like eggs as a filler

709
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,480
eggs is a bad filler that's a bad filler

710
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,159
that's a bad one

711
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,760
the funny thing is is all the vegan

712
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
people and the plant-based people the

713
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,400
minute they get a symptom or they get

714
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,679
sick they run back to eggs first

715
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,039
and then they're just eating eggs and

716
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
they have no idea why they're sick

717
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,159
that's why they're eating eggs and they

718
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,760
have no idea eggs feed

719
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,880
the very viruses and bacteria that are

720
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
making them sick and the yeast in the

721
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,279
fungus and mold but they don't they

722
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
don't know

723
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,559
so all the vegan people and plant-based

724
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,320
people just run back to eggs as fast

725
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,320
they can that's why they don't it's why

726
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,480
they don't really attack eggs i don't

727
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,240
know if you know this

728
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,559
but the vegan world and the plant-based

729
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,840
world they'll attack meat meat eaters

730
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,279
and

731
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,360
they don't really like to say something

732
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,960
about eggs too much because guess what

733
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,960
every month they're having an egg or two

734
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,120
not all of them

735
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,279

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,520
does not cause a flare

753
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,960
will these intolerances go away as i

754
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,960
heal

755
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
well the thing is with ic it's it's like

756
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,880
this okay

757
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,120
i see worsens from foods that you don't

758
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,640
feel any discomfort from

759
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
because i see

760
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
right

761
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,279
is caused by pathogens so that's what i

762
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,640
see is caused with right interstitial

763
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,880
status is caused by pathogens

764
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,360
so these pathogens

765
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,960
they make a home in the bladder the the

766
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,200
urethra uti right the trap the the

767
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,360
urinary tract and they make a home and

768
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,840
that home gets really

769
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,640
patched up and rough

770
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,200
gets beat up in there and so

771
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,559
what happens is that you eat things like

772
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,880
eggs and

773
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,559
your you think your ic is under control

774
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,919
and you eat things like

775
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,159
some meat and you think it's under

776
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,840
control but

777
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
it's okay to eat some meat but it

778
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,120
becomes a filler in your life it's not

779
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,120
opening up the door for something that's

780
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,480
going to heal your ic

781
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,159
what happens is

782
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,399
fruits and that's the question right

783
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,880
there you said fruits why is fruits but

784
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,440
why do fruits bother healthy fruits

785
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
bother some people with ic

786
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,799
it bothers them

787
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,480
because they're raw inside

788
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,720
they're raw inside that urinary tract

789
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,120
they're raw because they got the in

790
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
long-term infections of streptococcus

791
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,799
they got the

792
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
long-term infections of epstein-barr

793
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,399
they got the long-term infections of

794
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,440
bacteria and so it's raw to the bone so

795
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,919
when you put astringency on it when you

796
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,440
start putting something astringent on it

797
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
like some buries

798
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
you're you're eating and the berries go

799
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,080
down or some oranges you're going down

800
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,279
right and then that those berries and

801
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,039
those oranges are detoxing the body and

802
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,919
all that acid that's sitting inside

803
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,000
people's bodies starts to come out along

804
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,000
with the astringent power of some

805
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,159
healing fruits you're going to feel

806
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,919
something with i see but yet that's how

807
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
you heal i see

808
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,000
so i tell people with intracellulitis i

809
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
tell them to take it easy that you do

810
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,760
some bananas that does not

811
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,159
bother at all you do papaya

812
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,200
tell them you do papaya

813
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,679
right there for instastitus

814
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,440
right there papaya

815
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,200
it still gets the acids out you're still

816
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,480
going to have some of that acid burned

817
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,440
from

818
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,880
from all that poison in the body

819
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
but that's one thing you can do

820
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,440
so today i just wanted to run by you

821
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,679
guys a few things

822
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,799
i want to run by

823
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,720
what fillers are you eating

824
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,360
and how can we

825
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,320
slowly move some of those fillers

826
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,399
to a lower level in the diet so we can

827
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,000
get something else in there

828
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,679
how many zucchinis are eating are you

829
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,840
doing steamed zucchinis you can do

830
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
steamed zucchinis you can do steamed

831
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,399
asparagus every day what does i see it's

832
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,399
interstitial cystitis

833
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,399
uh hopefully that's the ic that

834
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,799
they're asking about

835
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,679
maybe you know maybe it's someone can

836
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,440
also make a mistake and and do i see for

837
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,559
incontinence or something or something

838
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,279
else

839
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,360
but it should be that

840
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,320
so you create brown rice

841
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,240
i see that what are you guys eating

842
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,279
if eggs are cooked properly wouldn't it

843
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,760
be

844
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,919
wouldn't it be dead to the virus

845
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,360
no it's it's it's

846
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,320
thresa it's the it's what's in the egg

847
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,440
that the virus feeds on dead or alive

848
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,440
when you eat the egg

849
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,559
it's the undeveloped proteins

850
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,120
in the eggs

851
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,279
undeveloped proteins whether they're

852
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,360
cooked or the raw the undeveloped

853
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,840
protein because the chicken hasn't been

854
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,840
formed yet so when you eat the chicken

855
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
the chicken

856
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
won't feed a virus

857
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,760
a chicken is not anti-viral

858
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,760
anti-bacterial anti-anything no it's

859
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,640
it's not a healing food you can eat it

860
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,320
it's a filler it's a filler but it's not

861
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,360
a healer

862
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,600
chicken

863
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,120
is not a healer

864
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,320
right

865
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,840
eggs the undeveloped protein in eggs

866
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,279
feeds all the

867
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,279
bugs it feeds all the bugs

868
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,480
that that's what happened so when you

869
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,240
eat the egg whether it's alive or cooked

870
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,279
your the bugs in your body are going

871
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,360
whoa whoa food food food now let's get a

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,279
let's cover that for a minute first of

883
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,080
all it's amazing you're having to learn

884
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,360
lemon water first okay so steve

885
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,159
incredible

886
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,600
right

887
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,200
you're moving on to your celery juice

888
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,080
now

889
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,880
boom

890
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,840
you're moving on to your celery juice

891
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,720
that's incredible you're already doing

892
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,159
things that fillers would have replaced

893
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,159
what if you decided just to have your

894
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,919
oatmeal all morning and that was it you

895
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,000
just did a filler in the morning but

896
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,279
what you did you had your filler later

897
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
on

898
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,360
the oatmeal which is not antiviral not

899
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,559
not anti-bacterial

900
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,399
oatmeal is not anti

901
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,159
yeast and mold

902
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,399
but you at least got some powerhouses in

903
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,159
in the morning then you had your filler

904
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,800
that's okay

905
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,159
but what if you

906
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,159
you got a few powerhouses you got the

907
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,879
heavy metal detox then the oatmeal so

908
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,879
you got you got a few weapons in there

909
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,040
of healing and then you did the then you

910
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,720
did the filler later that's what it is

911
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,839
that's your morning that's great but can

912
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,919
you imagine

913
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,879
if you did that

914
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,879
right

915
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,320
and then you did potatoes maybe for

916
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,240
lunch like some steamed potatoes because

917
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,919
potatoes aren't filler they're antiviral

918
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,839
still they're anti-bacterial they're the

919
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,240
anti-yeast and the anti-anti-mold what

920
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,000
if you did avocados with one of the

921
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,800
medical medium recipes what if you did

922
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
it with some cilantro what if you did

923
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,639
with any avocados potatoes what if you

924
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
did your potatoes with cilantro what if

925
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,159
you did your potatoes spirit cracked at

926
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,359
me that time spirit of compassion

927
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,960
corrected me

928
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,320
what if you did

929
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,960
some kale

930
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,520
would have did some leafy greens right

931
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,240
and then you did the oatmeal later on in

932
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,040
the end of the day or later on in the

933
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,800
afternoon you just did more more healing

934
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,200
foods more healing foods and then you

935
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,640
did your filler even later

936
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,760
and later

937
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,240
and what if

938
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,119
at dinner time you did steamed asparagus

939
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,800
steamed brussels sprouts more greens

940
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,280
some tomatoes

941
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,040
all of that

942
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,800
and maybe threw a half an avocado on

943
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
there too

944
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,800
which is the best of all the fillers

945
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
maybe you had some winter squash

946
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,680
and you did all that and then you didn't

947
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
do your oatmeal

948
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,520
literally you just avoided a whole day

949
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,119
of fillers

950
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,720
but i'm not saying everybody has to do

951
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
that

952
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,480
okay

953
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,040
so on tick tock i'm asked where do we

954
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,839
get our protein

955
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,200
check out the brainwashed

956
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,359
okay by protein on rumble check it out

957
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,800
right protein

958
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
that's a head scratcher for me so let's

959
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,839
talk about protein a little bit because

960
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
that's that's gonna that's gonna have

961
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,040
everybody thinking

962
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,200
where you gotta check out that protein

963
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,160
episode on rumble you gotta check that

964
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,000
out you guys the one i did

965
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,720
protein

966
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,480
does not heal right it's not an

967
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,440
antiviral thing it's not an

968
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,079
antibacterial thing protein doesn't heal

969
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,079
the body

970
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,000
you know i'm scratching my head if

971
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,839
protein means everything and protein

972
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,760
heals everything

973
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,280
why is the whole world sick and they're

974
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800
all on protein they're just they're

975
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,079

tick-tock they're loaded with

977
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,880
everybody's eating protein protein is it

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,720
is everywhere everybody's diet's loaded

979
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
with protein you can have bacon every

980
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,599
morning all that protein

981
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,440
you can have

982
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,200
pork chops and bacon and meat you can

983
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
eat anything eggs you can have protein

984
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,000
all day long

985
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,480
but the hospitals are filled the

986
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,160
hospitals are filled everybody's getting

987
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,760
sick protein doesn't stop people from

988
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,359
getting sick proteins not saving

989
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,720
everybody's life

990
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,880
everybody's eating protein but

991
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,440
everybody's sick protein doesn't have

992
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,040
antioxidants it doesn't have glucose it

993
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
doesn't have trace mineral salts doesn't

994
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,400
have phytochemical compounds doesn't

995
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,160
have antiviral compounds doesn't have

996
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,640
antibacterial compounds doesn't have

997
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,599
anthocyanins it doesn't have

998
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,560
doesn't have anything

999
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,880
so

1000
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,280
how come protein doesn't michelle l that

1001
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,000
word triggers you protein

1002
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,720
juan says if we are into building muscle

1003
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,040
what else can we eat with medical medium

1004
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,400
i want to heal but not lose so much

1005
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,520
muscle

1006
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,119
one

1007
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,440
what keeps your muscles on is calories

1008
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,000
calories

1009
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,640
that's what keeps your muscles on

1010
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,720
it's calories and trace mineral salts

1011
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,079
that's what keeps muscle on

1012
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,000
if you take away your carbohydrates

1013
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,599
if you you should check out frogman on

1014
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,760
instagram

1015
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,760
juan check out frogman on instagram

1016
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,880
he builds muscle

1017
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,839
you can build muscle with fruits

1018
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,240
vegetables herbs leafy greens potatoes

1019
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,240
all that it's it's about mineral salts

1020
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,520
and calories that's how we build our

1021
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,480
muscle

1022
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,480
protein doesn't build our muscle

1023
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,040
i told the story on rumble you got to

1024
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,200
see the rumble on protein honestly

1025
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,000
watch the rumble episode about protein

1026
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,640
you're minorly blown i talk about

1027
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,640
a study they did

1028
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,079
on people

1029
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,920
that murdered a hundred people

1030
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,680
it murdered a hundred people they

1031
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,760
couldn't get out of the study

1032
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,760
and they had to sit there and starve to

1033
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,160
death and die

1034
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,880
because all they fed them

1035
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,560
was protein isolated protein they took

1036
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,520
the calorie out they took the

1037
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,000
carbohydrate out

1038
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,920
they took the fat out

1039
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,680
and because there wasn't even fat in

1040
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,359
there and they separated the protein

1041
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,280
from the fat they separated the protein

1042
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,560
from the calories they separated the

1043
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,480
protein from the carbohydrate they

1044
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,720
separated the protein from everything

1045
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,960
everybody sat in there for a couple of

1046
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,040
months

1047
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,200
until they died

1048
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,200
they wasted away as if they were in a

1049
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,880
concentration camp and they couldn't

1050
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,640
back out because the study was years ago

1051
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,920
right now you can back out of a study

1052
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,240
now if you become part of a test study

1053
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,400
of some kind now there is a clause in

1054
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,920
the contract that says if you start

1055
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
getting really ill or start falling

1056
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,359
apart or something happens to you you

1057
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,839
can leave

1058
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,880
but back then

1059
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,880
60 years ago

1060
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,119
okay

1061
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,200
60 years ago 70 years ago you couldn't

1062
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,400
leave the study you signed your life

1063
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
away

1064
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,320
and then 100 people watched each other

1065
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,960
die and some of them started eating

1066
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,119
other people some people died in there

1067
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,240
and others were actually eating

1068
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,240
other people in there

1069
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,440
and that's what happens when you feed

1070
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,720
somebody just protein and you take out

1071
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,839
the carbohydrate because the

1072
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,440
carbohydrate is how the muscle stays

1073
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,280
stay strong

1074
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,680
take all carbohydrates away from a

1075
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,160
bodybuilder take them all away

1076
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,480
what do you think bulking and cutting is

1077
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,200
bulking and cutting they end up eating

1078
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,880
all this carbohydrate with fat but they

1079
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,480
end up eating all this carbohydrate all

1080
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
this carbohydrate and they bulk up and

1081
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,599
they bulk up and they're doing the

1082
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,440
weights and they're bulking up bulking

1083
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,440
up and then they have to cut their

1084
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,440
calories back again it hopes to lose the

1085
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,040
fat but keep the muscle it's a game they

1086
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
try to survive with it's bulking and

1087
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,319
cutting bulk up eat more carbohydrate

1088
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,079
eat more carbohydrate eat more

1089
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,839
carbohydrate and then you're bulking up

1090
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,520
you're bulking up you're bulking up and

1091
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,839
then you're really fat because you ate

1092
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,920
carbohydrates with fats combined so

1093
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,440
you've got fat and muscly so then they

1094
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,200
go well i don't like the way i look i

1095
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,440
look too fat even though i got lots of

1096
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
muscle so i better i better now cut my

1097
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,640
calories down cut my calories down and

1098
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
then they try to shed the fat but keep

1099
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
the muscle it's a game it's called

1100
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,000
bulking and cutting but what they don't

1101
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,319
understand is you don't do the fat so

1102
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,400
much you bulk up on the carbohydrates

1103
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,760
and you work out and boom you got

1104
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
muscles and you're not as fat

1105
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,520
look

1106
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,680
you can be an animal protein person you

1107
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,839
can be a plant-based person

1108
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,640
and i'm not telling you no

1109
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,800
you can't eat that meat no you can't eat

1110
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,720
that salmon no you can't eat that

1111
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,520
chicken if you're plant-based no you

1112
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,280
can't eat those nuts and seeds no no no

1113
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,680
i'm not saying that

1114
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,640
what i'm saying is

1115
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,680
where's your medicine

1116
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,680
because it ain't chicken

1117
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,040
and it ain't a whole bunch of nuts and

1118
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,119
seeds and nut butters and oils

1119
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,680
that's not medicine

1120
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,240
it's not medicine enough

1121
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,400
your medicine is not bacon

1122
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,800
your medicine's not eggs

1123
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,359

you're ever down on your hands and knees

1129
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,200
begging for god to help

1130
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,440
you know the whole thing is

1131
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,000
i've run into so many people over the

1132
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,000
years and i've helped

1133
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,240
tens and tens of thousands of people

1134
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,960
throughout the years right 35 years

1135
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,960
of helping people get their lives back

1136
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,319
and then the medical medium book series

1137
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,119
right here if you don't have liver

1138
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,400
rescue take advantage of the 53 off or

1139
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,000
get it free at the library if you have

1140
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,960
to get it free at the library i don't

1141
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,240
care

1142
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,319
right now it's not going to help me if

1143
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,720
you buy liver rescue because it costs

1144
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,720
more to print it

1145
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,440
but the point is

1146
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,599
as you go to if you have these books you

1147
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,520
can arm yourself with information and

1148
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,280
the point i'm trying to say is

1149
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,319
right

1150
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,319
out of

1151
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,040
all the years

1152
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,160
and the people that i've watched that

1153
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,960
have been just

1154
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
sick and so sick i've seen people that

1155
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,720
weren't religious

1156
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,800
weren't religious on any level

1157
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,040
i didn't even believe in god which is

1158
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,200
fine you can believe in god you don't

1159
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,760
believe in god it doesn't matter to me

1160
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,720
i don't judge anybody for anything

1161
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,319
but

1162
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,079

all

1164
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,760
that no way god exists and then they get

1165
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,440

crawled up the shore and we became a

1259
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,240
lizard

1260
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:37,200

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,640
and then the possum

1263
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,000
possum grew into uh

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,440
a bear

1265
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,839

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,920
you want at least enough in the freezer

1305
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,400
so keep that in mind so you can freeze

1306
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,880
fruit you can freeze bananas i got a lot

1307
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,559
of bananas in my freezer a lot of frozen

1308
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,720
bananas

1309
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,319
that's something you can do right

1310
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,760
and one day i'll talk about a whole list

1311
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,880
i'll do a rumble with a whole list of

1312
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,680
different stuff

1313
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,359
or do an amazon live or something

1314
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,119
you know and we'll do that okay we'll do

1315
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,720
maybe we'll do an amazon live and

1316
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,880
because we can make stuff too and

1317
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,720
everything else will be fun right

1318
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,200
but anyway just want to let you guys

1319
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,680
know about that book though it's 51 off

1320
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,920
amazon.com us

1321
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,920
right

1322
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
question on rumble why do they say if

1323
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,280
you have a cold or fluid chicken soup

1324
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,599
because it's soup it's lighter

1325
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,440
it's lighter

1326
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,000
they don't tell you to eat it

1327
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,280
thanksgiving dinner because somewhere

1328
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,280
along the line somebody figured it out

1329
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,280
that if you eat too much when you're

1330
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,599
sick with the flu and you can't eat

1331
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,720
anything you just vomited you got

1332
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,319
diarrhea you got a high fever the last

1333
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,920
thing you need is a big old turkey wedge

1334
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:21,839
sub or a big old meatball grinder or a

1335
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,079
big old philly cheesesteak sandwich or

1336
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,480
when you got the flu you don't need a

1337
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,720
pizza when you got the flu because when

1338
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,800
you got the flu and you go eat a big old

1339
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,880
pizza pie your butt's going to be

1340
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,960
probably cranking that fever higher than

1341
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,359
it was to begin with it was 102 fever

1342
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,640
it's going to be 104 by the night's over

1343
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,520
so what they found out was you eat light

1344
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,079
you eat light when you have the flu and

1345
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,079
since people can't give up chicken who

1346
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,599
love chicken it's better to just have a

1347
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,800
little chicken in the soup and then

1348
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,680
you're sipping all the vegetables

1349
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,760

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,839
do a lot of parsley you can do you can

1654
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,760

lettuce too if you want maybe some kale

1656
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,680
and then you throw all that avocado on

1657
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,280

1667
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,520
you just made a medicine ball

1668
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,040
in your salad

1669
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,839
a medicine ball that's what you did

1670
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,839
that's what you did

1671
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,760
you made a medicine ball

1672
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,760
right

1673
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,599
so keep that in mind

1674
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,599
so let's go into a little bit of kale

1675
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,400
right

1676
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,720
you love your avocado

1677
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,520
put a little bit in your kale then

1678
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,359
but get your leafy greens in you now if

1679
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,680
you want to heal and you got a serious

1680
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:49,359
condition there's ways to heal and you

1681
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,720
keep the avocado out and you keep the

1682
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,760
meat out and you keep whatever out and

1683
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,480
that's a good question right now let's

1684
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,480
talk about that let's talk about meat

1685
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,799
okay

1686
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,000
you love your chicken

1687
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:04,720
put a little bit of chicken

1688
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,480
on a bed of herb

1689
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,319
a bed of herb

1690
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,319
you love your chicken

1691
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,200
make sure you're eating enough herb with

1692
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,280
it

1693
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,599
have that at the end of the day you love

1694
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,880
your meat or salmon

1695
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:21,359
make sure you have it with a lot of herb

1696
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,359
throw some radishes in there

1697
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:25,280
get the medicine in because you gotta

1698
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,039
balance the filler

1699
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,599
now when it comes to healing though

1700
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,760
healing deep seeded stuff that's still

1701
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,359
gonna get in the way the avocado still

1702
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,559
can get in the way if there's too much

1703
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:37,680
in your diet

1704
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,920
but the point is is you're balancing

1705
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,480
the filler you're actually you're

1706
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,400
actually tipping the scale the better

1707
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,640
direction

1708
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,880
you want to have your grass-fed beef

1709
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,280
pieces in a salad you put them on top of

1710
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,440
some parsley and some cilantro and some

1711
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,839
kale and you get that green in you so

1712
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:59,039
that it can help to kind of

1713
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:02,359
mediate the filler

1714
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,359
the filler

1715
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,760
and that's the way to do it

1716
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,160
you can do so much with steamed

1717
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,000
vegetables on greens you can take

1718
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,680
asparagus brussels sprouts you can take

1719
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,079
squash you can take these beautiful

1720
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,960
kabocha squashes right here look at that

1721
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,960
you can take these

1722
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,160
and you can steam these up

1723
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,599
and it's unbelievable and you chop all

1724
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,599
that up and all these steamed vegetables

1725
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,880
and you put the kombucha squash on top

1726
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,119
of your greens and that's not a filler

1727
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,599
that's medicine your squashes are

1728
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,280
anti-viral anti-pathogen anti-bug

1729
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,680
anti-this anti-that they're

1730
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,920
anti-everything that's bad for you and

1731
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,480
that's what these squashes are and that

1732
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,720
that when you think about that whoa

1733
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,760
whoa

1734
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,359
you feel like you want to have a coffee

1735
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,880
get a bunch of oranges out cut them up

1736
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:01,119
squeeze the juice out of them get a nice

1737
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,680
fresh orange juice down

1738
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,680
replace that coffee one time see what

1739
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,200
happens see what clicks in see what

1740
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,640
happens

1741
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,760
right

1742
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,240
carlene says i can't get organic veggies

1743
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,599
are conventional really bad

1744
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,280
no they're not really bad

1745
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,960
if you can't get organic you get

1746
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,720
conventional now i'm gonna get the crap

1747
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,240
eat out of me for that by somebody

1748
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,160
because someone's that's when they all

1749
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,559
get mad everybody gets mad and they say

1750
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,559
no medical medium tells everybody to eat

1751
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,319
the dirty dozen medical medium tells

1752
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,200
everybody to eat the bad pesticides

1753
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,559
medical medium no you can definitely do

1754
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,079
that i would do that in a second you

1755
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,440
think you think that the fruits and

1756
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,039
vegetables i'm eating every day are all

1757
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,760

1758
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,680
you think so no

1759
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,920
because you know why

1760
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:50,000
because the medicine in the fruits and

1761
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,559
vegetables you just gotta wash them good

1762
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,200
the medicine in them outweigh they

1763
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,839
detoxify what's in that vegetable or

1764
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,599
