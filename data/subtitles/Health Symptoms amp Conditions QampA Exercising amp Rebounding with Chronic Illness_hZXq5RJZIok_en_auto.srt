first month anniversary on Tick Tock

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,120

registered dietitian School you and

Daddy have been really so helpful

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,960
I know my Tick Tock page is growing I

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,519
talk about protein

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
uh-huh

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,859
yeah I know Mommy I know Mom I know

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,920
protein is like the most important thing

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,600
ever it's why I became a dietitian

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,040
uh-huh

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,500
yeah

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,420
okay I have to go to work I think I'm

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,420
going live on Tick Tock right now

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,640
okay bye

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,940
love you

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,760
okay so as I was saying before

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,699
this has protein in it and this is this

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,120
is meat and it has protein in it are

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,399
these here I have to say that Rd here

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,080
because it's really important when I

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,720
graduated from registered dietitian

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,619
school they gave us all this for our

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
class

28
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,020
and they said that you have to learn how

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,240
to identify when someone's protein

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,159
deficient or they're not protein

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,360
deficient and you can do that by looking

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,439
at this scientific measuring tool that

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,100
they gave us

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,740
at dietitian school and they got like

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,939
I think my dietitian stuff is really

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,860
paying off on tick tock and I okay

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,780
come down

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay so

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,820
this is a measuring tool to show how

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,220
much protein one is getting and and

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,640
dietitian School were taught that it all

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,560
depends like your facial structure and

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,360
everything

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,740
determines how much protein you actually

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,740
receive

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,600
and how much B12

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,939
I can't believe how much I learned about

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
B12 and registered dietitian school they

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,040
said that only the meat eaters can have

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,960
B12 and get B12

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,000
B12

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,660
okay

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,700
um

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,920
this is really important that I want

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,420
everybody to know on my Tick Tock page I

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
can't wait to make small videos out of

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,340
this on my Tick Tock page

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,680
oh my God like cheese

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,260
I want you to know that it's so

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,560
important it's a staple that every girl

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,440
should be on yes

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,620
um how old am I I just saw a comment I'm

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,080
24 years old and yes I just graduated

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,480
from registered dietitian school I want

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,080
to go into how cheese is so important I

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,660
have I have four ounces of cheese per

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,860
day and in The dietitian handbook guide

68
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,680
where is it

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,940
I've been doing this now for I guess a

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,879
couple of months I just graduate

71
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,599
graduate Grant I think

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,060
I have my handbook guide right here that

73
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,420
they gave us at The dietitian School

74
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,819
Rd here I know right

75
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,940
and they say that cheese is

76
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,700
fundamentally one of the most important

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,220
things that you can actually get in you

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,040
exactly a whole bunch of us graduated

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,440
and we're killing it on Tick Tock now

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,420
so cheese is probably one of the better

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
things sorry I got a phone call coming

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
in

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,739
you see

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,120
hold on

85
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,980
hi

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,540
yeah now I I know I'm in alive I know

87
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,040
Todd

88
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,680
Todd

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,560
I know I thank you for being so

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,060
supportive okay I'll see you later okay

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,739
that's just my boyfriend just don't

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,500
worry

93
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,900
his family had celiac

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
and they're all like Celiac people his

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,360
whole family his mother has Celiac is

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,819
Dad has Celiac and he says he has Celiac

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,159
and I told him that you have to get as

98
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,180
many eggs in you as possible and as much

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,280
cheese and he's on an 100 egg diet an

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,080
egg white diet right now and so I've

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,379
been really helping my boyfriend and his

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,060
family with their Celiac now I what I

103
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,180
really like is chicken

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,940
I eat chicken three times a day every

105
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,500
day for the protein chicken's the most

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,460
important and I just want to say one

107
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,100
more thing

108
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,020
that's really really important is that I

109
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,020
don't want anyone to think that they

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,699
can't indulge because I've noticed that

111
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,340
there's Eating Disorders out there being

112
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,800
started by people who have like they

113
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,160
think they've run the gamut in social

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,380
media and they actually they actually

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,720
like tell people to stay away from so

116
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,639
many things but you have to treat

117
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,960
yourself because it's called moderation

118
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:55,259
and balance and so what I recommend is

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,199
some chocolate cake once in a while or

120
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,240
you have an eating disorder and so I'm

121
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,100
just telling you I learned a lot from my

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
dietitian school and I have a lot of

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,300
experience too because you know when I

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,580
put in my resume now that I've been

125
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,160
doing this since I was like 11 years old

126
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,340
I was telling my mom what she should eat

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,740
or not eat I have so much experience and

128
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,660
what I did was on my website now in my

129
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,419
Tick Tock handle I talk about how I've

130
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,759
been doing this for like 10 years

131
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,340
even though I'm 24 years old I've been

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,860
doing this for 10 years and I'm so

133
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,419
accomplished and I went to school and

134
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,180
dietitian school I just want to show you

135
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:36,360
what happens with this tool here this is

136
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,620
a tool you when you graduate they give

137
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,840
every single Rd there this very tool it

138
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,259
determines how much protein how many

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,240
carbs if you have too many carbs it

140
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,840
changes the structure of your face if

141
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,479
you have two not enough protein it

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,520
changes the structure of your face and

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,720
you can get really sick and protein

144
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,479
deficient

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,100
I think that's it for this

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:08,039
episode of Samantha Samantha's Rd

147
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,360
channel on Tick Tock

148
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,060
um there's so many of us out there

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,300
fighting for people and getting benefits

150
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,340
to them I think um anyway thank you so

151
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:23,120
much I have to take a phone call now I'm

152
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,120
so busy I'm a busy Rd and I have to go

153
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,020
foreign

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,940
anyway we're talking about neurological

155
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,720
symptoms today you guys we're going to

156
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,180
cover tingles numbness aches pains

157
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,400
different kind of neuro symptoms even

158
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,039
touch upon migraines neurological

159
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,800
migraines we're going to touch upon a

160
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,160
lot of the different Tremors shakes

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,900
ticks spasms cranial nerves which is

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,639
really important too you got cranial

163
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,039
nerves that really affect everybody in

164
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,020
so many ways try geminal neuralgia

165
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,460
all kinds of different problems people

166
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,919
are up against

167
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,080
and so I think it's really smart to

168
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,180
touch upon neurological symptoms I want

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,039
to do a little q a stuff too so I want

170
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,800
to be open to that as well

171
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,780
and so I want to begin with is what

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
happens is that

173
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,800
practitioners

174
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,780
and doctors people in the health

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
movement

176
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,960
never ever connected the dots between a

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,639
symptom being neurological if you're

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,620
somebody that's experienced enough in

179
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,599
the last 10 years 15 years maybe you've

180
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,039
been sick 20 years in your life

181
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,199
and you've been sick with different

182
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,259
neurological symptoms you probably went

183
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,340
through the whole guessing games Channel

184
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,720
seeing a lot of different professionals

185
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,300
and health professionals a lot of

186
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,699
different doctors and as it's happening

187
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,580
none of them knew that your symptom was

188
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,339
actually neurological not even believe

189
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,940
it or not like panic attacks back then

190
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,459
10 years ago or more a panic attack was

191
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,620
never considered to be neuro or

192
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:43,020
Neurological on any level and this is

193
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,060
important to know because now that the

194
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,279
time is changing things are changing now

195
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,899
and what's happening is people are

196
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,480
realizing through medical medium books

197
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,700
and medical meme information because it

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,019
was being put out there through these

199
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,700
books about how neurological symptoms

200
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,140
like give you all of these different

201
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,720
things like we feel these different

202
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,320
things from cranial symptoms cranial

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,580
nerves to vagus nerves to all kinds of

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
different things so I want to cover that

205
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,080
right now a little q a how many people

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,240
go through tightness of the chest

207
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,700
and it's unexplainable they have this

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,279
tightness of the chest going on kindness

209
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,779
of the throat kindness of the chest how

210
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,580
many people have ever gone through that

211
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:25,500
they feel like they can't get a deep

212
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,779
breath and they're having a problem

213
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,000
getting a deep breath right so that's

214
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,000
actually Vegas nerve related stuff if

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,620
your doctor rules out everything that

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,240
they are looking for if they're looking

217
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,920
for something and they rule it out and

218
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,920
they're like look you got anxiety let's

219
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,399
put you on some benzos let's send you

220
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,160
home with a benzo you can take an Ativan

221
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,779
a Xanax whatever it is and they send you

222
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,360
home with that and they're like do this

223
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,000
for a while see how your anxiety gets

224
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,860
see how your Panic gets see how your

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
tightness of your chest is in the whole

226
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,640
bit right and they rule out pretty much

227
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
everything else they do blood work they

228
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,480
look at you but they can't release

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
everybody's saying yes right there

230
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,019
exactly that's what you have lately too

231
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm seeing all that

232
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:14,060
so what is missed in the health world

233
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,060
it's a big deal

234
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,740
vagus nerve issues now you'll hear more

235
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,080
about vagus nerve issues now a day right

236
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,720
you'll hear more about it but what

237
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,540
people don't realize is why do we get

238
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,700
symptoms that are vagus nerve related

239
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,380
why and how how does it even happen so

240
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,500
what medical mean information brought

241
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,100
into town years ago was that nerves

242
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,200
swell nerves actually swell they become

243
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,800
inflamed there's a reason why they

244
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,660
become mysteriously inflamed when you

245
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,959
haven't had an accident or an actual

246
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,140
physical injury or anything like that

247
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:58,440
there's a reason why nerves get

248
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:03,060
mysteriously inflamed and that's viruses

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,160
viruses such as Epstein-Barr being one

250
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,040
of the leaders everybody's got

251
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,920
Epstein-Barr at this point in the world

252
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,360
spreading fast but it's not just about

253
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,519
everybody's got Epstein-Barr you know

254
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,399
everybody's got Epstein-Barr 80 in just

255
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,920
about that it's everybody's getting more

256
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,959
than one variety of Epstein-Barr and

257
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
that's what's happening out there so

258
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,260
it's like there isn't just one

259
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,079
Epstein-Barr that means if you have

260
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,140
Epstein-Barr you can't get Epstein-Barr

261
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,019
again that's not true you can have one

262
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,180
Epstein-Barr and get another

263
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,800
Epstein-Barr and get another

264
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,579
Epstein-Barr and get another and another

265
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,899
and another all different varieties some

266
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,779
Milder

267
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,760
some more annoying some more aggressive

268
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,180
but you can get a lot of different

269
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,540
varieties of these viruses and these

270
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,480
viruses release something I call a

271
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,540
neurotoxin it's when the virus eats

272
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,579
something it really likes

273
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,920
like an egg

274
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:10,019
and then peas and poos

275
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,899
waste out of the virus

276
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,959
that floats around your body and is

277
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,980
highly highly allergenic to the vagus

278
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,420
nerves

279
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,339
right there

280
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,800
one of the most important things you can

281
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,339
learn to empower yourself

282
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,720
is vagus nerves swelling getting

283
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,200
inflamed

284
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,620
because there's something toxic a

285
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,300
neurotoxic compound that's saturating

286
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,000
the nerve

287
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,920
that's touching the nerves creating them

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,120
to spasm

289
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,899
creating them to twist a little creating

290
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,519
them to swell and get more inflamed and

291
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,320
this leads

292
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,880
to a lot of different symptoms and

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,139
conditions people are suffering with

294
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:01,980
okay from intestinal tract pain

295
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:05,100
stomach problems intestinal tract pain

296
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:08,399
okay that alone because the vagus nerves

297
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,700
are inflamed to tremors

298
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,760
to spasms and ticks

299
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,500
to tingles and numbness on the body

300
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,779
and not just the Vegas there was getting

301
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,779
inflamed but the phrenic nerves that run

302
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,240
down each side of the chest here

303
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,220
the the phrenic nerves can get inflamed

304
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,079
and swell too which give people a lot of

305
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,700
different issues as well both the

306
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,440
phrenic nerves and vagus nerves can

307
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,980
inflame Korean tightness of the chest

308
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,620
that's unexplainable by any physician or

309
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,899
any doctor out there mystery symptoms

310
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,180
that are plaguing people out there all

311
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:46,019
the time

312
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,399
and so what is critical to know is that

313
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,500
people walk around with lots of

314
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,959
different bugs in them different viruses

315
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,120
now the thing is here is that the health

316
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,279
movement years ago you could even hear a

317
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,800
word like nobody even knew virus what do

318
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,200
you mean what does that even mean no one

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,180
talked about it didn't exist

320
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,920
in the Natural Health move it it was

321
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,380
just about eat better stuff eat better

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,720
books eat better this it was about how

323
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,139
wheat was genetically altered

324
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,820
that wheat was hybridized that wheat has

325
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,339
changed in this world that was pretty

326
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,040
much all you can actually get back years

327
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,500
just more a little over 10 years ago was

328
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,700
just wheat's genetically altered Wheats

329
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,120
hybridized wheat's causing our problems

330
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,040
gluten is causing our problems no no

331
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,660
information on how gluten is causing our

332
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,279
problems on any level

333
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,139
but that's what you would get you would

334
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,579
get eat better books to stay away from

335
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,820
processed foods

336
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,440
to stay away from fried greasy foods and

337
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,199
that's what was given to us pretty much

338
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,600
all around that's all you can do it's

339
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,420
like years ago you got sick

340
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,459
it was like well maybe it was that fast

341
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,320
food diet doing it maybe it's just

342
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,220
hybridized wheat I've been eating every

343
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,779
day

344
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,820
in this gluten

345
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,519
but that's pretty much as far as it went

346
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,279
and then you had millions of people on

347
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,079
the planet suffering with all kinds of

348
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,760
symptoms conditions including thyroid

349
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,440
conditions many of you guys got thyroid

350
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,920
problems right doctors checking out your

351
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,440
thyroid your numbers don't look good

352
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,540
and they're like Hashimoto's all of it

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,300
and then there's the mystery symptoms

354
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,820
the fatigue so I want to go into that a

355
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,240
little bit too when someone has a viral

356
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,940
load and that viral load is feeding on

357
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,620
what it wants like say eggs and cheese

358
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,839
and dairy I'm just showing you a little

359
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,019
bit here in that viral load

360
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,899
is getting high because

361
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:43,260
a virus is feeding off of eggs

362
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,940
and devouring the eggs

363
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,180
and then releasing neurotoxins

364
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:51,180
neurotoxins are flooding the entire body

365
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,100
and then the vagus nerves swell up

366
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,920
and now we're in fatigue where we feel

367
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,860
like we have sandbags for arms we feel

368
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,079
like we have sandbags for legs we have a

369
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,560
hard time getting out of bed we have

370
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,060
what medical mean information States as

371
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,100
neurological fatigue

372
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,779
so I know that so many of you guys have

373
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,120
dealt with neurological fatigue out

374
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,339
there where it doesn't make sense why

375
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,139
are you tired someone will be like

376
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,820
you're lazy and back years ago it was

377
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,880
like you're lazy

378
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,040
you're you're bored you just want to be

379
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
on the couch you don't want to get out

380
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,579
of bed

381
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,740
you're just this is just who you are and

382
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,560
people took the hit every day day in and

383
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,019
day out for their neurological fatigue

384
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,760
but what's really happening is you got

385
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,240
the viral infections the viral

386
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,399
infections are releasing all of these

387
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,920
different neurotoxins including some

388
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,480
neurotoxins the neurotoxins are landing

389
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
on the nerves

390
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,500
in the body and when they land on the

391
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
nerves

392
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,920
they swell and inflame the nerve very

393
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,259
important to know because if you don't

394
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,779
have answers you're lost you're in the

395
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,060
dark you're searching the web

396
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,740
you're checking through social and

397
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,319
you're trying this and trying that and

398
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,540
doing this and doing that when the

399
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,160
answers aren't even clear to why you're

400
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,000
even struggling or suffering on any

401
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,679
level

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
so I want to get into the brain a little

403
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,760
bit the brain stem

404
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,900
the vagus nerves come out of your brain

405
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,299
stem

406
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,880
so do other nerves too like trigeminal

407
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:26,939
nerves many people you guys might be

408
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,440
dealing with this is nerve problems in

409
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,700
the neck in the jaw in the face facial

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,620
nerves

411
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,260
nerves

412
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,240
right around the temple

413
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,640
nerves around the eyes

414
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,200
nerves in the back of the neck back of

415
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,120
the head

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,059
so you're dealing with cranial nerves

417
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,980
facial nerves that are inflamed

418
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,080
trigeminal nerves that are inflamed all

419
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,700
from different viruses and viral

420
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,559
infections so I want to get into that a

421
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,000
little deeper we'll leave Epstein-Barr

422
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,760
for the moment we'll pop back into it

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,620
let's head into the shingles virus

424
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,620
the shingles virus

425
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,880
is growing fast out there more and more

426
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,220
people are getting different varieties

427
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,900
of shingles they're wreaking havoc and

428
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,360
one of the things the shingles virus

429
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,000
does is create trigeminal neuralgia

430
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,039
facial nerve problems and different

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,559
symptoms people get where your teeth

432
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,200
hurt really bad your teeth hurt really

433
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,880
bad your jaw hurts really bad you're

434
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,220
going to the dentist over and over again

435
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,380
you can't really get answers they're

436
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,179
drilling your teeth they're doing root

437
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,160
canals or maybe they're just pulling

438
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,320
teeth because it gets so bad you're on

439
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,820
medications you're struggling you're on

440
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
gabapentin

441
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,020
because that's what they put everybody

442
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,940
on when you have jaw pain neck pain and

443
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,419
it's unexplainable and you're struggling

444
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,059
so much they throw you on gabapentin

445
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,980
right so many people have been on that

446
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,660
and I'm not saying don't be on it or be

447
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
on it and just do what your doctor you

448
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,200
know what's right by you and your doctor

449
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,179
of course your doctor's guidance

450
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,260
but so many people are giving so many

451
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,700
medications like gabapentin and benzos

452
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,140
to try to help them with the

453
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,780
neurological pain

454
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,299
and their neurological symptoms but yet

455
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,700
the answers aren't there

456
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,840
the answers are not there the well is

457
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,000
dry

458
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,200
and it's we're we're not getting an

459
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,140
answer and so people have to understand

460
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,320
something shingles can rash out

461
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,980
and shingles can also not rash out

462
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,700
you can have two just separate accounts

463
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,200
of shingles one can rash out and they

464
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,100
see push tools and then you have the

465
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,980
nerve pain another never shows its face

466
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,740
never Peaks its ugly head

467
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,080
it just stays there on the nerves and

468
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,260
you're walking around looking to try to

469
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,080
get botox injections both Botox

470
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,320
injections in your neck in the side of

471
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,740
your neck right and the nerves near your

472
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,020
brain stem nerves in your spine the

473
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,120
nerves in your neck like you name it and

474
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,160
people have to go and they have to seek

475
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,260
this and look for this Botox in their

476
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,960

into the soul a lot of people have the

540
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,360
shingles virus wreaking havoc creating

541
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,340
inflammation in their trigeminal nerves

542
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,140
and their facial nerves

543
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,419
causing untold amounts of pain and

544
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,000
sorrow for people they have to be on

545
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,340
gabapentin they have to be on benzos

546
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,520

on and what they go through and how

557
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,240
difficult it is and that's not even the

558
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,520
amount of people that are actually going

559
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,200
and looking around for answers and

560
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
they're trying this like they'll go and

561
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,520
try ionized water like alkaline ionized

562
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,799
water that stuff just makes things worse

563
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,559
because of the metal plates leech metal

564
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,620
I tell people stay

565
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,960
a million years

566
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,020
I would never touch in a natural water

567
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,700
machine and a million freaking years I

568
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,620
would never let that stuff poison me and

569
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,200
poison my brain leeching off those metal

570
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,240
plates at a million freaking years never

571
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,380
and so I'm saying that people are then

572
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,640
searching for answers and they're

573
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,320
looking for all these different things

574
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,240
if you're trying that they're trying

575
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,700
this meanwhile they're suffering they're

576
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,299
struggling it's really hard and they

577
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,580
don't have answers so I want to go a

578
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,320
little deeper now

579
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,059
there are people out there suffering

580
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,640
from so many different low-grade viral

581
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,900
viruses and viral infections that

582
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,179
they're dealing with a combination of

583
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,559
different varieties

584
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,539
and

585
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,640
some varieties are the Epstein Barr some

586
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,980
of the shingles some are hhv6 some are

587
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,020
simplex one some are six plus Simplex 2

588
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,240
and they're dealing with multiple

589
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,159
problems in multiple viruses

590
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,500
they'll have an Epstein-Barr and a

591
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,059
shingles they'll have an Epstein-Barr

592
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,240
and they'll have set of megalovirus

593
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:39,900
they'll have that plus they'll have

594
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,940
something like strep and that strip

595
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,620
will work along with the Epstein-Barr

596
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,480
virus so they'll have a combination of a

597
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,919
few different things bacteria plus

598
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,780
viruses

599
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,400
and then these things are what gives

600
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,500
people all these different crazy

601
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
neurological symptoms as they live their

602
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,200
life

603
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,539
so they wake up in the morning and their

604
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,740
problems not gone it's still there and

605
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,320
then the next day they wake up in the

606
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,880
morning they still have ticks and spasms

607
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,380
they still have aches and pains they

608
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,360
still have fatigue

609
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,400
because until you get the answers to why

610
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,840
these nerves are inflamed and learn that

611
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,940
these nerves are inflamed from these

612
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,760
viral infections can you actually

613
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,320
address them and do something about it

614
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,120
and so

615
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,159
it's important to know the medical

616
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,280
medium info was just about like taking

617
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,840
away everybody's food far from it it's

618
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,260
about giving you options you never

619
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,120
thought you could use or do and then

620
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,140
having those options to help heal the

621
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,679
body

622
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,000
everybody has a choice to make they can

623
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,860
eat the things they want they have their

624
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
own free will but if they're really sick

625
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:44,580
it's good to know why it's okay to

626
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
remove something let's take eggs for an

627
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,179
example

628
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,320
viruses love eggs it's their favorite

629
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,200
food

630
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,299
out of everything if someone was to say

631
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,120
aw I'm gonna

632
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:00,179
I'm gonna take all your food away from

633
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,460
you but I'm just gonna leave you a few

634
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,140
options I'm Gonna Leave You this roasted

635
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,120
chicken I'm Gonna Leave You this

636
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,220
chocolate cake I'm Gonna Leave You this

637
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,779
cheese and I'm Gonna Leave You these

638
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,400
eggs

639
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,279
and they said that's all you're gonna

640
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,679
have you're gonna starve to death unless

641
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:21,000
you choose one of these unless you

642
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:23,520
choose eggs or cheese or chicken

643
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,340
or chocolate cake

644
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,919
and weeks go by and I haven't eaten any

645
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,200
of those and I have to make a choice and

646
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,240
I know I have to make a choice I'm going

647
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,500
to tell you right now I'm not going to

648
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,539
choose

649
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,299
the egg

650
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,140
the last thing I would ever choose is

651
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,820
the egg

652
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,380
and you'll see out there people saying

653
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,240
eggs are so good for you eggs are

654
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,279
important eggs are filled with protein

655
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,340
you should have all the eggs you want

656
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,620
you should never not eat eggs the egg

657
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,580
yolks are good though egg whites are

658
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,559
good

659
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,100
you should be on eggs you'll hear that

660
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,140
all day long out there everywhere

661
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,640
but that's the last thing I would choose

662
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,120
because

663
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,299
if there's ever a bacteria or a pathogen

664
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:13,140
or anything in the body the egg will

665
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:16,140
feed it if there's anything in there the

666
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,460
egg will feed it and that's important to

667
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,679
know

668
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,179
cheese and dairy will feed viruses and

669
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,980
pathogens

670
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,799
and that's another thing too that feeds

671
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,380
viruses and pathogens the chickens not

672
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,020
my favorite go-to because it's so high

673
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,820
in fat people don't realize that it's at

674
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,400
the highest in fat but it's actually

675
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,260
something that's not my go-to right and

676
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
chocolate Cake's not my go-to because I

677
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,980
don't want to destroy my adrenal glands

678
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,260
I want to protect my adrenal glands I

679
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,480
want to keep my adrenal glands happy and

680
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,299
I don't want my adrenal glands jacked up

681
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,100
on all that caffeine and then I don't

682
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,840
want to be addicted either so that

683
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,840
wouldn't be my go-to either but

684
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,340
regardless I wouldn't choose the eggs

685
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,779
so I want to go into some more symptoms

686
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,659
conditions how many of you guys are

687
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,640
dealing with ticks spasms

688
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,980
where you have them on your body all the

689
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,840
time you feel them in your arms you feel

690
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,240
them in your chest you feel them in your

691
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,419
your eyes you feel them around your eyes

692
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,559
you feel them on the sides of your face

693
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,140
okay

694
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,480
so many people are dealing with a lot of

695
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,760
the different ticks and spasms

696
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,080
so ticks and spasms can be a combination

697
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,120
where you're dealing with low grade

698
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,919
viral infections but you're also dealing

699
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,179
with toxic heavy metals and that's the

700
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,799
next thing I want to go into a little

701
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,140
bit

702
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
it's one thing to have viruses inside of

703
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,500
us creating neurological symptoms

704
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,779
through inflammation caused by

705
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,900
neurotoxins being released from the

706
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:42,659
viral infections so viruses eating foods

707
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,299
that it likes such as eggs and then

708
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,799
releasing neurotoxins that get onto the

709
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,960
nerves and inflame them it's one thing

710
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,520
to have that it's another to also be

711
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,400
high in toxic heavy metals without

712
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,200
realizing it and a blood test does not

713
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,440
determine how high you are in toxic

714
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,559
heavy metals nor do a hair analysis or a

715
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,440
urine analysis will not determine how

716
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:07,980
high you are in toxic heavy metals that

717
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,480
is an important understanding if you

718
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
want to heal because you can be thrown

719
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,900
off your game

720
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,820
you go and you get a test or a hair

721
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,679
analysis for toxic heavy metals doesn't

722
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,179
look like it's a big problem but you're

723
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,380
struggling with symptoms and conditions

724
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,659
you don't think you need to do anything

725
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,399
about it but here's how it works toxic

726
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,039
heavy metals burrow themselves deep

727
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,500
within organs

728
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,360
deep inside the brain

729
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,279
deep inside the liver

730
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,840
they sit in there and they're not

731
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,419
available

732
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,419
to be drawn out of the blood they're not

733
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,940
easily available to be taken out of the

734
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,340
blood for an analysis

735
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:48,059
for a viewing

736
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,279
they hide and they stay dormant and

737
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,380
that's what metals do they can stay in

738
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,640
your bones and never show up in the

739
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,659
bloodstream when someone's getting

740
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,659
tested on any level

741
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,860
biggest reason behind autoimmune

742
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:04,820
and chronic health conditions like

743
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,820
neurological symptoms

744
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,580
is toxic heavy metals

745
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,500
and viruses and pathogens

746
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,700
toxic heavy metals and viruses and

747
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,039
pathogens

748
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,260
it's the biggest combination

749
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,120
viruses tend to like to feed off of

750
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,220
toxic heavy metals the more toxic heavy

751
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,779
metals somebody has the more neurotoxins

752
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,880
the virus can produce making somebody

753
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,220
feel like that got chronic inflammation

754
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,559

how can you detox from heavy metals good

780
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,820
question heavy metals don't just leave

781
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:38,340
heavy metals don't just get up and leave

782
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,740
hey I'm gonna get up now I'm a toxic

783
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,299
heavy metal and I'm going to get up and

784
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,820
I'm going to walk on out of that

785
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,220
person's body maybe that person can Will

786
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,799

787
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,299
hey that person's willing me out I'm

788
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,740
going to be a toxic heavy metal and

789
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,539
leave the person's body and that person

790
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,539
is going to manifest me right out of the

791
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,460
body just like that and hey if I try all

792
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,799
these different things maybe that'll

793
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,240
help too maybe some zeolite will help

794
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,380
maybe something else will help maybe

795
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,600
something but it's not it's not

796
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,159
Metals don't go and they don't go with a

797
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,620
lot of the trendy crap that's out there

798
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,840
they don't remove metals

799
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,240
it's not how it works

800
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,260
in order to truly get Metals out of the

801
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,760
body you need five ingredients that I've

802
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,260
talked about check out the heavy metal

00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,820
check it out when you get the chance

805
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,460
if you look here at brain saver

806
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,440

so you'll see the ways to get Metals out

812
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,200
and guess what

813
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,220
this heavy metal detox smoothie and

814
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,320
cleanse is the most known and popular in

815
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,779
the world of Health for getting Metals

816
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,000
out because it works so much so that so

817
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,860
many people have ripped off

818
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,419
ripped off

819
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,880
the ideas

820
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,740
right they'll take one ingredient two

821
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,120
ingredients from the heavy metal detox

822
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,640
smoothie and then they'll add something

823
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,159
they want to sell or something to it

824
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,899
but this is by far hands down the way to

825
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,220
get Metals out I've said it so many

826
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:19,380
times over the years and so many people

827
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,779
got their lives back after they got rid

828
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,299
of their metals

829
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,480
Ian Lampson said what about emotionally

830
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,980
charged shakes okay that's really a good

831
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,799
point

832
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,140
okay let's hit it

833
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:35,880
if your nerves are inflamed like your

834
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,539
vagus nerves

835
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,460
endophrenic nerves and they're inflamed

836
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,460
an adrenaline surge occurs

837
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,220
them nerves are gonna light that up

838
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:54,840
did you hear that bleep

839
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,760
them nerves are gonna light the freak up

840
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,440
that's what they're gonna do that's what

841
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,799
they're gonna do that's emotionally

842
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,380
charged shakes emotionally charged

843
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,480
nervous system conditions

844
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,399
when you get jacked up because you're

845
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,780
getting emotionally triggered you're

846
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,980
getting triggered by something happening

847
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,859
something that's out of your control

848
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,080
someone said some stuff about you maybe

849
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:18,960
it's family maybe it's friends maybe

850
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,659
it's co-workers whatever it is maybe

851
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,300
someone's just talking crap and talking

852
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,820
smack and you had enough and you're just

853
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,859
finally pissed and it hits you and

854
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,859
you're just charged up and now you're

855
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:34,379
just shaking you feel it internally you

856
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:35,760
feel it in your hands and your knees you

857
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,940
just feel it and you're getting those

858
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,460
emotionally charged shakes

859
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,379
you have to have sensitive nerves for

860
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,060
the most part for those emotionally

861
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,740
charged shakes

862
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,879
sensitive nerves

863
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,619
but

864
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,599
you could be somebody pretty solid

865
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,940
pretty tough

866
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
and still get them

867
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,119
but if you're somebody who's really

868
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,520
sensitive you've been through a lot

869
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,260
you're been chronically sick you have

870
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,940
neurological symptoms already you're

871
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,180
dealing with a lot and then you get a

872
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,940
jab at you then you get a trigger at you

873
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,740
oh man you can be going through ticks

874
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,320
and spasms you could be spasming

875
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,900
everywhere you can be shaking you can be

876
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,359
sick your stomach can be flipping you

877
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,160
can be a really really feeling it when

878
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:22,800
you get an emotional jab an emotional

879
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,359
hit you can really feel it and it could

880
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,400
be a really hard

881
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:27,900
really hard

882
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,700
and I've seen people go through that

883
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,440
it's really difficult for a lot of

884
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,240
people you can be somebody that's more

885
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
solid meaning you're not that sick

886
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,900
you're not that chronically sick you

887
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,359
haven't had enough problems with that

888
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,280
you haven't had that much go on and then

889
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,720
someone gives you a jab someone triggers

890
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,520
you and you got the you got the

891
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,480
emotional shakes you got the emotional

892
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,820
shakes

893
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,380
it's not tanking you it's not taking you

894
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,300
down to the ground

895
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,280
depends on what the news is depends on

896
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,839
what it is that's triggering you what

897
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,520
I'm trying to say is if you're sensitive

898
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,839
and you're hypersensitive and your vagus

899
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,040
nerves are inflamed and your phrenic

900
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,839
nerves are inflamed and you're going

901
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,000
through a lot you're gonna feel it

902
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,200
you're gonna get jacked up from it your

903
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
nerves are going to move a little bit

904
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,660
more and they're going to shake a little

905
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,099
bit more they're going to Spas them a

906
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,260
little bit more and you're going to

907
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,940
struggle

908
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,740
reason why

909
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,000
because the adrenaline is going to flood

910
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,980
your system and it's going to touch

911
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,240
those inflamed nerves and those inflamed

912
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,320
nerves are going to go on fire and

913
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,900
they're going to light up they're going

914
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,579
to just light right up

915
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,359
because that adrenaline's just going to

916
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,040
go someone pisses you off

917
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,300
adrenaline just do that like out of the

918
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,980
adrenal

919
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,359
adrenaline just

920
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,680
and then you've got this blend of

921
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,300
adrenaline and I talk about the medical

922
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,099
meaning books it comes out and it's like

923
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,320
it could be a fear-based adrenaline it

924
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,420
could be an anger-based adrenaline it

925
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,579
could be a sad based adrenaline and as

926
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,859
it's coming up coming out it's corrosive

927
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,119
and that corrosive adrenaline lands on

928
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,740
the nerves and if your nerves are

929
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,720
sensitive you're going to be feeling it

930
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,400
and damn that trigger is going to feel

931
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,640
like it's taken you down and taken you

932
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,640
out

933
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,859
cold white spring nobody knew anything

934
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,839
about Metals before the first medical

935
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:05,280
medium book I have to agree in fact I

936
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,180
was talking to a practitioner the other

937
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,220
day

938
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,800
a well-known practitioner

939
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,780
who's been around who saw everything

940
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,339
before the first medical medium book

941
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,680
came out and that well-known

942
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:18,660
practitioner told me ain't nobody knew

943
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,640
anything about Metals aw that's what

944
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,740
they said nobody knew anything about

945
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,460
Metals before the first medical medium

946
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:29,280
book came out in 2015 I concur greatly I

947
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,800
agree and I will even say in

948
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,560
in British English

949
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,160
indeed

950
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,160
anyway

951
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,060
okay

952
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:50,460
indeed indeed

953
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,740
yes

954
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,619
us Royals we're talking really good

955
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,480
English

956
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,700
language the proper kind

957
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,180
indeed

958
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,180
okay

959
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,180
I just want to say this

960
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,880
nerves can heal

961
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,099
your central nervous system can heal

962
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,540
your vagus nerves can heal your phrenic

963
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,820
nerves can heal your trigeminal nerves

964
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,560
can heal your nerves

965
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,380
can heal

966
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,660
they just need the things they need and

967
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,460
they need time they need some patience

968
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,260
but I understand because when you've

969
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,940
been sick for a long time

970
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,420
and you've been down and out for a long

971
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,599
time patience this grows weary and grows

972
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,640
weary and patience Thins and it Thins

973
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,320
and it Thins

974
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,800
and I understand

975
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,140
I totally get that I do

976
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,420
so even when you've been given an answer

977
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,400
and you've got a direction if your

978
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,160
patience has been out and you've

979
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,720
struggled long enough it's hard to just

980
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,920
say you know what I'm gonna do this you

981
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,839
know what I'm going to commit and I'm

982
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,720
gonna make this happen but I'm promising

983
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,579
this that your nerves want to heal every

984
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,079
single one of your cranial nerves it

985
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:07,740

987
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,940

998
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,720

1001
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,599
explained

1002
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,760
and they got lesions on their optic

1003
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,619

from viruses

1005
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,300
Emily harridan says could you please

1006
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,579

1007
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,680

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:09,060
plaque tight chest in Tim Okay so

1011
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,460
first of all walking if you can walk is

1012
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,940
critical anybody

1013
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,060
anybody walking is miraculous

1014
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,000
it is powerful don't underestimate it on

1015
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,400
any level if you're somebody that

1016
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,200
wasn't sick at one time in your life and

1017
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,540
you're a runner

1018
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,180
your Avid exerciser

1019
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,339
you do weights whatever you do you might

1020
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,839
think that walking is chump change but

1021
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,220
it's not

1022
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,760
walking

1023
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,980
is one of the most powerful ways to

1024
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,240
exercise while you're healing with

1025
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,940
chronic illness and you're dealing with

1026
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,980
sensitivities and chronic issues and

1027
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,240
neurological problems

1028
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,180
chronic fatigue syndrome and

1029
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,160
fibromyalgia walking's a big one that

1030
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,839
alone is incredible swimming's another

1031
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,240
one too

1032
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,800
I know that a lot of pools are hemmed

1033
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,540
out big time

1034
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,400
they're coming out

1035
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,859
they got a lot of anti you know

1036
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,900
fungicides in there

1037
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,579
for fungus like you know they got a lot

1038
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,040
of different you know chlorine High

1039
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,540
chlorine levels So It's Tricky but any

1040
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,480
kind of swimming in any kind of

1041
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,480
situation that's cleaner than that

1042
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,300
without the high chem is also really

1043
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,880
powerful too walking

1044
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,099
swimming

1045
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,420
these are two options right there that I

1046
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,859
always tell people they should be doing

1047
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,180
depending on each person you might be

1048
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,800
somebody that's able to start doing some

1049
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,359
resistance training

1050
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,380
you might be somebody that's doing just

1051
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:40,020
baby steps with resistance

1052
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,820
rebounding another great one

1053
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,440
it's another thing too cold wide spring

1054
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,400
no one is talking about rebounding back

1055
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,980
in 2015 and before very few it was one

1056
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,359
of those niches that was tucked away and

1057
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,560
it wasn't for chronically ill it wasn't

1058
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,900
for the chronically ill was it for

1059
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,500
anybody it was just one of those things

1060
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,540
the mini trampoline they called it

1061
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,079
and I talked about it in the medical

1062
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,359
medium Book 2015

1063
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,820
I talked about rebounding that's another

1064
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:11,520
one for The Chronic chronically ill it's

1065
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,560
a great one it could be rebounding for

1066
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,300
one minute a day

1067
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,680
with counting it you're watching the

1068
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,359
minute and you're rebounding for one

1069
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,980
minute they gotta understand something

1070
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,300
if you're somebody that you're not sick

1071
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,859
you're not struggling you might think

1072
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,940
this is a joke when I say one minute a

1073
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,560
day of rebounding but when you're

1074
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,900
struggling you just got off a mattress

1075
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,140
Island walking to the bathroom is an

1076
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,140
exercise

1077
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,260
keeping a pedometer on you is actually

1078
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,660
not a bad idea if you're somebody coming

1079
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,579
back from chronic illness just seeing

1080
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,960
how many steps you take in the house as

1081
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,640
you're recovering

1082
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,099
you're like okay you know what I took

1083
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,480
500 steps today sounds like a joke it's

1084
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,920
not a joke for somebody with chronic

1085
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,440
illness you could barely take a shower

1086
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,660
500 steps is a miracle so I'm saying I'm

1087
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,640
taking it Taking us down to that area

1088
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,140
and moving us up maybe there's somebody

1089
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,460
that just deals with a little fatigue

1090
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,780
and you're fighting for it you want to

1091
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,660
do your run and you want to do your

1092
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,880
cardio you want to do your weights

1093
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,099
incredible if you can do that incredible

1094
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,900
rehab Takes Time coming back from a

1095
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,920
chronic illness it takes time and

1096
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,680
patience

1097
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,480
so rehabbing from that takes time any

1098
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,160
steps you take any walking you do

1099
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,780
standing upright so I want to say this

1100
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,700
for people who are really sick and

1101
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,859
chronically chronically ill they've been

1102
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,300
on mattress Island Medical medium term

1103
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,940
mattress style and now I hear people

1104
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,460
saying it out there

1105
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,400
mattress Island

1106
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,619
it's okay if walking around your house

1107
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,680
and in your kitchen and standing upright

1108
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,780
is your exercise because you're laying

1109
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,940
flat so much so many people they're sick

1110
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,040
for a long term they lay flat all the

1111
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,540
time or they lay flat they lay sitting

1112
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,380
up right they lay sitting up in their

1113
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,380
bed like this

1114
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,460
so

1115
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,980
standing that alone is an exercise for

1116
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,680
somebody who's been bedridden somebody

1117
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,560
that's been on mattress Island standing

1118
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,780
walking in their house keeping a

1119
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,040
pedometer counting the steps all that

1120
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:07,440
matters nothing is small time

1121
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,020
50 steps for somebody could be big time

1122
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,000
500 steps could be big time keep that in

1123
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,280
mind now let's go a little bit more say

1124
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,200
somebody they just have some aches and

1125
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,520
pains here and there they're trying to

1126
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,020
control it with whatever they're doing

1127
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,819
out there

1128
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,619
right

1129
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,420
they can run

1130
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,920
they can do some resistance training

1131
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,319
they can do some workouts they can get a

1132
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,060
trainer whatever it is fine that's great

1133
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,000
if you're somebody coming back and

1134
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,680
rehabbing some rebounding swimming if

1135
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,339
it's possible if you have the resources

1136
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,339
the option

1137
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:45,119
riding a bicycle stationary bicycle

1138
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,339
walking on a treadmill walking outside

1139
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,079
all of that can count all of that is

1140
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:51,720
helpful

1141
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,579
and that's the start

1142
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,560
it's hard to go just from being in

1143
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,280
mattress Island straight to an advanced

1144
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,280
yoga class

1145
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:05,960
it's hard to be on mattress Island and

1146
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,960
move to an advanced boom a 10 mile run

1147
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,079
really really hard gotta have patience

1148
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,420
and you get to take one day at a time

1149
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,900
and you gotta baby step it for your

1150
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,900
recovery

1151
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:25,020
Steph says you say don't let your feet

1152
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:28,740
leave the trampoline when rebounding why

1153
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:32,640
you have much more gravity occur when it

1154
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:35,160
doesn't leave you're utilizing

1155
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,200
and manipulating gravity

1156
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,740
when you keep your feet still on the

1157
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,740
rebounder

1158
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,020
you would think it's the opposite you

1159
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,400
jump off the rebounder you're gonna have

1160
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,480
more gravities you're coming down not

1161
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,839
true

1162
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,700
because you're you you have lost control

1163
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:54,119
the minute you jump on the rebounder and

1164
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:57,480
this is this is SOC information

1165
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:00,300
okay giving it to you right here

1166
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,980
the minute you purposely try to leave

1167
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,280
your rebounder you're not in control

1168
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,280
anymore

1169
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,380
you're not in control anymore

1170
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,380
you can do it if you want

1171
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,079
that means you can't manipulate gravity

1172
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,119
with your own body's Force

1173
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,940
you're getting less of a workout when

1174
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,440
you leave the trampoline when you leave

1175
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,240
the rebounder and you leave the mini

1176
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,040
trampoline and you're going up and

1177
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,380
you're doing the jump up you want to go

1178
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,839
up high off there you just lost control

1179
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,880
and you're not now you're you can't

1180
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,680
manipulate gravity anymore with your own

1181
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,040
Force

1182
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,020
with your own body's Force

1183
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,079
you've lost control

1184
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,480
you get less action happening within the

1185
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:50,700
body less results

1186
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:52,980
less blood flow less lymphatic drainage

1187
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,300
less everything

1188
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,700
so if you're somebody and you're leaving

1189
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,160
your rebounder and you're going up up

1190
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,560
down up down like this your lymphatic

1191
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,359
system isn't going to be benefited as

1192
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,920
much hardly

1193
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,660
but when you keep your feet on that

1194
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,520
rebounder and you're going down and

1195
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,619
you're still stay on that rebounder just

1196
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,540
about and you're not really going off of

1197
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,180
it you're now controlling and

1198
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,160
manipulating gravity itself you're using

1199
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,740
your body's Force to do it you're

1200
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,599
focused you're concentrating your brain

1201
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,579
is actually wired to what you're doing

1202
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,079
you want to jump up off that trampoline

1203
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,819
and be off the ground your brain all of

1204
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,119
a sudden stops working

1205
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:32,220
it stops navigating

1206
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,740
you're not able to manipulate gravity

1207
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,540
anymore you're not using more

1208
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,060
introskeletal muscles and you're not

1209
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,079
draining your lymphatic system the way

1210
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,240
you should you're not getting anything

1211
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,740
you're not getting more play so that's

1212
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,599
why it's important to keep your feet on

1213
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:50,280
top of the

1214
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:53,160
mini trampoline on top of the rebounder

1215
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,760

system especially if you're somebody who

1250
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,700
