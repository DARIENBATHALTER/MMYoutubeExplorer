[310.20 - 313.40] are really profound and they're very
[311.88 - 314.96] potent and the thing is when they come
[313.40 - 316.96] down on the top of the crown of the head
[314.96 - 318.84] and they rush through the body and
[316.96 - 322.08] they're hitting all kinds of organs and
[318.84 - 323.76] cells and they're hitting even the soul
[322.08 - 326.36] because our soul is here so they're
[323.76 - 328.84] hitting our soul they're hitting our our
[326.36 - 331.12] our physical brain the light blast is
[328.84 - 332.96] hitting every org every cell it's

[786.88 - 790.72] years old four and a half 5 years old
[788.80 - 793.20] Spirit was telling me about this light
[790.72 - 795.44] and so I found a baby bird and I would
[793.20 - 798.04] have Spirit of compassion send light
[795.44 - 799.96] down onto that baby bird and then I
[798.04 - 801.88] would find an injured Grasshopper And I
[799.96 - 804.04] would have Spirit of comp that a car
[801.88 - 806.56] like bumped into or or ran into or
[804.04 - 809.12] something when it was hopping I remember
[806.56 - 811.24] and I um and I saw it kind of like
[809.12 - 813.16] bopping around on the sidewalk all kind
[811.24 - 814.44] of injured and I would grab this
[813.16 - 816.12] grasshopper and then Spirit of
[814.44 - 818.72] compassion I would say send down the
[816.12 - 820.20] light Spirit of compassion told me about
[818.72 - 821.88] this light that Spirit of compassion can
[820.20 - 824.84] send down so I would hold the
[821.88 - 826.56] grasshopper in my hand and I would have
[824.84 - 829.32] Spirit send down the light into the
[826.56 - 832.04] grasshopper right into my hand and then
[829.32 - 833.72] Spirit of compassion talked about about
[832.04 - 835.96] also if Spirit of compass sends the
[833.72 - 837.84] light into me and then out of my arms
[835.96 - 839.68] out of my hands so that was another
[837.84 - 841.12] thing so there's two kind of light blast
[839.68 - 843.36] that I haven't talked about probably too
[841.12 - 845.16] much is one is the light blast where
[843.36 - 846.40] Spirit sends it directly on the crown of
[845.16 - 848.96] somebody's head and it goes right
[846.40 - 851.32] through their body right that's one
[848.96 - 853.84] variety of light blast the other variety
[851.32 - 857.20] of light blast is going into me and then
[853.84 - 859.64] out my hands which is more intense for
[857.20 - 861.52] me and the other one's intense too but
[859.64 - 863.40] it's it's really intense when it hits me
[861.52 - 866.08] all the time and I used to do that I
[863.40 - 867.76] used to do that one on-one with people
[866.08 - 869.28] back you know in my office throughout
[867.76 - 871.36] the years when I used to help people
[869.28 - 873.56] one-on-one before Spirit of compassion
[871.36 - 875.80] said and everybody begged me to write
[873.56 - 878.08] the Books and get that information
[875.80 - 879.60] worldwide and so what would happen is
[878.08 - 882.56] the light would go through me and out my
[879.60 - 884.56] hands so I would use it that way and and
[882.56 - 887.20] as a child I would do that with a
[884.56 - 889.48] grasshopper in my hand I would do that
[887.20 - 891.04] with an injured frog and I came across
[889.48 - 892.92] an injured frog and I would hold the
[891.04 - 896.64] Frog and have Spirit of compassion send
[892.92 - 899.48] the light down uh on top of the frog is
[896.64 - 903.32] what I would do and you know every every
[899.48 - 906.16] single living you know creature that was
[903.32 - 908.76] injured that I can find I would send
[906.16 - 911.36] light down even if I wasn't able to now
[908.76 - 913.40] hold the creature in my hand remember
[911.36 - 915.80] there was an injured bunny that was
[913.40 - 917.52] running around and I couldn't catch it
[915.80 - 920.56] and I was a child and I couldn't catch
[917.52 - 923.04] the injured bunny um still too fast but
[920.56 - 925.04] yet one leg was injured and I would ask
[923.04 - 927.12] Spirit of compassion to send the light
[925.04 - 930.88] down and I would do the light blast as a
[927.12 - 933.72] child so I would yell light light light
[930.88 - 935.28] light and spirit of compassion would
[933.72 - 937.72] tell me when the light was coming for
[935.28 - 939.40] the injured Bunny with the injured leg
[937.72 - 941.84] so the injured bunny was in a bush and
[939.40 - 944.68] ran away and was in the bush but injured
[941.84 - 946.68] and so I stood there and I said okay
[944.68 - 949.40] let's do this and spirit of compassion
[946.68 - 951.28] said okay on the count of three I'm
[949.40 - 955.88] going to send the light down on that
[951.28 - 958.12] Bunny and you say light you say light
[955.88 - 960.72] and so that light came down on the bunny
[958.12 - 964.08] in the bushes and I said light light
[960.72 - 967.24] light and a day later the bunny's leg
[964.08 - 969.48] was healed it was back out eating grass
[967.24 - 971.96] and it wasn't even limping the bunny's
[969.48 - 974.12] leg was healed and it was the same Bunny
[971.96 - 976.92] and so it was the bunny that we saw
[974.12 - 978.92] every morning and it was healed from
[976.92 - 981.84] that light and that is the power of the
[978.92 - 986.28] light blast that's I've used it my whole
[981.84 - 987.92] life and so it was just really really a
[986.28 - 990.84] beautiful thing to be able to do that
[987.92 - 993.88] with everybody there at this Afterparty
[990.84 - 996.88] such an experience for me to be able to
[993.88 - 998.84] give that to everyone that makes me so

[1028.76 - 1034.44] the push to keep going with your

[1224.04 - 1229.44] world I mean
[1227.16 - 1230.76] seriously I'm going to C up some garlic
[1229.44 - 1232.24] right here we're making a healing broth
[1230.76 - 1233.16] we'll still talk about the light blast a
[1232.24 - 1236.64] little
[1233.16 - 1238.60] bit so all through the years profound
[1236.64 - 1240.44] experiences with the light blast
[1238.60 - 1246.64] profound experiences all through the
[1240.44 - 1248.44] years and um not just not just um I
[1246.64 - 1250.52] mean
[1248.44 - 1255.04] where
[1250.52 - 1257.88] overnight people's bodies just changed
[1255.04 - 1259.80] overnight and I have a deep respect for
[1257.88 - 1265.92] Spirit of compassion and as much as I
[1259.80 - 1269.40] say you you know I joke around a lot and
[1265.92 - 1273.16] I I joke around a lot about being a free
[1269.40 - 1274.60] spirit and um and kind of a rebel like
[1273.16 - 1276.84] rebelling against Spirit when I was
[1274.60 - 1281.20] younger okay and I talk about that a lot
[1276.84 - 1283.00] I have um like for instance playing loud
[1281.20 - 1284.64] things and loud music and stuff like
[1283.00 - 1287.08] that so I don't have to hear spirit in
[1284.64 - 1288.36] my right ear which takes me to another
[1287.08 - 1290.92] thing I want to I want to talk about
[1288.36 - 1293.60] this you'll notice and I I can't believe
[1290.92 - 1295.88] it showed like it did cuz I wasn't
[1293.60 - 1298.72] thinking it would and then I I I heard
[1295.88 - 1301.68] somebody talking about it where when I
[1298.72 - 1304.16] was doing the meet and greet and uh
[1301.68 - 1306.72] people were wanted to tell me something
[1304.16 - 1311.76] and they want to ask me something right
[1306.72 - 1314.48] and I was there standing there I would
[1311.76 - 1316.80] use my left ear to hear them so I would
[1314.48 - 1319.04] use my left ear to hear the person so it
[1316.80 - 1322.32] was like you know
[1319.04 - 1324.32] like so great to meet you and and well
[1322.32 - 1326.64] aw want to tell you something and I
[1324.32 - 1329.12] would actually lean in with my left ear
[1326.64 - 1330.92] because with that many people around and
[1329.12 - 1333.04] everything that was going on Spirit of
[1330.92 - 1335.48] compassion talks to me in my right ear
[1333.04 - 1337.84] so even though I hear Spirit of
[1335.48 - 1339.96] compassion in my left ear it's not like
[1337.84 - 1342.00] the right ear the right ear is the
[1339.96 - 1343.16] strongest point it's where I hear spirit
[1342.00 - 1345.44] and it comes
[1343.16 - 1347.52] through the words come through right
[1345.44 - 1348.88] Spirit comes through and so when I when
[1347.52 - 1350.64] I would talk to somebody somebody I
[1348.88 - 1352.24] would have to lean I would try with my
[1350.64 - 1353.56] right ear sometimes be like it's not
[1352.24 - 1355.68] going to work there's too many people
[1353.56 - 1357.76] here Spirit of compassion is talking to
[1355.68 - 1359.20] me about what's happening in people
[1357.76 - 1361.48] what's happening people around me people
[1359.20 - 1363.80] in back of me information coming through
[1361.48 - 1365.56] in that moment not sure who's who where
[1363.80 - 1367.84] it's coming from each person conspir
[1365.56 - 1369.44] compassions just talking so much so and
[1367.84 - 1371.44] you guys know if you've listened if
[1369.44 - 1373.96] you've um if you listen to the audio
[1371.44 - 1376.36] books medical medium audio a audio books
[1373.96 - 1378.80] or you read them so I would sit there
[1376.36 - 1381.48] and have to listen with my left ear and
[1378.80 - 1383.76] you see it because I watched a little
[1381.48 - 1385.88] bit of the replay you know watched a
[1383.76 - 1388.12] little bit of the live stream too and I
[1385.88 - 1391.84] watched it I was like
[1388.12 - 1394.80] oh there it is you know I'm leaning in
[1391.84 - 1398.52] with my left ear I switched doing that
[1394.80 - 1401.28] so I can hear the person focus on what
[1398.52 - 1403.20] the person you guys were telling me so
[1401.28 - 1404.64] that it wasn't getting in the way with
[1403.20 - 1406.40] Spirit of compassion's information
[1404.64 - 1409.16] coming to my right
[1406.40 - 1411.24] ear so that was happening too
[1409.16 - 1413.76] David witchin said I on YouTube I

[1536.00 - 1540.96] each day goes by it's still there and
[1539.20 - 1542.40] it's still doing little things and it's
[1540.96 - 1544.56] helping the immune system and it's
[1542.40 - 1546.36] helping it's helping like purify the
[1544.56 - 1548.16] liver and it's helping the brain it's
[1546.36 - 1550.92] helping to to loosen things that
[1548.16 - 1555.88] shouldn't be in there it's helping to
[1550.92 - 1559.16] you know like rewire it's helping to you
[1555.88 - 1562.44] know get shed negative energy negative
[1559.16 - 1565.28] energy negative you know like entities
[1562.44 - 1567.96] that torment people out
[1565.28 - 1570.48] there yeah I
[1567.96 - 1573.32] mean people really struggle out there
[1570.48 - 1576.72] with so much psychic attack the one
[1573.32 - 1577.56] thing I love about the light blast is it
[1576.72 - 1581.04] it
[1577.56 - 1583.88] obliterates it destroys psychic attack
[1581.04 - 1587.08] connections right so if you have this
[1583.88 - 1589.60] this this string of energy coming from
[1587.08 - 1593.36] somebody who psychically attacking you
[1589.60 - 1596.36] if you have this um
[1593.36 - 1596.36] this
[1597.04 - 1603.20] basically this wire of negativity going
[1600.52 - 1605.44] to you coming from somebody so see
[1603.20 - 1606.72] somebody and even if it went to you when
[1605.44 - 1608.44] it's not supposed to like there's
[1606.72 - 1610.08] somebody out there hating out there
[1608.44 - 1614.72] there's somebody out there that's
[1610.08 - 1617.20] throwing out just just static and static
[1614.72 - 1619.80] out there and you happen to be walking
[1617.20 - 1621.92] by or you're in in the the wrong place
[1619.80 - 1623.92] whatever at the wrong time and that
[1621.92 - 1626.96] static connects to you now you're
[1623.92 - 1628.52] getting psychically attacked right or
[1626.96 - 1631.84] you're getting psychically attacked by
[1628.52 - 1634.20] somebody somebody somebody out there the
[1631.84 - 1636.56] light blast
[1634.20 - 1639.16] annihilates that psychic attack
[1636.56 - 1641.48] connection so everybody in there and I
[1639.16 - 1644.60] should have talked about it more but you
[1641.48 - 1647.24] know I was just hanging in there trying
[1644.60 - 1649.16] to get those light blasts out there but
[1647.24 - 1650.00] so if anybody came came into there to
[1649.16 - 1652.44] that
[1650.00 - 1654.72] Afterparty and they had a psychic attack
[1652.44 - 1657.08] going on that day or there was a
[1654.72 - 1660.48] continual on andof Psychic attack from
[1657.08 - 1662.68] somebody or something from from far
[1660.48 - 1664.64] away anything like that somebody in
[1662.68 - 1665.92] their life maybe an old relationship
[1664.64 - 1668.20] whatever it is and there's a psychic
[1665.92 - 1671.16] attack going on spread of compassion
[1668.20 - 1674.52] sends it light down it obliterates that
[1671.16 - 1677.32] psychic attack connection boom just cuts
[1674.52 - 1679.24] what people would say the cords right
[1677.32 - 1682.72] slices that
[1679.24 - 1684.92] string or that Essence that's connecting
[1682.72 - 1686.76] it that's keeping that static connected
[1684.92 - 1689.56] on somebody that's keeping them like
[1686.76 - 1691.64] that so they can be mental so they can
[1689.56 - 1693.64] be super emotional so they can be
[1691.64 - 1697.28] doubting themselves so they can be in a
[1693.64 - 1699.56] in a like a funk so they can be in a
[1697.28 - 1703.92] spell spirit of compassion sends a light
[1699.56 - 1706.32] light down to break that boom to shatter
[1703.92 - 1708.32] that away whatever that is and to clean
[1706.32 - 1710.12] that up to make sure you're clear and
[1708.32 - 1712.40] you're free from Psychic attack and
[1710.12 - 1715.76] that's what s so does frees people from
[1712.40 - 1719.04] Psychic attack that alone is
[1715.76 - 1721.60] just so important so let's get some more

[1866.44 - 1871.52] this meet and greet it's not about just
[1869.92 - 1873.84] it's not just about like oh everybody

[1887.60 - 1892.12] before four but really nice bathrooms
[1889.68 - 1894.80] like that's important the other thing is
[1892.12 - 1897.08] the ice packs you know just having that
[1894.80 - 1899.12] ice pack in your hand changes your core
[1897.08 - 1901.08] temperature in your body just in your
[1899.12 - 1902.76] hand you guys and when you're up against
[1901.08 - 1905.56] a heat wve all you have to do is just
[1902.76 - 1908.20] hold that that cold ice pack for just
[1905.56 - 1910.36] even five minutes and you what happens
[1908.20 - 1912.00] is you got your main arteries that go
[1910.36 - 1914.04] right boom down to your hand they go
[1912.00 - 1915.92] down your arm right to your hand and so
[1914.04 - 1918.96] that main artery that runs right down
[1915.92 - 1921.00] here okay you got your ice pack just on
[1918.96 - 1922.68] there like right in your hand like that
[1921.00 - 1924.72] it it's all that blood that's coming
[1922.68 - 1926.56] down your main artery is picking up that
[1924.72 - 1928.40] coolness bringing it back up through the
[1926.56 - 1930.84] veins right all the way back to your
[1928.40 - 1932.24] heart to your brain people are putting
[1930.84 - 1934.04] their cold packs on the back of their
[1932.24 - 1936.12] neck they're putting them on their face
[1934.04 - 1938.16] they're putting them right on their
[1936.12 - 1939.68] chest people were putting the cold packs
[1938.16 - 1941.72] underneath their hats they were just
[1939.68 - 1944.16] doing that and it dropped everybody's
[1941.72 - 1947.36] core temperature while waiting out there
[1944.16 - 1949.56] for a little bit it it's it's just very
[1947.36 - 1951.04] very good good to do it's it was just a
[1949.56 - 1953.80] beautiful thing to see everybody getting
[1951.04 - 1956.64] those ice packs it was part of like we
[1953.80 - 1958.28] got to make sure we you know make people
[1956.64 - 1960.48] comfortable I'm going to pop some more
[1958.28 - 1965.16] garlic in
[1960.48 - 1967.72] here so Max Max uh Max Bond over there
[1965.16 - 1970.32] on YouTube yeah it was just so amazing
[1967.72 - 1972.68] even watching online thank you for
[1970.32 - 1974.68] watching online seriously I also love
[1972.68 - 1977.28] seeing how many medical medium people

[1977.28 - 1982.56] alone but see the industries would love
[1980.56 - 1985.16] to make you feel like you're alone and
[1982.56 - 1987.08] the haters would love to make you feel
[1985.16 - 1989.64] like you're alone okay and that was kind
[1987.08 - 1992.24] of one of the tricks that happened with
[1989.64 - 1994.00] a lot of the hater you know um campaigns
[1992.24 - 1996.44] that were occurring over the last couple
[1994.00 - 1998.48] years is to make people feel like
[1996.44 - 2000.60] they're isolated or alone or something
[1998.48 - 2004.04] like that so to put out things like you
[2000.60 - 2005.76] know like oh you're an M or something or
[2004.04 - 2007.48] you know the game right and it makes
[2005.76 - 2010.08] people feel like oh what am I doing
[2007.48 - 2012.00] something bad am I doing something wrong
[2010.08 - 2014.16] like what am I doing and that's what
[2012.00 - 2016.32] haters do they make you feel like you
[2014.16 - 2018.48] know that yeah that you're isolated that
[2016.32 - 2020.60] you're the only one following medical
[2018.48 - 2024.16] medium that you're the only one that
[2020.60 - 2026.32] does medical medium information you know
[2024.16 - 2028.60] there are millions of people that do
[2026.32 - 2031.04] medical medium information around the
[2028.60 - 2032.68] world in every single country around the
[2031.04 - 2035.40] world doing medical medum
[2032.68 - 2038.28] information and you're not

[2038.28 - 2046.16] people that want the heavy metal detox
[2042.84 - 2048.44] smoothie in airwan they want it
[2046.16 - 2050.16] everywhere and they're in all 10 stores
[2048.44 - 2052.72] right now because you're not the only

[2064.00 - 2068.76] you're not alone and but that's how it
[2066.48 - 2072.72] works it's like
[2068.76 - 2075.44] I think the haters Industries the system
[2072.72 - 2077.64] just want you to feel isolated or
[2075.44 - 2081.72] something alone but you're not it's a
[2077.64 - 2084.28] massive Community massive community in
[2081.72 - 2085.92] you know all of the United States and
[2084.28 - 2089.32] all around the world and all in the
[2085.92 - 2091.44] different countries so yeah Tik Tok just
[2089.32 - 2093.32] restricted uh my feed for the next 10
[2091.44 - 2095.12] minutes I must be talking about
[2093.32 - 2098.36] something all right let's get an onion
[2095.12 - 2098.36] in here
[2099.16 - 2103.40] the wind must have blew somewhere in a
[2101.52 - 2105.84] different
[2103.40 - 2110.36] direction all right so I'm going to pop
[2105.84 - 2110.36] an onion into this heing
[2112.68 - 2116.92] broth so what happened with the light
[2115.00 - 2120.32] blast so when I was a child my parents
[2116.92 - 2123.16] would um have me in the back seat of the
[2120.32 - 2126.20] car we'd be going somewhere we'd be at a
[2123.16 - 2129.36] red light Spirit of compassion would
[2126.20 - 2131.56] give me a lesson
[2129.36 - 2135.04] a lesson as to what was going on in
[2131.56 - 2136.80] somebody's body emotionally physically
[2135.04 - 2140.44] in the next car so it would be at the
[2136.80 - 2142.72] red light I'd be in the back seat Spirit
[2140.44 - 2146.04] of compassion would say what was going
[2142.72 - 2147.92] on with somebody in the car what kind of
[2146.04 - 2150.36] health problem were they faced with what
[2147.92 - 2152.76] kind of struggle were they faced with so
[2150.36 - 2155.44] as I was in the car 10 years old 8 years
[2152.76 - 2157.80] old I mean happened all the time over
[2155.44 - 2159.64] and over again
[2157.80 - 2163.04] uh I would ask Spirit of compassion can
[2159.64 - 2166.76] we send a light blast on top of that car
[2163.04 - 2170.84] so then it was the light blast kind of
[2166.76 - 2172.96] like hitting cars with light so I would
[2170.84 - 2176.72] be 10 years old backseat of my parents'
[2172.96 - 2180.00] car and I would be like you know Spirit
[2176.72 - 2182.72] send light down on that car that you
[2180.00 - 2185.60] said someone was struggling so we'd be
[2182.72 - 2187.28] at the red light and SS would send it
[2185.60 - 2188.72] down right on top of the car roof of the
[2187.28 - 2191.12] car right through the car into the
[2188.72 - 2194.80] crowns of their heads and running right
[2191.12 - 2196.28] through them and after a spirit of
[2194.80 - 2198.72] compassion told me that this person's
[2196.28 - 2200.36] struggling with a kidney problem this
[2198.72 - 2202.56] person's struggling with a heart problem
[2200.36 - 2205.00] this person's struggling with diabetes
[2202.56 - 2208.08] this person's struggling with you know
[2205.00 - 2211.84] some other issue like a liver problem
[2208.08 - 2213.64] pancreas problem emotional
[2211.84 - 2217.08] struggle
[2213.64 - 2220.56] so the light blast became a huge part of
[2217.08 - 2224.28] my ever existence and
[2220.56 - 2227.24] life I used it wherever I
[2224.28 - 2229.96] could I asked Spirit of compassion to
[2227.24 - 2229.96] send down the
[2230.52 - 2237.48] light thousands of
[2234.08 - 2239.84] times thousands of times and I wonder
[2237.48 - 2241.00] who did it affect who did it help I
[2239.84 - 2243.28] didn't know the people that were in the
[2241.00 - 2245.76] car next to me where are they now what
[2243.28 - 2249.52] happened did it help them through their
[2245.76 - 2249.52] life at that point
[2252.52 - 2257.64] H brand says over there on YouTube the
[2255.24 - 2260.12] card you gave me said you deserve to be
[2257.64 - 2262.32] happy after the light blast I felt the
[2260.12 - 2264.60] happiest I have ever felt now I'm
[2262.32 - 2268.48] actually going to okay I'm chopping an
[2264.60 - 2271.08] onion now thank God a very a very rare
[2268.48 - 2271.08] occurrence you
[2272.16 - 2277.44] said okay for some reason that got me

[2292.04 - 2301.56] Neo are favorites for me don't be
[2297.48 - 2303.84] sad my monitor wasn't working I couldn't
[2301.56 - 2306.88] hear my guitar one note and I couldn't
[2303.84 - 2309.08] hear my voice one note because the sound
[2306.88 - 2311.80] text kind of like I think messed
[2309.08 - 2314.32] something up and the mic on my guitar
[2311.80 - 2316.32] wasn't on so they're because when you're
[2314.32 - 2319.20] out there on a stage that big and you
[2316.32 - 2321.60] play you can't hear it you can't hear
[2319.20 - 2324.24] one note that you're touching when
[2321.60 - 2326.80] you're out there everything absorbs it
[2324.24 - 2330.04] right and so there was a mic on my
[2326.80 - 2333.16] guitar that was off so it wasn't
[2330.04 - 2335.12] allowing anyone or or was allowing me
[2333.16 - 2337.08] especially to hear what notes I was
[2335.12 - 2339.40] playing and if I'm going to sing I do
[2337.08 - 2341.44] need to hear the notes cuz I'm not a pro
[2339.40 - 2344.00] singer you know but I do need to hear
[2341.44 - 2347.84] the notes but didn't and then the other
[2344.00 - 2349.52] thing happened was um my monitor was off
[2347.84 - 2351.56] so I didn't hear anything I was singing
[2349.52 - 2354.76] so it was like just singing to nothing
[2351.56 - 2356.92] to air air you couldn't hear it you just
[2354.76 - 2360.36] know you were saying the words so I was
[2356.92 - 2362.08] trying to sing words didn't hear it at
[2360.36 - 2364.64] all through the monitor cuz it wasn't
[2362.08 - 2367.44] hooked up and I couldn't hear the guitar
[2364.64 - 2369.84] basically I was just standing there like
[2367.44 - 2373.12] a naked
[2369.84 - 2376.96] baby throwing it all out there later on
[2373.12 - 2377.88] when I watched I was like oh my God God

[2672.96 - 2678.76] stream it was outstanding I felt so
[2674.96 - 2681.84] included and like a big part of me was
[2678.76 - 2684.84] there now after the light blast it is
[2681.84 - 2687.24] like my soul got into my body again and
[2684.84 - 2689.04] a weight is lifted off of me so I want
[2687.24 - 2691.28] to say that I want to talk about that
[2689.04 - 2694.56] for a
[2691.28 - 2697.44] second okay I want to talk about that
[2694.56 - 2701.08] for a second the thing is with the light
[2697.44 - 2702.80] blast is a lot of people are out of body
[2701.08 - 2706.00] they're having such hard times in their
[2702.80 - 2707.92] life their soul is is is in them a
[2706.00 - 2710.00] little bit then out of them then in them
[2707.92 - 2711.92] a little bit then out of them it's like
[2710.00 - 2714.00] a a protection method to protect our
[2711.92 - 2716.48] soul so it doesn't get truly damaged and
[2714.00 - 2720.00] injured down here on this planet Earth
[2716.48 - 2721.72] of of so much like evil and you know
[2720.00 - 2725.28] trust breaking
[2721.72 - 2727.28] and I mean think about it I mean we know
[2725.28 - 2730.96] planet earth has a lot of evil crap
[2727.28 - 2734.24] going on going down I mean we know that
[2730.96 - 2736.56] you know that if anybody is in complete
[2734.24 - 2739.44] denial of that like they don't think
[2736.56 - 2741.00] evil crap is going on around this planet
[2739.44 - 2742.32] and stuff like that they're in there
[2741.00 - 2745.16] they're in their own little bubble God
[2742.32 - 2746.96] bless them that means it obviously maybe
[2745.16 - 2748.44] it's not affecting them or hasn't
[2746.96 - 2751.24] affected them yet or they just don't
[2748.44 - 2755.12] know what is affecting them or not
[2751.24 - 2759.20] but man what happens is we get we get
[2755.12 - 2761.80] out of body a lot because of so much uh
[2759.20 - 2764.36] adversity and so much struggle
[2761.80 - 2766.64] and simple little things that could be
[2764.36 - 2769.40] simpler little to somebody somebody else
[2766.64 - 2771.28] could be a serious thing for you people
[2769.40 - 2773.28] can get triggered so easily and they can
[2771.28 - 2776.96] their soul can just be popping out of
[2773.28 - 2780.64] them left and right because of PTSD P
[2776.96 - 2782.36] PTSD for sure um could be happening for
[2780.64 - 2786.20] so many so I got some carrots in there

[3153.40 - 3157.52] day of my life I was so happy and felt
[3155.44 - 3159.92] surrounded by so much light I truly felt
[3157.52 - 3163.12] like a part of your family and could
[3159.92 - 3166.32] feel the love and compassion you had for
[3163.12 - 3169.48] us I need a good

[3180.56 - 3186.28] back to the world after so much light
[3183.80 - 3188.88] and a piece of heaven at the event it
[3186.28 - 3191.36] was like how it's supposed to be there

[3191.36 - 3199.92] way and I have to tell you that um you
[3196.68 - 3202.68] know after after leaving the event and
[3199.92 - 3205.16] kind of going back into the world a
[3202.68 - 3207.88] little bit the normal everyday stuff it
[3205.16 - 3209.28] was like my car turned into a pumpkin
[3207.88 - 3211.64] you know is that what it is the carriage
[3209.28 - 3213.44] turns back into the pumpkin correct me

[3250.84 - 3254.48] something Marissa spiritual says I
[3252.96 - 3256.48] started tearing up watching the live
[3254.48 - 3259.28] stream when I saw the umbrellas being
[3256.48 - 3261.40] put up so thoughtful and considerate you
[3259.28 - 3263.36] know what's what's funny is when we were
[3261.40 - 3266.72] asking for those umbrellas when we were
[3263.36 - 3268.84] like find somebody now to get these
[3266.72 - 3270.44] umbrellas here like find somebody
[3268.84 - 3272.68] someone we have to get this stuff you
[3270.44 - 3275.36] know what we heard well at events every
[3272.68 - 3277.24] place was like well at events um they
[3275.36 - 3278.96] don't offer umbrellas for people at
[3277.24 - 3280.40] events doesn't matter how hot or rainy
[3278.96 - 3282.20] it is or whatever it is they just let
[3280.40 - 3283.72] people stand out there including like
[3282.20 - 3285.68] you know like rock concerts and
[3283.72 - 3287.36] musicians and all that stuff that do
[3285.68 - 3289.16] like you know any kind of event stuff in
[3287.36 - 3291.28] the world and people come and crowds
[3289.16 - 3293.44] come it's like there's no no such thing
[3291.28 - 3295.16] and I said doesn't matter I don't care
[3293.44 - 3297.00] what other people do I don't care what
[3295.16 - 3300.04] other people do
[3297.00 - 3301.92] we need to get umbrellas here I don't
[3300.04 - 3303.88] care and that's what happened my team

[3303.88 - 3309.44] fighting for it they're like umbrellas
[3306.44 - 3311.28] now get umbrellas and it didn't matter
[3309.44 - 3312.88] what every time we stumbled across a
[3311.28 - 3314.32] place that might have had umbrellas
[3312.88 - 3315.96] they're like that's nonsense you don't
[3314.32 - 3318.60] put umbrellas out for people that are
[3315.96 - 3320.92] waiting for this or waiting for that
[3318.60 - 3324.16] we're like we don't
[3320.92 - 3326.08] care like what we went through Fox L

[3610.16 - 3615.48] just intense all right look I'm going to
[3612.72 - 3616.60] pop a lid on this broth that was the
[3615.48 - 3619.20] longest
[3616.60 - 3622.44] broth if you're taking that long to make
[3619.20 - 3626.04] your healing broth ice packs were not
[3622.44 - 3629.32] coming in on time right we ordered
[3626.04 - 3632.56] thousands of ice packs get this we
[3629.32 - 3637.28] ordered thousands of ice packs like it
[3632.56 - 3640.08] was like like $7,000 in ice packs and
[3637.28 - 3642.92] they never got delivered we lost the
[3640.08 - 3645.72] $7,000 the ice packs just went who knows
[3642.92 - 3648.48] where they were like hijacked somewhere
[3645.72 - 3651.24] and we were like no we have to get them
[3648.48 - 3653.56] so then we the Heatwave was
[3651.24 - 3655.68] record-breaking someone we we think
[3653.56 - 3658.80] somebody hijacked our ice packs as they
[3655.68 - 3660.80] were being like sent to us we lost the
[3658.80 - 3663.64] hunk of money whatever we just have to
[3660.80 - 3667.36] get ice packs we then we went another
[3663.64 - 3670.52] route and was like emergency find ice
[3667.36 - 3672.24] packs and a whole another round of ice
[3670.52 - 3675.04] packs and
[3672.24 - 3680.00] then because of record
[3675.04 - 3683.72] Heatwave right it's like the Afterparty
[3680.00 - 3687.92] facility had air conditioning but to
[3683.72 - 3690.84] have you know a ton of people in there
[3687.92 - 3692.64] in a record-breaking heat wve that every
[3690.84 - 3694.84] building in La was struggling with
[3692.64 - 3698.20] cooling down like every building in La
[3694.84 - 3701.84] was struggling to keep cool we're like
[3698.20 - 3705.08] it's not good enough so what we did was
[3701.84 - 3707.20] we like we worked hard and my team they
[3705.08 - 3710.28] were killing themselves getting an air
[3707.20 - 3712.72] conditioning trucking company to come in
[3710.28 - 3716.40] the middle of the night and set up these
[3712.72 - 3720.52] large pumping tubes into the place and
[3716.40 - 3722.64] pump AC into that building at the
[3720.52 - 3724.92] Afterparty and I remember like it was a

[3985.28 - 3989.52] they remind me of you guys and and
[3987.60 - 3992.28] that's really what it's about too
[3989.52 - 3992.28] somewhere over
[3992.40 - 3998.28] there the whole event blew my mind the
[3995.92 - 4000.92] light blasts were powerful the food was
[3998.28 - 4003.96] the best I've ever had and I felt so
[4000.92 - 4006.24] good after I ate it being at an event
[4003.96 - 4008.84] that I didn't have to worry about food
[4006.24 - 4010.88] touched my heart more than you know okay
[4008.84 - 4012.44] that really touches my heart right now
[4010.88 - 4014.68] because when I think about that here you
[4012.44 - 4016.16] are you're at an event and you're not
[4014.68 - 4018.16] worried about what you're eating you're
[4016.16 - 4020.44] not worried about like what is going to
[4018.16 - 4022.36] be in this food what is there canola oil
[4020.44 - 4024.56] in this food and that's the thing there
[4022.36 - 4026.52] was no canola oil in that food and
[4024.56 - 4028.72] that's the thing there was no natural
[4026.52 - 4030.64] flavors in that food there was no

[4407.36 - 4411.76] you start moving past your symptoms a
[4409.88 - 4414.40] little bit at a time and moving forward

[4442.00 - 4448.36] God okay I'm going to start crying all

[4507.52 - 4512.16] you you are the best
[4513.68 - 4519.28] Amy you know I I think that if
[4519.36 - 4525.00] if you
[4521.48 - 4532.32] know one thing Spirit of compassion did
[4525.00 - 4535.08] for me was to um to to teach me to do
[4532.32 - 4537.36] everything I could to understand right
[4535.08 - 4539.84] um I always ask Spirit of compassion
[4537.36 - 4541.64] like why me why me you know I did that
[4539.84 - 4545.16] when I was younger I don't do it anymore
[4541.64 - 4547.56] really it's it's rare now um but I will
[4545.16 - 4549.76] sometimes squeak that out but it's
[4547.56 - 4551.48] nothing like it was when I was younger
[4549.76 - 4553.32] you know when I was in my teens and I
[4551.48 - 4555.44] tell tell Spirit of compassion like why
[4553.32 - 4557.68] me why are you talking to me why why am
[4555.44 - 4560.28] I supposed to be helping people why am I
[4557.68 - 4562.00] supposed to someday put all this
[4560.28 - 4565.12] information out there and be that
[4562.00 - 4567.20] messenger and you know can't you find
[4565.12 - 4568.80] somebody else can't you find somebody
[4567.20 - 4570.36] else that's what I would say I I
[4568.80 - 4571.88] remember that was my Mantra you know how
[4570.36 - 4574.04] people have mantras and they have they
[4571.88 - 4576.16] do affirmations it's like and they're
[4574.04 - 4578.04] doing these affirmations my Mantra was
[4576.16 - 4580.28] can't you find somebody else you know
[4578.04 - 4584.76] when I was a kid and I was like 12 years
[4580.28 - 4586.32] old 13 years old and um and I think that
[4584.76 - 4588.32] what what happens is that like Spirit of
[4586.32 - 4590.72] compassion you know gave me some
[4588.32 - 4592.48] valuable lessons and teachings you know
[4590.72 - 4596.24] when I was younger about how it was so
[4592.48 - 4598.92] critical so the way you care about that
[4596.24 - 4601.28] frog with the in with the injury or the
[4598.92 - 4603.24] way you care about that Bunny with the
[4601.28 - 4605.60] with the broken leg or the way you care
[4603.24 - 4608.68] about that grasshopper or that baby bird
[4605.60 - 4611.20] you have to that same compassion and
[4608.68 - 4613.16] caring you have to you know find it in
[4611.20 - 4615.68] your heart and care about people and
[4613.16 - 4617.60] care about you know indivual uals and I
[4615.68 - 4620.16] remember being taught these lessons in
[4617.60 - 4621.56] very powerful times in my life too when
[4620.16 - 4624.28] I was questioning something or
[4621.56 - 4625.96] questioning this as a younger person in
[4624.28 - 4628.04] questioning that and spirit of
[4625.96 - 4630.00] compassion would show me and give me
[4628.04 - 4632.56] these these profound pieces of
[4630.00 - 4635.32] information these messages that I would
[4632.56 - 4637.00] use to help me understand you know why
[4635.32 - 4639.08] it's critical to have compassion for
[4637.00 - 4640.92] people it's critical to have compassion
[4639.08 - 4642.68] and to know what 33 years of being sick
[4640.92 - 4643.84] or 10 years of being sick and five years
[4642.68 - 4646.56] of being sick
[4643.84 - 4650.16] is it doesn't matter if I haven't been
[4646.56 - 4653.08] sick for 10 years um I have to know what
[4650.16 - 4654.84] that either feels like to some degree or
[4653.08 - 4657.24] understand it to some degree and feel
[4654.84 - 4660.08] that person's feeling and know that it
[4657.24 - 4661.84] matters um it matters and it makes a
[4660.08 - 4663.52] difference if we can move that person
[4661.84 - 4665.64] forward and get them through that out of

[4741.60 - 4746.48] my best I try my best to get the
[4744.68 - 4748.60] information out there and fight for it I
[4746.48 - 4750.96] have for years it's gotten a lot harder
[4748.60 - 4752.28] though hasn't it you guys so I mean the
[4750.96 - 4755.44] way things are going and the health
[4752.28 - 4758.28] scene became like political and became
[4755.44 - 4759.80] like um Feeding Frenzy and everybody's
[4758.28 - 4761.96] trying to do shock and awe every 10
[4759.80 - 4764.72] seconds flat and everybody's just
[4761.96 - 4766.40] stealing this and doing that is crazy so
[4764.72 - 4769.48] Sophie over there norstrom over there on
[4766.40 - 4773.60] YouTube aw we danced like
[4769.48 - 4776.84] crazy it was so much fun the DJs were
[4773.60 - 4778.20] excellent I was so sweaty and everyone
[4776.84 - 4780.88] was
[4778.20 - 4782.80] shaking everyone was everyone was
[4780.88 - 4785.80] shaking
[4782.80 - 4788.84] it okay now that's funny all
[4785.80 - 4789.99] right and it suddenly dawned on me that
[4788.84 - 4793.32] everyone there was
[4789.99 - 4796.64] [Laughter]
[4793.32 - 4798.20] sober all right
[4796.64 - 4799.28] all right that was funny Sophie that's
[4798.20 - 4801.80] actually
[4799.28 - 4804.00] hilarious so everybody was moving and
[4801.80 - 4805.92] grooving is what everybody was moving
[4804.00 - 4807.84] and grooving it and suddenly it dawned
[4805.92 - 4810.56] on you that everybody was sober okay
[4807.84 - 4813.80] that's that's hilarious that's
[4810.56 - 4817.04] hilarious summer
[4813.80 - 4818.96] 5411 people that aren't sick don't
[4817.04 - 4821.92] understand the stress sick people have
[4818.96 - 4825.76] around finding food that's okay having
[4821.92 - 4827.72] food that we knew wouldn't make us sick
[4825.76 - 4829.84] was the most touching part for me you
[4827.72 - 4833.56] really thought of everything and at no
[4829.84 - 4835.84] cost to attendees was
[4833.56 - 4838.20] mindblowing I I think it's interesting
[4835.84 - 4841.56] you know it was a new a new experience
[4838.20 - 4843.64] for me when you feed when you feed a a
[4841.56 - 4846.84] large crowd of people like that and then
[4843.64 - 4848.60] you feed them and no no cost mattered it
[4846.84 - 4850.04] didn't matter it just had to be the best
[4848.60 - 4853.84] it had to be the best of everything and
[4850.04 - 4855.76] we had to make it happen and um it was a
[4853.84 - 4859.16] it was an experience
[4855.76 - 4861.12] because who does that right but but
[4859.16 - 4863.00] being that I had to be I mean I have to
[4861.12 - 4865.04] experience it myself because word doing
[4863.00 - 4866.72] it it's an experience on its own it was
[4865.04 - 4868.92] really interesting there's so much I was
[4866.72 - 4870.48] learning from that experience of making
[4868.92 - 4872.84] sure we had what we had for everybody
[4870.48 - 4876.16] and how it was going it was really
[4872.84 - 4877.80] awesome I think that and you know
[4876.16 - 4881.32] sitting down and enjoying the food like
[4877.80 - 4885.08] I did was um was just really exciting on
[4881.32 - 4887.12] its own for me it just was
[4885.08 - 4888.52] um Sophie over there on YouTube says
[4887.12 - 4890.44] thank you for the light infused cards I
[4888.52 - 4892.84] saw that and the the message are going
[4890.44 - 4893.96] up but I think that like I want to talk
[4892.84 - 4897.76] about that too and we read some more
[4893.96 - 4899.48] notes but the light infused cards um
[4897.76 - 4903.16] it's what what I love about the light
[4899.48 - 4904.48] infused card infused cards is that
[4903.16 - 4907.60] Spirit of compassion doesn't just send
[4904.48 - 4910.24] the light down once on the cards it's
[4907.60 - 4911.76] like s so is sending light down a
[4910.24 - 4913.28] multiple times on the card so as I'm
[4911.76 - 4916.12] signing all those cards and they're
[4913.28 - 4917.92] being stacked up it's like every 10
[4916.12 - 4920.04] minutes I mean it took a long time to
[4917.92 - 4921.32] sign all the cards but every 10 minutes
[4920.04 - 4924.68] Spirit of compassion would send light
[4921.32 - 4927.00] down on the cards and that's just it it
[4924.68 - 4928.72] just it feels so good to see that okay
[4927.00 - 4932.32] so I got a note right here today I am

[5507.44 - 5515.36] BS like The Fakes out there you love and
[5510.80 - 5515.36] care for us like no other could
[5515.56 - 5520.40] except this mm
[5517.40 - 5520.40] family
[5520.44 - 5524.84] wow look I try not to like talk about
[5523.28 - 5527.04] like The Fakes out there or talk about
[5524.84 - 5529.16] the BS out there but I do every now and
[5527.04 - 5530.32] then I can't help it there's a lot of BS
[5529.16 - 5533.28] out
[5530.32 - 5534.92] there I think a lot of influencers that
[5533.28 - 5537.04] are in the health realm whether they're
[5534.92 - 5538.08] authors in the health realm or they just
[5537.04 - 5540.08] want to take advantage and they're
[5538.08 - 5541.84] running 20 billion ads at a time trying
[5540.08 - 5544.44] to sell their their courses or whatever
[5541.84 - 5547.04] they're doing I think that
[5544.44 - 5549.52] they they're they're like they see The
[5547.04 - 5554.08] Chronic eel as a cash cow you know like
[5549.52 - 5557.16] just one big fat massive Cash Cow you
[5554.08 - 5558.28] know and it's like and it's it's obvious
[5557.16 - 5559.52] like what do they really know about
[5558.28 - 5560.76] chronically ill and what do they know
[5559.52 - 5562.40] about people in they're suffering and
[5560.76 - 5564.72] struggling but they know this ch- ching
[5562.40 - 5567.20] ch- ching ch- ching they definitely know
[5564.72 - 5570.36] that you can see it everywhere out
[5567.20 - 5572.64] there I get it you have to make a living
[5570.36 - 5574.76] people have to make money yeah darn
[5572.64 - 5576.72] right and you should work and and try to
[5574.76 - 5578.04] do that if you can but there's a
[5576.72 - 5579.92] difference when it comes down to the
[5578.04 - 5582.52] health scene it's turned into a Feeding
[5579.92 - 5586.24] Frenzy of just
[5582.52 - 5586.24] sharks and
[5586.52 - 5591.32] Insanity did I say too much is Tik Tok

[5734.40 - 5738.20] for you just know it's doing something
[5736.40 - 5740.40] for you and then when you add on another
[5738.20 - 5741.84] medical medium tool boom and you add on
[5740.40 - 5744.48] another medical medium tool if you need
[5741.84 - 5747.92] to boom and then you do some shock
[5744.48 - 5750.96] therapy boom you know like a golden
[5747.92 - 5752.48] steal shock therapy or or a B12 shock
[5750.96 - 5754.64] therapy and you boom and you whatever
[5752.48 - 5756.12] you read the books and you'll learn and

[5756.12 - 5759.12] you know what I'm going to start with
[5757.04 - 5761.32] these three things in this protocol then
[5759.12 - 5762.76] am going to watch the bees yes and I'm
[5761.32 - 5764.80] going to watch the waves roll in on the
[5762.76 - 5766.76] beach and I'm going to add those tools
[5764.80 - 5769.08] at the same time I'm going to do a 28
[5766.76 - 5770.84] day cleanse I'm going to move to a 369

[5774.48 - 5778.68] going to do a heavy metal detox cleanse
[5777.04 - 5781.08] and then you just you take one day at a
[5778.68 - 5783.28] time and you chip away and you next
[5781.08 - 5784.96] thing you know it everything starts to
[5783.28 - 5787.12] heal and you start moving forward you
[5784.96 - 5789.24] start overriding it overriding the
[5787.12 - 5792.40] struggle and you're healing and you're
[5789.24 - 5792.40] moving forward
[5795.40 - 5800.08] boom Spirit of compassion just said
[5797.68 - 5803.32] don't forget to mention the spinach soup
[5800.08 - 5805.48] do not let Spirit compassion isn't using
[5803.32 - 5806.60] these words right here though do not let
[5805.48 - 5809.72] the
[5806.60 - 5811.80] morons of the health movement and the
[5809.72 - 5814.36] idiots of the health
[5811.80 - 5817.48] movement Spirit didn't use an
[5814.36 - 5820.80] idiot I added those I'm
[5817.48 - 5822.88] sorry but Spirit of compassion is saying
[5820.80 - 5825.80] do not underestimate the power of the
[5822.88 - 5829.00] spinach soup what that can do when
[5825.80 - 5832.60] you're using that on a daily basis to
[5829.00 - 5835.64] heal how powerful that tool is is
[5832.60 - 5837.08] just profound and what it can do for you
[5835.64 - 5839.56] is that spinach soup that's a medical
[5837.08 - 5841.88] medium tool right there and don't let

[5942.28 - 5946.76] amazing he touched my heart and reminded
[5944.76 - 5948.92] me of how important it is to strengthen
[5946.76 - 5948.92] the
[5949.72 - 5956.16] soul that's incredible and that you know
[5951.84 - 5959.00] and I the uh spirit of
[5956.16 - 5961.48] compassion it gave me a lot of words um
[5959.00 - 5963.96] in that moment and I don't use tele
[5961.48 - 5965.64] proops and I'm not using a teleop now
[5963.96 - 5967.92] and I never used tele
[5965.64 - 5970.00] propter
[5967.92 - 5974.68] ever and
[5970.00 - 5977.84] um and I don't practice for a speech and
[5974.68 - 5980.20] I never practice and I never have notes

[5991.20 - 5995.84] to help my team wherever I can and
[5994.12 - 5998.52] and uh and all that but I never think
[5995.84 - 6001.88] about the speech I never think about
[5998.52 - 6003.56] what I'm going to say I never use a
[6001.88 - 6006.32] telepromter or whatever you call it
[6003.56 - 6010.56] prompt or whatever and I don't and I
[6006.32 - 6013.72] just go on there in that moment and I
[6010.56 - 6016.04] listen to S SOC so I do I do cheat a
[6013.72 - 6019.64] little bit
[6016.04 - 6021.72] so I do I listen to Spirit of compassion

[6037.84 - 6042.84] incredible Talent like the guitar solo I
[6041.40 - 6046.88] didn't hear that
[6042.84 - 6049.36] either didn't hear any of it it was just
[6046.88 - 6051.40] basically I was just hitting notes as if
[6049.36 - 6053.88] it was in the air and I was singing
[6051.40 - 6055.92] words that were in the air because I had
[6053.88 - 6059.16] no monitors and no way to know what was
[6055.92 - 6060.60] happening but hey it didn't matter I
[6059.16 - 6063.20] just love being there and I loved
[6060.60 - 6063.20] playing for you
[6063.44 - 6066.88] guys this is so
[6067.16 - 6072.92] amazing so good Soul lightness Academy
[6071.56 - 6074.92] over there on YouTube when you were
[6072.92 - 6078.92] singing I couldn't stop listening your
[6074.92 - 6081.24] music was going directly to my heart
[6078.92 - 6084.12] that's more than I can ask for it's more
[6081.24 - 6086.76] than I can ask for now Alison the way we
[6084.12 - 6089.60] were all treated at Aran and the other
[6086.76 - 6092.20] venue is the true definition to comp of
[6089.60 - 6095.20] compassion we were so nurtured and cared
[6092.20 - 6097.12] for that is the best thing I can hear
[6095.20 - 6100.60] because that's what I was hoping and I
[6097.12 - 6103.72] was praying before it all happened and I
[6100.60 - 6106.48] wanted the the best feeling to occur and
[6103.72 - 6109.20] I wanted I wanted you guys to know how
[6106.48 - 6109.20] much I cared
[6110.08 - 6115.52] and this is hot just don't burn your
[6113.00 - 6117.64] tongue when you drink yours fly high
[6115.52 - 6120.56] said over there on YouTube guys there is
[6117.64 - 6122.56] an mm playlist on Spotify with all the
[6120.56 - 6125.52] songs from the
[6122.56 - 6129.16] event highly requested we did put out a
[6125.52 - 6129.16] playlist because it was highly highly
[6133.04 - 6138.24] requested I like making noise when I sip
[6135.52 - 6141.24] really hot soup so just bear with me
[6138.24 - 6143.92] rise of melum says YouTube the security
[6141.24 - 6146.36] at the event was very polite and
[6143.92 - 6149.20] respectful although there was a lot
[6146.36 - 6150.64] going on I really loved it so there so
[6149.20 - 6152.56] here's how it works with the security at
[6150.64 - 6154.92] the event security of the vent is to
[6152.56 - 6157.84] protect the medical meme
[6154.92 - 6159.40] Community you know it's to make sure
[6157.84 - 6162.68] that they're
[6159.40 - 6166.16] safe that's really what it is it's their
[6162.68 - 6168.64] I had my two guys you know like I had my
[6166.16 - 6170.40] guys right but the rest of the security
[6168.64 - 6172.68] is for the community because you just
[6170.40 - 6176.20] don't know who can just walk right in
[6172.68 - 6178.28] there it was a it was a private party it
[6176.20 - 6179.88] was a Afterparty it was a medical medum
[6178.28 - 6182.24] community Afterparty you just don't know
[6179.88 - 6185.24] who's can walk in you don't know so the
[6182.24 - 6185.24] security was to protect the
[6186.12 - 6190.76] community so they care about what I'm
[6188.32 - 6192.68] saying is they care about the community
[6190.76 - 6196.92] they're there for the community they're
[6192.68 - 6196.92] there for the event it just was a great
[6199.16 - 6203.12] thing it was just a music playlist is
