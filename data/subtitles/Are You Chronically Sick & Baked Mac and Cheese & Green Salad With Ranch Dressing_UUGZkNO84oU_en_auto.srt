be incredible too so I'm just peeling

163
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,360
some of these potato skins off because

164
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,280
you don't want your cheese to be brown

165
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,880
because you want the skins off I know

166
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,880
the Skins are so good for you people say

167
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,280
there's no protein in potato actually

168
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,639
there is protein in

169
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,199
potato really easily digestable really

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,840
easily

171
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,160
assimilable okay

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,479
really easy

173
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,240
protein so there you go because all you

174
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,800

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,160
a sick mind virus right where do you get

179
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,240

181
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,039

oven right now you guys know how I've

596
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,320
always talked about like toilets and

597
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,840
everything and I talked about great deal

598
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,960
and great length in the brain saver book

599
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,159
about when you use public bathrooms how

600
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,120
to be careful right how how I said put a

601
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,000
little just a sheet on top first of all

602
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,600
flush the toilet a couple of times

603
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,399
before you even sit down on there okay

604
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,919
and then put a sheet of toilet paper on

605
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,919
top of the water so you don't get that

606
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,840
water splashing up inside of you right

607
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,039
all the things that I've talked about

608
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,399
and and a go in detail in brain saer so

609
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,559
if you don't have the book get the book

610
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,960
but check this out right the toilets at

611
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,720
the event let's get into the a little

612
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,240
bit so the reason why they were first

613
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,559
class like

614
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,960
billionaire you know

615
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,360
toilets the reason why there were

616
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,000
toilets that you know like the top

617
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,039
billionaires on the planet probably

618
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,600
would use that an event and then again I

619
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,320
have no idea what they would use like

620
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,440
that if they would the reason why they

621
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,320
were that amazing is because I was

622
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,760
concerned because we're talking about

623
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,120
chronic illness we're talking about the

624
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,799
people in the medical medium community

625
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,159
and do I want the people in the medical

626
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,080
medum community stuffed in those tiny

627
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,279
little cheap pieces

628
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,559
portons do you think I want like the mm

629
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:38,880
Community stuffed in these little tiny

630
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:44,840
chemical bound highly toxic

631
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,679
chemical crap like dirty nasty portons

632
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,080
right that everybody uses in all the

633
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,600
events including burning man you think

634
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,279
with Burning Man the amount of money

635
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,919
people pay to go and do that Burning Man

636
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,840
thing you think like to get tickets you

637
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,039
think they would put a better bathroom

638
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,000
in burning man no they have people going

639
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,279
a bathroom in the field in the mud

640
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,960
that's where they're going to bathroom

641
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,519
over there right they're going to the

642
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,480
bathroom in buckets so so basically what

643
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,679
I'm trying to say here is instead of

644
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,840
using those really just those little

645
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,200
portons that are stinky and they're

646
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,399
toxic as hell and I got a lot of people

647
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,679
in the medical meme Community have

648
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,519
nervous system issues that they're

649
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,240
healing from all that

650
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:32,880
stuff you think I want them you

651
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,519
guys think I want everybody breathing in

652
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,320
highly toxic

653
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:39,440
chemical soups that are in those tiny

654
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,960
little portons and you're bumping into

655
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
the walls and you're banging your head

656
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,000
in there and you're dropping crap in the

657
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,600

went beyond the park it hit the lines I

707
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,399

728
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,960
and a green

729
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,039
leaf always go with the green leaf okay

730
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,799
romain's good for you it's a good

731
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,080
lettuce but it doesn't have what green

732
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:59,159
leaf has it's a stronger lettuce meaning

733
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,880
it's better for you the melage

734
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,600
okay mucilage in that

735
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,480
stem is a lot more medicinal and that's

736
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,880
important too so the medicine is in the

737
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,200
stem right there the base of it right

738
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,679
there's a lot of medicine in there so

739
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,440
it's not just in the greens with all the

740
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,679
vitamins and the

741
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,799
nutrients and the phy chemical compounds

742
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,880
and

743
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,600
everything right here in the green leaf

744
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,919
lettuce is that melage right there okay

745
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,320
and you see it the milk that milk more

746
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,760
more intense more medicinal so I like it

747
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,480
better than the Roma lettuce for that

748
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
reason so I just want to share that

749
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,200
there's so many things I can share and I

750
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,240
just never go to chance never get a

751
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,120
chance lightheart mama says I saw Tex

752
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,799

toxins toxins toxins there's no viruses

983
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,119
viruses don't

984
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,680
exist if you get tricked into viruses

985
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:13,599
don't exist if you get brainwashed into

986
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,400
viruses don't exist and you're sick it's

987
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,400
going to be a hard

988
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:24,319
Road A Hard Road all

989
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,720
right because let me tell you something

990
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:34,079
they do exist herpy simplex one one

991
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:37,200
herpes simplex 2 they do exist it is

992
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,119
real it is

993
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,520
real I'm going to make

994
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,240
a zucchini dressing in a bit so I'm just

995
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,880
preparing

996
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,800
this and those aren't the only viruses

997
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,960
stress and emotional turmoil can lower

998
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,240
the immune system allowing viruses to

999
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,839
increase their power increase their

1000
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:02,480
ability to spread and proliferate stress

1001
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:05,079
hardships right emotional

1002
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,839
turmoil it can lower the immune system

1003
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,400
for viruses to break out viruses to

1004
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,920
Surge

1005
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,200
okay all right I've always talked about

1006
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,800
this for years I've talked about it in

1007
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,480
the books and so forth check in the mac

1008
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,119
and cheese one more time don't want it

1009
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,359
burnt burnt I just want it nice and

1010
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,680

there just about ready all right

1012
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,119
it's got some tomatoes on the salad you

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,680
guys don't mind okay so yeah so what

1014
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:37,640
you'll find you'll find a lot of people

1015
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,880
like oh viruses don't exist it's just a

1016
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,160
de or or you'll find something like it's

1017
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,599
just a DNA strand it's R you know RNA

1018
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,079
strand that's all it is it's just a

1019
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,119
strand of something and that's what

1020
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:53,520
people say too they'll be like you know

1021
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,559
it's not it's not really a virus cell

1022
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,559
it's not a virus but it is viruses are

1023
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:03,480
viral cells they like to eat

1024
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,000
okay they Thrive they like to thrive in

1025
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,839
environments that they can eat toxic

1026
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,240
heavy metals they can not only eat toxic

1027
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,520
heavy metals but they can eat all kinds

1028
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,760
of poisons and different kinds of foods

1029
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:22,480
that viruses like okay viruses are real

1030
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,359
they eat they're hungry they want to

1031
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,079
live

1032
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:31,240
retroviruses also want to live viruses

1033
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:35,720
technically do not want to kill the

1034
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:38,720
host viruses don't do not viruses would

1035
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,040
prefer that you stay viruses would

1036
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,280
prefer that you stay relatively healthy

1037
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,000
so you can be a super

1038
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,200
spreader you

1039
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,920
know so you can spread Epstein

1040
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,240
bar and spread it far and wide viruses

1041
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,359
want you to be strong enough and healthy

1042
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,400
enough like a lot of people are out

1043
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:03,480
there as they're spreading the viruses

1044
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,559
setala virus hhv6 hhv7 herpes simplex 1

1045
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,720
herp Simplex 2 shingles viruses want

1046
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:13,079
people to be healthy enough to just

1047
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,000
spread Spread spread because the viruses

1048
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,680
want to live live live viruses don't

1049
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,680
want to

1050
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,040
die they

1051
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:32,160
don't viruses are are lab creat need it

1052
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,640
engineered they're

1053
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,640
engineered right in the labs and some

1054
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,720
are engineered in the labs to kill

1055
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,520
people right but even over time when

1056
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,480
it's been engineered in the lab to kill

1057
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,760
people as the virus goes through enough

1058
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,760
people it stops killing

1059
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,160
people doesn't kill them as fast even if

1060
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,640
they're engineered to kill people the

1061
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,440
viruses don't end up killing as many

1062
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,880
people ver you know getting to a point

1063
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,760
where they don't even kill hardly

1064
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,119
anybody because the virus ends up

1065
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,040
wanting to live forever Just Like a

1066
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,040
person wants to live

1067
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,960
forever but you'll see out there there's

1068
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,920
like a lot of new age thought and the

1069
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,559
new age thought is viruses aren't real

1070
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,359
they don't exist it's all these other

1071
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,119
reasons why people are sick yeah you

1072
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:31,400
keep on thinking that

1073
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:35,040
that is such a trap that is such a trap

1074
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,160
walking along here that's a trap boom

1075
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,839
you're

1076
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,839
down that's a trap that's a tiger

1077
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,920
snare I'd say like I don't know three

1078
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,400
more minutes maybe three more minutes on

1079
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,480
that I'm going to pop some cucumber on

1080
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,920
this okay so I'm not going to do the

1081
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,400
whole circles I'm going to do like the

1082
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,760
half

1083
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,240
Moons okay

1084
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,559
and shingles can cause somebody the

1085
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,160
worst debilitating pain shingles can

1086
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,359
make somebody so miserable they don't

1087
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,160
even want to live

1088
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,880
anymore epine bar can create a situation

1089
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,760
in people where they got Ms multiple

1090
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,440
sceris diagnosis or they get a you know

1091
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:21,680
fibro diagnosis an RA

1092
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,359
diagnosis okay herpes simplex well that

1093
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,000
can do a lot of things can get into the

1094
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,240
brain stem it can get into the central

1095
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,800
nervous system in so many ways Herby

1096
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,440
simplex one two the point is is that

1097
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,520
these viruses live in everybody they sit

1098
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,960
there they percolate they want to be

1099
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,440
spread they want to live and they also

1100
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,440
you know keep the person miserable over

1101
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,440
time

1102
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,440
and so knowing how to heal is knowing

1103
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,640
how to pulverize and beat those viruses

1104
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,880
to

1105
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,160
death that's the key it's not so much

1106
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,480
the key as detoxing detoxing detoxing

1107
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,880
detoxing you know that that's that's a

1108
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,119
that's a word that many people in the

1109
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,599
health movement in the last 40 years

1110
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,079
said because they didn't know anybody

1111
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,240
was sick with viruses they didn't know

1112
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,599
anybody was sick with viruses the

1113
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,480
hygienic movement is a prime example of

1114
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,880
how they had no idea no conception that

1115
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,400
viruses were causing any of the illness

1116
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,000
I know because I talked about I talk to

1117
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,160
Natural hygienist throughout the years

1118
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,280
holistic hygienists the movement doctors

1119
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,079
and people in the health field for the

1120
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,960
last 40 years I've talked to many they

1121
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,119
had no clue what caused his illness at

1122
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,160
all besides oh the person's toxic the

1123
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,520
person's toxic take this rout do this

1124
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,839
try this the person's to water fast for

1125
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,440
three weeks the person's toxic that'll

1126
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,720
fix them you know many people water fast

1127
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,160
for 3 weeks came out of that water fast

1128
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,160

again but worse than they ever did

1131
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:59,920
because the water fast wasn't killing

1132
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:01,960

1133
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,559

00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:42,319
of radishes real quick right I just cut

1168
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,319
the root off of the radish of course you

1169
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,079
could eat it if you want but I do cut

1170
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,079
the little root off right there I mean

1171
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:53,079
you might like chewing on the

1172
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,599
root but but your guest might not like

1173
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:56,200
it your guest might be sticking a fork

1174
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,400
in that and being like what is this it's

1175
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,200
chew

1176
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,880
what's going on here so I'm just

1177
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,880
preparing a few

1178
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,280
radishes I've been in the health scene

1179
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,839
for a long

1180
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,839
time very long

1181
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,240
time not

1182
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:27,000
by a wanting to or that's what I want to

1183
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:30,040
do I was forced into it at a young age

1184
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,119
AG starting at 4 years

1185
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:37,559
old with Spirit of

1186
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:39,200
compassion who I argued with many many

1187
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:42,079
many a

1188
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,000
time because of it

1189
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,040
all and what I have discovered was

1190
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,559
nobody knew viruses were behind all the

1191
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,359
symptoms conditions neurological

1192
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,440
symptoms all the different illnesses

1193
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:53,440
they had no

1194
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,480
idea toxins

1195
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,839
were the only thing anyone ever said and

1196
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,839
that was

1197
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,520
it so I'm going to slice up some of

1198
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,160
these radishes I'm doing half Boons on

1199
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,160
them if you guys are okay there we

1200
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:17,760
go Spirit of compassion told me that the

1201
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,640
viruses are a huge part it's not just

1202
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,880
toxins and what toxins it's another

1203
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:27,280
thing too back years ago 20 30 years ago

1204
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,839
it was just toxins do it water fast cuz

1205
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,839
it was just

1206
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,000
toxins what

1207
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,839
toxins no one knew toxic heavy metals

1208
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,680
were giving people all the different

1209
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,920
symptoms and conditions that they've

1210
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,079
learned about with the medical medium

1211
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,480
books today that they poached and you

1212
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,079
know go around and even though there's

1213
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,440
no studies behind it because it comes

1214
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,760
from mm

1215
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,680
info but the point I'm trying to say is

1216
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,359
I see people still stuck in the mud out

1217
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,440
there they're sick they ain't never

1218
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:58,440
going to heal they ain't

1219
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,920
and it's sad because they think viruses

1220
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:07,240
don't exist or they think a water fast

1221
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,680
is going to fix everything and meanwhile

1222
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,400
they're not left with the correct

1223
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,839
information after they recover from a

1224
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,839
water fast this is just one example or

1225
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:15,880
maybe they think they need a cold plunge

1226
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:18,240
themselves

1227
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,720
crazy while they're damaging their

1228
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,400
adrenals people want quick fixes man

1229
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:28,359
they want quick fixes but the truth is

1230
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,359
they don't know why they're sick

1231
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,400
and you have to know why you're sick you

1232
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:34,160
got to know when metals are causing the

1233
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,240
problems when it really is Metals that's

1234
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,760
right you have to know when it's viruses

1235
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,720
and it's really viruses and you have to

1236
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,119
know other stuff too Marg says it feels

1237
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,640
like everything else has forgotten about

1238
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,799
health

1239
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,280
history only aw is talking is talking to

1240
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,520
us about what trends were out there and

1241
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,280
crazy thoughts that's true I don't see

1242
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,680
anybody talking about it out there

1243
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,559
because a lot of people in Health right

1244
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,799
now on social social media they're all

1245
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:06,400

1247
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,079
the press they got into it six years ago

1248
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,240
four years ago three years ago two years

1249
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,400
ago last year and they're just shouting

out stuff and you know and the whole bit

1251
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,040
but they don't know they don't know the

1252
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:19,640
history they don't know what happened

1253
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,119
and then there's bacteria turning into

1254
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,359
Super

1255
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,359
bugs there's that too all right we got

1256

some

1257
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:29,119
radishes there's strep

1258
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,039
right but you know the industry thought

1259
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,280
strep only did a certain thing but no

1260
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,319
does a lot more causes a lot more

1261
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,039
problems all

they are but deficiencies

1268
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,079
don't explain it all on how somebody's

1269
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,359
sick and how they have viral

1270
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,640
inflammation and bacterial you know

1271
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,160
infections low grade and low grade and

1272
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,599
high grade and the differences between

1273
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,720
low grade and high grade and all of that

1274
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,559

here just want to show you right here

1279
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,559
it's cooling down enough for me to take

1280
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,920
my hands and actually really put it on

1281
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,520
here show you

1282
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,680
guys there it is can't wait to crack

1283
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,599
into

1284
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,839
it all right I'm going to get a blender

1285
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,039
over here but I'm going to grab this

1286
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:42,039
first right

1287
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:51,960
here okay three cups raw peeled DIC

1288
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,319
zucchini I'm going to peel these

1289
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,559
zucchinis right

1290
00:56:53,319 --> 00:57:02,039
now really quick

1291
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,039
is what I'm going to do boom so all

1292
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,480
right and then keep this in mind okay so

1293
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,559
it happens all over again you think

1294
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,000
you're getting somewhere and you think

1295
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,760
you're getting the information out there

1296
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,680
you think people are are getting the

1297
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,240
information they need and then boom

1298
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,599
viruses don't exist anymore oh viruses

1299
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,599
don't eat

1300
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,079
anything I think one of the most

1301
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,760
powerful powerful pieces of information

1302
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,760
to actually use to

1303
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,400
is knowing that a bug eats something and

1304
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,640
then learning what the bug eats so you

1305
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,559
can withhold that certain food from the

1306
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,599
bug and when you can withhold that food

1307
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,920
from the bug like

1308
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,799
cheese I've never ripped apart the whole

1309
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,960
dairy industry I've never done the whole

1310
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:51,599
radical vegan thing where the vegans

1311
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,920
like they get so crazy they burn down

1312
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:57,559
buildings you know right I'm not I'm not

1313
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:01,119
whatever I'm not p on vegans that's not

1314
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:03,520
it it's the reason why s

1315
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:07,520
so went for the

1316
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,640
cheese the dairy and said you can't have

1317
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,119
that in if you're sick with these bugs

1318
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,680
these certain viruses because certain

1319
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,559
viruses will feed on that Dairy and feed

1320
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,920
on that cheese okay it's not because of

1321
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,200
any other reason you can be plant-based

1322
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,799
vegan doing medical medium using the

1323
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,880
tools in healing I said this so many

1324
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:28,920
times and you could be animal protein

1325
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,039
you using medical medium tools and

1326
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,000
healing but there's certain things that

1327
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,520
are critical if you're sick with chronic

1328
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,280
fatigue if you're sick with all the

1329
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,200
different conditions and

1330
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:42,839
symptoms it's knowing that cheese will

1331
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,520
feed a bug now here's the deal if you

1332
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:46,119
get told well cheese isn't good for you

1333
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,520
it's inflammatory maybe because they

1334
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,720
learned it's inflammatory from medical

1335
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,640
medum information because remember Dairy

1336
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,839
wasn't inflammatory all these years

1337
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:58,280
that's mm info Dari was not inflammatory

1338
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,480
it it was just it was a vegetarian thing

1339
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,839
vegetarians ate Dairy cuz Dairy was

1340
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:08,880
healthy supposedly right healthy nobody

1341
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:11,480
knew nobody knew that Dairy fed bugs

1342
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,440
that Dairy feeds viruses that's medical

1343
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,359
meme info but when you learn that piece

1344
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,799
of powerful information it really keeps

1345
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:20,720
you from eating not eating the dairy in

1346
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,039
that moment and then somebody will say

1347
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,920
I'm going to go and punish medical

1348
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,680
medium out there and talk crap about him

1349
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,039
and I'm going to show like a cheese dish

1350
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,000
and say I'm not restricted medical

1351
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:34,079
medium restricts everybody from eating

1352
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,799
cheese I can eat cheese right here look

1353
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,720
sure of course you can but if you got

1354
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:39,480
chronic sickness and illness and you got

1355
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,400
MS symptoms and you got neurological

1356
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,839
Lyme symptoms and you got every symptom

1357
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,599
ALS symptom under the all kinds of Under

1358
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,680
the

1359
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:49,160
Sun all

1360
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,359
kinds right you're going to want to stay

1361
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,280
away from the cheese and when you learn

1362
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:58,039
why you should stay away from the

1363
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:00,240
cheese boom you can move forward it's so

1364
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:02,200
important and then hey you get yourself

1365
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,119
better you get rid of the bugs you kill

1366
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,520
off those viruses you learn how to do it

1367
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:08,280
through medical medum information you

1368
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,640
pulverize and destroy those bugs and

1369
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,920
they leave your system yes they detox

1370
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,520
out of your system once you kill them

1371
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,799
and you want to eat a piece of cheese

1372
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,920
because you had your heart set on it

1373
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:18,920
then you eat a piece of cheese

1374
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,880
whatever all right I'm going

1375
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,000
to pop some zucchinis in here this is

1376
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,079
one right

1377
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,039
here I'm taking these skins and moving

1378
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:36,400
them

1379
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:38,680
over you saw what this floor looked like

1380
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,760
right now everything just went on Amanda

1381
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,799
says I never felt right with dairy but

1382
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,440
then I got addicted to ice cream chronic

1383
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,319
UTI disappeared as soon as I eliminated

1384
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,240
the dairy and other no Foods the reason

1385
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:54,520
why is because the dairy was feeding the

1386
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,400
strep that creates the UTI that's how it

1387
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,119
works but nobody knew that it didn't

1388
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,000
exist never existed out there it's mm

1389
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,000

to chop up and throw kind of into it

1602
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,440
later I blended it in

1603
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,679
there we

1604
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,679

now you go

1609
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,239
make a little

1610
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:46,600
B there we go

1611
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,600
this

1612
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:04,239
one all right just going to clean up a

1613
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,239
little bit

1614
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,320
all

1615
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,560
right you guys I'm going to pour a

1616
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,159
little bit of this on the

1617
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:44,480
salad or actually have it on the side is

1618
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:44,480
what I'm going to do get a new bow

1619
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,560
here can I put this right here

1620
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,120
chop up a little dill and put it on

1621
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,600
top sprinkle a little bit on top of

1622
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,960
here grab a

1623
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,600
spoon okay so here's a dressing now what

1624
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,960
happens is when you have guests they may

1625
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,159
want the dressing on the side they may

1626
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,760
not want it all put on top of your salad

1627
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:34,480
and mixed in so I just did a side one

1628
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,400
right here as you can see okay um and

1629
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,719
then somebody can put it on their salad

1630
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,320
