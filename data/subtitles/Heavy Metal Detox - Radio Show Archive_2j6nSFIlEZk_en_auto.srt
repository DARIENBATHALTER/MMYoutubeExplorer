not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,520
ahead of what's out there now as I've

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,119
always said who has 10 or 20 or 30 years

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,640
to wait for answers to their illnesses

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,760
life is precious and there's no time to

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,720
spare someone told me recently you

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,080
you don't have crazy women's syndrome

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
which is what they they documented years

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,199
ago and they said women were all crazy

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,919
that had a symptom you don't have that

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,759
you know it isn't just hormones cuz

132
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,720
hormones are blamed on everything now is

133
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,560
it isn't just genes because genes are

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,520
now the new thing blame everything on

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
genes see what happens is the medical

136
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,960
Industries they just don't have answers

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,919
so then they sell even alternative

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
medicine they sell them Concepts okay

139
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,080
now it's your genes everybody of course

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,600
we have genes of course genes are

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,039
actually real of course genes are in our

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,440
bodies of course we have hereditary

143
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,479
traits of course we have DNA but that's

144
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,360
not why we're sick that's not why we're

145
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,199
sick that's the newest crap being fed

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,000
into everybody so we have to wait

147
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,240
another 30 years for real

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,840
answers and then we're told you know

149
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,080
it's blamed on us once again you have

150
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:05,360
faulty jeans you just got crappy junky

151
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,199
dirty jeans and that's why you're sick

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
okay and oh yeah let's improve on your

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
jeans let's write a whole bunch of books

154
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,440
on how your jeans could get better it's

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,240
ridiculous There's real reasons why

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,000
everybody's sick so yeah when it comes

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,000
down to it who has 10 or 20 or 30 years

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,360

162
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,360
happened when I came into this world

163
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,280

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,280
viruses these tox toxic heavy metals you

183
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,800
got Mercury aluminum copper can you guys

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,440
name a few cadmium lead arsenic nickel

185
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
and there's probably more I'm not even

186
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,720
thinking about chromium Okay Chrome not

187
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,400
chromium but like Chrome okay yeah

188
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,879
Chrome alloy you name it Steels Steels

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,280
you name it they get into our system

190
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,479
they find their way in and we're going

191
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,479
to talk about how they find their way in

192
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,840
we're going to talk about you know how

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,720
long they've been in there and that's

194
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,800
what's really interesting how long these

195
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
medals have been there and you're

196
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,639
probably thinking well I don't know as

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,680
long as I've lived so far no no even

198
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,159
longer than you've lived so far in your

199
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,879
life isn't it

200
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,000
interesting so we're we're going to head

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,159
in there listen how is the life-changing

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,879
Foods book did I let you down I just

203

204
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,000
down I killed myself on that book think

205
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,319
so if you're unhappy with what's in

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,680

you're happy with what's in there and if

208

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,880
it's really I mean I I think it's a

213
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,399
really good book because Spirit gave me

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,959
the information um and I I got it all in

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,800
there and uh and I I was even blown away

216
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,160
I was blown away by spirit's information

217
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,240
I was blown away and that's what happens

218
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,680
when spirit gives me the information I I

219
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,760
that's that's one of the perks about the

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,760
job of hearing Spirit since age for is

221
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,360
you know you get to hear this stuff

222
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,120
coming in this new profound information

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,079
coming in from Spirit and then you know

224
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,680
I get to hear it and be like whoo that

225
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,200
that blows me away so it's exciting so

226
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,560
um I I I love the book I hope you guys

227
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:15,800
love it I really do um so okay let's go

228
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,079
into this show let's do this show uh I'm

229
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,959
excited about this I really am heavy

230
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,160
metals um am I obsessed about toxic

231
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:28,720
heavy metals maybe so sometimes okay

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,640
maybe so but there's a real valid reason

233
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,399
and I've given you some of the history

234
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,399
before I've talked a little bit about uh

235
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,680
about that history in book one so you

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,920
you're probably aware of some of that

237
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,800
history already I've talked about it

238
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,120
before and I'm going to talk about it

239
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,320
again but give you a little bit more um

240
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,040
to it though cuz this is exciting about

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,160
the heavy metal detox and heavy metals

242
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,600
and everything else first of all you

243
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,320
know when it comes down to toxic heavy

244
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,200
metals do they give us symptoms yeah

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,880
they can they can give us ADHD add they

246
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,040
can give our children ADHD add really

247
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,200
easily Focus concentration problems they

248
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,040
can increase our viral issues like

249
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,480
viruses like Epstein bar feed off of

250
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,279
toxic heavy metals and then when that

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,200
happens we get more tired and more tired

252
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,760
and more tired we can get brain fog

253
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,920
irritability frustration we can get sibo

254
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,720
from toxic heavy metals and what's sibo

255
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,760
do you guys know by now probably you

256
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,519
folks know by now sibo is uh strepa

257
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,440
cacus even though practitioners don't

258
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,920
know that yet they just don't doctors

259
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,360
don't know that they just think it's an

260
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,680
overgrowth of bacteria they don't really

261
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,959
know what kind it's antibiotic resistant

262
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,880
strep strep Aus and that's you know

263
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,160
that's exactly what sibo is so um toxic

264
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,079
heavy metals tend to per uh like grow

265
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,120
and overgrow and bring that back in um

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,480
UTI okay that's you can when you have

267
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,000
elevated toxic heavy metals urinary

268
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,720
tract infections sinus infections sinus

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,760
problems you can easily catch more colds

270
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,959
and flu acne yes acne too on top of it

271
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,800
because acne is strep and an underlying

272
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,920
chronic systemic strep and affection

273
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,600
that's just percolating in the body for

274
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,480
years and years and years even from

275
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,800
childhood fatigue you can get headaches

276
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,800
migraines anxiety different bouts of

277
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,399
anxiousness different BS of anxiety

278
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,200
different forms of depression all from

279
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:38,959
toxic heavy metals and you can get OCD o

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,120
OCD can develop and get worse over time

281
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,519
do you know anybody who deals with OCD

282
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,760
do you know anybody who's dealt dealt

283
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,760
with it have you dealt with it and it

284
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,800
goes on and on and on so let's go into

285
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
some history a little bit let's go into

286
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
some history first of all I said earlier

287
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,399
I said before I said we have these toxic

288
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,079
heavy metals and they're in inside of us

289
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,079
and they're inside of us before we're

290
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,040
even

291
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,959
born what does that mean and and and how

292
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,480
does it work first of all the heavy

293
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,839
metals that are inside of us are older

294
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,760
than us they're older than us so the

295
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,320
original ones that we come into the

296
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,240
world with and we we're born with these

297
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,920
original toxic heavy metals such as

298
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,279
mercury and even some lead and you know

299
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,320
and some aluminum but especially Mercury

300
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,720
could be as old as a thousand years

301
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,560
thousand

302
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:45,519
years now it doesn't mean what I mean by

303
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,320
a thousand years the earth created that

304
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,279
mercury um you know before it was mined

305
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,360
long before a thousand years okay but a

306
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,320
thousand years ago and a little bit past

307
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,600
a thousand year i' probably go back even

308
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,600
two 3,000 years ago it was starting to

309
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,600
be mind okay it was it was worked

310
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,320
meaning there was there were people

311
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,639
digging it out of the earth digging it

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,519
out of the earth and um and not

313
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:15,519
cultivating it but Gathering it for use

314
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,880
and there was never a good use for

315
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,120
mercury ever was definitely one of the

316
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,880
blunders of humankind of mankind without

317
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,680
a doubt but the Mercury that's inside of

318
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,040
us can go back generation Generation

319
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,720
generation Generation generation and

320
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,320
keep on going 50

321
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,839
Generations okay 60 Generations 80

322
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,279
Generations 80 great great great great

323
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,440
great great great grandma and grandpas

324
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,480
okay and keep on going you know you can

325
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,000
use your imagination on that one and see

326
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,360
how far it takes you you can even play

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,320
with the math can go back a good couple

328
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,480
thousand years and so you know that's

329
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:02,279
that's basically how it works with us so

330
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,800
this toxic heavy metal goes for the ride

331
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,040
doesn't leave the body of anybody it

332
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,160
stays in the bodies stays in the cells

333
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,839
it gets passed on generation and we get

334
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,560
more intolerant to it in fact this time

335
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,000
around in the last 30 years we're more

336
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,680
intolerant to it than ever before in

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,839
history and our children are paying the

338
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,880
price and and I'm talking about new

339
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
Mercury that's entering into our bodies

340
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,240
now too through all all kinds of

341
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,639
different facilities I mean all kinds of

342
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,000
different ways uh it's falling out of

343
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,519
the sky it's dropping out of the sky out

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,040
of the air out of PLS it's Dr it's

345
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,480
floating in the sky it's in the

346
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,880
waters okay it's all over the place it's

347
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:53,680
in um our food okay it's in medical

348
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:56,720
stuff so it's in medical you know

349
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,720
medications it's in you know uh things

350
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,560
like that it's in places it's all over

351
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,839
the place I mean just look at

352
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,600
antibiotics antibiotics Harbors

353
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,959
petroleum so petrol fuel oil engine oil

354
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,360
as in

355
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,360
antibiotics engine oil and lots of

356
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,800
pesticides too because they're you know

357
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,199
genetically altered corn grain grown on

358
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,160
the planet for pharmaceutical use

359
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:33,920
sprayed with IM immense amounts of heavy

360
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:37,600
metal laced copper um aluminum Mercury

361
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,480
pesticides okay um mixed with petroleum

362
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,319
based engine oils yeah crazy right put

363
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,480
into an antibiotic capsule antibiotics

364
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,839
can be uh created without all that by

365
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,040
the way antibiotics you can you can make

366
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,680
an antibiotic and minus all that garbage

367
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,079
every bit of it just so you know so it's

368
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,480
there and and here's the thing that's

369
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,720
just literally an

370
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
antibiotic but when it comes down to

371
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,480
having Mercury in our systems from long

372
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,519
ago you might say well would if what if

373
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,279
nobody used mercury in my family in my

374
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,360
family line you know like how can I have

375
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,680
mercury in me from the old day you know

376
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
we can have mercury in us for the new

377
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,040
day did you ever have a can of tuna fish

378
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,319
did you ever have tuna did you ever have

379
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,920
um something else I'm trying to think

380
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,279
now what other options and which other

381
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,199
ways I know people who played with

382
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,279
broken thermometers I know people who uh

383
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,240
who family-owned dentistry and they

384
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,800
played with you know Mercury balls

385
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
running in their hands and running on

386
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,959
the floors when they're children and

387
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,839
little girls and little boys playing

388
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,319
with Mercury and there's just ways of

389
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,399
getting it it's in other places too it's

390
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,759
in pesticides sprayed inside homes so I

391
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,440
mean you could be growing up in a home

392
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,079

look at you for a moment and then they

418
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,000
would mix a nice big glass of water

419
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,640
mixed with part Mercury and you would

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,480
drink this Mercury Elixir this Mercury

421
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,039
tonic it's all through the 1700 and

422
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,960
1800s now well you could argue and say

423
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,559
well you know what my forefather

424
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,640
probably didn't go to a doctor that gave

425
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,960
a Mercury tonic no not true every single

426
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,600
doctor every medical doctor every

427
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,720
conventional

428
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,320
doctor U Mand

429
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,640
upon entering that doctor's office

430
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,120
getting exam you ingested a Mercury

431
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,840
tonic didn't matter what what what what

432
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,080
when where who you are what you are

433
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,520
child adult baby it didn't matter you

434
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,440
drank a Mercury tonic now the problem

435
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,960
with this is that it was not only

436
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,159
dangerous but it caused a lot of trouble

437
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,600
and the trouble it caused was before

438
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,480
you'd go to the

439
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,200
doctor you would get ready for the

440
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,880
Fallout if you were married and had

441
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,640
children um chances are your wife and

442
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,039
kids would lock down the house locked

443
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,559
the doors before you came back home and

444
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,000
made you stay away for a week before you

445
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,039
entered the home again so it meant loss

446
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,520
of work loss of family communication you

447
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,679
name it because when you went to the

448
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,159
doctor's office and you had a Mercury

449
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,520
Elixir you you became insane this is

450
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:32,919
well known you became insane it was

451
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,039
called quack quackery being quacked now

452
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,720
I'm going to tell you right now about

453
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,320
the whole quackery thing the whole quack

454
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,679
thing right now in our modern day in the

455
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,440
moment if you hear the word quack you

456
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,520
think it's an alternative doctor an

457
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,679
alternative

458
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,520
healer um an herbalist chiropractor that

459
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,559
has different thinking Homeopathy

460
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,159
homeopath that has different thinking

461
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,240
because quack has been associated with

462
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,679
anybody in alternative medicine that's

463
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,559
that's what quack has been associated

464
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,799
with so the whole quack thing's been

465
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,720
dumped on good doctors practitioners and

466
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,440
healers but let me tell you where quack

467
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,760
came from quack came from medical

468
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,440
doctors the term quack came from if you

469
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,600
went to the medical doctor they would

470
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,200
quack you they would quack you that's

471
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,200
right because they were the quacks they

472
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,480
were the quacks because when you went

473
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,240
into that that medical office and you

474
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,640
drank that mercury tonic for whatever

475
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,080
ailed you you went insane you became

476
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,080
quacked that was the quackery you went

477
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,120
home quacked and what happened is that

478
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,000
you'd go home chances are you could kill

479
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,480
your family you could do something

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,080
horrible you can there's there's stories

481
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,799
of just drooling for weeks and talking

482
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,360
Rhymes and R riddles and children's

483
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,360
Rhymes you end up in you can end up in

484
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,159
an alley for a week 3 days 4 days

485
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,280
depends on how severe the quackery

486
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,760
occurred this happened for hundreds of

487
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,520
thousands of people through the 1700s

488
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,600
and 1800s both abroad and here in the US

489
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,679
Okay the reason why you don't hear a lot

490
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:10,039
about it is because it was an absolute

491
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,120
epic disaster of I mean Epic Proportion

492
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,640
massive

493
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,159
disaster Abe Lincoln was Ill from

494
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,120
quackery himself meaning he had severe

495
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,640
depression from mercur Mercury Elixir

496
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,520
everyone experienced quackery at one

497
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,679
time it was horrendous so what happened

498
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,480
was everybody got wise they got wise and

499
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,640
they stopped going to doctors didn't

500
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,600
matter if they broke a darn leg they

501
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,480
wouldn't go to doctors and the medical

502
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,640
industry fell apart lost all its money

503
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,559
and hit rock bottom hit rock bottom you

504
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,279
won't hear that anywhere oh of course

505
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,320
not cuz we don't want to visit that God

506
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,240
forbid we don't want the truth to come

507
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,159
out the fact that in the 18 by the late

508
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
1800s nobody went to the doctor in men

509
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,120
medical universities weren't funded

510
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,919
anymore and everything was on such low

511
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,480
battery it was literally at a crash

512
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,200
point of non-exist existent doctors had

513
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,080
empty offices across the country no

514
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,159
matter what the case was because

515
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,880
everybody got wise to it they didn't

516
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,480
want to lose their lives anymore they

517
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,400
didn't want to lose their wives and

518
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,760
their kids and their families and their

519
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,640
jobs and that was quackery Quicksilver

520
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,799
is what it was it was so detrimental so

521
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,279
devastating to the people and that's

522
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,440
where the term came from guess how guess

523
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,640
what it was flipped it was flipped all

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,640
of a sudden you're alternative

525
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,200
practitioner oh you're a quack flipped

526
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,240
what a great way of flipping that what

527
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,679
happened was by the late 1800s because

528
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,120
nobody went to the doctor anymore and

529
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,279
the medical universities were out of

530
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,240
business and there was no funding

531
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,520
anymore and everything crashed the

532
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,799
alternative movement exploded it came

533
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,440
out of

534
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:53,720
nowhere homeopaths the first one

535
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:57,400
chiropractors the very first ones thank

536
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,080
God naturopaths naturopathy very first

ones meaning they were always there in

538
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,159
the in the back doing their thing but

539
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,440
they were ostracized they were beaten

540
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,279
down for a long time herbalists came out

541
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,799
healers came out and the birth of

542
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:17,279
alternative medicine was

543
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,840
born and in order to actually get the

544
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,320
conventional world back the conventional

545
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,120
medicine world back in order they put

546
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,919
out advertisement saying you go to the

547
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,360
chiropractor you're you're going to a

548
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,240
quack because decades a couple of

549
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,400
decades later people forget you know

550
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
decades two decades later you kind of

551
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,360
forget about some of the mistakes and

552
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,360
the main medical world advertised we no

553
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,279
longer carry Quicks over we no longer

554
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,080
deal with the Elixir so people trusted

555
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,760
him again went back to them again and

556
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
then the word quack was pushed on the

557
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
alternative doctors now the reason why

558
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,279
I'm talking about this is when your

559
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,559
great-grandparents and and your family

560
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,360
in the olden days in the 17 1800s they

561
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,679
drank those toxic Elixir and they

562
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,279
suffered consequences for a little while

563
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,080
and that mercury is still in their that

564
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,679
was in them passed on to the next

565
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,039
generation passed on Next Generation

566
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,320
Next Generation could have got passed on

567
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,799
to you and it could be in your cells CU

568
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,840
it is in your cells it's in all of our

569
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,440
cells you can't can't excape it so why

570
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,279
don't we get some of that Old Mercury

571
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,080
out of us because we're getting

572
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,120
intolerant to it and we can get that

573
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,919
stuff out of us and we can also get the

574
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,159
new stuff and here's here's something

575
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,679
about how Mercury works just so you know

576
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,799
Mercury gathers on its on itself it GA

577
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,200
it gathers it it um comes together you

578
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,559
can have Old Mercury in you or Mercury

579
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,640
that you got in you 10 years ago and if

580
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,640
you get new Mercury in you it comes

581
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,799
together it comes together it finds

582
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,240
itself it it's like two raindrops next

583
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,720
to each other on some glass and then you

584
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
just kind of rub them together and they

585
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,880
come to one you know two drops of water

586
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,240
can come together become one

587
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,960
drop that's how Mercury works so just so

588
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,880
you

589
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,840
know Mercury keeps on building on itself

590
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,679
and it could get more toxic over time if

591
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,000
you have a little bit of mild OCD and it

592
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,240
seems like it's getting worse part of

593
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,360
that could be it could be collecting

594
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,039
some more Mercury so we have to get it

595
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,440
out if you have anxiety and it tends to

596
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,159
get a little bit worse or it's getting

597
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,159
worse over the years could be collecting

598
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,600
a little bit of more Mercury there same

599
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,840
with depression now here's how it goes

600
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,360
everybody has toxic heavy metals in a

601
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,640
different area

602
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,159
of their

603
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,440
brain in a different area it's not all

604
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,320
the same you can have it in left

605
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,720
temporal load lobe you can have it in

606
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,080
the frontal lobe you can have have it in

607
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,799
the bottom of the frontal lobe you can

608
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,799
have it near the pituitary gland you can

609
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,640
have it in so many different places in

610
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,960
so many different

611
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:57,080
ways okay you can have it

612
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
anywhere anywhere in the brain and you

613
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,919
can have different different levels of

614
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,600
heavy metals little bit of mercury a

615
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,760
little bit of lead a little bit of

616
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,279
aluminum a little bit of copper someone

617
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,600
might have more lead some arsenic some

618
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,200
nickel and some Mercury someone might

619
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,080
have all Mercury a little bit of

620
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,200
aluminum everybody's different the apple

621
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,039
pie is different the recipe is different

622
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,360
for every single person so what does

623
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,080
that mean someone's depressed but in a

624
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,840
different way someone's got anxiety in a

625
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,000
different way hey you know how's how was

626
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,080
your depression working well mine is

627
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,919
kind of where I feel lonely all the time

628
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,039
well that's not my depression my

629
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,840
depression is I feel an emptiness well

630
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,240
that's not my depression my depression

631
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,399
feels I feel like a like a dark Cloud's

632
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,159
over my head raining hey that's not my

633
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:48,720
depression my depression is I I can't I

634
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,919
it's a it's a depth of Sorrow that can't

635
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,559
be explained that's not mine and it goes

636
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,600
on and on and on and

637
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:00,039
on and then we just classify it as just

638
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,600
depression same thing with anxiety I'll

639
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,000
say what's your anxiety like someone

640
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,960
might be like well I just can't sit

641
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,360
still I'm like really that's not bad at

642
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,640
all because that's different than

643
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,760
someone else I've heard where they feel

644
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
like jumping out of their skin and they

645
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
want to jump into a lake you know

646
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,760
everybody's different some people say

647
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,159
hey I my anxiety is so bad I haven't

648
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,799
eaten in a week I can't put food in my

649
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,720
stomach it's flipping too many times

650
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,880
everybody's anxiety is different to a a

651
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,320
a serious degree and why is that because

652
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,960
the toxic heavy metals can be in

653
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,520
different parts of the brain on

654
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,360
everybody but not only that they could

655
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,080
be

656
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,679
alloy alloy is a mix they're running off

657
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,880
each other they're they're helping each

658
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,679
other they're ricocheting off each other

659
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,039
they're reflecting frequency of the

660
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,960
different heavy metals are reflecting

661
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,720
off of each other aluminum reflecting

662
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,279
off of Mercury Mercury reflecting off of

663
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,559
copper you know an alloy is like a mix

664
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,679
of metals to make something stronger so

665
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,440
and lighter your bicycle you know they

666
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,760
don't make bicycles like they used to

667
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,559
bicycles like they used to were just

668
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,039
like

669
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,000
iron were they were like go to a tag

670
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,279
sale or an old antique shop and pick up

671
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,320
an old bicycle and break your back

672
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,000
putting that damn thing in the uh back

673
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,600
of your truck or car I mean it weighs

674
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,159
weighs a 400 lb I mean I'm sure it

675
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,480
doesn't weigh 400 lb but it could feel

676
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,960
like that and now bicycles today they're

677
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,360
light as air you can pick it up you can

678
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
put it on the back of your car it's

679
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,080
alloy it's it's a of metals make it

680
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,679
lighter and stronger well we have Alloys

681
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,159
in us at this point there's so many mix

682
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,799
of heavy metals plus alloy itself is a

683
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,480
group of metals we can get contamination

684
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,000
from all on its

685
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,960
own so there's a reason why we have all

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,159
these different symptoms and these

687
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,159
different levels of symptoms different

688
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,640
levels of brain fog and then when you

689
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,360
put viral components to it you guys you

690
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,279
put viral components to it like a virus

691
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,919
eating some toxic heavy metal a virus

692
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:07,080
eating Mercury a virus eating aluminum a

693
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,880
virus eating some arsenic then you have

694
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,919
something entirely different you get a

695
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,279
lot of different symptoms got a lot of

696
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,840
different Epstein bar symptoms because

697
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,279
Epstein bar likes a lot of heavy metals

698
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,600
and then it eats them bugs eat heavy

699
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,720
metals um chews them

700
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:28,080
up um goes the bathroom releases them

701
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,120
and they become more methylated

702
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
dangerous and they interfere with their

703
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,960
own

704
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,840
methylation which we're doing a

705
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,799
methylation show uh coming up I promise

706
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,039
we're going to do the MTHFR gene

707
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,279
mutation which is com total complete

708
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,919
confusion and has to be corrected at

709
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,519
least here at this show to start with so

710
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:48,240
that there's some hope that there's

711
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,679
actually some hope so we're constantly

712
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,039
not going down the wrong direction all

713
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,600
the time with misinformation out there

714
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:57,320
so so what happens is you know when the

715
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,039
virus feeds off heavy metals it releases

716
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,200
neurotoxic versions of those heavy

717
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:06,799
metals causing more anxiety more

718
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,840
Depression more memory loss more brain

719
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,720
fog and it can do that even without

720
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,919
viral intervention you can still have

721
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,960
OCD you still can have anxiety can still

722
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,320
can have memory loss with just heavy

723
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,039
metals themselves because they can run

724
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:26,880
off they can oxidize

725
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:30,919
oxidation these Metals oxidize and leech

726
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:35,279
they Lee into other tissue of the brain

727
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:39,120
liver organs the pancreas spleen they

728
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,240
get everywhere so we want to clean these

729
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,360
Mercury aluminum lead components out of

730
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,600
our body because it's really that

731
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,760
important because it could really get in

732
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,840
the way and I'm not just talking about

733
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,480
anxiety and depression I'm talking about

734
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,159
you know irritability frustration I'm

735
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,360
talking about like I said bacterial

736
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,039
overgrowth the brain fog of course

737
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,559
dizziness

738
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,440
anything um you can get migraines

739
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,799
headaches chronic migraines and

740
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,679
headaches you can have the shingles

741
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:08,200
virus involved eating a lot of heavy

742
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,080
metals we can have both things happening

743
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,919
at

744
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,799
once and this intolerance that we have

745
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,880
to toxic heavy metals is what's is is a

746
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,000
big part of what's happening and I talk

747
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,600
about it life-changing Foods you have

748
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,880
the um unforgiving for toxic heavy

749
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,279
metals are one of the unforgiving four

750
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,240
right we did that show on it you got you

751
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,519
got the radiation you got the viral

752
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,600
explosion that occurred in the last 100

753
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,120
years and 100 plus years and you have

754
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,480
all this going on but the toxic heavy

755
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,080
metals are kind of like a foundation

756
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,799
kind of like where you know where do you

757
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,039
want to go with your health to jump

758
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,080
started how do you want to change your

759
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:48,399
life how do you want to make something

760
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,440
better let's get the heavy metals out

761
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,440
and you'll start seeing things getting

762
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
better I want to tell you another story

763
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,399
of where we can get you know toxic heavy

764
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,360
metals from the past could say hey look

765
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,440
I did research on my genetic line my

766
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,799
family line we didn't drink any toxic

767
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,519
Elixir what what are you talking about

768
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,000
Anthony well did anybody in your family

769
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:16,559
line ever wear a felt hat at all ever a

770
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,480
felt hat going back from

771
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:24,159
1950 on down to,

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,120
1800 to 1780 do your research see if

773
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,799
anybody wore a felt hat somebody because

774
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,840
it was practically mandatory to wear a

775
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,519
felt hat as a man and what was soaked

776
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,639
into that felt hat Mercury lots of it

777
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,000
too off the charts we're talking off the

778
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:43,559
charts dangerous levels and amounts of

779
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,799
mercury were soaked into felt hats hat

780
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:51,559
makers had a 3 to 5ye

781
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:55,480
life um or what I should say you know um

782
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,600
we have 3 to 5 year uh sentence life

783
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,399
sentence is what I'm trying to say that

784
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,440
means that they had 3 to 5 years before

785
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,880
they died or became so ill from the

786
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,799
Mercury dipping the hats in the Mercury

787
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,039
Solutions when you became a hat maker it

788
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,000
was called and I'm not just talking

789
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,120
about say one aspect of hat making I'm

790
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,919
talking about the area of hat making

791
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,639
where you actually have to treat the

792
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,320
hats if you entered into that area of

793
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:23,080
hat making you didn't live long it was

794
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,200
called Mad Hatters so that's what it was

795
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,440
called Mad Hatters disease so you you

796
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,799
know was Mad Hatters mad is a Hatter

797
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,960
because you went utterly insane when you

798
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,039
worked with felt hats for a little while

799
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,080
but wearing felt hats lots of mercury

800
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:41,519
absorbed into the brow of every man in

801
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,519
every country Europe to the US so that's

802
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:49,080
also in our past and does this matter

803
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,000
yeah it matters because here's the deal

804
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,480
what you

805
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,960
see doesn't hurt you I guess that's the

806
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,000
that's the society we're in today and

807
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,399
planet Earth right here today it's like

808
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,639
you don't see it then it can't be

809
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,960
hurting you I don't see it so it can't

810
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:06,200
be hurting you oh you got symptoms Mrs

811
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,639
Jones um I think you're crazy or lazy or

812
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,399
bored because I can't find anything

813
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,000
wrong with you at the doctor's office so

814
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,520
maybe you're making it up maybe it's all

815
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,399
in your head back in I mean this has

816
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,280
happened in the 20s the 30s the 40s the

817
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,679
50s the 60s how many people went to the

818
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,480
doctor oh your exam looks fine so your

819
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,440
depression your hot flashes all the

820
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
different things that you're going

821
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,359
through your night sweats your anxiety

822
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,200
um your pains your aches and pains your

823
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,440
fatigue your chronic fatigue everything

824
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,800
must be in your head until the hormone

825
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,359
movement came on and then everything was

826
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,000
blamed on menopause which is a whole

827
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,399
another thing um which is all botched up

828
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
which is you know a whole another

829
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,200
botched up thing that we can talk about

830
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,960
that we have talked about we could

831
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,440
always talk about again down the road

832
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,879
but you know if we don't see it this is

833
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,320
the kind of world it is if I don't see

834
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,040
you catch that fish you said you caught

835
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,960
and you don't have a photograph of it to

836
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,280
prove it I don't think it

837
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,079
happened and that's the kind of society

838
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,560
we live in you know oh you're

839
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,040
storytelling oh maybe you're

840
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,839
storytelling on how sick you really are

841
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,440
there's a lot of teens and 20year olds

842
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,040
and um and young adults and and that are

843
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,400
actually suffering they go to college

844
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,880
they get sick they can't function

845
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,720
anymore they come back home they're

846
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,240
bedridden there's nothing wrong with

847
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,880
them doctors can't find anything and

848
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,800
they just lay they sick and they get

849
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,400
told they're making it up that they just

850
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,599
don't want to engage in life and then

851
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,200
the lime disease Saga came into town

852
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,320
where since now no one knows what's

853
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,079
wrong with anybody everybody gets a lime

854
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,119
diagnosis everybody does doesn't matter

855
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,880
what you do you just get a lime

856
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,880
diagnosis now we're going to do another

857
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,440
lime show down the road um so but the

858
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,760
point is it's got to see it to believe

859
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,200
it and if you don't see it it didn't

860
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,000
happen it's not true or it doesn't exist

861
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,200
it doesn't exist you can't see heavy

862
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,200
metals you can't see them I mean you

863
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,079
just can't see him if you saw the

864
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,200
mercury in a can of tuna then you would

865
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,839
you would know you would see it it would

866
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
shine it'd be like you open your can of

867
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,000
tuna and say whoa that's a lot of

868
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,760
mercury in this tuna today guess I'm not

869
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,319
eating it but you can't see it it's a

870
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,680
lusive it's the hidden

871
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:22,000
antagonizer that's the whole point and

872
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,920
so it's hard to say ah maybe I got some

873
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,920
heavy metals in the past maybe it's

874
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,359
creating a symptom I don't know can't

875
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,680
see it Dr can't see it got to take it

876
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,800
seriously because it's not genes that

877
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,560
are taking us down right now it's the

878
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,560
intolerance to toxic heavy metals being

879
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,760
one of them we're getting intolerant to

880
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,880
it our children are this is why children

881
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,560
are suffering with autism at this point

882
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,680
autism and you know um an ADD and ADHD

883
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,520
and more than that all kinds of

884
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,960
different disorders hundreds of them

885
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,280
actually could name them list after list

886
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,480
because of mercury intolerance toxic

887
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,040
heavy metal int tolerance we're at this

888
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,680
this point we're at this crazy point

889
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,640
right now in time in history where we

890
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,960
have to clean up so what do I like to do

891
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,720
what do I like to use to clean clean the

892
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,200
metals up the heavy metal detox the

893
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,839
heavy metal detox some of you guys are

894
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,079
probably doing it you folks are probably

895
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:24,119
actually doing the heavy metal detox

896
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,640
right now I'm sure and so what's in the

897
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:31,160
heavy metal detox what makes it so good

898
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,920
why does it matter because in the heavy

899
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:38,720
metal detox there are five components

900
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,000
five components that grab metal hold on

901
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,640
to it and take it to the end they take

902
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,319
it to the end what that means is it

903
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,960
doesn't let the metals go and

904
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:56,720
redisperse back into your bloodstream

905
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,800
redisperse back into your organs

906
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,839
redisperse back into places in your body

907
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,760
back into your brain and so forth so

908
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,680
let's talk about these

909
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,920
ingredients one is spirulina I don't

910
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,920
care what you've read I don't care what

911
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,880
you see what someone told you it is by

912
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,079
far way by far better than any Corella

913
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,119
I'm going to talk to you about Corella

914
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,319
for a second Corella is the clumsiest

915
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,440
most

916
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:30,720
irresponsible incompetent

917
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,359
substance not anybody who recommends it

918
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,359
it has nutritional value like Corella

919
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:40,319
has nutritional value it is good for you

920
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,040
in many ways I don't recommend it

921
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,960
because it really stinks at Gathering

922
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,800
heavy metals I'll tell you why because

923
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,440
it drops them Picks Them Up drops them

924
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,560
that's what it does it doesn't pick them

925
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,000
up out of the brain it can't go that far

926
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,960
so it's not one of those kind of heavy

927
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,119
metal reboot removal systems you know

928
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,640
Corella it doesn't pick it out of the

929
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,880
brain it doesn't get it out of the liver

930
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,560
really it's basically its only option is

931
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,160
to get it out of the intestinal tract

932
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,800
but when it picks it up out of the

933
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,200
intestinal tract it drops it again

934
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
before it can even take it out before it

935
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,920
can even bring it out of the body

936
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,760
Hawaiian spirina won't do that it

937
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,319
doesn't have that dropping effect and if

938
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,079
it does have any dropping effect at all

939
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:29,680
it's going to synergistically work with

940
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,079
the barley grass juice extract so that's

941
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,200
why you need the barley grass juice

942
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,119
extra extract I like vimergy that's my

943
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,319
favorite one but the barley grass juice

944
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,839
extract combined with the spirulina work

945
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:44,240
off of each other the

946
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,440
spirulina likes to get the metals out of

947
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,400
the brain it likes to get the metals out

948
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,520
of the central nervous system the liver

949
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,000
the barleygrass juice powder um that one

950
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,560
likes to get it out of the spleen

951
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,240
intestinal tract the pancreas the

952
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,319
thyroid the the reproductive system and

953
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
they work off of each other and then

954
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:06,079
cilantro it's another one to throw into

955
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,920
the to the bag of goods here cilantro

956
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,560
goes into Deep hardto Reach places it

957
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,480
goes back for the Mercury of the past

958
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,040
the Mercury of the past I'm telling you

959
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:22,960
about that's tormenting our world as we

960
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:27,160
speak now people giving them symptoms

961
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,119
that you can't explain so Sal goes deep

962
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,440
in the deep down and gets them gets it

963
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,040
from places of yesty year and then just

964
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,440
when cilantro gets a little lazy and

965
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,720
it's trying to make it to the finish

966
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,359
line and if it drops that mercury now it

967
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,960
drops that toxic heavy metal that

968
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,280
aluminum the wild blueberries are there

969
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,599
and the wild blueberries are the most

970
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,040
powerful by the way powerful ways of

971
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,160
getting toxic heavy metals out of the

972
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
body out of the brain they go right to

973
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,680
the brain they pull them out of the

974
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,480
brain but what the wild blueberries do

975
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:07,000
is they fill in the spaces Where Metal

976
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,480
was left Where Metal left off I mean

977
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,839
metal oxidizes leaves little pockets and

978
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,520
if you've heard that somewhere else that

979
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,359
came from me it came from here it's the

980
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,319
only place that ever came from along

981
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,560
with a lot of the information we we

982
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,000
share here I say that in case you get

983
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,400
lost you might go somewhere well they're

984
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,040
talking about that too but what's going

985
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,480
to happen is there's a trap probably

986
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,680
going to be laid out where then it goes

987
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,800
off into Corella or it goes off into the

988
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,119
MSO or it goes off to something else so

989
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,319
just you know this is the way to do it

990
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,960
right here so the wild blueberries goes

991
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,400
deep into places pulls out toxic heavy

992
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,839
metals in Pockets hard to- reach places

993
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,560
where it's oxidizing and leeching off

994
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,920
causing memory issues causing you to

995
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,640
forget your car

996
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,720
keys and then it starts to fill in those

997
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,440
Pockets by repairing tissue radically

998
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,160
repairing tissue with the antioxidants

999
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,440
that wild blueberries

1000
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,079
possess so that's the power of the wild

1001
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,119
blueberries and the wild blueberries

1002
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,720
pick up where others may drop along the

1003
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,760
way the barley grass the cilantro the

1004
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,720
spirina they work off each other it's a

1005
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,280
team and then you got the Atlantic douls

1006
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,520
it's a sea vegetable Atlantic douls it's

1007
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,079
a sea vegetable d u LS e and you can get

1008
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,040
Atlantic Sea dolls I like main Coast sea

1009
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,359
vegetables for their

1010
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,720
that's my favorite but you might be

1011
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,200
somebody out there that reads something

1012
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,880
and you might find that seaweeds or dos

1013
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,480
or any kind of seaweed comes from the

1014
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,319
ocean so the oceans are getting polluted

1015
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,599
they got mercury in them and they got

1016
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,000
radiation in in them and everything else

1017
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,040
so you might say well I'm not going to

1018
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,640
eat any seaweed what's he talking about

1019
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,440
you're just going to pollute your body

1020
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,160
that's not how it works you can take the

1021
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,400
dirtiest piece of Dos out of the

1022
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,599
slimiest ocean we have on the planet and

1023
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,079
chances are if you consumed it it would

1024
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,160
draw more out of you then it would leave

1025
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:12,400
behind all the way to the end cuz

1026
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:15,359
seaweed doesn't let go it doesn't let go

1027
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,599
that's how seaweed works it opens the

1028
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,359
capacity to pull in more absorb like a

1029
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,599
sponge and take out that's what it does

1030
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:28,319
so Atlantic Sea dols is not slimy and

1031
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:31,680
it's not dirty and it's amazing stuff

1032
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,480
and incorporate a little bit of that too

1033
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,920
and what you can do is pull Metals out

1034
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,359
from yester year I like it look I like

1035
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,040
my heavy metal detox smoothie I like two

1036
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,920
bananas two cups of wild blueberries I

1037
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,200
get the Frozen wild blueberries two cups

1038
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,680
one cup of

1039
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:53,440
cilantro one cup of orange juice okay I

1040
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,800
use the fresh stuff I'll squeeze oranges

1041
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,280
I'll just squeeze them with my hand

1042
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,599
right into the right into the cup and

1043
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,200
then scoop out the pits or seeds you

1044
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,640
know or you can you orange juice you

1045
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,520
know um squeezer whatever an orange

1046
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,760
juice squeezer juicer or if you don't

1047
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,720
have any other options get your purest

1048
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,880
healthiest orange juice even if it's

1049
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,240
pasteurized get your purest healthy

1050
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,599
pasteurized orange juice um that has no

1051
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,920
preservatives whatsoever in it and

1052
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,839
nothing else in it and you can pour use

1053
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,119
that if you really had to you can also

1054
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:30,119
in the rest of the um ingredients would

1055
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,800
be like the barleygrass juice powder one

1056
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,280
teaspoon one teaspoon of Spirulina you

1057
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,559
don't have to use a lot if you don't

1058
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:43,440
want to one small handful of Atlantic

1059
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:46,599
dolls and you got yourself the heavy

1060
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,440
metal detox now you know you can you can

1061
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:51,400
make a smaller one if you want do what

1062
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,000
you feel that you want to do I like

1063
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,800
doing celery juice too I like having

1064
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,599
that on the same morning because it's it

1065
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,599
with that the heavy the the mineral

1066
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,680
salts from the celery juice they provide

1067
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,720
like a secret weapon of flushing helping

1068
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,440
flush the metals out of the liver while

1069
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,640
you're extracting them so it's you know

1070
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,280
kind of gives everything kind of a heaw

1071
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,839
push uh heave along the way and gets

1072
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,400
things out so I like the the um celery

1073
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,440
juice so I want to talk about what like

1074
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,280
why we be these heavy metals out and why

1075
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,400
this is so important to do this heavy

1076
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,440
metal detox because

1077
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,480
neurotransmitters are getting affected

1078
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,359
in us from these toxic heavy metals

1079
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,720
neurotransmitter

1080
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,720
chemicals are being destroyed when we

1081
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,400
have memory problems when we have brain

1082
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,680
fog when we have confusion when we just

1083
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,079
have kind of brain fatigue when we have

1084
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,400
even other kinds of kind of just not

1085
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,400
feeling like motivated mild depression

1086
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,760
to severe depression you know anxiety

1087
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,359
different levels of anxiety and the list

1088
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,960
goes on

1089
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:04,839
neurotransmitters get damaged and short

1090
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,680
circuited from toxic heavy metals so you

1091
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:10,200
have a neuron in your brain okay

1092
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,160
electrical nerve impulse is running

1093
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,119
through that neuron running across that

1094
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,480
neuron it's

1095
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,240
driving with the use and help of a

1096
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,839
neurotransmitter chemical that's sitting

1097
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,800
on that neuron so the neuro the

1098
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,200
electrical nerve impulse is running

1099
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,599
across that neuron running across that

1100
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,800
Highway

1101
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,079
and it's and it's it's fuel is that

1102
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
neurotransmitter and our

1103
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,720
neurotransmitters are getting burnt out

1104
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,119
in this day and age it's not

1105
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,119
genes that are given up on us you know

1106
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,640
we don't have these bad genes cuz since

1107
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,880
nobody knows what's wrong with anybody

1108
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,040
in chronic illness I'm going to be

1109
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,960
straightforward and honest I'm not

1110
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,280
talking about when you break a leg and

1111
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,640
there's bone fragments and you get an

1112
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,680
x-ray and the doctor knows where they

1113
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,960
are I'm not talking about you know um

1114
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,280
liver transplants and heart transplants

1115
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,680
I'm not talking about when your

1116
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,720
gallbladder explodes cuz it got you know

1117
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,480
obstructed from a big Stone I'm not

1118
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,839
talking about obvious stuff that we

1119
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,520
catch on CAT scans and we have you know

1120
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:12,000
ways of measuring it ways of weighing it

1121
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,359
I'm not talking about neurosurgery for

1122
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,640
getting an aneurysm out of somebody's

1123
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,200
brain these things are

1124
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,160
incredible you know and and and I have

1125
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,000
tremendous respect and admiration to

1126
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,280
doctors and surgeons and conventional

1127
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,160
medicine and I'm talking about chronic

1128
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,960
illness literally almost everything else

1129
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,480
is a mystery it's a mystery right now I

1130
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,200
don't care what anybody says it's a

1131
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,319
mystery and and we need to put the

1132
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,559
answers out there I got to be that voice

1133
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,240
like I was saying for everyone I have to

1134
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,559
and then hey you can be the voice too

1135
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,240
with me that's what I'm hoping just deep

1136
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,240
down inside I'm hoping you're the voice

1137
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,520
with me uh you know and that because

1138
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,599
that's the whole point if we're the

1139
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,520
voice together that's even that's even

1140
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:59,200
better it doesn't get any better than

1141
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:01,240
that and and so it's about this kind of

1142
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,200
information that's so critical it's

1143
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,839
about that oxidation that's happening in

1144
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,119
the brain the neurotransmitter chemicals

1145
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:10,240
in the brain it's not genes going wrong

1146
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,599
that's just another way of of everybody

1147
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,480
you know if con the conventional world

1148
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,680
and it falling back on the alternative

1149
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,720
world now because there's so many

1150
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,640
conventional doctors that went

1151
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,200
alternative that they kind it all comes

1152
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,760
over shifting over that blame on us is

1153
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,440
being driven

1154
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:30,200
over to the once complete and total pure

1155
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,720
view of the alternative M movement it's

1156
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,520
been flipped over on us these ideals

1157
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,160
like for instance you know autoimmune

1158
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,720
disease is your body attacking itself

1159
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,720
wrong we know that we've explained that

1160
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,280
a million

1161
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,760
times a bunch of times it feels like a

1162
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,920
million times but I'll just keep on

1163
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,920
going a million more same thing with the

1164
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,680
genes like that it's all blamed on genes

1165
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,440
now it's not so we got these toxic heavy

1166
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,520
metals burning out

1167
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,480
neurotransmitters it's fixable

1168
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,640
it's it's

1169
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,040
healable it can get better we can get

1170
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,119
our neurons better we can get rid of the

1171
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,119
oxidation the corrosion of the metals

1172
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,240
out of the brain we can get the

1173
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,760
electrical nerve impulses stronger and

1174
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,440
better we can get the lights back on in

1175
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:20,240
our bodies we can get the lights back on

1176
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,680
in our bodies and we can heal and head

1177
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,000
in the right

1178
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,319
direction and I've said this before once

1179
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,040
before if you had a street

1180
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,960
and it was blocked with a whole bunch of

1181
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,559
metal barrels and you ran your car right

1182
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,400
into it you'd smash right into it and

1183
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,480
that's what heavy metals like when it's

1184
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,319
in our brains and it's in our liver and

1185
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,559
it's in other places when these

1186
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:45,480
electrical impulses these frequencies

1187
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,799
they're driving through our body to give

1188
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,720
us Vitality they run into these metal

1189
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:52,920
barrels and they just short circuit they

1190
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,760
crash they s short circuit do you ever

1191
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,280
know anybody it could even be you do you

1192
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,559
ever know anybody that's like like well

1193
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,040
I had a short circuit I couldn't get

1194
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,280
that thought I couldn't think about it

1195
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,040
anymore or I got post-traumatic stress

1196
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,400
syndrome from this whole thing going on

1197
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,200
or I that's too hard for me even to go

1198
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,880
there or to think about you know I can't

1199
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,280
that's just it's blowing up my head do

1200
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,720
you ever run into anybody like that

1201
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,160
where something's like blowing up their

1202
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,079
head and they can't go there because

1203
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,400
their emotions take over because what a

1204
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,920
lot of what's happening is when you have

1205
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,119
high heavy metals you get these short

1206
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,000
circuits because electrical impulses

1207
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:31,440
start flying in different directions cuz

1208
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,160
it's hitting different various metals

1209
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,040
and the information of what someone's

1210
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,400
telling you or something happening or

1211
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,440
something emotional is happening you

1212
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,880
can't bear it you can't bear it you

1213
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,680
can't handle it cuz all kinds of you

1214
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,880
know short circuiting is happening this

1215
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,960
doesn't mean that you're crazy no this

1216
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,880
means that you're totally sane and then

1217
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,720
some and then some it just means you got

1218
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,440
some things that are toxic heavy metals

1219
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,079
that are in there so when something is

1220
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,920
too much

1221
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,520
or when something when something's too

1222
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,480
heavy on you it's hard because the

1223
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,040
neurotransmitters can't handle the load

1224
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,720
the electrical impulses are running into

1225
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,599
little deposits of metal and this

1226
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,440
doesn't mean a lot of metal you know

1227
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,640
when I do scans on

1228
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,079
people and and we're going to do we're

1229
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,240
going to do some more of that too we're

1230
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,119
going to have some fun and take on

1231
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,520
callers in the future not in the show

1232
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,000
but in the future and when I do scans on

1233
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,640
people I see the heavy metals inside the

1234
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,440
brain they reflect like Christmas tree

1235
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:34,000
lights like if you were outside looking

1236
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:37,960
inside a warm house you know on a

1237
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,640
December day or December evening and

1238
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,040
it's dark outside and the lights are on

1239
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,280
in the house and the Christmas trees

1240
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,000
through the window the big picture

1241
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,119
window and all the lights are coming

1242
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,400
through I can kind of see it like that

1243
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,280
these lights light up all through

1244
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,160
somebody's body and the deposits of

1245
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,559
metal they have and when if I go into a

1246
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,599
place that's busy and there's a lot of

1247
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,119
people around and man I see those lights

1248
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,880
lighting up everywhere we got lots of

1249
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:02,920
heavy metals in us and it's time to get

1250
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,559
them out and so we're going to work

1251
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,599
together on this this this is exciting

1252
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,680
you can unfasten your seat bels now you

1253
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,280
can take a deep breath and relax and

1254
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,640
take your seat belt off the heavy metal

1255
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:18,040
talk is always always

1256
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,240
intense so look along with the heavy

1257
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,119
metal detox which is seems so simplistic

1258
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,839
once again it's two bananas two cups of

1259
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,799
wild blueberries one cup of cilantro one

1260
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,680
cup of orange juice one teaspoon of

1261
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:31,880
