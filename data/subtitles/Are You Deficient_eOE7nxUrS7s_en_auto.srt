we come in this world efficient

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,680

their parents were deficient

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,079

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,519

whatever's gonna happen

311
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
so

312
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
what are we gonna do about it

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,720
that's what i wanna know so i have

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
spirit of compassion

315
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
right

316
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
what are we gonna do

317
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
and it's like we do the tools we bring

318
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,600
them into our life

319
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,440
we get medical devices

320
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,760
that will probably someday be outlawed

321
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,040
i wouldn't doubt it

322
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,560
if 15 years from now you're not allowed

323
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,000
to have a juicer in this world

324
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
your doctor will have to write a

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
prescription to see if you're eligible

326
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
for a juicer

327
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,040
okay

328
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
not to mention 15 years down the road

329
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
you might not be able to grow your own

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
fruit tree in your yard

331
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
because

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,760
the forces of evil want to take

333
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,760
everything away from everybody

334
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,920
infect them

335
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,560
make them sick and poison them

336
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,279
contaminate them and then take away the

337
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
things they need but right now we have

338
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,600
these things we have the medical device

339
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,760
right here now we can do something about

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,760
it

341
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,360
right yeah

342
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
they're going to take away b12 years

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,519
down the road they're going to take away

344
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,000
other things down the road

345
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,480
fix what you need to fix now

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120
work on what you need to fix now

347
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
right and hopefully hopefully

348
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
hopefully

349
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,079
the light is fighting for us

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,880
and we get to keep things like juicers

351
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
and

352
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
b12 and

what kind of

365
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,519
spiritual brainwashing is that what

366
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
direction is that

medical device

548
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,320

anything that you run through it

556
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,080

get lost along the way they weren't

599
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,880

611
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360

it's the light

667
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
okay

668
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
it's the light

669
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,919
it's not like something toxic like

670
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,679
vinegar something toxic

671
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,400
right

672
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,080
or nutritional yeast with msg

673
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,559
right

674
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
or something else

675
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,840
millions of dollars hundreds of millions

676
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,720
of dollars are being put into that to

677
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,000
brainwash you that's dirty

678

that's dirty

679
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,679
that's dark and dirty that's what that

680
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,000
is that's not of the light because a

681
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
those things don't fix anybody b

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,880
hundreds of millions of dollars are

683
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
being put into it to brainwash you while

684
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,200
it's not fixing you

685
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,279
right that's nasty

686
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,960
this is pure

687
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,559
this is pure

688
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
of the light

689
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,200
right when you drink this you can

690
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,440
actually be rest assured that there

691
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,679
isn't hundreds of millions of dollars

692
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,000
trying to brainwash you being spent

693
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,279
every day on television all over the

694
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,919
internet on youtube ads ads to trick you

695
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,480
into trying something

696
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,559
this is because people got better

697
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
and they tell another person

698
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,159
that's what this is

699
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
so this is of the light right here

700
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,240
and that's the difference

701
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,520
think about that

702
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,279
and that's the difference

703
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,400
please talk about the urine therapy

704
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,360
craze yeah it's ridiculous doesn't work

705
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,400
it was around forever it never worked

706
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,400
it's a bad idea

707
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,039
and it doesn't work

708
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,440
yeah

709
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,080
it's it's it's it's actually

710
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,240
it's actually a ridiculous idea

711
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,760
i've watched it for years

712
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,400

713
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,840

anybody's sick long enough who hasn't

716
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,159
tried it did it fix them no it didn't

717
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,159
but here's the thing

718
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,559
you might do some urine therapy

719
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,480

it's toxic

730
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
it's really a bad idea

731
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,679
first of all

732
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,720

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
for the liver

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,400

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,040
want with your lymphatic system

lymphatic massage you can do all these

952
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,760
things but unless you fix the liver and

953
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,680
clean it up

954
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
you'll just be chasing

955
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,079
your tail

956
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,520
you'll chase your tail

957
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,200
and there's only theories about what

958
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
makes the lymphatic system good or bad

959
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,920
or what helps the lymphatic system it's

960
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,119
just theories

961
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,560
theories that develop from people that

962
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,320
don't even know why anybody's sick to

963
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,640
begin with

964
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,040
but that's the tail chasing problem

965
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,040
happens i'm trying to fix my lymphatic

966
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,920
system trying to fix my lymphatic system

967
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,839
what you got to be fixing your liver is

968
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
what you got to be fixing or you're just

969
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,839
chasing your tail that's what you feel

970
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,359
like that dog that chases the tail until

971
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,720
you've got to try to stop the dog and

972
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,040
say it's okay you don't have to chase

973
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,200
your tail anymore

974
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,680
that was fun but we got to stop chasing

975
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,680
our tail

976
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,880
your lymphatic system's only as good as

977
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,400
your liver stagnant sluggish livers is

978
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,880
what everybody has

979
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,280
that's how the weight comes on

980
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,079
and the overflow of that toxic liver

981
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,920
goes into the lymphatic system

982
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,160
the overflow of that toxic liver goes

983
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,960
into the lymphatic system i have to say

984
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,800
it twice if i don't because here's what

985
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,040
happens everybody thinks oh the

986
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
lymphatic system that's where to go hey

987
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,240
i'm talking to another person about

988
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,320
lymphatic system

989
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,640
yeah i'm taking this new lymphatic

990
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,599
system product right here said i'm doing

991
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,359
uh what who's lymphatic system product

992
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,960
like didn't even know why you're sick

993
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,320
and you're taking just a hush posh stuff

994
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,720
thrown together

995
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
like a theory

996
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,320
here's the thing

997
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,400
medical medium information gets people

998
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,160
better because not only

999
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
does it make sense

1000
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,520
but because there's a real reason

1001
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,760
why it works

1002
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,640
you can't clean your lymphatic system

1003
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,560
unless that liver is cleaned up

1004
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
your lymphatic system is your dumping

1005
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,160
ground

1006
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,480
it's your garbage can for the liver

1007
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,160
liver gets over filled it gets stagnant

1008
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,079
sluggish and it pours all into your

1009
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,359
lymphatic system and you can play with

1010
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,800
that lymphatic system all you want

1011
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,320
but until

1012
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,880
you do what you need to do and that's

1013
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,960
one of the tools right there can you do

1014
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,040
something for it there's a lot of bad

1015
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,839
ideas out there

1016
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,520
okay

1017
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,839
and in order to heal you've got to know

1018
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,680
how to weave in and out of them

1019
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,920
bypass them it's like driving your car

1020
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,520
into a pothole you see or you see

1021
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,599
something on the highway like a rubber

1022
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,640
tire that popped off a truck

1023
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,640
right

1024
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
you see a top pieces of tire all over

1025
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,560
the highway with metal sticking out of

1026
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,440
the tire right you're on the highway

1027
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,880
okay

1028
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,800
what do you do you just you just run

1029
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,839
right over that tire

1030
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,000
65 miles an hour is that what you do

1031
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,400
when you do that you're eventually gonna

1032
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,839
pop your tire and go off the road and

1033
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,880
crash

1034
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
and possibly die

1035
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,960
so mm info is so we don't have to weave

1036
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,960
so we can you know don't have to just

1037
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
run over those tires

1038
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,839
so instead we can be like whoa we got a

1039
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,359
tire coming let's get around it whoa

1040
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,920
wait a minute i was just sold on a whole

1041
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,440
lymphatic drainage program i spent three

1042
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,280
thousand dollars on when i could have

1043
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,960
purchased a ten dollar medical medium

1044
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,640
book and found out that the liver needed

1045
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,640
to be cleaned up let me weave around

1046
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,640
that tire oh the tire boom boom

1047
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,200
and then for a street cred i got to

1048
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
mention it because it just gets stickier

1049
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,240
and stickier and uglier uglier out there

1050
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,680
each year after each year

1051
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,320
and the ghouls come out

1052
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,040
is what they do

1053
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,480
pure and of the light there isn't

1054
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,400
hundreds of millions of dollars going

1055
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,400
into this to get you to drink it every

1056
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,960
day on television there isn't anything

1057
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,800
nothing just people getting better while

1058
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,560
people out there are getting sicker and

1059
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,200
sicker and sicker

and herbal extract it's not going to

1065
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,599
happen by just having a celery stick

1066
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
sure sure

1067
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,640

great

1073
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,960
right

1074
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,960
you shouldn't be eating tuna fish

1075
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,640
you can pop a few pieces in your tuna

1076
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,079
fish salad but you shouldn't be eating

1077
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
tuna fish right

1078
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
right

1079
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,720
you can definitely have right here you

1080
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,359
can have some celery pieces

1081
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,119
my dogs love celery pieces

1082
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,760
right but i actually give my dog some

1083
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,680
celery juice

1084
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,680
the celery pieces aren't enough

1085
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,520
you guys a couple of notes on

1086
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,560
deficiencies

1087
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,560
we got to put back in the tank

1088
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,319
we got to get we got to get it back in

1089
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,319
the tank it's like that boat the water's

1090
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,720
filling in you can't shovel it out fast

1091
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,640
enough and the boat sinks

1092
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
and right now the world's getting to a

1093
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,240
place

1094
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,000
where they're hitting you on all sides

1095
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,599
yeah we can just be in denial and

1096
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,839
pretend it's not happening and then you

1097
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,599
step in and then something happens

1098
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,119
and then we're in trouble but they're

1099
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,200
hitting this on all sides and that's how

1100
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,560
they do it so guess what

1101
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,359
this is one of the tools to bring in

1102
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,599
get the mineral salts inside the brain

1103
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,920
get the vitamin c that comes from this

1104
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,240
right here you know get the chemical

1105
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,079
compounds that restore

1106
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,680
everything get the sodium cluster salts

1107
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,920
that restore your stomach lands get the

1108
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,920
liver flushed out you get that toxic

1109
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
stuff flushed out man anything's

1110
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,079
possible

1111
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,720
anything's possible and most importantly

1112
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,960
you kill off pathogens

1113
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,560
i've been talking about viruses for 35

1114
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,079
plus years actually even when i was

1115
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,720
younger right

1116
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,200
okay tempo viruses still was blue in the

1117
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,640
face a ton of viruses talk about viruses

1118
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,640
talk about viruses right

1119
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,520
and what are we talking about today now

1120
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,640
we're starting to talk about viruses

1121
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,800
this right here paul i love you too man

1122
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,200
this right here

1123
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,200
is a big deal

1124
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,880
people in the next five years are going

1125
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,079
to need those medical medium tools it's
