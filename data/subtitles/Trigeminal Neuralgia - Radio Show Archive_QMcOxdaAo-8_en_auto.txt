[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.36] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 20.16] medium hello I'm Anthony William you're
[18.36 - 22.12] listening to the medical medium radio
[20.16 - 24.24] show where each week I talk about the
[22.12 - 26.04] most advanced healing information and
[24.24 - 28.72] secrets about health much of which is
[26.04 - 30.80] not found anywhere else and is decades
[28.72 - 34.00] ahead of what's out there now now what
[30.80 - 36.80] we're talking about today is more than
[34.00 - 38.24] decades ahead of what's out there now
[36.80 - 41.84] and it's unfortunate because we're
[38.24 - 44.32] talking about trigeminal neuralgia and
[41.84 - 46.40] here we are in this day and age in what
[44.32 - 48.64] year we're in with the technology we
[46.40 - 50.88] have and the so-called science to the
[48.64 - 52.48] degree we have and I'm not mocking
[50.88 - 54.76] science to the point where hey we don't
[52.48 - 56.04] have the best technology for for you
[54.76 - 57.24] know computers and everything else and
[56.04 - 58.40] everything else that meaning it could
[57.24 - 60.04] get better I'm sure and better and
[58.40 - 62.32] better each year as the years go on of
[60.04 - 64.76] course and but I'm trying to say
[62.32 - 66.92] something about chronic illness it's
[64.76 - 69.68] disastrous absolutely disastrous
[66.92 - 72.28] trigeminal neuralgia is a prime example
[69.68 - 74.68] of how we're helpless in chronic illness
[72.28 - 76.28] without the right answers and and as far
[74.68 - 78.60] as science and research goes forget it
[76.28 - 82.60] with trigeminal neuralgia it's just you
[78.60 - 85.92] know just offering a drug um and boom
[82.60 - 87.56] that's about it maybe two drugs uh maybe
[85.92 - 90.76] some sleeping pills for people who are
[87.56 - 92.60] suffering from it that's it no answers
[90.76 - 94.52] to what it is what causes it what's
[92.60 - 96.44] going on there there is there is some
[94.52 - 98.08] information going around now that's just
[96.44 - 99.64] seeping in the medical communities
[98.08 - 101.64] because of my information in medical
[99.64 - 103.72] medium book one about trigeminal
[101.64 - 105.44] neuralgia and so we're going to explore
[103.72 - 108.00] that today so we've been able to help
[105.44 - 109.68] spirit and eye and it's been a it's been
[108.00 - 111.44] a big deal when you think about it we've
[109.68 - 112.96] been able to crack the case of course
[111.44 - 114.60] because you know I've always had answers
[112.96 - 117.68] for people suffering with trinal
[114.60 - 119.48] neuralgia I always have and so it's time
[117.68 - 121.16] the whole world knows because there's
[119.48 - 123.68] that many people suffering it's that
[121.16 - 126.40] devastating it could be mild versions to
[123.68 - 128.40] to really serious versions it's it's
[126.40 - 130.00] unbelievable unbelievable what people go
[128.40 - 131.48] through if you got it if you're dealing
[130.00 - 134.24] with trinal neuralgia you know what I'm
[131.48 - 136.04] talking about and we're not going to
[134.24 - 137.08] take it lightly okay we're not going to
[136.04 - 139.96] I'm going to try to keep a sense of
[137.08 - 143.96] humor the best I can today but I get I
[139.96 - 145.84] get upset when I know where science and
[143.96 - 148.32] research is with chronic illness in
[145.84 - 149.96] certain areas and so I have tolerance
[148.32 - 151.68] for certain areas that it's that that
[149.96 - 152.72] they're just they're backwards in or
[151.68 - 154.64] they're going the wrong direction
[152.72 - 156.64] there's tolerance you know blaming
[154.64 - 158.56] everything now on genes when that's
[156.64 - 160.44] actually not the not the problem with
[158.56 - 162.60] with autoimmune disease you know things
[160.44 - 166.00] like that I I have tolerance for that to
[162.60 - 167.52] some degree but when mostly women who
[166.00 - 171.00] are suffering with trigeminal neuralgia
[167.52 - 174.16] plenty of men too it's it's it's like a
[171.00 - 176.92] torture a torture you just no one
[174.16 - 180.36] understands no one gets it unless
[176.92 - 183.56] they've had it unless they've had it no
[180.36 - 186.56] one understands the torture that
[183.56 - 188.16] trigeminal neuralia puts people into and
[186.56 - 189.44] what's torturous about it a couple a
[188.16 - 190.88] couple of things not only the pain and
[189.44 - 193.48] the agony we're going to discuss all the
[190.88 - 194.96] symptoms about it too not only all that
[193.48 - 197.08] but also not knowing what it is what's
[194.96 - 199.64] causing it just guessing games out there
[197.08 - 200.96] and no real answers no remedies and and
[199.64 - 203.44] that's what makes it really difficult we
[200.96 - 205.52] got remedies we got answers we got them
[203.44 - 207.48] here at this show and there's a reason
[205.52 - 210.56] why we got him in this show because this
[207.48 - 212.12] is the only show the only show where the
[210.56 - 214.24] information here isn't repackaged or
[212.12 - 215.80] recycled Theory that's been going around
[214.24 - 217.80] out there among the medical communities
[215.80 - 220.92] both alternative and conventional
[217.80 - 222.80] recycled repackaged garbage over and
[220.92 - 224.80] over and over again scrambled like
[222.80 - 227.72] scrambled eggs on the internet and in
[224.80 - 229.24] books it's ridiculous it really is this
[227.72 - 231.16] is the only Health show where the
[229.24 - 232.56] information is not tampered with it
[231.16 - 234.16] doesn't come from interest groups
[232.56 - 236.24] medical funding with strings attached
[234.16 - 238.12] botch research lobbyists medical
[236.24 - 239.32] lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded
[238.12 - 241.68] belief systems private panel of
[239.32 - 244.44] influence ERS health field health field
[241.68 - 246.00] payoffs and or trendy traps I'm going to
[244.44 - 248.00] say that in front of every show because
[246.00 - 251.44] first of all you need to know this
[248.00 - 253.52] information is clean it is clean it's
[251.44 - 256.40] how you can heal when you know it's
[253.52 - 258.16] clean it's important to understand that
[256.40 - 260.48] it's important to know thumb hasn't been
[258.16 - 262.76] on the scale of any of this information
[260.48 - 265.80] to persuade it if you knew how much
[262.76 - 267.48] money is invested it's investors and did
[265.80 - 270.84] you ever make an investment into
[267.48 - 272.84] anything at all did you invest into
[270.84 - 276.52] anything I mean the simplest thing did
[272.84 - 280.00] you ever invest into a used car did you
[276.52 - 282.32] ever invest into something at all when
[280.00 - 285.20] you invest in something you buy a used
[282.32 - 287.60] car okay you're in you're you're you're
[285.20 - 290.24] invested you paid money for that you
[287.60 - 294.00] paid $5,000 or whatever it is for that
[290.24 - 295.60] used car and it matters to you what the
[294.00 - 297.20] outcome of that car is going to be
[295.60 - 299.28] through its duration how it's how you're
[297.20 - 301.16] driving it and everything else it
[299.28 - 302.72] matters matters and what happens in the
[301.16 - 304.96] medical field and alternative arts and
[302.72 - 307.88] heal in in the conventional Arts there's
[304.96 - 310.64] Investments going into into Endeavors
[307.88 - 313.00] medical Endeavors and it has to come out
[310.64 - 315.96] a certain way or they will never invest
[313.00 - 318.24] again in that area or the lab
[315.96 - 320.92] technicians or the doctors will never
[318.24 - 323.20] receive a penny again for all their
[320.92 - 326.04] life's work if something doesn't come
[323.20 - 327.52] out even partially in somebody's favor
[326.04 - 328.48] this is how it's done in alternative and
[327.52 - 330.72] conventional
[328.48 - 332.92] medicine and this is why the information
[330.72 - 334.48] is skewed wrong backwards going in a
[332.92 - 336.08] backwards Direction in every way
[334.48 - 338.68] possible and guess who suffers people
[336.08 - 340.56] with trigeminal neuralgia and guess who
[338.68 - 342.32] else was suffers people with hashimotos
[340.56 - 343.36] thyroiditis wrote a book about that plus
[342.32 - 345.72] a whole bunch of other things if you
[343.36 - 347.32] haven't gotten a thyroid book yet I I
[345.72 - 349.20] don't know what to say just please
[347.32 - 351.24] please please get it because it's not
[349.20 - 353.12] just the thyroid there's over a hundred
[351.24 - 356.08] symptoms and conditions I explain what
[353.12 - 357.72] causes them and I go into more than
[356.08 - 359.60] anybody knows about the thyroid and
[357.72 - 362.28] everything else information is never
[359.60 - 364.12] ever even been heard before out there so
[362.28 - 365.72] it's important um and I don't even talk
[364.12 - 368.56] about half of what's in there a fraction
[365.72 - 371.04] of what's in there on the radio so
[368.56 - 373.52] that's something to think about so you
[371.04 - 375.24] have to understand one thing in order to
[373.52 - 377.60] have answers for something like trinal
[375.24 - 380.08] neuralgia it can't be contaminated it
[377.60 - 381.40] can't be contaminated by all the groups
[380.08 - 383.60] I just mentioned that run alternative
[381.40 - 385.52] and conventional medicine and the
[383.60 - 387.72] citations and the studies from all that
[385.52 - 390.52] alternative and conventional medicine is
[387.72 - 392.80] all contaminated it's skewed and
[390.52 - 394.52] contaminate I'm sorry to say it it just
[392.80 - 396.44] is I have to be straightforward about
[394.52 - 398.52] this of I'm not you're not going to know
[396.44 - 399.92] where to go and you be swimming around
[398.52 - 401.92] in the merry around something I wrote
[399.92 - 404.36] about musical chairs in the merry ground
[401.92 - 406.20] in the health field and that is not fun
[404.36 - 408.76] at all all the information here comes
[406.20 - 410.36] from a pure untampered Advanced Clean
[408.76 - 411.92] Source a higher source I was given the
[410.36 - 414.08] gift for and you know some people don't
[411.92 - 417.00] like the fact I was given a gift at the
[414.08 - 419.88] beginning when I was a child I I I hated
[417.00 - 422.44] the gift because because it wasn't for
[419.88 - 425.08] me it wasn't for me cuz every time I'd
[422.44 - 426.72] be like wow I got a gift I'm you know
[425.08 - 428.80] and spirit be like it's not this gift
[426.72 - 430.12] isn't for you this gift is for everybody
[428.80 - 432.60] else this gift is for people who have
[430.12 - 433.68] trinal neuralgia this gift is for people
[432.60 - 435.16] who are dealing with all kinds of
[433.68 - 436.36] autoimmune diseases this people that are
[435.16 - 437.68] dealing with all kinds of mystery
[436.36 - 439.64] symptoms and conditions which is every
[437.68 - 441.48] autoimmune disease as far as Medical
[439.64 - 443.16] Science understands it's all mystery I
[441.48 - 445.04] don't care if they name it I don't care
[443.16 - 446.96] what they say about it it's a mystery to
[445.04 - 448.40] them 100% they make you think it's not a
[446.96 - 450.96] mystery so you feel things are under
[448.40 - 455.20] control but that's not how works it's a
[450.96 - 458.68] demented system I'm sorry but it is and
[455.20 - 460.76] it's really sad and I was given the gift
[458.68 - 462.84] and when when I was a child and you know
[460.76 - 464.84] as I was growing up you know I couldn't
[462.84 - 466.48] say oh great I got this gift it's is so
[464.84 - 469.28] great spirit said no it's for everybody
[466.48 - 472.88] else the gift is for everybody else but
[469.28 - 475.04] it makes it makes people in the in the
[472.88 - 476.68] places certain places in the world that
[475.04 - 478.16] believe in certain belief systems in the
[476.68 - 479.96] medical Arena whether it's science
[478.16 - 483.28] research whether it's alter medicine
[479.96 - 485.32] whatever it is it makes them angry it
[483.28 - 487.60] makes them really angry to know I got an
[485.32 - 490.72] in on something no one else
[487.60 - 493.52] has so they they just you know they lash
[490.72 - 495.28] they lash out they lash out been dealing
[493.52 - 497.36] it with my whole life especially now
[495.28 - 498.92] because especially now at this day and
[497.36 - 500.64] age now because there's so many people
[498.92 - 502.48] healing there's so many thousands of
[500.64 - 504.32] healing people healing not just the
[502.48 - 507.88] thousands I've healed in personal
[504.32 - 510.32] oneon-one for 30 years plus okay worked
[507.88 - 512.72] on more people worked on more people
[510.32 - 514.40] youever go to the doctor's office and
[512.72 - 517.68] there'd be like a crowd of people in the
[514.40 - 518.76] waiting room okay I did that from 6:00
[517.68 - 521.28] in the
[518.76 - 522.52] morning and you know if I was lucky 700
[521.28 - 525.48] in the morning it would start but it did
[522.52 - 527.28] at 6:00 in the morning till midnight
[525.48 - 530.40] with that crowd in the in those rooms
[527.28 - 533.32] seven days a week I went three four five
[530.40 - 536.44] six years without even Christmas off or
[533.32 - 539.36] a half a day off not even Christmas Eve
[536.44 - 541.68] off and that's what I did for years and
[539.36 - 544.28] years and years and years I've helped
[541.68 - 546.60] more people and anybody has who's had
[544.28 - 548.80] the length of career that I've had and
[546.60 - 550.48] I'm saying this so you know where I come
[548.80 - 552.76] from and where I'm coming from in half
[550.48 - 555.28] those years I did it for nothing until I
[552.76 - 557.76] almost died from it because I couldn't
[555.28 - 560.84] even buy food and I couldn't even pay my
[557.76 - 562.12] rent and I couldn't even keep a car even
[560.84 - 565.00] though I couldn't drive I always had
[562.12 - 567.84] somebody drive for me because you know
[565.00 - 569.64] I'd be doing readings on the highway be
[567.84 - 572.04] getting readings all the time and I got
[569.64 - 573.68] to be careful because if I'm if you know
[572.04 - 575.08] if I'm driving and stuff I'm at a stop
[573.68 - 576.20] light I'll get readings from somebody on
[575.08 - 578.36] the right side of me readings from
[576.20 - 579.48] somebody on the left side of me spirit
[578.36 - 581.64] will be telling me what's wrong with
[579.48 - 584.08] anybody and in the old days I'd be
[581.64 - 586.20] tempted to wave them down and say hey
[584.08 - 588.04] look did you ever get this checked out I
[586.20 - 589.32] don't do that anymore you can't do that
[588.04 - 594.00] anymore you could do that in the old
[589.32 - 596.64] days you couldn't do it now so the deal
[594.00 - 598.04] is sorry about the long-winded beginning
[596.64 - 599.36] we're going to get the trial neuralia
[598.04 - 602.52] trust me and we're going to really cook
[599.36 - 606.16] into it I I promise we're going
[602.52 - 607.72] to but the point is is that yeah is is
[606.16 - 609.60] when you're given a gift and you guys
[607.72 - 611.28] got gifts I'm sure you do and I'm sure
[609.60 - 613.44] somebody's been jealous about your gift
[611.28 - 615.68] too because everybody has a gift of
[613.44 - 617.68] their own but when it comes down to
[615.68 - 619.72] chronic illness and science and research
[617.68 - 621.08] is lack of understanding of it and
[619.72 - 622.92] doctors that actually spend all this
[621.08 - 624.32] money and they go to school and I love
[622.92 - 625.36] all doctors but they go to school they
[624.32 - 627.92] spend all this money and they're not
[625.36 - 630.00] given what they need for medical school
[627.92 - 632.20] both alternative and Convention
[630.00 - 634.60] we're in a bad place we're in a bad
[632.20 - 636.44] place and tri neurologist sufferers it's
[634.60 - 639.32] a prime example I'm saying this because
[636.44 - 642.08] if you only knew if you're someone who
[639.32 - 645.20] hasn't dealt with it if you only knew
[642.08 - 647.04] what it's like you could not imagine why
[645.20 - 649.32] something's not being done about it in
[647.04 - 651.08] the field of medicine you could only you
[649.32 - 653.60] could just you can't even
[651.08 - 655.72] imagine so when someone can't sleep for
[653.60 - 657.68] 4 days in a row and they got to be
[655.72 - 659.32] drugged to go to sleep because they have
[657.68 - 660.96] pain on the side of their face on the
[659.32 - 662.76] side of their head they got burning on
[660.96 - 665.48] their tongue and burning on their mouth
[662.76 - 667.68] they got they got shooting stabbing
[665.48 - 670.88] knives going into their
[667.68 - 673.20] ears and they can't sleep for 3 4 days
[670.88 - 677.00] and they're they literally have to be
[673.20 - 680.08] drugged if you only knew what that was
[677.00 - 683.36] like and I hope you never do and then o
[680.08 - 687.64] only and then you'd say why on God's
[683.36 - 689.92] Earth on God's green earth why the heck
[687.64 - 691.52] is something not being done about this
[689.92 - 693.68] plus a whole bunch of other diseases and
[691.52 - 697.28] illnesses and symptoms and mysterious
[693.68 - 699.36] conditions how come and I say to Spirit
[697.28 - 701.84] still every day I say to Spirit why am I
[699.36 - 702.96] half why am I the one that has to
[701.84 - 707.16] deliver
[702.96 - 709.52] this why am I the one that has to do
[707.16 - 711.68] this and like I said I've helped people
[709.52 - 713.32] for decades and did it for free for
[711.68 - 715.68] decades and decades and then I had to
[713.32 - 717.40] eventually charge to some degree and
[715.68 - 719.52] then I had to get some donations through
[717.40 - 723.24] the years when you know and just to stay
[719.52 - 725.68] alive to help people 3:00 in the morning
[723.24 - 729.40] mommies would be bringing their babies
[725.68 - 732.32] knocking on the door for answers I'd
[729.40 - 734.72] never even slept for years and years and
[732.32 - 737.68] been through hell and helped a lot of
[734.72 - 739.40] people and doing it and now I just got
[737.68 - 740.40] to help in different ways I got to do it
[739.40 - 741.32] through the books and I got to do it
[740.40 - 742.44] through this way and do it through the
[741.32 - 743.80] show that's what we're doing we're going
[742.44 - 746.24] to talk about trinal neuralgia we're
[743.80 - 747.32] only a few minutes in so bear with me
[746.24 - 749.64] it's just that some of these things you
[747.32 - 751.44] know I woke up this morning and I said
[749.64 - 753.04] people need to know they just need to
[751.44 - 754.88] know what what someone goes through with
[753.04 - 758.56] trial neuralgia and they need to know
[754.88 - 760.16] how how fault faulty and how faulted and
[758.56 - 761.56] how demented the system is both
[760.16 - 764.08] alternative and conventional they need
[761.56 - 765.32] to know that someone said to me hey
[764.08 - 766.56] you're just all about attacking
[765.32 - 768.68] conventional
[766.56 - 770.92] medicine and and it was like it's not
[768.68 - 773.80] about attacking anything I mean if you
[770.92 - 776.40] don't stand up for what's wrong
[773.80 - 778.00] sometimes and it's both alternative and
[776.40 - 779.64] conventional I said to this person no
[778.00 - 782.56] it's alternative
[779.64 - 784.48] too it's alternative to if you don't
[782.56 - 785.92] stand up to try to correct what's going
[784.48 - 787.92] wrong then how are you going to help the
[785.92 - 789.76] children of the children to come of the
[787.92 - 791.68] children to come of the children to come
[789.76 - 794.60] how are you going to help how are you
[791.68 - 797.68] going to do it if you don't stand up if
[794.60 - 799.88] you don't do something about it so hey
[797.68 - 804.52] look let's go into uh let's go into the
[799.88 - 806.12] trinal neuralgia let's go into that so
[804.52 - 807.60] what does it feel like to begin with I
[806.12 - 809.84] explained a little bit about it some
[807.60 - 811.80] people can have just a tingling
[809.84 - 814.04] sensation constantly on one side of the
[811.80 - 817.32] face Maybe back of the head on the other
[814.04 - 818.56] side of the face and just keeping mind a
[817.32 - 820.96] lot of these symptoms I'm going to tell
[818.56 - 822.76] you aren't even diagnosed as as trial
[820.96 - 825.04] neuralgia they're not even diagnosed
[822.76 - 827.24] that way like a doctor would even know
[825.04 - 831.44] that's even what that is they'll be
[827.24 - 833.36] looking for something else so um so and
[831.44 - 835.16] you and not to mention what people go
[833.36 - 836.84] through just trying to get a diagnosis
[835.16 - 838.84] or they go through they get MRIs they
[836.84 - 841.36] get CAT scans they get they're seeing
[838.84 - 845.12] you know 10 neurologists they seeing
[841.36 - 847.44] Specialists it is no picnic man it is no
[845.12 - 850.08] picnic it's brutal it's brutal I'm I'm
[847.44 - 851.76] just letting you know and so you can
[850.08 - 853.44] have these tingle Sensations on the side
[851.76 - 856.72] of the head you can have a weakness on
[853.44 - 859.00] the side of the head a weakness where
[856.72 - 860.56] you're like weak on one side of the head
[859.00 - 862.60] some doctors be like oh that's that's
[860.56 - 865.08] multiple sclerosis I mean just it's just
[862.60 - 867.24] a crapfest out there it's like the wild
[865.08 - 869.84] west still with no understanding about
[867.24 - 872.24] what's going on and what causes anything
[869.84 - 875.84] oh man it just gets me going it gets me
[872.24 - 877.92] going so so you can have a few different
[875.84 - 879.36] things going on when you have the
[877.92 - 880.64] sensations you could have a burning on
[879.36 - 882.20] the side of the face you could have a
[880.64 - 884.16] burning in the jaw you could have a
[882.20 - 885.68] burning on all your gums these are all
[884.16 - 887.44] different sometimes people have more
[885.68 - 888.68] than one symptom but there's all
[887.44 - 891.24] different varieties you get the burning
[888.68 - 893.68] in the in all in the gums all in the
[891.24 - 896.92] gums you could burning on one side of
[893.68 - 898.36] the gums okay one side you could have a
[896.92 - 899.68] burning on the upper side you could have
[898.36 - 901.36] a burning burning at the bottom side of
[899.68 - 902.60] the gums you could have a burning all
[901.36 - 905.88] through your mouth you could have the
[902.60 - 911.00] burning on your tongue
[905.88 - 913.40] only and you can have all that plus pain
[911.00 - 915.04] you can have all that no pain you can
[913.40 - 916.52] have just the weakness on one side of
[915.04 - 919.52] the head you can have the tingles on one
[916.52 - 923.32] side of the head you can have
[919.52 - 925.20] devastating pain in the ear okay and the
[923.32 - 927.36] okay and you can also have and some of
[925.20 - 929.32] you might have this pains in the corners
[927.36 - 930.88] at the bottom of the ears
[929.32 - 933.64] so right at the bottom of the ears I got
[930.88 - 935.68] my fingers not in my ears but I get the
[933.64 - 937.32] fingers underneath my ears you know in
[935.68 - 939.00] the neck and those little delicate
[937.32 - 940.56] Corners there where we can push in and
[939.00 - 944.12] you feel your Jawbone the back of your
[940.56 - 946.16] Jawbone we're talking pain all shooting
[944.12 - 948.92] down in there and that's brutal I've
[946.16 - 951.88] seen people suffer for years with that
[948.92 - 955.84] kind of Agony you can also have pain on
[951.88 - 957.96] the jaw where it's just a a a sharp pain
[955.84 - 959.48] like a toothache pain a toothache pain
[957.96 - 962.08] you can also have have not toothache
[959.48 - 963.28] pains but and that okay that leads to a
[962.08 - 964.72] whole another thing I can't tell you how
[963.28 - 967.60] many people had their teeth drilled
[964.72 - 969.56] pulled with trinal analia they've had I
[967.60 - 971.96] mean dentists you know have tried to
[969.56 - 974.16] remedy these situations have drilled
[971.96 - 975.68] through teeth good teeth bad teeth
[974.16 - 977.60] looking for answers you name it have
[975.68 - 979.00] seen that too many of you probably gone
[977.60 - 981.00] through that they don't do that as much
[979.00 - 982.56] anymore a lot of the dentists are
[981.00 - 984.20] finally catching you know wind a little
[982.56 - 986.84] bit they're catching catching a little
[984.20 - 988.76] bit of knowledge where okay this didn't
[986.84 - 989.60] work I'm not going to do it to this
[988.76 - 991.96] person
[989.60 - 994.96] now you can have a sensitivity with all
[991.96 - 997.28] the teeth where hot cold and then Den is
[994.96 - 998.60] like well it's kind of like a it's that
[997.28 - 999.76] you're just a highly sensitive person
[998.60 - 1002.68] with your teeth you know maybe your
[999.76 - 1004.72] enamels weakening no the nerves it's
[1002.68 - 1007.28] trial neuralgia it's just a different
[1004.72 - 1009.96] variety and different kind a different
[1007.28 - 1012.48] variety and different kind of trigeminal
[1009.96 - 1013.88] neuralgia all right and so you can you
[1012.48 - 1016.48] know so there's so many different it
[1013.88 - 1019.52] could hit the eyes transanal neuralgia
[1016.48 - 1021.52] can take out an eye hurt the eye make it
[1019.52 - 1023.40] go you can't even open you're squinty
[1021.52 - 1026.64] you can't even look through
[1023.40 - 1028.72] it it's it's it's like that it's like
[1026.64 - 1032.64] that it's like
[1028.72 - 1034.32] that and you know I mean it go it just
[1032.64 - 1036.40] just it goes to all kinds of different
[1034.32 - 1038.76] levels all kinds of different levels
[1036.40 - 1041.00] okay but here's the bottom line you have
[1038.76 - 1044.96] to understand something with trigeminal
[1041.00 - 1049.00] neuralgia it's it moves too it moves it
[1044.96 - 1051.44] creeps it creeps that's a creeper
[1049.00 - 1053.88] okay it could start out small get worse
[1051.44 - 1056.64] worse worse worse it can start out
[1053.88 - 1057.84] really bad then go down to like a
[1056.64 - 1059.48] minimum kind of thing where you're
[1057.84 - 1062.16] living with it living with it living
[1059.48 - 1064.44] with it and then creep back up again it
[1062.16 - 1066.12] could get triggered easy too easily
[1064.44 - 1068.08] triggered with just aggravation an
[1066.12 - 1071.12] argument with somebody
[1068.08 - 1074.16] confrontation with someone can trigger
[1071.12 - 1078.20] it and make it just spiral through the
[1074.16 - 1080.00] damn roof nobody knows that nobody knows
[1078.20 - 1081.92] that they don't only the people that
[1080.00 - 1085.36] suffer nobody knows that I don't even
[1081.92 - 1087.96] think anybody even is even can register
[1085.36 - 1089.52] that one you're you're going along okay
[1087.96 - 1090.96] you got the triam neuraly you got the
[1089.52 - 1092.24] nerve pain and you got you know whether
[1090.96 - 1094.40] it's a side of the face or any of the
[1092.24 - 1095.72] symptoms I just said and you're going
[1094.40 - 1097.56] along and all of a sudden you got to
[1095.72 - 1098.64] talk to somebody that's just they're
[1097.56 - 1100.84] just
[1098.64 - 1103.00] annoying they're annoying because
[1100.84 - 1104.72] they're causing confrontation on purpose
[1103.00 - 1107.36] or they're just it's somebody maybe it's
[1104.72 - 1109.68] a family member that just has a bone to
[1107.36 - 1112.32] pick with you in that moment maybe maybe
[1109.68 - 1114.84] it's somebody at work and oh my God it
[1112.32 - 1117.28] can just it can just literally pronounce
[1114.84 - 1122.72] and bring out the worst of that Tri
[1117.28 - 1122.72] germinal neuralgia within minutes within
[1122.84 - 1129.40] minutes yeah I know I know it's
[1127.16 - 1132.52] unbelievable and and it it's hard on
[1129.40 - 1135.92] people it's hard on people I said I know
[1132.52 - 1138.76] because Spirit was um tuning into to
[1135.92 - 1141.32] somebody actually in the audience um
[1138.76 - 1143.32] actually talking that second saying how
[1141.32 - 1145.32] that's awful and how bad that is and and
[1143.32 - 1149.28] and oh my God and everything and yeah I
[1145.32 - 1152.68] know I know it's that bad um here's the
[1149.28 - 1154.36] deal it it it not only creeps and moves
[1152.68 - 1156.52] but it can get into like I said the eye
[1154.36 - 1157.96] area it can get into the head it can get
[1156.52 - 1159.36] in the side of the head it can go up to
[1157.96 - 1160.28] the top of the head it can go to the
[1159.36 - 1162.36] bottom of the head and here's the
[1160.28 - 1164.48] problem with trigeminal neur neuralgia
[1162.36 - 1167.80] it can run down the
[1164.48 - 1170.92] shoulder it can run down the neck it can
[1167.80 - 1174.96] run down the shoulder and
[1170.92 - 1177.04] neck it can even run down the chest how
[1174.96 - 1178.44] can it run down the chest because I'm
[1177.04 - 1180.32] going to tell you why because when I
[1178.44 - 1182.84] tell you what causes trigal neuralgia
[1180.32 - 1185.08] when I tell you what causes it and how
[1182.84 - 1187.12] that affects other nerves in the body
[1185.08 - 1189.12] like your Vegas nerve that's the first
[1187.12 - 1190.48] time I I mean the F first time I brought
[1189.12 - 1191.88] the whole Vegas thing to the world
[1190.48 - 1192.72] through the books through medical medium
[1191.88 - 1195.32] book
[1192.72 - 1197.76] one and um teaching people about the
[1195.32 - 1199.84] Vagas nerve and how it gets affected by
[1197.76 - 1201.28] viral issues you get where we're going
[1199.84 - 1203.44] by viral
[1201.28 - 1204.72] issues okay cuz we're going somewhere
[1203.44 - 1206.32] with that we're heading somewhere with
[1204.72 - 1209.08] the viral
[1206.32 - 1211.96] issues so the tri the trial neuralgia
[1209.08 - 1214.32] can reach the vagus nerve the frenic
[1211.96 - 1215.64] nerves frenic nerves are the nerves that
[1214.32 - 1216.88] run on each side of the chest and they
[1215.64 - 1218.64] run through your chest and they go up
[1216.88 - 1220.76] through your neck into your head the
[1218.64 - 1224.72] sides of the heads they connect sides of
[1220.76 - 1227.36] your head they connect to the trigeminal
[1224.72 - 1229.04] nerves eventually find their way with
[1227.36 - 1230.92] tiny nerve endings connecting into the
[1229.04 - 1233.04] trigeminal
[1230.92 - 1234.36] nerves and these frenic nerves run
[1233.04 - 1235.84] through the chest and they can tighten
[1234.36 - 1239.56] the chest they can cause problems in the
[1235.84 - 1242.36] chest they can cause problems in the
[1239.56 - 1244.64] shoulders they can cause problems in the
[1242.36 - 1245.76] neck and they get in next thing you know
[1244.64 - 1247.72] it you got somebody with the worst
[1245.76 - 1250.00] trigeminal neuralgia that's getting into
[1247.72 - 1251.88] other places like frenic nerve issues
[1250.00 - 1253.92] vagus nerve issues and it's getting all
[1251.88 - 1256.00] wound into all those
[1253.92 - 1259.76] areas
[1256.00 - 1261.64] right right I mean some of you I know go
[1259.76 - 1263.28] through that there's no question there's
[1261.64 - 1266.04] no doubt about
[1263.28 - 1268.24] it and what does it do it keeps you at
[1266.04 - 1270.48] home it makes it so you can't work some
[1268.24 - 1273.52] people work with it on drugs some people
[1270.48 - 1275.28] the drugs don't touch it on any level
[1273.52 - 1279.20] and they just you know they're they're
[1275.28 - 1280.44] they're just living with it every day
[1279.20 - 1283.24] with no
[1280.44 - 1285.16] answers what we got answers we got
[1283.24 - 1287.16] answers today I'm excited about this we
[1285.16 - 1289.16] got answers today so I just want to make
[1287.16 - 1291.04] sure I cover every symptom the trinal
[1289.16 - 1292.76] neuralia can cause I mean it can get the
[1291.04 - 1294.84] roof of somebody's mouth I've seen that
[1292.76 - 1296.80] before it can get the roof it can get
[1294.84 - 1299.60] the back of the tongue it can get the
[1296.80 - 1301.40] back of the mullers in the jaw the back
[1299.60 - 1302.84] of the jaw and the mullers sometimes
[1301.40 - 1304.92] then somebody will say well that's just
[1302.84 - 1306.48] you know that's just your mandal you
[1304.92 - 1308.80] know your your your mandolin joint
[1306.48 - 1310.16] that's just the mandible joint that's
[1308.80 - 1313.88] just your mandible joint and there's
[1310.16 - 1316.40] going to be like that and um um yeah
[1313.88 - 1318.52] don't get that confused with with with a
[1316.40 - 1321.08] little fruit the Mandarin orang little
[1318.52 - 1323.00] fruit I said but it's the man yeah the
[1321.08 - 1324.08] mandible joint there okay so they get
[1323.00 - 1326.32] confused with that they say well your
[1324.08 - 1328.12] joint's messed up you know you got this
[1326.32 - 1330.00] joint and they're now sizing you up you
[1328.12 - 1331.80] got the tri ginal neuralgia but they're
[1330.00 - 1333.28] sizing up with all the gear all the
[1331.80 - 1334.72] mouth gear they're trying to correct
[1333.28 - 1335.92] your jawline they're trying to correct
[1334.72 - 1337.92] everything you're trying to correct your
[1335.92 - 1339.52] bite they got all this going on I've
[1337.92 - 1341.24] seen people go through hell with all
[1339.52 - 1342.96] that and still not fix it because what
[1341.24 - 1345.56] they had was something else which was
[1342.96 - 1347.60] viral and nobody knows it's viral they
[1345.56 - 1350.08] starting to know now because I put it
[1347.60 - 1351.88] out there there if you hear it out there
[1350.08 - 1353.96] you're going to get it from thieves
[1351.88 - 1356.64] that's stealing the night what I say by
[1353.96 - 1359.12] that is it because they won't cite where
[1356.64 - 1361.40] they got it from and they got it from me
[1359.12 - 1363.76] it's important to cite where you get it
[1361.40 - 1366.12] from when you have truthful information
[1363.76 - 1367.80] like this in all the shows and all the
[1366.12 - 1369.52] books it's important to cite it some
[1367.80 - 1371.28] people do some people don't but it's
[1369.52 - 1373.28] important it's done I'll tell you why so
[1371.28 - 1375.32] the person who's getting help can get to
[1373.28 - 1376.76] the source of where all the answers are
[1375.32 - 1379.12] for these problems and not get it
[1376.76 - 1380.32] confused with a mixed bag in nuts now
[1379.12 - 1382.24] because someone's got a bunch of other
[1380.32 - 1384.80] belief systems that has no idea about
[1382.24 - 1387.16] how drinal NRA works but they're
[1384.80 - 1388.64] starting to get wind of it they're
[1387.16 - 1391.40] starting to get wind of
[1388.64 - 1393.68] it and they're starting to sense it's
[1391.40 - 1395.56] viral some doctors are being like I
[1393.68 - 1397.84] think this is
[1395.56 - 1399.16] viral and it is viral and we're going to
[1397.84 - 1401.40] cover which virus and we're going to go
[1399.16 - 1403.04] into it deep in the whole bit we're
[1401.40 - 1404.84] going to do that now so let's cover into
[1403.04 - 1406.84] that so what causes trigeminal neuralgia
[1404.84 - 1409.96] it's a virus it's from the herpetic
[1406.84 - 1412.36] family it's the only family that can
[1409.96 - 1415.60] cause trigeminal neuralgia that can
[1412.36 - 1419.44] affect a trigeminal nerve and can affect
[1415.60 - 1421.76] Vagas nerves and can in in affect frenic
[1419.44 - 1424.08] nerves and can cause the problems I'm
[1421.76 - 1426.60] talking about it's the herpetic family
[1424.08 - 1428.00] and only the herpetic family and guess
[1426.60 - 1429.88] what science and research doesn't even
[1428.00 - 1431.60] know any of that it's so important to
[1429.88 - 1432.72] know because if you're a new listener
[1431.60 - 1434.08] too you're going to be like well where's
[1432.72 - 1437.08] he getting the information the internet
[1434.08 - 1439.44] no never ever and any book I've ever
[1437.08 - 1441.72] written so far you guys any book I've
[1439.44 - 1443.28] ever written and I just finished one
[1441.72 - 1446.12] that's going to come out later this year
[1443.28 - 1448.12] any book I've ever written there's not
[1446.12 - 1450.16] one word out of that book that comes
[1448.12 - 1453.00] from an internet or another source it's
[1450.16 - 1455.48] just from Spirit alone and spirit alone
[1453.00 - 1458.40] only these medical books are written
[1455.48 - 1459.80] from hearing Spirit speak and that's
[1458.40 - 1462.00] what these these medical books are
[1459.80 - 1464.04] written how they're
[1462.00 - 1466.00] written and that's why we have anwers
[1464.04 - 1468.56] for trial neuralia let me tell you some
[1466.00 - 1471.28] of the flaws about also about the
[1468.56 - 1473.36] industry with with not understanding
[1471.28 - 1475.40] something about the herpetic family the
[1473.36 - 1478.44] herpetic viruses the herpetic viruses
[1475.40 - 1480.68] are the ones that actually flare up
[1478.44 - 1483.84] nerves they're also the ones responsible
[1480.68 - 1485.36] for lime now if you're if you're angry
[1483.84 - 1487.40] about what I just said because you're
[1485.36 - 1489.32] saying how can that be bacteria whatever
[1487.40 - 1491.68] you don't even know the history of how
[1489.32 - 1493.24] it really went from the beginning to
[1491.68 - 1494.76] where it went where they decided to call
[1493.24 - 1497.48] it bacteria the reason why they called
[1494.76 - 1499.28] it bacteria the reason why they did that
[1497.48 - 1501.72] because because it sold the treatment it
[1499.28 - 1504.16] sold the antibiotics because when it was
[1501.72 - 1505.92] diagnosed as viral back in 1973 Lyme
[1504.16 - 1509.08] disease was diagnosed as viral back in
[1505.92 - 1511.96] 1972 and 3 when a whole bunch of the
[1509.08 - 1514.80] best doctors knew it was viral 100%
[1511.96 - 1517.04] there was no treatment so then nobody
[1514.80 - 1520.12] could make any money it was called a
[1517.04 - 1521.60] dead duck a dead duck illness that's
[1520.12 - 1524.80] what it was called because there wasn't
[1521.60 - 1528.32] a penny to be made off lime disease so
[1524.80 - 1531.08] back the late 70s came early 80s someone
[1528.32 - 1533.16] had to make the bucks so they they
[1531.08 - 1534.96] called it bacterial for a reason because
[1533.16 - 1538.44] the amount of antibiotics that have been
[1534.96 - 1541.00] sold and used for Lyme disease is
[1538.44 - 1544.20] unbelievably astronomic you could not
[1541.00 - 1546.16] believe the multi multi multi
[1544.20 - 1548.36] multi-billions almost touching a
[1546.16 - 1551.88] trillion pretty soon on the antibiotic
[1548.36 - 1554.28] sales for lime it was the Cash Cow and
[1551.88 - 1556.12] it's still kept that way purposely the
[1554.28 - 1559.64] industry still keeps it that
[1556.12 - 1561.48] way okay but even lime is viral I'm
[1559.64 - 1563.52] sorry to say that if you're totally
[1561.48 - 1566.44] angry about this right now go to go to
[1563.52 - 1569.76] book one and read my lime chapter listen
[1566.44 - 1571.64] to the lime show that I also have okay
[1569.76 - 1573.64] I'm not saying bacteria aren't present
[1571.64 - 1575.32] I'm not saying there isn't any bacteria
[1573.64 - 1577.48] I'm not saying any of that I'm just
[1575.32 - 1580.28] saying it's the herpetic family that
[1577.48 - 1581.96] causes neurological problems please
[1580.28 - 1584.36] understand that if you want any help and
[1581.96 - 1586.16] you want to help your family and if you
[1584.36 - 1588.40] knew how many people were wasted with
[1586.16 - 1591.00] Lyme disease over the last 30 5 years
[1588.40 - 1592.80] their lives ruined wasted or killed off
[1591.00 - 1594.84] themselves because of antibiotics and
[1592.80 - 1596.88] the unknowing of the fact that it was
[1594.84 - 1598.60] viral you wouldn't believe the disaster
[1596.88 - 1600.44] and the wake and the hell that people
[1598.60 - 1602.84] went through and the families that were
[1600.44 - 1606.12] literally ruined dissembled just
[1602.84 - 1608.00] destroyed over not understanding lime
[1606.12 - 1610.92] was viral instead believing it was
[1608.00 - 1613.28] bacterial greatest disaster in human
[1610.92 - 1614.84] history and chronic medicine is that
[1613.28 - 1616.72] alone but guess what the people that
[1614.84 - 1619.24] came to me over the last 35 years all
[1616.72 - 1621.04] got better with lme because it was viral
[1619.24 - 1622.28] and spirit knew what to do and they live
[1621.04 - 1624.16] their lives and they're happy and
[1622.28 - 1625.72] they're still healthy now and that's the
[1624.16 - 1627.36] difference and that's why with trial
[1625.72 - 1628.48] neuralgia we have to think the same way
[1627.36 - 1629.72] and do the same thing because when we
[1628.48 - 1631.00] know what's wrong with it we have to
[1629.72 - 1632.60] know what to do to heal and get it
[1631.00 - 1634.56] better and move it forward and that's
[1632.60 - 1637.84] the key and that's how you do it trinal
[1634.56 - 1640.00] neuralgia is herpetic family viral
[1637.84 - 1643.20] that's what it is it's the only virus
[1640.00 - 1645.32] that creates treal neuralgia the Family
[1643.20 - 1646.96] itself herpetic family it hits nerves
[1645.32 - 1648.28] like frenic and Vegas nerves I said that
[1646.96 - 1649.76] already but it's important to hear it
[1648.28 - 1651.64] again because it can go right over a lot
[1649.76 - 1654.04] of people's heads some people say you
[1651.64 - 1655.32] repeat yourself and then some people
[1654.04 - 1657.24] said well I didn't understand what you
[1655.32 - 1660.08] said I needed you to say it again I
[1657.24 - 1662.32] can't win I can't win but I try to
[1660.08 - 1663.76] repeat myself where I can't important
[1662.32 - 1666.08] places like this this is really
[1663.76 - 1667.88] important so how does it work what virus
[1666.08 - 1670.08] is it what virus in the herpetic family
[1667.88 - 1673.64] it's the shingles virus 100% the
[1670.08 - 1675.80] shingles virus now I don't have a lot of
[1673.64 - 1678.24] faith in research and Science and
[1675.80 - 1680.80] chronic illness I I'll give you an
[1678.24 - 1682.40] example research and science still says
[1680.80 - 1684.36] out there and they teach all the doctors
[1682.40 - 1685.60] this backwards wrong information they
[1684.36 - 1688.72] teach the
[1685.60 - 1691.00] doctors that the chickenpox is the
[1688.72 - 1693.12] shingles so if you had the chickenpox
[1691.00 - 1694.72] you got the shingles down the road
[1693.12 - 1697.84] they're two different
[1694.72 - 1699.28] viruses two different completely
[1697.84 - 1702.48] different
[1699.28 - 1704.92] viruses so just to think about that
[1702.48 - 1706.52] blunder that serious medical blunder all
[1704.92 - 1709.48] in its own think about that one right
[1706.52 - 1712.80] there then where are we really
[1709.48 - 1714.20] going that blunder is so big and it's
[1712.80 - 1717.40] not being
[1714.20 - 1720.76] corrected okay the chickenpox virus is
[1717.40 - 1724.04] one virus in the herpetic family it's
[1720.76 - 1726.96] one out of hundreds and hundreds the
[1724.04 - 1729.96] shingles is entirely different virus in
[1726.96 - 1733.68] the herpetic family and in the shingles
[1729.96 - 1735.56] group itself there are over 31 varieties
[1733.68 - 1737.64] that I've been able to document with
[1735.56 - 1739.84] spirit and help people heal over the
[1737.64 - 1742.44] decades and one of those shingles
[1739.84 - 1748.40] varieties one of those varieties causes
[1742.44 - 1748.40] trigeminal neuralgia it causes the
[1748.44 - 1753.08] problem and so here's how it goes you
[1751.68 - 1755.52] don't have to have a breakout of
[1753.08 - 1757.52] shingles in order to have trial
[1755.52 - 1759.72] neuralgia you could have had a breakout
[1757.52 - 1761.96] in shingles years ago didn't know little
[1759.72 - 1764.48] patch on your leg maybe a little patch
[1761.96 - 1766.64] on the arm maybe a little patch on the
[1764.48 - 1768.88] breast maybe a little patch on the neck
[1766.64 - 1770.88] maybe a little patch behind the ear
[1768.88 - 1772.84] maybe a little patch on your back you
[1770.88 - 1775.80] could had
[1772.84 - 1777.80] that but most people will try geminal
[1775.80 - 1779.68] neuralgia don't really get the shingles
[1777.80 - 1782.48] breakout some a lot of people do some
[1779.68 - 1785.88] people don't many most people
[1782.48 - 1789.56] don't but it's a shingles virus that
[1785.88 - 1791.76] actually gets to the nerves it's a non
[1789.56 - 1794.12] rashing shingles virus that tends to
[1791.76 - 1796.36] rash sometimes but I call it non-
[1794.12 - 1798.72] rashing because it's not the big rashers
[1796.36 - 1801.24] it's not the typical variety I talk
[1798.72 - 1803.32] about in medical medium book one with
[1801.24 - 1806.04] shingles itself where you get the herpes
[1803.32 - 1808.32] zou ripping across your your side
[1806.04 - 1810.56] ripping across your lower belly ripping
[1808.32 - 1813.04] across your back or your your butt
[1810.56 - 1815.36] ripping across there there different
[1813.04 - 1817.88] varieties of shingles trino neuralgia is
[1815.36 - 1819.92] a whole different variety research and
[1817.88 - 1821.68] science doesn't even know about the
[1819.92 - 1824.24] different varieties of shingles we're
[1821.68 - 1829.44] not even there yet we're so not even
[1824.24 - 1831.84] there yet 50 years 60 I'll dead gone you
[1829.44 - 1837.08] know whatever and they're still not
[1831.84 - 1841.12] going to know and maybe maybe somehow um
[1837.08 - 1844.56] you know God God willing God loving God
[1841.12 - 1846.36] knowing that the information spreads
[1844.56 - 1848.84] that we're putting out there and
[1846.36 - 1851.88] something gets done about it you know I
[1848.84 - 1854.56] hope to God but anyway the bottom line
[1851.88 - 1856.20] is with the trial neuralia VAR variety
[1854.56 - 1858.68] of virus the shingles variety that
[1856.20 - 1859.96] causes that when you know what's wrong
[1858.68 - 1863.00] and you know what it is and you know
[1859.96 - 1865.96] what kind of virus it is then you can go
[1863.00 - 1869.40] after it then you can go after it it's
[1865.96 - 1873.80] not the same virus that causes Bell's
[1869.40 - 1875.44] paly Bell's paly where the droop happens
[1873.80 - 1877.04] whether the droop in the eye the droop
[1875.44 - 1879.00] that's a shingles virus too but it's one
[1877.04 - 1880.44] of the 31 varieties it's a different
[1879.00 - 1881.48] varieties of shingles it's a different
[1880.44 - 1883.56] variety of
[1881.48 - 1884.84] shingles some people can have the bells
[1883.56 - 1886.44] paly variety and they could have
[1884.84 - 1888.20] trigeminal neuralia variety you can have
[1886.44 - 1890.36] two some people people have the the
[1888.20 - 1891.92] straight herpes Zer variety where that
[1890.36 - 1893.76] just rips across their back and their
[1891.92 - 1895.88] stomach and then they get trigeminal Nur
[1893.76 - 1897.44] neuralgia also which is a different
[1895.88 - 1899.72] variety because we can have multiple
[1897.44 - 1902.88] varieties of shingles in our body we get
[1899.72 - 1906.36] a multiple we can catch a variety of
[1902.88 - 1908.48] shingles we can catch a variety of
[1906.36 - 1910.28] shingles you know I was just I was
[1908.48 - 1911.56] talking about how you know I'm always
[1910.28 - 1914.40] I'm always yeah I'm paranoid about
[1911.56 - 1916.16] catching things so be only because
[1914.40 - 1918.56] Spirit has tortured me by telling me
[1916.16 - 1921.04] about the tuberculosis on a plane seat
[1918.56 - 1923.76] or the Mera on a plane seat or you know
[1921.04 - 1926.16] whatever so I've always always I've
[1923.76 - 1928.12] always been you know because it's there
[1926.16 - 1930.52] and spirit knows it's there so I've
[1928.12 - 1932.68] gotten really weird about stuff so when
[1930.52 - 1934.96] I grab door handles in public places I
[1932.68 - 1937.40] take my pinky and I go underneath and I
[1934.96 - 1940.24] grab it I know I talked about that
[1937.40 - 1942.56] before but because yeah I don't want a
[1940.24 - 1947.20] variety of Jingles that I don't
[1942.56 - 1949.52] need right now I don't because I'm my
[1947.20 - 1952.00] forget touch something in a certain way
[1949.52 - 1953.76] and stick it in my eye rub my eye cuz
[1952.00 - 1956.04] I'm tired all the time because I stay up
[1953.76 - 1957.36] late writing the books with Spirit
[1956.04 - 1959.72] sometimes when spirit's on a roll we
[1957.36 - 1961.80] don't stop I don't care if that takes 30
[1959.72 - 1964.04] hours straight of information coming
[1961.80 - 1966.92] from Spirit I got to write down and
[1964.04 - 1969.48] write down word for word with a pen and
[1966.92 - 1972.32] a pencil here's the
[1969.48 - 1973.80] deal so let's work on getting it better
[1972.32 - 1975.00] and figure out how to get it better for
[1973.80 - 1977.12] everybody everybody's going to have a
[1975.00 - 1978.56] different situation some shingles
[1977.12 - 1981.12] viruses are going to be rooted in pretty
[1978.56 - 1982.20] deep they're there a long time some
[1981.12 - 1985.04] people have been through a lot of
[1982.20 - 1986.32] standard Medical Treatments you know
[1985.04 - 1987.72] been through the steroids been through
[1986.32 - 1989.32] the different drugs and everything else
[1987.72 - 1991.96] and they've gone through a lot so that
[1989.32 - 1993.92] doesn't help the situation um that fills
[1991.96 - 1996.56] the liver with a lot of medication so
[1993.92 - 1998.60] and the shingles is M the shingles its
[1996.56 - 2000.16] main home is the liver to start with so
[1998.60 - 2001.52] it camps out there that's where it
[2000.16 - 2003.36] starts that's where it grows that's
[2001.52 - 2004.84] where it does its thing then it launches
[2003.36 - 2007.76] off and gets to different areas of the
[2004.84 - 2009.24] body and so some people have a track
[2007.76 - 2011.00] record of a lot of medications they have
[2009.24 - 2012.40] a track record of immune system not
[2011.00 - 2013.60] doing good because of it all they got a
[2012.40 - 2015.04] track record of a lot of other
[2013.60 - 2016.52] situations involved so it takes a little
[2015.04 - 2020.28] time to
[2016.52 - 2023.20] heal some people it heals fast just a
[2020.28 - 2026.20] few weeks some people it takes a couple
[2023.20 - 2028.44] of years of being strong and diligent on
[2026.20 - 2031.96] what you need to do and you can't lose
[2028.44 - 2035.68] sight of what it is you lose sight of
[2031.96 - 2038.56] what it is then you don't get better
[2035.68 - 2040.60] because you got to know what it is I say
[2038.56 - 2042.96] it every time I'm going to say it again
[2040.60 - 2046.08] half the battle is knowing what's wrong
[2042.96 - 2050.68] the other half is doing what's
[2046.08 - 2052.16] right for it that's how you heal that is
[2050.68 - 2055.80] how you
[2052.16 - 2058.48] heal and so you just have to know that
[2055.80 - 2060.56] it's so important and so what's the
[2058.48 - 2062.44] first half it's knowing what is it's a
[2060.56 - 2063.96] virus it's the hepatic virus it's in the
[2062.44 - 2066.64] shingles family it's one of the
[2063.96 - 2068.12] varieties of shingles out of the 31 that
[2066.64 - 2069.60] caused the flare up can I tell you what
[2068.12 - 2070.96] happens when you know the truth can I
[2069.60 - 2073.00] tell you what happens your immune system
[2070.96 - 2075.00] gets aligned because when there's
[2073.00 - 2077.20] confusion in your brain and doubt and
[2075.00 - 2078.72] confusion and and and mystery in your
[2077.20 - 2080.36] brain and you've been through hell and
[2078.72 - 2082.40] you've gone to 10 neurologists and
[2080.36 - 2083.88] nobody knows what's going on with you
[2082.40 - 2085.56] guess what your immune system doesn't
[2083.88 - 2087.08] line up to what's really happening so
[2085.56 - 2088.52] it's hard to figure out how to fix it
[2087.08 - 2090.00] and you get into a jam and then you get
[2088.52 - 2093.52] stuck that's how it
[2090.00 - 2095.28] works but when you know you know I hope
[2093.52 - 2097.80] you got all that I hope you guys got all
[2095.28 - 2099.60] that when you know what what's causing
[2097.80 - 2101.08] it your immune system kicks up a notch
[2099.60 - 2103.32] because guess what messages get to your
[2101.08 - 2104.92] immune system they get to your immune
[2103.32 - 2107.40] system that you're in it now you're in
[2104.92 - 2110.12] it you're in it to win it you actually
[2107.40 - 2111.92] know the culprit you know the Invader
[2110.12 - 2113.16] it's not autoimmune it's not your body
[2111.92 - 2114.68] attacking itself that's what they're
[2113.16 - 2117.04] going to say about trinal neuralgia
[2114.68 - 2119.52] pretty soon they probably already do
[2117.04 - 2121.00] they probably already do they already
[2119.52 - 2123.68] say you know
[2121.00 - 2124.92] it's it's the body attacking itself cuz
[2123.68 - 2127.12] that's all they got that's all they got
[2124.92 - 2128.00] in their bag we're this far along that's
[2127.12 - 2130.56] all they
[2128.00 - 2133.76] got you know and and and you know and I
[2130.56 - 2136.04] believe it's on purpose just call me
[2133.76 - 2137.84] call me a little you know funny about
[2136.04 - 2139.96] that but I believe it's on purpose
[2137.84 - 2141.76] because come on how can we be here this
[2139.96 - 2143.36] day and age and have no answers for
[2141.76 - 2144.60] autoimmune disease all in of the
[2143.36 - 2147.72] hundreds and hundreds of autoimmune
[2144.60 - 2150.20] diseases we got no answers for any of it
[2147.72 - 2152.60] so you know so here here's the
[2150.20 - 2153.88] deal here's the deal so let's let's get
[2152.60 - 2155.24] into this and figure this out we're
[2153.88 - 2156.84] going to go after the virus once your
[2155.24 - 2158.28] mind knows you're going after the virus
[2156.84 - 2159.76] that's one big piece of it then we're
[2158.28 - 2161.16] going to go after it we're going to use
[2159.76 - 2162.36] things to go after it we're going to get
[2161.16 - 2164.04] you on the right things you can go to
[2162.36 - 2164.96] your practitioner and say here here's
[2164.04 - 2167.96] what I
[2164.96 - 2169.40] heard here's what I heard I can take
[2167.96 - 2170.72] this or do this and this and this is a
[2169.40 - 2172.64] shingles virus and your practitioner
[2170.72 - 2175.92] you'll find a practitioner that'll be on
[2172.64 - 2177.36] board on board listen if you have a
[2175.92 - 2178.64] doctor and you really like that doctor
[2177.36 - 2179.76] and that doctor is a great doctor but
[2178.64 - 2181.56] your doctor doesn't want to know
[2179.76 - 2184.16] anything to do with this this shingles
[2181.56 - 2186.44] virus and trigeminal neuralgia keep your
[2184.16 - 2188.04] doctor keep on going because you know
[2186.44 - 2189.56] because I'm sure he or she is really
[2188.04 - 2191.20] helpful with all kinds of things but
[2189.56 - 2193.28] make sure you go find another one too
[2191.20 - 2195.32] and get another one and have two get one
[2193.28 - 2197.48] that will understand and listen to
[2195.32 - 2199.04] you get one that will understand and
[2197.48 - 2200.68] listen to you so you can get better and
[2199.04 - 2202.64] then tell that one look this is what
[2200.68 - 2204.36] I've heard this is what I know this is
[2202.64 - 2206.32] what's going on this is what you know I
[2204.36 - 2208.04] need to do just help me with this you
[2206.32 - 2208.88] can do that if you if you don't like
[2208.04 - 2211.60] being
[2208.88 - 2213.88] alone and doing
[2211.60 - 2215.84] things so what do we need to do we need
[2213.88 - 2217.84] to kill off the virus knock its Army
[2215.84 - 2220.04] down what your feeling with all the pain
[2217.84 - 2222.60] and everything else is a neurotoxin a
[2220.04 - 2225.12] neurotoxin it's a virus the shingles
[2222.60 - 2227.32] virus eating a food it likes and then
[2225.12 - 2230.00] when it eliminates it eliminates a toxic
[2227.32 - 2231.72] poison I talk about in thyroid
[2230.00 - 2234.32] healing but I was talking about the
[2231.72 - 2238.24] Epstein bar because all herpetic viruses
[2234.32 - 2240.08] leech they they they they eliminate a
[2238.24 - 2241.56] neurotoxin and they cause different
[2240.08 - 2243.16] symptoms different neurological
[2241.56 - 2245.28] conditions each each herpetic virus
[2243.16 - 2248.12] causes different neurological conditions
[2245.28 - 2249.60] the shingles herp virus causes one of
[2248.12 - 2250.96] the varieties causes the trinal
[2249.60 - 2252.36] neuralgia you're dealing with and when
[2250.96 - 2255.20] it releases this
[2252.36 - 2258.36] neurotoxin into the bloodstream the
[2255.20 - 2259.56] neurotoxin goes to adjacent areas where
[2258.36 - 2262.16] nerves
[2259.56 - 2264.28] are and the trigeminal neuralgia
[2262.16 - 2266.32] shingles virus leaves the liver it likes
[2264.28 - 2268.12] to go up into the jaw it likes to go up
[2266.32 - 2270.24] into the dral nerves it likes to go into
[2268.12 - 2271.60] even the frenic and and and vas nerve
[2270.24 - 2273.64] sometimes up in those areas and it likes
[2271.60 - 2276.80] to get into the neck and other areas and
[2273.64 - 2280.04] it then pees and poos it pees and and
[2276.80 - 2283.72] poos when it pees and poos it's peeing
[2280.04 - 2285.40] and pooing neurotoxins those neurotoxins
[2283.72 - 2290.84] are
[2285.40 - 2290.84] extremely allergenic to a
[2290.92 - 2295.08] nerve extremely
[2293.28 - 2296.92] allergenic and then if you've had an
[2295.08 - 2298.84] injury with the jaw or an injury with
[2296.92 - 2301.40] any of those nerves or if a dentist
[2298.84 - 2303.40] jammed a needle in and it it it it it
[2301.40 - 2305.80] really poked hard it went in some
[2303.40 - 2307.60] cockeyed way right in that jaw when
[2305.80 - 2309.76] you're getting d to work then if the
[2307.60 - 2311.84] shingles virus is present in that moment
[2309.76 - 2314.28] or kicking around it will find that
[2311.84 - 2317.56] little wound and go to it and then
[2314.28 - 2318.88] settle in nest in and start working its
[2317.56 - 2321.72] way in the nerves and releasing more
[2318.88 - 2325.00] neurotoxins flaring up the
[2321.72 - 2328.40] nerves this is what the virus
[2325.00 - 2330.28] does this is what it does Spirit has
[2328.40 - 2334.00] advanced information doesn't
[2330.28 - 2337.68] Spirit yeah for sure yeah I was telling
[2334.00 - 2341.16] people this when I was a kid and people
[2337.68 - 2342.44] their heads would spin all right so
[2341.16 - 2344.64] listen here's the
[2342.44 - 2346.16] deal we're going to go after the virus
[2344.64 - 2347.28] let's talk about what we can use to go
[2346.16 - 2348.72] after the virus so you're going to be
[2347.28 - 2350.08] slowly killing off the virus it's going
[2348.72 - 2351.64] to take time some people have more
[2350.08 - 2354.00] levels of the shiggles virus than them
[2351.64 - 2356.00] causing more pain some people have less
[2354.00 - 2357.76] levels some people have been through a
[2356.00 - 2359.96] lot some people have have like I said
[2357.76 - 2363.56] they got a lot of toxins in them and the
[2359.96 - 2365.76] food they're eating is feeding the virus
[2363.56 - 2367.40] okay so eggs I talk about that all the
[2365.76 - 2369.20] time how come I don't like eggs because
[2367.40 - 2371.12] they feed the shingles virus they feed
[2369.20 - 2373.04] every single bug in the body you don't
[2371.12 - 2375.68] want in the body especially the herpetic
[2373.04 - 2377.04] family get away get away from the dairy
[2375.68 - 2379.44] course the
[2377.04 - 2381.64] gluten you know what happens with people
[2379.44 - 2383.12] and experts in the field of autoimmune
[2381.64 - 2384.40] or in the field of alternative medicine
[2383.12 - 2385.88] and the book writers and all the other
[2384.40 - 2387.56] stuff that put the books out and they
[2385.88 - 2389.48] talk about gluten and they don't
[2387.56 - 2390.96] understand that your body's not
[2389.48 - 2392.84] attacking itself because you're eating
[2390.96 - 2394.96] gluten you got a virus that's feeding
[2392.84 - 2396.60] off of gluten and then causing problems
[2394.96 - 2398.04] the virus is causing problems we're not
[2396.60 - 2399.72] even there yet with the latest
[2398.04 - 2401.32] alternative experts that are on the
[2399.72 - 2403.36] doctor shows and they're doing whatever
[2401.32 - 2406.16] they don't even have a clue that that's
[2403.36 - 2407.72] how it works to this point it's actually
[2406.16 - 2411.64] embarrassing at this
[2407.72 - 2412.96] point I just I just we're so far behind
[2411.64 - 2414.52] so what happens is when you're eating
[2412.96 - 2416.72] that gluten you're feeding the shingles
[2414.52 - 2418.68] virus and it's going to be eliminating
[2416.72 - 2420.52] more neurotoxins if you have a lot of
[2418.68 - 2421.96] heavy metals in your system if you have
[2420.52 - 2423.28] heavy metals in your jaw from dental
[2421.96 - 2425.36] work from years ago if you have all
[2423.28 - 2426.80] these things it can become food too so
[2425.36 - 2428.68] you want to be on the heavy metal detox
[2426.80 - 2433.48] smoothie so the medical medium heavy
[2428.68 - 2436.08] metal detox smoothie I don't trust any
[2433.48 - 2439.80] other heavy metal
[2436.08 - 2442.84] detoxification treatment on the planet
[2439.80 - 2445.60] except for Spirits the heavy metal detox
[2442.84 - 2446.96] smoothie I don't trust a single one of
[2445.60 - 2449.68] them first of all
[2446.96 - 2451.00] Corella which is which is supposedly
[2449.68 - 2453.96] supposed to be heral that is God for
[2451.00 - 2456.72] removing heavy metals it drops them
[2453.96 - 2459.96] nonstop it can't hold on to to heavy
[2456.72 - 2462.52] metals it if it even remotely
[2459.96 - 2466.16] removes some heavy metal it'll drop it
[2462.52 - 2469.12] in the wrongest place after it's grabbed
[2466.16 - 2470.72] it so I mean that alone other heavy
[2469.12 - 2473.76] metal treatments I don't trust any of
[2470.72 - 2476.20] them I'm sorry I only like the one I
[2473.76 - 2480.28] have because that one I trust because
[2476.20 - 2483.16] it's not a contaminated Source from some
[2480.28 - 2484.36] ridiculous belief system out there so
[2483.16 - 2486.60] make sure that you're doing the heavy
[2484.36 - 2487.96] metal detox smoothie because you want
[2486.60 - 2489.52] the heavy metals out because they feed
[2487.96 - 2491.64] the shingles virus it's one of the
[2489.52 - 2494.44] things the shingles virus likes if
[2491.64 - 2496.16] you're big on animal protein minimize it
[2494.44 - 2497.20] I would even consider and it just this
[2496.16 - 2500.52] isn't
[2497.20 - 2501.76] because I want you to be plant-based you
[2500.52 - 2504.64] know someone said oh you just want
[2501.76 - 2506.48] everybody plant-based that's not true I
[2504.64 - 2508.44] just want while you're six something to
[2506.48 - 2510.68] be done right in the right way from the
[2508.44 - 2512.00] information I have and then you go on
[2510.68 - 2513.44] your Merry way you want to eat all the
[2512.00 - 2516.84] animal protein you want later on when
[2513.44 - 2518.76] you're better go do it have fun
[2516.84 - 2520.48] and you know that's not it just I would
[2518.76 - 2521.96] with some real trienal neurologist
[2520.48 - 2524.20] sufferers I would just back off the
[2521.96 - 2526.08] animal protein altogether just just just
[2524.20 - 2529.44] just get rid of it you know it's not
[2526.08 - 2531.88] about becoming a vegan it's not about
[2529.44 - 2534.32] what it's just it's just get rid of it
[2531.88 - 2535.88] all get your trigeminal neurologia
[2534.32 - 2537.64] better get rid of all the different
[2535.88 - 2540.28] animal proteins the chicken the wood
[2537.64 - 2543.88] because what happens is is it's not that
[2540.28 - 2547.24] chicken feeds a shingles virus causing
[2543.88 - 2549.60] the trigeminal neuralgia is that chicken
[2547.24 - 2551.68] will just be a it it won't be doing it
[2549.60 - 2554.04] won't be helping to heal it so do you
[2551.68 - 2555.08] have time do you have time to waste
[2554.04 - 2557.16] you're dealing with your trigeminal
[2555.08 - 2558.56] neuralgia for years or for six months or
[2557.16 - 2559.92] for a month do you have time to waste
[2558.56 - 2561.88] you want it to last another year or two
[2559.92 - 2563.88] or three keep on eating chicken because
[2561.88 - 2567.64] it takes the space of something else
[2563.88 - 2569.24] that can actually heal your problem
[2567.64 - 2570.40] because when it comes down to all the
[2569.24 - 2572.64] different fruits and vegetables
[2570.40 - 2576.32] including potatoes especially
[2572.64 - 2578.12] potatoes that's a great one for triin on
[2576.32 - 2581.20] neuralgia potatoes it's an incredible
[2578.12 - 2585.08] one credible food it's got a hell heck
[2581.20 - 2587.16] of a lot of line content extremely high
[2585.08 - 2588.96] bioavailable line that you can't even
[2587.16 - 2591.20] get when you take line which you should
[2588.96 - 2593.68] take while you have trinal neuralgia too
[2591.20 - 2596.04] is lyine and in the potato it's got an
[2593.68 - 2598.52] answer for helping to stop the shingles
[2596.04 - 2600.80] virus so when you don't eat a potato
[2598.52 - 2602.56] because all these Trends these new
[2600.80 - 2604.56] trends are ripping apart nightshades
[2602.56 - 2606.88] again and ripping apart a
[2604.56 - 2609.56] potato when you don't eat that because
[2606.88 - 2612.24] of an an idiotic Trend that's out there
[2609.56 - 2613.72] now because say like eltin Trend or
[2612.24 - 2616.48] whatever it is you're going to keep your
[2613.72 - 2618.20] trinal neurologia around that's how it
[2616.48 - 2619.40] works that's how Trends work that's why
[2618.20 - 2620.88] they're tricky remember at the beginning
[2619.40 - 2622.40] of the show you remember at the very
[2620.88 - 2625.68] beginning when I said at the very
[2622.40 - 2628.72] beginning I said trendy traps I said or
[2625.68 - 2631.36] trendy traps trendy traps prevent
[2628.72 - 2633.00] healing they come out constantly because
[2631.36 - 2635.24] it's something that someone can hang
[2633.00 - 2637.24] their hat on the the lectin guys are
[2635.24 - 2638.72] going to hang their hat hat on the the
[2637.24 - 2640.52] fructose intolerance guys are going to
[2638.72 - 2642.08] hang their hat on someone needs to hang
[2640.52 - 2644.92] their hat on a trend it doesn't matter
[2642.08 - 2646.24] if you suffer for the rest of your life
[2644.92 - 2648.24] they'll hang that
[2646.24 - 2649.20] hat as long as it's something to hang
[2648.24 - 2653.52] their hat
[2649.20 - 2655.36] on but so forget the potato thing being
[2653.52 - 2657.08] bad it's actually important for
[2655.36 - 2658.56] trigeminal neurologist sufferers because
[2657.08 - 2661.12] it helps get rid of the shingles virus
[2658.56 - 2663.24] guess what if anybody knew if any trendy
[2661.12 - 2665.12] person knew expert out there knew what
[2663.24 - 2667.40] caused trigemino neuralgia that would
[2665.12 - 2669.72] just be the start a little inkling of
[2667.40 - 2672.16] what they would need to know but you got
[2669.72 - 2674.04] the information here I say this because
[2672.16 - 2677.36] I'm determined
[2674.04 - 2680.16] with spirit and me determined with the
[2677.36 - 2682.04] passion and the caring and the wanting
[2680.16 - 2684.44] you to heal determined for you to know
[2682.04 - 2686.96] that and I worry if you're going to get
[2684.44 - 2688.64] distracted instantly the minute you hop
[2686.96 - 2690.44] on the internet the minute you see some
[2688.64 - 2692.52] other book the minute you and then you
[2690.44 - 2694.88] get stuck with your trigeminal neuralgia
[2692.52 - 2695.80] for years back when in the old days I'm
[2694.88 - 2697.36] going to tell you right now in the old
[2695.80 - 2699.08] days and somebody came to me with trinal
[2697.36 - 2701.08] neurologia they weren't distracted they
[2699.08 - 2703.24] were able to heal and able to heal fast
[2701.08 - 2705.48] because they weren't distracted Because
[2703.24 - 2707.60] the Internet wasn't even born yet
[2705.48 - 2709.56] because because literally there weren't
[2707.60 - 2712.24] any you know there weren't any health
[2709.56 - 2713.68] books out there you couldn't get
[2712.24 - 2715.08] distracted I'm not saying everything's
[2713.68 - 2716.16] all bad and all Health books are bad I'm
[2715.08 - 2718.00] not saying that at all I'm just saying
[2716.16 - 2719.56] you couldn't get distracted from what
[2718.00 - 2722.44] you were
[2719.56 - 2724.64] doing and so it was hey this is what's
[2722.44 - 2727.28] going on here's the advanc information
[2724.64 - 2731.00] here it is the year 19 1990 whatever or
[2727.28 - 2733.24] 19 1991 here it is the year 1994 the
[2731.00 - 2734.80] 1997 here's what you need to do here's
[2733.24 - 2737.08] your protocol that's right get your
[2734.80 - 2740.04] tramal nervia better it's the shingles
[2737.08 - 2742.76] virus bam you're better done you're not
[2740.04 - 2744.76] distracted and now it's hard it's hard
[2742.76 - 2746.72] for people all they have to do is just
[2744.76 - 2749.76] turn the wrong way and someone's saying
[2746.72 - 2751.76] some some cockamamy thing and that's the
[2749.76 - 2753.48] problem so in order to heal trigeminal
[2751.76 - 2755.36] neuralgia you have to get that corrected
[2753.48 - 2757.04] too you have to stay on point and you
[2755.36 - 2759.64] have to stay diligent and you got to
[2757.04 - 2761.84] stay with it because you're going to get
[2759.64 - 2764.28] lost out there and it hurts me to know
[2761.84 - 2766.40] that because I know what it's like to
[2764.28 - 2768.76] suffer because I've been given the gift
[2766.40 - 2770.76] to actually tap into that with people
[2768.76 - 2773.04] and I know the with the compassion and
[2770.76 - 2775.00] everything else I'm not saying I'm the
[2773.04 - 2776.84] most compassionate person out there I'm
[2775.00 - 2778.88] not saying that at all it's just Spirit
[2776.84 - 2782.32] has basically placed upon me throughout
[2778.88 - 2784.28] my life a little sensitivity extra
[2782.32 - 2787.20] sensitivity inside of me to actually
[2784.28 - 2789.68] know and sense and feel somebody's
[2787.20 - 2792.12] suffering that's
[2789.68 - 2794.88] right a little bit more so than the
[2792.12 - 2796.24] average bear and I've had to Bear it and
[2794.88 - 2798.76] the whole point
[2796.24 - 2800.96] is I want you better because I know what
[2798.76 - 2802.52] you're dealing with I know what you're
[2800.96 - 2805.04] dealing with and I want you better so
[2802.52 - 2808.00] here's the deal line get the line take a
[2805.04 - 2809.92] lot of it 4,000 milligrams twice a day
[2808.00 - 2812.52] that's what I would do talk to your
[2809.92 - 2814.40] doctor talk to your doctor but I would
[2812.52 - 2816.72] do like 4,000 milligrams twice a day if
[2814.40 - 2818.00] you want to do one 500 milligrams your
[2816.72 - 2819.56] sensitive person talk to your doctor
[2818.00 - 2820.92] talk to your practitioner talk to the
[2819.56 - 2822.32] person that helps you talk to your
[2820.92 - 2824.88] health coach talk to the person that
[2822.32 - 2827.64] helps you and start out with 500
[2824.88 - 2829.48] milligrams that's just what I would do I
[2827.64 - 2831.32] would do a lot you know I would do a lot
[2829.48 - 2832.80] more I would do about you know 3 4,000
[2831.32 - 2835.12] milligrams if you
[2832.80 - 2836.80] can and then you know I still would eat
[2835.12 - 2838.40] potatoes and I would go plant-based you
[2836.80 - 2840.04] get your trigeminal neuralgia better go
[2838.40 - 2842.04] back to your Animal product diet if you
[2840.04 - 2843.52] want stay off of dairy stay off of eggs

[2859.72 - 2864.12] illness stay away from it but when
[2862.72 - 2866.36] you're dealing with treem Neurology you
[2864.12 - 2868.92] want to be plant-based if it's too heavy

[3065.36 - 3068.88] trigeminal neuralgia the pain and the
[3067.12 - 3070.48] suffering and the agony that goes along
[3068.88 - 3072.60] with that and you compile that with

[3103.88 - 3108.28] spiritual growth it pushes spiritual
[3105.64 - 3109.52] growth like no other no other I don't
[3108.28 - 3110.92] care if somebody's sitting on top of a
[3109.52 - 3112.92] mountain top and they got their hands
[3110.92 - 3114.40] folded and they're just you know and
[3112.92 - 3115.80] they got their legs crossed and they're
[3114.40 - 3117.12] just you know they're on they're seeking
[3115.80 - 3118.92] spiritual enlightenment let me tell you
[3117.12 - 3120.36] something people who are chronically ill
[3118.92 - 3122.16] chronically suffered who have been
[3120.36 - 3123.00] through hell and back have gone through
[3122.16 - 3125.44] so
[3123.00 - 3127.32] much that's the kind of Enlightenment
[3125.44 - 3129.20] that supersedes all the mountain tops
[3127.32 - 3131.60] anybody can go be marching on to and
[3129.20 - 3133.48] doing not saying don't do that I'm just
[3131.60 - 3134.40] saying for people I'm glad you're doing
[3133.48 - 3137.20] it I'm just
[3134.40 - 3139.48] saying talking about walking over coals
[3137.20 - 3140.64] talking about walking over hot coals I'm
[3139.48 - 3142.16] just going to tell you right now people
[3140.64 - 3143.72] who have actually suffered with real
[3142.16 - 3145.08] problems with real things going on with
[3143.72 - 3146.64] their health neurological problems with
[3145.08 - 3148.28] things xiety and everything else which
[3146.64 - 3150.08] trigeminal neuralgia can create a lot of
[3148.28 - 3151.64] anxiety it can all be part of that
[3150.08 - 3153.68] because of the different frenic nerves
[3151.64 - 3157.44] involved in the Vegas nerves what people
[3153.68 - 3159.40] go through walking on coals is a joke
[3157.44 - 3161.36] it's a damn
[3159.40 - 3163.96] joke all
[3161.36 - 3167.16] right anyway the bottom line is so what
[3163.96 - 3169.00] else can we do for it um so we got we
[3167.16 - 3171.00] got some of the herbs we can do for it
[3169.00 - 3173.28] okay um licorice root for sure that's a
[3171.00 - 3175.48] secret weapon to it without a doubt for
[3173.28 - 3177.28] dral neuralgia turmeric that's a great
[3175.48 - 3180.08] one too you want to consider that one to
[3177.28 - 3181.52] bring that one in and we're dealing with
[3180.08 - 3183.68] a virus so these are really good
[3181.52 - 3185.92] antivirals zinc zinc is a winner for
[3183.68 - 3188.04] trienal neuralgia it's a winner for this
[3185.92 - 3189.96] it's a winner because zinc deficiencies
[3188.04 - 3192.48] allow shingles to be rampant and go
[3189.96 - 3193.84] crazy in the whole bit make sure like I
[3192.48 - 3196.00] said you do the heavy metal detox
[3193.84 - 3199.32] smoothie that that's happening no matter
[3196.00 - 3201.56] what make sure some people they can put
[3199.32 - 3203.24] cold on there and it and it works and
[3201.56 - 3204.84] then some people can't even have to cold
[3203.24 - 3206.68] touch them some people can put warmth on
[3204.84 - 3208.44] their face or their head or the side of
[3206.68 - 3210.76] their head or their neck and sometimes
[3208.44 - 3213.08] that can touch it and sometimes it can't
[3210.76 - 3216.04] people have gone through the gamma with
[3213.08 - 3218.36] all this it's disheartening and and it's
[3216.04 - 3221.32] it's just unbelievable unbelievable what
[3218.36 - 3222.52] people do um Elderberry syrup that's
[3221.32 - 3225.04] helpful too you could take a little
[3222.52 - 3228.04] Elderberry syrup that's helpful okay
[3225.04 - 3230.56] Elder Elder flow tea can be helpful
[3228.04 - 3233.20] elderflower tea that can be helpful with
[3230.56 - 3235.60] trigeminal neuralgia so consider that
[3233.20 - 3238.20] one too listen I'm with you I wish these
[3235.60 - 3240.24] shows were longer um because I I just
[3238.20 - 3242.32] could talk all day to everybody here get
