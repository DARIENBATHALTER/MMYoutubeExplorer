00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,319
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,240
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,800
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,559
secrets about health much of which is

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,719
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,199
ahead of what's out there now this is

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,800
the only Health show anywhere that has

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,920
information where it doesn't come from

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,160
interest groups medical funding with

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,480
strings attached botched research

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,239
lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,719
belief systems private panel of

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,879
influencers health field payoffs are

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,000
trendy traps that are common in

16
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,960
conventional and guess what alternative

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,239
Comm medical communities all the

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,120
information here I share comes from a

19
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,600
pure untampered with Advanced Clean

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,360
Source a higher source the spirit of

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,840
compassion there nothing more healing

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,559
than compassion and the reason why I say

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,239
this that this is the only show because

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
information out there and I have to

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,800
remind new people that are listening to

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,879
the show information out there there has

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,240
cross-contamination or contamination

28
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,360
from long ago attached to it like for

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,520
instance if you ever hear my metabolism

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,920
show you'll know that metab metabolism

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,040
all on its own is totally totally you

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,520
know it's it's complet completely

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,880
there's flaws everywhere there's holes

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,439
in it everywhere it's an ancient it's an

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,240
ancient realization that our bodies are

36
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,720
alive and functioning and it was

37
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,600
ingrained in the early medical schools

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,119
the

39
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,360
universities

40
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,600
globally long ago and then it it got

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,560
grandfathered in his law so now there's

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,240
even lots and lots of metabolism books

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,079
coming out now constantly and just so

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,439
you know it's not even feasible

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,680
everybody burns calories differently and

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,680
at different times you can't gauge that

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,479
that's not even gauge B and that's part

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,240
of metabolism there's a lot of other

49
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,640
things that are wrong with metabolism we

50
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,439
talked about but I'm using that as an

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
example of how when something's

52
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,039
grandfathered in because of early

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,879
funding early funding that's usted

54
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,920
grandfather law documents that you guys

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,400
don't even realize that are sitting in

56
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,920
vaults in ancient University vaults that

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,680
you can't mess with so metabolism will

58
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,280
live on forever and nobody will even get

59
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,360
it and realize that it's a liver problem

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,040
that it's problems with the body you

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,440
know that the all kind we talk about on

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,760
the metabolism show we're going to talk

63
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,280
about it again but that's just one prime

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,480
example another prime example is

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Hashimoto till this day until I brought

66
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,720
forward that the body doesn't attack

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,080
itself okay because that's grandfathered

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,760
in that's grandfathered in from the

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,040
1950s that that autoimmune is your body

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
destroying itself that's grandfathered

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,319
Ino this is because of early funding

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,360
that went into something and it's

73
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,840
poisoned because it's wrong information

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,800
and the best experts in in thyroid

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
Health right now are still putting out

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,480
information that sure they're saying hey

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,680
it's triggers they're finally picking up

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,040
on that hey it's this and that you eat

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,640
better you start getting a little bit

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,120
better your numbers get a little bit

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
better on your thyroid but they still

82
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,040
think the body's attacking itself

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,599
instead of what I've been teaching all

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
along that there's an Invader and a

85
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,720
virus that gets inside the thyroid that

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,239
literally is the sole reason for

87
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,640
hypothyroidism and and and Hashim Modas

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
and everything but these are examples of

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,120
how it's all contaminated I'm sorry to

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,840
say it's sad to say there's nothing I

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,840
can do about it besides give you guys

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,879
the truth all the time and give you guys

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,239
Advanced information that doesn't have

94
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,319
prec contamination that everybody's

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,599
still passing around and that's why

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,799
you're listening to the show that is why

97
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,319

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,479
shouldn't have Parkinson's disease it

185
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,840
shouldn't be what it is there are

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
hundreds of neurological mystery

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,879
conditions what's the cause of

188
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,319
Parkinson's out there unknown

189
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,639
unknown exactly

190
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,319
unknown that's the cause of Parkinson

191
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,479
out there here we are in this day and

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,960
age where we sit now it's unknown

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,199
because guess what in medical research

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
and medical science and medical

195
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,919
communities I'm just going to tell you

196
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,639
right now all chronic illness is unknown

197
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,919
I'm sorry but all chronic illness is

198
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,879
unknown it's not unknown here at the

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,599
medical Medium show not because I'm a

200
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,560
wizard a smart you know a smart Wizard

201
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,440
and I got 20 million

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,520
degrees you know in medicine and and

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,759
everything else that's not it at all

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,599
that's not it at all it's it's because

205
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,680
of the information The Source I get it

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,639
from a source that I've helped heal and

207
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,639
helped recover people and and and and

208
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,960
recover and restore lives and bring

209
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,360
their lives back in in third for 35

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,879
years and maybe even more since I was a

211
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,840
little kid a little baby a four years

212
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,199
four years of age and so the whole point

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,800
here about this show is exactly like

214
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,440
Parkinson's disease it shouldn't even

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,479
have its own name it should just be

216
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,440
called unknown mystery symptoms once

217
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,680
again let's be honest let's get out of

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,120
medical denial it's so painstaking I

219
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,839
can't even tell you I go through waves

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,720
waves in my life you guys waves where I

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,360
just I just you know bite my lip and I

222
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,279
and I say all right I I fine fine I get

223
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
it um no one knows what's wrong with

224
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,000
anybody I get it except when it's

225
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,680
mechanical I get it okay um yeah I could

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
live with that let's Forge ahead Spirit

227
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,160
let's Forge ahead keep on helping people

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
and then it and it eats me up sometimes

229
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,160
and then and then I I kind of let it out

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I let it out and it's absurd it's just

231
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,760
nonsense the way it works with chronic

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,920
and mystery illness I'm not talking

233
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,160
about I'm not talking about if you need

234
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,920
a if you need you know a tooth filled at

235
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,600
the dentist office I'm not talking about

236
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,839
if you really have a heart valve problem

237
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,240
because it's damaged maybe damaged

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,640
mysteriously and mechanical problem

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,200
could be mysteriously damaged absolutely

240
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,160
mysteriously damaged viruses get into

241
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,480
people's hearts and cause damage in the

242
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,079
valves and the ventricles and and and

243
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,640
that's what happens and and hey maybe

244
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,600
medicine and research and science

245
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,440
doesn't know why doesn't know why or

246
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,040
maybe somebody's diet is so bad that

247
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
they're just getting you know they're

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
just getting fats fats just caked inside

249
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,640
their heart and inside their veins and

250
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,160
inside their arteries for too long and

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,720
you know and and this stuff is just

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,000
growing in there and breaking off and

253
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,720
causing heart attacks and problems like

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,480
that that and and believe it or not even

255
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,640
partially that's a mystery even though

256
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
it's it's it's not so mysterious

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,560
depending on

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
diets but the point is is even though

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,160
medicine you know today in science has

260
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,519
incredible things thank God and they're

261
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,399
still moving forward including

262
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,560
alternative medicine still moving

263
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,800
forward and and and thank goodness for

264
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,959
this we're still in a world of mystery

265
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,800
with the health and we really are there

266
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,560
are children all across this country

267
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,680
alone never mind globally that are sick

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,800
and they're all just well by the way

269
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
they're all just being thrown into the

270
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,639
lime trap that's where it all goes now I

271
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,200
got to keep on saying that because

272
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,440
that's where it's all going now 15 years

273
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
from now everybody's going to on the

274
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,519
planet's going to have Lyme disease and

275
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,399
every mysterious illness and condition

276
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,680
people are just going to throw their

277
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,880
hands up in the air and it's going be

278
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,920
like it's Lyme disease when it's not but

279
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
I got to tell you so when it comes down

280
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,120
to neurological problems and you'll look

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,360
at Parkinson's it's a hot mess it is

282
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,360
such a

283
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,600
hot hot freaking mess it's not even

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,880
funny it's it's that bad it's one of

285
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,079
those just like ALS is a hot mess and we

286
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,639
talk about that we talked about that

287
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,800
with the ALS show and with Parkinson's

288
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,040
Parkinson used to originally started out

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,160
where it's this Tremor someone's got a

290
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,360
Tremor they got a shake you know their

291
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,279
head's shaking um their leg shaking

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,480
uncontrollably it's getting real stiff

293
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,399
their arms shaking their hand shaking

294
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,800
tremoring tremoring and and gets in the

295
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,040
way of functioning and then the

296
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,519
neurological meltdown occurs uh years

297
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,279
later or anything like that and that's

298
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,000
that's what it originated

299
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,000
with but now even even medicine has to

300
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,920
back itself up it has to protect itself

301
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,920
so grandfathered law medicine has to say

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
well you know wait a minute you know the

303
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,959
the the best clinics are discovering

304
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,639
that Parkinson's is also these other

305
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,839
things that you know little bit of

306
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,600
dementia uh some delusion some psychosis

307
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,360
well wait a minute wasn't that other

308
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,240
other illnesses that were diagnosed

309
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,040
differently back in the past we we you

310
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,240
mean you're bringing those in now so you

311
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,240
were wrong about Parkinson's to begin

312
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,120
with so wrong that now you guys got to

313
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
bring in other crap that's going on with

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
people so you got to be bringing in

315
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,320
other symptoms other conditions you got

316
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,760
to bring up other mysterious symptoms

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,160
conditions neurologically that you have

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,160
no clue no matter what's going on in the

319
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,279
best clinics I won't mention the clinics

320
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
to just just dial in best medical

321
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,680
clinics and three will come up four will

322
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,399
come up it's a joke it's a total total

323
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,120
total joke and you know and that and and

324
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,920
by the way I've known people that had to

325
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
come to me over the last few decades

326
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,160
that have been to every Clinic those

327
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,079
best clinics over and over again and

328
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,279
just the the answers they get at these

329
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:50,839
clinics I used to get and still get now

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,519
I mean would just make your head spin I

331
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,199
swear to God maybe you maybe you're one

332
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,320
of them maybe you're one of them I mean

333
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,959
those clinics originally used to tell

334
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,480
people they were the king of telling

335
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,120
people they had nothing wrong with them

336
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,639
it's all in your head and you need to

337
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,240
you're bored you need to get a job you

338
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,959
need to do something with your life they

339
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,880
were the king of that then they they

340
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,279
they try to elevate they try to advance

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,160
then they brought in all the holistic

342
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,560
people in there the clinics now are kind

343
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,920
of a hash Posh and it's just

344
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,360
unbelievable but see what happened was

345
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,399
it was a failure with Parkinson's just

346
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,199
like a failure with so many other

347
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,720
illnesses I'm being harsh today I'm

348
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,720
being harsh today oh my my God I'm being

349
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,760
harsh today listen I can't help it I

350
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,639
can't help it you you guys got to

351
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,839
understand I can't help it sometimes

352
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,440
sometimes it just you know it's so

353
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,360
ridiculous for real so it was a failure

354
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,839
so now they had to bring up bring in all

355
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,040
these other items call items all these

356
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,120
other conditions all these other

357
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,040
symptoms and they kind of the reason why

358
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
is because the minute something starts

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,199
to

360
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,959
stink something starts to stink and that

361
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,959
grandfather-in-law starts to stink way

362
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,759
too much it's it's it's time it es and

363
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,240
flows a little differently so then you

364
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,120

366
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,399

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:27,519
Neurosis um you got uh aches and pains

370
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,680

375
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,199
to throw that one into

376
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,759
that what a mess up mystery aches and

377
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,360
pains that yes are neurological nerve

378
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:55,240
pain but throw it into the Parkinson's

379
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,040
package now because it was a failure

380
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,279
diagnosis and a failure understanding

381
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,600
everything about it is

382
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,839
flawed no answers completely unknown

383
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,440
just like everything else including

384
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,639
autoimmune yeah that's right that's

385
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,680
right and so why don't we throw in aches

386
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,320
and pains how about that how about them

387
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,720
how about those apples how about them

388
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,199
apples how do you like those apples so

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,600
you know and by the way apples are

390
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,079
really good for Parkinson's apples are

391
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,720
really good for Parkinson's let's not

392
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
forget that right now I got to remember

393
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,920
that hey here's the

394
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,759
deal here's the deal there's so many

395
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,800
different neurological conditions and

396
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,720
symptoms they're all mystery they're all

397
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,199
mystery unless you've been hit by a

398
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,040
car they're all mystery unless you fell

399
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,759
off a building they're all mystery

400
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,040
unless you know you fell on your face on

401
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,440
a sidewalk which happens to everybody at

402
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,519
some time in their life I don't care who

403
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
it is you know and and you know they're

404
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,800
they're all mystery unless you know you

405
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,519
get chemical poisoned chemically

406
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,440
poisoned someone spraying you know

407
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,240
pesticides and fertilizer your neighbors

408
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,160
got fertilizer going in you know

409
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,560
pesticides going in their lawn you don't

410
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,160
have that in your lawn but they got it

411
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,160
going in their lawn your an apartment

412
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,800
building and you walk outside and some

413
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,839
guy's sitting there with a tank on the

414
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,120
back on his back and he's got a sprayer

415
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,639
in his hand he doesn't see you and he

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,399
sprays you right in the face as you walk

417
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,839
by which happens all the time 3 days

418
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,360
later that person's getting mystery

419
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,759
neurological symptoms but there's a

420
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,519
reason for that if they know how to

421
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,000
connect the dots to

422
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,160
that and you know these are all injuries

423
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,639
they're

424
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,560
injuries yeah that's right that's right

425
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,560
that's right so here's here's the deal

426
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,240
here's the deal so if you've been

427
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,839
diagnosed with label lime disease

428
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,120
neurological lime how do you like that

429
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,079
one now exactly it goes there

430
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,720
Parkinson's and that's the whole thing

431
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,519
too just so you know a lot of the

432
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
Parkinson's crowd is getting thrown into

433
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,040

shopping they get get to a lime doctor

437
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,160
and guess what they're diagnosed with

438
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,039
they don't have Parkinsons they've had

439
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,640
lime the whole time you know I just you

440
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,600

441
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,319
bang my head on the desk right now I'd

442
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,959
like to do

443
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,640
that and here here's the deal here's the

444
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,400
deal so you know so a lot of the a lot

445
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,679
of the multiple scos people they're all

446
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,240
multiple sclerosis people they're all

447
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,919
getting thrown into this doctor

448
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,439
searching I didn't have M mess this

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,799
whole time oh wait a minute I've had

450
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,360
lime this whole time it's

451
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,840
painful

452
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,720
painful because they've suffered as it

453
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,720
is and and suffered as it is and I get

454
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,039
it a new diagnosis can be refreshing and

455
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,240
I get that I totally get that don't I'm

456
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,840
not making I'm not jabbing at that that

457
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,559
part I'm jabbing at the fact that it's

458
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,919
it's still nobody knows what's going on

459
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,280
they don't that's why we do this show

460
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,520
that's why we do this

461
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,880
show so what creates neurological

462
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,200
problems what creates

463
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,840
Parkinson's what do we do there you know

464
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
and and to begin with we have to talk

465
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,240
about what's happening in the brain

466
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,240
something got into the brain something

467
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,400
got into the brain and and things get

468
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,480
into the brain mildly with all kinds of

469
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,919
neurological problems you can have a

470
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,440
virus in your liver like Epstein bar

471
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,600
just a virus in your liver it's not in

472
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,640
your brain it's in your liver it's

473
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,760
releasing a poison and science and

474
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,760
research has no idea about this this is

475
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,440
so ahead of their time so Advanced you

476
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,440
know you know it's part of how you know

477
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,440
part of why I have to say it this way

478
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,600
part of why I have to say it this way

479
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,200
it's because it's that bad out there

480
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,840
it's that bad out there know you when

481
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,159
you put out book one the medical meum

482
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
you think the world's going to change

483
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm like okay Spirit I'll put this out

484
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,799
the world's going to change all at once

485
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,760
it's not going to change all at once I

486
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,520
still see some of the best practitioners

487
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,440
best practitioners out there meaning the

488
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,600
most advanced experts out there they

even have a clue what's in book one many

490
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,320

move this

515
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,400
forward so here's how it works when it

516
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,520
comes down to Parkinson's or any kind of

517
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,600
symptom that's being thrown into any of

518
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,520
these things you can have a virus inside

519
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,280
the liver sitting there could be hhv6 it

520
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
could be shingles it could be Epstein

521
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,720
bar most of the time Epstein bar loves

522
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,000
to sit in there and and release poisons

523
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,520
and when that Poison's released you

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,400
could get stiffness in the body they can

525
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,000
be like stiff you can also get a little

526
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,200
fatigue because it's just poison

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
floating around there irritating the

528
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,080
nervous

529
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,159
system you can get aches and

530
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,280
pains just from a simple little bug

531
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,280
sitting in the liver no big deal no big

532
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:37,159
deal there's no Panic there's no

533
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:42,080
Parkinson's there no Parkinson's at

534
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:45,039
all and what happens is the Tremor of

535
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,760
Parkinson's the Tremor of Parkinson's

536
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,799
the shakiness you guys is heavy metals

537
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,120
in the brain it's heavy metals in the

538
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,760
brain so if you're someone that's got

539
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,760
some serious mercury in the brain which

540
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,039
they're never going to ever really admit

541
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,679
yeah you can go to clinics find a

542
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,120
holistic doctor be like you know you got

543
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,679
you know elevated we're doing a hair

544
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,320
analysis you got to elevated toxic heavy

545
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,480
metals but it's still never going to be

546
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,880
grandfathered in itself into real study

547
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,240
and science to figure out where where

548
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,520
the metals are in the brain how it works

549
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,520
I talk about this in the heavy metal

550
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,520
detox I mean the heavy metal um show and

551
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,080
and the tremor from Parkinson's is

552
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,080
separate and you can still have a Tremor

553
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,720
without even it being like a Parkinson's

554
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,840
Tremor that real bad shaky Tremor the

555
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,760
bad shaky Tremor that's got people's

556
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
head shaking and it's got their arm

557
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
shaking and it's got I mean it's it's in

558
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,960
the

559
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,840
way that's a serious Mercury deposit

560
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,720
that's that's that's bleeding not blood

561
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,640
it's bleeding over it's like runoff it's

562
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,840
like a factory you got a

563
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,559
factory you got a factory out there okay

564
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,720
and in some field big old factory and

565
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,799
they're just manufacturing poisons out

566
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,760
there some big old corporations some

567
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,720
ugly Corporation not good ones ugly one

568
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,640
and they're just they're just dumping

569
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
these poisons out into a little bit of a

570
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,880
a

571
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,080
river and it goes into one River and it

572
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
starts to bleed out of the fields into

573
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,760
that River what happens is the Mercury

574
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,960
sits there it ages it it it breaks down

575
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,600
and it

576
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,279
bleeds

577
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,960
dentists actually are aware of this

578
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,559
better than anywhere anybody else in

579
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,480
medical research and science even if a

580
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,640
dentist doesn't realize it they know

581
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,200
that the the Mercury tattoos you get

582
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,159
Mercury tattoos from from old uh mgms

583
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,760
you know the Mercury tattoos in the gums

584
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,919
they know that that's that's bled over

585
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,640
from the old Mercury amalgam they're the

586
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,120
only ones that understand it even if

587
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,720
they don't even though if they didn't

588
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,360
even connect the dots ever to realize

589
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,039
that when you got mercury in somebody's

590
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,279
brain and it starts to bleed over and it

591
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,320
doesn't mean you're getting a Mercury

592
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,039
technically in your brain brain from

593
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Mercury amalgam but I'm just saying you

594
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,679
could get a little but you know there's

595
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,799
plenty other places to get mercury in

596
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,520
the brain I'm telling you right now I'm

597
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,320
telling you right now so when that

598
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,279
mercury up there starts to bleed over

599
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,640
into tissue starts to run into that

600
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,039
River toxic waste running down that

601
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,360
field and hitting that River from that

602
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,440
big old corporate Factory

603
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,480
right you know that b big place and then

604
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,440
you know and it and it and it bleeds

605
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,520
over into the river and runs out

606
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,480
out what happens

607
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,039
is it starts to saturate other tissue I

608
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,760
want to saturates other tissue you got

609
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,440
electrical impulses going crazy they're

610
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,400
going bananas they're bouncing off the

611
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,000
walls they're hitting they're hitting

612
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,080
each

613
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,600
other with the Tremor and shake the big

614
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,559
bad big bad Tremor that means that not

615
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,520
only is an electrical impulse trying to

616
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,440
get somewhere but can't because it's

617
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,919
running into Mercury deposits tissue in

618
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
the brain could be anywhere in the brain

619
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
if it's your arm then it's somewhere

620
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,120
else in the brain if it's your head

621
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
that's shaking it's somewhere else in

622
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,080
the brain if it's your toe that's

623
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,240
shaking it's somewhere else in the

624
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,080
brain and when it's

625
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,640
hitting hitting that mercury

626
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,840
deposit it's not just hitting it because

627
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
you can have hundreds of neurological

628
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,919
conditions that are heavy metal based

629
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,880
that are Mercury based and other metals

630
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,600
hundreds of conditions where it's

631
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,600
hitting the metal but it goes somewhere

632
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,200
else else it reroots

633
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,000
itself but with Parkinson's Tremor

634
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,000
Parkinson's

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,320
shake the bad one it's actually coming

636
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,799
back down the neuron the wrong way

637
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,720
science and research guess when they're

638
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,120
going to discover that I'll be dead I'll

639
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,360
be gone I'll tell you that even if if

640
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,440
you believe in lives coming back or past

641
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,640
lives everybody has different beliefs a

642
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,159
lot of people believe they have all

643
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,080
hundreds of past lives you know know hey

644
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,840
man I'm on board with anybody's belief

645
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,960
system because I I I learn from it too

646
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,360
you know I mean yeah I ask Spirit these

647
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,720
questions and I always ask Spirit hey

648
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,360
does somebody have a past life does

649
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,880
someone you know someone going to have a

650
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,640
a forward life but I like hearing what

651
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
people say because people have intuition

652
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,360
in their own internal soul and Body on

653
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,480
their own personal experience of what

654
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,880
they think about a past life or or

655
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,919
moving forward and and so cuz I like

656
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,200
people have their own you know unique

657
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,120
their own unique you guys do you have

658
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,919
that attachment to your you know to the

659
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,640
whole thing your third eye the pituitary

660
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,960
gland to your soul to your spirit and

661
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,279
you got that hey you know yourself when

662
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,200
it comes down to these things and you

663
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,200
may feel hey I had a past life so then

664
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,559
you know I I go by what people feel

665
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,520
about these things and and you know even

666
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:51,840
if I had 10 more lifetimes in the

667
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,159
future if that's even possible if I had

668
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,480
10 20 more lifetimes they still wouldn't

669
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,000
know that that's what happens with the

670
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,559
electrical impulse electrical impulse

671
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,799
running down in Earth neur on and it

672
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,679
hitting the

673
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,320
Mercury but instead of derailing and

674
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
going into a different part of the brain

675
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,520
tissue which I talk about what happens

676
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,520
for everybody with heavy metal in their

677
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,799
brain giving them you know

678
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,320
ADHD um all different kinds of things

679
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,720
that we talked about autism everything

680
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,919
else not even just that just just normal

681
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,000
quirks and normal OCD OCD like the OCD

682
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,320
show how it goes around how it carries

683
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
information it needs to carry this

684
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,480
information but what happens with

685
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,440
Parkinson's is that neurological that

686
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,000
neurotransmitter okay that electrical

687
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,960
impulse running

688
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,440
running down with what neurotransmitter

689
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,960
chemicals attached to it is what I'm

690
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:46,080
saying running across that neuron it

691
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,240
hits the Mercury deposit and then it

692
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,960
goes back the neuron the other way

693
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,960
that's what the Tremor and the shake is

694
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,960
that will never be discovered in in

695
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,200
science and

696
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,039
research I I don't know when it will be

697
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,520
I don't know and if this if we don't

698
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,799
blow this Earth

699
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,559
up you know 500 years from now a

700
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,440
thousand years from now maybe maybe

701
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,919
science will have a chance to figure

702
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,559
that one

703
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,120
out I don't even know if the show exists

704
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,559
by then

705
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,559
maybe if you'll be able to you know find

706
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:27,760
it and uh so here's the deal so when it

707
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,080
runs back the the uh it runs back the

708
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,559
neuron it it travels the neuron down the

709
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,240
neuron the wrong way because there's a

710
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,880
shock reaction that happens with that

711
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,440
heavy metal in that tissue and I'll tell

712
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,080
you what it

713
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,000
is on the other side of that tissue

714
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,080
there's also a

715
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,559
neurotransmitter that's trying to hit

716
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,320
the wall at the same time it's a Mercury

717
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,760
deposit with neurons and both side of it

718
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,360
with the neurotransmitters trying to hit

719
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,720
the wall at at the same time and then

720
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,200
being shot back down the

721
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,360
neuron cuz even if you didn't have that

722
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,000
see if you didn't have that that neuron

723
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,840
on the other side of the met the metal

724
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,679
deposit the Mercury deposit if you

725
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,640
didn't have it on the other

726
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,559
side okay and then and then that neuron

727
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
that neuron came on the other side came

728
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,919
across and hit the

729
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,519
wall it still would have try to find A

730
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,840
New Path it has another neuron on the

731
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,240
other side of the Mercury deposit

732
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,519
throwing out El electrical impulse

733
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,440
across and slamming into the Mercury at

734
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,279
the same time the other neurons sending

735
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,360
an electrical impulse slamming into the

736
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:49,880
Mercury and there's a short out a short

737
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,240
out of the ultimate kind a short

738
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,120
out and they both shoot back the neuron

739
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,240
the wrong way meaning backwards it's

740
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,880
like driving your car for forward and

741
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,159
then stopping while somebody's behind

742
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,440
you and then slamming it into reverse

743
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,279
and going

744
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,320
back because what's happening is there's

745
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,840
already another electrical impulse

746
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,919
getting ready getting charged up with

747
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,440
neurotransmitter chemicals with mineral

748
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,679
salts precious mineral salts getting

749
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,840
revved up and hot like ready to go like

750
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,320
busting out of the gate like a horse and

751
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,919
a horse

752
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,919
race

753
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,000
you know like an Olympic Athlete like

754
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,679
getting charged up before they go down

755
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,640
that like Sleigh Ride On Ice the death

756
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,399
defying slay ride on ice or an Olympic

757
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,600
Athlete it's about to snowboard 500 feet

758
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,120
in the

759
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,640
air I I don't know why people do that I

760
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,840
mean I get it I get it they got a gift

761
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,919
and the talent for it and but boy does

762
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,399
that scare me I wouldn't do

763
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,399
that if I'm proud of anybody who does

764
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,200
whatever they do that's that's like that

765
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,080
I mean it's amazing here's the thing and

766
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440
as that charge is getting ready as that

767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,519
it's getting ready it's like that skier

768
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,760
the Olympic Athlete skier that he's at

769
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,880
the top or she's at the top about to go

770
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,320
down that slope you you know what's

771
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,399
getting charged up right there you know

772
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,399
what's getting charged up in that

773
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,600
person's brain right can you imagine

774
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,919
what's getting charged up in that

775
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,399
person's brain and in that in that

776
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,760
person's body can you

777
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,440
imagine can you imagine if there was a

778
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,640
skier that was going up the slope

779
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,679
backwards because when they got to the

780
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,399
bottom so the so say there was another

781
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,600
athlete that went down the slope already

782
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,320
can you imagine if that athlete for some

783
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,240
reason even though it's not possible in

784
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,559
this situation all of a sudden start

785
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,840
going back up the slope

786
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,880
backwards with speed while that other

787
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,159
athletes at the top the very top sitting

788
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,240
there getting revved up like you can't

789
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,600
believe to come

790
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,399
down and when that skier jumps off that

791
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,840
slope and comes down and they both

792
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:04,880
Collide

793
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,080
Midway you got

794
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,480
Tremors you got Tremors and shakes

795
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,519
Tremors and shakes that keep you up at

796
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,720
night tremors and shakes that make you

797
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,360
need a tremendous amount of of of you

798
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,440
know of

799
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:25,240
pharmaceuticals I won't name all the far

800
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Pharmaceuticals but yeah all that Pharma

801
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,399
that you need to try to control it those

802
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,639
in the

803
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,720
shakes and there's that explosion that

804
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:35,360
occurs when those two hit when those two

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,080
skiers hit on that slope one going up

806
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,840
the hill backwards full speed and

807
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,080
another one coming down full speed all

808
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,720
charged up and when they hit an

809
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,240
explosion

810
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,000
occurs this explosion is equivalent to a

811
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,600
massive

812
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,279
bomb a massive bomb on planet

813
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,639
Earth that's what it's equivalent to

814
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,120
internally in the

815
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,279
brain yeah your head doesn't explode

816
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,480
it's different it's different on a scale

817
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,159
that can't be measured and and that's

818
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,399
what happens and so you got two neurons

819
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,679
there's a big hunk of mercury slammed in

820
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,519
the

821
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:20,480
center you

822
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,679
know and and that those electrical

823
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,519
charges are are being launched down that

824
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,760
neuron across that neuron and hitting

825
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,240
the metal deposit one on each side of

826
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,240
the metal

827
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,919
deposit and then they're bouncing back

828
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,440
after that explosion with another charge

829
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:42,720
running down that neuron that hits it at

830
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,960
the same time over and over and over and

831
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,600
over and over again and that's why

832
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,279
Parkinson's disease a lot of brain

833
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,360
surgeons have to go in there and they

834
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,799
have to cut

835
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,039
tissue cut nerves they have to open up

836
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,039
somebody's brain and they got to go they

837
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,000
got to go

838
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,320
searching

839
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,440
which is actually amazing that's that's

840
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,760
part of you know you know neurosurgeons

841
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,360
are are miracle workers many of them are

842
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,919
and that's the part of science I like in

843
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,200
general I'm not saying go get you know

844
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,519
your brain opened up I'm talking about

845
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
we're going to remove heavy metals but

846
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,480
the point is is I'm talking about how

847
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,200
science you know we could still remove

848
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,960
aneurysms out of people's brains and

849
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,279
save their lives with robots with like a

850
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,240
surgeon in the back playing around with

851
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,720
controls it's pretty amazing so I mean

852
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,600
there's all kinds of parts of science I

853
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,240
love just never get me wrong when I just

854
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,960
rip apart chronic illness I can't help

855
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,240
it if I don't rip apart chronic illness

856
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,639
nothing's going to change Spirit told me

857
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,639
that Spirit told me that Spirit doesn't

858
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,200
like my delivery Spirit doesn't like the

859
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:44,639
way I rip things apart Spirit would

860
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,840
rather have me do it in a way that

861
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:50,750
Spirit would like which is soothing calm

862
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,159
wonderful but that's not

863
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,960
[Laughter]

864
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,000
me I said spirit this is who you picked

865
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,320
this is who you got this is the best I

866
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,880
got all right just you know leave me be

867
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,000
and here's here's the deal here's the

868
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,480
deal that's what happens with

869
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Parkinson's as part of as far as the big

870
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Tremor as far as the big Shake part as

871
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,679
far as everything else the multitude of

872
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,159
symptoms that happen it's so many

873
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,159
different heavy metals in the in

874
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,520
different deposits copper aluminum you

875
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,440
got lead you got Mercury you got arsenic

876
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,280
you got cadmium you got there's more

877
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,800
than that you got Alloys you got Alloys

878
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,200
someone has copper in their head and

879
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,960
they got mercury in their head you

880
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,879
wouldn't believe what happens when you

881
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,000
got two things in your head you got

882
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,119
aluminum copper Mercury you get these

883
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,359
alloy

884
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,960
compositions and you get this alloy

885
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,240
brain and then all kinds of symptoms can

886
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,320
occur but but with neurological

887
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,200
neurological conditions you can have the

888
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,800
viral conditions you can have viruses

889
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,919
feeding off of heavy metals viruses that

890
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,919
reside in our body and you can even get

891
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,480
a virus in the brain you better believe

892
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,960
believe that you know it's the most

893
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,320
bizarre thing ever I got to tell you is

894
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,560
there was a drug commercial on and one

895
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,359
of the side effects was it you may be

896
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,440
one of those rare people that get a

897
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,440
virus to the brain because of this

898
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,359
drug now I'm like somebody

899
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,200
somebody knows that viruses get into the

900
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,000
brain out there something meaning

901
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,000
somebody out there knows

902
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,680
it now what virus are they talking about

903
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,960
they probably don't even know what virus

904
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,000
are they talking about what family are

905
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,599
they talking about don't even know don't

906
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,440
even know but they just know that

907
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,079
somebody can get a virus in the brain

908
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,760
I'm glad we're that far with research

909
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,680
and science so in some cases

910
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,920
neurological conditions you can get

911
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,440
absolutely you can get the hhv 6 in the

912
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,119
brain hhv 10 11 12 those are

913
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,240
undiscovered by the way you go on the

914
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,160
internet and you say what's he talking

915
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,359
about

916
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,079
hh12 it doesn't exist no it does exist

917
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:03,800
it's just not

918
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,319
discovered and and spirit knows this so

919
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,560
I'm working on the perimeters of what

920
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:08,240
people know now and I have to be

921
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,920
cautious to how far I push it and how

922
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,119
far I go because it's so far ahead of

923
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,560
the

924
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,079
game so here's the deal when it comes

925
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,760
down to Parkinson's you think you got

926
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,119
Parkinson's whatever it is I mean

927
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,440
whatever it is neurological line

928
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,319
whatever it is first of all you got to

929
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,000
work work on getting heavy metals out so

930
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:27,560
you don't have a fuel for a virus a

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,920
viral condition

932
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:33,440
so you don't have a fuel for a viral

933
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,000
condition that's what you got to do ALS

934
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,839
Ms a million different symptoms and

935
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,760
conditions with you know hundreds and

936
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,119
hundreds and hundreds of medical names

937
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,319
now we have for neurological

938
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,880
conditions hundreds of them so a lot of

939
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:48,480
doctors a lot of doctors and Clinics

940
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,160
wanted their name on

941
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,000
something okay so you know I get it I

942
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,160
get it it's like uh it's like almost

943
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,160
sometimes in the case of of of whatever

944
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,920
you know someone someone's in a career

945
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,720
and they want their name on something I

946
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,079
get it so there's a lot of different

947
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,560
diseases and illnesses with names on

948
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:08,720
them and whatever these names are

949
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,119
whatever it is over the years we still

950
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,359
have to look at heavy metals and we have

951
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,880
to look at viruses anything Parkinson's

952
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:18,040
related anything e it doesn't mean you

953
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,319
have a virus in your brain it doesn't

954
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,480
you get have multiple sclerosis and

955
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,560
never have a virus in your brain or

956
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,480
anything you can have all these

957
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,000
different symptoms and conditions you

958
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,800
could have the lesions you can have all

959
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,920
the different you know neurolog iCal

960
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,079
symptoms and and you can just literally

961
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,160
have simply an epine bar in the liver

962
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,240
just releasing some

963
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,800
neurotoxins neurotoxins are poop that

964
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,880
came out of the virus but then guess

965
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,400
what you look that up and guess what

966
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,760
you're going to find you guys viruses

967
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,760
don't eat viruses don't eat I love when

968
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,960
someone tries to correct me on

969
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,319
that on Facebook or some article or

970
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,839
something somebody who just they just

971
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,319
can't

972
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,720
stand the fact that this information's

973
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,240
out there they hate it I there's people

974
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,119
that don't hate it they love the fact

975
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,920
it's information's getting out there and

976
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,920
they love it they the professionals that

977
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,800
love that and but they hate there's some

978
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,720
that hate it and they say viruses don't

979
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,839
eat anything look this up I knew this

980
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,319
I'm a biologist viruses don't eat

981
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:31,160
viruses eat they eat

982
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:34,240
they drink well they don't drink they

983
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,040
eat eat and drink it's all the

984
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,839
same and they bring it in they bring in

985
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,920
food that makes them Thrive heavy metals

986
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,440
are one of

987
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:49,200
them heavy metals are one of them if you

988
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,440
stick mercury in a solution of viruses

989
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,000
say you single out viruses I don't care

990
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,400
what virus it is that you single it out

991
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,280
you put it in a vial with Mercury the

992
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,520
Mercury will keep that virus

993
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:07,960
alive it'll keep that virus alive for a

994
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:12,520
long time how is that possible that a

995
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:16,760
that mercury in a vial will keep a virus

996
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,839
alive how does it do that how does it do

997
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,760
that it keeps those bugs alive because

998
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:23,200
those bugs are feeding off of the

999
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,440
Mercury it's food so the bug can stay

1000
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,160
alive and eat and

1001
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,079
live

1002
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,880
so here's the

1003
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,119
deal there's all these different

1004
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:39,480
neurological conditions tingles numbness

1005
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,319
aches and pains okay restless legs

1006
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,920
everything all right and and we've

1007
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:46,599
covered a lot of details in a lot of

1008
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,359
this show about CFS fibromyalgia about

1009
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,720
the Epstein bars that create so much of

1010
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:52,640
this about the tingles and numbness

1011
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,160
Epstein Epstein bar creates and so many

1012
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,000
different um symptoms that we deal with

1013
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,400
in vagus nerve condition conditions

1014
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,480
frenic nerves conditions where you know

1015
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,920
you got pains all over your ears and

1016
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,880
head got pains on your forehead you got

1017
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,040
ticks you got all these different things

1018
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,520
spasms and all these neurological

1019
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,920
problems and they talk about the viruses

1020
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,560
and what happens with the viruses and

1021
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,880
how the viruses work with all this and

1022
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,560
it's the heavy metals that's the other

1023
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,040
hand of it but when it comes down to

1024
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,440
Parkinson's Parkinson's is mercury

1025
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,480
deposits of mercury and I'm sure someone

1026
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,599
with Parkinson's has more they got all

1027
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,359
kinds of of heavy metal in there but the

1028
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,319
Mercury there's a reaction that happens

1029
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,240
with those electric impulses that shoot

1030
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:36,000
back like I explained that cause the

1031
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,119
ultimate Tremors and the shakes of of

1032
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,160
Parkinson's but the medical world is so

1033
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,520
confused with Parkinson's all on its own

1034
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,079
that they know they had to add to it so

1035
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,440
they add a ton of symptoms now to

1036
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:53,000
Parkinson's it's all a HH posos and a

1037
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,720
confusion totally totally now they don't

1038
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,720
even care about Tremors and shakes

1039
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,200
anymore they just care about delusion

1040
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,400
dementia and stiffness with it let me

1041
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,880
tell you something someone with dementia

1042
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,319
is is is they have they have toxic heavy

1043
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,560
metals in their brain causing the

1044
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:11,680
dementia that's number one their

1045
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,599
stiffness is from an Epstein bar that

1046
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,760
has nothing to do with that that's just

1047
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,359
somebody with later stage Epstein bar

1048
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,760
with body stiffness that you can heal

1049
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,440
from that you can't EP Epstein bar can't

1050
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,560
hurt you

1051
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,839
you can stop it once you know the truth

1052
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,040
about it and once you know the truth

1053
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,400
about viruses and once you know the

1054
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,040
truth about why you got neurological

1055
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,960
lime and why you don't feel good and why

1056
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,960
you got all these different problems you

1057
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,000
can heal this you can get better you

1058
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,800
can't epine you EP bar can't stop you

1059
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,079
the power you have when you know what it

1060
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,880
is besides you know I I even like

1061
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,760
Epstein Barb because you know what it in

1062
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,839
in other viruses and other bugs because

1063
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,520
it pushes you to it pushes you to a

1064
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:01,680
place you never thought you'd ever be

1065
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,680
with your your life in good ways because

1066
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,839
then you overcome it and then you become

1067
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,640
a Force nobody could touch including no

1068
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,200
virus can touch and nothing can touch it

1069
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,640
can become a Force and and ride over it

1070
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,800
and not be held down and

1071
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,119
stopped and rise above

1072
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,880
it but here's the

1073
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,400
deal see so somebody has dementia or

1074
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,200
they got some kind of symptom that's

1075
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,319
related they got Neurosis or they got

1076
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,400
you know something in the Alzheimer's

1077
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,559
category whatever it is that's that's

1078
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,480
somebody with a lot of heavy metals in

1079
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,559
the brain no question but they might all

1080
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,440
of a sudden have some fatigue and

1081
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,359
stiffness which is also a viral

1082
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,520
condition but that's never figured out

1083
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,920
it's never put into it they can they

1084
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,480
can't organize this nothing can be

1085
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,800
organized in modern medicine

1086
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,880
conventionally an alternative like it

1087
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,160
needs to be the alternative is way

1088
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,040
better obviously it's way

1089
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,200
better you know and and and I worry that

1090
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,280
alternative medicine has blended into

1091
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,960
conventional medicine they blend it

1092
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,680
together I worry about that back in the

1093
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,960
older days back in the 80s they were so

1094
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,599
separated and maybe that wasn't good

1095
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,559
either that they were so separated they

1096
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,960
were separated literally there wouldn't

1097
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,880
be a clinic with a natural practitioner

1098
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,079
the first ND was in California in the

1099
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,280
very early 80s the first naturopath in

1100
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,839
California in the very early 80s I know

1101
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,960
personally that it it's it's it was like

1102
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,119
it was like they were so divided

1103
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,000
conventional and alternative but the

1104
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:37,880
good part about that was the alternative

1105
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,079
didn't want to touch any of the old

1106
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,920
grandfathered garbage that was all wrong

1107
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,119
about conventional medicine didn't want

1108
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,760
to touch

1109
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,599
it and now though you know alternative

1110
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,240
medicine's kind of Blended in together

1111
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,000
so what that means is when conventional

1112
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,160
medicine just felt like they discovered

1113
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,640
that the body attacks itself with a

1114
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,920
theory but back of the 50s that

1115
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,319
autoimmune is the body destroying itself

1116
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,760
that the alternative medicine because

1117
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,800
they're blending now you got all these

1118
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,000
young people young doctors coming out of

1119
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,599
it they believe that grandfather law and

1120
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,640
that's the part that's the mistake about

1121
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,839
blending those two

1122
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,160
together you know we need to still be

1123
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:16,800
separated with some ideas but still be

1124
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,720
together with others it's so hard to

1125
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,119
figure that out so that's why this show

1126
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,000
is different it's why you listen to this

1127
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,960
show so you know what's really happening

1128
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,359
so we all can learn I'm not I'm not hard

1129
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,119
on doctors I think they're greatest

1130
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:30,160
thing in the world I'm talking about the

1131
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,119
system itself it's a whole another game

1132
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,440
here's the deal so with

1133
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,200
Parkinson's you want the metals out I

1134
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,520
like the heavy metal detox it's my

1135
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,000
favorite you know the the the heavy

1136
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,800
metal detox the medical medium heavy

1137
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,319
metal

1138
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,559
detox you you got you got to invest in

1139
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:50,880
that thing it's a good thing chaga

1140
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:52,559
mushroom I really like I use the viy

1141
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
chaga mushroom the

1142
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,040
viy and that's the one I use check it

1143
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,160
out you know that's the one I use um you

1144
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:05,160
know that that's a great one and and um

1145
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,760
that's great too for all of this it's

1146
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,280
great for this because the vimergy uh

1147
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,119
cha mushroom powder I like it because it

1148
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,599
it dissolves so well and what I like

1149
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,280
about it is it gets deeper into the

1150
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,880
liver it kills off viruses so if you're

1151
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,480
someone that doesn't even you don't know

1152
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,760
what you have and it's neurological I

1153
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,880
like using chaga for neurological for

1154
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,319
you know for for breaking down viruses

1155
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,760
breaking down the Epstein bar breaking

1156
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,160
down other viruses

1157
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,920
but you know when it comes down to

1158
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,119
neurological you need the B12 that's

1159
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,400
critical you need the B12 I talk about

1160
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,520
the one I talk about you know you know

1161
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,280
there's a lot of different things you

1162
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,640
can get too I like Coen coenzyme Q10

1163
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,319
when it comes down to

1164
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,760
Parkinson's um um I like glutathione

1165
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,440
when it comes down to neurological

1166
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,440
problems and Parkinson glutathione okay

1167
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,880
and you can you can go to medical

1168
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,319
medium.com and look up the right kind

1169
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,280
don't don't get a don't spend $80 I

1170
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,839
don't sell supplements but I got a

1171
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,200
directory though don't spend $80 on a

1172
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,160
really bad

1173
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,160
glutathione that doesn't that doesn't

1174
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,440
even work um I like spirina but that's

1175
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,640
part of the heavy metal detox okay that

1176
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,720
you can use for Parkinson's El

1177
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,000
glutamine um that's a great one uh

1178
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,240
neuromag I like neuromag check that out

1179
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,640
Gaba I like that for Parkinson's a

1180
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,400
little bit of that listen everything you

1181
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,920
just take you know if you you're dealing

1182
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,280
with a conditioner you know somebody

1183
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,800
would condition talk to your holistic

1184
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,520
practitioner bring these bring these

1185
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,119
ideas to that holistic practitioner or

1186
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,800
that conventional practitioner and and

1187
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,440
and work on some of this Sam E I like

1188
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,000
that one for Parkinson's it's a good one

1189
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,839
it's good these These are great because

1190
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,760
it it nourishes supports

1191
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:47,480
neurotransmitters because neurons start

1192
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,160
burning out when that whole thing occurs

1193
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,880
that I mentioned earlier about the

1194
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,319
electrical impulse slamming into each

1195
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,200
other like they do with the Mercury

1196
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:00,359
between them

1197
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:04,280
and basically what it's like is

1198
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:07,839
this you got a metal wall a thin metal

1199
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:12,119
wall okay and you you have you got to

1200
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:13,839
run 20 ft and bang into that wall cuz

1201
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,720
you something inside of you is demanding

1202
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:18,839
that you try to knock that wall down so

1203
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,960
you run full speed 20 fet and you slam

1204
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,000
into that wall get ready at the other

1205
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,839
side of that wall of metal the thin wall

1206
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
of metal there's somebody else running

1207
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,119
full speed at the same time and they

1208
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,839
slam into the wall while you slam into

1209
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:35,240
that thin wall and you guys slam into it

1210
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:37,440
together and then you guys start heading

1211
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,599
back while there's two other people on

1212
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,359
both sides getting ready to run full

1213
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:47,160
speed that's how it happens and then and

1214
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,839
and the neuron Burns Out starts burning

1215
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,839
out and and the neurotransmitter

1216
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:53,160
chemicals start burning out we start

1217
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,960
losing because they're being used up

1218
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,559
used up so I like Samy supports that

1219
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,920
gabit supports that neurom maggot

1220
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,839
supports that Al glutamine supports that

1221
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,160
spirulina supports that glutathione

1222
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:06,359
supports that chaga even supports that

1223
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,480
to some degree even though I like the

1224
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,800
chaga for killing down the viruses

1225
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,440
Siberian jining I like that it's support

1226
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,359
it's supportive for this as well

1227
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,720
supports the

1228
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,040
adrenals in a way that can be helpful

1229
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,559
for Parkinson's any neurological related

1230
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,559
to Parkinson's or any kind of lime

1231
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,920
related neurological anything like that

1232
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,920
Siberian jins sing taking a deep breath

1233
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,559
here I talk so fast sometimes that I I

1234
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,280
don't get air in so just bear with me

1235
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,079
someone said a while back on one of

1236
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,079
these shows you know he sounds weird

1237
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,520
he's breathing in the mic so

1238
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,880
much that's because of a lot of reasons

1239
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,680
because I'm talking so fast I'm thinking

1240
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,359
I'm listening to Spirit all at the same

1241
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,079
time you got to get some air in plus I'm

1242
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:54,599
kissing the mic I'm kissing the mic all

1243
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,400
right that's my mic that I have

1244
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,359
methylfolate

1245
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,359
methylfolate that's another one too you

1246
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,720
bring that in um

1247
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:07,359
MSM methos sophono methylene s MSM I

1248
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,359
don't even think I said that one right

1249
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,160
but that's what it is

1250
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:16,079
MSM so these are some of the supplements

1251
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,839
to be focused on as far as antivirals

1252
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,400
always have a little bit of zinc and you

1253
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,000
always have that going on um I do like a

1254
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,000
little bit of licorice for any kind of

1255
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,359
viral stuff that's going on

1256
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,520
neurologically cat's claw is also I

1257
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:31,960
always say cats claw I've always said

1258
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:35,079
cats claw all the way to the beginning

1259
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,359
years and years and years ago all the

1260
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:38,760
way to the

1261
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:40,400
beginning and and because catclaw is

1262
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,040
great antiviral knocks down those

1263
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,599
Epstein bars knocks down all these

1264
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,319
different things so that's a great one

1265
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,680
too um but you know look if you're

1266
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:50,760
dealing with somebody with any kind of

1267
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,480
Parkinson's related issue any kind of

1268
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,520
issue related neurologically these are

1269
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,200
all helpful you can experiment you can

1270
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,200
bring in a little bit with your doctor

1271
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,079
your practitioner however you want to do

1272
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,359
it but and get the right ones make sure

1273
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:07,240
you're getting the right ones when

1274
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:09,839
you're doing this um and um so the

1275
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,720
bottom line is it's not hopeless when

1276
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,400
you have neurological conditions always

1277
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,359
know that it's not hopeless I've seen

1278
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,680
people with the worst Tremors and shakes

1279
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:21,680
get them to the mild Tremors and shakes

1280
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,119
till they were gone and some people with

1281
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,440
really bad Tremors and shakes I've seen

1282
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,440
it where they've gotten it where it's

1283
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,559
doable where you don't even know it and

1284
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,280
they don't even know it they don't even

1285
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,280
know they still they kind of sense it

1286
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:37,799
here and there buzzing humming inside

1287
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,280
the body is not you know Parkinson's

1288
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:42,680
either you know that's just a lot of

1289
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,880
neurotoxin from a viral condition with

1290
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,559
the buzzing and humming that's inside

1291
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,240
when you feel that it's known so many

1292
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,480
people with neurological symptoms but

1293
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,799
right now Parkinson's get so outdated so

1294
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,240
messed up so flawed and the medical

1295
00:50:55,799 --> 00:51:01,559
world that they had to bring in a list

1296
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,079
of symptoms now they had to file them

1297
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,520
into Parkinson's and here's one of the

1298
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:07,119
reasons you have because it's

1299
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:10,160
grandfathered in with old investors old

1300
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,640
investors of old funding so you got to

1301
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,599
bring in new symptoms to revive it

1302
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,040
because they even know everything's

1303
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,520
going to Lime same thing with multiple

1304
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,200
sclerosis they bring in new symptoms

1305
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,599
because they have to revive that old

1306
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,440
grandfathered interest groups that way

1307
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:32,880
into that it's such a brain screw I

1308
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,760
can't even tell you no pun intended it's

1309
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,440
so

1310
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:40,319
bad it's so bad so we have to rise above

1311
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,599
all of the nonsense of the different

1312
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,760
names of these illnesses get down to the

1313
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,480
root of what's causing the condition

1314
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,960
itself and get working on that and

1315
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,079
realize that it needs an overhaul all

1316
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,480
this needs an overhaul every last

1317
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:58,200
illness every last chronic issue out

1318
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:01,799
there needs an overhaul and that's what

1319
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,400
we're trying to do here in some way when

1320
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:04,559
I was a child spirit said we got a lot

1321
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,240

to need their help to get the

1333

information out there so they can heal

1334
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,599

1335
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,559
story so they can teach others and we're
