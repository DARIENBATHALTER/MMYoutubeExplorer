comprehensive detailed information no

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,360
one wants to be depersonalized being

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,219
numbed out is not something someone

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,379
wants to portray to others or feel

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,480
inside I mean we don't want to feel numb

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,480
inside we want to be able to feel things

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,520
people with depersonalization often

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,740
don't feel as though they've experienced

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,180
what they've just experienced did you

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,740
ever know someone that's gone through

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,399
that have you ever felt that your

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,160
self-wear you had an experience but did

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,260
you feel that experience like it was a

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,379
good experience but you're just too numb

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,480
to feel that experience maybe you were

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,399
with a group of people and everybody had

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,040
a good time but you were felt like you

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,260
were dying inside like you just felt

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,539
like you couldn't connect and you

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,520
couldn't even focus or feel as if you

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,039
were part of it all

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,260
it's almost like a numbness or inability

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,719
to connect others

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,420
to yourself too so it's like you're so

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,820
numb you're so disconnected you can't

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
even feel like you can make

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,040
communication happen with somebody else

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,540
an interaction that feels healthy and

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,100
then you're doubting yourself every

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,619
minute and I've seen this with with

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,000
depersonalization so many people doubt

34
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,619
themselves they don't believe in

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,159
themselves anymore they feel like

36
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,439
they've lost that confidence and when

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,840
you live with depersonalization all the

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,580
confidence disappears and then you feel

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,820
like you're not confident about anything

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,220
even decisions you're making and it's

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,079
even hard to even make decisions with

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,720
depersonalization

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,240
and that's hard too they could be

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,700
standing next to a friend with whom they

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,220
just took a hike with to watch a

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,799
beautiful sunset and they could feel a

47
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,259
disconnect from it all he can literally

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,140
be doing something that's really

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,420
exciting or fun or something that feels

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,600
so good like you watch a sunset but you

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,720
feel so disconnected in your mind and in

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
your head and in your being that you

53
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,680
don't even enjoy it and that other

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,179
person that's with you they're enjoying

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
it and they're like

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,300
incredible Sunset and look and you feel

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,120
like I I can't feel it and that happens

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,640
to so many people it makes it so hard

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,280
it can be experienced as a disconnect

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,800
from oneself a spiritual disconnect too

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
and then with with the personalization

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,640
you feel like you're not spiritually

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
connected and you can't make that

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,200
spiritual connection and you see others

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,360
doing it see other people in yoga class

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,040
and they're just like seem like they're

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,980
like really spiritually connecting and

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,200
they're like well am I connecting too

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,860
they're seeing life from a perspective

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,819
as if they themselves weren't there and

71
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,480
that's another thing with

72
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,160
depersonalization it feels like you're a

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,000
different perspective like you're not

74
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,560
even there it's like you don't exist and

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,959
that's something that happens too you

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,239
guys I'm reading depersonalization in

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,879
the brain saver books really detailed

78
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,060
comprehensive information here

79
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,640
if you've experienced depersonalization

80
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,659
you may have been told you need to find

81
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,060
yourself

82
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,560
I think it's really insulting

83
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,840
when someone's actually really

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,379
struggling with depersonalization I

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,720
think it's insulting to tell them

86
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,120
you need to find yourself that's what it

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,700
really is like just go find yourself

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,340
it's more than that it's more than that

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,319
one person's depersonalization could be

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,040
much different from someone else's and

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,540
that's a whole nother topic there

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,180
everybody's depersonalization could be

93
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,480
different and is different

94
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,599
it's a large gray area bordering the

95
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,340
threshold of depression and anxiety how

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,500
many people do you guys maybe know in

97
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,659
your life that had depersonalization or

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,900
suffering with it now that also have

99
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:01,620
like the anxiety and the depression

100
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,620
along with this depersonalization

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
the classic variety of depersonalization

102
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,840
is the inability to feel emotionally

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,840
that's the classic variety

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,299
you're completely numb nothing excites

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,060
you nothing gets you upset nothing

106
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,280
matters nothing interests you

107
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,160
and you feel like you're not inside your

108
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,900
body and you don't exist a lot of people

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,180
feel this way this is the classic

110
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,080
depersonalization so many people have

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,620
this

112
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,780
even within this classic variety of

113
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,960
depersonalization there can be plenty of

114
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,860
variables what I'm saying is there's no

115
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,300
one-size-fits all for all these symptoms

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,100
and conditions

117
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,840
just like in depersonalization there's

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,180
no one size fits all like your

119
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,639
depersonalization is exactly like yours

120
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,560
and you're the person like no they're

121
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,080
all different there's variables even

122
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,180
with the classic of like I feel numb and

123
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,919
I don't feel like I exist

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,600
it's still different than someone else

125
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,400
who feels numb and feels like they don't

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
exist

127
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,139
the reason for so much variability in

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,020
the experience of depersonalization is

129
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,740
the range of causes There's real causes

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,919
you guys detailed information become an

131
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,740
expert because you can you can become an

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,600
expert you can read the details you can

133
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,340
learn that depersonalization is a

134
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,539
physical problem

135
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,460
physical there's things to actually fix

136
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,639
and that's what's important to know

137
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,840
so these causes range from emotional

138
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,840
injury

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,539
which can create a physical injury

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,060
inside our brain emotional injury to

141
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,940
toxic heavy metals to adrenal burnout

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,440
when we get our adrenals in such a

143
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,900
problem because we're up against so much

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,060
stress emotional abuse problems betrayal

145
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,100
broken trust and our adrenals are just

146
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,259
stepping it up and we're shaking

147
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,880
sometimes you know where you feel like

148
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,460
someone just got you so upset they

149
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,620
triggered you so bad someone triggered

150
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,600
you so bad you're actually shaking and

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,699
you feel it like you're shaking you just

152
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,860
want to run and scream

153
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,680
so these causes can range from all these

154
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,139
things I'm talking about each cause can

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
vary too for example when it comes to

156
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,560
toxic heavy metals there are differences

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,780
from person to person and what type of

158
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,340
metal or metals are in the brain you can

159
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,840
have a different form of toxic heavy

160
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,060
metal in the brain creating a different

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,220
variety of depersonalization

162
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,380
so you can have some different Metals

163
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,979
sprinkled about your brain that are

164
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,500
actually creating your own subset your

165
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:35,400
own unique variety of depersonalization

166
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,160
inside your body inside your brain

167
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,380
the metals reside inside the brain how

168
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,580
close they are to the emotional centers

169
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,020
of the brain here's something people

170
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,400
don't know about like all the medical

171
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,860
medium information has always been

172
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
unique okay it's always been published

173
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,360
first it's always unique

174
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,699
original and here's how it works with

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,160
depersonalization

176
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,319
emotional centers of the brain toxic

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,780
heavy metals that reside closer to the

178
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,060
emotional centers of the brain

179
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,060
can create the depersonalization so

180
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,160
someone may have more metal or a

181
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,660
different variety of metal closer to a

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
certain area of the emotional centers of

183
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,580
the brain when someone else

184
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,800
has another type of metal somewhere on

185
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,600
the back end of the emotional centers of

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,599
the brain in a different section of the

187
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,160
emotional centers of the brain

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,560
and these Details Matter and it matters

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,060
if you're healing if you want to heal if

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,419
you need the information to heal

191
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,639
becoming an expert having the details

192
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,699
the empowerment when you know what's

193
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,919
wrong and how to heal is just it's an

194
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,599
incredible experience all on its own and

195
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,099
here's the thing if you can't experience

196
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,139
because you're suffering and struggling

197
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,759
with depersonalization and you apply the

198
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,660
information

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,419
and you and you learn the details

200
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,940
and that depersonalization starts to

201
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,940
heal that's an experience right there

202
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,340
that's when the numbness lifts up

203
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,440
and the interpersonalization starts to

204
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,900
lift up like a cloud and all of a sudden

205
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,520
you start to experience your own healing

206
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,860
process

207
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,900
while you like everything's being fixed

208
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,580
with depersonalization and many people

209
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,860
have healthy personalization with

210
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,479
medical medium information it's one of

211
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,300
the symptoms and conditions so many

212
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,979
people have but this is so detailed so

213
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,680
comprehensive

214
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,080
it's really worth looking at is brain

215
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,120
fog present do you have brain fog with

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,080
your depersonalization

217
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,479
or is brain fog not present makes a

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,520
difference that's another variable

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
and that's what it's about medical

220
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,240
medium books

221
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,240
you look at the brain saver books it's

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,160
not one size fits all it's the opposite

223
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,800
it's knowing that all these different

224
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,300
variables can happen to someone and

225
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,300
happen inside their brain and body

226
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,920
a low-grade viral infection such as

227
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,660
Epstein-Barr which everybody has

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,580
we've got to remember everybody's got

229
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,459
the ebv's in their livers they got the

230
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,140
ebvs in their body they got the ebvs in

231
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,180
their system

232
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,880
a low-grade viral infection such as

233
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,860
Epstein-Barr can worsen brain fog adding

234
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,260
to the depersonalization so you can have

235
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,600
a low-grade viral infection

236
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,980
causing a symptom like brain fog and a

237
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,200
mild fatigue

238
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,779
coupled with

239
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,940
a variety of toxic heavy metals sitting

240
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,779
closer to the emotional centers of the

241
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,459
brain

242
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,560
and that's where the confusion lies

243
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,080
that's why it's critical to know the

244
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,899
information so you don't get tricked our

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,080
fooled or do so you don't get owned by

246
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,760
the system you you get free because you

247
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,140
become the expert and you say oh my God

248
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,480
how come research and science doesn't

249
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,880
know this does it know that you can have

250
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,820
multiple things happening low-grade

251
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,040
viral infection from EBV plus toxic

252
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,540
heavy metals by the emotional centers of

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,560
the brain and the different variables

254
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,560
all included

255
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,860
depersonalization can also happen

256
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,740
without emotional injury without

257
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,019
emotional trauma you can go through life

258
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,420
everything's good you're taken care of

259
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,580
you have support life is great

260
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,500
and still get depersonalization I talk

261
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,060
about that in here so it could be

262
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,279
someone without these other variables

263
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:21,200
and still get the condition learn about

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,200
it here I'll see you guys next time
