[43.00 - 46.08] difficult world when it comes down to
[44.16 - 47.96] chronic illness science and research is
[46.08 - 49.76] behind the times with chronic illness
[47.96 - 51.68] it's ahead of the times with so many
[49.76 - 53.16] awesome things it really is and
[51.68 - 55.08] including in medicine life-saving
[53.16 - 57.76] medicine without a doubt we're we're way
[55.08 - 60.48] ahead to where we were before but not in
[57.76 - 62.12] chronic illness not in chronic
[60.48 - 64.88] illness and Today's Show is about
[62.12 - 67.12] sluggish liver sluggish liver is a term
[64.88 - 69.12] that I've actually been using all these
[67.12 - 71.08] decades in and and working with people
[69.12 - 73.04] and everything sluggish liver is is
[71.08 - 75.52] that's that's where it's derived from
[73.04 - 77.36] this isn't fatty liver this isn't fatty
[75.52 - 78.84] liver this is sluggish liver someone
[77.36 - 81.76] said to me wait a minute never heard
[78.84 - 83.16] sluggish liver yeah because that that's
[81.76 - 84.92] that's the thing that I've been actually
[83.16 - 86.28] trying to teach people along the way so
[84.92 - 87.64] they know what's going on so you can
[86.28 - 89.36] kind of see the symptoms and everything
[87.64 - 90.88] and what's scary about sluggish liver
[89.36 - 93.72] about the liver being stagnant and
[90.88 - 95.16] sluggish what's spooky about that well
[93.72 - 96.64] you can get all kinds of different
[95.16 - 98.24] things all kinds of different illnesses
[96.64 - 100.64] and diseases and everything else and
[98.24 - 102.20] that's what we have to avoid our liver
[100.64 - 104.52] gets filled up with all kinds of toxins
[102.20 - 107.60] and poisons I'm going to go into it but
[104.52 - 109.20] I'm also going to show you the signs so
[107.60 - 110.72] you actually know what they are so you
[109.20 - 112.24] could be like oh my God I have to start
[110.72 - 114.44] taking care of my liver this is really
[112.24 - 117.04] an important show this is one of those
[114.44 - 119.20] shows where look if you're dealing with
[117.04 - 121.00] a condition now this will help you if
[119.20 - 123.36] you're not deal dealing with a condition
[121.00 - 125.52] this will help you if you're you know if
[123.36 - 127.40] you have a symptom or two this is going
[125.52 - 129.04] to help everything is going to help when
[127.40 - 131.16] it comes down to the liver with getting
[129.04 - 132.80] rid of a sluggish liver and and a
[131.16 - 135.08] sluggish liver isn't just about having
[132.80 - 136.80] weight gain you can have no weight
[135.08 - 138.76] coming on and have a sluggish liver I'm
[136.80 - 140.72] going to talk about this this is really
[138.76 - 142.92] an important episode without a doubt so
[140.72 - 144.80] I want you to be uh I want you to be
[142.92 - 147.36] comfortable get some herbal tea whatever
[144.80 - 150.04] you need sit back and and just you know
[147.36 - 152.16] let me let me throw it all at you so you
[150.04 - 154.20] can say okay okay and you could sit back
[152.16 - 157.04] and everything else let me do the work
[154.20 - 160.24] here let me do the work and then you sit
[157.04 - 161.76] back relax and uh let's go for the ride
[160.24 - 163.88] fasten your seat belts though cuz this
[161.76 - 166.80] isn't going to be a pretty this isn't
[163.88 - 168.96] going to be a pretty show this isn't
[166.80 - 170.80] going to be a pretty one you know the
[168.96 - 172.92] funny thing is the symptoms and
[170.80 - 176.88] conditions that result from a
[172.92 - 179.96] compromised liver aren't only the ones
[176.88 - 181.80] you would expect not the ones you would
[179.96 - 184.12] expect so you have to always know that
[181.80 - 187.32] the liver gives us all these different
[184.12 - 190.12] symptoms that we're not aware of and
[187.32 - 191.72] conditions that we're not aware of so we
[190.12 - 196.20] have to think about that for a minute
[191.72 - 200.04] okay so contrary to popular belief Xmen
[196.20 - 201.48] sasis isn't a a like autoimmune
[200.04 - 203.56] condition where the body's attacking
[201.48 - 206.48] itself that's not what causes ecos
[203.56 - 210.04] psoriasis see that's just one condition
[206.48 - 212.68] that is a liver problem see the liver is
[210.04 - 214.56] why someone has examon psoriasis it's
[212.68 - 216.48] their liver and it's not their body
[214.56 - 220.08] attacking the liver their body is not
[216.48 - 223.04] attacking the liver at all but that is
[220.08 - 225.04] one prime example that research and
[223.04 - 227.76] science has no idea about has no idea
[225.04 - 230.12] that xasis is literally just a liver
[227.76 - 232.56] problem and with Xmen psoriasis it's
[230.12 - 235.64] copper in the liver coupled with a viral
[232.56 - 237.16] um a viral load so a lowgrade chronic
[235.64 - 239.36] viral infection that sits in the liver
[237.16 - 241.16] for for could be for decades starting
[239.36 - 242.56] from childhood sitting in the liver and
[241.16 - 243.96] what it does it feeds off a copper
[242.56 - 246.20] releases a
[243.96 - 247.88] dermatoxin um that dermatoxin floats to
[246.20 - 250.60] the surface of the skin creates XML or
[247.88 - 253.80] psoriasis or rosacea and so forth so
[250.60 - 257.48] that's that one but see you know science
[253.80 - 259.40] of research isn't there yet so example
[257.48 - 262.28] so here's the deal like an overloaded
[259.40 - 264.60] liver can cause acne too nobody knows
[262.28 - 266.12] that part science and research is still
[264.60 - 267.96] kind of hung up on the whole hormone
[266.12 - 270.36] thing like it must be hormonal something
[267.96 - 273.04] must be going on but that's not it at
[270.36 - 275.00] all sure you can get acne breakouts
[273.04 - 277.00] during hormonal period times in your
[275.00 - 278.80] life whether it's puberty or menstration
[277.00 - 281.52] or anything like that
[278.80 - 283.08] because because the immune system drops
[281.52 - 286.40] during anything anything happening
[283.08 - 288.52] hormonally including a bad experience
[286.40 - 289.96] including high stress where your
[288.52 - 291.44] adrenals are pumping and all those
[289.96 - 293.24] hormones are flooding through your body
[291.44 - 295.40] from your adrenal glands you can then
[293.24 - 297.52] get acne a week later nobody knows you
[295.40 - 299.24] can't connect the dots that happens all
[297.52 - 301.44] the time so it's all about the IM immune
[299.24 - 304.44] system from dropping because of
[301.44 - 306.16] experiences that are hormonal that lower
[304.44 - 308.64] the immune system research and science
[306.16 - 311.76] doesn't know that part so but a sluggish
[308.64 - 314.08] liver leads to acne so that's a whole
[311.76 - 316.68] another thing you know and and and just
[314.08 - 318.60] I could go on and on and on and I think
[316.68 - 320.52] I will and I think I will we're told
[318.60 - 323.28] it's only hormonal like I said for skin
[320.52 - 326.04] related but that's not true it's a sign
[323.28 - 329.24] that that that basically there the the
[326.04 - 331.28] liver is under some type of duress some
[329.24 - 333.12] type of duress and with with acne when
[331.28 - 335.28] the immune system lowers strep which
[333.12 - 336.84] sits inside the liver and sits inside
[335.28 - 338.88] the lymphatic vessels and everywhere
[336.84 - 340.76] else in the body can kind of rise up and
[338.88 - 342.40] strep causes what you know causes the
[340.76 - 343.64] body to build up sebum oil and then you
[342.40 - 345.12] got the acne and the whole bit and then
[343.64 - 347.00] you got the cystic acne which is Strep
[345.12 - 349.20] related that's why when doctors used
[347.00 - 351.08] antibiotics in the old days and a long
[349.20 - 353.68] time ago for the first acne cases they
[351.08 - 356.04] were just like whoa It's Working For A
[353.68 - 357.60] Minute exactly and then it created new
[356.04 - 359.76] antibiotics and new antibiotics and the
[357.60 - 361.44] strep gets resistant new antibiotics and
[359.76 - 363.80] hey you know keep people on antibiotics
[361.44 - 365.00] for years try to keep their strep down
[363.80 - 366.68] they don't know it's strep they don't
[365.00 - 369.28] know what's happening that's what I was
[366.68 - 372.16] saying this is Advanced information so
[369.28 - 373.76] you can be like armed so you can be
[372.16 - 375.84] protected so you can have armor so you
[373.76 - 379.08] can have your Shield so you can be an
[375.84 - 381.20] expert there's nothing better than being
[379.08 - 383.48] an expert there's nothing better than
[381.20 - 385.12] being an expert and that's what you are
[383.48 - 387.32] when you get all this information and
[385.12 - 389.96] that's it you can kind of you can hold
[387.32 - 391.80] that sword hold that Shield in the whole
[389.96 - 393.84] bit it's important to to protect
[391.80 - 395.76] yourself when it comes down to health
[393.84 - 398.64] being an expert in health is really
[395.76 - 401.44] important so so we're talking about this
[398.64 - 404.28] mystery high blood pressure mystery high
[401.44 - 406.60] blood pressure how about that one okay
[404.28 - 409.40] mystery high blood pressure means they
[406.60 - 411.88] they don't really see a big old clog
[409.40 - 413.84] somewhere they don't see a big old clog
[411.88 - 416.60] like in the artery like tons of plaque
[413.84 - 419.12] buildup and and you know and even people
[416.60 - 420.20] with plaque buildup and all that they
[419.12 - 422.52] don't have have to have high blood
[420.20 - 424.44] pressure at all and they don't see a
[422.52 - 426.36] heart problem a direct heart problem so
[424.44 - 427.68] they're thinking like you know hey wait
[426.36 - 429.28] well you got high blood pressure it's
[427.68 - 430.96] just probably genetic or it's just you
[429.28 - 432.48] know maybe your father had it maybe
[430.96 - 434.32] whatever and this is what happens or
[432.48 - 436.04] your you know your mom had it or
[434.32 - 439.16] whatever it is and so they go by things
[436.04 - 442.20] like that but unless they see a direct
[439.16 - 443.68] like clog somewhere you know that's some
[442.20 - 445.68] arteries that are really being clogged
[443.68 - 448.08] up and the passageways are getting more
[445.68 - 451.16] narrow for blood flow and then the blood
[448.08 - 452.68] pressure can go up because of that but
[451.16 - 454.16] even with that it doesn't mean blood
[452.68 - 455.96] pressure is up with a lot of people that
[454.16 - 458.20] have artery and plaques and plaque
[455.96 - 460.92] inside their their you know inside the
[458.20 - 463.76] arteries arterial plaque so what happens
[460.92 - 464.84] is that it's the liver that has
[463.76 - 467.72] everything to do with high blood
[464.84 - 470.48] pressure sluggish liver sluggish
[467.72 - 472.80] stagnant liver mystery heart
[470.48 - 475.72] palpitations once again sluggish
[472.80 - 478.20] stagnant liver but in that case that
[475.72 - 480.04] case it has a lot to do with something
[478.20 - 481.80] viral inside the liver creating a
[480.04 - 483.56] jelly-like substance that's the Epstein
[481.80 - 485.44] bar virus that jelly-like substance gets
[483.56 - 487.48] sucked out of the liver pushed up the
[485.44 - 490.16] highway right up to the heart collects
[487.48 - 493.60] in the valves creates heart palpitations
[490.16 - 495.32] rhythmia ectopic heartbeat and so forth
[493.60 - 498.04] so science of research doesn't know any
[495.32 - 499.80] of that either and at all including the
[498.04 - 501.56] high blood pressure thing I just said
[499.80 - 502.96] you medical communities are unaware of
[501.56 - 505.00] any of this so you're getting really
[502.96 - 506.76] Advanced information out of Liver Rescue
[505.00 - 509.56] right here if you don't have a copy of
[506.76 - 511.76] Liver Rescue you should get a copy of a
[509.56 - 513.32] rescue if you can't afford a copy go to
[511.76 - 514.88] the library I see it all the time I know
[513.32 - 517.12] I sound like a broken record but that's
[514.88 - 519.44] how bad I want you to have the book I
[517.12 - 521.80] want you to be able to help yourself so
[519.44 - 523.12] we have um and in a book if you don't
[521.80 - 525.88] have I don't know what it is if you can
[523.12 - 527.76] get I $15 $20 but if you can get a book
[525.88 - 530.28] get a book if you can whatever you can
[527.76 - 533.72] do or at the library so the har
[530.28 - 535.32] reputations Diabetes Type 2 diabetes see
[533.72 - 536.88] what happens is science and research
[535.32 - 539.36] thinks type two diabetes has everything
[536.88 - 541.08] to do with nothing but sugar consumption
[539.36 - 542.84] and you know insulin resistance from
[541.08 - 546.12] sugar consumption they're thinking you
[542.84 - 547.20] know pancreas gets weak A1C goes up got
[546.12 - 550.44] type 2
[547.20 - 553.20] diabetes um everything's wrong again
[550.44 - 555.20] wrong wrong wrong what happens is it has
[553.20 - 557.44] everything to do with the liver you
[555.20 - 558.72] change your diet the liver gets better
[557.44 - 560.28] okay you start eating better the liver
[558.72 - 562.72] starts getting better your numbers go
[560.28 - 564.40] down that's how it works if you keep on
[562.72 - 567.88] eating all this bad food all this bad
[564.40 - 570.08] food that's filled with fat and sugar
[567.88 - 571.64] combined toiv gets burdened the liver
[570.08 - 573.12] gets burdened the liver gets burdened
[571.64 - 574.84] gets sluggish sluggish sluggish type two
[573.12 - 576.28] diabetes is a sluggish liver you get
[574.84 - 579.12] your liver a little bit better you you
[576.28 - 581.40] lose the type two diabetes or the or the
[579.12 - 585.60] the blood sugar issues that's sluggish
[581.40 - 587.96] liver right there so think about that
[585.60 - 589.44] and I mean I'm I'm going through all
[587.96 - 591.52] these different conditions right here
[589.44 - 593.68] which is kind of cool you know I didn't
[591.52 - 594.88] expect that on the show I didn't expect
[593.68 - 596.04] it I was going to go about I was going
[594.88 - 597.56] to talk about other things about the
[596.04 - 599.64] liver being sluggish how it works and
[597.56 - 601.96] everything but it's I guess it's good to
[599.64 - 604.84] actually connect the dots right here of
[601.96 - 607.24] the conditions that sluggish liver
[604.84 - 608.84] brings I think that that's the best way
[607.24 - 610.24] to do it I mean I just realized it just
[608.84 - 612.20] now I was just going to give you this
[610.24 - 613.48] whole bunch of stuff about sluggish
[612.20 - 615.52] liver which we're going to do which
[613.48 - 619.44] we're still going to do but this is
[615.52 - 621.24] really cool um I'm excited about this so
[619.44 - 622.36] in Liver Rescue I talk all about this I
[621.24 - 623.72] have whole section in the book on
[622.36 - 625.08] sluggish liver it's important to know
[623.72 - 626.84] all this stuff and I can't scratch the
[625.08 - 629.44] surface of what Liver Rescue has in this
[626.84 - 630.76] radio show I I know some some of you are
[629.44 - 631.96] probably listen to radio show well I
[630.76 - 634.52] don't need to get the book I got his
[631.96 - 637.32] radio shows actually actually the book
[634.52 - 639.76] is massive and the the word count is
[637.32 - 641.92] huge and I can't even scratch a surface
[639.76 - 645.24] it's not even possible but this is fun
[641.92 - 647.64] so we got um we got the type 2 diabetes
[645.24 - 649.40] so what happens with diabetes is and
[647.64 - 650.40] I'll give you the quick rendition of it
[649.40 - 652.80] because we'll probably do another
[650.40 - 655.84] diabetes show down the road the quick
[652.80 - 658.72] rendition is with type 2 diabetes is the
[655.84 - 661.92] liver gets sluggish toxic and it's from
[658.72 - 663.68] the high fat diet all high fat diet it
[661.92 - 667.32] just so happens people usually eat a lot
[663.68 - 668.72] of bad sugar with their High fats so
[667.32 - 672.16] what does that mean bad sugar where your
[668.72 - 674.24] hide fats it's ice cream it's fat sugar
[672.16 - 677.84] that's just an example right there you
[674.24 - 680.80] know milk lactose fat that's milk I mean
[677.84 - 683.04] it's you know cheese fat sugar that's
[680.80 - 685.88] that's what that is cheese you have
[683.04 - 687.68] cheese to just you have fat and sugar
[685.88 - 689.96] what that does is it creates a real
[687.68 - 691.80] sluggish liver creates a real sluggish
[689.96 - 694.08] liver it puts lots of fat in the
[691.80 - 696.12] bloodstream puts poor quality sugars in
[694.08 - 699.60] the bloodstream at the same
[696.12 - 702.72] time and but but really you can do that
[699.60 - 704.84] you can put you can put ice cream into
[702.72 - 707.36] people and young people and they're not
[704.84 - 709.56] getting type 2 diabetes they're not
[707.36 - 712.84] getting insulin resistance because their
[709.56 - 715.24] liver isn't sluggish yet you see how it
[712.84 - 716.56] goes your liver starts getting sluggish
[715.24 - 718.12] from all the junk in it from all the
[716.56 - 719.76] garbage in it from high fat diet for
[718.12 - 721.52] many years
[719.76 - 723.92] you know a teenager is not on a high fat
[721.52 - 725.20] diet for many years but when you start
[723.92 - 726.96] getting in your 20s and you're getting
[725.20 - 728.76] in your 30s you're still doing high fat
[726.96 - 730.32] diets and now we're told to eat high fat
[728.76 - 732.08] diets high protein high fat diets now
[730.32 - 734.28] but minus the sugar as if that's the
[732.08 - 736.00] answer if that's actually the answer
[734.28 - 737.76] which it's not it's not in Liver Rescue
[736.00 - 739.32] I explain the whole thing it's not the
[737.76 - 740.80] answer I have a whole section of the
[739.32 - 743.16] book talking about the high fat Trend
[740.80 - 745.12] and where it came from how it started
[743.16 - 747.04] and why it's not right and what's right
[745.12 - 748.56] and what isn't what's wrong what's not
[747.04 - 749.80] whatever just so you got the right
[748.56 - 751.52] information
[749.80 - 753.60] just so you don't waste time I mean I
[751.52 - 755.32] don't know life is precious and when I
[753.60 - 759.16] think about it when I think about how
[755.32 - 761.08] precious life is and um every day is
[759.16 - 763.88] precious every hour is precious I mean
[761.08 - 767.88] come on face it I mean right and when I
[763.88 - 770.24] think about wasting time on information
[767.88 - 772.72] that that is isn't correct or doesn't
[770.24 - 774.40] get you anywhere or you think it is but
[772.72 - 776.00] in the end it tricks you and it's like
[774.40 - 777.32] falls through your hand like sand and
[776.00 - 780.04] then it doesn't get you anywhere down
[777.32 - 781.96] the road it's really disappointing
[780.04 - 784.28] because how much time was invested how
[781.96 - 787.08] much money is invested whatever it is
[784.28 - 788.56] it's really sad and and life here on
[787.08 - 790.24] Earth is precious we need every minute
[788.56 - 793.04] we can get so getting the real
[790.24 - 794.60] information is the key and the one thing
[793.04 - 796.32] you'll you'll you'll get if you're brand
[794.60 - 797.92] new to the show is like is okay is he
[796.32 - 799.44] selling something no I'm not selling
[797.92 - 801.32] anything is he selling something what's
[799.44 - 803.00] he selling is he selling a $5,000
[801.32 - 805.04] cleanse what's he doing what's his gig
[803.00 - 807.44] is he selling zillions of supplements no
[805.04 - 808.88] I'm not selling anything I'm not selling
[807.44 - 810.16] anything when I'm saying the
[808.88 - 811.76] information's correct and it's right
[810.16 - 813.48] information for you and everything else
[811.76 - 816.16] what you'll find there's no there's no
[813.48 - 818.12] marketing MLM marketing or you can buy
[816.16 - 820.68] into a cleanse or whatever it is and get
[818.12 - 822.24] you know I'm you know whatever it is
[820.68 - 824.36] whatever that people are doing out there
[822.24 - 825.88] now it's crazy it's like infomercials on
[824.36 - 829.00] every podcast they almost can't even
[825.88 - 830.96] stand it so when you're getting the
[829.00 - 832.68] right information it's key it can
[830.96 - 834.16] protect you from diabetes it can protect
[832.68 - 835.72] you from exom and psoriasis it can
[834.16 - 837.84] protect you from the from high blood
[835.72 - 840.84] pressure but more than that protect you
[837.84 - 843.56] from acne protect more than that it
[840.84 - 846.04] doesn't waste your time it doesn't waste
[843.56 - 848.16] your time and that's the key right here
[846.04 - 849.44] so what happens is when somebody's
[848.16 - 850.88] younger and they're and they're not
[849.44 - 852.20] getting that kind of they're sluggish
[850.88 - 853.48] they're not getting that sluggish liver
[852.20 - 855.24] yet and let me tell you something young
[853.48 - 856.48] people get sluggish liver too and
[855.24 - 857.96] they're not getting that sluggish so
[856.48 - 860.48] many are are younger they're not getting
[857.96 - 863.24] the sluggish liver quite yet what
[860.48 - 865.16] happens right there is they're not going
[863.24 - 866.60] to show signs of A1C Rising they're not
[865.16 - 867.68] going to show signs of diabetes 2
[866.60 - 869.88] they're not going to show signs of any
[867.68 - 871.88] of that they might see you might see
[869.88 - 874.16] some hypoglycemia I've seen a lot of
[871.88 - 877.40] teenagers with hypoglycemia without a
[874.16 - 880.04] doubt without a doubt not hyper so much
[877.40 - 881.80] but always hypo so that's a sluggish
[880.04 - 884.60] liver starting right there all on its
[881.80 - 887.28] own but the point is it's not you know
[884.60 - 889.04] not not not the most normal thing it's
[887.28 - 890.20] just yeah there there are teenagers
[889.04 - 892.76] going through that and then people in
[890.20 - 894.24] their 20s go through it more people in
[892.76 - 896.60] the 30s go through it even more sluggish
[894.24 - 898.28] liver gets worse and worse and worse you
[896.60 - 900.08] got the fat and the sugar combinations
[898.28 - 901.64] you fat and sugar combinations fin liver
[900.08 - 903.20] is just like oh my God I can't take this
[901.64 - 905.56] anymore I can't handle this anymore the
[903.20 - 907.40] liver can think I can think it can
[905.56 - 909.32] function it has over 2,000 chemical
[907.40 - 912.32] functions undiscovered by research and
[909.32 - 916.04] Science and in those 2,000 chemical
[912.32 - 919.12] functions it it it's it's at a place
[916.04 - 921.00] it's at a place where it you know it has
[919.12 - 922.32] to think for you it actually has to
[921.00 - 923.96] think for you if it doesn't think for
[922.32 - 926.12] you it can't protect you it can't do the
[923.96 - 928.08] best it can to give you that longer life
[926.12 - 929.40] and we just trash our livers and that's
[928.08 - 932.80] the whole thing
[929.40 - 934.92] we do trash or livers I mean it's it's
[932.80 - 937.48] that's how it works here do we do it on
[934.92 - 940.04] purpose I I don't know if anybody really
[937.48 - 942.00] does it on purpose even if someone
[940.04 - 944.44] drinks I don't know if they're trashing
[942.00 - 947.04] the liver on purpose even if someone
[944.44 - 949.04] drinks so it's just a really really
[947.04 - 952.28] strange situation on that whole thing
[949.04 - 954.04] but so but basically we do trash your
[952.28 - 957.00] livers maybe it's by default maybe it's
[954.04 - 959.16] by just being here but either way so
[957.00 - 961.00] that sluggish sluggish liver what
[959.16 - 961.92] happens is it starts to get so clogged
[961.00 - 965.28] up with
[961.92 - 968.76] fat and it loses its glucose
[965.28 - 970.76] reserves on top of that that's that's
[968.76 - 972.36] what happens then the pancreas starts to
[970.76 - 974.04] give away a little bit starts to give
[972.36 - 976.76] away a little bit weaken a little bit
[974.04 - 978.48] too it's really the sluggish liver that
[976.76 - 979.92] gets you into the diabetes the type 2
[978.48 - 982.96] diabetes but what happens is someone
[979.92 - 984.28] starts exercising and they start shaking
[982.96 - 986.72] up their liver and they start changing
[984.28 - 989.00] their diet and they start taking out the
[986.72 - 990.60] sugar and they still keep their high fat
[989.00 - 992.64] diet but they take out the sugar their
[990.60 - 993.72] A1C goes down and the doctor's like look
[992.64 - 995.08] you're already getting better but
[993.72 - 996.68] doesn't mean your liver's not sluggish
[995.08 - 998.12] as heck and diabetes can't come back in
[996.68 - 1000.20] the drop of a hat when you eat a little
[998.12 - 1003.44] sugar what you really need to do is drop
[1000.20 - 1004.84] the fat and bring healthy carbohydrates
[1003.44 - 1005.92] in healthy sugars and that's how you
[1004.84 - 1007.56] beat it and that's how you get rid of
[1005.92 - 1010.00] your sluggish liver but that's just
[1007.56 - 1012.56] diabetes that's was just a quick a quick
[1010.00 - 1014.32] rendition of that real quick you know
[1012.56 - 1015.92] another thing right here Seasonal
[1014.32 - 1019.32] effective disorder
[1015.92 - 1021.80] sad so Seasonal effective disorder
[1019.32 - 1024.16] that's from a sluggish liver it's
[1021.80 - 1026.00] amazing you know the in the 1980s early
[1024.16 - 1028.08] 1980s Seasonal effective disorder a
[1026.00 - 1030.52] whole bunch of experts got together and
[1028.08 - 1032.56] they crowned they got their like Crown
[1030.52 - 1034.24] Glory they got their names behind
[1032.56 - 1036.88] Seasonal effective disorder as if they
[1034.24 - 1038.56] discovered something Seasonal effective
[1036.88 - 1041.44] sorder I have a whole chapter in here
[1038.56 - 1044.72] it's it's actually a joke it's like it's
[1041.44 - 1047.40] it's it's not about the
[1044.72 - 1051.20] seasons it's about how sick your liver
[1047.40 - 1053.00] is and yeah for a lot of people and you
[1051.20 - 1054.28] know in the summertime it you know their
[1053.00 - 1055.44] liver does a little better you know why
[1054.28 - 1056.84] they're walking a little bit more
[1055.44 - 1058.28] they're eating a little bit better maybe
[1056.84 - 1060.40] they ate a couple of pieces of fresh
[1058.28 - 1062.36] fruit maybe they had some
[1060.40 - 1064.36] berries um yeah they're getting a little
[1062.36 - 1066.00] sun which helps your liver and talk
[1064.36 - 1068.40] about that all the time helps your liver
[1066.00 - 1070.20] and Liver Rescue I talk about it I mean
[1068.40 - 1071.92] they get a little more sun but they're
[1070.20 - 1072.88] helping their liver and then what about
[1071.92 - 1074.72] all those people that don't have
[1072.88 - 1076.80] Seasonal effective disorder their liver
[1074.72 - 1079.28] is not as bad yet so they kind of tend
[1076.80 - 1081.28] to do okay in the winter
[1079.28 - 1084.00] but everybody you know everybody in the
[1081.28 - 1086.04] winter months you know does doesn't do
[1084.00 - 1087.68] that great unless they're you know
[1086.04 - 1088.76] exercising and they're in the gyms and
[1087.68 - 1089.88] everything else and they're taking care
[1088.76 - 1091.20] of the liver a little bit and they're
[1089.88 - 1093.04] eating still a little bit better and
[1091.20 - 1094.84] then they can kind of but seasonal
[1093.04 - 1097.44] effectives order like it was a big
[1094.84 - 1099.08] Discovery unbelievable I think it's a
[1097.44 - 1100.48] group of I don't know a group of doctors
[1099.08 - 1102.16] or group of experts have their name on
[1100.48 - 1106.16] seasonal effectiv disorder from back in
[1102.16 - 1108.04] the 80s it's like oh my God yawn my God
[1106.16 - 1110.20] because it's it's like when you think
[1108.04 - 1111.92] about it you can't even scratch the
[1110.20 - 1113.32] surface to what it really is or even get
[1111.92 - 1114.92] to it not to men you get all the people
[1113.32 - 1116.80] with chronic illness meaning a chronic
[1114.92 - 1119.04] fatigue syndrome where it gets worse in
[1116.80 - 1120.56] the winter or it even gets worse in the
[1119.04 - 1121.72] summer because their nerves are inflamed
[1120.56 - 1123.92] and that's the whole thing seasonal
[1121.72 - 1126.20] effect disorder went to Summertime
[1123.92 - 1128.56] because it was getting so kind of like
[1126.20 - 1129.76] shady where it wasn't the winter there
[1128.56 - 1131.44] all these people they're exhibiting
[1129.76 - 1132.60] symptoms and it's summertime too and
[1131.44 - 1134.68] they're exhibiting symptoms in the
[1132.60 - 1137.28] spring and exhibiting symptoms in the
[1134.68 - 1139.48] fall it's kind of was ridiculous what
[1137.28 - 1141.24] was happening because do people have
[1139.48 - 1142.92] viruses in their liver they got chronic
[1141.24 - 1144.24] illness they got Epstein bar inside
[1142.92 - 1145.68] their liver they got chronic fatigue
[1144.24 - 1148.04] syndrome on and off they got all kinds
[1145.68 - 1149.72] of different things going on and it all
[1148.04 - 1151.36] reflects on you know how their nerves
[1149.72 - 1152.88] feel and if they can't handle the heat
[1151.36 - 1154.72] they swell up with the humidity and in
[1152.88 - 1157.44] the winter time they hurt and they're
[1154.72 - 1159.56] sore and they're achy and is it sad no
[1157.44 - 1161.44] it's so many other
[1159.56 - 1164.16] things and that's the joke about
[1161.44 - 1165.84] Seasonal effective disorder but if you
[1164.16 - 1167.20] take seasonal effect disorder you know
[1165.84 - 1168.80] serious for what it you know for the
[1167.20 - 1170.96] name or whatever it is you look at it's
[1168.80 - 1172.60] a liver problem and it's all these other
[1170.96 - 1174.80] problems with the liver it's all these
[1172.60 - 1178.40] other problems with the liver so can set
[1174.80 - 1180.68] you up dark circles under the eyes
[1178.40 - 1182.92] that's a sluggish liver because the
[1180.68 - 1185.08] blood's getting filled with so many
[1182.92 - 1186.72] toxins so the blood's getting filled
[1185.08 - 1189.36] with so many toxins unless you haven't
[1186.72 - 1191.76] slept unless you don't
[1189.36 - 1193.80] sleep I'll get a few dark circles under
[1191.76 - 1196.40] my I'll get a few days of it without a
[1193.80 - 1198.04] doubt because I'm working on the books
[1196.40 - 1199.68] and I don't want to stop sometimes you
[1198.04 - 1201.16] get on a roll and you just you just
[1199.68 - 1202.60] don't want to stop and spirit's giving
[1201.16 - 1204.20] you the information you don't want to
[1202.60 - 1206.72] stop you just don't want to say oh no I
[1204.20 - 1208.76] I I can't do this right now you just
[1206.72 - 1210.40] want to just take that medical
[1208.76 - 1212.04] information from Spirit you want to put
[1210.40 - 1213.64] it in you want to put it in you want to
[1212.04 - 1215.64] write it write it write and so if that
[1213.64 - 1217.60] means three days of being up mostly and
[1215.64 - 1220.68] sleeping on and off on the
[1217.60 - 1222.12] couch for a few hours or whatever it is
[1220.68 - 1223.64] yeah I'll get some dark circles but if
[1222.12 - 1224.68] you have dark circles and you're getting
[1223.64 - 1227.72] all the
[1224.68 - 1229.12] sleep you're getting all the sleep I
[1227.72 - 1230.80] mean you're getting 8 hours a night 7
[1229.12 - 1231.88] hours a night whatever 6 hours a night
[1230.80 - 1234.12] you're getting your sleep you got some
[1231.88 - 1236.24] dark circles that's the sluggish liver
[1234.12 - 1239.04] and those are toxins in the blood blood
[1236.24 - 1241.28] toxins floating around floating around
[1239.04 - 1244.76] those blood toxins are floating around
[1241.28 - 1246.12] and they surface to this thin skin the
[1244.76 - 1248.36] under your eyes you got your thinnest
[1246.12 - 1251.08] skin that's your thinnest skin under
[1248.36 - 1253.04] your eyes I don't I mean the under your
[1251.08 - 1256.16] armpits and under your eyes it's your
[1253.04 - 1258.32] thinnest skin especially under the eyes
[1256.16 - 1259.96] and so you'll see you know you see the
[1258.32 - 1262.60] dark circles because that's actually
[1259.96 - 1264.68] blood that's toxic
[1262.60 - 1266.12] blood that means you got a sluggish
[1264.68 - 1268.00] liver so that's how it works all these
[1266.12 - 1269.60] things and this you know something
[1268.00 - 1271.80] chronic
[1269.60 - 1273.52] dehydration you know chronic dehydration
[1271.80 - 1275.04] that's sluggish liver too people don't
[1273.52 - 1276.60] know they're chronically dehydrated they
[1275.04 - 1277.92] have no idea walking around chronically
[1276.60 - 1280.64] dehydrated it's unbelievable I just
[1277.92 - 1283.00] grabbed some water just now when I was
[1280.64 - 1284.68] when I was seeing that and saying that I
[1283.00 - 1287.04] just grabbed some water so I'm going to
[1284.68 - 1292.88] sip a little bit
[1287.04 - 1293.84] so H yeah it's good water very good so
[1292.88 - 1295.84] chronic

[1668.92 - 1673.56] know sluggish liver can lead to anything
[1671.96 - 1675.00] and what happens is what happens when
[1673.56 - 1676.84] the liver gets sluggish talk about that
[1675.00 - 1679.48] a little bit long longer before I go
[1676.84 - 1682.44] into more symptoms and conditions when
[1679.48 - 1687.08] the liver gets sluggish bio
[1682.44 - 1690.40] reserves break down they break down bio
[1687.08 - 1693.36] production weakens so bio production
[1690.40 - 1697.92] weakens why is bio so important you guys
[1693.36 - 1699.88] because it goes up into your gut goes up
[1697.92 - 1702.92] drops into your intestinal tract drops
[1699.88 - 1706.72] into your dadum drops down in there and
[1702.92 - 1709.84] it's there to disperse fats so it's
[1706.72 - 1712.64] there to disp disperse fats and if it
[1709.84 - 1714.88] doesn't disperse fats and we keep on
[1712.64 - 1716.28] bombarding our we keep on bombarding
[1714.88 - 1718.40] ourselves with these high fat diets
[1716.28 - 1720.80] including the healthy ones right now all
[1718.40 - 1722.52] that bile got to be produced wearing
[1720.80 - 1725.24] down the liver let's wear out the liver
[1722.52 - 1728.16] let's wear it wear it down so it's got
[1725.24 - 1730.28] to produce all its bio reserves and wear
[1728.16 - 1733.08] it down and break it down no one even
[1730.28 - 1735.52] talks about this stuff they don't even
[1733.08 - 1737.40] know not even the experts out there
[1735.52 - 1739.28] so-called experts you know I talked to
[1737.40 - 1740.88] some of those experts out there also
[1739.28 - 1742.40] writing books or whatever in health and
[1740.88 - 1745.96] everything and it's almost like I I
[1742.40 - 1748.32] can't talk to them because they they
[1745.96 - 1750.32] they they think you're talking Chinese
[1748.32 - 1752.40] when you talk about because they've
[1750.32 - 1754.36] never heard this information before they
[1752.40 - 1756.44] don't understand it they don't know that
[1754.36 - 1758.52] sluggish liver means bio reserves break
[1756.44 - 1760.80] down then then fats can't disperse from
[1758.52 - 1762.24] the high fat healthy diet and then the
[1760.80 - 1763.96] fats have to go somewhere and you know
[1762.24 - 1765.60] where it goes It goes on the lining of
[1763.96 - 1767.08] your intestinal tract grows ran it and
[1765.60 - 1769.52] feeds bacteria and they look at you they
[1767.08 - 1772.48] don't know they don't understand it's
[1769.52 - 1774.56] crazy they'll just say um well you know
[1772.48 - 1777.56] it's it's good to get rid of sugar and
[1774.56 - 1779.12] carbohydrates and um and healthy fats
[1777.56 - 1781.56] are good for you and they're good for
[1779.12 - 1783.44] your brain I that's where it stops it's
[1781.56 - 1785.64] actually unbelievable and then they say
[1783.44 - 1788.20] oh and stay away from grains you got to
[1785.64 - 1790.64] stay away from grains this is where it
[1788.20 - 1793.72] stops and I'm like oh my God am I am I
[1790.64 - 1795.12] talking to who am I talking to and
[1793.72 - 1797.08] they're just like well you need your
[1795.12 - 1799.28] protein and you got to get rid of your
[1797.08 - 1802.24] car carbohydrates and you got to get rid
[1799.28 - 1803.64] of your grains Okay okay you get to rid
[1802.24 - 1806.52] of gluten you got to worry about your
[1803.64 - 1808.68] lectins oh okay sure sure and you got to
[1806.52 - 1810.44] get rid of this and then you know and
[1808.68 - 1811.88] and this way you know you're you don't
[1810.44 - 1813.96] get the insulin resistance you get rid
[1811.88 - 1815.72] of your sugars out of your diet got to
[1813.96 - 1819.08] exercise it's almost like oh my God I
[1815.72 - 1821.00] just got stupider I just got stupider
[1819.08 - 1823.48] it's unbelievable to me
[1821.00 - 1826.52] really and you know and so the bottom
[1823.48 - 1828.84] line is what happens is if your bile
[1826.52 - 1830.96] breaks down because of the high fat diet
[1828.84 - 1832.40] you've been on for so many years meaning
[1830.96 - 1834.24] the poor fats you've been eating then
[1832.40 - 1836.96] the good fats whatever all the same to
[1834.24 - 1838.52] deliver eventually in the end you got to
[1836.96 - 1840.28] just lower them you don't just you can
[1838.52 - 1843.44] have fats and I'm not saying some fats
[1840.28 - 1845.60] aren't good for you that's not it but
[1843.44 - 1848.32] the liver it gets so beaten down so
[1845.60 - 1851.36] burdened down so then the bile can't
[1848.32 - 1852.88] actually break down any fats anymore
[1851.36 - 1855.12] what this happens is with your sluggish
[1852.88 - 1856.80] liver it also causes your stomach to
[1855.12 - 1858.24] lose its hydrochloric acid so that
[1856.80 - 1860.04] breaks down down so you can't break down
[1858.24 - 1862.24] your proteins good anymore and then you
[1860.04 - 1864.60] get gut rot and then you get diagnosed
[1862.24 - 1866.60] with sibo strep with strepa cacus that
[1864.60 - 1867.92] doctors don't even know either and I was
[1866.60 - 1869.24] talking to another expert and I was like
[1867.92 - 1871.00] well what what what kind of bacteria do
[1869.24 - 1872.24] you think's in there and they're like um
[1871.00 - 1875.04] it's just bacteria you know it's an
[1872.24 - 1877.32] overgrowth of bacteria I go what kind of
[1875.04 - 1879.92] bacteria I'm like well we don't know
[1877.32 - 1882.68] nobody knows what bacteria it is I go
[1879.92 - 1885.36] yeah of course it's strep that's what it
[1882.68 - 1888.20] is people are loaded with it from their
[1885.36 - 1889.72] mouth down to their butt and they loaded
[1888.20 - 1891.64] with it it's in their throat deep in
[1889.72 - 1893.64] their tonsils just sitting there it's
[1891.64 - 1896.04] coming out in acne
[1893.64 - 1898.08] everywhere yeah it's just chronic
[1896.04 - 1899.92] illness is not advanced in all I mean
[1898.08 - 1901.80] even if you talk to these you best
[1899.92 - 1903.72] functional people right now they just
[1901.80 - 1908.08] they kind of don't know instead they go
[1903.72 - 1909.84] into oh biome and bofilm and they'll go
[1908.08 - 1912.28] into you know that kind of thing go into
[1909.84 - 1914.88] lime and but but a cluel less though
[1912.28 - 1917.60] even about lime and it's hard so and I'm
[1914.88 - 1919.40] saying this only because if you if you
[1917.60 - 1922.24] want to be an expert you just you got to
[1919.40 - 1924.20] have the information you got to I mean I
[1922.24 - 1925.36] teach a lot of uh doctors too and I give
[1924.20 - 1926.60] them the information a lot of them are
[1925.36 - 1928.24] open to and they're like oh my God

[2025.20 - 2028.56] talk to these other trendy guys and it's
[2026.88 - 2030.24] like they're just like no no you got to
[2028.56 - 2032.56] keep the fats going you got to do the
[2030.24 - 2034.44] keto thing you got to just you know you
[2032.56 - 2036.36] got to avoid this avoid fruit you got to
[2034.44 - 2038.68] avoid all the fruit you can fruit's bad
[2036.36 - 2041.52] for you it's bad for the liver oh my God
[2038.68 - 2043.60] dear Lord I'm going to tell you now that
[2041.52 - 2045.24] that's what it's like out there it's
[2043.60 - 2047.36] that's exactly what it's like out there
[2045.24 - 2051.36] I am not exaggerating here and I'm not
[2047.36 - 2053.88] just I'm not yeah I'm not just saying
[2051.36 - 2055.20] this the whole bit so when it comes down
[2053.88 - 2057.68] to weight gain you got the sluggish
[2055.20 - 2060.04] liver the bio reserves break down so
[2057.68 - 2062.36] then your fats that are in your gut
[2060.04 - 2064.84] they're going in there that's why the
[2062.36 - 2067.32] weight is coming on so fast for so many
[2064.84 - 2068.76] people the bile can't break it down
[2067.32 - 2070.28] disperse it into the bloodstream and
[2068.76 - 2071.92] even if it does break it down disperse
[2070.28 - 2073.44] it into the bloodstream you still got
[2071.92 - 2074.64] all this fat in the bloodstream causing
[2073.44 - 2076.16] problems and going back up into the
[2074.64 - 2078.36] liver again that's a whole another
[2076.16 - 2079.84] problem but that's why you got to lower
[2078.36 - 2081.68] the fats in the diet for the for the
[2079.84 - 2084.04] sluggish liver but weight gain has a lot
[2081.68 - 2085.56] to do with that sure people lose weight
[2084.04 - 2087.32] when they go on like they when they go
[2085.56 - 2088.80] on they go off of all sugar they go on a
[2087.32 - 2090.56] radical change of their diet their body
[2088.80 - 2093.68] goes into shock they start exercising an
[2090.56 - 2095.20] hour a day and they start losing weight
[2093.68 - 2097.36] they're just eating you know some some
[2095.20 - 2099.84] protein and which is fat some protein
[2097.36 - 2101.20] and fat and some vegetables and they've
[2099.84 - 2103.36] changed everything they stopped eating
[2101.20 - 2104.84] the pizza their body goes in the shock
[2103.36 - 2106.04] but their liver still stays sluggish
[2104.84 - 2107.32] they still have a high-fat diet and
[2106.04 - 2108.88] they're still prone to heart attacks all
[2107.32 - 2111.12] the time I've seen people in the best
[2108.88 - 2115.20] shape with sluggish livers get heart
[2111.12 - 2117.68] attacks just heart attacks I I see it so
[2115.20 - 2120.84] I mean it's so unbelievable out there 39
[2117.68 - 2123.64] years old heart attacks 38 years old 42
[2120.84 - 2125.00] 44 whatever even exercising taking care
[2123.64 - 2126.60] of themselves I'm not talking about
[2125.00 - 2130.04] people that aren't taking care of
[2126.60 - 2132.16] themselves at all because what it is is
[2130.04 - 2134.08] you got this liver completely stagnant
[2132.16 - 2135.72] and sluggish no one's doing anything
[2134.08 - 2137.68] about the liver they're still on a diet
[2135.72 - 2139.56] that's not that's not helping the liver
[2137.68 - 2141.00] it's hurting the liver they've gotten
[2139.56 - 2142.96] weight off they've shifted things
[2141.00 - 2145.76] they're exercising but it's not enough
[2142.96 - 2148.40] we have to do more we have to do more if
[2145.76 - 2149.92] everybody thinks if anybody thinks
[2148.40 - 2153.44] they're just you know
[2149.92 - 2155.16] protected I mean you know no no you have
[2153.44 - 2158.20] to do things for yourself and the live a
[2155.16 - 2160.52] rescue that's what I talk about here so
[2158.20 - 2163.44] so with the weight gain all that F it's
[2160.52 - 2165.20] rants it sits on the Linings it's built
[2163.44 - 2166.76] up on the Linings of the intestinal
[2165.20 - 2169.44] tract the walls everywhere it gets
[2166.76 - 2170.76] rancid starts getting hard gets in the
[2169.44 - 2173.44] bloodstream too much it gets in the
[2170.76 - 2176.32] liver starts getting hard it gets in the
[2173.44 - 2178.36] liver sits there gets stagnant sluggish
[2176.32 - 2179.56] liver gets like that hydrochloric acid
[2178.36 - 2181.00] starts to break down in the stomach
[2179.56 - 2183.48] because the liver is breaking down the
[2181.00 - 2185.32] liver is weakening so HCL has to
[2183.48 - 2187.48] overproduce until it burns out so your
[2185.32 - 2189.32] gastric acid built Burns Out you start
[2187.48 - 2190.84] bloating you get weight gained and
[2189.32 - 2192.52] you're bloating the whole thing can go
[2190.84 - 2194.20] wrong and this is just I'm just
[2192.52 - 2195.32] scratching A A Touch of this I mean I
[2194.20 - 2197.88] could do a we're going to do a whole
[2195.32 - 2200.24] show on all this stuff chemical
[2197.88 - 2202.56] sensitivities chemical
[2200.24 - 2204.68] sensitivities that's one right there
[2202.56 - 2206.48] that's a sluggish liver a liver filled
[2204.68 - 2208.20] with a lot of poisons and toxins in the
[2206.48 - 2211.12] body reacting as these toxins are
[2208.20 - 2214.24] actually leaving the liver not only that
[2211.12 - 2217.44] they're in the liver stored and then you
[2214.24 - 2219.84] can't do any it can't store anymore more
[2217.44 - 2221.80] so then the chemicals anything anything
[2219.84 - 2224.20] you're exposed to you name it sits
[2221.80 - 2226.40] around in your system longer and longer
[2224.20 - 2227.84] and longer it can't even be vacuumed up
[2226.40 - 2230.16] into the
[2227.84 - 2232.88] liver I mean once again that's a real
[2230.16 - 2235.44] stagnant sluggish sluggish liver and
[2232.88 - 2237.44] I've seen people with a lot of weight on
[2235.44 - 2238.72] them with chemical sensitivities a lot
[2237.44 - 2240.64] of weight on them with the worst
[2238.72 - 2242.36] chemical sensitivities just really
[2240.64 - 2243.88] sluggish lymphatic system the liver
[2242.36 - 2245.60] sluggish a lot of weight on them the
[2243.88 - 2249.32] whole bit and I've seen people skinny as
[2245.60 - 2251.88] rails so skinny with chemical
[2249.32 - 2254.64] sensitivities and you still can have a
[2251.88 - 2257.60] dysfunctional fatty sluggish liver
[2254.64 - 2260.16] that's how how it works too you can have
[2257.60 - 2263.20] both things with different people
[2260.16 - 2266.28] easily easily with different people and
[2263.20 - 2268.44] for different reasons but that's how it
[2266.28 - 2270.20] works and then I've seen people they're
[2268.44 - 2272.92] really skinny but then they gain all the
[2270.20 - 2274.32] weight later so they chemical
[2272.92 - 2277.12] sensitivity is really skinny and they
[2274.32 - 2280.08] gain all this weight later after their
[2277.12 - 2282.08] adrenals start to really burn out but
[2280.08 - 2283.84] the adrenaline is actually keeping
[2282.08 - 2286.84] keeping their weight off I've seen
[2283.84 - 2290.28] people go 10 15 years really thin really
[2286.84 - 2292.72] thin not eating good not eating great
[2290.28 - 2295.28] really thin no carbohydrates I mean the
[2292.72 - 2298.00] healthy carbohydrates all on fat and
[2295.28 - 2299.72] protein thin in a bad way meaning like
[2298.00 - 2303.00] where where everybody's
[2299.72 - 2305.20] worried and then and then what happens
[2303.00 - 2306.96] is eventually catches up the adrenaline
[2305.20 - 2308.52] stops the whole thing what happens it's
[2306.96 - 2310.80] what when you're on the fat high fat
[2308.52 - 2311.92] diets when you're on the high fat diets
[2310.80 - 2313.12] whether we're talking about chemical
[2311.92 - 2314.60] sensitivities for a second but let's
[2313.12 - 2317.28] just go up when you're on these high fat
[2314.60 - 2318.64] diets it it it it burns the adrenals out
[2317.28 - 2322.28] because when you put fat when you eat
[2318.64 - 2324.24] too much fat over fat of any kind your
[2322.28 - 2326.36] adrenals have to flood the body with
[2324.24 - 2328.44] adrenaline to keep the blood as thin as
[2326.36 - 2331.32] possible it just wears the adrenals out
[2328.44 - 2333.20] too breaks it down totally kills them
[2331.32 - 2334.76] that's another example and I was
[2333.20 - 2337.84] explaining that to one guy and I was
[2334.76 - 2339.32] like look I said you have to understand
[2337.84 - 2340.84] the more fat you're putting in every day
[2339.32 - 2342.96] the more your adrenals have to keep on
[2340.84 - 2345.28] flooding and and you'll get a little
[2342.96 - 2346.56] high off of it but your adrenals are
[2345.28 - 2348.36] just going to be going and going and
[2346.56 - 2350.96] going how long can that last before all
[2348.36 - 2353.36] this weight comes back on before all
[2350.96 - 2354.08] this weight comes back on cuz that's
[2353.36 - 2356.28] what
[2354.08 - 2357.88] happens I was talking to a couple of you
[2356.28 - 2359.80] know trendy experts that got like books
[2357.88 - 2361.24] out and stuff and they're like yeah but
[2359.80 - 2363.48] and and I realized they they haven't
[2361.24 - 2366.56] been really doing it that long they
[2363.48 - 2368.52] might be doctors but they were doctors
[2366.56 - 2370.52] different field of medicine and they
[2368.52 - 2373.88] were doing conventional medicine and
[2370.52 - 2376.52] they decided to go alternative you know
[2373.88 - 2379.56] in The Last 5 Years so they don't even
[2376.52 - 2382.80] have a track record of seeing people
[2379.56 - 2384.16] sick for 20 30 years and heal for 2030
[2382.80 - 2385.32] years and going through all the
[2384.16 - 2386.60] different things and that's another
[2385.32 - 2388.92] thing I'm seeing now but they put out
[2386.60 - 2391.12] all this data and everybody bites it's
[2388.92 - 2393.16] amazing it's amazing and I'm saying this
[2391.12 - 2394.52] because you got to protect yourself and
[2393.16 - 2396.56] not be afraid of fruit you got to
[2394.52 - 2397.88] protect yourself and lower your fats I
[2396.56 - 2400.12] can teach you how to do it we'll do it
[2397.88 - 2403.32] in every show we it's it's doable you
[2400.12 - 2405.04] can do it so chemical sensitivities
[2403.32 - 2407.28] that's the blood being toxic with a lot
[2405.04 - 2408.72] of different poisons but also it means
[2407.28 - 2410.80] you're viral so with chemical
[2408.72 - 2412.40] sensitivities you have to be viral there
[2410.80 - 2413.88] has to be a virus inside the liver
[2412.40 - 2416.24] feeding off of all kinds of different
[2413.88 - 2418.84] poisons and releasing different
[2416.24 - 2421.20] varieties of toxins not just dermat
[2418.84 - 2422.60] toxins and and and uh neurotoxins that
[2421.20 - 2425.40] these viruses are
[2422.60 - 2427.72] releasing including bacteria but
[2425.40 - 2429.72] releasing other forms of toxins the body
[2427.72 - 2432.80] gets allergic to and sensitive to so
[2429.72 - 2434.52] this way you become hyper sensitive to
[2432.80 - 2436.48] whatever exposure out there because you
[2434.52 - 2438.52] have exposure internally that's all
[2436.48 - 2440.20] sluggish liver begin with it's viral
[2438.52 - 2442.36] sluggish liver but it's sluggish liver
[2440.20 - 2446.72] but it's viral sluggish
[2442.36 - 2450.80] liver I mean we can go we can go on here
[2446.72 - 2453.04] and on bloating low hydrochloric acid
[2450.80 - 2455.72] because of a sluggish liver low gastric
[2453.04 - 2457.44] acid because of a sluggish liver low bio
[2455.72 - 2459.68] reserves it just just talked about that
[2457.44 - 2462.80] that's bloating that means the liver got
[2459.68 - 2465.32] sluggish a long time ago and you can do
[2462.80 - 2470.28] something about it we can fix all this
[2465.32 - 2471.92] we can fix all of this so you know if
[2470.28 - 2473.28] anybody's just you know cluing on to the
[2471.92 - 2474.80] show or just got on to the show I'm
[2473.28 - 2476.68] talking about Liver Rescue I'm talking
[2474.80 - 2478.04] about rescuing our liver sluggish liver
[2476.68 - 2480.60] is what I'm talking about it's very
[2478.04 - 2482.28] important constipation once again
[2480.60 - 2484.04] sluggish liver filled the bacteria
[2482.28 - 2485.84] though constipation has a lot to do with
[2484.04 - 2487.80] bacteria sometimes viruses inside the
[2485.84 - 2489.68] liver
[2487.80 - 2491.24] a lot of toxins and poisons is another
[2489.68 - 2493.44] thing
[2491.24 - 2495.36] so it's amazing and I got to tell you
[2493.44 - 2498.16] something it's completely unknown that
[2495.36 - 2500.44] these and more originate at the liver so
[2498.16 - 2503.20] it's completely unknown that these
[2500.44 - 2505.48] symptoms and conditions and more a lot
[2503.20 - 2508.76] more that I even that I talk about in
[2505.48 - 2511.48] this book too are related to the
[2508.76 - 2513.64] liver and that's how it
[2511.48 - 2516.20] works that's how it works it's just
[2513.64 - 2517.92] incredible how it works so it's not just
[2516.20 - 2519.68] sluggish liver I say or anything like
[2517.92 - 2522.76] that I say stagnant liver that's what I
[2519.68 - 2525.52] say and you can say that too that's fine
[2522.76 - 2526.96] um but but there's so much to learn
[2525.52 - 2530.44] about this so let's talk a little bit
[2526.96 - 2534.20] more too about all of
[2530.44 - 2536.24] this you know it it's it's when you take
[2534.20 - 2537.84] when you take a walk every single day
[2536.24 - 2539.32] what are you doing you're saying well
[2537.84 - 2542.24] I'm glad I'm walking I'm glad I'm taking
[2539.32 - 2544.04] a walk when you take a walk every day
[2542.24 - 2545.12] I'm glad I'm you know people I talk to
[2544.04 - 2547.36] people and they're like well I took a
[2545.12 - 2549.36] walk today was good and I was doing this
[2547.36 - 2553.04] I was doing that I was really
[2549.36 - 2554.72] active and and it's incredible because
[2553.04 - 2556.28] someone's thinking about I was eating
[2554.72 - 2559.00] really good today I've said people tell
[2556.28 - 2561.20] me hey aw I'm eating really good today
[2559.00 - 2563.64] I'm actually I'm actually you should see
[2561.20 - 2564.36] it you should see what I'm doing and
[2563.64 - 2566.48] it's
[2564.36 - 2568.28] incredible and everything we do for
[2566.48 - 2570.04] ourselves we have to think about what am
[2568.28 - 2571.76] I doing for my liver is this helping my
[2570.04 - 2573.76] liver and and eating better can help
[2571.76 - 2575.16] your liver everything I'm doing can help
[2573.76 - 2578.56] the
[2575.16 - 2580.16] liver and so that's important I want to
[2578.56 - 2581.40] talk about bugs inside the liver for a
[2580.16 - 2585.44] couple of minutes
[2581.40 - 2587.20] too I really do and we'll go into this
[2585.44 - 2590.48] so there's all these unwanted bugs and
[2587.20 - 2592.24] poisons in our liver that are actually
[2590.48 - 2593.76] that are our liver is dealing with and
[2592.24 - 2596.12] our liver has its own immune system to
[2593.76 - 2597.64] help kill off these bugs so we want to
[2596.12 - 2599.28] support the liver's immune system so
[2597.64 - 2600.84] helping sluggish liver by supporting the
[2599.28 - 2602.12] liver's immune system is another way of
[2600.84 - 2603.56] getting it out of sluggishness because
[2602.12 - 2605.28] you're killing off the bugs that are
[2603.56 - 2607.64] inside of the liver and that's really
[2605.28 - 2609.60] important
[2607.64 - 2612.00] and the thing is it takes a lot of
[2609.60 - 2614.56] nutrients inside the liver in order to
[2612.00 - 2616.16] battle anything so that's why foods are
[2614.56 - 2618.12] so important in taking care of ourselves
[2616.16 - 2619.12] that's why we need to lower all the fats
[2618.12 - 2622.56] and we got to get all these other
[2619.12 - 2627.04] nutrients in there it's incredible the
[2622.56 - 2630.52] last thing a liver needs is fat the last
[2627.04 - 2634.28] thing if you ever hear that glucose
[2630.52 - 2636.48] sugar of any kind healthy sugar I mean
[2634.28 - 2642.24] hurts the liver is bad for the liver you
[2636.48 - 2643.80] have just heard the most negligent and
[2642.24 - 2646.40] disappointing
[2643.80 - 2648.00] and unbelievable pieces of
[2646.40 - 2649.92] misinformation there is in the
[2648.00 - 2652.76] industries if you hear that out there
[2649.92 - 2656.32] see that on the internet you just heard
[2652.76 - 2658.40] the worst of it because because what
[2656.32 - 2660.08] what happens out there is when you hear
[2658.40 - 2662.40] that then you don't know what to do the
[2660.08 - 2664.88] fat doesn't the fat isn't good for the
[2662.40 - 2667.84] liver doesn't want any fat going into it
[2664.88 - 2671.16] it doesn't want to deal with any fats so
[2667.84 - 2673.12] you have to remember that so when it's
[2671.16 - 2675.04] overburdened with having to deal with
[2673.12 - 2678.28] fat because it's overburden with Epstein
[2675.04 - 2681.32] bar bacteria heavy metals old DDT
[2678.28 - 2682.96] aluminum exposure it's pesticides and
[2681.32 - 2685.20] all the different cousins of pesticides
[2682.96 - 2686.92] insecticides everything like that you
[2685.20 - 2690.28] know I remember I
[2686.92 - 2693.72] remember when I got an apartment it was
[2690.28 - 2694.96] laced it was laced with insecticide when
[2693.72 - 2698.88] I got an
[2694.96 - 2700.80] apartment it was laced you can smell it
[2698.88 - 2703.56] I you to talk to a landlord landlord's
[2700.80 - 2706.76] like well yeah we did you know we we we
[2703.56 - 2709.44] do and we do an insect spray you know
[2706.76 - 2710.72] they come in here and they got the
[2709.44 - 2712.88] little you know they get the little
[2710.72 - 2715.16] machine and they're just got a little
[2712.88 - 2718.48] backpack and they're just spraying every
[2715.16 - 2719.72] corner of every wall and you know we're
[2718.48 - 2721.40] they they're spraying for this and
[2719.72 - 2723.40] spraying for that and it's just it's
[2721.40 - 2725.92] unbelievable where did all that go when
[2723.40 - 2728.76] I was standing there inhaling all that
[2725.92 - 2729.80] or living in it where did it all go when
[2728.76 - 2732.52] inside the
[2729.80 - 2734.12] liver it it just does even carpet
[2732.52 - 2735.28] cleaning chemicals just goes inside the
[2734.12 - 2737.00] liver everything goes in there so you
[2735.28 - 2739.96] got all these different
[2737.00 - 2742.96] things our livers are meant to purify
[2739.96 - 2747.52] and filter and hold on to the
[2742.96 - 2750.64] good so hold on to the good stuff so
[2747.52 - 2753.68] it's it they our livers become hoarders
[2750.64 - 2756.96] they hold on to the good things but they
[2753.68 - 2759.32] also have to hold on to the bad things
[2756.96 - 2761.52] the more bad things we get in the liver
[2759.32 - 2764.80] the less ability it can hold on to the
[2761.52 - 2767.96] good things and that's how it
[2764.80 - 2769.92] goes so we have to always remember that
[2767.96 - 2771.92] the more bad things the liver fills up
[2769.92 - 2774.24] creates a sluggish liver the more it can
[2771.92 - 2777.20] hold on to the good things the liver is
[2774.24 - 2779.52] filled with vitamins and nutrients going
[2777.20 - 2782.16] all the way back all the way back since
[2779.52 - 2784.64] the beginning including inherited
[2782.16 - 2788.24] meaning inherited meaning like literally
[2784.64 - 2790.04] from the family l nutrients from Mom and
[2788.24 - 2794.12] and and and her mom there are some
[2790.04 - 2797.12] nutrients that get passed along to our
[2794.12 - 2799.56] lier it has to have nutrients it holds
[2797.12 - 2803.64] on to a whole whole bunch of nutrients
[2799.56 - 2806.36] like unbelievable how many and then it's
[2803.64 - 2809.28] conversion the conversion ability cuz
[2806.36 - 2811.76] the liver converts everything it plays
[2809.28 - 2813.64] with things it moves things around it
[2811.76 - 2816.72] converts it I mean this is it's
[2813.64 - 2818.16] unbelievable about what the liver does
[2816.72 - 2821.96] and it releases
[2818.16 - 2825.32] nutrients and minerals and hormones all
[2821.96 - 2826.84] into the bloodstream and that's its job
[2825.32 - 2828.36] but yet its other job is to actually
[2826.84 - 2829.64] filter out all those poisons I just
[2828.36 - 2831.60] talked about and all those toxins that
[2829.64 - 2834.00] make it sluggish what happens is when
[2831.60 - 2835.20] those toxins are going up up up up up
[2834.00 - 2837.08] and up and they're climbing and they're
[2835.20 - 2838.80] climbing and climbing all the ability
[2837.08 - 2841.40] for the SL all the ability for that
[2838.80 - 2844.08] liver to actually being sending it to
[2841.40 - 2846.16] send out the right hormones the right
[2844.08 - 2847.64] conversions of nutrients methyl ating
[2846.16 - 2849.44] everything cuz the liver methylates
[2847.64 - 2852.76] virtually
[2849.44 - 2855.48] everything so all of that going on the
[2852.76 - 2857.76] liver can't do that anymore so you can
[2855.48 - 2859.72] get people who are mineral deficient or
[2857.76 - 2860.84] deficient or going to going to doctors
[2859.72 - 2862.24] or whatever it is and they're going to
[2860.84 - 2863.48] all these different doctors and they're
[2862.24 - 2864.84] getting all these different blood work
[2863.48 - 2866.52] all the profile and everything it's like
[2864.84 - 2867.96] you're deficient in this this this this
[2866.52 - 2869.56] this that's because of a liver problem
[2867.96 - 2872.12] and nobody even knows that and then
[2869.56 - 2873.96] they'll give you the wrong diet that
[2872.12 - 2876.48] will still keep your liver sluggish and
[2873.96 - 2877.88] keep it harmed that's the irony they'll
[2876.48 - 2879.36] take you off of you make sure you're not
[2877.88 - 2881.56] doing any fruit they'll make sure you're
[2879.36 - 2883.56] doing high protein which is high fat and
[2881.56 - 2885.72] they'll whatever including even if
[2883.56 - 2887.76] you're vegan or plant-based this isn't
[2885.72 - 2890.12] about animal protein people you're vegan
[2887.76 - 2892.72] or plant-based there just put lots of
[2890.12 - 2895.76] lots of fats and you could be hardly
[2892.72 - 2897.92] doing any fruit or leafy greens really
[2895.76 - 2900.44] just being doing lots of fats and so
[2897.92 - 2903.12] what happens is you got all these
[2900.44 - 2906.28] deficiencies it's all showing up
[2903.12 - 2907.80] everywhere and that's the liver
[2906.28 - 2911.32] that's how it
[2907.80 - 2913.40] works so I mean it goes goes on and on
[2911.32 - 2915.92] and on
[2913.40 - 2918.08] basically basically it's good to know
[2915.92 - 2919.44] that there's warnings that happen here's
[2918.08 - 2922.04] how it works with the liver too the
[2919.44 - 2925.36] liver neutralizes so it
[2922.04 - 2929.68] neutralizes it has to neutralize poison
[2925.36 - 2932.76] all the time it has to stop
[2929.68 - 2934.20] poisons and neutralize them so that you
[2932.76 - 2936.20] know what happens is when it's
[2934.20 - 2937.60] neutralizing I'll say it over and over
[2936.20 - 2939.88] again it's that important of a word for
[2937.60 - 2943.00] this that's why it's that
[2939.88 - 2945.80] important what that means is it's
[2943.00 - 2949.08] stopping the toxin from being as harmful
[2945.80 - 2952.84] as it really is so that when it leaves
[2949.08 - 2954.48] the liver it doesn't hurt you as much
[2952.84 - 2957.44] that's the power of the liver and what
[2954.48 - 2959.52] the liver can do it's it's
[2957.44 - 2961.80] extraordinary and so it's doing that so
[2959.52 - 2964.24] it has over 2,000 chemical functions
[2961.80 - 2966.20] that involve detoxification neutralizing
[2964.24 - 2969.00] poisons and everything else and what
[2966.20 - 2970.52] happens when your liver gets sluggish
[2969.00 - 2971.52] from all the different poisons that are
[2970.52 - 2973.20] already in the liver and then you're
[2971.52 - 2974.92] bombarding it with high fat diets and
[2973.20 - 2977.68] everything else what
[2974.92 - 2980.20] happens it loses it neutralizing
[2977.68 - 2982.80] capability that's how you age fast down
[2980.20 - 2984.48] the road sure you might not be looking
[2982.80 - 2986.72] like you're aging when you're in your
[2984.48 - 2988.44] 20s you might not be looking like you're
[2986.72 - 2991.20] aging when you're in your
[2988.44 - 2993.20] 30s but you know you start aging too
[2991.20 - 2996.40] fast when you get or people do you know
[2993.20 - 2999.28] they start aging too fast and that can
[2996.40 - 3001.56] happen that's a neutralizing ability is
[2999.28 - 3004.76] lost because of a sluggish
[3001.56 - 3008.64] liver the liver also has an anti-s
[3004.76 - 3012.08] sluggish emergency alarm response it's a
[3008.64 - 3015.48] chemical induced response that brings in
[3012.08 - 3018.72] new vital energy to break up stagnancy
[3015.48 - 3023.28] the response is a liver spasm this spasm
[3018.72 - 3026.48] can result in A tingle a twitch a slight
[3023.28 - 3029.92] ache a warmth a heat a pulling bloating
[3026.48 - 3032.52] a prickly feeling A Stitch in the
[3029.92 - 3036.00] side that's what this
[3032.52 - 3037.72] is it's incredible but you even lose
[3036.00 - 3039.56] that opportunity when the liver gets too
[3037.72 - 3042.56] sluggish and it starts breaking down you
[3039.56 - 3045.68] even lose that opportunity and that's
[3042.56 - 3048.44] the sad sad thing there are five
[3045.68 - 3050.16] varieties of sluggish liver so five

[3064.44 - 3070.36] now maybe I mean that's if we're
[3067.72 - 3072.84] lucky it's not even about the liver
[3070.36 - 3074.72] itself as a whole becoming sluggish it's
[3072.84 - 3077.04] different sections of the liver that
