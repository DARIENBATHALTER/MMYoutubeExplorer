had an name to him DDT radiation wasn't

30
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
on the radar as far as a toxin someone

31
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,799
had to worry about that was internally

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,520
embedded in their organs no nothing else

33
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,880

from solvents to everything else nobody

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,759
talked about that and as far as

41
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:08,920
pathogens went completely off the radar

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,120
not even the early hygienic movement of

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,879
Health knew about pathogens in fact they

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,360

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,239
medical medium information when the

50
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,760

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,840
an organic movement grew and then

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,720
life-changing foods and then thyroid

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,200
healing Liver Rescue celery juice and

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,720
the cleanse the heal book shortly after

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,879
that the new addition of medical medium

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,159
and the brainsaver books have changed

58
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,640
the world Millions have healed thousands

59
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:04,200
upon thousands countless amounts of

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,640
testimonials of serious chronic illness

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,799
serious conditions the books have saved

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,239
lives all around the world because they

63
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,000
work and a big part of those books was

64
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,640
the cleansing aspect people were able to

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,360
cleanse their bodies properly make a

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,480
difference move the needle and save

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,760
their lives get ready for some powerful

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,599
information it's time to

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,959
heal back years ago it would blow my

70
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,080
mind when I would hear somebody in the

71
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,319
health realm say you don't need a

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,439
cleanse you don't need to

73
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,920
detox you don't have to worry about

74
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,319
poisons and toxins because your body

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,560
cleanses

76
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,439
itself your body does everything it

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,480
needs to do all on its own when I heard

78
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:59,120
that and still hear it today it blows my

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,400
mind you don't hear it as much today I

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,280
think in part

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,760
just the work that Spirit of compassion

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,040
medical medium has done along the way

83
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,360
with letting people know that you do

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,680
have to cleanse to heal but you still

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,199
hear it once in a while your body

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,320
naturally cleanses and you don't have to

87
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:25,280
do anything for it I don't know anything

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,479
further from the truth our bodies take

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,199
on toxins every single day but it's not

90
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,000
just that we're born into this world

91
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,720
with toxins

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,759
even toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,800
cadmium lead arenic just to name a few

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,639
and then

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,880
copper that's a big one everybody's high

96
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,400
in Copper everybody's copper intoxicated

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,800
at this point toxic industrialized

98
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,520
copper so we have a lot of problems just

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,520
with toxic heavy metals alone and that's

100
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,800
a big one but then there

101
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,960
solvents solvents the chemical

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Industries create that enter our

103
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,199
bodies the thing is that we come into

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,600
this world toxic we automatically do and

105
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,160
people still to this day do not realize

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,880
that we come into this world with our

107
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,840
parents pasted in us their past whatever

108
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,280
they did drinking any kind of drugs

109
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,080
Pharmaceuticals they may have taken

110
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,080
along the way any kind of exposures

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,120
toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum

112
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,840
copper and petroleum products petroleum

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,000
based products gasoline lubricants

114
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,639
different creams and ointments that had

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
lead in there and different chemicals

116
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,360
perfumes colog

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,400
aftershaves things that our parents used

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,160
from the past all in us when we come

119
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,440
here and then there's DDT DDT was around

120
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:03,160
everybody it was everywhere in the past

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:06,080
it was the past and it's the present and

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,199
it's the future unfortunately it's in us

123
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,919
all everyone has traces of the dirty

124
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,800
past in them and guess what it stays in

125
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:20,120
them it does and it gets passed down to

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,919
generation to generation and generation

127
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,080
these days we have all that plus

128
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:29,000
something new the fragrances a whole new

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,800
wave of horror a whole new wave of

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,880
Terror on the body because our body

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,240
doesn't want thousands and thousands of

132
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,960
unknown unidentified chemicals that go

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,680
under the GU of fragrance in it our

134
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,759
bodies don't want that newborn babies

135
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,000
today are born with

136
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,680
fragrances hundreds and hundreds and

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,120
hundreds of chemicals that are not even

138
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,680
identified no one's taking a blood test

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,599
and saying whoa there are a thousand

140
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,840
chemicals in here a thousand ch

141
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,960
chemicals of Unknown Origin the reason

142
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,560
why they're not doing that is because

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,240
nobody knows what they are they don't

144
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,840
know what those chemicals are they can

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
only look for toxins they know and a lab

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,120
will test for all those chemicals and

147
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,120
toxins that just reside in us forever

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:27,039
it's not like they go away instead more

149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:30,479
and more come every day every hour every

150
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,000
year and our bodies they they have a

151
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,039
natural ability to detox yes they do

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,240
they have a natural ability to eliminate

153
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,599
poisons yes they do but what poisons and

154
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,240
what toxins because our bodies are

155
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,680
designed to eliminate

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,080
ammonia to eliminate old

157
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,720
adrenaline to eliminate other types of

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,840
blood gases and different toxins normal

159
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,199
toxins normal problems that our bodies

160
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,400
are supposed to be up against not

161
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,000
industrialized Industrial Revolution

162
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,280
nightmares as much as we need to

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,400
exercise for health our well-being for

164
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,080
our physical body a great mistake was

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,159
made in the exercise world the exercise

166
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,479
realm the realm of fitness and that

167
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,800
mistake was you're detoxing you're

168

sweating everything bad out so what

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,880
happens people think when they're doing

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,719
healthy exercising cardio they're

171
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,880
running they're jogging they're biking

172
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,640
they're skiing or they're just doing

173
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,399
lots of cardio workouts or lifting and

174
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,839

think they're getting rid of all their

176
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,959
toxins they think they're detoxing and

177
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,720
then the Shockers come professional

178
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,080
athletes getting cancer or getting sick

179
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,079
you would think they detoxed everything

180
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,440
that could possibly be detoxed out of

181
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,760
their body body they're sweating

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,399
profusely they're sweating every single

183
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,000
day they're working out really hard

they get cancer or they get some kind of

189
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,440
other sickness it doesn't make sense

190
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,880
here they are they're cleansing and

191
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,839
detoxing their lymphatic system has to

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,920
be the healthiest lymphatic systems on

193
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,680
this planet because blood and lymph it's

194
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,079
moving every day the amount of exertion

195
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,800
the amount of physical labor in the

196
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,880
exercise realm and the professional

197
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,760
athletic realm muscles that are laboring

198
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,959
every single day and lymphatic systems

199
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,560
that are constantly recycling and

200
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,120
purifying how is it possible cancer

201
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,519
Could Happen how is it possible they

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,240
could even get sick it's a shocker it

203
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,160
doesn't make any sense anybody in that

204
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,920
kind of physical shape should be able to

205
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,079
live forever live to be at least

206
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:16,519
105 but yet it doesn't work like that

207
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:20,360
people die people get sick people get

208
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,920
diseases literally people fall apart

209
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,040
there's so many different athletes out

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,000
there now that were at the top of their

211
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,360
game and could run an unbelievable

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,200
distance and now there's sick not well

213
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
they're getting surgeries their body's

214
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,360
falling apart and it doesn't make any

215
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,920
sense surely all of that sweating all of

216
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,120
that exercise all of that increased

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,120
heart rate all of that lymphatic

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,519
drainage naturally occurring should have

219
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,160
clearly detoxed them clearly set them up

220
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,040
for life to be less toxic than anybody

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,279
else and to be able to like live a good

222
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,560
long life without a problem but it

223
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,279
didn't no it

224
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,519
doesn't because sweating and exercise is

225
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,000
critical we need it for all kinds of

226
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,800
reasons but it doesn't detox us we can

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,680
stay just as toxic and collect more

228
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,959
toxins and they can stay in us and wreak

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,680
havoc and cause a lot of problems along

230
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,360
the way physical movement physical labor

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,560
exercise is critical for muscles it's

232
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,360
critical for connecting tissue it's

233
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,680
critical for joints it's important to

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,480
exercise even on a gentle basis but it's

235
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,760
not the end all be all doesn't work like

236
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,720
that you can still be highly toxic and

237
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,120
die early or just live a miserable life

238
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,959
being chronically sick you can still

239
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,000
have pathogens bugs viruses bacteria

240
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,519
harboring laying dormant or

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,760
proliferating in your body while you're

242
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,600
an exercise person while you're working

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,839
out and doing your thing out there and

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,959
you can still get sick from those bugs

245
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,279
keeping you from eventually exercising

246
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,920
at all that's why there's a lot of

247
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,880
athletes out there that are just stuck

248
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,040
severe chronic fatigue syndrome can't

249
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,279
even get out of bed because you can't

250
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,240
just sweat out those viruses those

251
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,600
pathogens the epscene bars the shingles

252
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,240
the herpes simplex one two the set

253
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,720
megavirus you can't just sweat those out

254
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,560
because they're still in the liver

255
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,120
they're still in the bloodstream they're

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,160
still in all the organs they're still in

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,800
connective tissue they're still in

258
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,440
muscles bugs and pathogens don't get

259
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,720
sweated out and then they're gone for

260
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,959
good and that brings me to something you

261
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,320
may hear out there it's like sweat it

262
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,720
out when someone has a flu it's like

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,199
exercise it out run it off sweat it out

264
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,079
doesn't work like that either in fact

265
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,800
when you're sick with things like

266
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,839
pathogens too much exercise runs down

267
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,279
the immune system doesn't strengthen the

268
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,240
immune system because it takes a strong

269
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,440
immune system to exercise to actually

270
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
work out that's why when somebody's

271
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,399
chronically sick they've been

272
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,160
chronically ill for a long time and they

273
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,600
do a workout maybe a first workout in a

274
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,639
long time now they're sick for 3 4 days

275
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,120
more or they get an episode where they

276
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,000
end up breaking out with some herpes or

277
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,880
a rash or some other problem and now

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,680
they're down and out or

279
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,160
they just feel wasted more fatigue more

280
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,600
fatigue than they felt in a long time

281
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,040
and they're in an episode it's because

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,440
their immune system is already battling

283
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,160
pathogens and probably toxic heavy

284
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,360
metals in that moment and their immune

285
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,399
systems overloaded or it's weakened and

286
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,279
not as strong as it needs to be so then

287
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,440
you're working out and you're exercising

288
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,800
and you end up tanking so many people

289
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,600
with chronic sickness and chronic

290
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,759
illness end up tanking after the

291
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,920
exercise

292
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,720
because their immune system can't do it

293
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,120
all it can't handle the recovery of the

294
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
exercise it can't handle the adrenaline

295
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,320
surge of the exercise and it can't

296
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,560
handle all the pathogens pathogenic

297
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Invaders somebody's up against the

298
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,040
reason why they're sick to begin with

299
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,959
because in the end what they really need

300
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,800
is they need to kill those bugs and

301
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,560
cleanse those toxins It's a combination

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,279
of both killing the bugs and cleansing

303
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,279
the toxins

304
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,759
whether somebody's an athlete or not the

305
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,120
quality of their life determines how

306
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,639
many toxins they've collected either

307
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,160
entered into this world with or how many

308
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,120
bugs they entered this world with or how

309
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,399
many toxins and bugs they collected

310
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
along the way

311
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,920
accumulated that determines how healthy

312
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,600
someone's going to be now there's other

313
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,240
factors around that but those are the

314
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,040
two big core factors right there then

315
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,360
there's also resour sources there's also

316
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,399
upbringing support and love but even if

317
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,959
somebody doesn't have the support they

318
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,839
don't have the resources they don't have

319
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,240
some things they need that other people

320
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,440
get if the pathogens and the toxins are

321
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,079
really high if they're there causing

322
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,759
problems then we're in trouble and then

323
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,120
we're struggling and once we're

324
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,680
struggling with a chronic illness things

325
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,360
get even more difficult because planet

326
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,839
Earth is already hard we carry our past

327
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,759
with us we carry our baggage with us we

328
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,680
all come with baggage it's 10 years 20

329
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,120
years 30 years 50 years of garbage

330
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,800
that's inside our body inside our liver

331
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,000
inside our organs inside our brain it's

332
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,279
our brains being dirty and filled with

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,440
all this baggage it's our heart muscle

334
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,240
being filled with this baggage it's our

335
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,519
kidneys it's everything inside our body

336
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,440
including our bones this baggage is a

337
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,199
history

338
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,480
of pesticides herbicides fungicides

339
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,959
perfumes colog scented candles air

340
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,120

341
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,560
Pharmaceuticals gasoline petrochemicals

342
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,560
lubricants aftershaves all kinds of

343
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,959
different health and beauty products

344
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,920
hair spray hair color everything that's

345
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,560
toxic out there in the world that past

346
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,680
is with us today and moves to our future

347
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,920
if someone's struggling with a mental

348
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
health condition they're struggling

349
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,279
emotionally they're struggling with

350
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,440
severe depression anxiety and it's

351
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,759
because of toxic heavy metals it's

352
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,399
because of mercury and aluminum and

353
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,959
copper inside their brain short

354
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,199
circuiting electrical impulses creating

355
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:48,639
OCD creating bipolar creating

356
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,160
depersonalization it stays with us it's

357
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,560
moving into the future with us it's the

358
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,279
past which is the toxic heavy metals

359
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,639
still in our brains and if we're not

360
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,600
cleansing these Metals out they stay in

361
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,440
there

362
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,480
the past comes with us to the Future

363
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,280
same thing with anything that's in our

364
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,400
system like pathogens if we're sick with

365
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,600
Epstein bar and that Epstein bar is

366
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,559
giving us thyroid conditions thyroid

367
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,360
issues Hashimoto or it's just giving us

368
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,160
fatigue and aches and pains we have that

369
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,480
bug but unless we get rid of it or knock

370
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,919
it back or clean it up or cleanse it out

371
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,360
unless we do that it comes with us in

372
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,039
the future we take it along with us and

373
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,400
move into the future with it we take all

374
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,320
these toxins all these poisons and these

375
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,679
pathogens and the pathogenic toxins that

376
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,440
the pathogens create and we take them

377
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:45,080
into the future and we live like that we

378
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,919
have our baggage we have our past we

379
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,320
bring it into the future so many people

380
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
out there are trying to get rid of their

381
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,080
past they're burning notes they're

382
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,039
burning journals they're trying to start

383
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,640
out fresh they're trying to meet new

384
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,240
people they're trying to do different

385
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,000
things gain new interests they're doing

386
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,120
healthy things they're trying to move

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,600
forward it's all about moving forward

388
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,600
they're doing yoga they're exercising

389
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,080
they're trying to better their lives all

390
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,159
of that is important they are trying to

391
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,600
move forward they are trying to get past

392
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,919
their past they want to start fresh but

393
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,120
unless they're cleaning out the toxins

394
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,400
and unless they're cleaning out the

395
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,400
poisons and the toxic heavy metals and

396
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,799
the pathogens the bugs you're really not

397
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,159
getting that Fresh Start you're not

398
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,360
getting that clean slate and that's why

399
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,760
cleansing is so important the more

400
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,440
toxins you have deep down in your body

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,120
the more food you have for bugs because

402
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,760
bugs eat the food they eat the toxins

403
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,120
that's their food okay so why would that

404
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,159
be such a big deal well to begin with

405
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,880
cancer cells those are viral cells those

406
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,960
are viruses that fed on toxic chemicals

407
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,720
and toxic waste which eventually CA C

408
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,080
the viruses to mutate and turn into a

409
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,159
cancer cell at some point so what

410
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,760
happens is when we have all these toxins

411
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,159
in us we have a campground Campground of

412
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,200
viruses feeding off these toxins and

413
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,320
then proliferating more eventually

414
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,080
mutating creating a problem down the

415
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,679
road which could be cancer cells so we

416
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,440
have to get rid of these toxins or we

417
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,159
have to get rid of the viruses we have

418
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,120
to do one or the other or at least a

419
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,400
little bit of both and then when it

420
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,799
comes to auto autoimmune any kind of

421
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,919
autoimmune diagnosis any kind of

422
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,480
condition and neurological symptoms

423
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,000
tightness of the chest tightness of the

424
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,240
throat aches and pains fatigue headaches

425
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,919
all the time tingles and numbness

426
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,480
ringing in the ears vertigo dizziness

427
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,159
any types of ticks and spasms Tremors

428
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,159
shakes restless leg syndrome and so many

429
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,600
more symptoms when it comes down to all

430
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,880
of those symptoms you're dealing with

431
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,640
viral issues viruses that are gobbling

432
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,159
down food toxins that's their food and

433
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,200
then they're releasing all of these

434
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,919
neurotoxins somebody could have more

435
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,760
Mercury than somebody else and then

436
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:14,080
their viruses are feeding off of that

437
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,280
mercury releasing a Mercury based

438
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,960
neurotoxin and that neurotoxin can make

439
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
life difficult for so many different

440
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
people could give them multiple

441
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,039
sclerosis symptoms or lime disease

442
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,000
symptoms or some type of symptom so it's

443
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,679
important to clean up those toxins it's

444
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,880
important to clean up those toxic heavy

445
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:37,120
metals and knock down those viruses kill

446
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,720
off those bugs all the different toxins

447
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,320
and all the different pathogens that

448
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,120
I've talked about so far don't just jump

449
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,799
out of the body and disappear they don't

450
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,480
leave easy they stay with us they live

451
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,520
in our organs they live in our flesh

452
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,000
they live in our bowels and they don't

453
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,360
just go away taking a handful of

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,240
charcoal drinking gallons of milk or

455
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,039
doing a long-term water water fast or

456
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,480
juice fast isn't going to get the toxins

457
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,039
out it isn't going to get the

458
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,760
petrochemicals out the solvents toxic

459
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,039
heavy metals or the pathogens they're

460
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,559
not coming out it's not enough you have

461
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,679
to do more than that you have to give

462
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,919
your body what it needs you have to

463
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,039
learn and know how to cleanse those

464
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,320
toxins out you have to know how to get

465
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,240
Metals out you need something that

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,840
actually works that matters all on its

467
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,039
own then we need something that works

468
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,000
against the path pens how to kill the

469
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,400
bugs off how to clean up those

470
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,559
neurotoxins that the bugs left behind

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,039
and then after that how to restore

472
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,919
organs how to restore nerves the central

473
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,720
nervous system how to restore the brain

474
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,600
after you've gotten rid of all the

475
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,520
toxins and the pathogens all of this

476
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,840
combined means everything one thing

477
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,320
people don't realize in the health

478
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,440
movement experts or gurus they don't

479
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,640
realize the emotional and memory toxins

480
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,799
the cells contain all through adrenaline

481
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,159
what happens when we go through

482
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,640
experiences in our life adrenaline is

483
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,360
involved there's messaging there's

484
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,440
information within that adrenaline

485
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,520
there's connections between our brain

486
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,919
and our adrenals so when we're in fight

487
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,080
or flight and something happened in our

488
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,919
life that memory stays in the cells

489
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,760
stays in the cells through adrenaline

490
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:26,600
and adrenaline stays in the cells it

491
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,559
could sit there for decades long after

492
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,919
something terrible or something trying

493
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,880
or a struggle or something difficult or

494
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,120
some adversity happened in somebody's

495
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,080
life that adrenaline can sit in cells

496
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
for decades sit inside the liver sit

497
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,600
inside all the different organs

498
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,840
including connective tissue and even

499
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,720
bones and when that adrenaline surfaces

500
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,960
because you start cleansing for the

501
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,679
first time in your life you start

502
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:59,360
releasing toxins and that adrenaline is

503
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,520
toxic that adrenaline has those mem

504
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,400
once it starts to release it starts to

505
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,440
come out you'll

506
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,000
experience certain feelings certain

507
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,400
Sensations even certain memories can

508
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,480
come up with a dream or in a dream and

509
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,480
that adrenaline is circulating now

510
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,159
through the body but it's not going back

511
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,520
into the body when you properly cleanse

512
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,679
it goes out of the body and leaves and

513
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,880
when that toxic adrenaline that old

514
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,919
adrenaline from years before leaves the

515
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,200
body you start feeling lighter you start

516
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,679
feeling more mentally clear because it

517
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,360
was sitting inside of you for decades

518
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,480
wreaking havoc creating chaos inside the

519
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,240
cells of the body and now it's gone if

520
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,120
you're doing the proper cleansing or

521
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,400
you're doing a proper cleanse the

522
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,320
problem with so many cleanses out there

523
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,320
is they're destructive to the adrenals

524
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,440
and destructive to the brain because

525
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,120
they don't offer enough

526
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,159
calories it's critical to be able to

527
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,080
offer calories while you're cleansing

528
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,760
fuel for the brain electrolytes for the

529
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,039
brain sugar glucose for the brain and

530
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,400
for the adrenals and that doesn't exist

531
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:20,720
in cleanses out there the medical medium

532
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,400
cleanses it does exist it is there it

533
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,760
protects the adrenals it creates a

534
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,120
situation where you can cleanse and heal

535
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,640
while feeding your body what it need

536
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,720
while feeding all of your organs what it

537
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,559
needs and that doesn't happen in

538
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:41,320
cleanses cleanses often starve somebody

539
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:45,279
of what they need they often either

540
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,440
starve them or they put a food in that

541
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,640
cleanse that stops the person from

542
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
cleansing so what I've noticed out there

543
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,840
all through the years that anytime

544
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,279
there's a cleanse there's either

545
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,679
something in the way of the person

546
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,520
cleansing that's offered in there or

547
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,480
it's starving them so they're getting

548
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,399
damage and truly not cleansing what they

549
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,520
need to cleanse one of the biggest

550
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,440
problems with cleanses is they don't

551
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,080
know what they're trying to cleanse out

552
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,840
up until recently with the medical

553
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,080
medium books educating people on what's

554
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,360
really in them the toxic heavy metals

555
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,679
and all the different poisons and the

556
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,679
Pharmaceuticals and all the pathogens

557
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,039
until that happened till that

558
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,080
information truly got out there no one

559
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,520
knew what they were cleansing it was

560
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,559
just toxins that was it not what were

561
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,840
the toxins not what else is happening

562
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,640
just toxins so the cleanses were

563
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,960
designed for Hit or Miss weak grass

564
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:44,039
juice lots of water but all guessing

565
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,440
games that's what the cleanses were but

566
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,799
when it comes down to Cleansing you

567
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,279
can't do the guessing game thing there

568
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,480
can't be any games at all it has to be

569
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,880
what works how do you cleanse how do you

570
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,720
heal what kind of toxins are actually in

571
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,120
the body what are they are they metals

572
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,240
how do we get those Metals out they just

573
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,640
don't cleanse out you need a way to

574
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,720
extract them out and what about all the

575
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,159
other toxins and then set that aside

576
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,279
what about the pathogens because in the

577
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,559
health movement nobody knew pathogens

578
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,880
were responsible for all the different

579
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,320
autoimmune the conditions the symptoms

580
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,200
the diseases and so forth nobody knew

581
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,480
that it's medical medium information all

582
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,200
these years that pathogens cause

583
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,320
neurological problems and symptoms so

584
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,039
all the cleanses were already obsolete

585
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,360
or didn't work at all because they

586
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,720
didn't even know that viruses and

587
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,840
bacteria were responsible for so many of

588
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,799
the different ailments so it was all hey

589
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,399
you got candida let's do a candida

590
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,799
cleanse but a candida cleanse would tear

591
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,640
somebody's guts up it would cause a

592
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,360
problem it wouldn't be good for the

593
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
person at all and it would starve them

594
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,960
of glucose for the brain and then

595
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,640
there'd be like a sodium bicarbonate

596
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,919
cleanse which would destroy any good

597
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,080
bacteria in their intestinal tract and

598
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,279
wreak havoc on their intestinal lining

599
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,960
and create immune system problems and

600
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:10,039
then it'd be a milk cleanse but a milk

601
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,640
cleanse just feeds all pathogens it

602
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,880
emboldens a pathogen it proliferates a

603
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,080
virus creating a problem that if

604
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,240
somebody was chronically ill with any

605
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
kind of neurological problems because of

606
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,000
pathogens the milk cleanse would make

607
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,399
that so much worse and then the water

608
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,559
fasts water fasting which atrophies the

609
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,360
brain it shrinks somebody's brain any

610
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
kind of glycogen storage that somebody

611
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,039
has in their brain when they do a

612
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,840
long-term water fast and they don't have

613
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,840
glycogen going in glucose going in for a

614
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,919
long time what happens is the brain

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,159
atrophies and then longterm juice

616
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,840
cleanses without the celery juice

617
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,360
without the sodium the celery juice

618
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,880
longterm juice fasts would shrink

619
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,440
stomachs create an elasticity problem in

620
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,799
the intestinal tracts from no

621
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,120
peristaltic action and then the

622
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,039
dangerous parasite cleanses the ones

623
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,039
that rip the intestinal tracts apart

624
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,320
with Clays using so many different

625
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,880
scratchy scratchy products these gut

626
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,880
health cleanses would irritate the

627
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,000
Linings of the intestinal track and the

628
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,440
colon creating a whole bunch of problems

629
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,919
for people and then there were the fruit

630
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,480
fear cleanses that no fruit allowed on

631
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,279
any level so it would just be like

632
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,679
sprouts and wheat grass juice and

633
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,200
nothing else where the person is being

634
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,120
starved of calories caloric action

635
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,559
starved of glucose for their organs

636
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,679
their muscles and their brains and then

637
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,519
they would atrophy in their muscles from

638
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,799
not getting enough glucose and they

639
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,840
would just be on wheat grass and Sprouts

640
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,720
then there was the long-term dry fasting

641
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,559
cleanses which is disastrous for

642
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,519
multitude of reasons and then there were

643
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,159
the autoimmune cleanses which are still

644
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,360
out there now in some shape or form and

645
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,519
the autoimmune cleanses have so much fat

646
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,159
in them so much over it fat that it's

647
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,240
impossible to cleanse anything therefore

648
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,320
nothing cleanses on an autoimmune

649
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,799
cleanse and what about other cleanses

650
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,039
that are high in fat which means no

651
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,640
cleansing happens with those either

652
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,519
there are dozens and dozens of cleanses

653
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,039
out there that have overt fat in it

654
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,919
which means the liver won't cleanse a

655
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,840
huge mistake in the cleansing world that

656
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,679
nobody knew which is you can't cleanse

657
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,960
any toxins or poisons out meaning deep

658
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,840
seeded ones and deep seeded Metals if

659
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,559
the high fat content in the bloodstream

660
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,640
is too high if the over fats are too

661
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:43,799
high some fat could be okay depending

662
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,000
but a lot of cleanses have a lot of MCT

663
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,519
oil they have a lot of other oils or

664
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,440
olive oil another cleanse out there

665
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,640
that's popular is drinking straight

666
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,799
olive oil as if that's going to cleanse

667
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,399
a person all that does is throw the

668
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,360
liver into chaotic shock and doesn't

669
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:03,640
cleanse it shuts down the liver

670
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,519
temporarily not allowing it to release

671
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,279
any toxins or poisons I can do this all

672
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,080
day but there is a right way to cleanse

673
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,000
and it's not just coming from a place

674
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,240
where I just started a cleanse of some

675
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,360
kind I'm excited about it and I want you

676
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,760
to know about it and give it a shot

677
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,360
comes from a place of Decades of

678
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,760
experience using information from above

679
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,360
that's already healed people so think

680
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,640
about that cleans es that already have a

681
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,360
track record that's the cleanses you

682
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,519
want the ones that have a track record

683
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,679
of healing the ones that have turned

684
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,640
people's lives around the ones that

685
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,600
actually worked and got rid of the

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,559
toxins and poisons lowered their weight

687
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,600
so they wouldn't have to go on OIC and

688
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,320
other weight loss drugs cleanses that

689
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,440
brought their lives back instead of

690
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,200
doing damage check out medical medium

691
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,159
cleanses celery juice the mono cleanse

692
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,240
the morning cleanse the heavy metal

693
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,360
detox cleanse the 369 cleanses the 28

694
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,799
day cleanse check them all out there's

695
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,880
even more realize that there is

696
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,639
information out there to turn your life

697
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,760
around to help you heal to starve

698
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,679
pathogens and not starve you to feed

699
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,919
your

700
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,279
brain and heal at the same time to give

701
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,919
your body what it needs the electrolytes

702
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,519
the glucose the antioxidants phychem

703
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,919
chemical compounds the nutrients while

704
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,440
you're healing to give you what people

705
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:39,679
worry about protein while you're healing

706
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,919
all of it is there it's unquestionable

707
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:48,519
and it works it's not scratchy Clays and

708
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,799
strange crazy ideas it makes sense and

709
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,240
when you do the medical medium cleanses

710
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,639
your life turns around like so many

711
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,720
people their lives have turned around

712
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:01,320
you can't lose your only win when you're

713
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,440
doing it and you heal and you move

714
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,279
forward keep that in mind if you're

715
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,360
somebody who's been through a lot and

716
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,159
you tried a lot of cleanses of the past

717
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,320
and you know the history of cleanses

718
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,240
know that when you do these you can

719
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,799
customize one to what you need you can

720
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,080
start small you can do the anti-bug

721
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,760
cleanse you can start at level one you

722
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,919
can do the morning cleanse you could

723
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,000
start with just celery juice or heavy

724
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,840
metal detox smoothie but keep in mind

725
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,200
healing is possible and you can move

726
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:37,080
forward without bringing the baggage and

727
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,279
the old toxic past with

728
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:45,399
you you can try what they sell you it's

729
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,760
most likely a trick or two their trendy

730
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:52,880
detoxes shadowed the old ones from

731
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:56,279
decades ago nothing new if one out of

732
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,440
500 felt better it was a

733
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,039
fluke and that was under strict

734
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,480
supervision so they can watch what

735
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,559
entered their mouths and came out of

736
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,200
their

737
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:12,559
shoots today one healed shouted from the

738
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,679
