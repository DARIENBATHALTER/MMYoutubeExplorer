15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,719
digestion has been a mystery to research

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
in science since the beginning of

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,559
research in science and nowadays it's

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,719
all about our gut all their problems are

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,080
because because of our gut we're told

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,000
but what do we really know about our

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,320

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
gut than we could ever even imagine that

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,280

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
whole hot dog slides down their throat

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,599
they didn't even chew it more than once

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,159
and they just got to shove it in as fast

75
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,239
as possible or maybe there's what is

76
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,159

there was a whole bunch of tacos and a

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,000
guy ate like a 100 tacos and and you

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,840
couldn't leave a mess on the plate they

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,360
said at the end of the con like during

82
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,799
the contest they said the whole plate

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,920
has to be cleaned and one guy didn't

84
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,159
clean the whole plate so he lost there

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,879
was like a couple of tomatoes left and a

86
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,799
little bit of guacamole and some beans

87
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,400
and some meat sauce all left in the

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,239
plate and and then there's restaurants

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,319
that say you can eat for free if you

90
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,920
finish what they're selling right like

91
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,079
you look on the menu and they sell

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,599
something called the big big boy and

93
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,360

94
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,239

barrel of beans right and if you can

97
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,000
finish that your whole family can eat

98
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,680
for free but you got to be one person

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,359
sitting there at the table and they only

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,560
give you like two hours so you sit there

101
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,919
eating it and if you can get to the end

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,120
of that then the whole family eats for

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,039
free you know a friend of mine he didn't

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,919
do that but his friend did that at a

105
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,600
restaurant where they brought out this

106
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,800
massive 20 lb steak I don't know what it

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,280
was it was just so huge he said and he

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,120
sat there eating his friend sat there

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,919
eating it and eating it so that they

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,400
would be having a free meal he would win

111
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,919
in the end and he was eating it eating

112
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,919
it they had to rush him to the hospital

113
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,199
because he had this stomach cramp that

114
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,600
was so bad my friend told me that he

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,120
fell on the floor and he was in fetal

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,520
position on the floor trying to pass gas

117
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,080
and everybody in the restroom got scared

118
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,080
and the whole crowd gathered around him

119
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,639
as he was trying to push gas out of his

120
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,280
stomach and he was farting and then he

121
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,320
was kind of like an Agony moaning and

122
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,560
yelling my friend said it was so bad

123
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,639
they had a call Emergency Services 911

124
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,560
now this guy was only halfway through

125
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,039
his stake and he was a really big guy

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,680
meaning like he was

127
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,479
6'4 he was like

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,400
240 lbs uh he had some muscle on him and

129
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,639
everything and but he was known by his

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,240
friends to be able to eat a lot as much

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
as he wanted and drink too so he can

132
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,919
drink a whole bunch of beer and eat all

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,520
that now he said this is from him he

134
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,000
said that the reason why it happened was

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
because he ate something before this big

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,080
dinner he was eating and he knew not to

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,000
do it it's like one of those things

138
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,520
where you know better and you know you

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,360
shouldn't have or maybe postpone it and

140
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,440
do it another day at the restaurant but

141
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
he said he couldn't help it he wanted

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
the challenge but he had something

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,560
before it he had a cheeseburger an hour

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
before it and he said that didn't sit

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,720
right on top of what he was putting down

146
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,960
in and like I said this guy was a big

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,160
guy 6'4 body mass like big which leads

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,160
me to this other thing which makes me

149
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,280
scratch my head confounds me really is I

150
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,240
saw an eating contest and it's a bunch

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,560
of people lined up it was on television

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,280
it was like many years ago and there was

153
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,440
this woman with a bunch of men so there

154
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,319
was a bunch of men and they're all big

155
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,840
guys and then there was this woman she

156
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,160
was in the contest sitting at a table

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
and they were all going to eat the same

158
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,039
thing it was like I don't know a 5B

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,759
Burger something crazy it was something

160
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,240
that you just can't eat it's actually

161
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,479
scary and she won the contest which was

162
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,280
crazy to me because she was with all

163
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,960
these other guys they were big guys some

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,199
of them were like six feet tall 6 foot

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
like five or just really big guys and

166
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,639
that means their stomach was probably

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,879
really big she was like 105 lb and when

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,360
I think about that it boggled my mind I

169
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:14,440
watched it and I was like Spirit just

170
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,199
tell me what's going on here and what

171
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,800
was amazing is she could stretch her

172
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,440
stomach her stomach was stretching now I

173
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,720
always knew that your stomach stretches

174
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,960
absolutely people can eat a lot more and

175
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,879
you stretch your stomach more but there

176
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,639
was a vast difference here

177
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,360
with who was at this table there were

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,400
people that were much much bigger men

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,639
large stomachs eating a lot and she was

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:47,520
small petite and ate the same thing and

181
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,840
that's the miracle of the human body

182
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
that's the miracle of our digestive

183
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,000
system that's the superior strength of

184
00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:00,039
our stomachs the world's not an easy

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,960
place to live confrontation obstacle

186
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:07,960
trials losses hardships betrayal that's

187
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,199
a big one right there so many people get

188
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:17,080
betrayed all through their life and in

189
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:22,360
this we tend to use food as a drug a

190
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:26,400
pill to sweep us away into a safe place

191
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,000
stress can do this and some of us we

192
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,280
overeat everybody experienced that

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,519
before or it's easy to do just run

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,560
across a little bit of stress have a

195
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,200
little bit of hardship hard times and

196
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,640
you see something and there it is

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
there's that chocolate cake there's that

198
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,480
Bagel there's that double deck or

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,440
whatever there's that croissant whatever

200
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,839
it is it's easy to fall prey to it it's

201
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,000
not even just that you might be saying I

202
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,880
don't eat croissants aw I don't eat

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,800
double decker cake whatever that is I

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,920
eat a whole big batch of macaroni and

205
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,560
cheese and I can't stop and I keep on

206
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:14,040
shoveling it in I eat a whole pizza not

207
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,160
a half a pizza or I eat too many slices

208
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,680
everybody has their own method it's a

209
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,480
survival method we tend to overeat hey

210
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,800
no judgment that's just life here and

211
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,200
wait you might be somebody that doesn't

212
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,600
overeat like that but you undereat you

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,880
don't eat stress comes along some

214
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,360
confrontation some hardship some

215
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,240
adversity maybe just a difficult time in

216
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,240
your life maybe you were betrayed and it

217
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,920
felt so terrible in the pit of your

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,360
stomach food was the last thing you

219
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,040
wanted and even as time kind of went by

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,399
and the Betrayal kind of eased off you

221
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,279
still weren't that hungry to want to

222
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,880
tank or eat a large amount of food at

223
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,720
once so you're the kind of person to

224
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,800
just just eat a little bit kind of just

225
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,600
for survival along the way that happens

226
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,640
too A lot of people run into this and

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,200
they just have that pit of stomach nerve

228
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,839
nausea the upset you feel like your

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,079
heart was swallowed and it ended up in

230
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,079
the pity of your stomach and the last

231
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,600
thing you want to do is actually eat now

232
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,959
why am I even talking about all this

233
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,959
because our stomach has to do what we

234
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,920
tell it to do it has to do whatever we

235
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,959
say or do it doesn't matter it has to

236
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,279
listen it has to obey because it's

237
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,519
sitting there it's not going to be able

238
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,959
to stop you it can't say hey don't do

239
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,920
that or whoa you're stretching me man

240
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,920
you're stretching me way too far or hey

241
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm shrinking I'm shrinking over here

242
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,120
and I'm getting smaller and smaller or

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,680
whoa you stretched me way too fast whoa

244
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,079
that was a lot you put in in there just

245
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,600
now or oh my God I'm shrinking so much I

246
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,000
think I'm going to disappear on you

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,800
right now I think you got to put

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,279
something in the tank I know you got

249
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,600
some emotional stuff going on right now

250
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,480
I know you got hardships but you got to

251
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,399
put something in me our stomach is under

252
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,600
our beck and call it's under our roof so

253
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,959
when we swallow something it has no say

254
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,079
no say to what's coming down the pike it

255
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,040
just has to grin and bear it take the

256
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,120
brunt and maybe you're someone that

257
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,279
doesn't think I'm right about this

258
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,160
thinking I'm off the mark But I think we

259
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,279
got to have some respect for our

260
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,240
stomachs because our stomachs get

261
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,200
disrespected I'm wrong well you know

262
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,240
what I think about those stories you

263
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,240
always hear out there where it's College

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,399
it's a party someone sticks a pipe down

265
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,639
their throat someone's standing on a

266
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,000
ladder or a chair and they're dumping

267
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,360
all the this beer and alcohol down the

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,240
pike and someone's on the floor on their

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,959
knees looking up pipes in their throat

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,880
and they're trying to send it all down

271
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,519
into their stomach one shot and then

272
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,240
everybody screaming and then the pipe

273
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,120
flies out and spit goes everywhere it's

274
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,399
like do it again and someone else gets

275
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,920
there and does it again and then a few

276
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,920
hours later shove a pizza down the pike

277
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,199
down the gullet think about that

278
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,000
person's poor stomach but people don't

279
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,959
really think about people's poor stomach

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,320
they think about people they're like oh

281
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,399
wow that person had a great time or that

282
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,079
person overdid it that person did yeah

283
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
that person did way too much oh they're

284
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,920
kind of sick the next day but no one's

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,199
saying hey that person's stomach is shot

286
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,399
today hey that person's stomach is

287
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,639
really not feeling great today that

288
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,560
person's stomach went through hell last

289
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,399
night you should talk to that person's

290
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,760
stomach hey stomach are you okay in

291
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,560

292
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,240
get it I get it this isn't you you don't

293
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,680
binge out or you never did anything like

294
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,560
this you're more balanced you're more

295
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,680
moderation or self-care day right so

296
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,399
yours is about well here's my self-care

297
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,079
day or here's my cheat day or here's my

298
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:20,600
moderation day um but you're the one

299
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,920
governing it right your stomach still

300
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,560
has to be at your beck and call your

301
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,360
stomach still has to be at your mercy at

302
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,199
your mercy

303
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:37,399
and maybe your cheat day oh sorry maybe

304
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,800
your self-care day or maybe your balance

305
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,160
day or moderation day because

306
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
everybody's calling it different now

307
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,560
different things it used to be called

308
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,920
cheat day so so maybe your self-care day

309
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,560
is different than somebody else's

310
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,560
self-care day or maybe your stomach

311
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,279
doesn't like your self-care day but you

312
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,399
like your self-care day maybe you like

313
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,680
your moderation day but your stomach is

314
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,240
like moderation this isn't the

315
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,959
moderation I need right now a lot of

316
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,079
people out there will tell you what they

317
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,600
need like what their needs are for what

318
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,959
they want to eat doesn't mean it's their

319
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,079
body's needs are being met doesn't mean

320
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,560
their stomach needs are being met it's

321
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,360
kind of like whatever their

322
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,279
Consciousness is right if we were raised

323
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
on a different planet and they only gave

324
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,480
you so much food like this or this or

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,560
this that's all you would have but

326
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,519
humans tend to

327
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,480
make

328
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,800
concoctions we like Delights we're

329
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,560
raised on chicken fingers we're raised

330
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,079
on fish sticks we're raised on Burgers

331
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,639
we're raised on fries with oil we're

332
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:47,320
raised on melted cheese that gets all

333
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,399
crusty and brown in the oven we're

334
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,600
raised on ice cream we're raised on a

335
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,560
lot of different foods

336
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,399
Abominations you might be somebody

337
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,560
saying he's wrong I listen to my body no

338
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,759
you listen to your Consciousness and

339
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,639
what it was trained to eat our

340
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,880
Consciousness the very thing attached to

341
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,120
the emotional centers of the brain that

342
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,720
means food's emotional we get emotional

343
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,000
and then our Consciousness plays tricks

344
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,880
it's interesting it's like no I'm

345
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
intuitively eating well I've seen people

346
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,839
say they're intuitively eating and what

347
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,480
they're eating I'm like whoa okay if

348
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,160
that's intuitively what you're eating I

349
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,199
got all the respect for you but man

350
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,120
that's SC with what you're eating or if

351
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,199
somebody that says well I'm eating in

352
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,560
moderation or I heard someone said you

353
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,519
could eat in moderation there

354
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
Consciousness then adopts that and it's

355
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,839
like well it fits into what I want to

356
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,759
eat I could say I'm eating this in

357
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,040
moderation I could get away with it but

358
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:52,880
our Consciousness can learn bad or good

359
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,800
it can learn bad and not so bad and

360
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,440
halfway bad and pretty bad or really bad

361
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,720
or can learn bad

362

good your Consciousness can learn all

367
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,560
the good things and then it can connect

368
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,199
to that emotional center of the brain

369
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,880
and relearning can happen but there's

370
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,079
something you need to know your

371
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,519

told organic coffee is actually really

403
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,240
good for us too and our Consciousness is

404
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,200
tricked once again but that might be

405
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,320
your your moderation or your intuitive

406
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,080

408
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,400
day which is you sit and have your

409
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,760
coffee you're liking it your

410
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,080
Consciousness is liking it doesn't mean

411
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,799
your stomach's liking it doesn't mean

412
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,760
your stomach likes it at all you see

413
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,919
those people out there they eat what

414
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,559
they want you watch them they go to any

415
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,640
restaurant they could sit down at the

416
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,480
restaurant they can order like surf and

417
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:37,240
turf they can order Lobster they can

418
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,280
order clams muscles oysters Lobster move

419
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,520
that over after they finish some of it

420
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,159
and then big old juicy steak comes with

421
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,799
butter on top whole bunch of onion rings

422
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,679
on the side maybe some other appetizers

423
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,679
crab cakes all of a sudden they're

424
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,480
eating crab cakes right or maybe they're

425
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,159
eating something else like some kind of

426
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,039
just soup that's loaded with oil on top

427
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,159
has dairy in it cheese parmesan cheesee

428
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,400
all sprinkled over it maybe it's just a

429
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,080
big bowl of

430
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,520
pasta with cheese or just fetuccini

431
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,760
Alfredo maybe it's just Cookies Cakes

432
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,000
and donuts ice cream and some pizza and

433
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,280
then they get sick now it doesn't mean

434
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,200
the food made them sick really in the

435
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,640
end it could have been anything

436
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,919
pathogens viral load Epstein bar

437
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,679
bacteria like strepto coctus immune

438
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,320
system problems toxic heavy metal

439
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,559
chemical exposure it could be anything

440
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,400
added all up and bundled up and then the

441
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,120
foods did not help a lot of people head

442
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
to the doctors when they're not feeling

443
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,880
good and they're getting sick and they

444
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,640
may go through a lot of doctors before

445
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,039
they even start changing their diet

446
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
sometimes they'll see two or three

447
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,360
doctors or more doctors these days will

448
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,080
tell you to get off the sweets and the

449
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,520
junk and any of the processed foods and

450
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,280
that's a good place to start but in the

451
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,600
end it's not too far far from what they

452
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,919
were eating

453
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,280
previously even if they go to the best

454
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,360
functional medicine doctor these days

455
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,360
they're still going to be eating pretty

456
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,720
much close to what they used to eat

457
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,480
except they'll keep a lot of the

458
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,039
processed food out the sweets the junk

459
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
but the protein will be there all the

460
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,559
fat will be there they'll still be

461
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,080
eating the meals they remember they

462
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,720
always remembered they'll still have

463
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,919
their chicken they'll still have their

464
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,559
meat now if they're a vegan they're

465
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,240
still going to have their nuts they're

466
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,200
still going to have their seeds they're

467
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,080
still going to have their oils they're

468
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,440
still going to have their beans they're

469
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,480
still going to have their vinegar and

470
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,799
they're still going to have their

471
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,000
chocolate whether vegan or animal

472
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,240
protein eaters they're still going to

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,720
have all those things but they're going

474
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,400
to put the brakes on the processed foods

475
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,640
and many people get improvements cuz

476
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,320
they clean up so much nasty stuff in

477
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,720
their diet so they start to improve in

478
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,400
different ways but then there's a lot of

479
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,720
people they only improve so much or none

480
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,559
at all and they're on the search for

481
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,039
something different because they go to

482
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,080
another doctor to another specialist and

483
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:18,120
another and the diets are all kind of

484
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,080
relatively the same even if they hit a

485
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,080
food elimination doctor in the end you

486
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,360
still got to eat you still got to live

487
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
so it turns out to kind of be the same

488
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,120
old thing maybe you can put in name on

489
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,320
it keto is one of the names it could be

490
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,880
another name a lot of people are naming

491
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,080
things differently to try to be their

492
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,840
own way but it all ends up the same kind

493
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,400
of food but just done a little

494
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,799
differently and whatever portions you've

495
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,640
been eating is relatively the same as

496
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,400
well so it's not just the advice from

497
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,559
your functional medicine doctor or

498
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,960
doctors about getting rid of the

499
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,799
processed foods the fried foods the

500
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,159
greasy Foods cleaning things up looking

501
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,120
out for what you're doing it's more than

502
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,120
that it's kind of the portions are still

503
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,000
kind of relatively the same you're

504
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,640
trying to survive you're eating what

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,360
you've known your whole life the amount

506
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,320
you're eating is kind of what you've

507
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,039
known your whole life since you were a

508
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,440
kid and your Consciousness is still

509
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:21,000
programmed to what it's always been your

510
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,960
whole life even though you've cleaned up

511
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,240
your diet a little bit and maybe it's

512
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,240
not just your functional medicine doctor

513
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,520
maybe it's your nutritionist maybe it's

514
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,520
your health coach

515
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,600
maybe it's your trainer maybe it's your

516
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,240
healthc care advisor maybe it's your

517
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,679
dietitian or it's something you read or

518
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,840
seen an influencer do and that's what

519
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,960
you adopted through your Consciousness

520
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm going to try that but in the end

521
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,000
it's still close to what you've always

522
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,080
done in the way you've always done it

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,960
and then you're still not better and

524
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,600
then something inside of you tells you

525
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
you have to go further you're desperate

526
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,799
you're on your hands and knees you're

527
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,360
praying to God and at night wondering if

528
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,559
you're going to live your life the way

529
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,720
you want to wondering if you're still

530
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,760
going to live it all because the

531
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,960
symptoms get to you it's breaking down

532
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,440
your mind it's breaking down who you are

533
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,559
people around you aren't happy you're

534
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
being looked at like you're a complainer

535
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,279
or you're somebody that's just a

536
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,679
hypercondriac and you're just like I

537
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,279
can't take this anymore and nothing

538
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,320
seems right to what you're doing and

539
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,799
then something happens you break a

540
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,320
barrier you break down a wall and you're

541
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:37,080
like I have to find something something

542
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,480
doesn't matter what it is maybe fruit is

543
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,320
okay to do but I've been told it's so

544
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,880
bad I hear medical medium information

545
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,360
has healed a lot of people but it's

546
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,960
fruit involved and I've been told

547
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,480
fruit's awful by every single functional

548
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,960
doctor and trainer and dietitian that I

549
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,000
have to be very careful and just have a

550
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,360
little fruit once in a while and it's a

551
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,360
certain kind of fruit and but I need to

552
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,640
heal and then you look into it maybe you

553
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,400
grab a book maybe you read cleanse the

554
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,039
heel and you see smoothies in there but

555
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,480
specific smoothies and then you see more

556
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:22,080
fruit and then you see leafy greens and

557
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,279
wild foods and herbs and the whole thing

558
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,679
seems foreign maybe you didn't learn it

559
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
from medical medium maybe you learned it

560
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,080
from from somebody who learned it from

561
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,840
medical medium 20 years ago bring in

562
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,480
more fruits more vegetables more living

563
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,840
fresh fruits more living fresh

564
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
vegetables or maybe you picked up some

565
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,480
tips from a vegan more fruits and

566
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,880
vegetables and then whatever version you

567
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,080
found out there you tried you did it

568
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,039
something didn't feel right something

569
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,480
didn't sit right in your stomach weren't

570
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,559
feeling that great kind of confused

571
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,120
about it at all tried it for a while and

572
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:07,000
then rode it off it didn't work for you

573
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,159
and you saw something out there like I'm

574
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,039
going to eat intuitively or what my body

575
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,279
needs or moderation or

576
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,320
orthorexia whatever it was you were

577
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,399
turned off you didn't understand it what

578
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,039
you were putting in your body how your

579
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:26,880
body works you didn't have all the

580
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:30,399
details and you didn't know that what

581
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,640
your consciousness believes or wants is

582
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:36,880
much different than what your body needs

583
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,720
or wants now all these years your

584
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,600
Consciousness was trained to eat the way

585
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,760
you were eating and your body was

586
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,200
adapting to what your Consciousness was

587
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,320
training your body to do they were

588
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,919
working together all those years in the

589
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,360
past now you're trying something new

590
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,919
your Consciousness is struggling to what

591
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,120
you're trying to learn it's used to what

592
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,960
it used to know in the emotional Center

593
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,360
of your brain right Comfort Foods eating

594
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,159
a certain way your whole life it's

595
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,360
different now and your body was adapted

596
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,600
to all that for many years so your

597
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,640
body's like whoa this is different too

598
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,240
so it can feel uncomfortable both

599
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,880
mentally and physically but here's the

600
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,360
key you're sick you haven't been well

601
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,279
for a while now you got symptoms

602
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,399
conditions you've been seeing lots of

603
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,520
doctors you're burnt out you tried so

604
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:32,440
many things you've been there you done

605
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,559
that so you're desperate you know you

606
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,240
have to push forward you know you have

607
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,200
to try something new your body doesn't

608
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,559
feel good because it's used to what you

609
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,399
used to do your Consciousness doesn't

610
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,640
feel good because that's used to what

611
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,919
you used to do and you already don't

612
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,320
feel good cuz you're sick you got all

613
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,159
these symptoms you don't know if you're

614
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,520
coming or going you don't know if it's a

615
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,600
food that did that one day or you don't

616
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,159
know if it's actually a new symptom you

617
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,080
don't know what your doctor said it

618
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,640
might be these things and your friend

619
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,600
said it might be this and you're

620
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,840
thinking like what is wrong with me was

621
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,880
it something I ate a couple days ago is

622
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,720
it something I'm doing wrong wait a

623
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,799
minute that symptom feels the same as it

624
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,679
always was hey that's a symptom I had

625
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,880
two years ago I think when I journaled

626
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,640
it I don't know I'm losing my mind do

627
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,760
you remember the thing we talked about

628
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,840
earlier the stomach stretching and the

629
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,600
stomach

630
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,679
shrinking well that's a part of all of

631
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,399
this it's the part when you're gravit

632
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,240
ating to a new type of eating a way you

633
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:37,960
really never ate before in your life

634
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,279
much different than the small condensed

635
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,960
high fat high calorie meals you were

636
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,640
used to all these years or the large

637
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,480
condensed high fat high calorie meals

638
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,720
you've been used to all these years some

639
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,120
people eat a lot more of that some

640
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,399
people eat a lot less of that the people

641
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,880
who are eating less of that their

642
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,360
stomachs shrinking they live their life

643
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,399
with their stomach really shrunk small

644
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,480
and then there's people who eat a lot of

645
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:06,880
that they're walking around with their

646
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,440
stomachs expanded stretched every day

647
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,080
either way they're both eating

648
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,200
relatively the same kind of food so

649
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,640
let's start with the person who has a

650
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,240
stomach that's shrunk all these years

651
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,720
they walk around with a shrunk stomach

652
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,679
did you ever run across a person who had

653
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,480
a banana one big banana they couldn't

654
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,480
even get the whole thing down they

655
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,080
peeled it they're eating it they're

656
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,840
moving through the banana and they all

657
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,279
of a sudden have a look on them like oh

658
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,559
my God this is just so much they get

659
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,399
down to the bottom of the banana and

660
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,600
they ate it and they're like that was a

661
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,440
lot do you want me to eat another one

662
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,039
are you crazy I can't eat two of those

663
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,080
big bananas now if you chopped up that

664
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,600
banana or sliced it up or sliced up two

665
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,159
bananas and put it on a plate lined it

666
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,039
up all against each other it's going to

667
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,039
be roughly around the same amount of

668
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,480
food as a chicken breast it's not going

669
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,080
to be the same amount for a lot of

670
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,080
reasons but it can look the same volume

671
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,000
maybe even more and so what happens is

672
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,399
someone who has a shrunk stomach is used

673
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,760
to a small chicken breast and that's

674
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,480
what they're used to they're not used to

675
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,799
a watery banana cuz a banana has water

676
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,440
in it it's got pulp fiber yes it's got

677
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,279
protein in it yes it's got a little bit

678
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:30,519
of fat in there but it's protein fiber

679
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,279
water SU suar and it's volumous so

680
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,120
someone with a Shunk stomach be like oh

681
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,039
my God it was hard to eat two whole

682
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,279
bananas that was really hard I just want

683
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,399
my chicken breast with a little cheese

684
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,519
on top well that chicken breast with a

685
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:49,200
little cheese on top or a sauce that's

686
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:52,279
fatty and oily is really dense really

687
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,799
dense in caloric action too now there's

688
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,320
fat in there there's calories too but

689
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,159
there's fat you got the protein but it's

690
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,039
dense in the stomach and it feels like

691
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,360
it's a weight so when you eat it it's

692
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,159
all you need to someone who's got a

693
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,880
shrunk stomach who's been eating like

694
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,480
that all these years then when they peel

695
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,600
a big old banana bag and they're eating

696
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,960
it it's hard for them to get down to the

697
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:21,080
end of that banana God forbid they have

698
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,159
two or three bananas never mind a

699
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,320
smoothie with three bananas wild

700
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,480
blueberries oranges maybe some leafy

701
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,760
Greens in there the person with the

702
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,399
shrunk stomach the small stomach from

703
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,679
all these years of eating small

704
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:38,840
condensed meals is going to think that's

705
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,279
a large amount of food so if it was a

706
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,720
smoothie with all that in there it would

707
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,279
be too much they would only be able to

708
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,440
have half a glass of that smoothie or a

709
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,080
glass of that smoothie at best and they

710
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,559
would nurse it it's just way too much

711
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,519
food instead of a hardboiled egg

712
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,080
something they are used to a lot of

713
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,799
people that have this the shrunken

714
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,639
stomach where it's small and shrunk all

715
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,519
these years they're used to like a

716
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,600
poached egg a hard boiled egg a fried

717
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,760
egg with a little piece of toast a

718
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,000
couple of strips of bacon on the side

719
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,039
maybe a cup of coffee maybe a little

720
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,399
chocolate treat later or they'll eat

721
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,480
small little meals throughout the day of

722
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,919
treats and things they like until they

723
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,320
have their dinner which is a small

724
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:27,360
chicken breast again or a small 4 o

725
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,600
piece of meat and here's the problem the

726
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,480
banana is not going to have enough

727
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,760
calories to match that slice of toast

728
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,639
believe it or not the poached egg the

729
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,399
two strips of bacon they a little

730
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:43,639
chocolate treat the banana won't equal

731
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,279
that two bananas won't equal that the

732
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,000
calories that they're used to are fat

733
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,600
they're dense and then they sprinkle

734
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,799
about little treats with sugar like the

735
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,000
bad sugar in it throughout the day so

736
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,399
they're getting their little sugar highs

737
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,360
they're getting their adrenal and

738
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,360
caffeine high while they're doing their

739
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,200
dense little meals and having little

740
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,000
treats in and around it but they're not

741
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,279
eating a large amount of food or they're

742
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,799
not eating larger amounts of food their

743
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,360
stomach is shrunk their stomach is small

744
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:15,399
they eat one banana it's not enough to

745
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,360
get them by but yet the banana is too

746
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,799
filling it's taking up too much space

747
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,559
two bananas Three Bananas taking up too

748
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,360
much space a whole smoothie is too much

749
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,279
for them to drink in the morning they're

750
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,279
used to a hardboiled egg two strips of

751
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,480
bacon little piece of toast they don't

752
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,440
even finish it all they have a cup of

753
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,200
coffee they have a treat somewhere in

754
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
the middle of it all they'll have a

755
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,279
treat in the middle of the day they'll

756
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,279
have sugar and another cup of coffee

757
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:45,919
later to get some calories but they're

758
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:49,559
not having a large amount of food at

759
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,120
once so you have a smoothie it has less

760
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,039
calories but it's the foods you need to

761
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,600
heal here they are they're sick and they

762
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,120
need to move to these fresh Fresh Living

763
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,039
juicy

764
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,919
fruits and they can't get there the

765
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,360
thing is is that smoothie could be more

766
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,679
food than they've eaten in a whole day

767
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,000
not more calories than they've eaten in

768
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,840
a whole day just the volume a big old

769
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,360
smoothie of all that liquid in there the

770
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,200
juice in there the pulp the fiber and

771
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,039
they're not used to that and that could

772
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,559
be more food and that smoothie than

773
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,919
anything else they've done in a whole

774
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:31,039
day now we're not even talking about the

775
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,960
salad now what about a big salad people

776
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,279
have small salads and they have small

777
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,880
salads with dense things in there

778
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,880
they'll have feta cheese they'll have

779
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,000
tuna in their salad they'll have salmon

780
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,760
in their salad that's really popular

781
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,559
hardboiled eggs in their salad ham in

782
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,240
their salad cheese hard chees is in

783
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,960
their salad croutons will be throwing in

784
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,159
there a few of them maybe but the salad

785
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,720
isn't a lot of greens like lots and lots

786
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,000
of greens in their salad so what if we

787
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,720
have to do that now we have to get a

788
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,320
salad and then we have to have things on

789
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,839
there that adds into it too it's a lot

790
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,839
of food what they usually do is they'll

791
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,040
have this little salad with all these

792
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,800
dense things on top like the egg and the

793
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,679
ham and the tuna and the salmon also

794
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,800
added oil so they'll have oil on top of

795
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:27,599
that dense small salad a fatty dressing

796
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,320
once again really dense

797
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,359
small portion their stomach is still

798
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,960
shrunk their stomach's small and the

799
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:39,520
Smoothie is already beats out anything

800
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,720
they've had all day as far as size and

801
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,200
then the salad properly done where you

802
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,679
have lots of lettuce a decent Siz bowl

803
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,560
of spinach three or four

804
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,919
tomatoes cucumber steamed brussel

805
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,680
sprouts steamed potatoes steamed red

806
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,400
potatoes steamed sweet potatoes steamed

807
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,760
asparagus or raw asparagus chopped up

808
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,240
and thrown on top raw onion on there

809
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,520
squeeze of lemon orange juice squeezed

810
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,160
on top of the salad all of this way too

811
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,359
much and if they only ate a little bit

812
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,640
of this meal a little bit of that salad

813
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,400
with all those fixings on it and just a

814
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,320
little bit they would be starving it

815
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,119
wasn't going to meet the caloric nature

816
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,839
of the dense caloric Foods the small

817
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,240
caloric dense fatty meals that they eat

818
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,839
and what they're used to eating their

819
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,880
whole life so they'll need to eat more

820
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,720
of the salad they'll have to learn how

821
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,359
to stretch their stomach even if it's

822
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,920
just a little bit so they could have

823
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:48,720
more of these Healing Foods now even if

824
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,359
it was just a salad that had tomato and

825
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,319
cucumber on it it would definitely not

826
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,280
be enough calories for them they would

827
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:57,359
be starving they would be looking for

828
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,440
sugar somewhere they'd be going to their

829
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,800
famous treats that they usually do and

830
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,520
this is why I like the avocado it's a

831
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,440
transition food it's a great food to

832
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,200
transition somebody who has a shrunk

833
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,480
stomach from eating dense small meals

834
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,760
their whole life but yet needing foods

835
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,040
that are juicy and vital to heal but

836
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,240
can't quite make that transition the

837
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,560
avocado is a great way to do that so

838
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,359
they have their small salad and then we

839
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,200
put an avocado on that salad avocado has

840
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:31,480
that dense nature and if you do have a

841
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,760
little bit of steamed vegetable or

842
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,640
steamed potato or steamed sweet potato

843
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,119
the combination of a little bit of that

844
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,760
steamed potato and the avocado and

845
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:44,280
anything else that's in there with the

846
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,760
lettuce becomes much more denser because

847
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,440
you have that fat slick on that salad

848
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,480
something there so ingrained that

849
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,920
they've known about in their diet system

850
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,400
their whole life having that dense fat

851
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,280
or that oily dressing or that cheesy

852
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,400
topping you treat the avocado as if it

853
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,359
was an egg that's how you get by that's

854
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,160
how you use it as that transition for

855
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,240
them it feels like it was almost like an

856
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,880
egg or something it was almost like

857
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,319
something dense and fatty as you're

858
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,280
working on making your salads bigger

859
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,960
more leafy greens more Tomatoes more

860
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,200
cucumbers or a bigger smoothie in the

861
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,079
morning or more fruits or just a half a

862
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,760
papaya and eating the whole thing or one

863
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,000
or two big mangoes you work on getting

864
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,599
that volume in you that's filling up

865
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,960
your stomach stretching the stomach a

866
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,839
little bit and gently it may not feel

867
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,599
comfortable you may be confused at first

868
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,520
but it's allowing more calories of the

869
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,040
healing foods so they don't run scared

870
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,200
run hungry think they intuitive Natures

871
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,240
off thinking they're not doing balance

872
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,560
or moderation right and then running

873
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,800
into a snag finding some Trend out there

874
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,520
going in opposite direction never

875
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,880
healing and getting stuck this is where

876
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,040
the details matter because I've seen

877
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,440
people out there they were sick and they

878
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,119
had to find a way to heal and then when

879
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,359
you taught them about hey here's the

880
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,839
smoothies here's the bananas here's the

881
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,720

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,760
you get a call from them and they'll be

885
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,680

we have to have more calories you got to

904
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,760
put more banana in you in the morning

905
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,240
more papaya in you get the smoothie and

906
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,680
you maybe your salad can have some

907
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,000
avocado on it let's do a whole avocado

908
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,880
and even that

909
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,319
they'll be like a whole avocado a whole

910
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,359
one okay that's kind of a lot and what

911
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,800
they don't realize is that even if they

912
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,119
went back to their small dense meals

913
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,160
with their stomach being shrunk and

914
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,599
their small intense high fat high

915
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,960
calorie little meals they'd still be

916
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:49,760
looking for all their sugary treats all

917
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,880
day long in between their pieces of

918
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,079
chocolate and their sugar and their tea

919
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,480
and any kind of other treats and snacks

920
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,560
maybe small amounts of it but they would

921
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,880
still be looking for those little bits

922
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,960
of sugar high in and out of it so either

923
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
way they need their calories somewhere

924
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,680
and so we have to find them in good

925
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,599
places like the steamed potato and the

926
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,079
fruit and the winter squash but we have

927
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,440
to stretch the stomach a little bit more

928
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,240
than what they're used to now don't get

929
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,119
confused when I say stretch the stomach

930
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,880
you might think why do I want to look

931
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,560
bloated why is this guy trying to

932
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,880
stretch my stomach I I don't want to

933
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,000
like have a stomach sticking out it

934
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,359
doesn't work like that doesn't mean just

935
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,359
because you're stretching your stomach a

936
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,680
little bit internally it doesn't mean

937
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,800
your abdomen is going to be sticking out

938
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,800
and reaching out not at all it'll just

939
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,960
look the same it'll be the same flat

940
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,440
stomach if you have a flat stomach now

941
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,920
if you don't have a flat stomach you

942
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,040
already got bloating that's a different

943
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,520
story you're already bloating stretching

944
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,520
your stomach has nothing to do with you

945
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,160
bloating more or bloating less if you're

946
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,240
bloating that's another problem that's

947
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,280
other issues that's already happening

948
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,280
and that's going to be there and if

949
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,040
you're already bloating you already have

950
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,520
all kinds of other things like low HCL

951
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,640
low hydrochloric acid which is why what

952
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,520
you're doing with your diet is so

953
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,880
helpful because this takes you to a

954
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,440
place to eventually fix and correct that

955
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,000
problem but a lot of people are bloating

956
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,040
because they have strepto coctus

957
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,520
bacteria inside their gut they got

958
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,119
ammonia they got putrifying proteins

959
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,599
from years and years of food they've

960
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,440
eaten that didn't digest well they got

961
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,040
liver problems stagnant sluggish fatty

962
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,560
livers they're bloating for a whole

963
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,680
bunch of other reasons and stretching

964
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,560
your stomach a little bit to get some

965
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,040
Healing Foods in to fix everything isn't

966
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,000
what's creating that bloating now let's

967
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,839
talk about the opposite side of the

968
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,480
spectrum an expanded stretched stomach

969
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,880
now we're we're not talking anymore

970
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,119
about a shrunken stomach from small

971
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,520
condensed meals and the stomach shrinks

972
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,040
and gets small we're talking about a

973
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,800
stomach that gets big talking about an

974
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:14,280
expanded and stretched stomach this is

975
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,240
from somebody eating larger portions and

976
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,599
it doesn't have to even be that much

977
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,839
larger but larger portions of the same

978
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:23,800
condensed meals instead of one drumstick

979
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,200
they want two drumsticks every night

980
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,319
they want four drumsticks they want four

981
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,400
four drumsticks and two chicken wings or

982
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,319
instead of two slices of pizza they want

983
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,079
half of a large pizza instead of two

984
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:40,400
slices of a medium pizza or say it's

985
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,200
somebody that wants a macaroni and

986
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,319
cheese but not just a bowl of macaroni

987
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,400
and cheese they go in for their second

988
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,599
bowl and their third bowl and their

989
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,280
fourth Bowl because they want a big bowl

990
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,480
of macaroni and cheese and so that's how

991
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,800
they do it or maybe a big bowl of pasta

992
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,119
instead of a small bowl of pasta or when

993
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,240
they make scrambled eggs they don't do

994
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,359
two scrambled eggs or one scrambled egg

995
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,640
they do six scrambled eggs you know and

996
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,760
so what they're used to are large dense

997
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,680
portions of the same foods and then they

998
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,760
still need their treats and their sugary

999
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,880
treats and their chocolate and maybe

1000
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,720
they need a lot of food because they've

1001
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,240
had a hard time feeling satiated

1002
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,960
something in their mind meaning wasn't

1003
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,280
connecting to something physically in

1004
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,680
their brain they needed more calories

1005
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,640
they needed more glucose they needed

1006
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,640
more calories because they're going

1007
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,680
through some hard times they're

1008
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,200
struggling they're under stress their

1009
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,319
adrenals are running they had a hardship

1010
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,000
they had a loss maybe they're being

1011
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,720
abused maybe they were betrayed and the

1012
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,319
need for more fuel came in or they're

1013
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,720
working so hard or they have a little

1014
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:00,480
bit of insulin resistance they're not

1015
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,520
getting enough glucose to the brain so

1016
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,160
they're just requiring more but either

1017
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,559
way their stomach is stretched they're

1018
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,079
used to eating larger condensed meals

1019
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,599
condensed fats but larger

1020
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,079
portions and they're even gaining weight

1021
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,559
and they don't even have to gain weight

1022
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,359
maybe it's somebody that didn't gain

1023
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,760
weight but they're still eating this way

1024
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,000
and then there's somebody who gained a

1025
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,480
lot of weight and they're eating this

1026
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,640
way I know people that eat larger

1027
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,440
portions of condensed Foods they've been

1028
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,680
raised is to eat and eatting their whole

1029
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,800
life but they eat larger portions

1030
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,359
because they're up against so much

1031
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,920
stress hardship or losses or they've had

1032
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,359
a hard time in their life they're under

1033
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,960
stress and they're taking care of a

1034
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,440
bunch of people they're working really

1035
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,559
hard maybe they have two or three jobs

1036
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,359
they're not sleeping much at night

1037
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:49,000
they're working a lot of hours a day

1038
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:50,839
sometimes seven days a week so they

1039
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,559
require more and there's people that

1040
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,440
aren't working that hard don't have a

1041
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:59,200
really hard time but they're requiring

1042
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,400
more too because they need it for fuel

1043
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,520
for their brain because they have other

1044
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,599
issues their brain has other problems so

1045
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,720
it's not like someone wants to eat large

1046
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,640
portions they may be eating larger

1047
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,480
portions because of other issues and

1048
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,119
it's what they've adapted to in order to

1049
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,559
survive and let's just say this person

1050
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,119
gets sick the person who's eaten larger

1051
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,040
portions their whole life and they have

1052
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,160
a stretched stomach or even just a

1053
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,240
little bit more stretched stomach than

1054
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,400
someone with a shrunken stomach and they

1055
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,400
get sick and they need to find healing

1056
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,680
and you give them a salad with a

1057
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,200
cucumber and a tomato on it and a slice

1058
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,200
of potato or something or you give them

1059
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,559
a smoothie and it's just two bananas and

1060
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,040
some wild blueberries they're going to

1061
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,920
look at it and be like well I might need

1062
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,599
more than this they're not going to do

1063
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,680
the opposite of the other person who

1064
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,520
said oh this is way too much I can't eat

1065
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,079
a whole banana a lot of people who have

1066
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,280
stress stretched stomachs get derailed

1067
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,359
when they're eating Healing Foods when

1068
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,359
they're trying to bring in these healing

1069
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:08,599
techniques and healing Tools in food and

1070
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,559
they derail because it's not enough for

1071
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,160
them so you have to be like look you

1072
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,599
need to eat more calories you need to

1073
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,720
eat more because you used to eat these

1074
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,400
dense meals but these larger dense meals

1075
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,079
and your stomach stretched so you have

1076
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,960
to make sure we do more we do a few

1077
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,680
bananas in your smoothie with your water

1078
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,720
blueberries have some apples later on in

1079
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,400
the morning or you might have to bring

1080
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,359
in more steamed potatoes not just one

1081
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,400
little steamed potato and that happens

1082
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,880
to a lot of people where they just start

1083
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,040
with this little steamed potato they're

1084
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,319
used to eating more larger portions of

1085
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:48,200
dense cooked meals with lots of fat in

1086
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:50,800
them but when you say hey look have

1087
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,559
steamed potato you take a look and they

1088
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,680
just put a little tiny steamed potato

1089
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,000
they chopped it up they threw it in

1090
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,760
their salad and they're like oh my God I

1091
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,599
was okay for a little while and then I

1092
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,480
got really hungry because they needed

1093
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:06,960
two or three potatoes or four steamed

1094
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,359
potatoes is what they needed now steamed

1095
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,920
potato if anybody needs to know right

1096
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:15,200
now it's a healing tool it's a healing

1097
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,040
food I talk about it all the time so

1098
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,640
it's not that we're against animal

1099
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,280
protein in the moment it's not one of

1100
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,559
those shows where no animal protein or

1101
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,640
know this and know that we're talking

1102
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:29,520
about healing cleansing healing Foods a

1103
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,079
steamed potato is a very healing food

1104
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,480
there's no fat there's no overt fat

1105
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,040
right there so you don't have to worry

1106
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,559
about all this fat inside of it so in

1107
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:42,280
order to heal a lot of people need to

1108
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:45,800
lower their animal fat consumption just

1109
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,680
like vegans need to lower their nut fat

1110
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,960
consumptions and oil fat consumptions in

1111
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,000
order to heal as well so it's all in

1112
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,040
that field what's hard with somebody

1113
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,880
with a stretched stomach is that they're

1114
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,000
used to those larger amounts of calories

1115
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,559
the chloric action the dense fats so

1116
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,559
when you dial it back you have this

1117
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:11,119
other food now it's not as high in

1118
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,240
calories it's not as dense in fat so

1119
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,119
then we have to eat a little bit more of

1120
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,800
these foods which could leave them

1121
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,760
feeling unsatiated like hungry so they

1122
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,960
go to bed a little bit more hungry than

1123
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,280
usual and they're not used to that it's

1124
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,440
foreign to them they were on 10,000

1125
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,200
calories a day now they're on 3,000

1126
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,280
calories a day and they're confused or

1127
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,200
they were on 5,000 calories a day and

1128
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,720
now they're on 3,000 calories a day or

1129
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,920
2,000 calories a day depending on how

1130
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,200
sick they are what's really wrong with

1131
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,319
them too so that's another thing to

1132
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,720
equate into this but usually there's

1133
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:52,599
people they don't know it but even

1134
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,760
though packages and calorie counts are

1135
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,599
certain ways if you look online or

1136
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,319
anything they're not not accurate so

1137
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,400
none of those calorie counts are

1138
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:04,480
accurate when it comes down to dense

1139
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,280
caloric or dense fat foods people don't

1140
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,440
realize nuts are more calories and more

1141
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,920
dense in fat than people really know so

1142
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,720
how many grams of fat or how many grams

1143
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,760
of whatever people don't realize that

1144
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,160
there's more to it than that and it's

1145
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,839
not quite correct some people walk

1146
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,160
around eating 10,000 calories a day

1147
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,680
8,000 calories a day but don't know they

1148
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,359
met that level in the health World alter

1149
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,559
native Health world it's one siiz

1150
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,160
fits-all if you haven't noticed out

1151
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:34,520
there here's a prime example of how it's

1152
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,200
one siiz fits-all when you look at

1153
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,079
chicken and you say well how many

1154
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,359
calories are in 2 ounces of chicken how

1155
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,240
much fats in 2 ounces of chicken and you

1156
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:48,280
look it up they're just looking at 2

1157
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:53,000
ounces of chicken but they're not

1158
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:55,720
looking at 2 oz of whose chicken what

1159
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,119
chicken right the conventional world an

1160
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,680
alternative World they work together I

1161
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,079
don't know if you noticed it either

1162
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,720
they're both embed together it's all one

1163
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,079
size fits all here's the example a

1164
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,440
chicken in one Farm could be raised

1165
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,520
entirely different and have a much

1166
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,240
higher fat content much higher calorie

1167
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,079
content a chicken in another Farm could

1168
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:22,119
be really lean could even be lean and

1169
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:24,359
mean lower fat lower calorie but no

1170
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,960
one's ever looking at this they just

1171
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:30,079
look at the rec book how it's

1172
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,760
institutionalized for alternative

1173
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,319
medicine believe it or not where you go

1174
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,520
and you look fact check oh 2 ounces of

1175
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:40,040
chicken equals this and this and this

1176
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,720
but that's not reality people walk

1177
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,319
around eating a lot of calories and a

1178
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,799
lot of fat they don't even realize

1179
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:51,040
they're eating that's why you can be

1180
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:54,400
tanking down 6 7,000 calories a day

1181
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,079
8,000 calories a day and not even know

1182
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,720
because theck chicken you could be

1183
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,640
eating from the Farms you're going to

1184
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:04,839
eat them at could be really really high

1185
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:09,040
in fat same goes for any food that's how

1186
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:12,920
strange it is fish same thing eggs same

1187
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,240
thing cheese same thing no one has the

1188
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:19,920
right number so if we're all about like

1189
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,880
it's got to be science it's got to be

1190
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,720
scientific even a study so that means if

1191
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,599
a study itself is doing something where

1192
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,799
they're

1193
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:33,920
studying like the amount of fuel a mouse

1194
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:36,079
needs they're not even equating to what

1195
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,240
the mouse is even eating like the

1196
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,359
science is never straightforward it's

1197
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,240
never really factually right it's not

1198
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:48,160
it's because we go by the one size fits

1199
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:51,640
all world it's never exact so when a

1200
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,760
bodybuilder or exercise buff or trainer

1201
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,799
is counting calories counting macros and

1202
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,079
they're really trying trying to keep

1203
00:51:55,799 --> 00:52:00,319
track and they're portion controlling

1204
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,760
and they're counting everything they're

1205
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:06,079
not even counting anything right because

1206
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,920
they're using the one siiz fits all

1207
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,799
ruler the one that says here's exactly

1208
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,319
how many calories are in a banana but

1209
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:14,640
there's different bananas from different

1210
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,640
Farms from different regions that have

1211
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,359
entirely different things in them and

1212
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,079
then there's different chickens from

1213
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:23,079
different places around the country and

1214
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,799
around the world there's different pork

1215
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,480
there's different lamb there's different

1216
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:28,920
beef there's different eggs there's

1217
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,000
different cheese there's cheese that's

1218
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,480
very thin it's got less fat in it more

1219
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,240
sugar in it and there's cheese that's

1220
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,000
all fat but they're not counting any of

1221
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,839
that and all those things matter greatly

1222
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,720
how was the cow fed there's grass

1223
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:48,119
growing in regions that have less

1224
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:51,359
protein in it there's grass that grows

1225
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,599
in regions of the world that have less

1226
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,599
fat in it traces of fat yes that are in

1227
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,559
grass and so cow are eating differently

1228
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,920
their meats designed differently so when

1229
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,240
we do the one size fits all thing it's

1230
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,960
completely distorted in all wrong so

1231
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,200
nobody knows really how many calories

1232
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,440
they're even eating which leads to a

1233
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:14,079
problem because they could be eating

1234
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,760
more calories more fats than they ever

1235
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,400
even knew they think they're counting

1236
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,160
their proteins fats and carbs they think

1237
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,079
they're doing their macros right they're

1238
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,319
counting their macros right but they're

1239
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:28,599
not they're totally Off the Mark you're

1240
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:31,520
Flying Blind this is one of thousands of

1241
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:34,280
mistakes made in the health world if

1242
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,960
you're starting anything healing doing

1243
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,680
healing tools healing foods you don't

1244
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,400
have to do it all at once you don't have

1245
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,640
to do the whole thing throw the kitchen

1246
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,799
sink in there all together get do baby

1247
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:47,440
steps incorporate one thing at a time

1248
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,640
little bit at a time take one day at a

1249
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,480
time be easy on yourself you don't have

1250
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,440
to think oh my God I got to stretch my

1251
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,440
stomach no don't have to even think

1252
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,480
about it but you got to think about this

1253
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,000
though what you're feeling as you're

1254
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,359
doing it got to be easy on yourself

1255
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,119
there because a lot of people they're so

1256
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,200
inflamed in their intestinal tract their

1257
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,200
Vegas nerves are hypers sensitive not

1258
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,960
just their Vegas nerves but little tiny

1259
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,839
nerve endings come off their Vegas

1260
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,280
nerves going to the intestinal tract

1261
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:19,000
lining so that when food's moving

1262
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,720
through your intestinal tract through

1263
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,280
your gut you're feeling it you're

1264
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,280
feeling it massage the walls of your

1265
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,799
intestinal tract which could kind of

1266
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,000
feel uncomfortable if you're somebody

1267
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:33,400
that's highly inflamed so then you're

1268
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,640
like oh wait my food's not digesting

1269
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,680
that banana I ate isn't

1270
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:42,359
digesting um that salad I ate isn't

1271
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,839
digesting and so you kind of get nervous

1272
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:47,040
you don't know if it's working because

1273
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:50,359
you might be somebody that's used to

1274
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,440
bread and butter bread and butter just

1275
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:56,400
kind of moves through you like a sticky

1276
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,200
gummy glue doesn't massage anything you

1277
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,440
might be somebody that's used to eggs

1278
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:04,680
eggs kind of liquidy into a weird liquid

1279
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,880
paste that sits in the middle in the

1280
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,920
intestinal tract and doesn't touch the

1281
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,119
walls of the intestinal tract it doesn't

1282
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,000
massage if you have a banana banana

1283
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:19,040
moves through and gently

1284
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,839
massages because it's working on healing

1285
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,039
the gut so you might feel a banana move

1286
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:27,200
through you a lot of people they'll eat

1287
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:29,599
some papaya and then be like huh you

1288
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,599
know I can kind of feel something

1289
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,359
different I have a different feeling

1290
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,799
inside of me and they're confused at

1291
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:37,440
that different feeling and it might not

1292
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:40,599
even be uncomfortable at all it just

1293
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,640
might kind of make you aware and when it

1294
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:45,760
makes you aware you might get scared

1295
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,599
because you're changing your diet you're

1296
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,119
eating different foods the foods are

1297
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:55,720
actually touching things inside of you

1298
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:59,480
massaging things they fiber everything

1299
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:02,400
the pulp all of it and healing foods do

1300
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,559
things inside of us that help us and we

1301
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,520
end up feeling that they're cleaning the

1302
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:10,799
mess up so these foods are cleaning

1303
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,839
things up they're cleaning all the junk

1304
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,880
in us too they're loosening up pockets

1305
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,520
of bacteria they're moving around

1306
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,319
deposits that were stuck on the walls of

1307
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,359
the intestinal tract and colon that are

1308
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:26,760
putrified and rancid and hardened and

1309
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:29,480
clung to the walls of the intestinal

1310
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,920
tract these healing foods are waking

1311
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,599
things up moving and shifting things

1312
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,119
feeding the nerves that attach to the

1313
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,559
intestinal tract Linings while all this

1314
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,640
is happening healing is happening inside

1315
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,760
the body and it might be scary it might

1316
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,559
be like what's going on I'm kind of

1317
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,920
getting aware of this this is a

1318
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,000
different feeling I feel what is this

1319
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,760
then you might get scared you might be

1320
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,599
like huh I can't tell meanwhile to

1321
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:03,039
toxification cleansing healing purging

1322
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:06,039
of the liver is happening see all these

1323
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,960
things are going on and we can sense

1324
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:10,520
them we could feel them and it can make

1325
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,160
people go the opposite direction

1326
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,400
sometimes because they're used to being

1327
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,599
inflamed and sick but not feeling the

1328
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,480
food move through them instead they're

1329
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,079
used to just being bloated sick maybe

1330
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,920
crampy and constipation maybe IBS and

1331
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,799
other problems but they're not used to

1332
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,000
feeling their food so much this is New

1333
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:34,720
Sensations that happen when you do it

1334
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,119
right when you do it right when you know

1335
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,319
how to use these foods to cleanse when

1336
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,839
you know how to use these foods to heal

1337
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,160
and you understand your stomach how to

1338
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:49,119
protect your stomach and then when you

1339
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,440
bring in celery juice and you can baby

1340
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,359
step that you can start small and not

1341
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,559
have to go to 16 ounces on an empty

1342
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,960
stomach or 32 ounces on an empty stomach

1343
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,359
yet but when you bring in the tools like

1344
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,559
the lemon water and the celery juice and

1345
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,599
the smoothies and the heavy metal detox

1346
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:07,720
smoothie and you bring in your leafy

1347
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,680
greens and you bring in your steamed

1348
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,960
asparagus and steamed brussel sprouts

1349
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,160
and steamed potatoes and your wild foods

1350
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,280
and your herbs and you bring it in baby

1351
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,079
stepping in something changes you end up

1352
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,200
moving forward and you discover and

1353
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:25,920
unlock the healing process in you and

1354
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,160
your consciousness the

1355
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,359
Consciousness that adapted all these

1356
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,720
years to what you used to eat all those

1357
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,920
years ago starts to change and the

1358
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,240
emotional centers of your brain connect

1359
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,520
to the new

1360
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,559
consciousness of your body

1361
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,559
healing and it's the most powerful thing

1362
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,640
you could ever

1363
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,839
do our

1364
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,799
Consciousness is not who we

1365
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:57,920
are because our Consciousness can be

1366
00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:02,359
become something else something we don't

1367
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:04,799
want to be our Consciousness is

1368
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:08,319
powerful but it's not something that

1369
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:10,880
defines us to exactly who we're ever

1370
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:13,799
going to be because we can use our

1371
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,760
Consciousness to change and

1372
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:20,400
grow if someone is living their life and

1373
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,640
they make mistakes along the way through

1374
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:27,319
hardships and hard times and they make

1375
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:30,319
decisions that they believe was not a

1376
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:32,760
good thing they have to be easy on

1377
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:36,520
themselves because our Consciousness in

1378
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:39,359
that moment was only doing the best it

1379
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,400
could with the capacity of what it's

1380
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:45,480
learned throughout the years but we can

1381
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,359
turn to another Direction and our

1382
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,359
Consciousness can grow it can become

1383
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:54,359
something different it can help us make

1384
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:57,680
decisions that's right for our body

1385
00:59:54,359 --> 01:00:01,599
right for our needs and then it becomes

1386
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:05,200
our best friend our best ally not our

1387
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,520
enemy seeds become planted within our

1388
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,880
Consciousness seeds of things that

1389
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,319
aren't good for us seeds of things that

1390
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:18,119
don't make us better they take us down

1391
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:21,520
along the way we get told all the time

1392
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:25,280
what's good for us what we should do

1393
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:28,119
what feels good listen to your body

1394
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,599
and do the things that are trendy out

1395
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:34,400
there the trend train doesn't care about

1396
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,799
really what's going on inside someone

1397
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,400
it's all about making somebody else's

1398
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:42,079
Consciousness happy in a different way

1399
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,880
but we can take control of our own

1400
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:48,280
Consciousness and we can lead it into a

1401
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,559
direction of safety and well-being for

1402
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,240
what we truly need instead of our

1403
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:58,000
Consciousness filled with noise and busy

1404
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,559
work words controlling us we can retach

1405
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,039
and Infuse knowledge and wisdom into our

1406
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:07,359
Consciousness and support the

1407
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:11,079
supernatural resource so it becomes a

1408
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,079
star that lights the

1409
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,480
way
