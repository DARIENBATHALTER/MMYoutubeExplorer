155
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,639
stick a liver in someone someone loses

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,160

161
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,199
emotional

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
instability just so you know I'm just

217
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,280
being straight up it's important to

218
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,879
know anxiety and depression can come on

219
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,039
when the liver gets viral just when the

220
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,599
liver gets viral if that's a new term to

221
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,960
you new understanding just know just so

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,839
a simplex one it sits inside the liver

227
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,320
it sits inside the

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,640
liver that's just one example that's

229
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,000
just one example if you ever had Mono

230
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,320
before it's in the liver it's been in

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,880
the liver your whole

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,800
life didn't know you had Mono no you

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,519

234
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,560
sore throat in college for a week and

235
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,000
slept it off that was mono and it sits

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,519
inside the liver you know it's it's it's

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,959
amazing it's like the liver it gets

238
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,560
filled with viruses bacteria and then

239
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,200
there these viruses end up later on

240
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,320
causing Hashimoto thyroiditis causing

241
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
all these problems and you can protect

242
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,519

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,959
lime disease and everything else but the

247
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,959
liver gets filled with

248
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,959
viruses and these viruses start

249
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,880
releasing

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,920
neurotoxins because they eat food

251
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,560
viruses

252
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,680
feed they feed on food Foods they like

253
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,440
making you want eggs making you want

254
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,480
something to eat

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
cheese because that's what these viruses

256
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,720
feed off of them nobody in the industry

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
knows that by the way and if you heard

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
it somewhere it came from me first from

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
the books and everything nobody knows

260
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,680
that nobody knows that and it's

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,200
important to know that because you need

262
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,320
to know that because you're becoming

263
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,160
that expert right now so you just need

264
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,120
to know you're becoming an expert on

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,600
information that's Advanced that's how

266
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,160
it has to work if you're going to help

267
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,800
somebody become an expert like you guys

268
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,640
you got to at least know the

269
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,000
how advanced the information is so you

270
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,160
don't think it's just sitting out there

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,120
somewhere when you're telling somebody

272
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,200
and then if you hear it out there you

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,760
got to hear it straight and right or

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,360
you'll know that it's been skewed or

275
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,200
thrown off and that happens all the time

276
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,480
so always keep an eye out for

277
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,560
that so anxiety and depression that can

278
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,839
come on you know but that that can come

279
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,920
on and have everything to do with the

280
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,560
liver liver starts

281
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,279
releasing neurotoxins too because the

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,680
liver gets so filled up with neurotoxins

283
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,240
and dermatoxin

284
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,880
like for instance exam and psoriasis is

285
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,320
dermat toxins that's bugs in the liver

286
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,519
feeding off of copper and other toxins

287
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,639
DDT that's been in there you don't think

288
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,839
DDT is in us every eagle has DDT in it

289
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,160
right now every Eagle does what does an

290
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,440
eagle

291
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:55,040
eat um rodents

292
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,480
rabbits anything eagles eat chickens you

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,399
know they just fly right down in a c

294
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,519
grab a chicken fish they eat fish they

295
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,079
scavenge Eagles are like they scavenge

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,120
but why do eagles still have DDT why do

297
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,360
they still have

298
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,920
DDT in them there's not an eagle that

299
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,360
doesn't have DDT in it no there isn't

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,079
there's not a human that doesn't have

301
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,519
DDT in it in

302
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,519
them and that DDT sits inside the liver

303
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,959
gets passed on a generation passed on a

304
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,040
generation it's floating in the air

305
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,000
other countries are using

306
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,760
we're still selling it DDT companies are

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
still selling it just as if everything's

308
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,120
perfectly fine it's just you know when

309
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,760
it's floating around in every other

310
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,240
country

311
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,639
basically still in our country it's

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,040
everywhere it's in the

313
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,560
dirt it's unbelievable it's in houses

314
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,240
it's in the walls of houses it's

315
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,079
unbelievable I mean my

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
God anyway you know liver gets filled

317
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,399
with that pesticides everything else

318
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,480
gets it gets overloaded these things

319
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,920
feed V viruses prescription

320
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,079
drugs I mean everything antibiotics they

321
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,560
start releasing oxidized Metals so that

322
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,519
you know because antibiotics are filled

323
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,240
with metals are filled with petroleum

324
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,399
fills up the liver and all this stuff

325
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,160
goes to the brain short circuits the

326
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,600
brain short circuits neurotransmitter

327
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,600
activity can get somebody kind of

328
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,760
emotional even if it's not considered

329
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,839
depression even if it's not considered

330
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,440
anxiety just anxiousness even if it's

331
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,800
not considered your a diagnosis of

332
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
depression it's

333
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,839
still it's still causing problems goes

334
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,560
up to the brain can even cause

335
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,079
neurological issues these things I talk

336
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,880
about that in thyroid healing of course

337
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,800
and in Liver

338
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,920
Rescue so the emotions that even go with

339
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,360
seasonal effectivess disorder they go

340
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,519
with anything forget SE seasonal effect

341
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,959
disorder just your daily disorder like

342
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,040
your daily being affected by it becomes

343
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,040
you know disorder emotions are like that

344
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,000
emotions that go I mean we all have

345
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,440
emotions it it basically anger

346
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,519
frustration abandonment feeling crushed

347
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,480
forgotten or the like have to do with

348
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,760
your brain being affected by the true

349
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,959
story of what's occurring inside of your

350
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,480
liver and then if you have things that

351
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,519
happen on the outside of you it's like

352
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,160
somebody breaking your heart

353
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,720
relationships somebody stiffing you

354
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,000
somebody backstabbing you somebody

355
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,480
betraying you broken trust all this

356
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,880
stuff if you live on planet Earth long

357
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,880
enough you'll experience some of that

358
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,120
you'll experience some of that

359
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,760
absolutely

360
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,959
basically totally getting bleeped over

361
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,560
you know that happens to so many people

362
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,160
in so many ways and so that's not good

363
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,720
either and that that causes trouble too

364
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,440
because what that does is that causes

365
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,480
adrenaline surges and that's a whole

366
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,600
another section that we're going to go

367
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,760
into on the emotional liver adrenaline

368
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,079
surges surges from outside

369
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,880
sources adrenaline surges from you're

370
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,880
not going to hear this anywhere this

371
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,560
just not I have to repeat that in case

372
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,399
somebody new popped on to the podcast

373
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,920
out of nowhere and there you know you're

374
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,880
not going to hear any of this anywhere

375
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,120
adrenaline surges from being crushed

376
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,639
emotionally or being just

377
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,000
confrontational IED is that a word no

378
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,000
it's not a word that's not a word I just

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,959
made that word up

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,399
confrontation being you know pushed

381
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,480
around anything at work co-workers

382
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,079
friends anything going on any kind of up

383
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,160
and down that you have in your life any

384
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,399
kind of difficult situation that we all

385
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,800
face day in and day out or through life

386
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,000
or once a year or whatever it is

387
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,920
adrenaline gets released saturates the

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,079
liver injures the liver go the

389
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,720
adrenaline goes to the brain but it

390
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,600
definitely goes to the liver because the

391
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,040
liver has to absorb it up to stop it

392
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,680
from going to the heart and the Brain

393
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,160
the best it can but some gets there

394
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:49,160
anyway but the point is the liver is the

395
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,199
mop the sponge for adrenaline

396
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,480
related you know issues from outside

397
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,680
sources of being let down and so forth

398
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,519
and challenged and everything else

399
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,079
adrenaline

400
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,800
is an

401
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:07,839
issue it's very difficult so that's just

402
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,199
one thing that's just one thing and then

403
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,800
our own emotions that occur from a toxic

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,680
liver like I said anger frustration

405
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,000
abandonment you know that feeling of

406
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,040
being crushed forgotten or the like

407
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,639
having to do with everything being

408
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,000
affected by what's in occurring inside

409
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,079
the liver the liver's unhappiness is the

410
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
foundation of our emotional stability

411
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:33,440
I'm going to say it over again I'm going

412
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,480
to say it over again you

413
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,399
guys very important to know and then you

414
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,160
got Mercury inside the liver pathogens

415
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,680
feeding off of mercury creating more

416
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,279
toxins and these toxins being released

417
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
out of the liver and the liver holds as

418
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,319
many as it can until it gets sluggish

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,480
and stagnant and becomes

420
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,279
weak and that's the whole thing there

421
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
too electrical electrical impulses in

422
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,040
the brain can short circuit from all

423
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,759
these toxins that come from the liver

424
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,639
creating more emotional issues and

425
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,360
frustration and anger can arise from a

426
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,600
sluggish pref fatty or fatty liver so

427
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,560
basically your

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
liver is what I'm trying to say is your

429
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,800
liver getting fatty or pre fatty

430
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,360
emotions come from that they arise from

431
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:22,600
that they do and it's a difficult

432
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:27,399
situation the liver starts to lose its

433
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,680
strength as it's fighting for its life

434
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,160
on a daily basis

435
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,040
our livers fight for its own life on a

436
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,360
daily basis so what do we do we throw a

437
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,440
whole bunch of crappy food in there we

438
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,959
do we do all kinds of stuff I got people

439
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,600
complaining about celery juice they

440
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,720
can't drink celery juice 50-year-olds

441
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,000
can't drink celery juice they don't want

442
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,959
to drink it and they got babies on

443
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,199
Instagram toddlers drinking glasses of

444
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:59,440
celery juice is not complaining one bit

445
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,519
got 40y olds 25 year olds 30-y olds 28y

446
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,480
olds can't can't get any celery juice

447
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
down they feel like they're bloating or

448
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,679
they got something going on they just

449
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,640
don't like it because first of all it's

450
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,439
it's gets becomes

451
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
emotional

452
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,520
emotional it becomes emotional because

453
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,559
you're actually hitting the liver with

454
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,959
all that and you're cleansing the liver

455
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,319
it's yeah it could be

456
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,559
hard as you got these babies and are

457
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,799
just drinking down a big glass of celery

458
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,799
juice I swear to God it just blows me

459
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,480
off my seat and that's happening

460
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,360
worldwide it's happening around the

461
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,120
country and everything

462
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,120
else it's it's really funny it's funny

463
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,600
how things work I mean it's the best

464
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,960
thing I've ever seen you know I would

465
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,000
have never dreamed that I had over the

466
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,400
years um I've had moms give celery juice

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,120
their little ones over the years when I

468
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,840
was in practice you know year year after

469
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,919
year seven days a week all day sometimes

470
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,799
throughout the night depending on

471
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,600
emergencies and stuff like that and um

472
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,280
and um there's a lot of little kids and

473
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,159
a lot of kids that that drank celery

474
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,320
juice but when but that's before that

475
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,400
was before you can see it happening like

476
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,320
on the internet now you can see it so

477
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,240
when I see it it just blows me away it

478
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,880
blew me away a long time ago and it

479
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,520
blows me away still

480
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,039
today

481
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,240
so

482
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,880
anyway the liver can become

483
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,159
cranky on its

484
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,640
own and it can even feel disconnected on

485
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,760
its own it's not getting any love any

486
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,559
attention we really do abuse our livers

487
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,640
not because we want to I know you don't

488
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,320
want to I don't want to we don't want to

489
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,840
it happens from misinformation and

490
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,480
disinformation and everything else it

491
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,600
happens from a lot of that trendy stuff

492
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,240
too cleanses that are actually bad for

493
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,080
the liver cleans is just terrible

494
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,440

499
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,360
trendy misinformation out there the

500
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
disinformation is just horrendous

501
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,919
because it gets people in trouble you

502
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,120

see it when you're exercising and

507
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,799
feeling pretty good at 25 years old and

508
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,360
you're trying to lower your carbs and

509
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,799
you're trying to stay off fast food sure

510
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,480
fine but everybody gets older you can't

511
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,200
escape it and and it's all catches up

512
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,799
the liver gets toxic bugs collect in it

513
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,760
you know relationships and all kinds of

514
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,880
things through life and bugs collect

515
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
that go into the liver whatever happens

516
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,679
you're eating in restaurants all the

517
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
time and whatever and you you can pick

518
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,400
up bugs and just what happens is the

519
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,760
liver gets filled up it's gets weak you

520
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,480
start getting bloated you get the hot

521
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
flashes you get the viral symptoms

522
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
everything else that everybody has the

523
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,880
type of thyroid that comes on later on

524
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,559
all these things you can't escape it

525
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,840
unless you do the right things and you

526
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,960
watch what you're

527
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,360
doing and you know what you're doing

528
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,280
that's the whole point so medical medium

529
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,039
series is teaching anybody that so they

530
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,039
can actually stay healthy and

531
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,240
young but the liver gets tired from

532
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:06,600
everything and it gets

533
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,919
emotional it actually gets

534
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,840
emotional and it's a really important

535
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,520
thing to

536
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,799
understand and we have to treat it with

537
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,799
some

538
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,799
respect when the liver gets toxic and

539
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,320
it's holding on to tremendous amounts of

540
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,480
poisons such as get this

541
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,880
radiation oh man the liver holds on to

542
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,559
radiation

543
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,960
trying to protect you number one plus we

544
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,640
get radiation exposure a lot pesticides

545
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,440
herbicides nanotechnology where can we

546
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,159
get nanotechnology it's coming out of

547
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,640
the

548
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,480
sky and I'm not trying to like claim

549
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,000
doomsday I'm just saying we just need to

550
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,400
cleanse our livers properly take care of

551
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,240
ourselves eat the right things and get

552
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,640
rid of our you know symptoms conditions

553
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,280
and learn how to protect ourselves and

554
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,960
learn how to you know help the emotional

555
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,720
liver so we don't become emotional I

556
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,760
mean all of this is this

557
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,280
important is it important I thought it

558
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,000
was really important I put it in the

559
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,480
book it's a little section in the book I

560
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,200
mean the book is so big it's got so many

561
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,559
other things in there to talk about but

562
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,120
I put this in

563
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,960
there you know spirit said to me we need

564
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,720
this I said all right okay all right

565
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,279
well then I said fine I mean I could

566
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,960
have said no but I said all right and I

567
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,279
get it we really really do need it you

568
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,039
know I I have to learn too when the

569
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,799
liver gets toxic and it's holding on to

570
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,120
a tremendous amount of poison such as

571
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,919
radiation pesticides herbicides nanot

572
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,760
technology materials that are on

573
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,919
clothing brand new clothing you name it

574
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,440
fungicides that are on

575
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,679
everything toxic heavy metals what's a

576
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,240
toxic heavy metal mercury lead arsenic

577
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,880
copper nickel

578
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,600
chromium Chrome whatever

579
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,360
anything the whole bit I said nickel

580
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
barium whatever um a whole bunch of

581
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,520
different

582
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,720
things you know bacteria viruses path

583
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,840
pathogenic waste matter like dermato

584
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
toxins like I said neurotoxins some of

585
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,360
these poisons can leech into the

586
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,960
bloodstream and intestinal tract as

587
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,679
you've read

588
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,320
before in thyroid healing and medical

589
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
medium book

590
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,200
one they can cause some of the issues

591
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,919
we've like looked at with everything I

592
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,520
talked about that before

593
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,799
adrenaline though is a really obnoxious

594
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,880
annoying

595
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,960
one because adrenaline get this get this

596
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,960
you

597
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
guys

598
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,559
adrenaline is released when we go

599
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
through a hard

600
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,320
time it's released with regular things

601
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,840
too or a good time but it's released

602
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,880
with hard

603
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,440
times it is when it's released with hard

604
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,159
times it has information in it

605
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,799
information stored in it because there's

606
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:02,159
over 56 blends of a adrenaline science

607
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,440
and research has no idea 56 Blends the

608
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,159
adrenal subtle Blends from being like

609
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,600
going through a hardship or a breakup or

610
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,039
whatever it is whatever it is whatever

611
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,640
hard time it is a

612
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:18,360
loss and that adrenaline has information

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,400
in it released at the time when a

614
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,279
certain time happened in your

615
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,240
life the liver Sops it all up absorbs it

616
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:29,880
all

617
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,880
up and takes on that information

618
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,679
and that that can build up over time if

619
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,520
a lot of stuff is intense and going

620
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,640
through your life and you're not

621
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,240
cleansing and take care in your liver

622
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
that's one of the things also adrenaline

623
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,720
scorches and weakens the liver but the

624
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,080
liver is doing that to protect your

625
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,200
brain your heart the whole bit the liver

626
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,640
is trying to protect your butt that's

627
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,320
trying to protect

628
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,919
you mind-blowing isn't it mind-blowing

629
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,000
information that's in Liver Rescue mind

630
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,000
blow it blows my mind it blew my

631
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,720
mind fasten your seat seat belts got

632
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,200
more to come it's really intense gets

633
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,840
actually pretty

634
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,520
crazy when that adrenaline gets trapped

635
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,159
in the liver the liver tries to trap it

636
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,440
in fat

637
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,440
cells yeah and when your liver gets

638
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,760
sluggish and lazy and it's been through

639
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,679
hell and you're eating high fat diets or

640
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,320
anything else the liver starts taking on

641
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,240
more fat adrenaline gets set not only

642
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,799
saturated in liver tissue can get

643
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,399
saturated in liver liver fat

644
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,080
cells

645
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:32,120
whether it's in liver fat cells or just

646
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,200
living liver tissue that adrenaline that

647
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,039
happened during a hard time or a loss or

648
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,679
a breakup or a divorce or a problem or a

649
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,320
stressful time in your

650
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,520
life when it needs to be released

651
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,880
because the liver decides to release

652
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,399
it you know like when you know breakups

653
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,279
betrayals being stabbed in the back this

654
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,399
information's in that adrenaline and

655
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,159
when it gets

656
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:59,399
released it goes through the

657
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,600
body and creates it's emotions that are

658
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,600
unexplainable you can't really tap into

659
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
it or touch it but it's there can get

660
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,000
somebody down depressed sad at the end

661
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,960
of the day without even realizing

662
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,520
it it's powerful stuff that

663
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,000
happens your liver wants to prevent you

664
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,640
from becoming Intoxicated by adrenaline

665
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,960
this is a steroid that races through

666
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,440
your bloodstream messes you up and

667
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
during these traumatic moments your

668
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,080
liver becomes so nervous and even scared

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,760
for your

670
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,039
life and get ready for

671
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,399
this it releases a hormone undiscovered

672
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,120
by research and science they'll Discover

673
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:41,679
it maybe in 50 years or 40 years

674
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,799
whatever it is I don't even know if I'm

675
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,120
if we're even lucky if I'm even lucky

676
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,880
they've already discovered some things

677
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,880
that I put out years

678
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,279
ago yeah heard it here first though

679
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,279
Discovery was here

680
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,320
first your liver becomes so nervous and

681
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,159
even scared for your life it releases a

682
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,120
hormone that's undiscovered like I said

683
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:06,200
by science and research that draws

684
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,760
excess adrenaline into the liver so the

685
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,120
organ can sop it up to protect you from

686
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,840
stroking out from neurotransmitters

687
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,640
being totally burned out from the

688
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,080
experience and even from Hemorrhage or

689
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,360
anything of the

690
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,159
sort the liver can soak up excess

691
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,039
adrenaline from the bloodstream during

692
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,240
bouns of intense stress and other

693
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,840
adrenal

694
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,039
triggers it's only a temporary solution

695
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,159
but still the liver is doing this over

696
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,880
time it must release its adrenaline

697
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,039
stores bit by bit because it has no

698
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,840
choice and even when you're cleansing

699
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,399
it'll release it which will make you

700
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,200
feel weird during your cleansing and

701
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:50,039
detoxing totally emotional can make you

702
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,360
feel really emotionally unstable when

703
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,559
you detox but people do different

704
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,520
cleanses and detoxes and water fasts and

705
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,000
whatever and Juice fasts they get

706
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,720
emotional because this is the stuff

707
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,440
that's coming out but nobody knows or

708
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,039
has a clue no one you're hearing it

709
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,279
first ever

710
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,279
here over time it releases this

711
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,559
adrenaline that's right bit by bit so

712
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,799
the kidneys and the intestinal tract can

713
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,320
try to be prepared to release a new bat

714
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,440
so you could be be prepared to get rid

715
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,799
of it as each new batch is coming in

716
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,799
even gets released out of your

717
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,399
armpits as the adrenaline leaves you'll

718
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,039
experience the information stored the

719
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,039
hurt the hurt

720
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,640
stored

721
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:41,640
nostalgic almost surreal in a

722
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,559
way even if the adrenaline was from a

723
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:50,200
month ago 6 months ago a year ago 5

724
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:52,559
years ago 10 years ago 15 years

725
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,919
ago you'll feel a little bit of loss

726
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,519
maybe some frustration maybe even a

727
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,519
crapload of anger

728
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,159
so this liver of ours tends to release

729
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,120
its storage bins of

730
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,320
adrenaline with even the change of the

731
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,720
seasons a little spurt here a little

732
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,679
spurt

733
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,559
there when your liver took this

734
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,200
adrenaline originally it released that

735
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,399
it was released during your emotional

736
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,399
trials and

737
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,399
tribulations it also took on and held to

738
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:28,519
your emotional experience that's what

739
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm trying to tell you the liver took on

740
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,960
and held on to your emotional

741
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,559
experience experiences too experiences

742
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,559
too

743
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,159
okay that's really

744
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,159
important its release of this can

745
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,559
trigger the same painful experience and

746
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,960
feelings you had when the adrenaline was

747
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,440
first

748
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,000
released at a time of struggle because

749
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,519
it holds this emotional

750
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,519
Essence as the liver lets go you let

751
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:12,039
go so I

752
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,559
mean this is important

753
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:18,600
information and it's important because

754
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,640
you may be feeling lost when you feel

755
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,320
emotional not no but the irony is you go

756
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,480
to a you go to a psych and you go to

757
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,960
whatever and you go to a you go to a you

758
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,960
know whatever psychoanalyst psychologist

759
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,919
whatever it

760
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,120
is

761
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,840
psychiatrist and you know I mean they

762
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,799
just try their best but they won't know

763
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,080
that this is happening they just don't

764
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,480
so I mean it it's good that you know so

765
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,279
many people feel lost and they don't

766
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,000
even know why and the liver has

767
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:54,640
everything to do with it that's the

768
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,640
irony liver has everything to do with

769
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,600
it so the liver keeps a

770
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,679
record it's unbelievable it keeps a

771
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,640
record of what's

772
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,640
happening it keeps a record of

773
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,080
everything and you can feel extra

774
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,159
emotional as you get toward the end of a

775
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,880
calendar year too just as adrenaline

776
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,960
that's released on the liver schedule is

777
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
attached to emotions liver on a schedule

778
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,919
as well it's amazing how the liver works

779
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,919
the

780
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,000
adrenaline the adrenaline that's

781
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,080
attached to toxins that the liver is

782
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,559
forced to let go can bring out emotions

783
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,120
too so you can have adrenaline attached

784
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
to a

785
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:44,279
toxin any kind of toxin inside the

786
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,480
liver or you could have been at a

787
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:52,000
funeral at one time 8 years ago you ate

788
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:54,880
a ham sandwich to wash down your

789
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Sorrows all this time your brain has

790
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,440
stored away the memory within its data

791
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,320
database and your liver is that database

792
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,320
and brain in this

793
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,760
situation your liver has stored the

794
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,000
emotional information along with the

795
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,799
cheap hams ammonia nitrates and other

796
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,320
preservatives that you ate at the

797
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:23,039
funeral and cheap fat or unhealthy fat

798
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,080
in the pork that it neutralized and took

799
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,159
on to protect you so your liver absorbed

800
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,159
it and took it on to protect you

801
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,480
I mean this is the power of the liver

802
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,720
what it does and the memory it has too

803
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,720
it's

804
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,399
incredible you can feel that when that

805
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,360
ham sandwich starts detoxing out of your

806
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,000
liver along with the adrenaline

807
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,279
too you can feel that sorrow again and

808
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,840
not even pinpoint where it's coming

809
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,919
from not even know where the grief is

810
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,840
coming from you can be consumed with

811
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,080
grief for a time and not even know why

812
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,760
as it traveling through your

813
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,159
bloodstream that's just one of hundreds

814
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,519
of examples of when that ham sand Sam

815
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,440
Sandwich starts to come out of that

816
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,559
liver with the experience this being at

817
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,799
a funeral as an example and eating that

818
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,919
ham

819
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:18,360
sandwich our bodies are complicated but

820
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,480
simple Simplicity meaning that if we

821
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,600
take care of them give them what they

822
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,399
need you wouldn't believe what they'll

823
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,039
do for you you wouldn't believe what

824
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,399
your body will do for you if you don't

825
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,799
know what it needs then we get in

826
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,720
trouble because if we don't know we

827
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,240
don't

828
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,039
know and that's the whole point of why I

829
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,760
wake up in the morning it's why when I

830
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,840
was age four and spirit started talking

831
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,639
to

832
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,159
me and I took spirit's information which

833
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,159
was just as advanced when I was 5 six

834
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,360
seven 8 years old as it is now it's all

835
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,000
the same Spirit would still tell me the

836
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,720
same didn't mean I had to understand it

837
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,639
but I can still I can still recite it as

838
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,919
if I was in a play in a play or

839
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,760
something trying to listen to my lines

840
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,639
or read my lines spirit was giving me

841
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,600
the lines to say didn't matter how

842
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,200
advanced it was about neurotoxins didn't

843
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,000
matter how advanced it was about 60

844
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,320
varieties of viruses it doesn't matter

845
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,360
how advanced it was i''d be 6 Seven 8

846
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,200
years old just talking just saying it

847
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,600
all as organized as the liver tries to

848
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,080
stay with different

849
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,720
compartments and store different toxins

850
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,320
in every place inside the liver because

851
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,320
the liver stores so many different

852
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,440
toxins in so many different areas it has

853
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,360
storage Banks and it and it's B do you

854
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,279
ever ever been to a

855
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,600
dump and you know scrap metal and all

856
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,559
this other stuff there I mean I don't

857
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,279
know if you've ever been to one you know

858
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:42,440
when I was a kid we lived near a dump

859
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,919
you know it was kind of close enough and

860
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,399
you know it wasn't good either because

861
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,200
you got all that mercury and you got all

862
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:49,240
that bad stuff just lead and everything

863
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,639
else just leaking from rain water just

864
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,279
leaking down into the Earth you know was

865
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:58,519
always concerned being kind of living

866
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:02,120
near that close enough but but the

867
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,360
bottom line is I remember going to the

868
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,200
dump and you know family would bring

869
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,359
some garbage go to the dump or something

870
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,200
like that and you I'd walk through and

871
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:16,200
back then it was it's not like now you

872
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,079
know as a kid literally walking through

873
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,119
like a dangerous area unbelievable and

874
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,240
and you can see like one pile had all

875
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,280
these wash machines and

876
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,359
dryers see you or something microwaves

877
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,839
wash machine dryers and all that

878
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,040
something like that one pile one pile

879
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,280
had all these like

880
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,879
bicycles you know bicycle frames and all

881
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,119
this other stuff one pile had all this

882
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,839
like toilets and sinks and all that you

883
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,560
know you know another another had like

884
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,520
bottles and crap just like it was all

885
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,839
that kind of stuff oh wa and another pot

886
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,639
would be like

887
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,800
couches it was crazy and know probably

888
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,960
would be like couches and mattresses

889
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,079
yeah I don't know if you've ever

890
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,920
experienced anything like

891
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,359
this yeah anyway you know I'd see all

892
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,760
that and I remember I'll never forget

893
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,440
Spirit saying to me I was 8 years old

894
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,240
and spirit said to me as I was standing

895
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,839
there waiting for my dad to you know do

896
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,839
his thing and drop off garbage or

897
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:22,520
whatever it is and spirit said to me

898
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,119
this is like your liver right here this

899
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,920
garbage dump I said my liver personally

900
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,680
Spirit Well your liver is not so bad cuz

901
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,000
we've been working on it you know Spirit

902
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,440
would always tell me how to eat a little

903
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,880
bit better and everything else at that

904
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,640
young age I do do the best at my

905
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,520
capacity then whatever was

906
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,520
available but spirit said no this is

907
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:47,920
this is the human liver right here

908
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,920
wow so it's like I was amazed because I

909
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,119
was getting it I was starting to

910
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,599
understand it more and more not just

911
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,640
hearing the information to be able to

912
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,599
tell somebody hey look you got you got

913
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,599
this thing in your liver and you got

914
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,119
these spots in your liver I see that

915
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,960
spirit's telling you about and that you

916
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,640
know all that and and you know and doing

917
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,960
the scan and all that that Spirit taught

918
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,119
me to do but it was I was sitting there

919
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,319
and it was like a revelation it was

920
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:19,520
almost like oh my God it was

921
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:22,280
serious and what it was what it was was

922
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,200
I had this realization I saw it this was

923
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,640
the liver it was starting to hit me wow

924
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,119
everybody's liver is polluted

925
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,520
and spirit said you see that pile of

926
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,319
scrap metal over there those are heavy

927
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,960
metals they're all in the liver of

928
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:40,839
somebody and the liver tries to actually

929
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,079
put them in compartments even separating

930
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:47,040
them if the liver can and it will it

931
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,880
will try because it'll do everything it

932
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,680
can and then spirit said you see those

933
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,520
piles of cans over there cans and and

934
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,480
all that and Bottles the bottle caps and

935
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,359
all that

936
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,880
and I said yeah all those cans and all

937
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,240
those different cans and all that

938
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,000
there's petrochemicals in those cans

939
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:12,000
those are all aerosol cans and solvents

940
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,520
inside of them and empty solvent cans of

941
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
you know of of oil degreasers and

942
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,920
carburetor cleaners and all these

943
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,400
different

944
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,720
things and those are all petrochemicals

945
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,280
and solvents and they go in a different

946
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,480
area of the liver a deep core of the

947
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,040
liver and in that pile you see m old gas

948
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,280
cans everywhere the metal ones some of

949
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,319
them still having a little bit of

950
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,200
gasoline at the bottom all piled up in a

951
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:39,680
big Heap ready just to ignite if

952
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,240
anything those old

953
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,760
dumps and spirit would say and you see

954
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,599
that pile over there and I said what and

955
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,000
spirit said and that pile over there the

956
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,680
furniture and the beds it's all from

957
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Malahide that's all you know outgassing

958
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:59,160
materials and chemical Laden you know uh

959
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,880
uh Petri chemicals too and different

960
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,800
kinds of solvents different kind of

961
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,680
falah hdes and everything all sitting

962
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,760
there and I got it and I got it I

963
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,040
understood at age eight how the liver

964
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,319
works and how it stores everything and

965
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,680
how it stores

966
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:20,359
everything yeah and then spirit said

967
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,839
this which blew my mind as an

968
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,680
8-year-old and I didn't forget it I

969
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,160
didn't forget this

970
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,599
one and spirit said

971
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,000
these are all

972
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,920
possessions all these things you see in

973
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,040
here that are piled up bicycles the wash

974
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,040
Machines Car Parts all this kind of

975
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,160
stuff and they have emotions attached to

976
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,240
them people attach themselves to

977
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,800
possessions of course emotions are

978
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,480
combined into that it might be a bicycle

979
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,280
somebody first got as a gift for a first

980
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,760
birthday it might be or a birthday it

981
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,920
might be a couch that a husband bought a

982
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,640
wife for an

983
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:08,000
anniversary it could be

984
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:11,319
anything in the pile that was in there

985
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,680
could be wash machine a wash

986
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:18,040
machine that you know washed a whole

987
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,640
bunch of bedding from somebody that was

988
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,280
that passed

989
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,720
away it could be a mattress that you

990
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,119
know there was good times on the

991
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,520
mattress of of of a couple together

992
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,680
Partners husband and wife or whatever

993
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,560
and also could be bad times being sick

994
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,480
spirit said and having a stroke and

995
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,000
laying in the bed for a long

996
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,720
time there's emotions even in all of

997
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,760
this and spirit taught me then that the

998
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,720
liver is filled with emotions along with

999
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,720
toxins that even come from these

1000
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,960
possessions

1001
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,440
here if feel laid in a bed and there's

1002
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,040
some faldh coming up which you can detox

1003
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,520
and heal yourself from I mean it's all

1004
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,920
good not trying to scare anybody you can

1005
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,440
lay in your you lay in the bed and you

1006
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,960
got these toxins coming

1007
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,280
up and it happened during a

1008
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,680
time yeah it stores in the liver and it

1009
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,680
could get released and there could be an

1010
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,960
emotional connection to

1011
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,440
it it's that

1012
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,680
intense it's that unbelievable the liver

1013
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,640
is just an unbelievable mechanism of

1014
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,880
some kind unbelievable organ gland and

1015
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,280
whatever you want to call it whatever

1016
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,160
science of research wants to call it I'm

1017
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,680
cool with that science research thinks

1018
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,760
it has 500 chemical functions try again

1019
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,800
it's got over

1020
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,920
2,000 it's got over 2,000 Spirit taught

1021
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,880
me that

1022
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,800
too did Spirit teach me all 2000 no my

1023
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,160
head would blow up it would just explode

1024
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,920
and I I can't go through that but I sure

1025
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,839
as heck put hundreds of undiscovered

1026
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,880
ones in this book live or

1027
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,440
rescue hundreds of U undiscovered

1028
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,000
chemical functions in Liver

1029
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,839
Rescue but the bottom line

1030
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,640
is is I was just completely blown away

1031
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,480
as I stood there at 8 years old hearing

1032
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,280
all this so the liver put compart has

1033
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,800
compartments of these stored poisons of

1034
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,160
all these different stored things that

1035
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
we go through and memories and things

1036
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,200
and bad and good and everything else

1037
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,240
it's all piled in this heap of garbage

1038
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,400
discarded

1039
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,079
unbelievable

1040
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,480
and so that blew my mind when I left the

1041
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,960
dump that day with my dad with my father

1042
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,680
I left the dump that day I was just

1043
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,680
completely taken

1044
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,599
back completely taken

1045
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,000
back and you know what's really crazy

1046
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,880
that day that happened I'm going to tell

1047
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,319
you right now since I'm just being a

1048
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,640
little bit

1049
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:53,920
emotional me and my dad were walking out

1050
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,400
of that dump and it was an old one had

1051

1053
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,680
and we were walking out of

1054
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,560
there and I looked on the ground and

1055
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,200
something shiny was on the ground and

1056
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,319
yeah there's bottle cap shiny there's

1057
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,359
flip tops there's all kinds of garbage

1058
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:11,760
aluminum foil everywhere Just Junk I

1059
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:15,720
looked down the

1060
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,079
ground and there was a quarter on the

1061
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,800
ground

1062
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,640
1942 and it was silver so I didn't know

1063
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,000
it was silver until spirit said it was

1064
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,119
silver and I said well what do you mean

1065
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,400
it's Silver Spirit said that's a silver

1066
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,240
quarter that's not clad that's not you

1067
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,160
know that's not

1068
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,440
nickel it's not copper it's

1069
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,640
silver and I picked it up it was

1070
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,640
1942 and my dad said hey that's an old

1071
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,359
coin I said wow was all beat up and

1072
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,160
spirit said that's

1073
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:55,160
silver Silver's anti

1074
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,880
viral silver is a different kind of

1075
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,480
metal

1076
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,760
and silver kills

1077
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,119
pathogens and sometimes Silver's you

1078
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,760
know

1079
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,200
sometimes sometimes I mean over the

1080
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,599
years it's it's important to take a

1081
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,160
little bit of the right kind not not not

1082
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,119
the not the wrong kinds there's wrong

1083
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,040
kinds out there but they remember being

1084
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,079
blown

1085
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,359
away by

1086
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,960
that and spirit said not all metals are

1087
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:25,079
bad not all metals are bad cuz Spirit

1088
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,160
was teaching about all the toxic heavy

1089
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,319
metals

1090
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,319
and spirit said that there's going to be

1091
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:34,119
some Silvers down the road where people

1092
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,200
can actually take a little for a sore

1093
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,599
throat take a

1094
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,440
teaspoon for a sore throat to kill off

1095
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,440
strep strep a cockus and I heard that at

1096
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,200
8 years old walking out of the

1097
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,599
dump unbelievable that just blows me

1098
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,119
away I know it's off topic a little bit

1099
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,200
but when you're dealing with viruses

1100
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,960
strep and pathogens especially strep too

1101
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,640
and eoli all that it sits inside the

1102
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,599
liver it sits inside of Staff it sits

1103
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,880
inside the Li liver SEI sits inside the

1104
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,559
liver all these different bugs

1105
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,359
everywhere funguses and everything else

1106
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,160
bad funguses that it's all store inside

1107
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:07,920
the liver and everything and then when

1108
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,240
they come out or we get a bad sore

1109
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,520
throat we get a tons lights viral

1110
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,480
infection you know teaspoon of the right

1111
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,400
kind of silver can really really move

1112
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,599
people

1113
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,760
forward take a little bit of that once

1114
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,359
in a while but it just blew me away that

1115
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,280
information at 8 years old

1116
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,200
anyway it was a great day that day cuz I

1117
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,079
had the window inside the liver and I

1118
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,160
was able to tell people all the time

1119
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,440
about the emotional end of it all it's

1120
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,559
really

1121
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,640
powerful you know you know the liver and

1122
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:45,680
it's miscellaneous storage

1123
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,640
area it just it it gets bombarded at the

1124
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,920
same time with our high fat diet that's

1125
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,520
what really bugs me and it's it's just

1126
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,079
everywhere and the trend is just high

1127
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,960
fat high protein which is high fat by

1128
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,920
the way high protein don't get fooled by

1129
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,880
that and it's just it's amazing what

1130
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,720
happens it gets bombarded by Fats too

1131
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,040
it's a whole another thing and do you

1132
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,319
know what fats do and the reason why

1133
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,599
have to tell you this the more fats you

1134
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:09,280
eat in your diet the more adrenaline has

1135
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,800
to be dispersed out of the adrenal

1136
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,200
glands and more epinephrine more

1137
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,599
adrenaline cortisols everywhere it's got

1138
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,240
to actually be dispersed to try to thin

1139
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,680
out the blood so the fats don't give you

1140
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,960
a heart attack on a daily better daily a

1141
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,720
daily level a daily level they got to

1142
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,640
remember that so lowering your fats is

1143
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,480
so important you can listen to the other

1144
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,079
shows about the liver and everything

1145
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,760
else and you'll hear about that how you

1146
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,880
how to do that and all

1147
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,359
that trying to take in and process all

1148
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,319
these fats the best it can our liver it

1149
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:46,079
will throw in

1150
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:48,200
items like the

1151
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,800
troublemakers from a funeral reception

1152
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,040
the ham sandwich hairspray from a

1153
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,359
prom that went bad you know air

1154
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,200
freshener from a waiting room or you

1155
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:02,880
were awaiting bad

1156
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,599
news chemically treated fire pitted wood

1157
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,280
and excess alcohol from a cookout where

1158
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,720
your relationship broke up and even

1159
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,920
little bits of

1160
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,839
adrenaline the liver is not being sloppy

1161
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,200
and throwing them all together it's

1162
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:18,680
being efficient it throws all these

1163
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,200
together and stores them inside the

1164
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,720
liver and it releases them all together

1165
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,839
out and when we bombard the liver with

1166
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,760
high fat diets we trap it in

1167
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:34,520
longer so and sometimes

1168
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,559
sometimes the fat itself that gets

1169
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,480
trapped in the liver absorbs all of this

1170
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,160
and holds it on for a lifetime until you

1171
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,160
start working it

1172
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:48,559
out it's amazing how it

1173
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,839
works basically the liver's goal is to

1174
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,760
use chemical functions to sort out all

1175
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:54,800
this miscellaneous pile that I talked

1176
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,480
about at the dump

1177
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,400
site sort it out and categ categorize it

1178
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,200
can't say that word right

1179
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,200
today most people aren't on track to

1180
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,680
give the liver the break it needs most

1181
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,240
all people are not on track to give it

1182
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,520
the break it

1183
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,440
needs we leave it to be alone like a

1184
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,800
lone wolf a

1185
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,720
worker a worker at the dump instead of

1186
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,760
teaming up with it because we don't know

1187
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,920
otherwise

1188
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,480
and you know what when I was at that

1189
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,079
dump when I was 8 years old there was a

1190
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:36,079
whole bunch of people working it wasn't

1191
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,760
one person it was like a whole bunch of

1192
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,359
guys piling up garbage here driving a

1193
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,720
truck over here dumping garbage here

1194
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:44,400
pulling something out of here doing this

1195
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,839
bringing things here another truckload

1196
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,359
it was like a whole massive team of

1197
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,480
people but guess what your liver's only

1198
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,559
one one person your liver's only one

1199
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,760
thing one Lone Wolf doing it alone

1200
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,720
that's why we need to help it to help

1201
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,720
our emotional

1202
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,480
abilities so organizing this

1203
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,280
miscellaneous pile is last on the

1204
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,440
liver's to-do list and that's another

1205
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,599
problem it often doesn't get to

1206
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,040
it when it comes time to purge which

1207
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,880
you'll know in liver 369 in this book so

1208
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,480
you can get rid of the emotional

1209
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,720
instability it's time to purge you make

1210
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:26,240
room for

1211
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:28,599
more it's this pile that gets emptied

1212
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,680
out comes that ham sandwich that I

1213
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:32,200
talked about at the funeral out comes

1214
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,280
that miscellaneous

1215
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:39,440
junk the the liver wants to toss out and

1216
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,400
out goes Cravings along with sorrow

1217
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,079
Cravings can happen too you can get you

1218
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,640
start craving and that's it and you

1219
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,960
won't be able to trace back to anything

1220
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,280
you won't be able to trace back to

1221
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,680
anything anytime you detox you guys

1222
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,400
whether in a healthy way endorsed by the

1223
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,200
liver which this book's about

1224
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,680
out and this book's endorsed by the

1225
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,359
liver when it's forced to empty some of

1226
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,839
its miscellaneous storage bin I talked

1227
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:08,599
about that dump site to make room for

1228
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:12,079
anything else in the moment emotions can

1229
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:16,319
come up as the toxins leave it happens

1230
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:22,079
both during the liver's stress bomb time

1231
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,079
that is the NeverEnding indulge in

1232
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:27,920
Buffet basically what's happening is you

1233
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,720
know the liver has emotions too it's

1234
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,440
just doing the best it can to run the

1235
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,079
whole show in there and it's by itself

1236
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,880
just like we do the best we can when

1237
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,520
we're sitting somewhere and we end up

1238
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,079
eating things we're not supposed to eat

1239
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,760
and we're stressed out and we're tired

1240
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,520
and it's the only resources we got in

1241
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,200
front of us and everything

1242
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,599
else

1243
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,599
unbelievable how it

1244
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:51,839
works

1245
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:54,520
Cravings are serious I mean you may

1246
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,119
crave a honey baked ham double bacon

1247
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,640
cheeseburger

1248
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:01,200
I mean you may crave

1249
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,599
pizza but your body's not telling you I

1250
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,960
need protein and your liver is not

1251
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,720
telling you I need protein and your

1252
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,559
liver is not telling you I need iron and

1253
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,559
protein no it's

1254
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,440
not the best way to handle these

1255
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,760
Cravings that even happen on emotional

1256
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,720
level when when all this is going on the

1257
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,559
best way is to not to give it to them

1258
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,760
not to give into to them I mean sorry

1259
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:27,200
about that not to give in to them and

1260
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,160
instead we got to opt for that celery

1261
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,559
juice opt for those steamed potatoes

1262
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,079
without butter on them without fats on

1263
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,280
them opt for sweet potatoes without oils

1264
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,839
on them opt for and if you you know I

1265
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,760
mean do the best you can opt for some

1266
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:45,400
butternut squash steamed butter baked

1267
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,559
butter not squash why not do baked

1268
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,160
butter opt for bananas banana ice cream

1269
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,599
opt for so many recipes that are in The

1270
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,680
Liver Rescue book and so many other

1271
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,440
books of mine you know opt for all these

1272
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,440
other options

1273
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,079
yeah yeah if you have to opt for a

1274
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:03,880
little avocado sh if you have to opt for

1275
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,079
something else sure I mean sure but try

1276
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,160
to opt for some of these other ones some

1277
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,880
of these other

1278
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:13,000
things I know leafy greens aren't

1279
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:15,839
comforting I know but they sure as heck

1280
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,160
fix your liver I know celery juice isn't

1281
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:22,119
comforting I know it's not I mean some

1282
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,720
people say it is I mean I feel it is but

1283
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,720
it fixes your

1284
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,720

00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,599
don't have to you know avoid that it

1339
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,920
