00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,120
decades ahead what's out there now this

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,559
is the only Health show where the

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,600
information here doesn't come from

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,160
interest groups or medical funding with

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,760
strings attached botched research

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,280
lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,079
belief systems private panels of

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,320
influencers and health field payoffs are

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,719
trendy traps that are both in

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,559
conventional and alternative medical

20
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,960
community's

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,039

Clean Source a higher source the spirit

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,400
of compassion there's nothing more

26
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:14,520
healing than compassion so who has 10 or

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,920
20 years to wait for answers we have to

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,960
start our healing now we need every

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,360
answer we can get now and as a child

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,000
when the gift first came to me to hear

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,159
Spirit perfectly clear and spirit

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,240
appeared and gave me information for my

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
grandmother and for other people for the

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,040
rest of my life and gave me that ability

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,799
to see when that first happened Spirit

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,479
was saying people need these answers

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,479
they need them now cuz I always asked

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,520
all the time I always said well why you

39
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,119
know who cares who cares you know when I

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,880
was a kid I was like who cares I I you

41
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,119
know I can't be bothered with this I

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,479
just want to ride my bicycle I just want

43
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,240
to do things I want to have fun I don't

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,399
want to know what's going inside of

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,479
people and what's going inside in in in

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,280
them and what's happening and that's

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,240
what I would say to Spirit spirit said

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,960
you have to care you have to learn to

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,520
care at a young age I had to tap into

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,840
that I had to root into that and care

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,640
about other people meaning truly care

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,680
about other people people I didn't know

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,840
people that I never really knew people

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,040
that you know strangers I had to root

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,360
into that it had to it had to become

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,080
ingrained in me toare because we need

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,239
this information and spirit taught me

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,440
that this information was really

59
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,200
important for people to know and as I've

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,040
seen over the Decades of doing this

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,480
being a servant to Spirit and to the

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
people and the communities and

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,360
everything else as I've seen I've seen

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,200
the changes I've seen the Miracles I've

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,159
seen what's happened with spirit's

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:50,560
information and spirit was right right

67
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:53,239
all along so hey Today's Show is about

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,480
inflammation this is an important show

69
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,800
it really is inflammation is is

70
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,400
something that we need to talk about for

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,440
a lot of reasons it's one of my favorite

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,560
words in a way because it's it's an easy

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,319
word to use like for for instance okay

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,280
you guys the mistake is not trying to

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,840
fix inflammation because you know I'm

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,280
always always looking for mistakes it's

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,760
not trying to fix inflammation or trying

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,159
to relieve inflammation or watching out

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,920
for it because there's some mistakes

80
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,519
with inflammation and I'm going to I'm

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,120
going to let you know what's going on

82
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,040
with it it's it's it's a word we throw

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,200
around so liberally we just throw it

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,480
around we you know a lot of

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,879
practitioners throw it away well you're

86
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,959
inflamed well it's got to be some kind

87
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,280
of inflammation well you know there must

88
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,280
be some inflammation there you know

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,720
maybe hey look it looks like you're

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,799
inflamed you know whatever the MRI might

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,640
show hey you have some inflammation in

92
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,599
here wherever we use the word it hurts

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,480
there's pain so well you're inflamed you

94
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,840
know there's some pain there so yeah

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
there's there's it's probably some kind

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,680
of

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,480
inflammation and so that's a word we

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,720
kind of throw around but it's a lazy

99
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,280
term hey I've used it I even use it I

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,000
mean you know I I I'll use it it's a

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,919
lazy term it really is and I'm going to

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,759
tell you why it's a lazy term and and

103
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,040
what's going on with that I mean you're

104
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,080
probably figuring that out right now um

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,280
but so it's it's not it's okay to use it

106
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,880
because we want to relieve inflammation

107
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,639
we want to be looking out for it we do

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,520
we want to we want to look out for it

109
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,160
and we want to try to fix it and we want

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,240
to care about that we do want to care

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,560
about that come on we want to try to fix

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,600
inflammation we know that but we do use

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,400
it as a lazy term because I'll tell you

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,840
why we use it as a lazy term and I'll

115
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,639
tell you why it's not good I'll tell you

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,280
why it's not good to use it like we do

117
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,000
because inflammation

118
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,840
is not something that's a lone wolf it's

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,680
not something that appears on its own

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,240
okay it's not something that just

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,160
evolves and appears like magically just

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,840
you know or

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,759
curse I mean a curse whatever right I

124
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,000
mean it's not it's not something that

125
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,440
just develops it's not a lone wolf okay

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm trying to paint the picture here I'm

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,319
trying to paint the picture here for you

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,639
instead it's it's a sign okay it's a

129
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,160
sign but there's there's a problem here

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,400
okay there's a problem think about this

131
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,639
for a second okay here's the problem you

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,199
know

133
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,960
inflammation is not an answer it's not

134
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,960
an answer I'm just telling you right now

135
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,240

not it yeah yeah of course there's

148
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,440
inflammation there but that's not it am

149
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,039
I being a little too silly today is that

150
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,560
what's happening so listen it you know

151
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,599
that's not the

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,680
answer right right so you know that's

153
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,120
the whole point oh you know my gut I

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,759
don't know what's going in my gut

155
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,759
there's something going on there um you

156
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,080
go to a practitioner well you know

157
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,120
there's inflammation in there oh okay

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,680
that's what it is I'm inflamed all right

159
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,879
okay no that's not what it is it's not

160
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,280
the answer so inflammation as answer is

161
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,919
equals wrong which equals big mistake

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,440
actually it's one of the great mistakes

163
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,960
one of the great mistakes you know I

164
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,479
talk about great mistakes it's important

165
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,879
to really just know those but you know

166
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,080
and I go into great detail great detail

167
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,919
about inflammation that I'm not even

168
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,120
going to cover today I go in great

169
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,360
detail in uh the thyroid healing book

170
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,520
that I can't even there's no way to

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
cover all that that thing's so packed I

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,479
can't even I can't even go there in a

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,160
show but but the bottom line is is that

174
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:36,520
you know it's not the answer it's not

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,599
aone wolf it's mysterious it's

176
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,759
mysterious and to the medical community

177
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,160
is alternative conventional it is a lone

00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,840
wolf it is and it's a mysterious Lone

179
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,560

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
mysterious there's there's something

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,360
behind the mystery there's answers

182
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,879
behind the mystery there's there's

183
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,680
reasons see

184
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,000
inflammation

185
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,680
occurs from two things two things just

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,159
two can you believe it we have the human

187
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,720
body we have the human body your body

188
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,560
right our bodies right we have that and

189
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,800
look what's going on millions and

190
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,520
millions and millions and hundreds of

191
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,840
millions of

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,080
functions thousands and thousands and

193
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,639
thousands of chemical

194
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,280
functions per cubic inch of the physical

195
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,519
human body scien research hasn't tapped

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,519
into any of them okay and and all that

197
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,680
going on all that mystery all that

198
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,800
mystery I mean my brain Burns to the

199
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,920
ground when I start going into a asking

200
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,600
question war with Spirit when I start

201
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,519
doing that when I start saying you know

202
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,320
if I'm saying if I'm if I'm feeling kind

203
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,560
of fresh if I'm feeling kind of fresh

204
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,680
and I want to torture myself and I'm up

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,120
for torturing myself and torturing my

206
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,720
brain and and exploding it I'll just go

207
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,519
you know I used to do it a lot more with

208
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,839
Spirit but right now I just do it for

209
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,440
the books I do it for the books I try to

210
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,480
I try to you know I try to pull as much

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,640
truth as I can out of spirits much

212
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,240
unbelievable information that's

213
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,240
incredible for our healing to move us

214
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,320
forward on this planet advaned

215
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,959
information and I and to for the books

216
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,079
and I I I burn my brain out just just

217
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,680
asking Spirit of zillion questions and

218
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,720
getting and then you know and going on a

219
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,800
spirit's on a tangent with information

220
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,560
that's just too much for me and you know

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,880
what happens is and you know when I'm

222
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,800
doing that when I'm doing that spirit

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,600
will be like well this organ has this

224
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,040
many chemical functions and these are

225
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,839
some of the chemical functions and it's

226
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
like too much it's like oh my God I

227
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,399
can't even believe that that that that

228
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,360
will be in that will be in textbooks

229
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,519
down the road hopefully if science gets

230
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,600
there 500 years from now but the point

231
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,480
is the amount the body is doing the

232
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,839
amount the the body is

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,839
doing is is so vast and what's happening

234
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,519
but guess what there's only two

235
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:14,240
things two groups of of

236
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,519
things that cause inflammation can you

237
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
believe that right that's simplistic

238
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,440
spirit said to me there's two things I

239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,279
said there can't be two things because

240
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,079
I've talked to you uh uh thousands of

241
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,279
times spirit in my life and you you the

242
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,720
the human body is way too complex when

243
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,800
we even go to the brain you know with

244
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,240
what's happening with the different

245
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,720
varieties of heavy metals and how they

246
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,920
group and how they create Al Alo and how

247
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,279
they interact with each other with radio

248
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,079
signals and all kinds of stuff things

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,079
that nobody knows about nobody knows in

250
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,360
the health field Spirit tells me about

251
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,839
and how can there be just two things for

252
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,440
inflammation and spirit said there is

253
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,639
there's injury I was like oh okay so you

254
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,200
mean you bang yourself or car crash or

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,720
you know you hit your elbow the other

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,800
day boy my knee my knee hit the corner

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,120
of a chair the other day I got to tell

258
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,880
you guys that was that Lit it right up I

259
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,600
was just like wow that was I was I was

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
really walking quick I had a piece of

261
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,200
paper in my hand I was walking quick I

262
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,240
was trying to get around to the office

263
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,720
and banged my knee on a real you know

264
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,920
uneasy chair sticking out so hey here's

265
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,200
the deal so injury is one so you

266
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,839
everybody's had some form an injury

267
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,600
right no matter what it is Sports Injury

268
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,279
exercise injury um you anything anything

269
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,240
you could be walking along and twist

270
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,320
your ankle could be walking along I've

271
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,720
done that I've done that remember years

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,000
ago I was just

273
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,560
walking um and and you know wasn't

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,399
thinking I was just you know was just

275
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,880
listening to Spirit was totally into

276
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,519
What Spirit was saying you know I was I

277
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,320
I walked off of a curb kind of twisted

278
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,560
my ankle a little bit was like geez PE

279
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,920
you know you can and I've seen people

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,720
really who have come to me that have

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,120
they've Fallen you know really hard you

282
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,200
can injure yourself ice forget it ice

283
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,920
that's a whole another game every winter

284
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,000
I hear it all the time every single

285
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,120
winter people like just break

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,320
their break their butts and you know

287
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,600
here's the deal that's that's one way to

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,120
get inflamed and the other one is

289
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,480
there's only other there's only one

290
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,079
other only one other and you're going to

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,120
say how can that be this is this is

292
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:37,199
what's really cool here how can that be

293
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,199
where it's just one other when you know

294
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,760
there's this other practitioner or

295
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:44,000
doctor or expert says that you know this

296
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,000
food can inflame you and this food can

297
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,560
inflame you and this causes this and

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,399
this causes this and we're going to air

299
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,959
that out no there's one other thing and

300
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,519
it's an Invader it's an

301
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,120
Invader an

302
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:04,360
Invader okay that's the other

303
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:09,079
inflammatory maker too that's it human

304
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,360
body is so so darn complex with so many

305
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,079
chemical functions and so much going on

306
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,040
it is utterly utterly insane and you

307
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,959
know two things for

308
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,160
inflammation okay injury sure you can

309
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,120
injure yourself in hundreds of different

310
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,519
ways but injury or Invader and there's

311
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,000
hundreds of different different Invaders

312
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,440
that's right hundreds of different

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,760
Invaders but it's two things so so

314
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
here's the deal though you know you tell

315
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,720
somebody else that you know you tell say

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,120
uh you know you tell a hip doctor that

317
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,639
that's you know totally in alternative

318
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,639
medicine conventional mix and they're

319
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,199
doing great things totally respected

320
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,199
absolutely I know a whole bunch of

321
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,240
amazing people in the industry and

322
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,440
people I don't even know and they'll say

323
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,560
no no you know wheat wheat causes

324
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,000
inflammation that inflames you um you

325
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,240
know certain foods uh can inflame

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,279
people no no not at

327
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,240
all see wheat gluten gluten itself

328
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,399
doesn't inflame you what gluten does it

329
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,000
feeds something it feeds something that

330
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,560
inflames you it feeds an Invader and

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,560
that is not out there now and what

332
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,320
little is is because I've I've killed

333
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,040
myself to try to get that out there in

334
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,920
every way

335
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,959
possible and that's how it

336
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,440
works it's important to know I mean I

337
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,519
know people in their 80s I mean the crap

338
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,480
they eat I can't I mean I can't even

339
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,079
tell you maybe you know somebody I mean

340
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,480
they're eating pound cake for God's

341
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,040
sake or whatever they're eating you know

342
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,839
cupcakes I'm not talking about like a

343
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,079
brand muffin which still is loaded with

344
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,680
God knows what in in so many cases

345
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,240
talking about cupcakes you know

346
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,480
cupcakes right with fondant on top or

347
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,040
whatever you call that

348
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,199
stuff you know and and I mean they're

349
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,920
fine they're not even in I look at them

350
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,639
I can't find inflammation in them I

351
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,959
can't find inflammation unless they

352
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,360
twist their hip or something they're 85

353
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,440
and they bang their you know back

354
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,880
against something they fall they you

355
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,319
know then I see the inflammation but

356
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,959
I've had you know people at 80 years old

357
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:34,440
people at at 70 years old people at 90

358
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,319
over the years I'm not talking about a

359
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,000
lot of them but they've had them and I

360
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,959
mean they're eating chocolate cake I'm

361
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,199
talking like just horrible chocolate

362
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,639
cake you you know in a

363
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:49,480
restaurant not talking about some kind

364
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,759
of holistic restaurant or health food

365
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,000
store that's got a somewhat of a healthy

366
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,399
chocolate cake that's still got coconut

and and and the icing or whatever it is

370
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,360
that's that's bad the point is is that

371
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,000
talking about the real bad stuff just

372
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,240
lar just Pig lard

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,800
and just and God knows what okay

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,920
chemicals and everything right I'm sure

375
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,480
you guys have you know tried your fair

376
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,560
share over the years of some something

377
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,759
like that but the point is the

378
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,880
inflammation is not off the chart is

379
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,160
very little very little existing and

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,720
some people have seen and it's like you

381
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,360
just shake your head you shake your head

382
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,360
and you say to Spirit well what the hell

383
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,839
is going on here and spirit says well

384
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
that they're missing something I said

385
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,600
what are they missing they're missing an

386
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,959
Invader or they're missing an

387
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,240
Invader that is doing something that's

388
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,120
you know you know real dormant Invader

389
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,279
hasn't even come out it's just not even

390
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,319
coming out to play so it won't even

391
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,959
create inflammation it's so dormant

392
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,759
or they're missing an Invader completely

393
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,280
I've run across a couple of people what

394
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,319
am I talking about Invader talking about

395
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,799
pathogen pathogen I like the word

396
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,600
Invader now because when I say pathogen

397
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,600
people are like what what's that

398
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,559
pathogen you know I run across that a

399
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,000
lot well I could totally get it pathogen

400
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,839
is just a weird I don't know like who

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,079
knows what a pathogen is it it's crazy I

402
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,439
was even talking to a friend I haven't

403
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,160
talked to years I was like yeah well you

404
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,919

you're dealing with I said is a pathogen

406
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,480

and they said what's a

408
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,799
pathogen I said an

409
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,600
Invader and he said an Invader what do

410
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,240
you mean and

411
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,640

could you to run across people that

413
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,960
don't have it they could eat all the

414
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,880
gluten they want they could eat bread

415
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,720
they could have sourdough whatever right

416
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,559
and and and they could have

417
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,360
baguettes with fet of cheese on it like

418
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,840

fish stick um know chicken fingers in

431
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,400
some you know terrible restaurant

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,960
terrible restaurant or fast food

433

restaurant chicken

434
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,159
fingers the point is is they could eat

435
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,520
this stuff yeah sure sure sure there's

436
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,400
other things in that food that could

437
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,320
eventually tip something off like create

438
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,720
the worst

439
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,640
worst kidney stone ever the worst gall

440
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,520
stone ever yeah and I see that in these

441
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
people say sure I'll see an 80-year-old

442
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,799
that has a whole pile of

443
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,400
stones he Stones

444
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,039
everywhere all right because they've

445
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,640
been eating that that chocolate cake

446
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
they've been eating those cupcakes with

447
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
that crazy fondant on there they've been

448
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,280
eating whatever and you know and they

449
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,840
got those big big stones and sure maybe

450
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,120
that stone hasn't aggravated that that

451
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,400
gallbladder by trying to get stuck in

452
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,799
the duct remember that's an injury

453
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,360
that's an

454
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,840
injury the gall stone gets just stuck in

455
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,760
that gallbladder there and it's jammed

456
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,919
in the duck

457
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,640
that's an injury that's not an Invader

458
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,640
so then inflammation starts that's an

459
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,320
injury that's an internal

460
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,559
injury okay that's an internal

461
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,240
injury you see

462
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,640
and my annoying today or what with this

463
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,360
inflammation thing it's just it's it's

464
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,880
fun to talk about inflammation but it's

465
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
not fun to have it I'm going to tell you

466
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,520
right now I've seen people so inflamed

467
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,039
it's

468
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,039
heartbreaking and and it and and it can

469
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,440
it can injure the soul it hurts so much

470
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,679
it hurts I've be seeing people suffer

471
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,520
and we're going to go into some

472
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,559
different kinds of inflammation so you

473
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,120
you get you kind of get what is going

474
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,640
on so when it comes down it's it's this

475
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,200
catch all we throw around it's just

476
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,760
catch all word we throw around now in

477
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,799
the industry we just throw it around but

478
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,840
it's not the answer so important to know

479
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,679
what's going on so if you got something

480
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,760
like a knee surgery you had because your

481
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,360
knee wore out

482
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,440
and it wore out so you got a knee

483
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,520
replacement but you're not

484
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,200
recovering and the doctor doesn't know

485
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,200
why and they're thinking about going in

486
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,840
there again and doing some work the

487
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,880
surgeon is thinking about going in there

488
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,679
again and doing some work and it's just

489
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,200
not calming down nothing's

490
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,600
happening that's because something else

491
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,039
is happening in the body and then you

492
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,679
get somebody else meaning like meaning

493
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,559
somebody else might just get a you need

494
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,120
replacement they're perfectly fine

495
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,000
nothing going on they're walking in 3

496
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
days and healing really quick the other

497
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,799
person has 6 months of recovery and it's

498
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,320
swelling all the time that's from

499
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,520
having an Invader in the body too so the

500
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,240
Invader was most likely there putting

501
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,880
inflammation that was chronic on the

502
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,080
joint to begin with on the knee joint to

503
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
begin with which then led to the the

504
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,919
knee to wear out cartilage bone on bone

505
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,840
metal on metal we call it like the brake

506
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,960
system on a car and then knee

507
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,000
replacement occurred but no one fixed

508
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,200
the

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,200
pathogen The Invader that was in the

510
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
body which is normally Epstein bar when

511
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,880
that happens with knee Replacements and

512
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,960
hip replacements and people don't

513
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,840
recover quick enough and it takes time

514
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,200
and but that's what I mean that's how it

515
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,679
works giving you kind of a kind of a you

516
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,320
know quick rundown of different ways

517
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:48,640
that's happening so inflammation alone

518
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,559
is a great mistake but the mistake is

519
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,679
not trying to fix inflammation even

520
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,919
though mistakes are made trying to fix

521
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,360
inflammation all the time the mistake

522
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,080
isn't made relieving it even though

523
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,080
sometimes mistakes made relieving it but

524
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,080
no it's still we're watching out for it

525
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,559
the mistake is using it as an

526
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,919
answer it's a lazy lazy

527
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,080
term but I'm trying to you know give you

528
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,159
truth trying to give you truth truth

529
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,600
that's not tampered with truth that's

530
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,840
clean I have to say that a lot now you

531
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,000
someone said to me the other day are you

532
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,200
really going to say this at the

533
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,039
beginning of your

534
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,559
shows about the clean information versus

535
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,919
you know inflammation that's been you

536
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,520
know with strings attached and all this

537
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,279
other all this other crap and all this

538
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,760
stuff are you really going to say this I

539
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,880
go yeah because people don't realize it

540
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,840
people I had somebody actually say

541
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,320
something to me a while back and say oh

542
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
oh your information you're in your show

543
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,240
I mean you're probably just picking it

544
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,279
up from everybody else there's more

545
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,240
advanced in no it's not true that's not

546
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,480
true that's not true that stuff's

547
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,120
contaminated most of it is anyway

548
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,080
because of because of funding funding

549
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,760
has to go into it when funding goes into

550
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,919
it the outcome has to turn out a certain

551
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,360
way or you going to pissed off your

552
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,320
investors and that's how health

553
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
information is created both alternative

554
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,640
alternatively

555
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,400
conventionally um and and chronic

556
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,760
illness especially chronic illness

557
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,120
especially that's what I mean and so

558
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,320
let's talk about these Foods so you talk

559
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,080
to somebody and they're like no no there

560
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,440
there's foods that can inflame you no

561
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,600
there's foods that will feed a pathogen

562
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,080
to cause more

563
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,960
inflammation that's what's going

564
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,640
on like for you know Celiac and the gut

565
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,480
or anything there's different kinds of

566
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,480
inflammation in different places

567
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,360
and you know let's cover some of it all

568
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,520
right you you're with me on this you got

569
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,679
hey did you fasten your seat belts got

570
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,640
to say it again terrible I got to always

571
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,039
say it I know did you your seat belts

572
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,240
there's different kinds of inflammation

573
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,360
you ready brain

574
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,720
inflammation brain

575
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,120
inflammation it's easy to get different

576
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,880
kinds of brain inflammation and nerves

577
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,600
in the brain that go to the brain and

578
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,279
run down through the body those nerves

579
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,200
can get inflammation neural neurological

580
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,919
inflammation that's nerve

581
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,200
inflammation different nerves can be

582
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,880
inflamed from

583
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,279
pathogens pathogens heavy metals

584
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,480
technically don't inflame something they

585
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:21,760
feed a pathogen or Invader to inflame

586
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,400
something because heavy metals is a food

587
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,520
had another practitioner a long time ago

588
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
um because I'll never forget this I

589
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,080
think it was about I don't know a year

590
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,640
ago or something over a year ago so it's

591
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,080
quite a while back and this practitioner

592
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,440
said to me you know heavy metals cause

593
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,919
inflammation I go no heavy metals feed

594
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,399
they have to feed something to cause

595
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:46,039
inflammation they're like I just it it's

596
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:49,320
it's this is important information from

597
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,080
Spirit that we have to know I I you know

598
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,720
having everybody in the dark too long

599
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,159
it's just it's getting too painful I'm

600
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,000
getting older it was cute and fuzzy and

601
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,799
fun when I was younger and thought I'd

602
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,080
live forever

603
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,720
okay I thought I'd live to be 500 years

604
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,039
old because when you're younger you just

605
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,120
you just feel indestructible even though

606
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,600
Spirit made it clear to me I wasn't as

607
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,720
much as possible but the point is the

608
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,919
point is is when you're younger you you

609
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,279
think you got all the Time in the World

610
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,600
is what I'm trying to say to get this

611
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,559
information out I remember telling

612
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,080
spirit I remember saying yeah yeah yeah

613
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,720
there's plenty of time for that we'll

614
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,000
let the information out and spirit's

615
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,760
like no you you don't you don't get

616
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,600
it you got your life time to get it out

617
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,720
but it's it's there it's it's going

618
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,440
backwards out there you have to try you

619
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,200
can't just click on the

620
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,919
TV and sit inside your living room and

621
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,520
expect this information from me being

622
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,840
Spirit to get out there and change the

623
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,240
course change the course of time to

624
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,720
change the course of Health change the

625
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,799
course of what's going

626
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,120
on I'm like no there's no rush I'll just

627
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,600
watch this old episode of some sitcom

628
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:04,159
there's no rush you know being a kid but

629
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,360
there but but it matters it matters and

630
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm and I'm I'm I'm on the train of

631
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,640
rushing it so brain inflammation gut

632
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,320
inflammation gut small intestinal tract

633
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,880
inflammation you know like sibo for

634
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,679
instance trepac cacus we covered that in

635
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,960
the sibo show right colon information

636
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,320
such as like the shingles virus that's

637
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,799
causing

638
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,960
colitis or even a basic you know

639
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,799
irritable bow you know strep causing

640
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
irritable vow strep is a real big

641
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,840
irritable vow IBS

642
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,360
deal you know pathogens pathogens and if

643
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,200
you're a big parasite believer real big

644
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,559
parasite believer just know that these

645
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,760
are the the very things that show off

646
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,240
shell casings and show off um all the

647
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,159
different broken uh viral bodies and

648
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,120
showcasing that science doesn't have the

649
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,080
tag on so when it comes out to a stool

650
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,760
sample you're alternative practition say

651
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,559
you got parasites I don't care what name

652
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,399
you use you want to use parasites you

653
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,520
use the word parasites are there

654
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,760
parasites yes there's parasites but

655
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,720
parasites let's talk about parasites for

656
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,279
a second going to have to do a show on

657
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,279
actually you know what I'll do a whole

658
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,080
show on parasites because that because

659
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,279
it's going to get everybody angry

660
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,720
because the belief system around

661
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,840
parasites is so tightly woven right now

662
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,559
that I'm afraid to even touch it because

663
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,559
I'm just going to get just get people

664
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,760
are going to want to punch my lights out

665
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,200
so I have to make sure it's explained

666
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,600
with all the details from Spirit so it

667
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
can be easily

668
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,919
understood instead of just saying a one

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,159
blank statement you know don't get lost

670
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,679
in the parasitical thing because there's

671
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,760
a lot of problems going on with that

672
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,200
that I got to explained and then

673
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,120
somebody getting really mad so we're

674
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,640
going to do a whole show on that there

675
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,080
are parasites okay for anybody who's all

676
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,240
of a sudden starting to freak out right

677
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,080
now there are parasites okay so don't

678
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,320
don't don't worry okay I'm just going to

679
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,399
explain really what's happening and uh

680
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,559
hopefully by the end of that show you're

681
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,919
you're not angry as a Bee

682
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,679
um it's all about it's you know it's all

683
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,640
about you know you know getting the

684
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,200
information out and and trying to get it

685
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,080
out in a way that that obviously works

686
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,480
for all of us here's the deal here's the

687
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,480
deal um with with like the gut

688
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
inflammation we have all these different

689
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,919
pathogens that get inside the gut and

690
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,480
cause an inflammation in the gut I mean

691
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,840
you got se you got you got a whole bunch

692
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,559
of different bacteria bacteria is really

693
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,039
a leading thing that sits inside the

694
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,159
colon in the gut and everything and then

695
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,640
you got the viruses you know all

696
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,200
different kinds cytoma virus you got all

697
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
the different herpetic viruses you got

698
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,039
all the shingle viruses you got the

699
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
Epstein bar varieties you got all the

700
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,480
mutated hhv 6es and everything else you

701
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,559
got them all undiscovered hhv 10 11 12

702
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,360
the whole name it all Gets In The Cut

703
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,960
causes trouble so then when you eat some

704
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,039
wheat or you know whatever wheat gluten

705
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,559
and you eat it goes down the a pike and

706
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,760
it finally gets there there's a Feeding

707
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,679
Frenzy and now you're like oh my God I'm

708
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,399
constipated I'm feeling a belly ache I'm

709
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,360
feeling you know I'm wheat intolerant

710
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,279
I'm gluten intolerant um you know I got

711
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,519
Celiac the doctor says I have Celiac

712
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,559
Celiac is just an it's just it's not a

713
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,519
genetic not a genetic disease or illness

714
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,440
it's an

715
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,679
inflammatory illness it's an

716
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,720
inflammatory illness because pathogens

717
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,399
so um so so then next thing you know you

718
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,159
know Celiac you got that going on

719
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,399
and um and this is this is due to all

720
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,000
that kind kind of stuff in the gut organ

721
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:39,399
inflammation organ dense organs so forth

722
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,080
you know not just Hollow inflammation in

723
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,399
the organs any organ really liver can be

724
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,440
inflamed how does the liver get

725
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,399
inflamed how why would a liver get

726
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,760
inflamed every you know you wouldn't

727
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,039
believe how many livers are inflamed I

728
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,080
can't even I I hate going out I hate

729
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,600
going out I hate leaving the

go somewhere cuz I'm just going to be

734
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,559
read I'm just going to be reading liver

735
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,320
inflammation but what's under and what's

736
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,640
causing the liver inflammation I mean

737
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,159

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,200
literally at the stoplight that person's

749
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,480
got a liver problem that person's got

750
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,919
inflammation of the liver that person

751
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,360
has inflammation of the liver you know

752
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,480
you go into a restaurant I had to meet

753
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,159
somebody in a restaurant and I'm in a

754
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,039
restaurant and I'm like asking spirit is

755
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,880
there food poisoning on this is this was

756
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
there was was the chef playing around

757
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,519
with raw chicken and then and then put

758
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,399
my salad together I mean was you know or

759
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,799
put my dish together was the million

760
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,919
questions I have to ask Spirit while I'm

761
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:05,600
in a restaurant to make sure that I

762
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,000
don't get the worst food poisoning of a

763
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,159
lifetime end up in the in the ER and

764
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
intensive care seen people in intensive

765
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,480
care because of food poisoning it breaks

766
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,519
your heart over just stupid mistakes

767
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,120
done in the kitchen and restaurants so

768
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,200
you know it's all that but the liver I

769
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,480
see I see people the liver problems is

770
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,840
unbelievable

771
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:31,080
unbelievable and um so the bottom line

772
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,200
is what's inflaming the liver pathogens

773
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,000
pathogens whether it triggers off liver

774
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,039
en enzyme issues you know whatever Bly

775
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,880
Rin issues whatever it's triggering

776
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,399
off it you know whether the MRI and Cat

777
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,799
Scan starts seeing damage and then tell

778
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,440
somebody they have Hepatitis C by the

779
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,679
way that's Epstein bar long-term damage

780
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,960
in the liver causing hepatitis C ABD

781
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,880
ABCD is all

782
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,320
viral but but you might you might say

783
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,600
well ABD ABC d got to learn my alphabet

784
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,760
today you might say that that's you know

785
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,760
hepatitis A B C and

786
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,240
D tongue twister you might say that they

787
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,840
already know that that's viral they

788
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,519
don't know what virus it is did you know

789
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,120
that medical research and science

790
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,600
doesn't know what virus it is they just

791
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,240
go by inflammatory

792
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,240
markers they go by CAT scans MRIs and

793
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,519
inflammation they don't know what kind

794
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,559
of virus it

795
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,720
is Hepatitis B they don't know what kind

796
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,799
it's just a that's just a stage of

797
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,559
inflammation they don't know what kind

798
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,840
of bug it is I'm going to tell you right

799
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,279
now hepatitis C no one knows what kind

800
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,200
of bug that is hepatic liver inflamed

801
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,080
liver viral they find you know what's

802
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,559
amazing about research and science they

803
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,120
actually know this is amazing I find

804
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,760
this incredible they actually know you

805
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,320
know and I used I shouldn't have said

806
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,799
this years ago I think it was I think I

807
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,440
was being challenged by a couple of

808
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,799
doctor doctors they were really upset at

809
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,399
me they were upset because I was I was

810
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,639
you know had this information it was

811
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:08,679
like and they were like and this is in

812
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:10,600
the early days this is in the early days

813
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,880
this was like 15 years

814
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,840
ago and there's earlier days than that

815
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,399
but what what was happening 15 years ago

816
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,919
and a couple of doctors wanted to talk

817
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,919
to me because they wanted to know how I

818
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
figured out something and it was

819
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,039
accurate I told them how I figured it

820
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,720
out and how how it happened he said that

821
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,000
just doesn't make sense hear your voice

822
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,720
told you that this is what's going

823
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,880
on and I said yeah yeah yeah hear it

824
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,399
again here we go here we go here we go

825
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,000
again I was I know was like probably 17

826
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:44,000
or 18 years ago or

827
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,760
something and and you know and and and

828
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,919
they were like well no you couldn't have

829
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,440
heard a voice to know this you couldn't

830
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,919
have known that this liver was this bad

831
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,039
off and had the scar tissue it had in

832
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,279
the corner with a cyst in the corner ALS

833
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,760
scarred up and hepatitis C at the same

834
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:05,320
time there's no way you knew that

835
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,200
without some kind of documentation tests

836
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,280
and to confirm it some kind of blood

837
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,000
work where did you get this information

838
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,399
I said well I'm telling you where I got

839
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,480
it and you know and then and they said

840
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,240
and they said you know what I we were

841
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,879
going to we were going to we we wanted

842
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,359
to congratulate you on figuring this out

843
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,119
as a colleague but because you said you

844
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,119
heard it from The Source you heard it

845
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,280
from which is Spirit we're not going to

846
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,960
do that we're not going to we're not

847
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,000
going to give you any we're not going to

848
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,440
congratulate you I said you know what

849
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,560
you know what I was going to

850
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,720
congratulate you because what you stand

851
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,839
behind the research and science that's

852
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,599
given to you you actually know that

853
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,639
hepatitis C is a virus you know you

854
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,079
don't know what kind of virus it is but

855
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,919
you know it's a virus and I was going to

856
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,839
congratulate you guys for the fact that

857
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,119
you even know it's virus

858
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,359
but now I'm not even going to do that

859
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,079
I'm not going to congratulate you either

860
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,320
and they sat there they were baffled

861
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,400
because because yeah because they didn't

862
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,520
know what kind of virus it was but they

863
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,599
knew it was viral and they were like oh

864
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,320
yeah well okay and it's true because

865
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,400
it's hard for research and Science and

866
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,280
no and with the liver with hepatitis A B

867
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,440
and C and D it's a hepatic inflamed

868
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,040
liver they haven't singled out those

869
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,160
viruses they're not singled out I don't

870
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,720
care what anybody says because they have

871
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,079
not singled out those bugs at the blood

872
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,640
lab I'm telling you right now it's 17

873
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,920
years later still hav figured it out and

874
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,200
it's it's it's a herpetic

875
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,520
virus it gets in the liver and causes

876
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,440
different stages of what they deem

877
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,119
hepatitis different stages of

878
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,400
inflammation inflammation is not the

879
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,000
answer what's behind the inflammation is

880
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,280
the answer that's the great mistake

881
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,240
Ste do you guys still with me you still

882
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,000
with me skin inflammation you know we

883
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,480
also you know we see inflammation as the

884
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,040
body attacking itself that's a whole

885
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,680
another thing the body's attacking

886
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,880
itself you know autoimmune that's a

887
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,440
disaster disaster the body doesn't

888
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,480
attack itself I said it a million times

889
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,599
in these shows inflammation there's a

890
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,520
cause for inflammation and the cause

891
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,640
will never be the body attacking itself

892
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,119
and that's what happens with liver

893
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,119
problems too with mystery liver mystery

894
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,599
liver inflammation inflammation and be

895
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,760
like well it's autoimmune in liver it's

896
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,000
autoimmune hepatic problems it's

897
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,079
autoimmune uh um going on in the liver a

898
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,119
doctor will say profession will say

899
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,040
medical communities is say no there's a

900
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:49,319
cause so you

901
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,720
know here the bottom line is is that the

902
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,520
body doesn't attack itself we get

903
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,440
inflamed for those two reasons I told

904
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:00,760
you you can cut get a cut it's an injury

905
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,400
you can get dental work it's an

inflammation you can have eye

949
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,160
inflammation from anything any kind of

950
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,520
meaning any kind of bacteria gets in

951
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,240
there sty you're you know you touch a

952
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,359
door handle you're going into an office

953
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,800
building and 50 people grabbed that

954
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:56,359
handle and didn't wash their hands when

955
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,440
they went to bathroom that morning or

956
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:01,160
came came from the coffee shop and

957
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,800
touched every dirty handle and device

958
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,560
there is and didn't use a handy wipe and

959
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,359
they're all touching the door at the

960
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,119
office and you just go and grab that

961
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:12,160
door and open it up and you're running

962
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,800

run and and and give you like sneezing

969
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,160
and running because that's how you get

970
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,000
the inflammation in

971
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,440
there glaucoma glaucoma is a virus

972
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,960
that's actually one of the viruses from

973
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,119
the Epstein bar family one of the

974
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,960
mutated forms that goes after the eyes

975
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,520
causes eye problems like glaucoma it's a

976
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,720
whole different kind if you got Epstein

977
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,680
bar doesn't mean you have any of the

978
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,520
Epstein bar varieties that do any of

979
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,640
this there's a lot of different

980
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,960
varieties I could talk about the

981
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,319
different groups of medical meum book

982
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,480
one if you don't have medical medium

983
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,520
book one and you're listening to the

984
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,560
show I I'm sad I'm sad

985
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,480
I want you to get it because you need to

986
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,440
read

987
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,839
it and

988
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,839
um anyway so so that's giving you a kind

989
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,520
of the gist on this of how it works like

990
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,240
what's happening and giving information

991
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,040
around all these things neurological

992
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,720
inflammation nerve inflammation

993
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,440
fibromyalgia

994
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,599
fibromyalgia severe chronic fatigue

995
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,200
syndrome chronic fatigue syndrome is is

996
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,160
is uh brain inflammation it's

997
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
neurological fatigue very mild brain

998
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,319
inflammation somebody can't do anything

999
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,400
they can't even function their brain's

1000
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,640
inflamed

1001
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,640
and the uh the fibromyalgia but you know

1002
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,599
inflammation is not enough you go to the

1003
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,680
best specialist there is with

1004
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,960
CFS I mean all the different varieties

1005
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,839
of CFS they keep on renaming it all the

1006
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,760
different varieties of

1007
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,800
CFS you know you go to the best

1008
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
specialist they might you might get

1009
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,079
somebody to say you know I think you had

1010
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,400
brain inflammation

1011
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,359
but from

1012
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,400
what from what virus we're still so far

1013
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,960
off we're still so far off I mean I'm

1014
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,079
lucky I don't know about lucky but I

1015
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,319
could ask spirit and say well what wood

1016
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,119
virus is in this person's brain that's

1017
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:19,200
inflaming them so bad that they can't

1018
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,880
get out of bed at all and they can't

1019
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,720
even walk or talk what virus is it and

1020
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,680
spirit will tell me spirit will say well

1021
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,480
it's you know it's Epstein bar spirit

1022
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,200
will say it's Epstein bar and shingles

1023
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,400
it's both spirit will say it's Epstein

1024
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,400
bar shingles and

1025
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,119
hhv6 you know I'm lucky I can get that

1026
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,079
so I can get the information for people

1027
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,040
in the

1028
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,560
world but you need you go into you go

1029
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,400
into chronic illness world of today and

1030
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,280
you just can't get

1031
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,119
answers and and yeah sure I didn't

1032
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,800
realize that when I was when I was 10

1033
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,240
years old 11 years old Spirit kept on

1034
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,960
telling me and said you don't understand

1035
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,359
Anthony this has to get out there and

1036
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,560
you have to work harder on it and you

1037
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,200
have to care you also have to care and I

1038
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,440
do

1039
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,880
um you know this just kills me actually

1040
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,560
so what people go through

1041
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,520
so let's talk about some other things

1042
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,400
with this with all of this so we got the

1043
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,760
fibromyalgia I was mentioning we got the

1044
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,160
rheumatoid arthritis which is

1045
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,800
inflammation that's not the body

1046
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,839
attacking itself they're going to chalk

1047
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,359
up fibro eventually to being completely

1048
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,520
autoimmune which I think they already

1049
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,280
did I think they might have thrown that

1050
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,839
one in there by now where the body's you

1051
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,119
know body's destroying

1052
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,119
itself and the body's not destroying

1053
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,559
itself cu the body doesn't attack itself

1054
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,280
the body is there helping you protecting

1055
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:45,640
you and an Invader is causing the

1056
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,599
inflammation so you know here's here's

1057
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,359
the deal with inflammatory

1058
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,839
tests let's cover a couple of them all

1059
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:56,160
right you got the C reactive protein

1060
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:58,359
test which is worthless because it's

1061
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,000
it's just roundabout getting you know

1062
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:02,920
looking for inflammation in in different

1063
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,440
ways this is just just to let the doctor

1064
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,440
know there's

1065
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,480
inflammation and then you have the ESR

1066
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,680
Rosy sedimentation rate I don't know if

1067
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,599
you've ever had that one but that's

1068
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:20,000
another one the doctor can order at the

1069
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:23,680
lab and that one is just another type of

1070
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,720
inflammatory test to see if you got some

1071
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,240
some type of inflammation and maybe they

1072
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,160
can throw a bogus label like lupus on

1073
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,760
you because they don't even know what

1074
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,520
lupus is or how it works or anything I

1075
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,319
don't even the best guys don't even know

1076
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,599
yet and I wish they did I I say these

1077
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,880
things because I hope it's it it

1078
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,559
instigates someone to say okay I am

1079
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,720
going to go out and find those answers I

1080
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,960
am going to get funding without without

1081
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,839
the thumb scale being pushed by by you

1082
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,040
know by interest groups I am going to

1083
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,119
get clean funding I am going to get the

1084
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,400
answers for this so we can figure it out

1085
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,079
I'm I'm not going to just blame

1086
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,520
everything on genes anymore because

1087
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,559
that's where science wants to go because

1088
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,680
that's where the money's going and so it

1089
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,440
puts the blame on you I want to find the

1090
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,119
answers that's what I hope someday

1091
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,599
because I can't do this alone and you

1092
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,119
know I rely on you guys too you know

1093
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,960
getting the information out so there's

1094
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,720
another test called PV plasma viscosity

1095
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,160
it's another inflammatory

1096
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,400
test and but that's another one that

1097
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,040
that just looks for around about

1098
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,480
inflammation okay there's another test

1099
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,559
IG you you guys know the IgA

1100
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,559
test and what about the you know

1101
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:37,280
immunoglobulin G test which is

1102
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:40,440
IGG you know that one okay it's just an

1103
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,760
inflammatory test that's what that is in

1104
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,400
the end you still don't know what is

1105
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,040
causing the inflammation this is so

1106
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,480
important to know I hope I'm not boring

1107
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,200
you guys today I'm hoping I hope I'm not

1108
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:58,160
I hope I'm not um ana anti-nuclear

1109
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,119
antibod test and we also call it antibod

1110
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,760
antinuclear antigen test I've seen you

1111
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,960
know a lot of practitioners call it that

1112
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,599
I've called it

1113
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,599
that and that's one too round about

1114
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,079
inflammation liver

1115
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,359
enzyme blood work

1116
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,000
test that's another one that's another

1117
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,720
one and it's got a couple of cousins too

1118
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,559
there's a couple of cousins also that

1119
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,240
are being used meaning cousins not

1120
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,559
people but uh tests called cousins

1121
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,520
Sister Sister

1122
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,079
sister tests of some of these liver

1123
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,079
enzymes and other these tests that are

1124
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,160
being developed but they're just for

1125
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,520
inflammation they don't discover what's

1126
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,000
wrong and the cause of your inflammation

1127
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,319
and that's where it hurts man that's

1128
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,920
where it hurts I call these guest tests

1129
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,240
these are called guest tests that's what

1130
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,480
they are and here's the problem here's

1131
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,520
the scary part here's the problem that

1132
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,400
really Spooks me if there's something

1133
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,319
that wakes me up at night I'm going to

1134
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,720
tell you what it it is and if this gets

1135
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:02,880
you angry if this gets you angry just

1136
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,520
you know don't don't quit listening to

1137
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,400
the shows because I need your help I

1138
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,319
need you learning this information don't

1139
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,640
quit listening to the shows don't stop

1140
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:18,880
you know don't get

1141
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:21,200
mad but here's the problem all those um

1142
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,040
inflammatory guest tests are being used

1143
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,520
against us with Lyme disease because

1144
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,520
what they're doing is they're filling in

1145
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,400
the blank they're putting in their own

1146
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,920
names of bacteria next to those

1147
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,520
inflammatory markers but yet not finding

1148
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,720
the bacteria itself and that's what

1149
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,839
they're doing all at the new

1150
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,359
labs and it's painstaking and

1151
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,000
painful and so then you know you get a

1152
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,400
lime D so all you need is a little bit

1153
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,480
of inflammation and you got a lime

1154
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,920
diagnosis now like honestly everything's

1155
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,559
getting funnel to Lime before you

1156
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,920
explode or get mad listen to my lime

1157
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,520
show or I'm going to do an update at

1158
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,400
lime show or or go to the lime chapter

1159
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,240
and medical meeting book one if you if

1160
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,599
you haven't gotten that you have to get

1161
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,920
that you can't just get mad at me for

1162
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,680
talking about Lyme disease because of a

1163
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,880
ingrained belief system you might have

1164
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,200
and not get that chapter out of medical

1165
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,839
medium book one and read it it's unfair

1166
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,599
you got to you got to get it and read

1167
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,319
it

1168
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,960
and even I mean really cuz I want to

1169
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,359
help it's about helping and if you're

1170
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,920
suffering even more so

1171
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,800
reason even more so

1172
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,200
reason so what happens is the all the

1173
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,760
anti-inflammatory tests are being used

1174
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,119
in the labs and it's a disconnect from

1175
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,800
the doctor the doctor who orders the

1176
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,119
Lyme disease test has no clue that the

1177
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,440
labs are actually taking all those

1178
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,800
inflammatory tests and then they're

1179
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,000
filling in the blank with the

1180
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,960
bacteria if that wasn't the case there

1181
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,160
would never be a borderline you either

1182
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,559
have it or you don't you either have the

1183
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,599
bacteria whether it's Boreal b bellia or

1184
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,040
some other bacteria or babesia whatever

1185
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,880
it is a parasite whatever it is you

1186
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,440
think you have it's either you have it

1187
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,040
or you don't

1188
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,720
not borderline so when the labs do the

1189
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,559
inflammatory tests and they put the name

1190
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,200
bellia next to a little bit of

1191
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,200
inflammation on the score sheet ship it

1192
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,000
to the doctor and the doctor has no idea

1193
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,760
that they didn't identify the bug why do

1194
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,359
you think so many people come back

1195
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,880
borderline you either have the bug or

1196
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:20,119
you don't it's one of the mistakes that

1197
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,400
they're probably going to fix it the

1198
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:23,119
labs because they know someone's

1199
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,000
catching

1200
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:30,280
on just telling you

1201
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,599
so here's the deal here's the deal

1202
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,280
everything's getting funneled into

1203
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,720
inflammation but with no

1204
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:40,720
answers the only thing I like about the

1205
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,920
lime disease trap the lime trap which is

1206
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,319
very little the only thing I like is

1207
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,400
that they're actually equating

1208
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,720
inflammation to a pathogen even if they

1209
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,200
have the wrong

1210
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,400
pathogens even if they have the wrong

1211
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,880
pathogens even if they're picking on

1212
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,599
bacteria that isn't what's behind

1213
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,520
people's lme suffering and there's

1214
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,839
another pathogen behind people's Lyme

1215
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,960
suff suffering why do you think every 10

1216
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,760
years they're going to come up with a

1217
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,599
new

1218
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
bacteria and say then and then basically

1219
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,480
Outcast the old

1220
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,839
ones why do you think when Lyme disease

1221
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,280
was first discovered in 1973 when it was

1222
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,960
first discovered right around on that

1223
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,880
time the every doctor every doctor on

1224
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,960
every board knew it was viral and they

1225
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,359
all agreed it was viral but there was no

1226
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,119
treatment so they had to go to

1227
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,520
antibiotics and then demon bacteria

1228
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:28,760
later in 1981 the point

1229
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,640
is and if you're getting upset about

1230
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,160
this listen uh it's all good call listen

1231
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,720
it's all good let's you know we're going

1232
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,160
to do a new show on that we have to it's

1233
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,680
about time the bottom line

1234
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,520
is I'm just glad in the lime world

1235
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,040
they're equating inflammation to a

1236
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,880
pathogen thank God thank God I'm so

1237
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,400
happy for that so if you want if you

1238
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,640
want to know the truth I'm happy about

1239
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,440
something because that's the whole point

1240
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,160
like I said back to square one there's

1241
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,160
two things for inflammation there's

1242
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,119
injury and there's pathogen even if you

1243
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,599
got the wrong pathogen even if the

1244
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,000
doctors got the wrong pathogen they

1245
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,559
think it's a bacteria they don't think

1246
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,839
this even if the doctors don't know

1247
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,440
hepatitis C is Epstein bar even if the

1248
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,760
doctors don't know that this is you know

1249
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,400
this is this this inflammation from this

1250
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,040
is this kind of pathogen if they think

1251
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,079
pathogens related we've already moved

1252
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,160
forward thank God and that's the whole

1253
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:22,599
point and I love that part about it so

1254
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,520
don't get mad if you hear me talking

1255
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,880
about lime if you're a big lime fan just

1256
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,640
you know just look into what I've

1257
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,280
already talked about before and it'll

1258
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,920
make more sense because I can't do it

1259
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,559
justice in four minutes let's talk about

1260
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,640
Foods anti-inflamatory Foods I pulled

1261
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:40,040
these right out of the life-changing

1262
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,040
Foods book pull them right out of the
