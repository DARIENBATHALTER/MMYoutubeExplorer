[0.03 - 5.04] and this is in a nutshell to make it as
[1.92 - 7.14] easy as possible you need two things to
[5.04 - 9.27] be chronically ill two things to have a
[7.14 - 11.61] symptom that won't go away two things
[9.27 - 14.04] that makes your life say let you know
[11.61 - 18.06] the less quality of life two things have
[14.04 - 19.86] to be there toxins and pathogens you
[18.06 - 22.11] need two things there that's what you
[19.86 - 24.54] need and that's what's happening
[22.11 - 28.38] everyone's building a lot of toxins up
[24.54 - 31.83] and they're catching a lot of pathogens
[28.38 - 34.47] that's what's happening and bottom line
[31.83 - 38.01] all these illnesses everything behind
[34.47 - 41.67] autoimmune is a virus or even bacteria
[38.01 - 43.23] involved or both and some poisons for it
[41.67 - 45.72] to feed on so to make it really simple
[43.23 - 47.43] really simple you have certain toxins in
[45.72 - 50.88] your body and they become food for
[47.43 - 53.97] certain bugs pathogens pathogens eat the
[50.88 - 57.68] toxins they release a poison and we all
[53.97 - 57.68] get sick and sicker and sicker
