[79.28 - 85.84] is a way to get leafy greens in you
[82.64 - 88.32] healthy nutritious life
[85.84 - 90.00] saving leafy greens because leafy greens
[88.32 - 92.40] are antiviral
[90.00 - 93.04] antibacterial foods they have properties
[92.40 - 96.32] in them that
[93.04 - 100.00] actually inhibit viruses
[96.32 - 101.28] inhibit bacteria and banana does too
[100.00 - 102.88] so when you think about it you got
[101.28 - 104.48] banana and you got a salad and you got
[102.88 - 105.12] your banana salad what you're doing for
[104.48 - 107.12] yourself
[105.12 - 108.40] is really important and there's no fats
[107.12 - 110.56] in this recipe because i know
[108.40 - 112.56] most everybody they're inundated with
[110.56 - 114.88] fats in their diet so i'd like to get a
[112.56 - 115.44] recipe in your diet once in a while that
[114.88 - 117.36] doesn't
[115.44 - 118.64] have all the fats and isn't packed with
[117.36 - 120.64] all the fats
[118.64 - 122.16] and talk about why that's not good
[120.64 - 125.20] either to have all the fats
[122.16 - 126.88] so um talk about the banana salad start
[125.20 - 129.04] making it
[126.88 - 130.80] let's see i got some teas here i'm going
[129.04 - 133.52] to talk about a little bit too
[130.80 - 136.32] josh is it okay to put a clean protein
[133.52 - 138.00] powder in the detox smoothie
[136.32 - 140.84] would alter the effectiveness of the
[138.00 - 143.84] smoothie josh
[140.84 - 143.84] 99.99
[144.08 - 148.16] of protein powders have natural
[145.92 - 150.64] flavoring in it if you see
[148.16 - 151.68] berry flavor that's a natural flavor and
[150.64 - 153.28] i'm going to talk about what natural
[151.68 - 156.80] flavoring really is
[153.28 - 157.76] if you see natural flavoring natural
[156.80 - 161.20] flavor
[157.76 - 163.68] organic flavor flavoring on its own
[161.20 - 164.96] whatever the term if you see the word
[163.68 - 167.12] flavor
[164.96 - 168.00] flavor you're in trouble so i'm just
[167.12 - 170.48] letting you know if that's in the
[168.00 - 171.68] ingredient list and so you be careful
[170.48 - 173.28] because you can be dumping a protein
[171.68 - 173.84] powder that's got natural flavorings in
[173.28 - 177.20] it
[173.84 - 179.92] and what does that have msg
[177.20 - 182.32] is msg bad dangerous we're going to talk
[179.92 - 183.68] about what it does to the brain what msg
[182.32 - 186.32] does to the mind
[183.68 - 187.36] why natural flavoring should not be in
[186.32 - 189.84] supplements
[187.36 - 190.56] you know for example the vimergy
[189.84 - 192.64] supplements
[190.56 - 194.48] never had and never will have natural
[192.64 - 196.88] flavoring
[194.48 - 198.56] i noticed that traditional medicinal
[196.88 - 200.00] teas that's a tea i drink and not
[198.56 - 201.84] sponsored by these guys
[200.00 - 203.52] doesn't have natural flavoring in it but
[201.84 - 204.96] most teas do now
[203.52 - 206.88] natural flavors of all different kinds
[204.96 - 210.32] whether it's raspberry flavor
[206.88 - 213.60] some other kind of flavor dr fans on md
[210.32 - 216.64] great doctor glad you're here um
[213.60 - 217.28] so giselle says what if you can't eat
[216.64 - 220.56] carbs
[217.28 - 222.80] well you're getting sugar somewhere so
[220.56 - 224.56] if you give you you you must be getting
[222.80 - 227.20] sugar somewhere so
[224.56 - 228.96] certainly you're not carb free because
[227.20 - 231.84] say you're on a carnivore diet
[228.96 - 232.40] and you're doing all meat the meat has
[231.84 - 234.72] sugar
[232.40 - 235.44] in the blood and packed with sugar
[234.72 - 238.80] because
[235.44 - 241.20] the cow's blood sugar is really high
[238.80 - 242.88] so all that blood sugar is in all that
[241.20 - 244.64] blood is in the meat so that when you're
[242.88 - 246.88] broiling the meat
[244.64 - 249.12] you know cooking baking frying whatever
[246.88 - 251.52] it is you do with meat
[249.12 - 252.24] you're actually caramelizing the blood
[251.52 - 255.20] sugar
[252.24 - 256.88] is what's going on and that's why people
[255.20 - 258.64] can survive on eating meat
[256.88 - 260.80] because there's so much sugar in it and
[258.64 - 262.40] that's why it's almost sweet i've hear
[260.80 - 264.08] heard that over and over again i like a
[262.40 - 266.96] good steak people say
[264.08 - 268.00] it's just it's just it's sweet and zesty
[266.96 - 270.40] it's just got some kind
[268.00 - 271.84] of meaty sweet flavor yeah it doesn't
[270.40 - 273.68] taste like apple pie
[271.84 - 275.28] but they don't measure the blood sugar
[273.68 - 276.72] and meat they keep that part out
[275.28 - 278.48] so they'll tell you there's no carbs in
[276.72 - 280.08] your meat so you're getting carbs so
[278.48 - 283.52] you're actually doing carbs
[280.08 - 284.96] so so it's like you just is it you don't
[283.52 - 285.60] want to do a different carb you don't
[284.96 - 287.44] want to do an
[285.60 - 289.28] uh another carb or a healthier carb
[287.44 - 291.68] that's all that is
[289.28 - 292.32] but if you don't want to do the banana
[291.68 - 293.84] and
[292.32 - 295.12] you don't want to do anything like that
[293.84 - 295.68] we can figure something out and have a
[295.12 - 298.72] salad
[295.68 - 301.36] maybe tomatoes lunell said i had a b12
[298.72 - 303.20] supplement with natural flavorings
[301.36 - 305.52] before getting the vimergy one
[303.20 - 307.76] loon thanks for reminding me because
[305.52 - 310.64] that's exactly it the vimergy
[307.76 - 311.76] b12 doesn't have natural flavoring but
[310.64 - 313.84] there's a
[311.76 - 315.44] 20 other reasons why the b12 for vimergy
[313.84 - 317.04] is better than anybody out there but
[315.44 - 319.76] there yeah there's no natural flavoring
[317.04 - 321.36] and everybody had natural flavorings in
[319.76 - 324.00] their b12s
[321.36 - 325.44] and the couple of companies that might
[324.00 - 326.24] be out there without natural flavorings
[325.44 - 328.16] in their b12
[326.24 - 330.00] their copycats off vimergy because
[328.16 - 331.44] everybody had natural flavorings they
[330.00 - 333.36] had msg in their b12
[331.44 - 335.92] so that's what's happening so hey let me
[333.36 - 337.52] go take my b12 and get poisoned by msg
[335.92 - 339.36] that's what it is oh i got a migraine
[337.52 - 340.32] now i feel sick oh my god i just got a
[339.36 - 342.16] dizzy spell
[340.32 - 344.80] because of that msg those natural
[342.16 - 346.88] flavors that are in everybody else's b12
[344.80 - 348.64] and that's why it was critical that you
[346.88 - 350.16] you shouldn't have that in a supplement
[348.64 - 353.84] that's why i trust the vimergy
[350.16 - 357.52] but i got to go into what msg does
[353.84 - 359.60] how it works and when what they say
[357.52 - 360.00] about natural flavors out there to trick
[359.60 - 361.36] you
[360.00 - 363.84] you guys just got on here making a
[361.36 - 365.04] banana salad and just show you real
[363.84 - 366.32] quick because i see a bunch of people
[365.04 - 369.20] coming on it's gonna
[366.32 - 370.24] be like that after i'm done with it and
[369.20 - 373.28] it's a great recipe
[370.24 - 376.80] it's in medical medium new edition
[373.28 - 379.92] yeah loon it's crazy right totally
[376.80 - 381.92] you had your i see uh sonya said i had
[379.92 - 383.84] my vemma gb12 today incredible
[381.92 - 385.92] that's one i can trust and um the
[383.84 - 389.12] dinosaur kovaleman methylcobalamin
[385.92 - 392.84] so let's talk about it if there is
[389.12 - 395.12] natural flavoring in a supplement out
[392.84 - 399.04] there and the supplement
[395.12 - 401.12] company is trying to defend it
[399.04 - 402.32] you got a major problem you got a
[401.12 - 404.88] supplement company
[402.32 - 406.00] you can't trust because that supplement
[404.88 - 408.96] company
[406.00 - 409.92] doesn't even know or they do know and
[408.96 - 412.48] they're not going to say it
[409.92 - 413.76] or they don't know that there's msg in
[412.48 - 416.40] that natural flavoring
[413.76 - 418.48] now a company will say this there's no
[416.40 - 420.84] natural there's no msg in our natural
[418.48 - 423.92] flavors we talked to the manufacturing
[420.84 - 426.88] plant of those natural flavors
[423.92 - 428.72] you know we talked to the manufacturer
[426.88 - 431.04] of natural flavors and they said there's
[428.72 - 432.64] no msg in there so the msg is all
[431.04 - 433.92] organic and pure and it goes in our
[432.64 - 436.32] supplement
[433.92 - 437.12] but that's not the truth not the truth
[436.32 - 440.48] at all
[437.12 - 443.60] see years ago before natural flavoring
[440.48 - 444.96] was developed there were artificial
[443.60 - 447.76] flavoring
[444.96 - 449.52] artificial flavoring but when artificial
[447.76 - 452.96] flavoring was out there
[449.52 - 456.64] artificial flavoring didn't have msg
[452.96 - 458.64] in it okay so it had chemicals
[456.64 - 460.48] like different kinds of chemicals in it
[458.64 - 462.48] that's what artificial flavoring had
[460.48 - 464.48] right and sometimes now artificial
[462.48 - 467.04] flavoring will have msg
[464.48 - 468.08] but in the past years ago it didn't
[467.04 - 470.08] here's what happened
[468.08 - 472.00] get ready here's where you guys all been
[470.08 - 474.24] suckered all been tricked
[472.00 - 475.04] all been duped the wolves been pulled
[474.24 - 477.44] over your eyes
[475.04 - 479.44] right here i'm gonna drop it on you okay
[477.44 - 484.24] a deal was made
[479.44 - 488.40] okay that msg can hide now
[484.24 - 489.44] behind a veil the veil was natural
[488.40 - 491.76] flavoring
[489.44 - 493.76] that was a deal that was made in the
[491.76 - 496.32] food and drug world
[493.76 - 498.24] so here's how it goes everybody was
[496.32 - 500.24] figuring out msg was toxic
[498.24 - 501.52] everybody was figuring out msg was
[500.24 - 505.20] dangerous
[501.52 - 509.04] too many people got sick disturbed
[505.20 - 511.68] hurt by it okay and so msg
[509.04 - 513.44] would have to be labeled in the past so
[511.68 - 514.08] everybody's products on the store
[513.44 - 517.68] shelves
[514.08 - 520.24] all said msg in the ingredient list m s
[517.68 - 521.20] g in the ingredient list on all the
[520.24 - 524.08] shelves
[521.20 - 525.28] and then all of a sudden it disappeared
[524.08 - 528.48] gone
[525.28 - 531.04] right when natural flavors was birthed
[528.48 - 532.16] all of a sudden msg's not on any
[531.04 - 534.64] products anymore
[532.16 - 535.92] every single product in the condiment
[534.64 - 538.56] aisle and anywhere else
[535.92 - 540.56] in the store cans condiments you name it
[538.56 - 541.20] had msg in the ingredient list years and
[540.56 - 543.04] years ago
[541.20 - 544.56] you walk down the grocery store and you
[543.04 - 546.32] just grab something you read what it is
[544.56 - 548.88] it's a can of whatever beans
[546.32 - 550.16] msg oh here's a can of hot sauce a
[548.88 - 552.96] bottle of hot source
[550.16 - 554.16] msg you see msg and right when natural
[552.96 - 557.76] flavors was born
[554.16 - 560.80] msg disappeared off of everybody's label
[557.76 - 561.36] every single food product food company
[560.80 - 565.28] out there
[561.36 - 568.64] the word the letters msg
[565.28 - 572.96] gone disappeared overnight
[568.64 - 574.40] overnight so um has he ever said not
[572.96 - 577.28] sponsored by vimergy
[574.40 - 578.96] he is not answering me i am cat i am i'm
[577.28 - 580.56] not sponsored by vimergy
[578.96 - 582.00] okay so letting you know i'm not
[580.56 - 584.64] sponsored by
[582.00 - 585.20] traditional medicinals i'm not sponsored
[584.64 - 586.96] by
[585.20 - 588.32] dozens of other companies that you see
[586.96 - 589.92] on my directory
[588.32 - 591.52] i'm not sponsored not sponsored not
[589.92 - 593.68] sponsored okay
[591.52 - 595.12] the omega juicer though uh i am
[593.68 - 596.80] connected to mega juicer
[595.12 - 597.92] i licensed my name to them i tell you
[596.80 - 600.16] guys all the time they have the best
[597.92 - 602.32] juicer i've ever seen ever made
[600.16 - 603.68] and i just said you know what if if
[602.32 - 604.08] that's gonna save people thousands of
[603.68 - 607.20] dollars
[604.08 - 609.04] then then i'm in as far as i license my
[607.20 - 611.44] name i said you guys could use my name
[609.04 - 612.32] but as far as sponsored by vimergy no
[611.44 - 615.04] sponsored by
[612.32 - 616.80] traditional medicinals no so anyway the
[615.04 - 619.44] bottom line is
[616.80 - 621.68] when they did that switch over all these
[619.44 - 624.72] other products msg disappeared
[621.68 - 625.92] but it showed up as natural flavoring
[624.72 - 628.48] without the word
[625.92 - 629.28] so what they did was natural flavors
[628.48 - 631.60] flavoring
[629.28 - 632.96] raspberry flavor strawberry flavor any
[631.60 - 635.28] kind of flavor
[632.96 - 636.48] not vanilla extract don't get that
[635.28 - 639.68] confused
[636.48 - 643.20] extract is different than flavors
[639.68 - 644.56] flavorings or flavor so our flavors
[643.20 - 647.76] flavoring flavor okay
[644.56 - 650.80] so natural so extract
[647.76 - 654.24] is different so vanilla extract
[650.80 - 657.28] is different than vanilla flavoring
[654.24 - 658.40] really important to know all right so
[657.28 - 659.68] so when you're going through all your
[658.40 - 661.60] products you'll see natural flavors
[659.68 - 664.16] everywhere you go go in yourselves
[661.60 - 664.72] go through all your shelves check them
[664.16 - 666.96] out
[664.72 - 668.48] go through every single product on your
[666.96 - 670.48] shelves tonight
[668.48 - 671.52] go through all the food stuff in your
[670.48 - 673.68] pantries
[671.52 - 675.20] go into your fridge check out all the
[673.68 - 678.48] food stuff in your fridge
[675.20 - 679.68] and read every single label and you're
[678.48 - 681.60] going to be

[681.60 - 683.92] natural flavor somewhere natural
[683.20 - 686.32] flavoring
[683.92 - 687.04] and any product company that defends
[686.32 - 689.12] themselves
[687.04 - 690.40] a supplement company says no our stuff
[689.12 - 692.88] is pure
[690.40 - 694.72] um we talk to the manufacturing of that
[692.88 - 697.08] natural flavor and it is fine
[694.72 - 698.40] they don't have to disclose it the
[697.08 - 701.76] manufacturers
[698.40 - 702.32] of natural flavorings are not there they
[701.76 - 705.28] don't
[702.32 - 706.48] have to disclose the msg anymore it they
[705.28 - 708.96] got a free ride
[706.48 - 709.52] when the deal was made to hide msg
[708.96 - 712.64] because
[709.52 - 713.52] think about it thousands and thousands
[712.64 - 714.80] and thousands
[713.52 - 717.84] hundreds of thousands millions of
[714.80 - 719.44] products years ago all had to put msg on
[717.84 - 721.36] the bottle okay
[719.44 - 723.20] and then it disappeared so you're
[721.36 - 727.04] telling me the msg
[723.20 - 730.08] plant factories manufacturing facilities
[727.04 - 731.76] all stopped when they didn't have to
[730.08 - 733.28] you mean to tell me they just dropped
[731.76 - 734.96] hundreds of millions of dollars
[733.28 - 736.40] and just got rid of it and closed all
[734.96 - 739.52] their factories down
[736.40 - 740.96] for no reason no they kept it running
[739.52 - 743.36] but they were allowed to get the free
[740.96 - 746.96] ride and not have msg on the label
[743.36 - 748.64] see how it works but it was switched
[746.96 - 751.44] into natural flavoring
[748.64 - 752.16] and it's in every food almost every
[751.44 - 754.96] single
[752.16 - 756.64] bottle can different foods all the
[754.96 - 758.24] different packaged foods
[756.64 - 760.64] go through all your stuff go through
[758.24 - 763.68] anything you eat you're gonna find it
[760.64 - 767.12] and that right there is a way to get msg
[763.68 - 768.08] in your brain and that's when you become
[767.12 - 770.32] brain damaged
[768.08 - 772.72] in a different way msg builds up in
[770.32 - 774.40] pockets inside the brain causes damage
[772.72 - 776.32] to the neurotransmitters electrical
[774.40 - 779.60] impulses to the neurons
[776.32 - 782.72] msg is a neuroantagonist
[779.60 - 786.16] it does damage to brain tissue
[782.72 - 788.32] and you guys all become suckered into it
[786.16 - 790.96] not your fault at all on any level but
[788.32 - 791.44] when what really really gets my goat
[790.96 - 793.60] right
[791.44 - 795.04] because i'm about protecting you guys
[793.60 - 796.48] i'm about looking out for you guys what
[795.04 - 799.28] really gets me
[796.48 - 801.20] is supplement companies that get
[799.28 - 802.88] question on the msg on the natural
[801.20 - 804.56] flavors they get questioned by people
[802.88 - 807.68] like you guys who have learned because
[804.56 - 809.44] when medical medium
[807.68 - 812.08] the first edition of this book came out
[809.44 - 813.76] right i talked about natural flavoring
[812.08 - 816.08] in here and it being msg
[813.76 - 817.20] and so that started a movement so people
[816.08 - 820.08] can look out
[817.20 - 821.04] but for supplement companies that have
[820.08 - 823.60] followed
[821.04 - 824.72] medical medium or i've spoken to over
[823.60 - 827.68] the years
[824.72 - 828.88] ignore the warning that natural flavors
[827.68 - 830.96] is msg
[828.88 - 832.16] and they purposely put it in all their
[830.96 - 835.92] products and then
[832.16 - 839.04] tell all their mm fans followers
[835.92 - 841.36] users they tell them their natural
[839.04 - 843.28] flavors comes from a company that isn't
[841.36 - 846.80] msg which is not possible
[843.28 - 850.00] they're all msg and then tells them that
[846.80 - 850.56] is negligence and i know i see it all
[850.00 - 853.36] out there
[850.56 - 854.80] all over the place and it's like you
[853.36 - 857.04] know what
[854.80 - 858.80] you knew about it in here all the
[857.04 - 860.16] companies knew about it in here all the
[858.80 - 862.64] supplement companies all read the
[860.16 - 864.48] medical medium books especially this one
[862.64 - 865.76] and i've talked to all the supplement
[864.48 - 867.68] companies out there
[865.76 - 869.76] and they knew about the natural flavors
[867.68 - 870.08] so to still have them in their products
[869.76 - 873.20] is
[870.08 - 874.88] just it's just disgusting really so
[873.20 - 875.84] back to protecting you guys because
[874.88 - 877.36] that's what it's about let's start
[875.84 - 880.24] making a banana salad i'll talk a little
[877.36 - 882.88] bit more about this
[880.24 - 885.12] i got some romaine here i don't know if
[882.88 - 888.88] you guys are doing romaine at all
[885.12 - 892.40] hello from romania cool romaine lettuce
[888.88 - 892.40] so i got it i'm going to chop it up
[892.64 - 898.08] msg cedaria says msg was created for
[895.52 - 900.72] pharmaceutical companies
[898.08 - 903.60] very interesting very interesting the
[900.72 - 905.20] msg factories
[903.60 - 907.20] didn't just throw their hands in the air
[905.20 - 908.64] and give up so i'm chopping up this
[907.20 - 910.56] romaine it's going to go
[908.64 - 912.64] i'm not going to leave it in really big
[910.56 - 913.76] pieces i'm chopping the salad a little
[912.64 - 917.04] bit
[913.76 - 918.00] okay guys the msg companies didn't just
[917.04 - 920.16] give up
[918.00 - 921.52] and they were done the day natural
[920.16 - 924.32] flavors arrived
[921.52 - 926.16] and every single bottle stopped saying
[924.32 - 928.40] msg on it
[926.16 - 929.20] they actually morphed it into natural
[928.40 - 932.80] flavors
[929.20 - 937.28] organic flavors yep
[932.80 - 940.40] organic flavoring look
[937.28 - 942.16] why should i care why should i care why
[940.40 - 945.20] should i like
[942.16 - 946.96] work this hard to like let you guys know
[945.20 - 948.48] because i'm thinking about that baby
[946.96 - 950.32] somewhere
[948.48 - 952.64] and i'm thinking about that two-year-old
[950.32 - 954.88] somewhere that doesn't need natural
[952.64 - 957.28] flavoring msg
[954.88 - 958.80] and the little two-year-old's brain
[957.28 - 961.76] which is going to then support
[958.80 - 963.68] adhd support problems with toxic heavy
[961.76 - 965.76] metals make problems with toxic heavy
[963.68 - 967.44] metals worse
[965.76 - 969.20] i'm thinking about that child that's
[967.44 - 971.20] five year old five years old
[969.20 - 973.44] and the mom thinks that that organic
[971.20 - 976.48] natural flavoring is perfectly healthy
[973.44 - 978.64] and doesn't know i'm thinking about that
[976.48 - 980.08] little one that's taking supplements
[978.64 - 981.12] because mom wants a little one to take
[980.08 - 982.72] supplements
[981.12 - 985.12] and it's a crappy supplement because
[982.72 - 988.24] it's got msg in it
[985.12 - 988.56] and no one's telling that mom like you
[988.24 - 991.84] know
[988.56 - 991.84] what do i do stay quiet
[992.16 - 997.12] and i get crap for all this stuff but
[995.60 - 998.72] i mean i don't get it am i supposed to
[997.12 - 999.04] just kick back and be like you know what
[998.72 - 1001.84] let
[999.04 - 1002.48] everybody just do their thing everybody
[1001.84 - 1004.08] just
[1002.48 - 1005.68] you know let them do their thing that's
[1004.08 - 1008.00] their business well is it
[1005.68 - 1009.52] or is it the business of a two-year-old
[1008.00 - 1010.88] a five-year-old a mommy
[1009.52 - 1012.80] you know and the whole bit so that's
[1010.88 - 1015.60] important to know you guys
[1012.80 - 1017.76] i just put some romaine in here so i got
[1015.60 - 1021.36] that it's really beautiful that
[1017.76 - 1024.32] romaine lettuce is a leafy green but
[1021.36 - 1025.04] it's not as powerful it's powerful in a
[1024.32 - 1027.36] different way
[1025.04 - 1028.72] lettuces got their own source of
[1027.36 - 1030.56] nutrient power okay
[1028.72 - 1032.24] photochemical compounds and alkaloids
[1030.56 - 1034.48] and stuff but
[1032.24 - 1036.16] um but you know i love other leafy
[1034.48 - 1038.24] greens so like using herbs as leafy
[1036.16 - 1040.16] greens like cilantro it's medical medium
[1038.24 - 1041.44] information no one's used cilantro like
[1040.16 - 1043.20] leafy green
[1041.44 - 1044.88] and i say this because i've taught so
[1043.20 - 1046.96] many people now to use it as a leafy
[1044.88 - 1048.40] green where you got all this cilantro so
[1046.96 - 1050.24] i tell people the same thing you do
[1048.40 - 1052.80] romaine lettuce do a
[1050.24 - 1053.84] cilantro salad with that much let's try
[1052.80 - 1057.44] that one day
[1053.84 - 1059.52] bananas on that kimberly miller says
[1057.44 - 1061.60] your info healed my alcoholism
[1059.52 - 1064.96] incredible it really is
[1061.60 - 1066.00] um and i'm really proud of you seriously
[1064.96 - 1068.32] that is not easy
[1066.00 - 1070.24] that is not easy to break i'm really
[1068.32 - 1073.52] proud of you on that one
[1070.24 - 1074.56] i'm gonna chop up some cucumber some
[1073.52 - 1076.72] slices
[1074.56 - 1077.76] okay i'm gonna peel back the cucumber a
[1076.72 - 1082.64] little bit you guys
[1077.76 - 1086.48] it's cutting off the ends right here so
[1082.64 - 1088.24] look i don't want companies out there
[1086.48 - 1090.56] having problems i want them to live
[1088.24 - 1093.68] their life and sell their stuff
[1090.56 - 1094.56] but i want them to fix what they know is
[1093.68 - 1097.60] wrong
[1094.56 - 1099.84] or if they don't know what's wrong i
[1097.60 - 1103.28] want them to fix it anyway
[1099.84 - 1104.72] right because in the end it's just going
[1103.28 - 1107.52] to hurt everybody
[1104.72 - 1109.36] it's people that get all kinds of
[1107.52 - 1112.64] neurological symptoms
[1109.36 - 1115.44] from msg because msg
[1112.64 - 1116.88] um really kind of makes things worse if
[1115.44 - 1118.80] you're viral if you've got low grade
[1116.88 - 1120.32] viral infections like ebv
[1118.80 - 1122.24] if you got toxic heavy metals and you're
[1120.32 - 1125.44] dealing with anxiety and depression
[1122.24 - 1127.52] natural flavoring can really add into
[1125.44 - 1131.20] that depression that anxiety
[1127.52 - 1133.84] it's kind of like another cut
[1131.20 - 1135.52] death by a thousand cuts all these
[1133.84 - 1137.20] different cuts
[1135.52 - 1138.64] can you eat the skin on all cucumbers
[1137.20 - 1141.68] yes you can i
[1138.64 - 1144.24] conventional cucumbers um i would
[1141.68 - 1146.16] probably peel them back a little bit
[1144.24 - 1148.24] but all cucumbers in general organic
[1146.16 - 1149.20] ones you can i would still wash the
[1148.24 - 1152.32] cucumber
[1149.20 - 1153.20] like i washed this is what i did i leave
[1152.32 - 1155.84] the skin on
[1153.20 - 1156.96] most dishes i kind of do this because it
[1155.84 - 1159.52] gives it a look
[1156.96 - 1160.32] too there's a look i was going for by
[1159.52 - 1161.76] having like
[1160.32 - 1165.84] taking the skin back a little bit you
[1161.76 - 1168.16] see i was going for this kind of look um
[1165.84 - 1169.68] but yeah you can keep the skin on them
[1168.16 - 1170.48] just that if they're conventional i
[1169.68 - 1172.88] wouldn't
[1170.48 - 1175.12] on cucumbers i'd probably peel them back
[1172.88 - 1176.84] at least a little bit
[1175.12 - 1179.60] so i'm going to peel this one back now
[1176.84 - 1182.64] too
[1179.60 - 1182.96] that's what i'm doing probably only need
[1182.64 - 1184.88] one
[1182.96 - 1186.48] this is a really big cucumber right here
[1184.88 - 1188.00] so i'm probably gonna only need one here
[1186.48 - 1192.88] so that's what i'll do i'll use this one
[1188.00 - 1196.24] that i'm cutting now
[1192.88 - 1197.04] so all these things matter the details
[1196.24 - 1200.24] matter when
[1197.04 - 1203.12] you're getting better every single
[1200.24 - 1204.72] break you can get in your body can get
[1203.12 - 1206.80] is a big deal
[1204.72 - 1208.56] so people say well why do you support
[1206.80 - 1209.92] traditional medicinals so much there's
[1208.56 - 1210.48] there's hundreds of tea companies out
[1209.92 - 1212.32] there now
[1210.48 - 1213.68] it's because i can't trust them they got
[1212.32 - 1215.52] a track record of not putting natural
[1213.68 - 1217.12] flavors in all these years
[1215.52 - 1219.28] unless they change that track record but
[1217.12 - 1220.24] they haven't so that's the natalie tea
[1219.28 - 1223.92] right
[1220.24 - 1226.00] traditional medicinals and so it's it's
[1223.92 - 1227.52] it's like why i don't want to jump to
[1226.00 - 1228.88] another tea company unless they can
[1227.52 - 1231.84] really promise me
[1228.88 - 1232.48] or show me a track record because teas
[1231.84 - 1235.60] are all
[1232.48 - 1237.20] getting natural flavors now natural
[1235.60 - 1239.28] flavorings of different kinds
[1237.20 - 1240.56] you go to a restaurant hey can i have a
[1239.28 - 1241.84] chamomile tea
[1240.56 - 1244.40] it's going to have natural flavoring in
[1241.84 - 1246.16] it you go can i have peppermint tea
[1244.40 - 1247.44] you just had a nice dinner you're with a
[1246.16 - 1249.36] friend and
[1247.44 - 1251.04] you want some herbal tea even though
[1249.36 - 1252.64] everybody's like have matcha tea
[1251.04 - 1254.56] afterwards so they get jacked up on
[1252.64 - 1257.60] caffeine and their adrenals are like
[1254.56 - 1259.68] oh my god help right but you can order
[1257.60 - 1262.56] some say or order some herbal tea
[1259.68 - 1262.88] it's gonna have natural flavoring in it
[1262.56 - 1264.72] so
[1262.88 - 1266.72] traditional medicinals doesn't that's
[1264.72 - 1268.88] why i like that one the vimergy products
[1266.72 - 1270.32] don't and never did and that's one
[1268.88 - 1271.28] reason why i like them it's one out of
[1270.32 - 1274.48] many
[1271.28 - 1274.48] so it's important
[1275.68 - 1280.32] b12 is infamous for having natural
[1278.32 - 1283.04] flavoring of some kind in there
[1280.32 - 1283.36] truly is so i'm gonna cut this right
[1283.04 - 1285.92] here
[1283.36 - 1287.60] so the first of all i'm gonna cut the
[1285.92 - 1290.72] cucumber in half
[1287.60 - 1291.28] like that okay and then i'm going to cut
[1290.72 - 1293.44] these like
[1291.28 - 1295.60] half moons is going to do and i'm not
[1293.44 - 1297.84] going to cut them too big but yet
[1295.60 - 1300.80] just about the right size here a little
[1297.84 - 1303.20] a little bit more than a quarter inch
[1300.80 - 1306.08] by almost a half inch each one that's
[1303.20 - 1306.08] what i'm doing right here
[1306.32 - 1308.88] you guys there's something that's really
[1307.44 - 1310.00] important with cutting boards just
[1308.88 - 1311.44] letting you know no matter what kind of
[1310.00 - 1314.24] cutting board you use
[1311.44 - 1315.44] this is a real i use wooden ones right
[1314.24 - 1317.44] but
[1315.44 - 1319.60] this is this is not the wooden one you
[1317.44 - 1321.84] can see right it's the plastic
[1319.60 - 1322.80] and the reason why i do that is because
[1321.84 - 1324.88] i have it arched
[1322.80 - 1326.32] out it's halfway off the counter and if
[1324.88 - 1327.12] i use the wooden one it would just fall
[1326.32 - 1328.72] down in
[1327.12 - 1330.24] i use it because it's part of the studio
[1328.72 - 1332.00] i set up in here right so i'm putting
[1330.24 - 1335.28] these cucumber slices
[1332.00 - 1336.24] on top of the salad i see people when
[1335.28 - 1338.16] they're cutting
[1336.24 - 1339.76] what they do is they scrape their boards
[1338.16 - 1342.80] with the sharp part of their knife
[1339.76 - 1345.04] so after they they cut something they
[1342.80 - 1346.56] they scrape their board whether it's
[1345.04 - 1347.04] wood or something you don't want to do
[1346.56 - 1349.52] that
[1347.04 - 1351.04] all you're doing is scraping tiny fibers
[1349.52 - 1353.68] of wood off your board
[1351.04 - 1354.48] tiny fibers of plastic tiny fibers of
[1353.68 - 1355.60] glass
[1354.48 - 1357.28] so you don't want to do that with your
[1355.60 - 1359.20] knife you want to flip your knife around
[1357.28 - 1359.60] and use this side which is not the sharp
[1359.20 - 1361.92] side
[1359.60 - 1363.12] to actually do this on your board i see
[1361.92 - 1365.84] it all the time and i want to let you
[1363.12 - 1365.84] guys know too
[1367.60 - 1372.00] uh b senior says is that way some
[1370.32 - 1374.40] so-called herbal teas
[1372.00 - 1376.40] made me feel sick it's very possible
[1374.40 - 1380.24] it's very possible
[1376.40 - 1382.16] because there's there there's also a lot
[1380.24 - 1386.16] of heavy metals and herbs
[1382.16 - 1388.88] out there a lot a lot of heavy metals
[1386.16 - 1389.68] and herbs letting you guys know that's
[1388.88 - 1392.40] one thing
[1389.68 - 1393.20] that slips the the radar not every
[1392.40 - 1394.64] company
[1393.20 - 1396.40] there's very few companies that do
[1394.64 - 1398.56] independent testing very
[1396.40 - 1400.24] it's very few if any and what i like
[1398.56 - 1402.16] about vimergy to do independent testing
[1400.24 - 1406.56] but herbs out there
[1402.16 - 1406.56] they're notorious um
[1409.04 - 1413.20] chinese medicine chinese herbs highest
[1411.60 - 1416.32] in heavy metals
[1413.20 - 1419.68] um there's just it always oh
[1416.32 - 1422.24] always had heavy metals known for it
[1419.68 - 1426.32] known for it for decades known for it in
[1422.24 - 1426.32] the 90s known for in the 2000s
[1428.72 - 1432.96] you want the lowest metals that's what
[1431.28 - 1434.80] it is the lowest metals because there's
[1432.96 - 1436.40] metals in every single thing you eat
[1434.80 - 1436.80] every herb you take there's the metals
[1436.40 - 1438.16] and it
[1436.80 - 1440.96] falls out of the sky it's in the water
[1438.16 - 1444.00] that feeds everything but
[1440.96 - 1446.96] um and natural flavorings have metals
[1444.00 - 1448.64] in there they have more than just msg so
[1446.96 - 1451.36] natural flavoring isn't just
[1448.64 - 1452.64] monosodium glutamate it's not just that
[1451.36 - 1456.00] it's
[1452.64 - 1458.80] it's msg is also a
[1456.00 - 1459.76] like a combination some toxic heavy
[1458.80 - 1462.24] metals
[1459.76 - 1463.44] aluminum that's a big one in natural
[1462.24 - 1465.28] flavors
[1463.44 - 1466.80] so when you have a package and it says
[1465.28 - 1468.72] organic natural flavors boom you just
[1466.80 - 1471.44] got a heavy metal dose
[1468.72 - 1472.56] boom you just got an msg dose symbols up
[1471.44 - 1474.88] like that
[1472.56 - 1476.72] so wouldn't you like to know or am i
[1474.88 - 1478.48] wasting your time
[1476.72 - 1480.56] hopefully i'm not wasting your time got
[1478.48 - 1483.76] some bananas
[1480.56 - 1487.60] you know i'd want to know
[1483.76 - 1489.12] right i mean
[1487.60 - 1490.24] so let's get some bananas in the salad
[1489.12 - 1490.96] and we're going to put some other things
[1490.24 - 1495.20] in here too
[1490.96 - 1495.20] you guys i think four bananas should
[1498.84 - 1502.56] work
[1500.80 - 1505.52] when it comes down to healing knowledge
[1502.56 - 1507.84] is power but if you're not
[1505.52 - 1509.84] informed on something that's under the
[1507.84 - 1513.04] wire that's hidden
[1509.84 - 1517.60] that's secret i remember doing a lecture
[1513.04 - 1520.88] in 2014 was before book one came out
[1517.60 - 1523.36] there's a thousand people in the crowd
[1520.88 - 1525.36] i was doing a lecture and i opened up
[1523.36 - 1529.44] the lecture
[1525.36 - 1531.44] with how if we don't know
[1529.44 - 1533.20] something's happening so we can't make a
[1531.44 - 1535.44] choice to protect yourself
[1533.20 - 1537.20] what if we're not told what if it's
[1535.44 - 1537.60] hidden what if it's secret what if
[1537.20 - 1542.08] you've been
[1537.60 - 1545.20] tricked what if you've been duped
[1542.08 - 1549.52] and that's the case with natural flavors
[1545.20 - 1552.96] right there every single
[1549.52 - 1554.80] package now of food almost that we'll
[1552.96 - 1556.00] you'll see a natural flavoring somewhere
[1554.80 - 1558.00] in there
[1556.00 - 1560.00] go down the aisle look you'll be in the
[1558.00 - 1563.04] natural food store the health food store
[1560.00 - 1566.08] you'll see it so
[1563.04 - 1571.84] why should we worry about msg
[1566.08 - 1575.44] msg pockets it pockets inside the brain
[1571.84 - 1578.00] it collects on neurotransmitters
[1575.44 - 1579.12] it lowers your battery charge in your
[1578.00 - 1583.28] brain
[1579.12 - 1585.36] it reduces electricity in your brain
[1583.28 - 1587.68] it does some short circuiting similar to
[1585.36 - 1590.04] toxic heavy metals
[1587.68 - 1593.04] so if you're already was struggling with
[1590.04 - 1597.60] depersonalization
[1593.04 - 1599.44] adhd autism
[1597.60 - 1600.72] you got anxiety you're just getting your
[1599.44 - 1602.24] anxieties through the roof you got a
[1600.72 - 1603.92] nervousness
[1602.24 - 1605.52] you got you know some depression that's
[1603.92 - 1607.04] really really hard on you i'm putting
[1605.52 - 1609.20] some banana pieces and cut them in like
[1607.04 - 1613.44] these half moons right here
[1609.20 - 1617.04] msg can make or break
[1613.44 - 1619.52] make or break your healing process
[1617.04 - 1621.04] just like caffeine can you want to heal
[1619.52 - 1622.80] but you can't get quite to the finish
[1621.04 - 1624.08] line but you don't know why but nobody's
[1622.80 - 1625.60] telling you it's the caffeine you're
[1624.08 - 1626.48] doing whether it's matcha tea chocolate
[1625.60 - 1628.96] or coffee
[1626.48 - 1630.16] or espresso or green tea or some kind
[1628.96 - 1631.36] you don't know that that's what's
[1630.16 - 1634.80] holding you back it's
[1631.36 - 1636.32] make or break to the finish line
[1634.80 - 1638.00] i mean do you want to get to the finish
[1636.32 - 1639.12] line of healing or do you want to kind
[1638.00 - 1641.68] of wafer around
[1639.12 - 1643.44] and stay sick and then kind of try
[1641.68 - 1646.08] something else and hit some fads
[1643.44 - 1646.88] hit some trend go listen to some podcast
[1646.08 - 1650.08] person or
[1646.88 - 1650.96] hell in health and now you're like doing
[1650.08 - 1652.40] something else
[1650.96 - 1655.52] and you're really not going to the
[1652.40 - 1657.44] finish line you're not going all the way
[1655.52 - 1659.20] meanwhile you might not even know that
[1657.44 - 1661.36] medical media put out information about
[1659.20 - 1662.00] msg about natural flavoring a long time
[1661.36 - 1664.40] ago
[1662.00 - 1666.56] and people forget or people might not
[1664.40 - 1668.16] have read that chapter or something in
[1666.56 - 1669.36] the book that i was showing you earlier
[1668.16 - 1672.88] then you just kind of stay
[1669.36 - 1674.48] sick you get the migraines you stay up
[1672.88 - 1677.92] all night you got insomnia
[1674.48 - 1679.60] msg can create some wicked insomnia
[1677.92 - 1681.36] i'm not talking about the night you use
[1679.60 - 1684.48] msg
[1681.36 - 1684.48] not talking about that
[1684.64 - 1688.32] i'm talking about the fact that it
[1687.04 - 1690.24] builds up in the brain
[1688.32 - 1691.52] becomes a neuroantagonist stays there
[1690.24 - 1693.52] for a long time
[1691.52 - 1695.44] pockets of msg do some brain damage
[1693.52 - 1696.88] where eventually gets seen on an mri
[1695.44 - 1698.56] years and years and years down the road
[1696.88 - 1701.44] but they don't know that's msg causing a
[1698.56 - 1701.44] crystallization
[1701.68 - 1707.68] so let's go into that a little bit msg
[1704.16 - 1710.56] crystallizes in your brain tissue
[1707.68 - 1713.44] natural flavoring as harmful and
[1710.56 - 1715.52] harmless as it sounds
[1713.44 - 1716.72] will eventually become a problem as
[1715.52 - 1717.52] you're using in your diet for years and
[1716.72 - 1719.28] years and years
[1717.52 - 1721.12] you get an mri down the road when you're
[1719.28 - 1722.84] 70 years old and they see some white
[1721.12 - 1727.12] spots
[1722.84 - 1730.96] crystallizing because
[1727.12 - 1735.12] msg is
[1730.96 - 1737.68] is a compound that doesn't wash away
[1735.12 - 1740.32] stays in tissue builds up as the years
[1737.68 - 1740.32] go on
[1740.72 - 1745.20] and um i think you guys might want to
[1744.48 - 1748.48] save
[1745.20 - 1750.16] some money right now and maybe not have
[1748.48 - 1753.52] to go through all that medical
[1750.16 - 1755.52] testing in hell and back situations
[1753.52 - 1757.36] because msg is building up in your brain
[1755.52 - 1758.16] causing pockets i figured you guys might
[1757.36 - 1760.24] want to
[1758.16 - 1763.52] have a chance to not go there and at
[1760.24 - 1766.96] least check that one off the list right
[1763.52 - 1770.00] that would be great so
[1766.96 - 1772.96] putting some banana pieces in here
[1770.00 - 1775.68] let's thinly slice up some onion msg is

[1794.16 - 1798.64] 20 tons of msg liquid sitting in
[1796.80 - 1800.24] gigantic centrifuge in the middle of a
[1798.64 - 1803.52] chemical factory
[1800.24 - 1806.00] siphoning around what of the packages
[1803.52 - 1808.40] say raspberry flavor it's msg

[1844.32 - 1851.12] here really good question and exactly
[1846.32 - 1854.64] what's happening out there

[1883.92 - 1888.32] here on these onion slices
[1886.00 - 1890.56] i don't i don't like big hunks of onion
[1888.32 - 1892.24] inside this banana salad
[1890.56 - 1894.48] so i like just having these really thin
[1892.24 - 1895.84] slices you don't have to have a lot if
[1894.48 - 1898.64] you don't want to you can have a little
[1895.84 - 1899.28] bit this is an anti-pathogen food right
[1898.64 - 1901.36] here
[1899.28 - 1903.36] when you're eating onions if you can if
[1901.36 - 1906.80] you can stand onion
[1903.36 - 1908.80] the smell of onion onion on food
[1906.80 - 1910.80] you're already like using you're using
[1908.80 - 1912.24] an antiviral medicine
[1910.80 - 1914.64] that's what you're doing think about it
[1912.24 - 1920.48] right a sulfur and onion
[1914.64 - 1922.72] that's a viral killer bacterial killer
[1920.48 - 1924.32] so i'm just cutting in this half and
[1922.72 - 1926.16] just going down here like that there you
[1924.32 - 1928.88] go paper thin
[1926.16 - 1930.88] my eyes are going to run now your
[1928.88 - 1934.72] central nervous system
[1930.88 - 1938.64] is highly sensitive
[1934.72 - 1941.84] msg is an irritant
[1938.64 - 1944.88] an antagonist troublemaker
[1941.84 - 1948.24] causes a lot of trouble
[1944.88 - 1950.88] but you guys aren't on any msg no way
[1948.24 - 1953.44] you're just unnatural flavors which is
[1950.88 - 1953.44] msg
[1954.48 - 1960.40] what about when it says citric acid
[1957.68 - 1961.76] yeah stay away from citric acid it's
[1960.40 - 1962.32] another reason why i like the vimergy
[1961.76 - 1964.48] products
[1962.32 - 1966.16] it's another reason why i like say um
[1964.48 - 1968.00] traditional medicinals right here
[1966.16 - 1969.52] like with the vimergy you take a lid of
[1968.00 - 1971.36] energy you get the lemon balm you're not
[1969.52 - 1972.72] gonna see citric acid in here
[1971.36 - 1974.84] there's a couple of companies that are
[1972.72 - 1977.44] like prided in their vegan
[1974.84 - 1978.72] supplements vim is for anybody who's
[1977.44 - 1980.88] vegan not vegan
[1978.72 - 1982.00] whatever right animal protein whatever
[1980.88 - 1982.88] but there's a couple like vegan
[1982.00 - 1984.48] companies
[1982.88 - 1986.08] they put they put products out there and
[1984.48 - 1988.48] they got citric acid in it
[1986.08 - 1989.28] and they think they got the best stuff
[1988.48 - 1991.52] they got
[1989.28 - 1993.52] casey a gum in there they got citric
[1991.52 - 1994.08] acid in there they got alcohol in there
[1993.52 - 1996.80] and
[1994.08 - 1997.60] and meanwhile they're on this hoo-ha you
[1996.80 - 2000.24] know rant
[1997.60 - 2002.16] that this stuff's the best and vegan
[2000.24 - 2002.88] vegan vegan and all that and it's like
[2002.16 - 2005.44] what
[2002.88 - 2007.12] you got citric acid in there that's corn
[2005.44 - 2009.04] citric acid is corn
[2007.12 - 2011.12] that's another trick happening right now
[2009.04 - 2014.72] citric acid is really bad citric acid
[2011.12 - 2015.52] isn't from a lemon it's not from an
[2014.72 - 2018.16] orange
[2015.52 - 2019.60] so i've got some slices thinly slices on
[2018.16 - 2021.44] top here
[2019.60 - 2022.64] that's not the citric acid you see in
[2021.44 - 2026.72] supplements
[2022.64 - 2028.64] so important to know okay got that
[2026.72 - 2030.00] optional is the onion but i like the
[2028.64 - 2031.28] onion so that's why i put it in this
[2030.00 - 2034.40] salad
[2031.28 - 2036.48] and optional is celery
[2034.40 - 2038.24] so i'm going to chop up some celery real
[2036.48 - 2040.88] thin slices of celery i'm going to put
[2038.24 - 2040.88] on top here
[2044.96 - 2048.32] carolina says i can't eat onion anymore
[2046.72 - 2049.36] you know there's phases you can go
[2048.32 - 2051.36] through in your life
[2049.36 - 2053.68] i've heard people say that absolutely
[2051.36 - 2056.48] and then they're back on in a few years
[2053.68 - 2058.48] they introduce it back so i'm going to
[2056.48 - 2060.80] put little pieces of celery on top
[2058.48 - 2062.88] it's going to look nice that way too i
[2060.80 - 2065.84] gotta make the dressing and i still have
[2062.88 - 2065.84] some dolls to go
[2070.96 - 2076.40] showing you what it looks like right now
[2075.04 - 2078.96] tina says can you speak more about
[2076.40 - 2081.28] adrenals i can so i got some little
[2078.96 - 2086.40] celery pieces on here i got the banana
[2081.28 - 2086.40] pieces this is the banana salad okay
[2086.56 - 2091.28] what's in this salad actually supports
[2088.32 - 2092.96] and feeds adrenals keep that in mind
[2091.28 - 2094.56] when it comes down to the celery pieces
[2092.96 - 2096.08] really good for your adrenals romaine
[2094.56 - 2097.76] lettuce great for the adrenals mineral
[2096.08 - 2101.92] salts critical for your adrenals
[2097.76 - 2103.28] right onion i'm gonna do the dolls
[2101.92 - 2104.56] cucumber which is really good for
[2103.28 - 2108.24] adrenals
[2104.56 - 2109.68] um so this is atlantic dulce right here
[2108.24 - 2110.88] you see guys i'm just showing you what i
[2109.68 - 2113.12] got here
[2110.88 - 2114.80] so you can moisten it and put it on you
[2113.12 - 2117.04] can put it on dry i'm going to moisten
[2114.80 - 2120.24] it for this recipe so
[2117.04 - 2121.76] what i do is
[2120.24 - 2123.60] i'll leave it in a bowl like this and
[2121.76 - 2126.72] add a little touch of water
[2123.60 - 2127.60] real quick i just added a little bit of
[2126.72 - 2129.84] water
[2127.60 - 2131.60] not a lot just mixing it up a little bit
[2129.84 - 2133.20] just get it kind of moist
[2131.60 - 2135.28] you don't want to soak it because then
[2133.20 - 2138.40] you start losing some of its flavor
[2135.28 - 2139.92] if you soak it soak it so
[2138.40 - 2142.00] keep that in mind it's a great way to
[2139.92 - 2143.76] keep your dolls just so flavorful
[2142.00 - 2146.80] right just mixing that up so i'm going
[2143.76 - 2146.80] to put some strips
[2147.28 - 2150.56] on the cutting board and cut it
[2152.80 - 2158.72] pop that on top there we go
[2156.40 - 2160.16] do that now when it comes down to
[2158.72 - 2162.24] adrenals you don't want to intermittent
[2160.16 - 2163.60] fast unless
[2162.24 - 2165.68] you're doing like the medical medium
[2163.60 - 2167.84] morning cleanse which is
[2165.68 - 2169.44] your lemon water 16 to 30 ounces lemon
[2167.84 - 2171.20] water in the morning then you go to 16
[2169.44 - 2173.04] to 32 ounces half an hour later of
[2171.20 - 2174.48] celery juice
[2173.04 - 2175.92] you do that next then you do like a
[2174.48 - 2177.76] smoothie medical medium smoothie heavy
[2175.92 - 2178.80] metal detox smoothie is a great option
[2177.76 - 2180.24] and then you can have a little bit of
[2178.80 - 2180.96] fruit with some fruit snacks or
[2180.24 - 2182.80] something
[2180.96 - 2184.24] or some celery sticks and fruit all the
[2182.80 - 2186.72] way up until lunch
[2184.24 - 2188.00] lunch and after you can bring in a fat
[2186.72 - 2189.84] if you want
[2188.00 - 2192.32] or you can bring in some oatmeal you can
[2189.84 - 2194.48] bring in some millet but the point is
[2192.32 - 2196.40] is that if you're intermittent fasting
[2194.48 - 2198.32] and you got adrenal issues
[2196.40 - 2199.76] you're hurting your adrenals you got to
[2198.32 - 2201.52] be really careful especially if you're
[2199.76 - 2203.68] intermittent fasting and dropping the
[2201.52 - 2204.08] caffeine in someone's telling you to do
[2203.68 - 2205.44] calf
[2204.08 - 2207.12] someone's telling you that caffeine is
[2205.44 - 2208.24] really healthy for you meanwhile you're
[2207.12 - 2210.96] killing your adrenals and
[2208.24 - 2212.96] and no one no one's teaching you that i
[2210.96 - 2215.60] talked about that in the last couple of
[2212.96 - 2216.80] of lives chocolate it's another one
[2215.60 - 2218.08] they'll tell you chocolate's so good for
[2216.80 - 2220.72] you but you kill your adrenals
[2218.08 - 2222.24] you can't get adrenal fatigue better if
[2220.72 - 2224.96] you're doing chocolate
[2222.24 - 2224.96] just letting you know
[2225.36 - 2229.04] caffeine there's caffeine in chocolate
[2227.28 - 2229.76] gotta be concerned about that matcha tea
[2229.04 - 2231.52] green tea
[2229.76 - 2233.20] you can't get adrenals better if you
[2231.52 - 2235.76] have an adrenal issue on any level
[2233.20 - 2236.56] you can't get adrenals better if you're
[2235.76 - 2238.88] doing
[2236.56 - 2240.08] any kind of chocolate espresso coffee
[2238.88 - 2241.52] matcha tea
[2240.08 - 2242.88] and then the same thing with high fat
[2241.52 - 2244.00] diets you gotta be careful how much
[2242.88 - 2245.52] fat's in your diet
[2244.00 - 2247.60] are you doing chicken twice a day you're
[2245.52 - 2249.20] doing it you're doing um
[2247.60 - 2250.88] you're doing bacon you're doing chicken
[2249.20 - 2252.00] are you doing too much nut butters tons
[2250.88 - 2254.48] of peanut butter uh
[2252.00 - 2255.84] you know chocolate what are you doing
[2254.48 - 2257.52] how many fats are you doing you do an
[2255.84 - 2258.88] avocado toast and then for lunch you
[2257.52 - 2260.24] have chicken on your salad
[2258.88 - 2261.52] then later in the afternoon you eat a
[2260.24 - 2263.04] chocolate bar then at night you have
[2261.52 - 2263.60] more chicken or you have something else
[2263.04 - 2265.76] right
[2263.60 - 2267.36] and then you have oil somewhere on all
[2265.76 - 2267.92] the stuff so there's so much fat in
[2267.36 - 2270.08] there
[2267.92 - 2271.92] you then then you you also kill the
[2270.08 - 2273.12] adrenals over time the adrenals can't
[2271.92 - 2275.36] keep up with that because
[2273.12 - 2277.04] your adrenals have to spill out all this
[2275.36 - 2278.00] epinephrine to thin out your blood
[2277.04 - 2280.32] because your heart
[2278.00 - 2281.76] is like oh my god if you keep on putting
[2280.32 - 2284.16] fat inside my bloodstream
[2281.76 - 2285.84] all day long every day i'm going to give
[2284.16 - 2287.60] out on you that's that's the whole point
[2285.84 - 2289.20] the heart and the brain they work
[2287.60 - 2291.28] together and they're saying stop the
[2289.20 - 2293.36] fats stop the fats
[2291.28 - 2295.04] and a way to bring your adrenals back is
[2293.36 - 2296.64] to actually eat every hour
[2295.04 - 2298.32] hour and a half to two hours depending
[2296.64 - 2300.08] on how bad your adrenals are
[2298.32 - 2301.68] have an apple and some celery have some
[2300.08 - 2304.64] dates and some celery sticks
[2301.68 - 2306.56] have a couple of oranges have a banana
[2304.64 - 2306.88] and some celery banana and some lettuce
[2306.56 - 2308.32] so
[2306.88 - 2310.80] there's all these different combinations
[2308.32 - 2313.60] i call them adrenal snacks
[2310.80 - 2315.20] and it what it does is it replaces your
[2313.60 - 2316.64] blood sugar so adrenaline doesn't have
[2315.20 - 2318.16] to replace your blood sugar so i'll just
[2316.64 - 2320.08] run this by you real quick
[2318.16 - 2321.28] so when you don't eat and too many hours
[2320.08 - 2323.04] go by
[2321.28 - 2324.80] you you drop your blood sugar blood
[2323.04 - 2327.84] sugar drops right
[2324.80 - 2328.56] and then your poor adrenals they have to
[2327.84 - 2330.40] pour out
[2328.56 - 2331.60] all this adrenaline just dump out all
[2330.40 - 2333.92] this adrenaline
[2331.60 - 2335.52] because adrenaline takes place of blood
[2333.92 - 2337.52] sugar when blood sugar is missing
[2335.52 - 2339.12] adrenaline have the adrenals try to
[2337.52 - 2340.64] become blood sugar
[2339.12 - 2342.24] and then you wear them out you wear them
[2340.64 - 2343.60] out you wear them out and no one teaches
[2342.24 - 2345.36] you how to knot and then you're just
[2343.60 - 2348.00] adrenal fatigue later on and then
[2345.36 - 2350.08] then you lose the hair for women they
[2348.00 - 2352.40] all lose their hair their hair thins
[2350.08 - 2354.56] their their skin ages they get the
[2352.40 - 2355.28] wrinkles they get the hard childbirths
[2354.56 - 2358.32] they get
[2355.28 - 2360.32] they get the um you know they get
[2358.32 - 2362.08] difficult they can even get miscarriages
[2360.32 - 2363.68] they can get the adrenals just start
[2362.08 - 2365.84] getting all beat up
[2363.68 - 2367.04] um you get the hormone imbalances
[2365.84 - 2369.44] constantly
[2367.04 - 2371.36] and all these things happen then you get
[2369.44 - 2371.84] all the sun spots the skin ages you
[2371.36 - 2373.68] gotta
[2371.84 - 2375.68] then everybody's running to get botox
[2373.68 - 2378.40] and all these other problems
[2375.68 - 2379.36] and there's a whole adrenal section in
[2378.40 - 2381.04] medical medium
[2379.36 - 2384.16] the new addition so make sure you get
[2381.04 - 2384.16] that and you check it out
[2385.20 - 2388.88] when dulce gets wet it makes a mess
[2388.96 - 2394.80] what causes high cortisol
[2392.16 - 2395.44] high fat diet is one thing right there
[2394.80 - 2397.04] so
[2395.44 - 2399.28] too many fats in the diet every single
[2397.04 - 2399.92] day high cortisol caffeine is the
[2399.28 - 2403.36] biggest
[2399.92 - 2406.40] high cortisol causer there is chocolate
[2403.36 - 2407.52] biggest high cortisol causer there is is
[2406.40 - 2410.48] caffeine
[2407.52 - 2411.92] when you do caffeine you annihilate your
[2410.48 - 2414.64] adrenal glands
[2411.92 - 2415.12] annihilate them and no one wants to talk
[2414.64 - 2416.64] about it
[2415.12 - 2418.80] everybody wants to pretend it's fine and
[2416.64 - 2419.92] good i notice that the podcast doctors
[2418.80 - 2420.88] want to pretend it's fine and good
[2419.92 - 2422.16] because they don't want to
[2420.88 - 2424.40] they don't want to stop their caffeine
[2422.16 - 2429.04] addiction they love it and
[2424.40 - 2430.88] i noticed that um men in health
[2429.04 - 2432.64] they don't know women's health is
[2430.88 - 2434.40] different they just don't
[2432.64 - 2436.00] they don't they think women should be
[2434.40 - 2437.76] following the lead of men
[2436.00 - 2439.12] that's what they believe so all the
[2437.76 - 2440.48] health gurus that are men they just
[2439.12 - 2442.08] think women should be following whatever
[2440.48 - 2445.12] they're doing you know what i mean
[2442.08 - 2446.72] and they don't know that women's
[2445.12 - 2449.28] adrenals are designed differently
[2446.72 - 2451.12] because women's adrenals produce all the
[2449.28 - 2454.72] progesterone i'll produce all the
[2451.12 - 2458.00] the estrogen produce reproductive system
[2454.72 - 2458.64] hormones right men's adrenals don't do
[2458.00 - 2461.28] that
[2458.64 - 2462.24] so you know and and men don't have to
[2461.28 - 2464.48] have babies
[2462.24 - 2466.00] they don't have babies so what happens
[2464.48 - 2467.44] is that men's adrenals are entirely
[2466.00 - 2469.84] different than women's adrenals and
[2467.44 - 2471.68] it also covers all of women's health
[2469.84 - 2473.84] entirely different than men's health
[2471.68 - 2476.24] but men will actually promote things
[2473.84 - 2477.60] that destroy women's health so men gurus
[2476.24 - 2479.44] and men podcast
[2477.60 - 2481.20] heroes and doctors and other people and
[2479.44 - 2484.32] health enthusiasts and trainers and
[2481.20 - 2485.92] and and health coaches they just promote
[2484.32 - 2487.04] things that hurt women's health in
[2485.92 - 2489.36] natural health
[2487.04 - 2490.80] conventional health too not everything
[2489.36 - 2492.48] but a lot of stuff
[2490.80 - 2493.92] i just just don't know i'm gonna give
[2492.48 - 2496.24] them some credit they have some stuff
[2493.92 - 2498.72] right here and there
[2496.24 - 2500.32] anyway so let's make let's make this
[2498.72 - 2503.84] let's make the dressing
[2500.32 - 2503.84] let's go there let me grab a bowl
[2505.52 - 2510.16] so let's make a dressing i'm gonna half
[2508.40 - 2512.16] a cup of orange
[2510.16 - 2514.80] juice got some oranges here probably do
[2512.16 - 2514.80] a little bit more
[2515.28 - 2521.52] when you go long hours
[2519.12 - 2523.28] of no food you're gonna get high
[2521.52 - 2525.84] cortisol
[2523.28 - 2527.68] long hours of no food now if you go long
[2525.84 - 2529.04] hours and in between those long hours is
[2527.68 - 2531.60] celery juice
[2529.04 - 2532.56] maybe a heavy metal detox smoothie maybe
[2531.60 - 2536.00] another smoothie
[2532.56 - 2538.48] maybe some lemon water maybe an apple
[2536.00 - 2540.00] that's different when you go long hours
[2538.48 - 2542.64] without food
[2540.00 - 2544.80] and then the food you choose is caffeine
[2542.64 - 2547.68] even if you don't choose caffeine or not
[2544.80 - 2548.48] you just kill your adrenals the cortisol
[2547.68 - 2550.08] that's how
[2548.48 - 2552.24] you literally get the high cortisol
[2550.08 - 2553.20] that's how you eventually high cortisol
[2552.24 - 2556.32] is a cry
[2553.20 - 2557.44] for help it's your adrenals crying for
[2556.32 - 2560.08] help
[2557.44 - 2560.88] it's saying stop whatever it is you're
[2560.08 - 2563.60] doing
[2560.88 - 2564.08] stop destroying me stop hurting me
[2563.60 - 2565.52] because
[2564.08 - 2567.12] you're going to have a shortened life
[2565.52 - 2569.84] because of it and that's what high
[2567.12 - 2572.96] cortisol is it's a warning sign
[2569.84 - 2575.44] for you to adhere and listen and
[2572.96 - 2576.80] hear not just adhere and it's like and
[2575.44 - 2581.20] you know it's really important
[2576.80 - 2584.40] so and that you know so much information
[2581.20 - 2587.52] i'm gonna squeeze some oranges by hand
[2584.40 - 2588.72] aren't oranges high in sugar mary meets
[2587.52 - 2591.12] high in sugar
[2588.72 - 2592.72] everything's high in sugar everything's
[2591.12 - 2597.28] high in sugar
[2592.72 - 2600.32] um the blood in meat
[2597.28 - 2604.32] is glucose so the cow's blood
[2600.32 - 2606.96] is sweet cow blood is sweet
[2604.32 - 2609.04] chicken blood is sweet it's actually
[2606.96 - 2612.16] really sweet
[2609.04 - 2613.12] it's all sugar so meat's filled every
[2612.16 - 2614.96] blood vessel
[2613.12 - 2616.64] in that meat is filled with sugar it's
[2614.96 - 2618.96] called glucose blood sugar
[2616.64 - 2621.04] so when you fry up that meat have that
[2618.96 - 2622.16] burger you're having a sugar bomb and
[2621.04 - 2624.40] fat bomb combined
[2622.16 - 2626.56] it's just that they chose not to tell
[2624.40 - 2629.20] you that part they chose not to measure
[2626.56 - 2629.20] that part
[2631.84 - 2636.80] your blood sugar is filled with sugar
[2634.80 - 2642.16] your blood is filled with sugar
[2636.80 - 2642.16] so everything has sugar in it
[2642.24 - 2648.32] but an orange has vitamin c in it
[2645.60 - 2648.72] phytochemical compounds calcium to stop
[2648.32 - 2651.36] your
[2648.72 - 2653.28] teeth from falling apart so you're not
[2651.36 - 2654.32] getting root canals and veneers and
[2653.28 - 2655.84] implants
[2654.32 - 2657.36] and getting drilled at the dentist all
[2655.84 - 2660.24] the time that's what
[2657.36 - 2661.76] oranges have meat doesn't have that and
[2660.24 - 2662.24] i'm not anti-meat if you want to eat
[2661.76 - 2665.52] meat
[2662.24 - 2666.24] meat at least doesn't feed bugs dairy
[2665.52 - 2668.24] does
[2666.24 - 2669.52] eggs feed bugs they feed bugs if you're
[2668.24 - 2670.88] like bugs what's he talking about i'm
[2669.52 - 2672.24] talking about the bugs inside your body
[2670.88 - 2675.44] that cause every single illness and
[2672.24 - 2678.56] aches and pains that you have
[2675.44 - 2681.60] eggs milk cheese dairy that will feed it
[2678.56 - 2682.96] but um
[2681.60 - 2684.88] making a little bit more orange juice
[2682.96 - 2688.00] here
[2684.88 - 2689.76] but yeah and
[2688.00 - 2691.76] and and it's not that there's too much
[2689.76 - 2692.72] sugar in in fruit that's not at all
[2691.76 - 2694.40] fruit's got
[2692.72 - 2696.00] living water in it phytochemical
[2694.40 - 2697.12] compounds it's got minerals trace
[2696.00 - 2698.80] minerals it's got nutrients it's got
[2697.12 - 2701.44] vitamins it's got all that in there
[2698.80 - 2701.44] pulp fiber
[2701.92 - 2708.32] fasting promotes longevity is that true
[2705.44 - 2709.04] fasting during a crisis can be very
[2708.32 - 2711.44] healing
[2709.04 - 2713.04] to allow your body to heal while in that
[2711.44 - 2716.84] crisis
[2713.04 - 2718.48] but short fasts one day two day three
[2716.84 - 2720.40] day
[2718.48 - 2721.84] you get food poisoning you can't eat the
[2720.40 - 2723.92] next day
[2721.84 - 2725.68] you'll just go downhill it's almost like
[2723.92 - 2726.56] best you can do is just sip a little
[2725.68 - 2728.40] something right
[2726.56 - 2730.08] so you're fasting so your body can fight
[2728.40 - 2730.80] whatever that foodborne pathogen and
[2730.08 - 2732.40] enter your body
[2730.80 - 2734.32] when you've got food poisoning see how
[2732.40 - 2735.68] it works short fast
[2734.32 - 2738.24] are healing in many ways i've talked
[2735.68 - 2741.36] about that but long
[2738.24 - 2745.76] long fasts where there's nothing but
[2741.36 - 2748.16] water starts to just drain you
[2745.76 - 2749.68] it starts to drain your trace minerals
[2748.16 - 2751.20] it starts to take minerals out of the
[2749.68 - 2752.88] bones over time
[2751.20 - 2754.40] it all depends on the person in the
[2752.88 - 2756.40] situation
[2754.40 - 2757.84] i noticed that if you got chronic
[2756.40 - 2759.84] illness you're suffering from chronic
[2757.84 - 2762.56] illness a long water fast is not
[2759.84 - 2762.56] ideal no
[2764.00 - 2766.24] and
[2768.72 - 2772.56] so that's something to think about just
[2770.16 - 2775.84] so you know anyway i got some orange
[2772.56 - 2775.84] juice here
[2776.96 - 2781.84] so when you do long time water fast long
[2779.44 - 2784.88] you know do long water fasts you do
[2781.84 - 2786.48] week 10 days 14 days 21 days no one
[2784.88 - 2788.00] knows what's happening inside of you
[2786.48 - 2788.96] they can't tell what's happening so i
[2788.00 - 2790.48] mean nobody
[2788.96 - 2792.16] nobody's going to know and how to
[2790.48 - 2793.68] measure anything in there it's not like
[2792.16 - 2795.36] how do you measure
[2793.68 - 2796.80] anything in there like how can you
[2795.36 - 2798.24] measure what happened to your adrenals
[2796.80 - 2799.52] during that water fast how can you
[2798.24 - 2801.12] measure anything and then you've got to
[2799.52 - 2802.72] recoup from that water fast and recoup
[2801.12 - 2804.96] from that water fast
[2802.72 - 2807.04] it's it i don't recommend the long water
[2804.96 - 2809.44] fasts i don't i don't because
[2807.04 - 2811.44] it's it's i recommend knowing why you're
[2809.44 - 2812.96] sick and not having to go that route
[2811.44 - 2814.80] that's something that hits
[2812.96 - 2816.08] when you're desperate and you don't
[2814.80 - 2817.44] really have anywhere to go
[2816.08 - 2819.68] and you don't know why you're sexy end
[2817.44 - 2822.16] up doing a long water fast
[2819.68 - 2823.60] but i recommend finding out why you're
[2822.16 - 2825.20] sick how about that so you don't have to
[2823.60 - 2826.48] do a water fast
[2825.20 - 2830.00] so let's do a little bit of honey in
[2826.48 - 2832.00] this dressing i'm gonna mix this up
[2830.00 - 2833.60] do about two teaspoons could do a
[2832.00 - 2834.56] tablespoon if you really want to in this
[2833.60 - 2837.92] dressing
[2834.56 - 2837.92] but i'm gonna like two teaspoons
[2838.08 - 2842.56] trina said i helped i felt so sick after
[2840.00 - 2844.88] two days of celery juice
[2842.56 - 2846.88] what else is going on in your life are
[2844.88 - 2848.24] you what foods are you doing
[2846.88 - 2849.92] what foods were you doing in those two
[2848.24 - 2850.88] days are you doing nutritional yeast are
[2849.92 - 2853.52] you doing vinegars
[2850.88 - 2855.52] so your vinegar free your apple cider
[2853.52 - 2857.68] vinegar free your vinegar's free of all
[2855.52 - 2861.04] kinds your nutritional yeast free
[2857.68 - 2862.56] you're you're caffeine free completely
[2861.04 - 2863.60] caffeine free so you don't do caffeine
[2862.56 - 2864.72] at all
[2863.60 - 2868.40] these are some of the things to think
[2864.72 - 2871.36] about here also
[2868.40 - 2872.96] celery juice were you doing it without
[2871.36 - 2874.56] lemon were you doing it by itself
[2872.96 - 2876.00] how many ounces of celery juice did you
[2874.56 - 2877.68] do that's another thing too
[2876.00 - 2879.76] did you buy it in a store did you juice
[2877.68 - 2881.36] it yourself was it hpp
[2879.76 - 2882.80] did you buy it in the store and it was
[2881.36 - 2884.88] high pressure pasteurization because
[2882.80 - 2888.48] that'll make you sick
[2884.88 - 2889.52] um you never had a symptom before that
[2888.48 - 2891.12] celery juice
[2889.52 - 2892.32] so you've never been sick so you're
[2891.12 - 2893.68] drinking celery juice because you're a
[2892.32 - 2895.92] healthy person with no problems and
[2893.68 - 2898.56] you're drinking celery juice because
[2895.92 - 2900.72] you just want to drink it or you
[2898.56 - 2901.52] actually have symptoms and you felt sick
[2900.72 - 2903.44] before like
[2901.52 - 2904.72] last week or two months ago or six
[2903.44 - 2905.68] months ago and you've been to all these
[2904.72 - 2907.36] different doctors
[2905.68 - 2909.20] it's just these are all questions to ask
[2907.36 - 2912.00] yourself to see where you stand
[2909.20 - 2913.84] and then kind of see if you can be your
[2912.00 - 2915.52] own detective and maybe you can try
[2913.84 - 2916.48] celery juice again someday you never
[2915.52 - 2917.92] know
[2916.48 - 2921.52] so i just put raw honey in here and i
[2917.92 - 2921.52] mixed it up with the orange juice
[2923.36 - 2929.04] are you really toxic really toxic
[2927.52 - 2930.72] did the celery juice hit the liver how
[2929.04 - 2932.08] much did you drink
[2930.72 - 2934.00] celery just gets into the liver and
[2932.08 - 2935.92] fleshes out all this stuff
[2934.00 - 2937.60] so here's the salad right here it's
[2935.92 - 2939.92] really pretty like this
[2937.60 - 2942.24] um so you see the little slight the thin
[2939.92 - 2942.88] sliced onions i got the little dolls on
[2942.24 - 2944.56] top
[2942.88 - 2946.00] pieces of dolls i got the banana all
[2944.56 - 2948.24] intermixed with the little celery
[2946.00 - 2950.24] and everything else heavy ass is
[2948.24 - 2951.52] nutritional yeast bad it's terrible it's
[2950.24 - 2952.72] got msg
[2951.52 - 2956.08] now this whole thing we're talking about
[2952.72 - 2957.92] msg every this whole thing about it
[2956.08 - 2960.40] nutritional yeast they say nutritional
[2957.92 - 2963.92] yeast will have b12 in it
[2960.40 - 2966.40] and wrong they add it
[2963.92 - 2968.08] and they add a really bad one they add a
[2966.40 - 2972.88] really bad one to
[2968.08 - 2972.88] the nutritional yeast um
[2973.68 - 2977.20] jane says intermittent fasting is
[2975.36 - 2980.16] supposed to be good for type 1
[2977.20 - 2981.20] type 2 diabetes sorry type 2 diabetes i
[2980.16 - 2983.84] stopped doing it
[2981.20 - 2984.72] and then gained a few pounds i don't
[2983.84 - 2987.28] want to go back
[2984.72 - 2987.84] fasting but it did help me maintain my
[2987.28 - 2991.36] weight
[2987.84 - 2994.40] which is 57 is more um
[2991.36 - 2995.92] which at 57 is more important than me um
[2994.40 - 2998.16] you don't have to intermittent fast to
[2995.92 - 2998.88] get your weight down why don't you once
[2998.16 - 3000.80] you um
[2998.88 - 3002.32] learn how to lower your fats that's one
[3000.80 - 3003.28] thing right there that's that's the
[3002.32 - 3004.72] whole thing there too
[3003.28 - 3006.16] what happens is the reason why i was
[3004.72 - 3007.68] helping you is because you got rid of
[3006.16 - 3009.36] your fats in the morning
[3007.68 - 3010.72] that's what it did the worst thing for
[3009.36 - 3012.80] diabetics
[3010.72 - 3014.16] hear me out everybody here i mean this
[3012.80 - 3015.68] is good for if you know somebody who's a
[3014.16 - 3017.20] diabetic this is really good emphasis
[3015.68 - 3020.32] you might want to hear this
[3017.20 - 3022.40] um when it comes down to diabetes the
[3020.32 - 3024.08] worst thing you could ever do is eat a
[3022.40 - 3028.24] fat in the morning so bacon
[3024.08 - 3031.44] and egg cheese butter milk avocado
[3028.24 - 3031.92] nuts seed oils any of that in the
[3031.44 - 3033.92] morning
[3031.92 - 3034.96] is the worst thing you can do as a
[3033.92 - 3037.12] diabetic
[3034.96 - 3039.52] because all that does is it keeps on
[3037.12 - 3040.00] compiling on that insulin resistance and
[3039.52 - 3041.76] keeps on
[3040.00 - 3043.28] creating that insulin resistance and
[3041.76 - 3044.88] insulin it's the fats
[3043.28 - 3046.64] fats first thing in the morning or mid
[3044.88 - 3048.16] morning it's all those fats that
[3046.64 - 3049.20] actually cause the reason why you were
[3048.16 - 3050.64] getting a little better and dropping
[3049.20 - 3052.16] some weights is because you gave your
[3050.64 - 3054.40] liver a break
[3052.16 - 3056.00] and you stopped eating fats in the
[3054.40 - 3057.84] morning that's all that was it's not
[3056.00 - 3060.88] like intermittent fasting is this
[3057.84 - 3062.96] is this this incredible thing
[3060.88 - 3064.40] oh my god i found the holy grail
[3062.96 - 3065.92] intermittent fasting no
[3064.40 - 3068.00] all it is is you stopped your fats in
[3065.92 - 3069.44] the morning that's all it was
[3068.00 - 3070.88] i mean you don't have to intermittent
[3069.44 - 3072.00] fast you'd be like wake up one morning
[3070.88 - 3073.52] but like you know what
[3072.00 - 3075.12] i'm gonna do medical medium stuff and
[3073.52 - 3076.16] stop my fats in the morning i'm not
[3075.12 - 3078.00] gonna down all this
[3076.16 - 3079.44] milk cheese butter bacon eggs oils
[3078.00 - 3080.80] peanut butter peanut butter in the
[3079.44 - 3081.28] morning peanut butter and oatmeal in the
[3080.80 - 3083.28] morning
[3081.28 - 3086.24] even oatmeal is high in fat oatmeal
[3083.28 - 3088.80] itself so imagine putting fat on it
[3086.24 - 3090.24] so what happens is you guys is that that
[3088.80 - 3091.52] just gives you insulin resistance so
[3090.24 - 3093.36] when you get rid of that
[3091.52 - 3094.96] as a diabetic you're going to be like
[3093.36 - 3096.96] whoa i'm losing some weight because your
[3094.96 - 3098.80] liver is recouping it's starting to
[3096.96 - 3100.24] survive again you're not
[3098.80 - 3103.76] killing it with fats you're not
[3100.24 - 3103.76] bombarding it with fats
[3104.00 - 3107.76] if you did this banana salad like mid
[3106.64 - 3110.24] mid morning
[3107.76 - 3111.76] and did some celery juice early morning
[3110.24 - 3113.36] and some lemon water and then you
[3111.76 - 3114.40] decided to do the banana salad somewhere
[3113.36 - 3116.32] around mid-morning
[3114.40 - 3117.92] you already would be losing the weight
[3116.32 - 3119.36] because you're not bombarding your liver
[3117.92 - 3122.24] with fats
[3119.36 - 3123.60] and all my books talk about diabetes so
[3122.24 - 3124.16] medical medium new addition there's a
[3123.60 - 3126.08] diabetes

[3166.48 - 3168.16] guys want to come over going to talk
[3167.68 - 3171.04] more
[3168.16 - 3172.80] about everything keep in mind about the
[3171.04 - 3173.28] natural flavors whatever you do protect
[3172.80 - 3176.40] yourself
[3173.28 - 3177.52] look out it's important
[3176.40 - 3179.36] if you're looking for teas without
[3177.52 - 3180.48] natural flavoring boom you got the
[3179.36 - 3182.72] traditional medicinals
[3180.48 - 3184.00] not sponsored looking for supplements
[3182.72 - 3185.76] without natural flavoring
[3184.00 - 3187.36] that's critical like the curcumin or
[3185.76 - 3189.84] anything from memorgy
[3187.36 - 3191.20] no natural flavors keep that in mind
[3189.84 - 3191.84] they're actually smart enough to know
[3191.20 - 3193.92] that
[3191.84 - 3195.12] and that right there says everything
[3193.92 - 3197.12] because companies all
[3195.12 - 3198.88] use natural flavors they got msg and all
[3197.12 - 3201.36] their stuff out there look out
[3198.88 - 3202.96] it's a trick and all it does is just
[3201.36 - 3204.84] take you down the wrong path
