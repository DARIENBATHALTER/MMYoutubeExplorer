[1.96 - 6.56] talking about neurological problems
[3.84 - 8.64] brain issues because let's face it I
[6.56 - 11.56] don't know if you guys are seeing it but
[8.64 - 13.56] everybody's brains are going to out
[11.56 - 15.36] there there's no doubt about it you can
[13.56 - 16.84] see it out there you can talk to people
[15.36 - 20.24] out there you can see how things
[16.84 - 22.72] function or work and everybody's getting
[20.24 - 24.80] tripped up people's brains are not
[22.72 - 26.24] functioning like they should I want to
[24.80 - 28.24] make an announcement before I head into
[26.24 - 30.76] that I'm also going to talk about Foods
[28.24 - 32.32] a little bit right Troublemaker Foods
[30.76 - 34.36] foods that are problematic why they're
[32.32 - 35.92] problematic you'll see I got assorted
[34.36 - 38.32] amounts of foods right here in front of
[35.92 - 42.60] me but I want to make an announcement
[38.32 - 46.28] the Cafe Gratitude medical medium
[42.60 - 50.00] collaboration popup dinners for October
[46.28 - 53.60] 22nd October 23rd are sold out they were
[50.00 - 56.12] sold out before I can even get them out
[53.60 - 58.80] there the link out there to even make
[56.12 - 62.88] the announcement so so what happened was
[58.80 - 65.04] the link leaked out somehow somebody
[62.88 - 68.00] found it maybe they sleuthed it maybe
[65.04 - 71.80] they found it somewhere but the link got
[68.00 - 73.96] out it leaked out because tomorrow I was
[71.80 - 75.40] going to make the announcement so that
[73.96 - 77.44] everybody knew about it I Was preparing
[75.40 - 79.56] everybody look it's going to be tomorrow
[77.44 - 80.64] and you might want to actually be there
[79.56 - 82.32] because it's going to be a meet and
[80.64 - 84.20] greet with me it's going to be an
[82.32 - 86.44] intimate setting it's just in the
[84.20 - 87.76] restaurant Cafe Gratitude and I'm going
[86.44 - 89.20] to be there and it's going to be really
[87.76 - 90.48] cool it's going to be a lot of great
[89.20 - 92.52] stuff happening
[90.48 - 95.60] but I didn't even get a chance to even
[92.52 - 97.60] go into any of it the link was thrown
[95.60 - 100.08] around or spread around it got into some
[97.60 - 103.44] groups or somewhere else and that was it
[100.08 - 105.20] the tickets were all sold in literally
[103.44 - 107.64] uh two or 3 minutes or something
[105.20 - 109.68] ridiculous like that so I just I mean
[107.64 - 111.72] it's crazy it's actually crazy but it
[109.68 - 113.56] happened I can't do anything about it
[111.72 - 116.76] and I feel bad for anybody who is
[113.56 - 118.24] waiting tomorrow or anybody who's on the
[116.76 - 120.68] other side of the world and they're
[118.24 - 122.88] asleep right now so that another thing
[120.68 - 125.80] too I was a little worried about is that
[122.88 - 127.68] there's a whole bunch of people that uh
[125.80 - 130.64] probably would have come that are on the
[127.68 - 132.84] other side of the world all in bed you
[130.64 - 134.64] know snoozing and snuggling and they're
[132.84 - 136.20] going to wake up in the morning their
[134.64 - 138.64] morning their morning and they're going
[136.20 - 140.84] to see what happened it's not even being
[138.64 - 143.80] launched there's no launch or anything
[140.84 - 149.40] like that lra over there YouTube says no
[143.80 - 151.36] this is so sad we had we had a launch
[149.40 - 153.68] link that was going to be used for
[151.36 - 156.64] tomorrow all these things and it didn't
[153.68 - 160.40] happen someone got the link and passed
[156.64 - 162.48] it around and so we had to then release
[160.40 - 164.12] whatever we had to release that we had
[162.48 - 166.48] that was for tomorrow but we had to do
[164.12 - 168.08] it today so anyway that was just what I
[166.48 - 171.60] wanted to tell you by the way anybody
[168.08 - 174.92] who did get a ticket for the Cafe
[171.60 - 178.16] Gratitude medical medium pop-up dinner
[174.92 - 182.00] is going to be stoked is going to be
[178.16 - 185.44] totally totally psyched for October 22nd
[182.00 - 187.80] October 23rd you can join the wait list
[185.44 - 190.24] though there are weit lists for both
[187.80 - 193.40] restaurants because it's October 22nd is

[206.40 - 211.40] really cool there like that but anyway
[209.16 - 214.20] that's what happened it's shocking
[211.40 - 216.68] totally shocking I'm I'm in shock
[214.20 - 219.00] because it happened in seconds like in
[216.68 - 221.68] seconds like 3 minutes it was just
[219.00 - 224.12] seconds basically I don't know what it
[221.68 - 225.96] was like 240 seconds or something like
[224.12 - 228.32] that and it was all gone that's what it
[225.96 - 229.76] that's what it seemed like October 15th
[228.32 - 231.88] though I do want to say this before we
[229.76 - 233.64] go into brain problems and neurological
[231.88 - 234.92] issues and everything in foods and stuff
[233.64 - 236.16] like that as you guys could see we're
[234.92 - 237.64] going to talk about and I got the brains
[236.16 - 239.44] saer books right here so this is really
[237.64 - 243.44] cool before we go into that I just want
[239.44 - 246.80] to say that this that at Cafe Gratitude

[285.04 - 288.96] really exciting this is really exciting
[287.04 - 290.64] it's something that I I couldn't wait to
[288.96 - 292.96] release and launch and I was doing it
[290.64 - 294.48] tomorrow but like I said before if
[292.96 - 298.32] you're you know wondering what's going
[294.48 - 300.88] on or what happened the link escaped
[298.32 - 303.28] somehow or somebody got the link somehow
[300.88 - 306.60] they found it and they passed it around
[303.28 - 309.52] and it was sold out just in a literally
[306.60 - 312.04] in a second not literally in a second
[309.52 - 312.96] but three minutes anyway all right so I
[312.04 - 314.64] want to talk a little bit about
[312.96 - 316.44] neurological brain and everything and
[314.64 - 318.84] then I'll just remind everybody in case
[316.44 - 321.04] somebody comes on and goes what happened
[318.84 - 323.24] yeah it's it's it's crazy it's
[321.04 - 324.56] crazy so I'm going to talk about Foods a
[323.24 - 325.96] little bit but I'm also going to talk
[324.56 - 328.48] about brain problems because I don't
[325.96 - 332.08] know if you guys are seeing it out there
[328.48 - 335.04] right uh um anyway Spirit of compassion
[332.08 - 336.76] told me back what was it five years ago
[335.04 - 339.08] four and a half years ago or something
[336.76 - 342.16] like that that there was going to be
[339.08 - 343.92] this onslaught of just
[342.16 - 345.32] deterioration um people getting
[343.92 - 347.08] chronically ill in so many ways
[345.32 - 349.24] neurologically and so forth and it was
[347.08 - 350.84] going to be just quite a ride and that's
[349.24 - 352.44] where it's heading and it is heading
[350.84 - 354.36] that way and you'll see me like there's
[352.44 - 357.32] studies out there like scientist say
[354.36 - 359.36] that 40% of the people now are have this
[357.32 - 360.52] or 60% of the people are getting sick
[359.36 - 362.20] with this this and that they've never
[360.52 - 366.32] seen anything like it's
[362.20 - 368.92] unprecedented yeah so you'll see that
[366.32 - 371.92] you'll see that out there and at the
[368.92 - 374.56] same time really the reality is it's
[371.92 - 376.84] more it's more it's more it's more
[374.56 - 379.64] people are getting sick they're getting
[376.84 - 382.76] brain sick it is
[379.64 - 385.60] disturbing it is disturbing a lot of on
[382.76 - 388.80] a lot of levels because when someone's
[385.60 - 390.40] brain is getting messed up for some
[388.80 - 391.64] reason or another we're going to cover
[390.40 - 394.84] some of those
[391.64 - 396.80] things it can open the door for anything
[394.84 - 399.00] all kinds of different problems so it's
[396.80 - 400.48] toxic heavy metals are really elevating
[399.00 - 402.32] like nobody's business in people's
[400.48 - 404.48] brains these days it's a whole another
[402.32 - 406.24] level right all that and what you'll see
[404.48 - 408.04] out there is this you'll see this now
[406.24 - 410.24] right this got popular forever chemicals
[408.04 - 412.60] forever chemicals pfas or whatever
[410.24 - 415.28] forever forever you know chemicals
[412.60 - 417.96] you'll see this whole thing out there
[415.28 - 419.84] about forever chemicals and you'll see
[417.96 - 423.12] article after article and people be
[419.84 - 423.12] talking about it but forever
[423.16 - 426.92] chemicals yeah it's not something
[424.84 - 429.88] medical medium information talked a lot
[426.92 - 431.88] about because that's compared
[429.88 - 433.40] to what's really in people's brains
[431.88 - 435.08] that's compared to what people
[433.40 - 436.52] are really up against and that's
[435.08 - 438.84]  compared to what's really going
[436.52 - 441.32] on like the reality and real problems
[438.84 - 443.76] okay so forever chemicals sure that's
[441.32 - 446.16] not a good thing but you'll see it's the
[443.76 - 449.12] buzz right now but it's a great
[446.16 - 451.88] distraction for what's really causing
[449.12 - 454.12] harm to people's neurological systems
[451.88 - 456.24] and their brain and their organs and
[454.12 - 458.60] everything else their other organs and
[456.24 - 463.08] that's the sad thing but there's always
[458.60 - 465.80] some kind of hip trendy BS thing going
[463.08 - 468.12] on and forever chemicals avoid these
[465.80 - 471.00] foods with forever chemicals avoid these
[468.12 - 472.44] foods that have this and that in it and
[471.00 - 474.24] that you know you'll hear that out there
[472.44 - 475.60] it's like okay great great glad you got
[474.24 - 479.12] that figured out you're not supposed to
[475.60 - 481.80] spray crap that's you know on pans and
[479.12 - 483.64] you know cook your food you know aerosol
[481.80 - 487.28] cans filled with all kinds of crazy
[483.64 - 490.08] stuff sure I get it duh but really it's
[487.28 - 493.24] much bigger than that it's a viral
[490.08 - 494.72] explosion I've always said it's Plastics
[493.24 - 496.60] right that's another thing that's been a
[494.72 - 498.68] problem out there I've always said it's
[496.60 - 500.52] radiation that's another thing out there
[498.68 - 503.28] so life-changing Foods I talked about
[500.52 - 506.20] the viral explosion and the metals and
[503.28 - 508.00] the radiation right the pesticides like
[506.20 - 509.84] DDT and everything that are still out
[508.00 - 513.32] there and they're still using DDT by the
[509.84 - 515.92] way they're still using it all around
[513.32 - 518.52] the globe that stuff is like still
[515.92 - 521.60] backlogged I mean they they have like
[518.52 - 524.52] warehouses and warehouses filled the DDT
[521.60 - 528.64] from the 1950s and the
[524.52 - 531.36] 1940s and the 1960s they have so much to
[528.64 - 534.92] use that they're still unloading it
[531.36 - 539.68] they're unloading barrels of DBT with
[534.92 - 541.44] dates on the barrels like 1951 1952 and
[539.68 - 543.12] they're unloading these and selling them
[541.44 - 544.60] to you know on the black market to
[543.12 - 546.80] people they're using it all around the
[544.60 - 549.20] world they're using it as a pesticide
[546.80 - 551.16] and insectic side they're using As for
[549.20 - 553.60] apartment buildings around the world
[551.16 - 555.52] they're using DDT still and that's how
[553.60 - 557.12] insane things are so it's like yeah
[555.52 - 559.68] forever
[557.12 - 561.84] chemicals yeah blah blah blah I hear
[559.68 - 563.60] that all the time now it's like you
[561.84 - 566.56] don't worry about those how about
[563.60 - 569.00] worrying about all the Mercury and the
[566.56 - 570.44] lead and the cadmium and the copper
[569.00 - 572.68] that's going into people's brains and
[570.44 - 574.12] building up like crazy right now how
[572.68 - 575.68] about worrying about other things how
[574.12 - 577.64] about worrying about everybody's zinc
[575.68 - 579.88] deficiency how about that there zinc
[577.64 - 582.24] deficiencies are just out totally
[579.88 - 584.72] outrageous on the level people have zinc
[582.24 - 586.92] deficiencies and then you know worry
[584.72 - 588.08] about the viral explosion that's taking
[586.92 - 590.92] off where people are getting
[588.08 - 595.84] neurologically sick because of viruses
[590.92 - 597.84] viral explosion and boom Metals right
[595.84 - 599.56] those are the two big ones and then of
[597.84 - 601.28] course there's all these solvents and
[599.56 - 603.64] all these pesticides and herbicides and
[601.28 - 605.80] fungicides which are high in metals and
[603.64 - 608.16] there's all these other different things
[605.80 - 609.84] that get in people's systems solvents
[608.16 - 612.56] are a big one right there that's an
[609.84 - 614.16] antagonist and then Pharmaceuticals
[612.56 - 616.68] right Pharmaceuticals in water
[614.16 - 619.40] Pharmaceuticals in food Pharmaceuticals
[616.68 - 621.64] in everything basically it's in the air
[619.40 - 623.92] it's in pole water if you go swimming
[621.64 - 625.60] it's in the beach Pharmaceuticals are
[623.92 - 628.20] floating everywhere now and that's
[625.60 - 630.28] another thing on its own but either way
[628.20 - 632.72] there's a lot of different different
[630.28 - 636.36] things that are getting into us and
[632.72 - 639.36] creating that dirty blood syndrome which
[636.36 - 641.48] creates a dirty liver which creates a
[639.36 - 645.12] you know a dirty brain which creates all
[641.48 - 648.20] of this and we end up in trouble so
[645.12 - 650.04] there's lots to talk about here um you
[648.20 - 652.12] know as far as the hip stuff that's out
[650.04 - 654.08] there which they're trying to shove down
[652.12 - 657.40] people's throats forever chemicals is
[654.08 - 660.28] one of them the other one is HPV they're
[657.40 - 663.16] trying to actually say basic basically
[660.28 - 665.00] with HPV they're trying to say well HPV
[663.16 - 667.28] that's a cancer-causing virus that
[665.00 - 669.68] creates cancer it's interesting because
[667.28 - 671.68] they're using medical Med information
[669.68 - 674.04] that I put out there about epine bar and
[671.68 - 676.12] so forth creating cancer and they're
[674.04 - 677.72] using that information but they don't
[676.12 - 680.44] have the science to back it up so this
[677.72 - 682.44] is pretty crazy so it's like oh HPV
[680.44 - 684.40] causes all kinds of throat cancer causes
[682.44 - 687.52] all kinds of cancers because it gets
[684.40 - 689.76] into it invades the tissue creating you
[687.52 - 692.12] know de demented C
[689.76 - 694.92] uh really because it's medical medium
[692.12 - 698.08] information that's all about viruses
[694.92 - 700.64] creating damaged cells which in turn
[698.08 - 702.76] creates cancerous cells I published
[700.64 - 705.04] articles about it I put it in the books
[702.76 - 706.68] I lectured about it before the books but
[705.04 - 708.36] now science all of a sudden what they
[706.68 - 710.16] just went to Medical medium again they
[708.36 - 712.28] just took well let's just pluck this out
[710.16 - 714.68] now this sounds great let's just start
[712.28 - 715.92] saying how HPV creates cancer it's like
[714.68 - 717.40] where's your science though when you
[715.92 - 719.00] really dig into it they don't have it
[717.40 - 721.60] they've never seen HPV even create a
[719.00 - 723.40] cancer can saw that's how sick that is
[721.60 - 725.12] but they take the information and
[723.40 - 726.64] they're now applying my Epstein bar
[725.12 - 728.60] information about Epstein bar and other
[726.64 - 730.56] viruses creating cancer cells and now
[728.60 - 732.76] they take that and they now take it put
[730.56 - 735.72] it to HPV even though they have no signs
[732.76 - 740.12] to show it it's actually disturbing but
[735.72 - 744.76] that's how it works out there so
[740.12 - 746.40] um but yes if you talk to people enough
[744.76 - 749.32] or you look into things or you're just
[746.40 - 751.28] looking for help somewhere some services
[749.32 - 752.96] or you You' got errands to run or you
[751.28 - 754.68] didn't you talk to somebody here or you
[752.96 - 756.12] talk to somebody there you'll notice
[754.68 - 761.32] that things aren't working like they
[756.12 - 763.92] used to preco era pre right four years
[761.32 - 765.48] ago pre five years ago you'll notice
[763.92 - 768.04] things aren't the same you'll notice
[765.48 - 770.52] people making mistakes like a ton of
[768.04 - 772.00] mistakes that's what people do they're
[770.52 - 773.52] making lots of mistakes because their
[772.00 - 775.44] brains aren't working good have you
[773.52 - 776.96] noticed it have you noticed it yet a
[775.44 - 778.28] whole bit their brains aren't working
[776.96 - 779.68] like they should some mistakes are
[778.28 - 782.44] happening all the time
[779.68 - 784.92] and people are not functioning like they
[782.44 - 786.84] should and that's happening right there
[784.92 - 789.20] yep Dr fa they take medical Med
[786.84 - 790.00] information warp it to fit their agenda
[789.20 - 792.88] very
[790.00 - 794.16] true very correct right there so I'm
[792.88 - 795.44] going to read just a couple of things
[794.16 - 797.24] first of all I'm talking about chronic
[795.44 - 800.00] illness as well you know chronic fatigue
[797.24 - 802.52] syndrome neurological fatigue that's a
[800.00 - 804.00] big one right there you know for years
[802.52 - 806.48] and years and years it was all about
[804.00 - 808.60] people being tired you know yeah you're
[806.48 - 810.40] tired you just you're depressed that's
[808.60 - 812.64] why you're tired tired you're depressed
[810.40 - 815.08] that's why you're tired it's like no I'm
[812.64 - 817.44] not depressed I don't want yeah I am
[815.08 - 819.36] depressed because I'm T I'm not
[817.44 - 821.88] depressed no I'm depressed now because
[819.36 - 824.04] I'm tired I can't function for 6 months
[821.88 - 826.68] but I wasn't depressed before I got
[824.04 - 829.20] tired but now I'm tired every day and I
[826.68 - 830.88] can't function so now I am depressed so
[829.20 - 832.48] the confusion is there that happens all
[830.88 - 834.08] the time to people it's like no you're
[832.48 - 835.88] depressed you need an anti-depressant
[834.08 - 838.32] need anti-anxiety meds and
[835.88 - 839.88] anti-depressants that's why you're tired
[838.32 - 841.72] but really what's happening is people
[839.88 - 844.12] have so many problems in their brain
[841.72 - 846.76] their brain stem problems in their brain
[844.12 - 848.96] stem problems with their cranial nerves
[846.76 - 850.88] they're inflamed they're inflamed
[848.96 - 854.68] because of metals and viruses those are
[850.88 - 857.08] the two big boys right there JS says yes
[854.68 - 860.28] I work in Bakery and it's a Biz it's
[857.08 - 862.84] bizarre how much brain fog there is not
[860.28 - 865.00] only that but there's also a lot of
[862.84 - 867.32] arrogance and entitlement coupled with
[865.00 - 870.56] it
[867.32 - 873.60] entitlement entitlement that's a fun one
[870.56 - 875.76] right there enti entitlement is
[873.60 - 878.16] definitely out there there's no question
[875.76 - 881.16] about that I've talked about entitlement
[878.16 - 883.16] a little bit you know there's in people
[881.16 - 884.80] who have gone after medical medium with
[883.16 - 888.08] lies and all kinds of other stuff they
[884.80 - 890.36] were highly entitled so many people are
[888.08 - 892.48] that entitlement thing is just crazy I
[890.36 - 894.80] know I know it's true though it's a
[892.48 - 896.80] level of like brain fog but it's a level
[894.80 - 898.44] of entitlement with it crispy
[896.80 - 900.84] perspective they repeat the wrong
[898.44 - 902.92] numbers can't remember things oh my God
[900.84 - 906.88] it pre
[902.92 - 908.76] 2019 pre-2020 it wasn't like that they
[906.88 - 911.16] repeat the wrong numbers can't remember
[908.76 - 913.64] things can't read info correctly can't
[911.16 - 915.04] spell get brain fog Etc crispy
[913.64 - 916.20] perspective that's exactly what's
[915.04 - 918.00] happening out there sure there was
[916.20 - 919.60] always a little bit about that little
[918.00 - 923.04] bit of that out there okay keep that in
[919.60 - 927.88] mind there's always a little bit of that
[923.04 - 929.88] out there pre 2019 pre-2020 there was
[927.88 - 933.00] there just was there brain fog out there
[929.88 - 936.00] of course I mean there's sick brains
[933.00 - 939.84] there's people that aren't well but it
[936.00 - 942.92] exploded exploded Parkinson boom on the
[939.84 - 945.24] rise right Ms On The Rise Parkinson's On
[942.92 - 948.00] The Rise all the different you know
[945.24 - 950.92] memory loss Alzheimer's dementia all on
[948.00 - 952.12] the rise but it's even more than that
[950.92 - 954.60] it's like this person doesn't have
[952.12 - 956.20] Alzheimer's but this person just got the
[954.60 - 958.00] numbers wrong right there and then they
[956.20 - 959.44] put it in the computer and boom they
[958.00 - 961.20] just ruined your life and now you're
[959.44 - 963.20] calling that you know blah blah blah hey
[961.20 - 965.00] that's not that's not what happened
[963.20 - 966.80] identity theft or this and it whatever
[965.00 - 968.28] it is you know the craziest stuff's
[966.80 - 970.40] happening because people are misplacing
[968.28 - 972.32] numbers and information that you're you
[970.40 - 974.28] know you need services for whatever
[972.32 - 975.92] you're doing and they're you're using
[974.28 - 977.36] private information and you're giving it
[975.92 - 979.48] to them and they just put it in the
[977.36 - 981.56] wrong category or the wrong place and
[979.48 - 985.24] then it gets out there it's crazy what's
[981.56 - 987.44] happening um it really is Katie over
[985.24 - 989.64] here on YouTube Says Yes actually now
[987.44 - 992.80] that he says that people do do seem to
[989.64 - 994.80] make a lot of mistakes oh like it's
[992.80 - 997.56] unbelievable to the degree like things
[994.80 - 999.12] don't go smoothly anywhere sometimes I
[997.56 - 1001.60] wonder how the world is still
[999.12 - 1003.32] functioning seriously Katie that is
[1001.60 - 1005.80] exactly what's happening now it is
[1003.32 - 1008.24] getting worse it was worse it was bad a
[1005.80 - 1011.88] year ago it was bad two years ago now
[1008.24 - 1013.96] it's absurdly insanely bad like it is so
[1011.88 - 1016.60] bad now but what are we going to do
[1013.96 - 1019.00] about it probably nothing it's just
[1016.60 - 1020.40] getting worse and worse and worse but I
[1019.00 - 1024.20] want you to be able to protect yourself
[1020.40 - 1026.08] so you're not falling into that category
[1024.20 - 1027.60] of people where mistakes are being made
[1026.08 - 1031.20] and everything else is happening like
[1027.60 - 1033.48] that so yeah so you you live a good life
[1031.20 - 1035.48] and you can think clear and you can
[1033.48 - 1037.32] function and you can you know you can
[1035.48 - 1039.32] see other people messing up left and
[1037.32 - 1041.56] right because their brain isn't working
[1039.32 - 1043.92] but at Le at least yours is working and
[1041.56 - 1046.16] you see it I'd rather have you on that
[1043.92 - 1048.48] end I want to be on that end I want to
[1046.16 - 1051.56] be on the end of like my brain's working
[1048.48 - 1053.84] yeah and that is good end to be on and
[1051.56 - 1055.48] then I want to be there and then I want
[1053.84 - 1057.72] to be on the end where you know I'm
[1055.48 - 1059.40] seeing everybody mess up it sucks I
[1057.72 - 1061.96] don't want to see people mess up but I'd
[1059.40 - 1063.56] rather be where I am now like you guys
[1061.96 - 1064.64] and then see other people just screwing
[1063.56 - 1066.40] up every second because their brain
[1064.64 - 1068.96] isn't working I don't want to be
[1066.40 - 1070.88] somebody who's losing their mind and
[1068.96 - 1072.24] that's what's happening out there um
[1070.88 - 1075.04] because it's
[1072.24 - 1078.48] true the medical medum heavy metal detox
[1075.04 - 1081.48] is critical to protect people it just is
[1078.48 - 1083.84] that's a fact it just is it's critical
[1081.48 - 1085.64] to help people and protect them it's in
[1083.84 - 1088.92] the it's in the medical medium brains
[1085.64 - 1091.40] saer books right here okay it's in there
[1088.92 - 1093.00] and you know it's important to take care
[1091.40 - 1094.36] of your brain so let's talk about Foods
[1093.00 - 1097.24] a little bit before we get into some
[1094.36 - 1100.32] illnesses let's do that okay
[1097.24 - 1102.56] so what you see in front of me is just
[1100.32 - 1104.12] some foods okay you got a cheeseburger
[1102.56 - 1106.00] right here you got a pizza right there
[1104.12 - 1107.84] you got I think a meatball wedge
[1106.00 - 1110.48] meatball wedge you got a steak and
[1107.84 - 1112.32] cheese right there steak and cheese got
[1110.48 - 1115.28] some eggs over here if you see that got
[1112.32 - 1118.44] a nice big hero right here a big hogy
[1115.28 - 1119.84] big wedge grinder whatever you call it
[1118.44 - 1121.56] whatever you want to call it or whatever
[1119.84 - 1123.56] it's called somewhere right so you got
[1121.56 - 1125.40] that there too but what you're seeing in
[1123.56 - 1127.68] here sure our foods that you might not
[1125.40 - 1130.04] eat you might not be out there eating
[1127.68 - 1132.40] these Foods tomorrow you might not be
[1130.04 - 1135.36] eating maybe you never even you you like
[1132.40 - 1138.84] the hero right there and so you may not
[1135.36 - 1141.52] be eating these okay but there's things
[1138.84 - 1143.72] in these foods that you may be eating
[1141.52 - 1145.12] though in some other food keep that in
[1143.72 - 1148.44] mind you might be like I haven't had a
[1145.12 - 1151.32] meatball wedge in 20 years so this
[1148.44 - 1154.88] excludes me aw oh it's not really about
[1151.32 - 1157.68] the meatball wedge it's about the egg in
[1154.88 - 1160.08] the meatball it's about the cheese on
[1157.68 - 1162.28] the meatball wedge it's about these
[1160.08 - 1165.92] things right it's about the
[1162.28 - 1167.92] oil that was used in that meatball wedge
[1165.92 - 1170.00] it's about the gluten in the bread
[1167.92 - 1171.80] crumbs that were were used in the
[1170.00 - 1173.28] meatballs cuz you know a lot of people
[1171.80 - 1176.44] do meatballs they put there's
[1173.28 - 1178.52] breadcrumbs put into the meatballs right
[1176.44 - 1181.24] and there's eggs put into the meatballs
[1178.52 - 1183.72] and so forth but there's eggs and gluten
[1181.24 - 1186.32] and then there's Dairy and it's these
[1183.72 - 1188.68] Foods right here that are problematic
[1186.32 - 1193.96] for so many reasons one big reason is
[1188.68 - 1198.84] those Foods feed feed bugs bugs that eat
[1193.96 - 1201.04] people alive over time so bugs love
[1198.84 - 1204.36] things like Dairy and they love the
[1201.04 - 1206.72] proteins and eggs and they love the
[1204.36 - 1210.60] gluten they love the feed off of gluten
[1206.72 - 1214.48] bugs love these kinds of foods and so
[1210.60 - 1216.24] it's key to actually know hey look these
[1214.48 - 1218.68] aren't good foods and it's not good to
[1216.24 - 1220.40] get canola oil in your system do you
[1218.68 - 1223.64] know I started talking about canola oil
[1220.40 - 1227.64] being bad for people in the 80s how
[1223.64 - 1231.88] crazy is that in the80s canola oil is
[1227.64 - 1235.20] bad everybody thought I was crazy to say
[1231.88 - 1238.20] canola oil is bad it was like what are
[1235.20 - 1239.28] you talking about canola oil and then
[1238.20 - 1241.92] now you need got to worry about the
[1239.28 - 1244.20] canola oil and olive oil mixes out there
[1241.92 - 1247.24] that's a big deal is the mix of canola
[1244.20 - 1250.04] oil and olive oil it's everywhere so
[1247.24 - 1253.68] what we're allowed to do here is we're
[1250.04 - 1256.16] allowed to take uh olive oil mix it with
[1253.68 - 1259.28] a little bit of canola oil and call it
[1256.16 - 1262.12] just olive oil that's how it works here
[1259.28 - 1265.20] now so that's the rules and that's a
[1262.12 - 1267.84] scary place to be and but it's the rules
[1265.20 - 1270.92] now as long as the percentage of canola
[1267.84 - 1272.80] oil is less than the olive oil maybe
[1270.92 - 1275.40] even a lot less than the olive oil and
[1272.80 - 1277.28] you make a mix right there predominantly
[1275.40 - 1279.76] as long as you know you got the olive
[1277.28 - 1282.36] oil there and the majority is the olive
[1279.76 - 1285.28] oil you can call it olive oil not Olive
[1282.36 - 1288.92] and canola you don't have to put canola
[1285.28 - 1291.36] on the ingredient list on the bottle
[1288.92 - 1294.64] canola oil is
[1291.36 - 1297.72] damaging damaging to the intestinal
[1294.64 - 1300.12] tract to the liver it's not a good oil
[1297.72 - 1301.60] to have people eat that all the time and
[1300.12 - 1304.72] don't even know it's in all these salad
[1301.60 - 1307.52] dressings it's in lots of condiments
[1304.72 - 1309.04] canola oil is infiltrated in all of
[1307.52 - 1311.52] these condiments out there you got to
[1309.04 - 1315.08] worry about it something to keep in mind
[1311.52 - 1317.64] right these things matter these little
[1315.08 - 1320.28] things matter I know people want to live
[1317.64 - 1322.56] their lives they want to be in Bliss
[1320.28 - 1325.12] they don't want any rules they don't
[1322.56 - 1326.84] want any concerns they don't want to get
[1325.12 - 1329.08] depressed about food or about what
[1326.84 - 1330.76] they're eating they don't want to be sad
[1329.08 - 1333.52] or anything like that and feel like
[1330.76 - 1335.48] they're being restrictive I get it I get
[1333.52 - 1337.68] it but if you're sick you got to do
[1335.48 - 1339.24] something about it bottom line before
[1337.68 - 1341.80] the medical medium books the health
[1339.24 - 1344.56] movement thought canola oil was good
[1341.80 - 1347.88] even though aw was out there screaming
[1344.56 - 1350.92] how bad it was the health movement
[1347.88 - 1353.84] thought canol oil was not just good but
[1350.92 - 1356.76] freaking great the health movement
[1353.84 - 1358.60] believed it was great not just great
[1356.76 - 1360.80] excellent for you that's what the health
[1358.60 - 1363.36] movement believed before medical medium
[1360.80 - 1365.20] books medical medium books got out there
[1363.36 - 1367.80] put the information out there even
[1365.20 - 1370.00] stronger and much more aggressive in
[1367.80 - 1374.04] this sense where it got around the world
[1370.00 - 1375.88] because thank God I got a publisher to
[1374.04 - 1377.64] to stand behind medical medium
[1375.88 - 1379.92] information and to stand behind the
[1377.64 - 1382.48] medical medium book books an amazing
[1379.92 - 1385.08] publisher at that Hay House I don't know
[1382.48 - 1387.60] if you guys know about Hay House
[1385.08 - 1391.04] phenomenal best publisher I believe at
[1387.60 - 1393.88] the world hands down and they backed the
[1391.04 - 1396.36] medical medium they took the they took
[1393.88 - 1397.76] the medical media manuscripts and they
[1396.36 - 1400.68] put it out there
[1397.76 - 1403.40] worldwide millions of man millions of
[1400.68 - 1406.04] copies of the books got out there in
[1403.40 - 1408.04] people's hands thanks to the publisher
[1406.04 - 1409.00] changed the world of Health all the way
[1408.04 - 1413.40] around
[1409.00 - 1415.84] that's these babies right here okay and
[1413.40 - 1420.48] people then the health movement shifted
[1415.84 - 1422.60] and canola oil was now bad so in the
[1420.48 - 1424.88] health movement canola oil became a bad
[1422.60 - 1426.32] thing all right I want to read a couple
[1424.88 - 1427.96] cool things I want to read this little
[1426.32 - 1432.16] section right here page
[1427.96 - 1435.16] 93 uh brain saver right there it's
[1432.16 - 1437.84] called toxin clouded emotions
[1435.16 - 1440.28] interesting right so's information
[1437.84 - 1442.04] everyday toxins and poisons inside the
[1440.28 - 1445.48] brain are a large part of the brain
[1442.04 - 1448.08] limitations we experience brain
[1445.48 - 1449.24] limitations from toxins and poisons in
[1448.08 - 1452.00] the brain did you know the health
[1449.24 - 1453.72] movement didn't really even like I mean
[1452.00 - 1455.96] the conventional Health movement didn't
[1453.72 - 1458.04] even use the word toxin it was
[1455.96 - 1460.36] ridiculous most of the health movement
[1458.04 - 1463.28] didn't even touch the word toxin it was
[1460.36 - 1465.24] crazy everyday toxins and poisons inside
[1463.28 - 1466.96] the brain are a large part of the brain
[1465.24 - 1469.56] limitations we experience including
[1466.96 - 1471.64] emotional limitations so emotional
[1469.56 - 1473.44] limitations so someone could be seeing
[1471.64 - 1475.48] their psychiatrist they can be seeing
[1473.44 - 1478.16] their therapists they could be seeing
[1475.48 - 1483.00] their coaches and they're just they're
[1478.16 - 1485.52] just like unloading so much so much just
[1483.00 - 1488.08] suffering and pain and confusion and
[1485.52 - 1490.44] depression and anxiety issues and
[1488.08 - 1493.08] everything else are unloading unloading
[1490.44 - 1495.00] unloading but really what's happening is
[1493.08 - 1498.60] there's limitations emotionally because
[1495.00 - 1500.08] the brain is so overburdened with junk
[1498.60 - 1502.04] and garbage in there and lotss of
[1500.08 - 1503.76] different you know things in there if an
[1502.04 - 1505.68] area of the brain is clouded with an
[1503.76 - 1507.28] abundant level of poisons and toxins
[1505.68 - 1509.04] ranging from toxic heavy metals to
[1507.28 - 1511.36] solvents to Plastics and other
[1509.04 - 1513.40] petrochemicals to Pharmaceuticals to air
[1511.36 - 1516.32] fresheners fragrances scented candles
[1513.40 - 1517.88] and Beyond CTIC candles you everybody's
[1516.32 - 1519.44] freaking out about vaping out there
[1517.88 - 1521.84] they're freaking out all the time now
[1519.44 - 1524.48] you see horror stories about vaping
[1521.84 - 1526.72] people know vaping is just terrifying
[1524.48 - 1529.00] it's so bad for so many people people
[1526.72 - 1532.60] know this out there you know
[1529.00 - 1534.60] they know it's gotten bad The Vaping
[1532.60 - 1536.32] thing destroys your lungs causes
[1534.60 - 1539.32] problems people get injured by it and
[1536.32 - 1542.64] everything else scented candles are
[1539.32 - 1545.40] vaping that's a level of vaping it's
[1542.64 - 1547.16] scented candles I remember when I first
[1545.40 - 1548.72] started hitting the whole fragrances
[1547.16 - 1550.16] really hard and the scented candles
[1548.72 - 1552.80] everybody was just screaming at me like
[1550.16 - 1554.68] all you care about is scented candles
[1552.80 - 1557.32] and fragrances what's wrong with you
[1554.68 - 1558.96] medical medium putting fear at us about
[1557.32 - 1561.52] scented candles
[1558.96 - 1563.04] yeah it's that bad scent to candles are
[1561.52 - 1564.76] that bad and then people are taking it
[1563.04 - 1567.00] now right taking that information you'll
[1564.76 - 1568.56] see somebody pop up on Tik Tok like Tik
[1567.00 - 1573.28] Tok like fragrances the sending candles
[1568.56 - 1576.20] are bad mhm yeah sure yep they
[1573.28 - 1578.28] are so people have all that stuff the
[1576.20 - 1580.20] area of the brain that gets clouded up
[1578.28 - 1583.24] with these brain betrayers like sended
[1580.20 - 1585.84] candles and air fresheners clones and
[1583.24 - 1588.32] perfumes and metals which sit inside of
[1585.84 - 1590.44] all those things I just said the bra
[1588.32 - 1592.36] brain the emotional Center of that of
[1590.44 - 1594.04] your brain gets actually all kind of
[1592.36 - 1596.72] clogged up with that we're going to have
[1594.04 - 1598.32] a trouble and we're going to be in big
[1596.72 - 1600.28] trouble when emotional centers of the
[1598.32 - 1602.04] brain become filled up and clouded with
[1600.28 - 1604.52] toxins and poisons we become more
[1602.04 - 1607.00] reliant on other parts of our brain so
[1604.52 - 1609.00] it's another thing that happens so as
[1607.00 - 1611.36] the emotional you ever run into somebody
[1609.00 - 1614.44] that's just like so numb emotionally
[1611.36 - 1617.32] though they're emotional in some ways
[1614.44 - 1619.40] but they're so numb they're just numb
[1617.32 - 1621.52] with seeing like somebody else's
[1619.40 - 1623.80] emotions are what they're going through
[1621.52 - 1626.24] they're just numb in general they seem
[1623.80 - 1627.68] like they're really really self-absorbed
[1626.24 - 1630.08] and they're wallowing in their own
[1627.68 - 1631.72] suffering and pain and everything but
[1630.08 - 1633.72] really they're just like they're numbed
[1631.72 - 1636.36] out and numb that means the emotional
[1633.72 - 1638.20] centers of the brain got so clogged up
[1636.36 - 1640.40] and so clouded up with toxins and
[1638.20 - 1642.36] poisons to such a degree that they're
[1640.40 - 1643.72] now using other parts of their brain
[1642.36 - 1645.44] they're using other parts of the brain
[1643.72 - 1647.68] which means that they just they're not
[1645.44 - 1649.76] connecting at all to that person in any
[1647.68 - 1651.84] way it's not possible instead they're
[1649.76 - 1654.76] just you know off here
[1651.84 - 1656.16] instead so um we'll go into a little bit
[1654.76 - 1658.96] more of this
[1656.16 - 1660.88] right we can become Limited in getting
[1658.96 - 1661.84] in touch with our own emotional state
[1660.88 - 1663.48] and that's another thing
[1661.84 - 1665.16] depersonalization so let's go into
[1663.48 - 1667.68] depersonalization a little bit I mean
[1665.16 - 1669.76] you guys know anybody who suffered with
[1667.68 - 1670.44] depersonalization or maybe are suffering
[1669.76 - 1672.36] with
[1670.44 - 1674.36] depersonalization that's a big one out
[1672.36 - 1677.16] there that's getting worse too every
[1674.36 - 1679.52] single condition that I can say is like
[1677.16 - 1681.40] this now up there versus down here
[1679.52 - 1683.04] depersonalization boom that's how many
[1681.40 - 1686.56] more people are actually suffering with
[1683.04 - 1688.88] that it's incredible what's happening so
[1686.56 - 1690.60] the personalization is a big one so when
[1688.88 - 1692.68] the emotional centers of the brain are
[1690.60 - 1695.36] getting clouded up with poisons and
[1692.68 - 1697.68] toxins and metals and all of that then
[1695.36 - 1699.36] we get disconnected toxins and poisons
[1697.68 - 1701.56] clogging the emotional centers of brain
[1699.36 - 1703.60] can also mean that we become extremely
[1701.56 - 1706.16] emotional without understanding why so
[1703.60 - 1708.44] then we're having a burst or an episode
[1706.16 - 1710.64] or we get triggered easy how many people
[1708.44 - 1712.60] you know get triggered easy because the
[1710.64 - 1715.32] emotional centers of the brain are so
[1712.60 - 1717.20] poisoned up they're so clogged up with
[1715.32 - 1720.28] so much different stuff right how many
[1717.20 - 1722.48] people you know get triggered so easily
[1720.28 - 1724.68] emotionally and it's like boom they're
[1722.48 - 1727.40] in an episode they're triggered boom and
[1724.68 - 1729.88] they're there like easily there how many
[1727.40 - 1731.80] people do you know so many people go
[1729.88 - 1734.20] through that because there's that much
[1731.80 - 1737.08] junk and garbage inside the emotional
[1734.20 - 1740.04] centers of the brain causing somebody to
[1737.08 - 1742.20] be like this is Lightning Fast triggered
[1740.04 - 1744.08] in the moment an episode can hit out of
[1742.20 - 1746.20] nowhere or they're just completely
[1744.08 - 1748.12] numbed out disconnected with
[1746.20 - 1751.52] depersonalization but even people with
[1748.12 - 1753.68] depersonalization you guys end up boom
[1751.52 - 1756.12] into sometimes like the deep end with a
[1753.68 - 1757.40] trigger then now they're just oh
[1756.12 - 1759.04] everything's just coming out
[1757.40 - 1760.68] everything's just rolling out right you
[1759.04 - 1762.08] guys it's just unbelievable what's
[1760.68 - 1763.64] happening there's people out there like
[1762.08 - 1764.84] that where they're numb they're numb
[1763.64 - 1767.16] they're numb they're numb and then all
[1764.84 - 1769.16] of a sudden they're off the deep end and
[1767.16 - 1771.28] everything is just dumping out and
[1769.16 - 1772.96] they're just in such a place they're in
[1771.28 - 1775.48] such a place with it all so that's
[1772.96 - 1778.08] something to to think about right there
[1775.48 - 1781.64] too on IG right there okay every day
[1778.08 - 1785.24] okay so let's see loving healing says
[1781.64 - 1786.20] I'm a medical doctor I'm me sure a
[1785.24 - 1789.48] medical
[1786.20 - 1791.88] coder read notes every day and most
[1789.48 - 1794.24] people have memory issues mental health
[1791.88 - 1796.68] problems Barkin in it's terrible yeah
[1794.24 - 1798.80] most people do and it's getting worse
[1796.68 - 1801.88] and worse and worse
[1798.80 - 1803.88] oh my God it's just it's sad what's
[1801.88 - 1807.80] happening out there um thank you for
[1803.88 - 1809.80] that comment by the way all right formed
[1807.80 - 1812.68] by Nature over there in IG says why did
[1809.80 - 1814.92] they release the tickets a day early the
[1812.68 - 1818.48] email said tomorrow to register what
[1814.92 - 1820.76] happened okay here's what happened okay
[1818.48 - 1823.08] we were all set to launch the Cafe
[1820.76 - 1825.36] Gratitude medical medium collaboration
[1823.08 - 1828.00] tomorrow we were all set to launch it
[1825.36 - 1829.56] tomorrow had my whole team working on it
[1828.00 - 1831.52] they were killing themselves I kid you
[1829.56 - 1834.52] not like like working hard on it right
[1831.52 - 1836.80] they have been all week and so forth and
[1834.52 - 1839.04] then what happened was we were all set
[1836.80 - 1840.88] to do it for tomorrow and we were
[1839.04 - 1842.96] mentioning CA gratitude collaboration
[1840.88 - 1845.76] and all of it I mean you know a big part
[1842.96 - 1849.32] of my team was doing it and then out of
[1845.76 - 1852.16] nowhere someone somehow got a hold of
[1849.32 - 1854.96] the link that was supposed to be put in
[1852.16 - 1857.36] the email and released tomorrow they got
[1854.96 - 1859.40] a hold of it today and then they passed
[1857.36 - 1861.40] it around in all the groups and
[1859.40 - 1863.76] everywhere and then things just went
[1861.40 - 1865.72] haywire and it went crazy I mean it's
[1863.76 - 1867.76] mindblowing really how it happened and
[1865.72 - 1869.48] what happened but it's also going to
[1867.76 - 1871.16] upset some people let's just be honest
[1869.48 - 1872.64] there it's going to upset a few people
[1871.16 - 1874.00] that were waiting for tomorrow looking
[1872.64 - 1875.32] out for tomorrow like I said before
[1874.00 - 1877.12] there are people sleeping on the other
[1875.32 - 1880.28] side of the world right now asleep and
[1877.12 - 1883.44] they're going to wake up tomorrow and
[1880.28 - 1886.80] they're going to be like what happened
[1883.44 - 1889.44] what happened and so the link basically
[1886.80 - 1892.72] got out someone somehow sleuthed it and
[1889.44 - 1895.76] they found it or they found it somewhere
[1892.72 - 1898.04] yeah it's it's something like
[1895.76 - 1899.52] that making peace with our healing
[1898.04 - 1901.24] timeline I want to talk about healing
[1899.52 - 1902.88] timelines right here too a little bit
[1901.24 - 1906.24] because neurological problems and brain
[1902.88 - 1909.60] problems don't go away fast for a lot of
[1906.24 - 1912.68] people they don't Parkinson's does not
[1909.60 - 1914.56] go away in a day for people people who
[1912.68 - 1917.04] do medical M information can get rid of
[1914.56 - 1918.64] their Parkinson how many people reverse
[1917.04 - 1923.28] their Parkinson with medical medum
[1918.64 - 1925.20] information a lot of people okay so um
[1923.28 - 1927.16] but does it happen in a day no it
[1925.20 - 1928.76] doesn't you can see results in a day
[1927.16 - 1931.56] believe it or not just by bringing in
[1928.76 - 1935.60] some of the tools but getting rid of it
[1931.56 - 1937.80] completely in a day will never
[1935.60 - 1940.24] happen
[1937.80 - 1942.60] so conditions like
[1940.24 - 1943.92] Parkinson's or any kind of neurological
[1942.60 - 1946.08] condition and that's another problem too
[1943.92 - 1948.96] on all on its own you may not be
[1946.08 - 1953.12] diagnosed with Parkinson's
[1948.96 - 1955.96] you may not be diagnosed as um dementia
[1953.12 - 1958.48] Alzheimer's you may not be di diagnosed
[1955.96 - 1960.48] to something like that but you got all
[1958.48 - 1962.20] these other different symptoms and you
[1960.48 - 1963.52] didn't even know they're neurological
[1962.20 - 1965.44] people out there have so many
[1963.52 - 1968.52] neurological symptoms like aches and
[1965.44 - 1970.92] pains tingles and numbness dizziness and
[1968.52 - 1973.36] vertigo and floaters in the eyes
[1970.92 - 1975.84] neurological migraines
[1973.36 - 1978.52] neurological gum pain that's
[1975.84 - 1981.64] unexplainable jaw pain unex explainable
[1978.52 - 1983.20] neological PL this in the chest okay a
[1981.64 - 1985.56] funny feeling of butterflies all the
[1983.20 - 1989.44] time in the stomach anxiety depression
[1985.56 - 1991.36] bipolar depersonalization OCD tourettes
[1989.44 - 1993.40] neurological so many people have
[1991.36 - 1997.76] different forms and versions of all of
[1993.40 - 2001.12] this ADHD add and they have all of this
[1997.76 - 2005.44] neurological stuff fatigue debilitating
[2001.12 - 2009.24] fatigue okay weak arms weak limbs weak
[2005.44 - 2011.76] fingers numb fingers numb toes
[2009.24 - 2015.72] restless leg syndrome insomnia all
[2011.76 - 2018.40] neurological the list goes on and on and
[2015.72 - 2020.84] on so I want to talk about U making
[2018.40 - 2023.92] peace with our healing timeline I want
[2020.84 - 2026.52] people to know you can heal and you will
[2023.92 - 2028.60] heal you got to stay on track okay doing
[2026.52 - 2033.04] the best you can and you can move
[2028.60 - 2035.64] forward and adopt these tools bring them
[2033.04 - 2037.84] into your life get them into your
[2035.64 - 2040.20] Consciousness use your free will to
[2037.84 - 2041.64] apply them and heal and move forward and
[2040.20 - 2044.12] heal so I want to talk about making
[2041.64 - 2046.76] peace with our healing timeline a little
[2044.12 - 2048.72] bit when we get sick we start to track
[2046.76 - 2051.88] the timeline did you ever run into
[2048.72 - 2054.08] anybody who tracks the timeline did you
[2051.88 - 2055.96] track the timeline I talked about this
[2054.08 - 2057.52] before but it's really important it's
[2055.96 - 2059.44] pertinent right now to talk about for a
[2057.52 - 2061.24] lot of reasons because that many more
[2059.44 - 2064.00] people are getting sick every day when
[2061.24 - 2066.72] we get sick we start to track the
[2064.00 - 2069.40] timeline everybody okay we count the
[2066.72 - 2071.88] days we've been sick maybe even the
[2069.40 - 2073.80] hours a lot of people will count hours
[2071.88 - 2075.84] believe it or not we count the weeks the
[2073.80 - 2077.64] months and eventually if it lasts that
[2075.84 - 2080.04] long and we're sick that long we count
[2077.64 - 2083.44] the years that's something we do when
[2080.04 - 2086.16] we're sick that is definitely something
[2083.44 - 2088.52] people do when they're sick it's like
[2086.16 - 2091.40] instantly it's like I got sick on this
[2088.52 - 2093.40] date I got sick that week I got sick
[2091.40 - 2095.00] that month and I've been sick for 5
[2093.40 - 2098.00] years people do
[2095.00 - 2100.04] it okayy
[2098.00 - 2102.24] over there on YouTube aw what tea are
[2100.04 - 2104.48] you drinking I'm drinking a lemon bomb
[2102.24 - 2107.96] tea right here but it's not just a lemon
[2104.48 - 2111.04] bomb tea it also has a shot of a couple
[2107.96 - 2114.12] of things in there it's got a shot of
[2111.04 - 2117.60] guess what it's got a shot shot of the
[2114.12 - 2119.80] vigy propolis I put in my lemon bomm tea
[2117.60 - 2124.76] as you can see right there it's The Vig
[2119.80 - 2127.40] propolis one of the most profound
[2124.76 - 2130.20] profound I mean right there is that prop
[2127.40 - 2132.68] is cure it's incredible anyway you guys
[2130.20 - 2135.28] know you guys know that it fully endorse
[2132.68 - 2137.80] mgy but anyway I have that in there but
[2135.28 - 2139.64] this is my lemon balm tea with propolis
[2137.80 - 2143.24] in
[2139.64 - 2145.72] there I love the way that tastes by the
[2143.24 - 2147.88] way something happens to us emotionally
[2145.72 - 2150.28] when remember when we remember the month
[2147.88 - 2153.48] we got sick the time of
[2150.28 - 2155.88] year something that connects with that
[2153.48 - 2159.68] and it sticks with us so if you were
[2155.88 - 2161.36] sick a year ago in September it sticks
[2159.68 - 2164.00] with you and then When September Comes
[2161.36 - 2166.00] Around again it's like boom right
[2164.00 - 2168.36] there's this connection that happens
[2166.00 - 2170.44] okay the beautiful thing about ever all
[2168.36 - 2172.44] of this is when you start healing you
[2170.44 - 2174.04] remember when you started to heal and
[2172.44 - 2177.28] you remember the month you started to
[2174.04 - 2182.08] heal and you start remembering and then
[2177.28 - 2184.40] that starts to wash over so many
[2182.08 - 2186.92] emotions so many different references
[2184.40 - 2189.20] and memories of when you got sick right
[2186.92 - 2191.52] it starts to take over that healing
[2189.20 - 2194.96] process starts to just be this bright
[2191.52 - 2197.36] light it's such a beautiful thing many
[2194.96 - 2199.80] of us remember the people we were around
[2197.36 - 2202.24] when we first got
[2199.80 - 2203.56] sick that's a big one right there some
[2202.24 - 2206.28] of you like well I was with my
[2203.56 - 2208.80] ex-boyfriend I was with my ex-girlfriend
[2206.28 - 2211.72] I was with my ex-wife I was with my
[2208.80 - 2214.24] husband I was with my friend I was on a
[2211.72 - 2216.44] trip I was on a vacation I went and took
[2214.24 - 2219.08] a trip to India I took a trip to you
[2216.44 - 2221.56] know the UK whatever it is people
[2219.08 - 2223.48] remember many of us remember the people
[2221.56 - 2225.84] we were around when we first got sick
[2223.48 - 2227.88] the places we were the jobs we were
[2225.84 - 2229.36] doing the commitments do you remember
[2227.88 - 2231.32] the job you were doing when you got sick
[2229.36 - 2234.16] do you remember if there was a job you
[2231.32 - 2235.92] had when you got sick that happens all
[2234.16 - 2237.48] the time too especially when people lose
[2235.92 - 2240.60] their jobs and lose their careers when
[2237.48 - 2243.56] they get sick they remember that the
[2240.60 - 2245.56] commitments we had on our plate time
[2243.56 - 2247.88] plays a large role in our emotional
[2245.56 - 2251.36] brain it's as if our emot emotional
[2247.88 - 2253.72] brain is directly connected to time sure
[2251.36 - 2257.04] we worry about time on a daily basis
[2253.72 - 2259.36] even when we're not sick or struggling
[2257.04 - 2261.56] our responsibilities and plans are based
[2259.36 - 2263.64] around time everything's based around
[2261.56 - 2265.52] time yet something changes when we're
[2263.64 - 2268.32] sick we see time differently we start
[2265.52 - 2270.84] saying it's time to get better you get
[2268.32 - 2272.84] sick it's time to get better and you can
[2270.84 - 2275.04] get better I want to tell you that right
[2272.84 - 2277.96] now this is really important to know you
[2275.04 - 2280.36] can get better remember that hold on to
[2277.96 - 2284.00] that keep that in your heart and keep
[2280.36 - 2286.16] that in your soul you can get better
[2284.00 - 2288.44] don't forget that that's Inc so
[2286.16 - 2289.56] important right I want to just go
[2288.44 - 2291.12] through this a little bit and I want to
[2289.56 - 2293.76] talk about shock therapies and in some
[2291.12 - 2293.76] other incredible
[2297.24 - 2301.96] tools something changes when we get sick
[2300.00 - 2304.32] we see time differently we start saying
[2301.96 - 2307.04] it's time to get better or it's about
[2304.32 - 2309.56] time I'm feeling better or we hear it's
[2307.04 - 2313.08] due time time you'll get better it's due
[2309.56 - 2316.24] time I get better it's about time I get
[2313.08 - 2318.00] better it's time right now to get better
[2316.24 - 2320.32] keep that in mind time is such a large
[2318.00 - 2323.60] aspect of illness because if we're sick
[2320.32 - 2326.60] we feel like we lost time we're losing
[2323.60 - 2327.88] out okay so if you guys know if you've
[2326.60 - 2329.32] been sick and I know a lot of you have
[2327.88 - 2331.44] been sick and struggling you've risen
[2329.32 - 2335.16] out of the ashes you
[2331.44 - 2338.04] know you know that it feels like it's
[2335.16 - 2339.84] lost time when you're sick so many
[2338.04 - 2342.64] things you could have done so many
[2339.84 - 2343.92] places you could have gone right and so
[2342.64 - 2346.60] many people have healed and they have
[2343.92 - 2348.56] gone to the medical medium events right
[2346.60 - 2351.20] they've done that recently there's
[2348.56 - 2352.88] people there that were sick for years
[2351.20 - 2354.40] couldn't travel couldn't do anything and
[2352.88 - 2356.80] now all of a sudden you're traveling and
[2354.40 - 2358.32] they were there which is mindblowing all
[2356.80 - 2362.08] on its
[2358.32 - 2364.28] own right time feels like it passes by
[2362.08 - 2366.52] us at the start it doesn't feel us
[2364.28 - 2368.20] threatening emotionally yeah I've been
[2366.52 - 2370.16] sick for a week I've been sick for 2
[2368.20 - 2372.24] weeks the hands of time start to feel
[2370.16 - 2375.20] heavy when it goes on too long you're
[2372.24 - 2377.84] not quite better you're not you're even
[2375.20 - 2379.68] getting worse and now time becomes
[2377.84 - 2382.00] doctor appointments and your care
[2379.68 - 2384.32] schedule time is about how much energy
[2382.00 - 2386.52] you have how much space you have around
[2384.32 - 2388.60] your illness to do what you need to do
[2386.52 - 2390.24] life can change when you're sick causing
[2388.60 - 2392.76] restrictions making us feel everything
[2390.24 - 2395.80] is so difficult we have to slow
[2392.76 - 2398.56] down and when you heal and when you
[2395.80 - 2400.76] start healing
[2398.56 - 2404.32] everything just speeds
[2400.76 - 2406.68] up everything just moves forward it's as
[2404.32 - 2408.64] if you're bypassing time is as if you're
[2406.68 - 2410.44] moving past time and moving ahead of
[2408.64 - 2412.96] time as you're healing it's an
[2410.44 - 2415.96] incredible experience incredible feeling
[2412.96 - 2417.84] healing the feeling of healing itself
[2415.96 - 2421.40] you know what that feels like you know
[2417.84 - 2424.04] when wait a minute I'm actually better
[2421.40 - 2425.76] than I was wait a minute that symptoms
[2424.04 - 2427.52] calming down wait a minute it's
[2425.76 - 2428.88] intermittent now instead of being all
[2427.52 - 2430.92] the time wait a minute something's
[2428.88 - 2433.96] changing something's happening I'm
[2430.92 - 2437.56] healing I'm moving forward that's a
[2433.96 - 2441.08] feeling that's an experience that is so
[2437.56 - 2442.60] beautiful so amazing all on its own and
[2441.08 - 2444.20] you can feel that experience if you
[2442.60 - 2446.48] haven't yet you will feel that
[2444.20 - 2449.28] experience if you haven't yet keep that
[2446.48 - 2452.08] in mind you'll get in touch with that
[2449.28 - 2454.52] experience and that feeling of I am
[2452.08 - 2456.72] healing and I am moving on medical Med
[2454.52 - 2458.36] information does that it heals people
[2456.72 - 2460.64] that could have never gotten healed
[2458.36 - 2462.96] anywhere else it heals people that were
[2460.64 - 2465.44] so wounded and so bad off from years of
[2462.96 - 2467.16] being sick and had no options anymore
[2465.44 - 2469.44] and they lost hope and it healed them
[2467.16 - 2471.48] medical meme information moves people
[2469.44 - 2473.12] forward gets people out of wheelchairs
[2471.48 - 2475.56] gets them walking again gets them
[2473.12 - 2477.28] exercising and working out again even in
[2475.56 - 2479.28] the gym or whever they want to work out
[2477.28 - 2482.52] or taking hikes and walks it gets them
[2479.28 - 2487.04] back into life you could be in that
[2482.52 - 2487.04] position and get there you can
[2488.44 - 2495.12] our emotional brain puts due dates on
[2491.60 - 2498.20] things just like past due dates on our
[2495.12 - 2500.12] recovery I have to heal before this date
[2498.20 - 2503.00] I have to heal before next week I have
[2500.12 - 2506.16] to heal before my next birthday I have
[2503.00 - 2509.44] to heal before my pet's next birthday I
[2506.16 - 2511.44] have to heal before you know something
[2509.44 - 2514.36] or some event or something happen so we
[2511.44 - 2516.12] put timelines and we put dates on it and
[2514.36 - 2518.24] there's nothing wrong with that we can
[2516.12 - 2521.88] do that okay
[2518.24 - 2525.40] okay Tina says what page are you on on
[2521.88 - 2528.76] Facebook page 94 of brains saver do you
[2525.40 - 2530.12] have brain saver I'm on page 94 it's an
[2528.76 - 2533.72] incredible
[2530.12 - 2536.36] book if you have this you know like what
[2533.72 - 2538.76] this book is
[2536.36 - 2542.88] definitely our emotional brain wants us
[2538.76 - 2545.20] to be healed by a certain time be
[2542.88 - 2548.84] healed on a certain
[2545.20 - 2551.52] time our emotional brain
[2548.84 - 2554.72] wants us to be
[2551.52 - 2558.00] healed it does it
[2554.72 - 2559.64] does and it will shout it in the middle
[2558.00 - 2563.72] of the night when we're sleeping our
[2559.64 - 2565.64] emotional brain will get us into a dream
[2563.72 - 2569.40] where we feel like we're healing in the
[2565.64 - 2569.40] dream or we think we're healed in the
[2569.44 - 2575.04] dream a lot of people
[2572.00 - 2576.72] dream different ways when they're sick
[2575.04 - 2579.68] when they're really sick they dream of
[2576.72 - 2581.80] being sick sick and how difficult it is
[2579.68 - 2584.24] but they also dream of moments when they
[2581.80 - 2586.44] weren't sick and they were strong and
[2584.24 - 2588.28] they felt good and they have dreams
[2586.44 - 2589.80] where they felt good and they were
[2588.28 - 2591.28] living their life and they wake up from
[2589.80 - 2595.60] the dream and they're like I'm not there
[2591.28 - 2598.28] yet that was in the past that was it
[2595.60 - 2601.00] that's not now so so many people dream
[2598.28 - 2603.80] the feelings of like where they were L
[2601.00 - 2606.44] over there on YouTube can neurological
[2603.80 - 2609.24] symptoms get worse as soon as getting on
[2606.44 - 2610.20] an anti viral protocol with propolis and
[2609.24 - 2613.64] cats
[2610.20 - 2616.76] claw keep in mind right get a journal
[2613.64 - 2618.28] out what did I do did I push it too hard
[2616.76 - 2619.76] as I was trying to heal you got to look
[2618.28 - 2621.40] at all these things did I get some
[2619.76 - 2623.48] gluten in my system while I was trying
[2621.40 - 2625.32] to heal did I get some Dairy did I get
[2623.48 - 2627.52] some eggs in something that I ate
[2625.32 - 2629.80] recently did I get corn in something
[2627.52 - 2631.60] that I ate recently did I get soy in
[2629.80 - 2633.64] something that I ate recently kind of
[2631.60 - 2636.28] kind of Journal these things up right
[2633.64 - 2638.00] get a little bit of a of a journal
[2636.28 - 2639.52] together and put it together what did I
[2638.00 - 2641.24] eat yesterday what did I eat the day
[2639.52 - 2642.56] before what did I eat tomorrow what's
[2641.24 - 2644.40] happening emotionally am I under a lot
[2642.56 - 2646.28] of emotional stress am I getting support
[2644.40 - 2648.28] from my family or is my family against
[2646.28 - 2650.12] me am I getting support from my friends
[2648.28 - 2651.56] or my friends against me did something
[2650.12 - 2654.16] happen with my boyfriend did something
[2651.56 - 2655.40] happen with my girlfriend keep in mind
[2654.16 - 2656.96] that there's so many things that can
[2655.40 - 2658.84] happen emotionally that can kick us down
[2656.96 - 2660.64] a notch we're like boom so we're trying
[2658.84 - 2663.88] to get up and we're getting kicked down
[2660.64 - 2666.32] did I catch C you know did I catch like
[2663.88 - 2668.52] you know what I mean did I catch the flu
[2666.32 - 2671.16] did I catch something and I was sick for
[2668.52 - 2672.76] a few weeks ago and now my neurological
[2671.16 - 2675.24] problems are worse but really it's
[2672.76 - 2677.20] because you're recovering from Co or
[2675.24 - 2679.36] you're recovering from the flu three
[2677.20 - 2681.12] weeks ago or a month ago because what
[2679.36 - 2683.20] happens when people get a flu they get a
[2681.12 - 2685.20] cold whatever you want to call it and
[2683.20 - 2686.60] you're you're you're blowing out snot
[2685.20 - 2689.08] and you're you're coughing and
[2686.60 - 2690.40] everything else and now you're
[2689.08 - 2692.48] recovering you're recovering there's
[2690.40 - 2694.20] this weird lag time response that
[2692.48 - 2695.92] happens there's this wake that happens
[2694.20 - 2698.76] and now your neurological problems a
[2695.92 - 2700.00] month later are down here a little bit
[2698.76 - 2701.80] could have been when you started some
[2700.00 - 2704.16] cats claw around that area you started
[2701.80 - 2705.88] some cats claw do your due diligence
[2704.16 - 2708.08] make sure you're looking at everything
[2705.88 - 2709.92] you can a lot of people are so sick
[2708.08 - 2711.88] right now from pathogens going around
[2709.92 - 2713.40] right now they are bed RDS keep that in
[2711.88 - 2716.80] mind right
[2713.40 - 2719.00] now people are bedridden because of the
[2716.80 - 2722.32] flu and the cids that are actually going
[2719.00 - 2726.00] around right now it's bad right now like
[2722.32 - 2727.80] today and next month the month after
[2726.00 - 2729.68] that there's some bugs go it around
[2727.80 - 2731.40] right so people can actually kind of
[2729.68 - 2733.44] hold on to those they catch it they hold
[2731.40 - 2735.20] on to it they're coughing they're just
[2733.44 - 2736.56] you know doing their thing and then they
[2735.20 - 2738.12] get dragged down a little bit with
[2736.56 - 2740.52] neurological problems it becomes a
[2738.12 - 2742.60] trigger so check that out too like in
[2740.52 - 2745.48] your life and your references and go
[2742.60 - 2747.92] back into your journal and look and then
[2745.48 - 2749.76] Foods that's important too okay Foods
[2747.92 - 2751.32] matter if you're feeding something
[2749.76 - 2752.84] that's creating your neurological
[2751.32 - 2755.52] problem what are you feeding your
[2752.84 - 2757.96] neurological problem which is meaning
[2755.52 - 2760.96] like neurological viruses neurological
[2757.96 - 2763.84] pathogens what are you feeding you know
[2760.96 - 2766.28] those pathogens is it the foods that are
[2763.84 - 2768.88] creating more trouble creating more
[2766.28 - 2770.84] neurotoxins or anything like that what
[2768.88 - 2772.60] are you doing did you stop your celery
[2770.84 - 2775.24] juice have you even drank your celery
[2772.60 - 2778.56] juice what's you know all these things
[2775.24 - 2781.88] play a role while you're trying to heal
[2778.56 - 2784.36] so you might be doing some propis and
[2781.88 - 2787.80] then you're having a down cycle but
[2784.36 - 2790.20] propolis can't create a down cycle
[2787.80 - 2792.68] that's how it works cats Cola can't
[2790.20 - 2794.68] create a a down cycle propolis can't
[2792.68 - 2797.24] create a down cycle so what's happening
[2794.68 - 2799.56] in your life examine it take a look and
[2797.24 - 2801.96] see what's going on or were you already
[2799.56 - 2803.96] getting sick and thank God you're doing
[2801.96 - 2805.72] the propolis or whatever you're doing
[2803.96 - 2807.64] you know and did you have a medical
[2805.72 - 2809.72] treatment did you have something else
[2807.64 - 2811.64] out there did you have an x-ray did you
[2809.72 - 2814.68] have radiation exposure didn't know it
[2811.64 - 2816.32] did you get a pesticide drift hit hits
[2814.68 - 2818.52] you from the apartment building next
[2816.32 - 2820.12] door from somebody spraying it guy had a
[2818.52 - 2822.92] mask on he was just spraying it like
[2820.12 - 2825.40] this all in the yard you got to look at
[2822.92 - 2828.20] everything but you got to also have
[2825.40 - 2830.08] faith and trust in the tools but you got
[2828.20 - 2832.00] to look at everything else you have to
[2830.08 - 2835.28] it's important to look at everything
[2832.00 - 2838.72] else but no propolis does not cause a
[2835.28 - 2841.44] down cycle propolis is one of well wait
[2838.72 - 2843.96] a minute well what kind of propolis
[2841.44 - 2845.64] who's propolis that all stuff is there
[2843.96 - 2847.24] alcohol in it is there junk in it what
[2845.64 - 2849.36] kind of that's a whole whole another
[2847.24 - 2851.48] game all on its own you know a lot of
[2849.36 - 2853.36] people don't know about a good propolis
[2851.48 - 2855.20] they don't know about like say vimer
[2853.36 - 2856.76] propolis or something else they just
[2855.20 - 2859.48] they have no
[2856.76 - 2862.36] idea but it's a good question and keep
[2859.48 - 2862.36] the questions coming
[2863.44 - 2868.20] in if you have hyper
[2865.80 - 2871.44] sensitivities your nerves become hyper
[2868.20 - 2874.28] sensitive keep that in mind anything can
[2871.44 - 2877.48] also rock the boat a chemtrail can rock
[2874.28 - 2881.36] the boat one day anything can the heat
[2877.48 - 2883.68] index can rock the boat exercising one
[2881.36 - 2885.20] day you know you're doing a sweat and
[2883.68 - 2887.36] everything you're a little dehydrated
[2885.20 - 2889.48] that can rock the boat maybe you're not
[2887.36 - 2891.00] hydrating enough so many people don't do
[2889.48 - 2893.36] enough for themselves are you drinking
[2891.00 - 2895.24] coconut water you drinking celery juice
[2893.36 - 2898.68] listen to the chemical sensitivity and
[2895.24 - 2901.48] food sensitivity podcasts on medical
[2898.68 - 2903.04] mean podcast at Apple podcast everybody
[2901.48 - 2904.60] wants to heal can I read this little
[2903.04 - 2908.32] spot for you guys everybody wants to
[2904.60 - 2911.56] heal nobody does doesn't want to
[2908.32 - 2914.12] heal no one wants to be sick or suffer
[2911.56 - 2915.84] emotionally no one is afraid of healing
[2914.12 - 2917.92] no one has a fear of healing that's
[2915.84 - 2919.56] secretly holding on that's secretly
[2917.92 - 2922.08] holding them back from getting better
[2919.56 - 2925.96] nobody is being held back because they
[2922.08 - 2927.36] have a fear of healing keep that in mind
[2925.96 - 2929.68] because I'm seeing it more and more
[2927.36 - 2932.44] about manifestation out there and you
[2929.68 - 2936.28] know look I'm I'm not out there to just
[2932.44 - 2938.36] rip into people I've been I've you know
[2936.28 - 2940.40] it's not my thing to just rip into
[2938.36 - 2942.04] people like that where like manif if I
[2940.40 - 2944.52] don't like you know
[2942.04 - 2946.56] manifestation or something like that
[2944.52 - 2948.36] it's not that I don't like manifestation
[2946.56 - 2950.24] it's just
[2948.36 - 2952.44] that it's
[2950.24 - 2954.24] like if someone's sitting there and they
[2952.44 - 2955.72] got a virus and the virus is creating
[2954.24 - 2958.64] chronic fatigue syndrome and the brain
[2955.72 - 2961.68] is swelling and they got Amy you know
[2958.64 - 2964.08] CFS and they can't even driving a car
[2961.68 - 2965.72] and they're just falling apart it's like
[2964.08 - 2967.20] manifestation is not something I'm
[2965.72 - 2969.32] worried about I'm worried worried about
[2967.20 - 2970.20] getting that virus killed off killing
[2969.32 - 2972.76] that
[2970.20 - 2975.56] virus getting the body would it needs to
[2972.76 - 2977.20] fight that virus getting them recovered
[2975.56 - 2978.88] and if you want to play in manifestation
[2977.20 - 2980.92] land after that you can play in
[2978.88 - 2982.24] manifestation land all you want I just
[2980.92 - 2985.20] want you better you know what I mean
[2982.24 - 2989.04] it's like and that's the problem when
[2985.20 - 2991.40] manifestation kind of crawls into crawls
[2989.04 - 2994.36] into the chronic illness world it's a
[2991.40 - 2996.16] tricky tricky blend you know the
[2994.36 - 2997.88] manifestation movement was really
[2996.16 - 2999.72] originally about people that weren't
[2997.88 - 3001.88] sick at all they just weren't sick there
[2999.72 - 3004.96] was lesser numbers of people being sick
[3001.88 - 3006.68] it was for people who were just you know
[3004.96 - 3008.56] they wanted more in their life and they
[3006.68 - 3010.80] wanted good things to happen and it's
[3008.56 - 3012.76] fun right and people can believe in it
[3010.80 - 3015.52] and work with that right but the
[3012.76 - 3017.88] manifestation thing flung into the
[3015.52 - 3019.40] chronically ill world and then made
[3017.88 - 3022.00] everybody in the chronic illness World
[3019.40 - 3024.96] think they manifested their sickness
[3022.00 - 3027.32] that's where the problem went it's not
[3024.96 - 3030.52] that I personally
[3027.32 - 3033.20] you know can't tolerate or disagree or
[3030.52 - 3036.40] hate manifestation that's not it at all
[3033.20 - 3039.00] manifestation mixed into the chronic Leo
[3036.40 - 3041.44] world like a big bag of nuts mixed up
[3039.00 - 3043.36] and what happened was it was like a lot
[3041.44 - 3045.40] of leaders and manifestation that would
[3043.36 - 3047.76] say you're the reason why you're sick
[3045.40 - 3049.84] you created it you did this to yourself
[3047.76 - 3052.48] you wish this upon yourself you
[3049.84 - 3054.24] manifested this now you got to manifest
[3052.48 - 3056.04] out of this sickness and a lot of people
[3054.24 - 3057.40] who chronic leil and sick are trying to
[3056.04 - 3059.92] manifest out out of the sickness but
[3057.40 - 3061.48] they're not getting better how come
[3059.92 - 3063.56] they're trying to manifest them then
[3061.48 - 3064.84] they all of a sudden hate themselves
[3063.56 - 3066.20] they all of a sudden doubt themselves
[3064.84 - 3068.64] and they hate themselves because they're
[3066.20 - 3070.92] like wait a minute I can't even manifest
[3068.64 - 3073.84] properly here I am bedridden on couch
[3070.92 - 3076.04] Island and and Mattress Island and
[3073.84 - 3077.52] obviously I must have created this
[3076.04 - 3079.04] because everybody else who's manifesting
[3077.52 - 3081.72] such good things are doing great things
[3079.04 - 3083.92] out there and they're fine I'm bedridden
[3081.72 - 3085.80] so I'm trying to manifest myself out of
[3083.92 - 3088.64] this but I can't seem to so I'm a
[3085.80 - 3090.80] failure even more not only did I create
[3088.64 - 3092.48] my sickness and illness manifesting the
[3090.80 - 3095.36] wrong way or whatever it was that
[3092.48 - 3097.32] created this I am now a failure because
[3095.36 - 3098.76] I can't get out of it and I'm sick and I
[3097.32 - 3102.92] must have done this to myself and I
[3098.76 - 3105.52] created it for myself that's demented
[3102.92 - 3108.60] and that's sick not the person who
[3105.52 - 3109.84] thinks that but the manifestation laws
[3108.60 - 3112.80] that have been thrown upon the
[3109.84 - 3115.48] chronically ill in the last five six
[3112.80 - 3117.24] years seven years and just eight years
[3115.48 - 3119.80] and I've watched that happened where it
[3117.24 - 3121.12] was like a storm coming over The Chronic
[3119.80 - 3123.76] leil
[3121.12 - 3126.20] like the manifestation
[3123.76 - 3127.64] storm and the chronically old people
[3126.20 - 3129.92] these poor people suffering and
[3127.64 - 3133.00] struggling sick for 10 15 years and it's
[3129.92 - 3134.92] just like mixed just you know boom piled
[3133.00 - 3136.80] on top of them everybody was like I must
[3134.92 - 3138.60] have created this I must be sick because
[3136.80 - 3142.08] I must have manifested it I must have
[3138.60 - 3145.44] made this happen and it's sad no you got
[3142.08 - 3148.48] sick because of other reasons you got
[3145.44 - 3152.28] sick because of yeah epine bar shingles
[3148.48 - 3154.24] cyega virus you got sick because hhb6
[3152.28 - 3157.00] you got sick because herpes simplex one
[3154.24 - 3159.16] and two you got sick because of strep
[3157.00 - 3161.16] you got sick because of toxic heavy
[3159.16 - 3163.20] metals you got sick because of all these
[3161.16 - 3164.68] solvents and pharmaceutical poisons and
[3163.20 - 3167.16] all this other stuff that got into your
[3164.68 - 3169.40] body and yeah you didn't help yourself
[3167.16 - 3170.68] out by not knowing what to eat and you
[3169.40 - 3171.56] were eating things that you probably
[3170.68 - 3173.76] should have been eating and you're
[3171.56 - 3176.68] seeing some of that right here right and
[3173.76 - 3178.24] you're seeing that here sure sure but
[3176.68 - 3180.48] you you know you didn't know you're just
[3178.24 - 3182.52] eating to survive you're just eating to
[3180.48 - 3184.88] try to just get through another day it's
[3182.52 - 3188.04] not your fault but either
[3184.88 - 3189.68] way you got sick along the way because
[3188.04 - 3191.84] of all these other reasons and maybe it
[3189.68 - 3194.64] was emotional stress adding to it maybe
[3191.84 - 3196.72] it was emotional abuse adding to it and
[3194.64 - 3198.52] maybe you got injured in many ways
[3196.72 - 3200.48] emotionally and abused emotionally and
[3198.52 - 3202.12] that packed on to the mercury poisoning
[3200.48 - 3203.64] and all the other vital issues and now
[3202.12 - 3205.88] you're really sick and now you got every
[3203.64 - 3208.92] symptom in the book and then
[3205.88 - 3210.36] manifestation comes along like we got
[3208.92 - 3212.48] the answers for everything you just have
[3210.36 - 3214.40] to manifest it and get yourself out
[3212.48 - 3216.48] that's all it really is you know and
[3214.40 - 3219.04] then and then whoa you're sick because
[3216.48 - 3221.48] that you caused that that's your problem
[3219.04 - 3222.92] 20 doctors you saw that they didn't they
[3221.48 - 3224.44] don't know you know why you're sick you
[3222.92 - 3226.84] don't have the answer so you must have
[3224.44 - 3230.96] manifested this or it's all in your
[3226.84 - 3230.96] head and that's that's what I don't
[3231.64 - 3237.64] like there's also a trusting wire within
[3234.56 - 3239.44] us that's been taking advantage of by
[3237.64 - 3241.84] Industries this has created a
[3239.44 - 3244.40] brainwashing within us a me mechanism
[3241.84 - 3246.24] inside us that wants permission to do
[3244.40 - 3248.88] harmful things to
[3246.24 - 3250.68] ourselves people want permission to do
[3248.88 - 3253.92] harmful things to themselves this the
[3250.68 - 3255.84] desire for health is so strong inside us
[3253.92 - 3257.76] that we'll try to look for answers about
[3255.84 - 3261.36] why anything that's harmful could be
[3257.76 - 3263.80] good for us I just saw an article that
[3261.36 - 3266.40] somebody sent me a friend sent me there
[3263.80 - 3268.80] an article about once again red wine red
[3266.40 - 3271.88] red wine is good for
[3268.80 - 3275.08] you red wine is good for you that I just
[3271.88 - 3278.36] saw that again the red wine is good for
[3275.08 - 3280.92] you it was unbelievable once again I saw
[3278.36 - 3284.60] this again chocolate is good for
[3280.92 - 3286.60] you chocolate is good for you black tea

[3286.60 - 3291.72] you sure you know you believe that when
[3290.16 - 3294.32] you're chronic Leo with a neurological
[3291.72 - 3300.84] problem you're just going to go like
[3294.32 - 3300.84] this black tea chocolate coffee red
[3302.72 - 3307.20] wine you're going to be down there is
[3304.76 - 3309.40] where you're going to be yeah it's
[3307.20 - 3311.20] amazing but you'll see that right you'll
[3309.40 - 3312.84] see it just saw another like somebody
[3311.20 - 3314.84] sent me that article and it's like here
[3312.84 - 3316.04] it is this is good for you that's good
[3314.84 - 3318.40] for you this is good for you it's like
[3316.04 - 3321.04] no if you're sick with chronic illness
[3318.40 - 3324.12] bad for you bad for you bad for you bad
[3321.04 - 3326.80] for you will destroy your life bad for
[3324.12 - 3330.08] you especially if you do too much of it
[3326.80 - 3333.24] like too much of it too much of it
[3330.08 - 3336.28] medical medum information out there only
[3333.24 - 3340.32] only used chocolate for a couple of
[3336.28 - 3343.08] things one is to get people off of
[3340.32 - 3344.08] heroin it was a tool to get people off
[3343.08 - 3347.28] of
[3344.08 - 3351.32] heroin it was a tool to get people off
[3347.28 - 3354.64] of cigarettes to use chocolate like a
[3351.32 - 3356.80] really high quality cacao to get you off
[3354.64 - 3358.56] of cigarettes so medical me information
[3356.80 - 3360.36] throughout the years and I used to try
[3358.56 - 3362.36] to help people they used to come to my
[3360.36 - 3365.52] office throughout the
[3362.36 - 3367.76] decades and and spirit of compassion
[3365.52 - 3370.12] said chocolate's not good for somebody
[3367.76 - 3371.72] who's chronically ill chocolate will not
[3370.12 - 3373.60] help their adrenals chocolate will
[3371.72 - 3375.08] destroy their adrenals CH chocolate will
[3373.60 - 3377.72] do all these things if they regularly
[3375.08 - 3379.80] eat it but Spirit of compassion said
[3377.72 - 3382.64] it's either that or the heroin kills
[3379.80 - 3384.28] them it's either that or the other drug
[3382.64 - 3386.52] kills them it's either that or they
[3384.28 - 3388.36] can't get off of smokes it's either that
[3386.52 - 3391.24] or if they can't get now they can't get
[3388.36 - 3395.64] off of vape and you there's a way to use
[3391.24 - 3397.84] it as a leverage until they can get off
[3395.64 - 3401.12] of something that's literally killing
[3397.84 - 3404.60] them fast to get them all of a sudden on
[3401.12 - 3406.68] something that you know is you know much
[3404.60 - 3409.16] less
[3406.68 - 3410.88] aggressive theah says over there in
[3409.16 - 3413.04] YouTube he has a podcast about using
[3410.88 - 3417.88] chocolate for
[3413.04 - 3417.88] addiction I forgot about that
[3418.52 - 3424.44] everybody wants to
[3421.28 - 3426.64] heal everybody wants to
[3424.44 - 3427.96] heal so I'm talking about the trusting
[3426.64 - 3430.48] wire so I want to go a little bit more
[3427.96 - 3433.00] into this is really good okay right here
[3430.48 - 3434.32] all right the desire for health is so
[3433.00 - 3435.92] strong inside of us that we'll try to
[3434.32 - 3437.76] look for answers about why anything
[3435.92 - 3441.12] that's harmful could be good for us like
[3437.76 - 3444.16] wine red wine my God if I see that one
[3441.12 - 3448.16] more time one more
[3444.16 - 3448.16] time it's almost like
[3448.24 - 3453.64] that's almost like a demon in the
[3450.52 - 3455.88] industry it's like haaha another three
[3453.64 - 3458.08] years went by people forget let's put it
[3455.88 - 3461.08] out there one more time red wine is good
[3458.08 - 3462.84] for you three years go by four years go
[3461.08 - 3464.36] by it gives permission to people
[3462.84 - 3465.52] permission to drink more red wine and
[3464.36 - 3467.52] kill their liver or whatever they're
[3465.52 - 3469.56] going to do right it's not helping them
[3467.52 - 3471.04] out and then a demon comes out again and
[3469.56 - 3473.16] puts it out the industry and it's just a
[3471.04 - 3475.40] demon industry says red wine is good for
[3473.16 - 3477.56] you again and does it all over again so
[3475.40 - 3479.24] people in their are like you know after
[3477.56 - 3481.60] they've destroyed their health you know
[3479.24 - 3482.92] in universities and college and drank
[3481.60 - 3484.44] themselves practically to death and
[3482.92 - 3485.80] they're trying to recover all of a
[3484.44 - 3487.64] sudden they hear a demon out there in
[3485.80 - 3489.52] the industry say red wine is good for
[3487.64 - 3490.72] you so they go back to drinking red wine
[3489.52 - 3492.28] and they think it's good for them they
[3490.72 - 3493.72] drink it when they're pregnant they
[3492.28 - 3495.24] drink it when they're two weeks pregnant
[3493.72 - 3497.08] three weeks pregnant they just whatever
[3495.24 - 3498.96] they're drinking it and they're just
[3497.08 - 3501.00] back to you know doing something stupid
[3498.96 - 3502.56] again and then when they get past it and
[3501.00 - 3504.28] they realize the red wine is making them
[3502.56 - 3506.48] bloated and sick and not good and
[3504.28 - 3507.92] they're getting sick a demon in the
[3506.48 - 3509.48] industry comes out again and puts out
[3507.92 - 3511.56] another article and says red wine is
[3509.48 - 3515.40] good for you it it's almost like a
[3511.56 - 3515.40] massive trick that's it's
[3516.16 - 3520.60] unbelievable we want validation that
[3518.80 - 3522.44] hurting ourselves is actually good for
[3520.60 - 3524.52] us this can make it seem as if

[3524.52 - 3529.00] emotional nature as if we want to harm
[3527.00 - 3531.12] ourselves when we really don't we don't
[3529.00 - 3534.72] want to harm ourselves we don't and our

[3871.04 - 3875.84] chronically sick for a long time medical
[3873.56 - 3878.16] mem shock therapies are critical to this
[3875.84 - 3880.04] day and age because that's what's
[3878.16 - 3882.96] happened here the reason I'm going to
[3880.04 - 3884.40] the medical meme shock therapies is
[3882.96 - 3886.64] things have gotten so bad out there like
[3884.40 - 3888.20] I said how I opened up this episode with
[3886.64 - 3890.40] about people aren't thinking right
[3888.20 - 3892.24] people aren't feeling good the amount of
[3890.40 - 3895.04] sickness and illness is going crazy
[3892.24 - 3897.76] people are dying left and right just
[3895.04 - 3899.44] dropping out there there are protocols
[3897.76 - 3900.88] in this book for neurological symptoms
[3899.44 - 3902.64] and conditions I'm just talking about
[3900.88 - 3905.40] medical M shock therapies but there's
[3902.64 - 3908.52] full protocols in here in this book for
[3905.40 - 3911.32] neurological symptoms and so forth as
[3908.52 - 3914.32] Darkness tries to destroy all that's
[3911.32 - 3916.60] good and if that doesn't sound right to
[3914.32 - 3919.68] you if it
[3916.60 - 3921.40] doesn't then you're in a really really
[3919.68 - 3924.80] mighty fine
[3921.40 - 3929.52] bubble you're in a mighty fine bubble if
[3924.80 - 3932.16] that's if that line right there doesn't
[3929.52 - 3934.68] resonate as Darkness tries to destroy
[3932.16 - 3937.40] all that's good we Rise Against Darkness
[3934.68 - 3940.84] using light created Health weapons to
[3937.40 - 3944.84] regain empowerment and that's what s so
[3940.84 - 3947.80] is and that's what s so has done right
[3944.84 - 3951.36] there Spirit of compassion has put in
[3947.80 - 3951.36] these books those
[3952.48 - 3959.00] weapons light created Health weapons to
[3955.36 - 3962.32] regain gain empowerment yeah because it
[3959.00 - 3964.00] matters when you're sick gaining Health
[3962.32 - 3967.60] empowerment is
[3964.00 - 3969.48] critical as The Changing Times bring did
[3967.60 - 3972.16] I just say Changing
[3969.48 - 3973.40] Times we talking about ending times what
[3972.16 - 3975.28] kind of times are we talking about
[3973.40 - 3977.00] because a lot of people are are feeling
[3975.28 - 3978.88] like ending times are coming A lot of
[3977.00 - 3980.40] people are feeling something's coming
[3978.88 - 3984.40] Spirit of compassion always called it
[3980.40 - 3986.08] the quickening in these 40 years I've
[3984.40 - 3987.88] been trying to get the word out since I
[3986.08 - 3989.08] was a kid and spirit of compassion has

[3989.08 - 3993.88] quickening Spirit of compassion has be
[3992.20 - 3995.68] you know calling it Changing Times as
[3993.88 - 3998.56] these Changing
[3995.68 - 4001.08] Times okay bring additional stress Upon
[3998.56 - 4003.04] Us humankind goes into a deeper Health
[4001.08 - 4005.80] deficit if you don't think humankind is
[4003.04 - 4007.32] going into a deeper Health deficit then
[4005.80 - 4011.84] I got news for
[4007.32 - 4014.52] you it is and the funny thing is too A
[4011.84 - 4016.92] lot of those stats are just all being
[4014.52 - 4018.72] buried there are more sicker people out
[4016.92 - 4020.20] there than anybody knows and sure you
[4018.72 - 4021.96] might be around people that aren't quite
[4020.20 - 4024.48] sick yet but they got something going on
[4021.96 - 4026.72] you know but whoa is it getting worse
[4024.48 - 4026.72] and
[4026.92 - 4032.64] worse humankind goes into a deeper
[4029.60 - 4035.28] Health deficit than during previous
[4032.64 - 4037.32] decades this is the decade right here
[4035.28 - 4039.20] that we're in where it's all shifting
[4037.32 - 4042.32] right now in spirit of compassion saw
[4039.20 - 4043.68] that coming 5 years ago and forewarn me
[4042.32 - 4044.96] to forewarn everybody that we're going
[4043.68 - 4046.44] to see a level of sickness that we've
[4044.96 - 4049.12] never seen before before and guess what
[4046.44 - 4051.20] it's going there we're in it and we're
[4049.12 - 4053.48] in that decade right now wait till we
[4051.20 - 4053.48] get to
[4053.64 - 4061.96] 2030 Spirit of compassion tells me that
[4057.56 - 4063.52] 2030 isn't a landmark of time because it
[4061.96 - 4069.04] lands on 3
[4063.52 - 4071.52] 0 or 2030 because it's the end of the
[4069.04 - 4073.44] decade Spirit of compassion says it's a
[4071.52 - 4077.52] year that's going to sum up a lot of
[4073.44 - 4079.84] what this decade really really was about
[4077.52 - 4083.20] for a lot of reasons and it's going to
[4079.84 - 4085.64] be extremely visible for so many people
[4083.20 - 4088.40] at that point of what's going on in the
[4085.64 - 4088.40] chronic illness
[4088.88 - 4094.00] World sickness now dominates the lives
[4092.08 - 4097.76] of billions of people medical medium

[4112.32 - 4118.64] of it the industries are playing dirty

[4118.64 - 4123.04] is what you

[4123.04 - 4127.04] to them that they're not even aware of

[4132.80 - 4136.88] evildoers there's some great notes in

[4231.44 - 4235.00] symptom individually that's also the
[4233.28 - 4236.60] best way to do it too I tell friends and
[4235.00 - 4238.80] family out

[4701.40 - 4705.28] things watch out for gluten too you got
[4703.60 - 4708.12] to look out for the troublemaker foods
[4705.28 - 4711.24] which I have written about extensively
[4708.12 - 4711.24] in the medical medium
[4711.56 - 4715.20] books okay we got a question right there
[4714.04 - 4719.20] on
[4715.20 - 4721.68] YouTube sick boy on YouTube says will
[4719.20 - 4724.04] the events be
[4721.68 - 4726.32] broadcasted get ready for this answer
[4724.04 - 4728.00] okay we are looking into this to see if
[4726.32 - 4731.68] we can live
[4728.00 - 4735.32] stream so people who couldn't make it to
[4731.68 - 4737.80] this these events could see it because
[4735.32 - 4739.40] of the limited space in the restaurants
[4737.80 - 4741.84] and they can't be there because there
[4739.40 - 4743.88] was only 200 tickets it's 120 for one
[4741.84 - 4747.00] restaurant 80 for another
[4743.88 - 4749.00] restaurant because of that we're going
[4747.00 - 4750.84] to see if we can live stream it and
[4749.00 - 4752.40] we're going to fight for it in the sense
[4750.84 - 4753.92] where we're going to try to get the
[4752.40 - 4755.24] right people with the right equipment
[4753.92 - 4756.84] and right everything and we're going to
[4755.24 - 4759.64] do everything we can to try to live
[4756.84 - 4762.52] stream this if we can I can't make
[4759.64 - 4764.52] promises I can't make promises on that
[4762.52 - 4766.68] but like true medical median fashion I
[4764.52 - 4768.84] will will do my best my team will do
[4766.68 - 4770.88] their best to try to live stream this
[4768.84 - 4772.80] with everything we have and you never
[4770.88 - 4774.56] know we might be able to do it unless
[4772.80 - 4776.00] there's some massive glitch and we can't
[4774.56 - 4778.48] or something falls through we're going
[4776.00 - 4781.48] to give it a shot
[4778.48 - 4784.32] and if we can do the it's expensive to
[4781.48 - 4786.56] Li live stream live stream how about
[4784.32 - 4789.56] that that's pretty funny it's expensive
[4786.56 - 4793.12] to live stream in the way we like to do
[4789.56 - 4796.20] it which is like the professional Pro
[4793.12 - 4799.12] high quality High Tech way that's really
[4796.20 - 4801.72] expensive so and um we're going to try
[4799.12 - 4804.52] to pull it off it's right anyway you
[4801.72 - 4806.04] guys I this this concludes some of our
[4804.52 - 4807.96] chronic illness talk which I want to
[4806.04 - 4809.48] talk more about as we go along I'll try
[4807.96 - 4811.60] to do another live and then go through
[4809.48 - 4813.00] symptoms and see what's going on with
[4811.60 - 4815.12] you guys and everything take the medical
[4813.00 - 4818.08] medium books to your doctor if you'd
[4815.12 - 4821.24] like show them the the shock therapies
[4818.08 - 4824.28] or anything else okay and it will be
[4821.24 - 4827.08] free to you if we live stream it but not
[4824.28 - 4829.44] free to us not free to me but it'll be
[4827.08 - 4832.00] free to you if we live stream it that's
[4829.44 - 4834.56] what we want all right you guys
