[100.00 - 104.08] you guys i'm making a mashed potato with
[102.64 - 106.00] some peas
[104.08 - 107.68] and it's a simple dish you can throw
[106.00 - 109.52] spices in there if you want you can do
[107.68 - 112.00] that you can throw onion powder in there
[109.52 - 113.60] you can throw garlic powder in there you
[112.00 - 115.28] can throw a little garlic in there too
[113.60 - 116.08] if you really want i'm keeping it real
[115.28 - 118.00] simple
[116.08 - 119.68] to show that that you know for other
[118.00 - 121.36] people who are sensitive garlic or
[119.68 - 122.72] sensitive with onion or something that
[121.36 - 125.12] they can have it's so
[122.72 - 126.64] simple how cool is that it'll be fun
[125.12 - 127.52] though it really will be and it'll taste
[126.64 - 129.76] good too
[127.52 - 131.20] and if you really wanted to add a little
[129.76 - 133.04] bit of sea salt or
[131.20 - 134.88] a little bit of a high quality salt
[133.04 - 137.04] because you're doing salt anyway
[134.88 - 138.08] because i realize i can't get people off
[137.04 - 140.64] of salt
[138.08 - 142.40] if i want to get them off of salt that i
[140.64 - 144.88] can't get a lot of people off of it
[142.40 - 145.92] it's like salt salt salt on everything
[144.88 - 149.28] salt and all the food
[145.92 - 150.88] lorraine l good to see you uh glad you
[149.28 - 153.44] guys are coming on really do
[150.88 - 154.80] lorraine wow man you i all i know is
[153.44 - 155.52] i've been reading your comments on
[154.80 - 158.88] youtube
[155.52 - 160.64] and my mind gets blown because
[158.88 - 162.16] i think i think someone's on there i
[160.64 - 163.84] think it was some dude on there and he
[162.16 - 165.36] was really nice guy
[163.84 - 167.36] he was a really nice guy and he was
[165.36 - 169.20] talking about how
[167.36 - 170.96] on youtube he was talking about how i
[169.20 - 173.68] think of whatever is that
[170.96 - 174.48] that medical medium information can help
[173.68 - 177.04] some people
[174.48 - 178.96] but not help others and you were like
[177.04 - 180.40] well it depends on how you look at it
[178.96 - 182.40] there's so many different options
[180.40 - 184.24] there's a thousand different protocols
[182.40 - 185.44] you can customize it to what's happening
[184.24 - 187.76] in your life
[185.44 - 188.72] and and that's the difference and the
[187.76 - 190.88] difference is that
[188.72 - 192.56] you can heal with the information
[190.88 - 194.16] because there's so much you got the
[192.56 - 196.64] spiritual information
[194.16 - 199.12] you got the the physical causes you've
[196.64 - 202.16] got supplements and dosages
[199.12 - 203.04] and so i think people jump the gun a lot
[202.16 - 206.48] and they'll say
[203.04 - 209.60] like you know i didn't get better on mm
[206.48 - 212.00] when when millions have around the world
[209.60 - 213.28] and because they applied the tools they
[212.00 - 215.60] applied them
[213.28 - 216.64] so it's really a matter of like reading
[215.60 - 220.00] the books
[216.64 - 222.16] learning and healing
[220.00 - 224.32] so you got cleansed heal by the way you
[222.16 - 224.88] guys i mean that's on sale on amazon.com
[224.32 - 228.16] us
[224.88 - 231.44] it's really incredible 16.99
[228.16 - 232.64] this is 17 on amazon us the
[231.44 - 234.80] medical medium that's got plague
[232.64 - 236.88] information in there too i think what
[234.80 - 237.68] happens is that a lot of people were
[236.88 - 240.00] stuck
[237.68 - 240.80] they were stuck inside the house they
[240.00 - 243.68] were stuck
[240.80 - 244.96] home and they were locked in so many
[243.68 - 246.96] people were locked in
[244.96 - 248.08] and stuck with the plague and everything
[246.96 - 250.80] and they were just eating
[248.08 - 252.08] and eating and eating with the stress
[250.80 - 253.76] and then eating and i don't blame i
[252.08 - 254.72] don't blame anybody it's just it can
[253.76 - 257.52] happen

[377.12 - 381.76] it's it overheats the brain boom
[380.08 - 383.12] electricity is going on electricity is
[381.76 - 389.04] going on right
[383.12 - 391.20] and now now some other stuff happens too
[389.04 - 392.88] electricity is pumping through your head
[391.20 - 396.24] so what happens
[392.88 - 398.72] and your adrenals start pumping
[396.24 - 399.44] brain starts overheating adrenals start
[398.72 - 401.28] cranking
[399.44 - 402.80] brain starts overheating adrenals start
[401.28 - 403.68] cranking that's what happens right there
[402.80 - 406.56] to everybody
[403.68 - 408.24] okay and then here comes the food here
[406.56 - 410.32] comes the food maybe
[408.24 - 412.40] maybe you're somebody avoiding the food
[410.32 - 412.80] maybe you're you're doing the caffeine
[412.40 - 414.32] you're
[412.80 - 415.92] you're cranking the chocolate the matcha
[414.32 - 417.84] tea maybe you're cranking the coffee
[415.92 - 420.24] espressos and you're trying to
[417.84 - 421.68] avoid the inevitable you're trying to
[420.24 - 423.92] avoid
[421.68 - 424.96] you know eating and then when you do eat
[423.92 - 427.36] at the end of the day
[424.96 - 428.80] it's a whole bunch of stuff and so we're
[427.36 - 430.32] gonna talk about glucose mineral salts
[428.80 - 433.84] how that's missing
[430.32 - 436.48] uh how why we get so hungry in our
[433.84 - 438.64] brain because that's where the hunger's
[436.48 - 441.28] really really stemming from
[438.64 - 442.72] it's from the brain liver too it's
[441.28 - 444.32] another one i'll cover that a little bit
[442.72 - 444.88] so let me just get going with the food
[444.32 - 448.00] too
[444.88 - 451.04] a little bit so good
[448.00 - 451.84] good that you guys are coming on what
[451.04 - 456.32] happens to
[451.84 - 459.52] almost everybody is insulin resistance
[456.32 - 460.32] is stopping sugar from getting to your
[459.52 - 462.24] brain
[460.32 - 464.00] right there so that's happening to
[462.24 - 467.60] everybody really so
[464.00 - 467.60] you got glucose right so
[468.24 - 472.56] okay you guys got the glucose
[471.28 - 474.80] so everything you eat that's a
[472.56 - 475.68] carbohydrate you eat some fruit you have
[474.80 - 478.32] some
[475.68 - 480.24] whatever you have like potato fruit if
[478.32 - 483.36] you have something else that's sweet
[480.24 - 484.72] right whatever it is that glucose is how
[483.36 - 486.64] your brain functions
[484.72 - 488.40] right there it's that glucose glucose
[486.64 - 490.48] has to get to your brain
[488.40 - 492.16] it's hard to get to the brain when all
[490.48 - 494.16] this fats in the way so when you're
[492.16 - 496.64] eating all this fat
[494.16 - 497.28] it's hard to get the glucose to your
[496.64 - 499.36] brain
[497.28 - 501.12] the fat stops the glucose from getting
[499.36 - 503.04] to your brain
[501.12 - 504.40] that's what happens you get the insulin
[503.04 - 507.92] resistance
[504.40 - 510.56] your cells want to take in that sugar
[507.92 - 511.44] but the fats in the way that's how it
[510.56 - 513.20] works
[511.44 - 515.60] so you're gonna inevitably overeat
[513.20 - 516.96] because your brain is gonna be starving
[515.60 - 518.72] chris good to see you
[516.96 - 520.00] yeah mangoes you know i'll do two or
[518.72 - 524.56] three manuals in the morning
[520.00 - 526.64] right heard from someone that the brain
[524.56 - 528.08] needs fat not glucose it's
[526.64 - 530.56] misinformation out there
[528.08 - 532.72] that's a sad thing so michelle michelle
[530.56 - 534.56] brown thanks for that comment
[532.72 - 538.08] of course you're going to hear that but
[534.56 - 541.20] did you know that your brain
[538.08 - 542.88] check this out you guys did you know
[541.20 - 545.12] jerry says i definitely used to feel
[542.88 - 547.20] like that especially around my period
[545.12 - 548.88] since 369 since the medical meaning
[547.20 - 551.68] three six nine it
[548.88 - 553.44] it disappeared completely because when
[551.68 - 555.36] you're doing the 369 you were getting
[553.44 - 557.68] glucose
[555.36 - 559.60] and you were getting mineral salts so
[557.68 - 561.28] glucose and mineral salts okay that's
[559.60 - 563.04] what you guys were getting right
[561.28 - 565.52] and we're doing some medical medium
[563.04 - 566.80] school you guys cool with that
[565.52 - 568.48] you guys cool with a little medical
[566.80 - 570.24] medium school today are you guys alright
[568.48 - 572.88] with that are you guys sick of school
[570.24 - 573.36] what's up so that's because you're
[572.88 - 576.00] getting
[573.36 - 577.36] your mineral salts and your glucose and
[576.00 - 580.48] that was stopping
[577.36 - 581.20] the want for overeating so that really
[580.48 - 582.64] helps so
[581.20 - 585.84] check this out you love medical medium
[582.64 - 587.28] school lissieco good to see you today
[585.84 - 588.88] here's an important thing to understand
[587.28 - 589.68] right we're told that the brain needs
[588.88 - 592.96] fat
[589.68 - 596.64] that's misinformation the brain needs
[592.96 - 597.52] sugar in five seconds if your brain
[596.64 - 600.64] doesn't get
[597.52 - 604.16] glucose sugar in five
[600.64 - 607.28] seconds it starts to die
[604.16 - 608.64] you will die if your brain doesn't get
[607.28 - 611.28] sugar in time
[608.64 - 612.80] did you know that did you guys know that
[611.28 - 615.04] very important to know okay
[612.80 - 616.88] so let's cover that a little bit now why
[615.04 - 618.24] is there so much misinformation out
[616.88 - 620.80] there
[618.24 - 622.48] it's really sad because no one knows why
[620.80 - 623.12] anybody's sick so then if no one knows
[622.48 - 624.72] why
[623.12 - 626.24] no one's sick no one knows what causes
[624.72 - 627.44] chronic illness no one knows why people
[626.24 - 628.48] are suffering and struggling and you
[627.44 - 632.64] learn that
[628.48 - 635.04] when you get sick you learn that fast
[632.64 - 635.76] you learn that when you don't get better
[635.04 - 637.76] better
[635.76 - 639.28] and you just keep on spiraling in
[637.76 - 641.04] sickness and you've been to your 10th
[639.28 - 642.24] functional medicine doctor and your 10th
[641.04 - 644.48] specialist
[642.24 - 645.28] and your 10th neurologist and you can't
[644.48 - 647.20] get better
[645.28 - 649.28] and you realize nobody knows why
[647.20 - 651.60] anybody's sick and no one really they're
[649.28 - 655.12] all just it's all guessing games okay
[651.60 - 659.76] and what happens is if your brain
[655.12 - 663.20] doesn't get sugar in under 10 seconds
[659.76 - 665.60] it starts to die guess what
[663.20 - 667.76] if your brain doesn't get fat within 10
[665.60 - 672.56] seconds
[667.76 - 675.68] it starts to heal it starts to heal
[672.56 - 677.92] interesting interesting okay
[675.68 - 679.44] think about how important that is if
[677.92 - 684.48] your brain doesn't get sugar
[679.44 - 686.80] within 10 seconds it starts to die
[684.48 - 689.76] really important information really
[686.80 - 691.28] really is
[689.76 - 693.44] get a little seam in this pan try to
[691.28 - 696.64] cool this pan off a little bit too
[693.44 - 699.04] have that baby pump in okay
[696.64 - 701.28] your brain is made out of hardened
[699.04 - 702.72] glycogen you guys
[701.28 - 704.56] your brain is made out of hardened
[702.72 - 706.88] glycogen you know what that is
[704.56 - 710.80] sugar your brain is made out of sugar
[706.88 - 713.36] it's only got traces of fat in the brain
[710.80 - 714.32] did you know if you eat a brain it's
[713.36 - 717.68] sweet
[714.32 - 721.04] did you know it's sweet
[717.68 - 724.64] it's actually sweet it's glycogen
[721.04 - 727.68] that's been concentrated and hardened
[724.64 - 728.64] glucose running through the brain is the
[727.68 - 731.44] only way
[728.64 - 732.00] to truly keep the brain alive you remove
[731.44 - 735.84] it
[732.00 - 738.80] you die that's it interesting
[735.84 - 740.24] isn't that incredible right so where did
[738.80 - 741.76] the theories come from about your brain
[740.24 - 745.04] needs fat
[741.76 - 749.52] it was a theory to sell
[745.04 - 751.68] products fat-based it was a trend
[749.52 - 753.12] a trend so it's like well your brain
[751.68 - 754.80] needs fat because there's fat in your
[753.12 - 755.60] brain there's a little bit of fat in
[754.80 - 757.36] your brain
[755.60 - 760.96] a little bit other than that brain
[757.36 - 760.96] tissue is made out of glycogen
[761.04 - 765.04] you know it's disappointing really when
[763.36 - 768.24] i think about it
[765.04 - 771.36] like how come people can't get it right
[768.24 - 773.20] out there what's going on out there
[771.36 - 775.28] and back to the same thing nobody knows
[773.20 - 776.56] why you got hashimoto's thyroiditis
[775.28 - 778.56] nobody knows why you got eczema
[776.56 - 780.64] psoriasis did you know i saw somebody
[778.56 - 782.56] i saw somebody that someone showed me
[780.64 - 785.28] something right
[782.56 - 786.40] that someone took medical medium
[785.28 - 789.04] information
[786.40 - 790.40] which is that psoriasis is caused by
[789.04 - 792.88] toxic heavy metals
[790.40 - 794.16] copper specifically right and they took
[792.88 - 795.92] that and they get incited back to
[794.16 - 797.76] medical medium there's no study
[795.92 - 798.96] there's no science behind it and a
[797.76 - 802.24] doctor
[798.96 - 804.40] put it on his thing that psoriasis toxic
[802.24 - 806.00] heavy metals right
[804.40 - 807.60] well the only reason why the doctor knew
[806.00 - 808.88] that was because of medical media books
[807.60 - 813.04] and information
[808.88 - 816.00] okay it's almost like so you don't have
[813.04 - 817.44] anything on chronic illness unless you
[816.00 - 819.68] take it for a medical medium
[817.44 - 821.28] fact that's what i'm seeing out there
[819.68 - 822.56] it's really sad or they'll just say it's
[821.28 - 823.76] all in your gut and in the end you'll
[822.56 - 826.00] just stay sick
[823.76 - 827.12] libya says he supports people who eat
[826.00 - 829.44] meat too
[827.12 - 830.16] it's all about healing for everyone yeah
[829.44 - 833.20] this isn't
[830.16 - 834.00] this isn't vegan propaganda anti-animal
[833.20 - 837.36] protein
[834.00 - 838.24] uh campaign propaganda cold white spring
[837.36 - 840.40] good to see you
[838.24 - 842.64] so good to hear the voice of reason
[840.40 - 843.76] again i'm honored truly cold white
[842.64 - 845.92] screen
[843.76 - 847.84] but here's the thing i feel the same way
[845.92 - 849.44] about you
[847.84 - 850.88] because when i read your comments i'm
[849.44 - 852.64] like voice of reason
[850.88 - 854.16] there's when i read your comments cold
[852.64 - 857.36] white spring it's always like yeah
[854.16 - 858.88] voice of reason you know
[857.36 - 861.12] darlene says oh my god i'm eating a
[858.88 - 862.32] potato wrap right now it's funny yum yum
[861.12 - 864.80] lemon balm love hey
[862.32 - 865.52] another voice of reason podcast doctors
[864.80 - 868.56] always steal
[865.52 - 870.40] mm info fact
[868.56 - 872.00] podcast doctor so we steal medical
[870.40 - 873.84] medium information i'm going to take the
[872.00 - 876.48] skin off the potato first of all
[873.84 - 878.24] i always eat the skin on potatoes so
[876.48 - 878.96] it's an incredible nutritious part of
[878.24 - 881.28] the potato
[878.96 - 882.80] absolutely but i'm making a fun mashed
[881.28 - 884.96] potato dish
[882.80 - 888.16] right so i'm kind of removing some of
[884.96 - 891.60] the skin on here
[888.16 - 894.40] podcast doctors steal
[891.60 - 896.16] medical medium information it's not
[894.40 - 900.72] published anywhere else
[896.16 - 902.48] the medical medium books right and
[900.72 - 904.32] they take it so now all of a sudden
[902.48 - 906.00] psoriasis is caused by toxic heavy metal
[904.32 - 909.12] there's no study
[906.00 - 912.08] they haven't discovered in science
[909.12 - 914.32] it came from spirit of compassion that
[912.08 - 917.28] the cause of psoriasis
[914.32 - 919.36] is copper a toxic heavy metal it's cause
[917.28 - 924.32] of partly cause of
[919.36 - 926.32] eczema two right so
[924.32 - 928.16] when it comes down to everything like
[926.32 - 930.40] information about the brain if you want
[928.16 - 932.24] to know more about the brain
[930.40 - 933.68] you're not going to hear reason out
[932.24 - 934.40] there because when they say your brain
[933.68 - 936.32] needs fat
[934.40 - 937.68] and your brain is made out of fat two
[936.32 - 939.36] strikes against
[937.68 - 941.76] the industry right there they alter the
[939.36 - 942.88] fraud industry the fraud alternative
[941.76 - 945.12] industry
[942.88 - 947.84] problem is with the alternative industry
[945.12 - 951.28] basically most of it's all fraud
[947.84 - 952.88] and you know all my friends are
[951.28 - 954.72] alternative doctors
[952.88 - 957.04] incredible ones though at least they
[954.72 - 959.04] they they know the difference right
[957.04 - 961.44] but and then there's the conventional
[959.04 - 963.44] system too is is fraudulent
[961.44 - 965.28] it's completely fraudulent especially in
[963.44 - 969.04] the virus world
[965.28 - 970.96] really fraudulent and with virus
[969.04 - 972.40] all it's always the wrong information
[970.96 - 974.56] about viruses
[972.40 - 975.76] the wrong information about all of it
[974.56 - 979.76] i'm taking the skin
[975.76 - 981.36] off of these potatoes you guys uh
[979.76 - 984.72] you guys coming on here i'm honored
[981.36 - 988.88] you're here we got lots to talk about
[984.72 - 990.80] right and we're making some mashed
[988.88 - 992.40] potatoes i got a pan that's hot i got
[990.80 - 993.76] frozen peas right here so i hope you
[992.40 - 996.96] stick around for that it's an
[993.76 - 998.88] easy recipe it's gentle on the system
[996.96 - 1000.08] i'm only peeling the potato not because
[998.88 - 1001.92] skins aren't good for you they're
[1000.08 - 1004.24] incredible for you that's actually an
[1001.92 - 1006.88] amazing part of the potato
[1004.24 - 1008.72] but this is more of hey it's a comfort
[1006.88 - 1010.08] meal i'm making some comfort food since
[1008.72 - 1011.36] we're talking about it because that's
[1010.08 - 1012.96] the other thing too
[1011.36 - 1014.64] making some comfort food since we're
[1012.96 - 1015.52] talking about overeating we're talking
[1014.64 - 1019.44] about
[1015.52 - 1022.40] uh emotional eating too right
[1019.44 - 1025.04] and how stress plays a role the brain
[1022.40 - 1028.48] gets hot
[1025.04 - 1030.80] so you guys check out medical mean
[1028.48 - 1032.96] podcast at apple podcast
[1030.80 - 1035.36] you know if you can catch up on some of
[1032.96 - 1037.12] the episodes the blood draw episode is
[1035.36 - 1039.44] really critical to know
[1037.12 - 1041.52] because you're just going to get caught
[1039.44 - 1042.96] getting too much blood taken from you
[1041.52 - 1044.40] you're going to lose your immune system
[1042.96 - 1046.56] part of your immune system it's going to
[1044.40 - 1047.36] make you susceptible to other problems i
[1046.56 - 1049.04] think
[1047.36 - 1050.84] i have to bring up the blood draw
[1049.04 - 1052.48] problem once in a while because if i
[1050.84 - 1053.92] don't
[1052.48 - 1055.36] if i don't people are just going to
[1053.92 - 1056.40] forget they're going to get their blood
[1055.36 - 1058.08] tests
[1056.40 - 1059.44] the doctor's going to take too much
[1058.08 - 1061.12] blood
[1059.44 - 1063.60] and you're going to get you know five
[1061.12 - 1065.04] vials five full vials seven full vials
[1063.60 - 1066.80] eight full vials of blood and
[1065.04 - 1068.08] want to remind everybody if you guys can
[1066.80 - 1069.76] tell everybody about the blood draw
[1068.08 - 1071.36] podcast episode
[1069.76 - 1075.28] maybe share the link or let people know
[1071.36 - 1076.64] it's medically podcasted apple podcast
[1075.28 - 1078.24] because what happens is there's a whole
[1076.64 - 1080.96] bunch of people i hear every day i just
[1078.24 - 1083.20] had 27 vials taken and just had 15 vials
[1080.96 - 1085.04] taken i just had 12 vials taken
[1083.20 - 1086.88] and it's like okay great a big part of
[1085.04 - 1088.32] your immune system was removed
[1086.88 - 1090.16] now you're more susceptible to the
[1088.32 - 1093.20] plague that's happening out there
[1090.16 - 1094.96] one of the reasons why the plague got so
[1093.20 - 1098.72] annoying was because of
[1094.96 - 1100.00] all the blood draws prior that was a big
[1098.72 - 1103.60] reason right there
[1100.00 - 1106.56] all the blood draws prior right
[1103.60 - 1107.12] and people just they were going into the
[1106.56 - 1109.20] plague
[1107.12 - 1111.04] with a weakened immune system just from
[1109.20 - 1112.64] blood testing alone
[1111.04 - 1114.80] just from blood testing alone so i
[1112.64 - 1116.64] peeled some potatoes here took the
[1114.80 - 1118.72] skin off these are steamed by the way
[1116.64 - 1122.64] these are steamed potatoes
[1118.72 - 1124.40] they're not raw steamed potatoes it's
[1122.64 - 1126.08] the only way to cook a potato really
[1124.40 - 1127.76] that's the best way to do it it's having
[1126.08 - 1129.52] a steamed potato so i'm giving you kind
[1127.76 - 1131.52] of the rundown on that right there
[1129.52 - 1133.76] let me mash these up if you guys got a
[1131.52 - 1136.24] second thank you for coming on here lots
[1133.76 - 1138.56] to talk about
[1136.24 - 1139.76] susan gabriel said i recently told a
[1138.56 - 1142.80] technician
[1139.76 - 1143.12] only two have files she said it wouldn't
[1142.80 - 1146.64] be
[1143.12 - 1149.68] enough i said it's plenty she said okay
[1146.64 - 1153.68] you fought for it you fought for it
[1149.68 - 1156.16] you you fought for it you took control
[1153.68 - 1157.52] over your health and you fought for it
[1156.16 - 1160.56] and you won
[1157.52 - 1162.80] you won and it matters it
[1160.56 - 1163.76] matters austin good to see you it
[1162.80 - 1167.52] matters
[1163.76 - 1170.64] it really really does because
[1167.52 - 1173.36] when you get that blood taken
[1170.64 - 1174.88] you lose your immune system you do guess
[1173.36 - 1177.44] where the immune system is
[1174.88 - 1178.08] it's in your bloodstream i love when you
[1177.44 - 1180.00] hear
[1178.08 - 1181.28] the whole thing of the theory of your
[1180.00 - 1183.84] immune system's all in your gut
[1181.28 - 1185.36] it's not all in your gut it's not your
[1183.84 - 1188.32] immune system isn't
[1185.36 - 1188.88] micro biome that's not your immune
[1188.32 - 1190.64] system
[1188.88 - 1192.48] i bet you i'm pissing off somebody right
[1190.64 - 1194.88] now i'm sure because there's so much
[1192.48 - 1196.16] brainwashing and the colts out there
[1194.88 - 1197.84] about you know your immune system being
[1196.16 - 1199.20] all in your gut all in your gut
[1197.84 - 1201.68] everything's in your gut
[1199.20 - 1202.80] all the zelda all the gut products and
[1201.68 - 1206.88] the gut potions
[1202.80 - 1208.48] and the gut powders and the gut tests
[1206.88 - 1209.92] where you do the stool samples and
[1208.48 - 1211.68] you're looking for all the gut
[1209.92 - 1213.68] microbiome issues and everything else
[1211.68 - 1214.96] meanwhile people just don't get better
[1213.68 - 1216.40] they don't get does that fix your
[1214.96 - 1218.16] hashimoto's thyroiditis because i'm
[1216.40 - 1220.72] scratching my head over here
[1218.16 - 1222.00] does that fix a four-year-old's eczema
[1220.72 - 1223.44] that's raging
[1222.00 - 1225.12] and the four-year-old can't even the
[1223.44 - 1226.88] skin's cracking off the four-year-old
[1225.12 - 1230.00] the mom and dad are in
[1226.88 - 1230.72] perils does that fix that i'm just
[1230.00 - 1234.24] curious
[1230.72 - 1236.56] um you know the gut gut health is isn't
[1234.24 - 1238.72] isn't everything for immune system the
[1236.56 - 1240.56] immune system is in your bloodstream and
[1238.72 - 1241.84] i've i've talked to doctors recently
[1240.56 - 1242.96] about this and they said well tell me
[1241.84 - 1245.60] more about this because
[1242.96 - 1247.04] because the the trend is your immune
[1245.60 - 1248.96] system is all in your gut
[1247.04 - 1252.24] yeah there's a lot of immune system
[1248.96 - 1254.24] around the gut for sure but the majority
[1252.24 - 1255.68] is everywhere else in the body it's
[1254.24 - 1256.56] protecting your brain it's in your
[1255.68 - 1257.84] bloodstream
[1256.56 - 1260.40] so your immune system is in your
[1257.84 - 1262.08] bloodstream that's the whole point
[1260.40 - 1263.76] your blood circulating every single
[1262.08 - 1265.28] vessel every single organ in your body
[1263.76 - 1267.12] and it has to have white cells and white
[1265.28 - 1268.64] blood cells in it it has to
[1267.12 - 1270.00] that's how you stop a pathogen from
[1268.64 - 1271.76] going to the brain that's how you stop
[1270.00 - 1272.96] infections that's how you stop sepsis
[1271.76 - 1275.84] that's how you stop
[1272.96 - 1277.20] blood uh poisoning and then you've got
[1275.84 - 1278.64] bacterial infections in the blood and
[1277.20 - 1280.24] then you just die of sepsis in the
[1278.64 - 1282.32] hospital it's because your immune system
[1280.24 - 1284.40] is all in your blood that's the majority
[1282.32 - 1286.48] of it there's a large amount in the gut
[1284.40 - 1288.32] not in the intestinal lining and that's
[1286.48 - 1291.20] the big issue right there so if you want
[1288.32 - 1292.72] details because details matter it's not
[1291.20 - 1294.88] your microorganisms
[1292.72 - 1296.64] that are inside your gut creating your
[1294.88 - 1297.12] immune system it's not good bacteria
[1296.64 - 1299.36] that are
[1297.12 - 1301.04] inside your intestinal inside your
[1299.36 - 1302.00] intestinal tract that doesn't create an
[1301.04 - 1304.24] immune system
[1302.00 - 1306.32] i'm just letting you know good bacteria
[1304.24 - 1309.44] has nothing nothing to do with creating
[1306.32 - 1310.56] immune cells so it's important right to
[1309.44 - 1313.28] know that
[1310.56 - 1314.08] so yes you have you have white blood
[1313.28 - 1316.00] cells
[1314.08 - 1318.24] your immune system is circulating
[1316.00 - 1318.80] throughout every blood vessel around
[1318.24 - 1320.40] your gut
[1318.80 - 1322.16] every blood vessel around every organ
[1320.40 - 1323.84] but it's not inside your intestinal
[1322.16 - 1325.28] tract you guys got to get that part
[1323.84 - 1327.68] straight anyway
[1325.28 - 1329.28] okay you got your you got your lymphatic
[1327.68 - 1331.92] system right your lymphocytes
[1329.28 - 1333.52] so that's another place that that's
[1331.92 - 1335.28] another place right there your lymphatic
[1333.52 - 1336.00] system and it circulates around your
[1335.28 - 1337.84] torso
[1336.00 - 1339.12] most of your lymphatic system is around
[1337.84 - 1340.16] your torso right so you got your
[1339.12 - 1342.16] lymphocytes
[1340.16 - 1343.52] but that's not the lining inside your
[1342.16 - 1345.20] gut
[1343.52 - 1347.12] that's not your good bacteria
[1345.20 - 1349.20] microorganisms inside you god this is so
[1347.12 - 1350.48] important to know details matter
[1349.20 - 1352.32] because here's what's going to happen
[1350.48 - 1353.76] you go to your gut health doctor he's
[1352.32 - 1356.08] going to take 20 vials of blood and
[1353.76 - 1357.36] destroy your immune system
[1356.08 - 1359.12] while he's telling you how your immune
[1357.36 - 1360.48] system is all in your gut
[1359.12 - 1361.84] you don't see the irony that because i'm
[1360.48 - 1364.56] kind of like scratching my head on that
[1361.84 - 1367.84] one i'm like okay um
[1364.56 - 1368.72] okay you went to the you went to the
[1367.84 - 1371.28] doctor
[1368.72 - 1373.52] all right he took 20 vials of blood
[1371.28 - 1375.68] specialists he's a gut health guy too
[1373.52 - 1377.60] functional doctor whoever it is and he
[1375.68 - 1379.36] took you know 18 miles of blood
[1377.60 - 1381.68] he just annihilated your immune system
[1379.36 - 1382.96] for the next three to six months
[1381.68 - 1384.40] killed your red blood cells for the next
[1382.96 - 1385.84] three to six months it takes a long time
[1384.40 - 1387.20] to get these blood cells back it doesn't
[1385.84 - 1389.28] take three days
[1387.20 - 1390.56] and but yet he's telling you
[1389.28 - 1392.24] everything's in your gut so here's some
[1390.56 - 1393.36] gut potions here's some gut powders

[1448.96 - 1451.84] to the doctor
[1450.00 - 1453.44] and then we get eight vials drawn seven
[1451.84 - 1455.28] vowels drawn ten vowels drawn
[1453.44 - 1456.72] and they're removing our immune system

[1705.28 - 1708.84] a book that's gonna blow the roof off
[1707.04 - 1712.32] the universe
[1708.84 - 1716.24] okay i mean seriously it's it's
[1712.32 - 1719.76] it's the book's gonna be
[1716.24 - 1721.04] insane uh and i'm only saying that the
[1719.76 - 1722.48] spirit of compassion is giving me the
[1721.04 - 1723.04] information in my mind is being blown
[1722.48 - 1726.00] every second
[1723.04 - 1727.68] when my mind's being blown i'm like whoa
[1726.00 - 1729.04] so what happens is we get addicted to
[1727.68 - 1730.32] adrenaline that's something
[1729.04 - 1731.92] well first of all let me just go into
[1730.32 - 1734.24] the brain a little bit more just a
[1731.92 - 1737.28] little touch more about the brain
[1734.24 - 1738.64] let me cover that a little bit more
[1737.28 - 1740.00] i'm just making sure these are mashed
[1738.64 - 1741.44] and they look really nice i'm mashing
[1740.00 - 1742.96] some potatoes right here it's a comfort
[1741.44 - 1747.04] food right here for people
[1742.96 - 1749.84] it's great i make it for family
[1747.04 - 1749.84] too sometimes
[1751.04 - 1757.60] so we're told that the brain
[1754.08 - 1761.84] needs fat and it's made out of fat wrong
[1757.60 - 1764.24] right there i'm sorry but it's wrong
[1761.84 - 1765.60] science battles itself constantly by the
[1764.24 - 1767.12] way okay
[1765.60 - 1768.72] you know what science said about
[1767.12 - 1772.08] caffeine
[1768.72 - 1774.08] back in the 80s top science science that
[1772.08 - 1776.08] could never be disputed
[1774.08 - 1777.20] conventional science it could never be
[1776.08 - 1779.20] disputed you know what
[1777.20 - 1782.40] conventional science said in 1980s
[1779.20 - 1783.76] caffeine will cause heart disease
[1782.40 - 1786.72] caffeine will worsen all your
[1783.76 - 1788.88] neurological diseases
[1786.72 - 1790.48] caffeine will cause diabetes make it
[1788.88 - 1793.76] worse and worse
[1790.48 - 1795.52] right so that was the studies that came
[1793.76 - 1797.12] out in the 1980s did you know that
[1795.52 - 1798.88] so the studies that came out in the
[1797.12 - 1802.48] 1980s
[1798.88 - 1804.32] were were straight up about caffeine
[1802.48 - 1807.36] causing all this damage right
[1804.32 - 1809.52] but then the caffeine industry said
[1807.36 - 1811.28] we're gonna do our own studies
[1809.52 - 1812.80] so as the years go by it's like caffeine
[1811.28 - 1815.44] is good for you
[1812.80 - 1816.56] cacao is good for you coffee is good for
[1815.44 - 1818.16] you
[1816.56 - 1819.68] right and so they went against
[1818.16 - 1821.28] conventional science whose science is
[1819.68 - 1823.36] right
[1821.28 - 1824.48] science battles science all the time i'm
[1823.36 - 1825.52] actually going to talk about it on
[1824.48 - 1827.68] instagram later
[1825.52 - 1829.28] if you guys come to me with to instagram
[1827.68 - 1830.48] later
[1829.28 - 1833.28] i think we're going to really kind of
[1830.48 - 1836.64] rip into that a little bit
[1833.28 - 1838.16] you guys are are up for it i got some
[1836.64 - 1839.04] limes i got some lemon sitting right
[1838.16 - 1842.08] here
[1839.04 - 1844.32] i'm gonna use that in this so we get
[1842.08 - 1849.04] addicted to caffeine our adrenals go
[1844.32 - 1852.08] crazy our adrenals go crazy
[1849.04 - 1853.44] right here okay we get addicted to fats
[1852.08 - 1854.56] we fat ourselves with death there's no
[1853.44 - 1856.56] fat in this dish
[1854.56 - 1858.08] i get it you guys eat avocado it's okay
[1856.56 - 1859.76] eat avocado
[1858.08 - 1861.84] you guys eat teeny it's okay those are
[1859.76 - 1863.12] healthier fats right they are
[1861.84 - 1865.36] some of you guys are eating chicken it's
[1863.12 - 1868.72] not the healthiest fat we know that
[1865.36 - 1871.20] right chicken fat clog up the heart
[1868.72 - 1872.48] kill you down the road right i'm not
[1871.20 - 1874.24] saying you can't eat chicken
[1872.48 - 1876.40] the reason why medical medium
[1874.24 - 1877.68] information is pro people who eat animal
[1876.40 - 1880.56] proteins too
[1877.68 - 1882.40] is because chicken isn't going to feed
[1880.56 - 1884.16] all the viruses
[1882.40 - 1885.76] that keep everybody sick so if you're
[1884.16 - 1886.96] somebody that's into chicken yeah you
[1885.76 - 1889.12] can have a little bit but you eat too
[1886.96 - 1891.28] much chicken you can kill yourself
[1889.12 - 1893.04] but i've also seen plant-based people
[1891.28 - 1893.60] kill themselves by eating too many nut
[1893.04 - 1895.28] butters
[1893.60 - 1896.72] and too much fats and too much oils
[1895.28 - 1898.08] they'll kill themselves too
[1896.72 - 1899.12] but get themselves sick down the road
[1898.08 - 1900.40] have a heart attack you don't think
[1899.12 - 1901.28] plant-based people don't have heart
[1900.40 - 1903.28] attacks
[1901.28 - 1905.04] yeah they have heart attacks they eat
[1903.28 - 1906.64] too much fat everybody's eating too much
[1905.04 - 1908.24] fat and then we fat ourselves to death
[1906.64 - 1908.88] and now we're told oh god have fat
[1908.24 - 1911.36] healthy
[1908.88 - 1913.20] much fat as you can your brain needs it
[1911.36 - 1914.08] did you know fat stops glucose from
[1913.20 - 1917.68] getting to your brain
[1914.08 - 1918.00] and your brain dies within 10 seconds of
[1917.68 - 1920.08] not
[1918.00 - 1923.12] getting that glucose i told you guys
[1920.08 - 1923.12] that a couple minutes ago
[1923.36 - 1925.60] so
[1927.12 - 1932.24] i want to finish this a little bit okay
[1930.56 - 1934.40] so when you're doing all the avocado
[1932.24 - 1936.00] nuts and seeds nut butters oils
[1934.40 - 1938.24] right when you're doing all that
[1936.00 - 1940.56] avocados nut butters
[1938.24 - 1942.80] oils right when you're doing all that
[1940.56 - 1945.12] okay
[1942.80 - 1946.88] you're stopping glucose from getting to
[1945.12 - 1949.60] the brain at its maximum
[1946.88 - 1951.20] so it's always like a like a lesser
[1949.60 - 1954.64] amount getting to the brain
[1951.20 - 1956.56] and you get hungry fat makes you want to
[1954.64 - 1958.08] eat more and more fat people say sugar
[1956.56 - 1960.40] makes me want to eat more and more sugar
[1958.08 - 1961.92] oh no that's sugar with fat
[1960.40 - 1963.68] that makes you want to eat more and more
[1961.92 - 1965.28] sugar that's sugar with
[1963.68 - 1969.20] fat that makes you want to eat more and
[1965.28 - 1969.20] more sugar that's what that is okay
[1969.52 - 1974.96] that's important to know got some mashed
[1972.96 - 1977.84] potatoes here i'm going to put some lime
[1974.96 - 1977.84] in here
[1978.64 - 1984.24] mashed potatoes in the pan right
[1982.08 - 1985.76] see if we could squeeze this slime i'm
[1984.24 - 1987.12] having a problem here with this one this
[1985.76 - 1989.04] one's slippery
[1987.12 - 1991.20] potato can be a little slippery when
[1989.04 - 1994.64] it's on your hands
[1991.20 - 1998.00] tik tok the handle not the app
[1994.64 - 2000.96] tick tock the handle says
[1998.00 - 2002.08] seeds so that you're talking about flax
[2000.96 - 2003.84] seeds
[2002.08 - 2006.32] look you can they're healthy they're
[2003.84 - 2007.52] healthy fats flax seeds and avocado if
[2006.32 - 2009.04] you guys are gonna eat fats that's the
[2007.52 - 2011.52] ones to do sesame seeds
[2009.04 - 2013.36] hemp seeds pumpkin seeds those are the
[2011.52 - 2014.40] best ones sunflower seeds are good too
[2013.36 - 2017.60] right
[2014.40 - 2020.24] you can do that but keep in mind if
[2017.60 - 2020.24] you're sick
[2020.32 - 2025.04] too much fat is not going to let you
[2022.88 - 2028.24] heal all the way
[2025.04 - 2028.64] animal protein or plant-based keep that
[2028.24 - 2031.36] in mind
[2028.64 - 2033.28] animal protein or plant-based animal
[2031.36 - 2034.48] protein people are now eating avocados
[2033.28 - 2034.80] and nuts and seeds they didn't used to
[2034.48 - 2038.40] eat
[2034.80 - 2040.96] eat all that but now they do
[2038.40 - 2043.44] and but keep in mind about this this is
[2040.96 - 2043.44] important
[2044.84 - 2049.28] that
[2047.04 - 2050.56] got some mashed potatoes in here a
[2049.28 - 2051.92] little bit i'm gonna put some peas in
[2050.56 - 2053.76] here too
[2051.92 - 2055.04] keep in mind that the more fat you dump
[2053.76 - 2057.12] in your system
[2055.04 - 2059.12] the less glucose gets to the brain so
[2057.12 - 2061.84] you're gonna have eating
[2059.12 - 2063.12] like eating issues you're gonna be like
[2061.84 - 2065.68] i'm hungry
[2063.12 - 2067.68] all the time that's your brain saying
[2065.68 - 2069.36] i'm hungry because you're not letting me
[2067.68 - 2071.28] get enough glucose
[2069.36 - 2072.64] you're not giving me three mangoes when
[2071.28 - 2074.32] i need in the morning you're not giving
[2072.64 - 2076.32] me the heavy metal detox smoothie with
[2074.32 - 2077.92] the glucose with the bananas
[2076.32 - 2080.08] you're you know in the industry wants
[2077.92 - 2081.60] you afraid of bananas be open-hearted
[2080.08 - 2084.24] good to see you
[2081.60 - 2084.64] the industry wants you afraid of bananas
[2084.24 - 2086.32] right
[2084.64 - 2088.08] the industry wants you afraid of that
[2086.32 - 2090.64] they want you they don't want you eating
[2088.08 - 2090.64] bananas
[2090.88 - 2095.84] they don't watch eating bananas no way
[2093.60 - 2098.24] can add a little bit more water to this
[2095.84 - 2099.60] that's what i'm gonna do the industry
[2098.24 - 2101.04] doesn't want you having bananas they
[2099.60 - 2102.32] think it's too much sugar
[2101.04 - 2104.40] so what's going to happen is you're
[2102.32 - 2106.72] going to be on fat fat fat
[2104.40 - 2108.72] and then you're eventually going to eat
[2106.72 - 2110.00] the bad sugar is what you're going to do
[2108.72 - 2114.48] you're going to have the bad
[2110.00 - 2114.48] sugars what's going to happen so
[2115.04 - 2118.24] adding a little touch of water to the
[2116.64 - 2118.80] mashed potatoes which will eventually
[2118.24 - 2120.72] dry up
[2118.80 - 2121.84] but you need it when you're putting in
[2120.72 - 2124.40] some peas
[2121.84 - 2126.32] and that's a thing there too so i'm
[2124.40 - 2129.20] going to pop in some peas into this
[2126.32 - 2131.84] pan's going to get nice and hot there we
[2129.20 - 2131.84] go
[2132.40 - 2135.84] you have to add a little bit of moisture
[2133.92 - 2138.08] into the pan or you get a hash brown
[2135.84 - 2139.44] a hash brown pancake so that's what
[2138.08 - 2142.00] you'll get
[2139.44 - 2143.84] ashley kevin good to see you i said no
[2142.00 - 2144.72] no it's so nice to see you too as well
[2143.84 - 2147.52] okay
[2144.72 - 2148.32] so we're gonna make some mashed potatoes
[2147.52 - 2150.40] like we're doing
[2148.32 - 2152.00] i have some lettuce here too i just put
[2150.40 - 2153.76] some lime in there i'm gonna pop some
[2152.00 - 2156.32] lemon in a little bit as well
[2153.76 - 2158.16] it's a basic dish so what happens is if
[2156.32 - 2160.00] you're not getting critical critical
[2158.16 - 2161.84] needed nutrients to the brain
[2160.00 - 2163.20] on a regular basis the brain will go
[2161.84 - 2164.64] deficient and if your brain goes
[2163.20 - 2165.76] deficient of glucose if it goes
[2164.64 - 2169.12] deficient because
[2165.76 - 2173.44] we're eating too much fat fat
[2169.12 - 2176.88] blocks sugar from entering brain cells
[2173.44 - 2177.44] but the survival of life allows some to
[2176.88 - 2180.20] enter
[2177.44 - 2181.60] some to enter but we go into a
[2180.20 - 2184.80] deficiency
[2181.60 - 2186.40] is what we do that deficiency makes us
[2184.80 - 2190.00] now hungry and then
[2186.40 - 2191.76] we're doing more fat or bad sugar with
[2190.00 - 2193.60] fat because their body's like why am i
[2191.76 - 2195.36] sugar craving but yet you're eating fat
[2193.60 - 2196.56] with sugar why am i sugar craving but
[2195.36 - 2198.24] you're eating fat with sugar
[2196.56 - 2200.00] you're still blocking the glucose from
[2198.24 - 2202.48] getting to the brain
[2200.00 - 2204.32] is what you're doing see how it works
[2202.48 - 2206.56] that's how it works
[2204.32 - 2207.52] tom posky says do carnival peep
[2206.56 - 2210.16] carnivore
[2207.52 - 2210.72] people survive because of sugar in the
[2210.16 - 2213.20] meat
[2210.72 - 2214.48] it's how they survive sugar in the meat
[2213.20 - 2218.00] it's not enough
[2214.48 - 2220.64] it's not enough it's not enough because
[2218.00 - 2222.88] because you got fat in the meat too but
[2220.64 - 2225.44] you survive on carnivore
[2222.88 - 2226.32] you can you can survive on carnivore
[2225.44 - 2229.44] because
[2226.32 - 2231.04] the the sugar meats meats meat has sugar
[2229.44 - 2232.80] in it i love when people say well i'm on
[2231.04 - 2234.80] a sugar-free diet i'm eating just meat
[2232.80 - 2237.28] i'm like that's funny
[2234.80 - 2238.80] because the cow had a lot of sugar in
[2237.28 - 2241.84] its blood
[2238.80 - 2244.72] and that red meat is all sugar and
[2241.84 - 2244.72] that's what that is
[2244.80 - 2248.32] sugar and eggs or sugar you know why
[2246.96 - 2250.24] there's a lot of sugar in eggs
[2248.32 - 2251.60] you guys know that eggs are sweet when
[2250.24 - 2253.20] you have an egg they're sweet did you
[2251.60 - 2254.80] know cheese is sweet too
[2253.20 - 2257.68] let's cover the egg the egg's an
[2254.80 - 2261.44] important one as far as like sweetness
[2257.68 - 2265.52] okay when you have
[2261.44 - 2268.56] an egg you'll notice it's kind of sweet
[2265.52 - 2269.52] right it is there's a reason why it's
[2268.56 - 2272.40] sweet
[2269.52 - 2272.96] it's sweet because glucose is how the
[2272.40 - 2277.12] chicken
[2272.96 - 2280.24] the chick can actually start to become
[2277.12 - 2282.84] a chicken like grow develop
[2280.24 - 2284.00] glucose is critical you don't have
[2282.84 - 2286.80] glucose
[2284.00 - 2287.28] ain't gonna be a baby chick listen to
[2286.80 - 2288.96] the bo
[2287.28 - 2290.88] the podcast episode medical being
[2288.96 - 2292.00] podcasted apple podcast i'm juggling a
[2290.88 - 2294.40] lot of things here you guys

[2294.40 - 2297.92] fruit fear episode two if you're afraid
[2296.08 - 2299.36] of bananas if you'd be you know if
[2297.92 - 2301.20] you're lost in the world of fat and
[2299.36 - 2304.32] protein
[2301.20 - 2306.04] this is an anti-animal protein uh talk
[2304.32 - 2307.44] we're doing right now this is an
[2306.04 - 2310.64] anti-plant-based
[2307.44 - 2312.48] vegetarian vegan talk it's not it at all
[2310.64 - 2314.08] you can fat yourself to death as a vegan
[2312.48 - 2315.44] and a plant-based person
[2314.08 - 2317.04] you can still get a heart attack down
[2315.44 - 2317.84] the road you can still stay sick and not
[2317.04 - 2319.76] heal
[2317.84 - 2321.44] you can still just you can easily fat
[2319.76 - 2322.40] yourself to death you can salt yourself
[2321.44 - 2324.88] to death
[2322.40 - 2327.20] you can you can do a lot of things that
[2324.88 - 2330.56] aren't good
[2327.20 - 2334.08] and here's the deal right
[2330.56 - 2335.52] the details matter if someone's stuck in
[2334.08 - 2337.04] this vicious cycle and they're just in
[2335.52 - 2339.04] this vicious cycle vicious cycle they
[2337.04 - 2340.72] can't break out of it they're overeating
[2339.04 - 2342.24] they don't feel good they're overeating
[2340.72 - 2344.08] they're told to eat you know healthier
[2342.24 - 2345.52] fats they're eating more of that too
[2344.08 - 2348.80] but they don't know how to break from
[2345.52 - 2348.80] this they don't know how to recover
[2349.68 - 2353.84] all these little pieces of information
[2351.84 - 2355.84] and critical needed details all matter
[2353.84 - 2359.28] right now that we're talking about
[2355.84 - 2361.44] okay so what i like to do
[2359.28 - 2362.88] right by the way you guys medical

[2386.40 - 2390.24] i'm just giving you guys a 4-1-1 that's
[2388.40 - 2391.84] the goal right there
[2390.24 - 2393.92] the more stress you're under the more
[2391.84 - 2394.64] glucose you need not the more fat you
[2393.92 - 2396.40] need
[2394.64 - 2398.40] the more stress you're under the more
[2396.40 - 2401.28] sugar you need for your brain
[2398.40 - 2401.84] but we end up craving pizza so we crave
[2401.28 - 2404.64] the bad
[2401.84 - 2405.92] sugar we end up creating ice cream so we
[2404.64 - 2409.44] crave the bad sugar
[2405.92 - 2412.48] we end up craving uh spaghetti
[2409.44 - 2414.40] because because we we you know but
[2412.48 - 2415.04] there's fat on everything with this
[2414.40 - 2417.76] sugar
[2415.04 - 2419.20] your pizza is fat and sugar so the sugar
[2417.76 - 2420.48] never gets to the brain
[2419.20 - 2422.72] mashed potatoes are coming out really
[2420.48 - 2424.72] nice right now
[2422.72 - 2426.96] so the sugar the glucose never gets to
[2424.72 - 2427.36] your brain because you're doing too much
[2426.96 - 2429.20] fat
[2427.36 - 2430.72] but we end up craving the pizza again
[2429.20 - 2432.08] and then again and again and we eat
[2430.72 - 2433.68] ourselves sick and then we crave it
[2432.08 - 2436.88] again and we eat ourselves sick
[2433.68 - 2438.24] then it's nachos night then we're doing
[2436.88 - 2440.24] nachos
[2438.24 - 2441.84] because we're craving all that cheese
[2440.24 - 2443.68] and that corn chip
[2441.84 - 2445.28] we're creating nachos we're creating
[2443.68 - 2447.20] we're craving that
[2445.28 - 2449.36] that corn chip and the cheese then we're
[2447.20 - 2452.88] craving tacos because we're craving that
[2449.36 - 2453.84] cheese on top of your corn corn tortilla
[2452.88 - 2456.56] your corn shell

[2465.04 - 2467.92] and then it keeps your adrenaline
[2466.64 - 2468.80] pumping because your adrenaline's like
[2467.92 - 2470.32] holy crap
[2468.80 - 2471.84] you're gonna kill us you're putting so
[2470.32 - 2473.28] much fat in your system you're gonna
[2471.84 - 2474.00] kill our heart that's what you're gonna
[2473.28 - 2475.76] do
[2474.00 - 2477.28] you're you're gonna you're gonna destroy
[2475.76 - 2479.20] our hearts
[2477.28 - 2481.20] that's what you're doing i got a heart
[2479.20 - 2483.20] right here
[2481.20 - 2484.32] you keep on doing the pizzas you keep on
[2483.20 - 2486.24] doing the ice cream
[2484.32 - 2488.16] you got so much fat going on here that
[2486.24 - 2490.00] your adrenals are now pumping
[2488.16 - 2491.44] 24 7. there's your adrenals you're
[2490.00 - 2493.36] pumping 24 7.
[2491.44 - 2495.20] thin out the blood thin out the blood
[2493.36 - 2496.72] that person's killing themselves
[2495.20 - 2498.72] we gotta thin out the blood because the
[2496.72 - 2500.80] heart can't pump through all that fat
[2498.72 - 2503.60] the heart can't do it right austin like
[2500.80 - 2506.40] the heart can't pump all that fat

[2529.92 - 2533.28] to release all this adrenaline and now
[2531.52 - 2534.16] you're addicted to fat and adrenaline
[2533.28 - 2537.20] all of the same
[2534.16 - 2540.32] mix you can't break it
[2537.20 - 2543.52] fat high is real maggie portola says

[2565.04 - 2570.16] on how to get yourself to eat more of
[2567.12 - 2573.52] the healing foods
[2570.16 - 2573.52] when you don't enjoy them
[2575.12 - 2579.36] you got to bring in the fruit because
[2577.12 - 2580.48] fruit is satisfying in many ways because
[2579.36 - 2582.56] it's so sweet
[2580.48 - 2584.16] it's actually not really that sweet when
[2582.56 - 2586.24] you think about it a banana doesn't have
[2584.16 - 2587.92] that much sugar in it but it's but still
[2586.24 - 2589.84] it's sweet
[2587.92 - 2592.96] sweetness counts when it comes down to
[2589.84 - 2595.68] that papayas mangoes do some watermelon
[2592.96 - 2597.20] watermelon you guys i hope you're
[2595.68 - 2598.72] starting up the watermelons you do that

[2598.72 - 2602.00] great time to do it so i got some peas
[2600.64 - 2607.84] in here i'm gonna put a little lemon in
[2602.00 - 2607.84] here too this is coming out really good
[2609.76 - 2613.04] you got to get some fruit in there and
[2611.44 - 2613.84] you got to get some mineral salts in
[2613.04 - 2616.24] there
[2613.84 - 2618.80] trace mineral salts the celery juice
[2616.24 - 2621.92] takes time to learn how to love
[2618.80 - 2623.92] the the celery juice for a lot of people
[2621.92 - 2625.84] you know it doesn't seem like it's fun
[2623.92 - 2629.28] to eat
[2625.84 - 2631.14] drink it's fun to drink so i got some
[2629.28 - 2633.28] peas in here i'm gonna get these
[2631.14 - 2636.32] [Music]
[2633.28 - 2637.76] cooking got some mashed potato some
[2636.32 - 2639.52] beautiful piece in here if you guys can
[2637.76 - 2641.20] see that right there you guys see
[2639.52 - 2642.80] it's right there this is a comfort food
[2641.20 - 2643.44] if you want to put sea salt in there
[2642.80 - 2644.72] because you
[2643.44 - 2645.92] again a lot of people are going to eat
[2644.72 - 2647.44] salt every day it doesn't matter what
[2645.92 - 2648.72] medical medium says doesn't matter if
[2647.44 - 2649.92] medical medium says be careful about
[2648.72 - 2650.32] your salt so you're going to eat it so
[2649.92 - 2651.84] just
[2650.32 - 2653.68] put some sea salt in there if it's going
[2651.84 - 2654.72] to do could put some black pepper in
[2653.68 - 2656.80] there if you really want
[2654.72 - 2658.08] you can do that cayenne pepper is a
[2656.80 - 2659.92] great one for here too
[2658.08 - 2661.28] putting cayenne pepper in here onion
[2659.92 - 2665.20] powder is a great one
[2661.28 - 2666.96] you can really make this taste so good
[2665.20 - 2668.48] taste buds change over time when you
[2666.96 - 2669.36] incorporate pieces in we need some
[2668.48 - 2670.96] willpower too
[2669.36 - 2672.96] takes a little time to get the willpower
[2670.96 - 2676.24] going where
[2672.96 - 2678.24] taste buds change they develop
[2676.24 - 2680.24] you end up liking those mangoes you end
[2678.24 - 2681.28] up liking those grapes cherries apples
[2680.24 - 2684.72] bananas
[2681.28 - 2687.36] peaches plums nectarines melons
[2684.72 - 2689.04] honeydew melons crenshaw melons
[2687.36 - 2691.84] watermelons
[2689.04 - 2691.84] need i say more
[2692.88 - 2698.40] but we're taught we're taught to keep
[2695.36 - 2700.88] our addictions around did you know that
[2698.40 - 2702.88] we're taught that if you want to lose
[2700.88 - 2704.96] weight you better just stop eating
[2702.88 - 2706.96] and you better get on caffeine and then
[2704.96 - 2708.16] now you're on caffeine all day long and
[2706.96 - 2709.76] you stopped eating and now you're eating
[2708.16 - 2711.76] your one meal a day at the end of the
[2709.76 - 2713.52] day that ain't gonna last long
[2711.76 - 2715.60] you'll burn those adrenals out they'll
[2713.52 - 2717.36] come crashing down down the road
[2715.60 - 2718.96] all kinds of problems will happen you'll
[2717.36 - 2720.16] age fast because you're running on
[2718.96 - 2723.76] caffeine all the time
[2720.16 - 2724.64] your adrenals will they will not forgive
[2723.76 - 2727.84] you
[2724.64 - 2729.76] when you caffeine them to crazy land
[2727.84 - 2731.60] when you caffeine your adrenals to crazy
[2729.76 - 2732.40] land when you caffeine the heck out of
[2731.60 - 2735.52] them
[2732.40 - 2737.12] over the years then when you do eat
[2735.52 - 2740.56] you're dumping in all that fat whether
[2737.12 - 2740.56] it's plant-based or animal-based
[2744.00 - 2747.20] you know spirit of compassion is the
[2745.52 - 2752.00] voice of reason not me
[2747.20 - 2752.00] i'm just i'm just delivering the message
[2755.04 - 2758.96] adrenals are working hard anyway you're
[2757.04 - 2762.16] up against a little bit of stress
[2758.96 - 2764.08] you had a breakup maybe you're falling
[2762.16 - 2766.72] out with a friendship
[2764.08 - 2767.28] maybe a business partner maybe a family
[2766.72 - 2770.32] member
[2767.28 - 2771.76] maybe a sibling some stress there our
[2770.32 - 2774.40] adrenals are already
[2771.76 - 2776.16] under stress were you driving on the
[2774.40 - 2777.68] road and had a little accident boom your
[2776.16 - 2778.72] adrenals are running for a day and a
[2777.68 - 2781.12] night
[2778.72 - 2782.72] we already have adrenals pumping all the
[2781.12 - 2784.24] time we already get little bits of fight
[2782.72 - 2785.76] or flight all the time they're working
[2784.24 - 2787.36] overtime so all of a sudden let's just
[2785.76 - 2789.52] dump a whole bunch of caffeine in there
[2787.36 - 2791.36] and just blow them the out
[2789.52 - 2794.72] just blow those adrenals out just
[2791.36 - 2796.24] annihilate them let's just do that
[2794.72 - 2798.72] now make sure let's just do a lot of
[2796.24 - 2801.04] high fat too and soak up that adrenaline
[2798.72 - 2803.60] and then get it you know addicted with
[2801.04 - 2805.28] adrenaline get dictated with the fat
[2803.60 - 2806.64] let's make sure we do lots of chocolate
[2805.28 - 2808.48] too
[2806.64 - 2809.76] let's go into our happy place and tank a
[2808.48 - 2812.08] bunch of chocolate
[2809.76 - 2813.76] i get it i get it life is hard but we
[2812.08 - 2814.64] have to do some things to take care of
[2813.76 - 2817.44] ourselves too
[2814.64 - 2819.44] we got to do some celery juice dr fon
[2817.44 - 2822.72] might as well face it we're addicted
[2819.44 - 2825.76] i get it so you dump
[2822.72 - 2827.92] all the fat in your adrenals are pumping
[2825.76 - 2830.72] to thin it out to try to save your life
[2827.92 - 2832.08] every day your heart is trying to pump
[2830.72 - 2833.36] your blood and it's really
[2832.08 - 2835.04] thick and it's trying to pump it pump
[2833.36 - 2835.92] and pump and pump it but there's so much
[2835.04 - 2838.56] fat in the blood
[2835.92 - 2839.12] that's hard to pump it and then adrenal
[2838.56 - 2840.80] drainage
[2839.12 - 2842.24] adrenals have to release more adrenaline
[2840.80 - 2843.04] to thin out that blood and thin out that
[2842.24 - 2846.16] blood
[2843.04 - 2847.60] and then all to try to get glucose to
[2846.16 - 2849.28] your brain
[2847.60 - 2851.20] always try to get some glucose here
[2849.28 - 2852.56] because guess what in five
[2851.20 - 2858.56] seconds if the brain doesn't have
[2852.56 - 2862.00] glucose it starts its journey of death
[2858.56 - 2863.44] in 10 seconds it can die 10 seconds
[2862.00 - 2864.24] without glucose your brain can start
[2863.44 - 2866.16] dying
[2864.24 - 2868.96] tissue when your brain starts dying
[2866.16 - 2873.84] without glucose 10 seconds
[2868.96 - 2873.84] 10 seconds
[2878.08 - 2884.96] yep yep
[2881.20 - 2887.60] less than that 10 seconds is just
[2884.96 - 2889.12] starts with that lesson so we're taught
[2887.60 - 2890.40] to be high chasers are you guys high
[2889.12 - 2893.60] chasers
[2890.40 - 2895.44] right i got some peas in here they're
[2893.60 - 2897.12] they're i put frozen peas in here such a
[2895.44 - 2898.24] simple dish frozen peas come on we're
[2897.12 - 2901.44] getting frozen peas
[2898.24 - 2902.56] alex lange aw sometimes i feel better
[2901.44 - 2905.28] when i eat fat
[2902.56 - 2906.96] like avocados or seeds sometimes i feel
[2905.28 - 2910.48] worse
[2906.96 - 2914.16] alex good to see you honored you're here
[2910.48 - 2917.36] what happens is when we eat fat
[2914.16 - 2918.56] we get the adrenaline surge we get the
[2917.36 - 2920.48] adrenaline surge
[2918.56 - 2921.84] because the adrenaline has to thin out
[2920.48 - 2922.88] thin out the fat it has to thin the
[2921.84 - 2925.04] viscosity to level us
[2922.88 - 2926.80] break it down the consistency has to
[2925.04 - 2930.56] break that fat consistency down
[2926.80 - 2930.56] that's what happens um
[2930.72 - 2934.32] you know basically
[2934.72 - 2942.56] so you need gasoline
[2938.72 - 2943.84] to break down that butter
[2942.56 - 2945.76] i'm not telling you eat gasoline that's
[2943.84 - 2948.72] not at all what i'm saying is your
[2945.76 - 2951.76] adrenaline acts like gasoline
[2948.72 - 2952.72] to break up that butter you drop down
[2951.76 - 2954.16] some bread and butter
[2952.72 - 2955.68] you eat a stick of butter you have
[2954.16 - 2956.00] butter in a dish you got butter in your
[2955.68 - 2957.28] pan
[2956.00 - 2959.20] you got i don't care how wholesome the
[2957.28 - 2960.16] butter is i don't care i don't care if
[2959.20 - 2963.20] you went out there
[2960.16 - 2965.52] and milked the cow and churns your own
[2963.20 - 2965.52] butter
[2967.12 - 2971.04] it's still going to be filling up your
[2968.96 - 2971.44] bloodstream so that your adrenals have
[2971.04 - 2973.84] to
[2971.44 - 2975.84] thin it out it has to thin it out
[2973.84 - 2976.88] because when you have too much fat in
[2975.84 - 2978.56] your bloodstream
[2976.88 - 2980.16] too much fat in your bloodstream you
[2978.56 - 2981.20] can't get all the glucose you need to
[2980.16 - 2986.00] the brain so you go
[2981.20 - 2990.24] you go you go 50 glucose to the brain
[2986.00 - 2990.24] now you're 30 glucose to the brain
[2992.56 - 3000.64] now you're less
[2998.32 - 3003.28] i get it again medical medium the
[3000.64 - 3006.24] medical medium channels
[3003.28 - 3007.36] they're not so fun because it's when you
[3006.24 - 3008.64] go when you go and you're looking at
[3007.36 - 3010.24] other stuff it's like oh that makes
[3008.64 - 3012.00] sense the immune system's all in your
[3010.24 - 3013.92] microbiome no it's not but it make
[3012.00 - 3015.76] it just it seems like a happy place wait
[3013.92 - 3017.28] a minute i need lots of fats because i
[3015.76 - 3019.28] need fats for my brain
[3017.28 - 3021.04] that's great caffeine is actually good
[3019.28 - 3022.08] for me i should do some matcha tea and
[3021.04 - 3024.08] everything because i'm tall
[3022.08 - 3025.68] it's good for me i can have some vinegar
[3024.08 - 3026.00] on everything i eat because apple cider
[3025.68 - 3028.48] vinegar
[3026.00 - 3029.84] is good for me it's like it's endless
[3028.48 - 3031.84] it's endless
[3029.84 - 3033.76] misinformation to put everybody in kind
[3031.84 - 3035.36] of a happy station of health so hey
[3033.76 - 3036.88] i'm doing healthy foods i'm doing and
[3035.36 - 3040.00] then when you get sick
[3036.88 - 3041.76] you're totally effed over totally
[3040.00 - 3043.28] by all the people that actually was just
[3041.76 - 3044.72] like giving you all that that meaning
[3043.28 - 3046.72] like the people at the top giving you
[3044.72 - 3048.40] all that information that's wrong
[3046.72 - 3050.24] people die of strokes and heart attacks
[3048.40 - 3052.16] all the time at all ages whether a
[3050.24 - 3054.00] plant-based vegan vegetarian alike
[3052.16 - 3056.96] pescetarian i don't know come up with
[3054.00 - 3057.84] something else right animal protein keto
[3056.96 - 3060.48] carnivore
[3057.84 - 3062.40] carnivore i i i worry about carnivore
[3060.48 - 3065.12] the carnivore diet for people
[3062.40 - 3067.20] i worry about people with it because
[3065.12 - 3069.68] carnivore diets the atkins diet and it
[3067.20 - 3073.12] and it really killed a lot of people
[3069.68 - 3073.12] um that's what i was told
[3073.52 - 3081.12] you know the it's just i was told that
[3078.00 - 3082.32] by a lot of doctors this is looking good
[3081.12 - 3085.52] here
[3082.32 - 3086.72] over the years that they saw a decline
[3085.52 - 3088.32] in their patients with done
[3086.72 - 3090.00] unlike the atkins diet i was told that
[3088.32 - 3092.96] all the time so this is done i'm going
[3090.00 - 3092.96] to put this in a bowl
[3095.20 - 3099.28] the carnivore diet's the same thing it's
[3097.12 - 3100.72] just a remake of it
[3099.28 - 3103.60] you know reason why people feel a little
[3100.72 - 3106.32] bit better they feel a little bit better
[3103.60 - 3107.84] um this is a real comfort for sure but
[3106.32 - 3108.96] here's the thing the butter's not in
[3107.84 - 3111.68] here
[3108.96 - 3112.88] okay the butter's not in here now if
[3111.68 - 3114.24] you're gonna be someone and you're gonna
[3112.88 - 3115.44] eat that anyway and i'm not gonna be
[3114.24 - 3117.36] able to stop you from eating it every
[3115.44 - 3118.72] day three times a day right i'm like i'm
[3117.36 - 3120.08] just telling you maybe bring it down
[3118.72 - 3122.32] right i'm not trying to say i'm just
[3120.08 - 3124.16] trying to punish you guys
[3122.32 - 3126.08] be the food police or something that's
[3124.16 - 3127.52] not it i'm just saying if you're sick
[3126.08 - 3128.80] and you've got symptoms you've got aches
[3127.52 - 3130.32] and pains you've got chronic fatigue

[3135.04 - 3139.28] whatever whatever is going on lower the
[3138.16 - 3140.80] fats
[3139.28 - 3141.92] yeah you need other tools too you need
[3140.80 - 3143.28] your cellar juice you need your heavy
[3141.92 - 3144.80] metal detox smoothies
[3143.28 - 3146.88] you need your supplement protocols you
[3144.80 - 3148.48] need to know how to take the b12 like
[3146.88 - 3150.16] people are afraid to take b12 because
[3148.48 - 3151.52] like well my b12 registered pretty good
[3150.16 - 3152.96] on my blood test well
[3151.52 - 3154.72] i talk to doctors all the time and i'm
[3152.96 - 3156.16] like well what is your brain
[3154.72 - 3157.60] what blood tests determine what what
[3156.16 - 3158.64] kind of b12 is actually in your brain
[3157.60 - 3159.84] there's no blood test that could
[3158.64 - 3161.20] determine that
[3159.84 - 3162.96] did they stick a needle inside your
[3161.20 - 3164.24] skull right into your brain draw it out
[3162.96 - 3167.04] and be like yeah your brain
[3164.24 - 3168.40] brain has plenty of b12 nobody knows
[3167.04 - 3169.84] nobody knows how the central nervous
[3168.40 - 3170.96] system works out there but what i get
[3169.84 - 3172.24] from spirit of the compassion is you've
[3170.96 - 3173.84] got to have your b12
[3172.24 - 3175.44] that's got to be the right one of course
[3173.84 - 3179.12] that's the vimergy by the way i'm not
[3175.44 - 3181.84] sponsored but that's the vimergy b12
[3179.12 - 3181.84] so
[3185.60 - 3188.80] i'm just saying that a lot of people are
[3187.20 - 3190.48] taught a lot of bad habits and we're not
[3188.80 - 3191.84] taught anything from the start that's
[3190.48 - 3194.16] that we're not taught
[3191.84 - 3195.20] how to eat right from the start that's
[3194.16 - 3197.20] the whole thing
[3195.20 - 3198.88] you know what's funny if you were taught
[3197.20 - 3202.48] how to eat right from the start
[3198.88 - 3204.48] okay if you were taught how to eat right
[3202.48 - 3207.68] from the very beginning
[3204.48 - 3209.12] all right you guys you would
[3207.68 - 3210.96] you would there'd be a whole different
[3209.12 - 3212.32] game going on
[3210.96 - 3213.68] whole different game going on so if
[3212.32 - 3214.96] everybody was throwing the cheeseburger
[3213.68 - 3216.08] if you were taught how to eat right
[3214.96 - 3218.16] right from the start
[3216.08 - 3220.64] for years like everything the
[3218.16 - 3222.16] institutions taught us how to eat right
[3220.64 - 3223.36] medical science and research taught us
[3222.16 - 3224.88] how to eat right which they don't
[3223.36 - 3226.80] obviously right
[3224.88 - 3228.24] institutions taught us how to eat right
[3226.80 - 3228.88] school systems taught us how to eat
[3228.24 - 3230.40] right
[3228.88 - 3232.64] our families taught us how to eat right
[3230.40 - 3234.40] because of that being passed down right
[3232.64 - 3236.72] if we all knew if we all knew how to
[3234.40 - 3238.00] take care of ourselves
[3236.72 - 3239.52] well a couple things would go wrong
[3238.00 - 3241.20] terribly the medical industry would just
[3239.52 - 3243.04] collapse so they can't have that they
[3241.20 - 3244.80] need you to eat wrong
[3243.04 - 3246.24] you know and i never did i ever tell you
[3244.80 - 3247.60] guys
[3246.24 - 3249.04] there's a whole bunch of plants in
[3247.60 - 3250.00] alternate medicine you know what plants
[3249.04 - 3253.28] are
[3250.00 - 3255.76] no plants are there experts
[3253.28 - 3256.64] planted in alternative medicine by
[3255.76 - 3258.16] conventional
[3256.64 - 3260.88] the conventional industry the medical
[3258.16 - 3264.40] industry to try to keep on
[3260.88 - 3267.04] feeding people the bad trends and and
[3264.40 - 3271.04] ingraining it in everybody
[3267.04 - 3273.76] so that you stay sick so there's molds
[3271.04 - 3275.12] and plants all in the industry
[3273.76 - 3276.48] alternative industry you guys don't even
[3275.12 - 3278.48] know it
[3276.48 - 3279.68] the friendliest faces you guys have no
[3278.48 - 3281.36] idea
[3279.68 - 3283.44] and they they were given money they were
[3281.36 - 3284.00] given deals deals were made contracts
[3283.44 - 3286.32] were signed
[3284.00 - 3287.92] and they were put out there to make sure
[3286.32 - 3289.92] that you hear the same old crap
[3287.92 - 3291.36] your brain needs lots of fat that's a
[3289.92 - 3292.00] great way to make sure your alzheimer's
[3291.36 - 3294.64] gets so much
