[70.56 - 74.72] medical medium in the books oh wow so
[73.36 - 76.08] why did she introduce you to it were you
[74.72 - 78.80] dealing with some health issues at the
[76.08 - 80.40] time she was she was telling me about
[78.80 - 82.24] her friend and then she was telling me
[80.40 - 83.48] about certain things that her friends
[82.24 - 84.84] were going through and I'm like well you
[83.48 - 87.32] know what I got to look into this I
[84.84 - 89.76] ordered the book off Amazon I started to
[87.32 - 92.20] follow the medical medium on Instagram
[89.76 - 94.28] and and I'll tell you within a week I
[92.20 - 95.92] saw the difference of the celery juice
[94.28 - 98.92] and the heavy detox
[95.92 - 100.84] metal smoothie that like I make and then
[98.92 - 103.04] they started having it at Air1 it was
[100.84 - 105.12] like wow this is fabulous I'm just I'm
[103.04 - 107.28] so grateful I am so grateful cuz I've
[105.12 - 108.76] seen changes in my life would you like
[107.28 - 110.04] to talk about some of those changes
[108.76 - 112.12] maybe some of the symptoms and
[110.04 - 115.28] conditions that you've healed so far
[112.12 - 118.44] well I used to break out with acne with
[115.28 - 120.48] blemishes and I was living with that for
[118.44 - 121.68] the past 15 years
[120.48 - 123.36] and I couldn't get rid of it I thought
[121.68 - 126.52] it was the coffee I thought it was the
[123.36 - 128.76] foods I was eating and the celery juice
[126.52 - 130.24] within a week I'm not kidding people
[128.76 - 131.84] were looking at me your face is all
[130.24 - 133.40] glowing and I wasn't even and I wasn't
[131.84 - 135.08] even wearing makeup walking into the
[133.40 - 136.52] office and people would be like what do
[135.08 - 139.36] you you people thought I was a lot
[136.52 - 142.48] younger than my age so I'm so grateful
[139.36 - 145.48] because I did see the change in my skin
[142.48 - 149.08] and I felt healthier and on top of that
[145.48 - 150.92] no more coffee and when you drink coffee
[149.08 - 152.92] if you don't take coffee for a day or
[150.92 - 155.44] two you start to feel the headaches no
[152.92 - 157.64] more headaches and I don't even crave it
[155.44 - 159.00] anymore I don't even want to go to the I
[157.64 - 161.96] don't even want to mention the name the
[159.00 - 164.76] s store anymore but it really I don't
[161.96 - 167.20] even crave the coffee anymore and also I
[164.76 - 170.12] noticed that when I started to drink the
[167.20 - 171.84] heavy detox smoothie my fatigue was gone
[170.12 - 173.72] and it was something that I was living
[171.84 - 175.84] with for the past couple of years now
[173.72 - 179.00] and it got worse in the middle of the
[175.84 - 181.72] day I would be sleepy and I took the
[179.00 - 183.76] detox smooth and I started to really see
[181.72 - 187.04] the changes I'm not fatigued anymore I
[183.76 - 189.08] have so much energy and I there are
[187.04 - 191.08] times it's like 1:00 in the morning I am
[189.08 - 193.76] I don't even want to go to bed because
[191.08 - 196.00] of all of the drinks that I've changed
[193.76 - 198.76] the foods that I have started to eat
[196.00 - 201.32] that I've changed has really helped my
[198.76 - 203.48] energy level wow that's incredible do
[201.32 - 205.44] you think having these mail options on
[203.48 - 207.16] the menu at Cafe Gratitude will help
[205.44 - 209.88] your healing Journey will make it easier
[207.16 - 212.00] and more enjoyable definitely cuz I come

[359.08 - 364.52] about this collaboration that you are so
[360.84 - 366.16] excited for the food is amazing I just
[364.52 - 367.92] made an Instagram about it because to
[366.16 - 370.88] come out here and to not have to cook
[367.92 - 373.00] and many of us even for me for work I
[370.88 - 375.40] have to go meet clients sometimes and
[373.00 - 377.20] not eat because I know there's going to
[375.40 - 379.20] be something hidden in the food I'll
[377.20 - 381.40] have intestinal upset from it or
[379.20 - 383.72] whatever it may be to come here and not
[381.40 - 386.16] have to cook a meal when usually you're
[383.72 - 388.28] cooking three meals for yourself a day
[386.16 - 390.52] is just amazing and then to be around
[388.28 - 392.64] such beautiful souls I saw one of your
[390.52 - 395.08] interviews yesterday with the gorgeous
[392.64 - 398.44] couple that was so sweet and touching
[395.08 - 400.60] and it's like people don't always get
[398.44 - 402.44] we're different you know we have to eat
[400.60 - 404.96] differently our lifestyles are different
[402.44 - 407.68] to be around people who understand that
[404.96 - 409.88] is just so nice yeah it's so beautiful
[407.68 - 411.44] the medical medium Community is so great
[409.88 - 414.08] did you come with anyone this evening or
[411.44 - 415.88] did you travel alone no last time I went
[414.08 - 417.76] to the book signing my I dragged my twin
[415.88 - 420.16] and my mom along but this time I came
[417.76 - 421.96] alone but I don't know it's very special
[420.16 - 424.16] to me because I probably never could
[421.96 - 425.96] have done something like this alone in
[424.16 - 429.56] the past and so to do it on my own is
[425.96 - 431.28] kind of celebration of me so you're
[429.56 - 432.32] healthy enough to travel to be here with
[431.28 - 433.64] everyone and I feel like you're not

[708.88 - 712.92] hopefully I'll get with him tonight just
[710.08 - 714.36] to say thank you above all things and um
[712.92 - 717.16] just sharing with everybody my healing
[714.36 - 719.24] Journey it's been a a couple years and a
[717.16 - 720.20] really hard couple years but um I know
[719.24 - 722.44] know a couple years ago I wouldn't been
[720.20 - 723.96] able to even fly to get here so this is
[722.44 - 725.52] a blessing in itself and where did you
[723.96 - 729.64] fly from again to get PA here in
[725.52 - 730.80] Sacramento so not too far but yes still
[729.64 - 732.96] it's still a jetty and you have to be
[730.80 - 734.72] well enough to to Trel you got to pack
[732.96 - 736.80] all your adrenal snacks and you still
[734.72 - 738.80] have to drink your water and you still
[736.80 - 741.24] have to do everything you do when you're
[738.80 - 743.60] at home yes yes what are you most
[741.24 - 746.44] excited about with this event tonight
[743.60 - 748.32] the food meeting Anthony and talking
[746.44 - 750.88] with everybody else it's super hard to
[748.32 - 752.12] find um restaurants that we can just sit
[750.88 - 753.40] down and just eat and not worry about
[752.12 - 755.16] what we're eating and knowing that it's
[753.40 - 756.96] all safe we don't have a lot of that
[755.16 - 759.40] especially up in my
[756.96 - 761.08] area and with Cafe Gratitude medical
[759.40 - 763.16] medium do you think that having these
[761.08 - 765.16] menus on the meal for people to on the
[763.16 - 766.44] menu for people to enjoy will make their
[765.16 - 769.44] healing Journey easier and more
[766.44 - 772.32] enjoyable absolutely a lot of us cannot
[769.44 - 773.88] go out to eat at all so we're making all
[772.32 - 775.92] of our meals we're prepping and as
[773.88 - 778.20] everyone knows it's like sometimes hours
[775.92 - 780.40] and days of prepping um and so just it's
[778.20 - 781.80] a sense of freedom yeah is what it is
[780.40 - 783.68] you know when you get sick and you're
[781.80 - 785.12] trying to heal you don't go out to
[783.68 - 787.92] restaurants and some of this is kind of
[785.12 - 789.80] just a way to feel free for the night
[787.92 - 792.56] and not worry knowing that it's safe
[789.80 - 794.80] right because Anthony's made this all
[792.56 - 797.80] possible so yeah which is incredible
[794.80 - 799.32] it's so exciting so exciting like so
[797.80 - 800.68] exciting so exciting could you talk a
[799.32 - 802.24] little bit about your healing journey
[800.68 - 805.88] and how the medical medium information

[808.80 - 812.04] had a adrenals fight or flight um
[810.92 - 813.76] doctors kept telling me it was anxiety
[812.04 - 815.84] and depression it was not anxiety kept
[813.76 - 818.88] giving me medications um I kept seeing
[815.84 - 821.44] Anthony on Facebook um books U my cousin

[821.44 - 828.80] protocols so he wow colon cancer huge
[824.88 - 830.88] mass gone um and so he kind of was like
[828.80 - 832.44] it's okay to try these things so I tried
[830.88 - 833.80] it and didn't tell any of my friends or
[832.44 - 835.56] family CU I didn't want to hear anything
[833.80 - 837.80] negative and they just saw me getting
[835.56 - 840.16] better and better and better um so I
[837.80 - 841.76] have healed from breast impant illness I

[931.72 - 935.80] made it everyone watching at home
[934.08 - 938.68] centara flew all the way from Australia
[935.80 - 940.52] to be here this evening yeah that's
[938.68 - 941.56] incredible especially you opened up
[940.52 - 942.64] about your healing Journey with
[941.56 - 944.36] everything that you've gone through and
[942.64 - 946.40] now to be able to travel to the United
[944.36 - 948.24] States it's incredible I've actually
[946.40 - 950.12] been reflecting on that a little bit
[948.24 - 952.08] like on the flight over here it would
[950.12 - 954.88] have been impossible if you would asked
[952.08 - 956.04] me years ago and even just growing up
[954.88 - 958.08] and going through all that I went
[956.04 - 959.92] through with my health being completely
[958.08 - 962.52] bedbound and having to turn down just
[959.92 - 964.08] the simplest of plans like literally
[962.52 - 966.12] just going out with friends I'd have to
[964.08 - 968.32] turn down plans I'd feel guilty I'd feel
[966.12 - 971.80] shame i' just all of this stuff growing
[968.32 - 973.60] up and to actually be flying here now
[971.80 - 976.76] and not turning that down being able to
[973.60 - 978.88] jump on a plane and get here and feel
[976.76 - 981.36] amazing and feel healthy and feel
[978.88 - 982.96] vibrant and have energy not be crashing
[981.36 - 984.68] in the middle of the day not have brain
[982.96 - 986.88] fog not have aches and pains and tingles
[984.68 - 989.60] and numbness and all the rest of it
[986.88 - 993.12] crazy gut issues which that
[989.60 - 995.68] like information has really just changed
[993.12 - 998.28] my life in such a pivotal way the
[995.68 - 1000.96] bloating the cramping the the gastric
[998.28 - 1002.52] pains and everything is gone wow it's
[1000.96 - 1004.16] just incredible I was following your
[1002.52 - 1006.16] Instagram by the way and I saw that you
[1004.16 - 1007.52] had some tips for traveling and I think
[1006.16 - 1009.16] it might be nice to share some of those
[1007.52 - 1011.16] tips on how you stay on the protocol
[1009.16 - 1012.88] whilst you're traveling cuz it seems it
[1011.16 - 1015.24] seems kind of hard and overwhelming at
[1012.88 - 1018.12] times I think especially with a longer
[1015.24 - 1020.56] flight it's so important for me to get
[1018.12 - 1022.16] lemon water in so I will be at the
[1020.56 - 1024.00] airport and I've made so many friends
[1022.16 - 1025.12] this way because people will ask what
[1024.00 - 1027.16] are you doing you're like squeezing
[1025.12 - 1029.84] lemons over there I will go through
[1027.16 - 1031.88] customs and get like some spring water
[1029.84 - 1034.04] I'll have my lemons already cut up ready
[1031.88 - 1036.20] to go right cuz I'll bring good tip
[1034.04 - 1038.08] that's a pro tip Pro tip cut your lemons
[1036.20 - 1039.88] up have them ready to go in a little
[1038.08 - 1042.20] sandwich bag and then I just squeeze
[1039.88 - 1044.88] them when I get through customs sit at a
[1042.20 - 1046.96] little cafe you know get the lemon water
[1044.88 - 1049.80] into the spring water and so I have that
[1046.96 - 1051.64] ready to go for my flight um and I do
[1049.80 - 1053.00] love bringing like things like bananas
[1051.64 - 1056.88] onto the flight they're just really
[1053.00 - 1058.44] simple and easy um and then on my flight
[1056.88 - 1060.84] which was really lucky they do serve
[1058.44 - 1062.92] fruit platters so I really love that
[1060.84 - 1064.88] option as well but those are just some
[1062.92 - 1066.36] incredible tips to keep hydrated if
[1064.88 - 1068.44] they've got coconut water at the airport
[1066.36 - 1069.96] I will grab one of those as well just
[1068.44 - 1072.88] anything to keep the hydration up when
[1069.96 - 1075.04] you're on that plane yes wow that's uh
[1072.88 - 1077.40] such amazing tips and I feel like
[1075.04 - 1078.44] tonight we're celebrating uh you know
[1077.40 - 1080.48] people that are coming like such as
[1078.44 - 1082.64] yourself your health for being able to
[1080.48 - 1084.24] travel to be feel good to be here this
[1082.64 - 1086.40] evening it's like a bit of a celebration
[1084.24 - 1087.76] of Health that you are able to be here
[1086.40 - 1090.36] and to enjoy this and connect with
[1087.76 - 1093.12] Community yeah it's honestly mindblowing
[1090.36 - 1096.56] to me to be here and to come have come
[1093.12 - 1098.40] this far over the years I don't really
[1096.56 - 1101.48] have words to describe it it honestly
[1098.40 - 1103.48] feels like a distant memory or a dream
[1101.48 - 1105.64] it doesn't even feel real to think of
[1103.48 - 1108.20] what I went through and but at the same
[1105.64 - 1109.80] time when I think back it's like like
[1108.20 - 1111.40] what Anthony that's that Soul's gold
[1109.80 - 1115.04] that you collect along the way and that
[1111.40 - 1117.28] wisdom that you collect it it means a
[1115.04 - 1119.52] lot as you go through that struggle of
[1117.28 - 1121.60] chronic illness it's not all for nothing
[1119.52 - 1123.60] when you get to the other side yeah it's
[1121.60 - 1126.56] like it never happened in a way it's
[1123.60 - 1128.68] like you can't even connect with it on
[1126.56 - 1131.00] the way as if you were experiencing like
[1128.68 - 1134.40] that but the wisdom and everything the
[1131.00 - 1137.68] knowledge and the experience you gain is
[1134.40 - 1139.40] more than words can describe do you feel
[1137.68 - 1141.96] like when you're on the other side you
[1139.40 - 1143.24] have a appreciation in a different way
[1141.96 - 1146.48] for all the things that you were now
[1143.24 - 1148.52] able to do yeah and more of an
[1146.48 - 1151.40] understanding and compassion as well I
[1148.52 - 1154.24] mean people it's really unfortunate to
[1151.40 - 1156.84] see the state of the world kind of
[1154.24 - 1158.68] getting sicker and sicker I'm seeing
[1156.84 - 1159.96] family and friends and people around me
[1158.68 - 1161.92] start to come down with their first
[1159.96 - 1164.40] symptoms and go on the doctor shopping
[1161.92 - 1166.92] journey and going doctor to doctor and
[1164.40 - 1168.92] you know I'm speaking with them and
[1166.92 - 1169.96] because of what I've been through I can
[1168.92 - 1172.48] really connect to what they're
[1169.96 - 1174.56] struggling with and it doesn't seem like
[1172.48 - 1175.84] like they know that people out there
[1174.56 - 1177.96] have been through what they've been
[1175.84 - 1180.00] through like I went through it so young
[1177.96 - 1182.08] and so I know I know the feeling and I
[1180.00 - 1183.76] can really relate to them and their
[1182.08 - 1186.92] experiences and be that kind of
[1183.76 - 1188.84] compassionate shoulder for them um but
[1186.92 - 1191.52] the gratitude that I feel being on the
[1188.84 - 1193.20] other side of the chronic illness that
[1191.52 - 1195.60] I've experienced throughout my life and
[1193.20 - 1196.68] just the emotional battles and the
[1195.60 - 1197.96] everything that I've been through the
[1196.68 - 1199.72] trauma everything that the medical
[1197.96 - 1202.32] medium information has really helped me
[1199.72 - 1205.96] heal from and just move
[1202.32 - 1207.96] past no words no words and speaking of
[1205.96 - 1210.36] gratitude we're here at Cafe Gratitude
[1207.96 - 1212.08] for the medical medium Cafe Gratitude
[1210.36 - 1213.60] collaboration what was it that made you
[1212.08 - 1216.44] want to get on a plane and come here you
[1213.60 - 1218.72] know this is a once in a-lifetime sort
[1216.44 - 1221.92] of opportunity and to be here with this
[1218.72 - 1224.12] community is unreal it's honestly at
[1221.92 - 1226.12] this point it's just like catching up
[1224.12 - 1227.72] with old friends again just with this
[1226.12 - 1229.96] whole year with all the other events as
[1227.72 - 1233.16] well um it's incredible just to connect

[1235.00 - 1238.56] forward to with this evening's events
[1237.12 - 1241.28] well I am really looking forward to
[1238.56 - 1243.92] trying the food I haven't tried it
[1241.28 - 1245.36] yet I know I'm really looking forward to
[1243.92 - 1247.04] it I've been eyeing off a few of the
[1245.36 - 1249.00] dishes have you tried them yet I've
[1247.04 - 1250.56] tried them yes it's so good and I just
[1249.00 - 1253.08] before we started the live stream I had
[1250.56 - 1255.84] the IR am precious smoothie oh
[1253.08 - 1257.92] refreshing oh refreshing slightly
[1255.84 - 1260.20] indulgent tasting but like you know it's
[1257.92 - 1262.04] good for you it's so good I'm I'm really
[1260.20 - 1264.56] looking forward to just feeling really
[1262.04 - 1266.40] light afterwards cuz there's no oil in
[1264.56 - 1268.84] there and because the ingredients are so
[1266.40 - 1271.04] clean and it's like who else does this
[1268.84 - 1272.68] out there no it's so hard to find on
[1271.04 - 1274.32] Friday night I was very excited for this
[1272.68 - 1276.28] event so on Friday night went to Cafe
[1274.32 - 1278.28] Gratitude in Venice tried the I am
[1276.28 - 1280.64] trustworthy the fajitas with the Millet
[1278.28 - 1283.12] tortilla they look oh my God and
[1280.64 - 1285.76] afterwards just felt so light yeah like
[1283.12 - 1287.52] you're saying like this incredible dish
[1285.76 - 1290.20] and it's like wow there's no oil there's
[1287.52 - 1292.60] nothing nasty in there you can just rest
[1290.20 - 1294.48] assured everything has been taken care
[1292.60 - 1296.40] of and you can eat and enjoy it and not
[1294.48 - 1298.96] be worried about your health or your
[1296.40 - 1300.68] healing going backwards it's supportive
[1298.96 - 1303.52] for all of that exactly do you think
[1300.68 - 1305.24] that Cafe Gratitude having these uh menu
[1303.52 - 1307.32] options from medical medium on their
[1305.24 - 1308.68] menu continuing forward will help other
[1307.32 - 1310.44] people with their healing Journey make
[1308.68 - 1312.72] it kind of easier and more enjoyable for
[1310.44 - 1315.28] them I think so I think so it's really
[1312.72 - 1317.32] convenient to have a place to go and
[1315.28 - 1319.68] pick up meals ready to go and have it
[1317.32 - 1322.32] made for you I know a lot of people can
[1319.68 - 1324.64] relate on the healing Journey having to
[1322.32 - 1326.68] really make all of the things yourself
[1324.64 - 1328.68] and so coming here and just enjoying
[1326.68 - 1330.40] this every once in a while and you know
[1328.68 - 1332.36] it being oil free as well is really
[1330.40 - 1333.68] supportive for people with really severe
[1332.36 - 1337.44] chronic health problems that are trying
[1333.68 - 1338.72] to avoid that higher sort of fat load um
[1337.44 - 1340.68] I think it's really supportive and

[1928.52 - 1932.24] other and we hit it off so well that we
[1930.44 - 1935.56] decided to not only go to the second one
[1932.24 - 1937.20] but also come tonight to the dinner
[1935.56 - 1939.16] that's what's so amazing about these
[1937.20 - 1940.76] events is that connecting with uh other
[1939.16 - 1942.20] individuals that have also been through
[1940.76 - 1944.32] these Journeys that are also doing the
[1942.20 - 1946.72] medical medium protocol it's so exciting
[1944.32 - 1949.16] it's very uplifting as well absolutely
[1946.72 - 1951.12] it it encourages me at least to keep
[1949.16 - 1953.68] going with these uh medical Medan
[1951.12 - 1955.88] protocols and um it's just awesome to
[1953.68 - 1958.72] have somebody who's also you know
[1955.88 - 1961.68] involved and a part of the community to
[1958.72 - 1963.52] be in touch with uh with people it's

[1987.68 - 1990.92] I think I was kind of we were both
[1989.24 - 1992.12] excited about the smaller amount of
[1990.92 - 1994.08] people coming so it was going to be a
[1992.12 - 1995.80] more intimate sort of evening have more
[1994.08 - 1997.44] time to talk to people even though I
[1995.80 - 1999.68] think it'd be very difficult I think we
[1997.44 - 2001.88] would both agree to top the Canyon from
[1999.68 - 2003.60] last time of 10 hours of sitting and
[2001.88 - 2005.52] talking with people with amazing food
[2003.60 - 2009.84] but I think tonight will be just as
[2005.52 - 2012.56] awesome yeah and uh I I I think uh extra
[2009.84 - 2014.24] few seconds with Anthony would be um you
[2012.56 - 2016.04] know amazing and it's what I'm looking
[2014.24 - 2017.72] forward to that was one thing that you

[2068.64 - 2073.16] milestone year for you absolutely
[2070.80 - 2075.44] absolutely it's I'm celebrating multiple
[2073.16 - 2076.92] ways today yes can you talk about some
[2075.44 - 2079.52] of the symptoms or conditions you've
[2076.92 - 2081.72] helded with medical medium information
[2079.52 - 2084.60] start with you uh yeah I was I was a
[2081.72 - 2087.92] total mess to start with um I mean it
[2084.60 - 2092.40] all began with uh I was symptomatic with
[2087.92 - 2094.64] regards to uh sinus sinuses issues uh I
[2092.40 - 2097.28] had um you know science infections
[2094.64 - 2101.04] periodically throughout the years up
[2097.28 - 2103.76] until 2011 when it it really got it got
[2101.04 - 2108.12] really you know worse and um I was on a
[2103.76 - 2109.76] psycho biotics I I then decided to I I
[2108.12 - 2113.16] suffered some side effects from that I
[2109.76 - 2116.60] decided to to play soccer just uh you
[2113.16 - 2120.04] know just I guess men's you know uh
[2116.60 - 2121.96] local soccer division around town and uh
[2120.04 - 2124.64] I sustained a concussion from that so I
[2121.96 - 2128.08] was a total mess from that I was on a
[2124.64 - 2131.36] chair daily for about 9 years easily 9
[2128.08 - 2133.96] years not able to do much so my biggest
[2131.36 - 2136.68] symptoms I would say are neurological uh
[2133.96 - 2140.32] issues um all kinds of other stuff like
[2136.68 - 2142.32] I said sinuses they they persisted and
[2140.32 - 2145.24] uh and most of that has has healed for
[2142.32 - 2147.28] the most part the B of is behind me but
[2145.24 - 2149.00] um there's still some work to do so I'm
[2147.28 - 2151.04] just excited about that finish line I
[2149.00 - 2153.68] could see it now that I you know
[2151.04 - 2155.60] surpassed so much and uh I've been
[2153.68 - 2157.48] through you know very very bad place to
[2155.60 - 2159.64] say the least and I'm just grateful to
[2157.48 - 2161.44] be be to be here on the light side of
[2159.64 - 2163.04] things we're grateful that you're here
[2161.44 - 2165.24] with us and that you've come so far on
[2163.04 - 2166.80] your journey and I am getting the signal
[2165.24 - 2168.84] that I do have to wrap it up or we can
[2166.80 - 2170.32] do one more I I before we quickly do one
[2168.84 - 2172.20] more we didn't get to hear your healing
[2170.32 - 2173.24] Journey so we just wanted to heal if if

[2177.24 - 2181.28] people who are hasn't had too many
[2179.12 - 2183.44] ailments but I've healed things like
[2181.28 - 2185.16] excessive dandruff and really high blood
[2183.44 - 2187.16] pressure um I would say a little bit of
[2185.16 - 2189.52] depression and depersonalization and
[2187.16 - 2190.80] anxiety as well and one of the most
[2189.52 - 2192.24] healing things aside from being on
[2190.80 - 2194.08] celery juice the heavy metal detox
[2192.24 - 2196.44] smoothie and you know staying away from
[2194.08 - 2198.28] no Foods has been coming to these events

[2322.28 - 2328.08] chronic
[2324.44 - 2331.80] illness um the medical medium
[2328.08 - 2335.00] information has answers and people can
[2331.80 - 2336.80] heal and you can do it pretty easily um
[2335.00 - 2340.64] maybe some people more easily than
[2336.80 - 2341.88] others but I had profound um effects
[2340.64 - 2344.24] even within the first week of
[2341.88 - 2346.72] implementing um celery juice and amongst
[2344.24 - 2349.36] a couple of other things so it's just
[2346.72 - 2351.08] it's profound um I would encourage
[2349.36 - 2353.20] anyone that has anyone in their family
[2351.08 - 2356.32] or themselves that are struggling with
[2353.20 - 2358.36] chronic illness or symptoms um that's
[2356.32 - 2361.56] making their life difficult to check
[2358.36 - 2363.24] this information out that's incredible
[2361.56 - 2365.24] thank you for sharing that I know I know
[2363.24 - 2366.76] it can be quite emotional would you mind
[2365.24 - 2368.24] sharing some of the symptoms and
[2366.76 - 2370.36] conditions that you hailed from using
[2368.24 - 2372.88] medical medium information if you feel
[2370.36 - 2375.44] comfortable absolutely um thank you and
[2372.88 - 2377.76] so I had a very long list of just small
[2375.44 - 2379.76] nagging symptoms so some of maybe not
[2377.76 - 2382.16] not so small as others but one of them
[2379.76 - 2384.92] was um I was having terrible indigestion
[2382.16 - 2387.32] and bloating and um difficulty even
[2384.92 - 2390.00] though I was eating um pretty healthy
[2387.32 - 2391.84] food and I was living a fairly healthy
[2390.00 - 2394.12] lifestyle I was still I was just never
[2391.84 - 2396.84] able to get over these um digestion
[2394.12 - 2400.04] issues and uh I know this sounds
[2396.84 - 2403.64] miraculous than it was I was able to
[2400.04 - 2405.76] heal uh make significant um progress
[2403.64 - 2407.44] with my digestion just within a week of
[2405.76 - 2410.04] celery juice and then making a couple
[2407.44 - 2413.16] changes to my diet it was profound and
[2410.04 - 2414.96] fast and it was like just I mean if I
[2413.16 - 2417.48] probably sat down and looked at every
[2414.96 - 2419.84] you know researched every little nagging
[2417.48 - 2423.08] symptom I had I I I had probably over 50
[2419.84 - 2426.96] and maybe maybe more might have been 75
[2423.08 - 2428.92] and um many of them are gone or um but
[2426.96 - 2430.76] if I get get too far off track some of
[2428.92 - 2435.08] them start coming back and then right
[2430.76 - 2438.24] back I go to the information and uh I'm
[2435.08 - 2441.08] doing fabulous I sleep really well and
[2438.24 - 2442.80] um I'm I'm happy and uh so it's
[2441.08 - 2446.44] wonderful and I just encourage anyone
[2442.80 - 2448.88] that has any um anything to to check it
[2446.44 - 2450.80] out cu it's really profound in what ways
[2448.88 - 2452.56] was your life limited by some of those
[2450.80 - 2454.68] Health struggles struggles that you had
[2452.56 - 2456.60] prior to the medical medium information
[2454.68 - 2459.40] so it was really um you know I struggled
[2456.60 - 2461.20] I'm I'm a mom my my kids ever since they
[2459.40 - 2463.16] were teenagers i' and they're in their
[2461.20 - 2465.72] 30s now um I really struggled with my
[2463.16 - 2467.80] health so it was difficult to be a good
[2465.72 - 2473.48] positive wonderful mom that I wanted to
[2467.80 - 2476.20] be so um I got that back and um uh being
[2473.48 - 2477.76] just a good a fun friend and a a fun
[2476.20 - 2480.36] person to go out and do things like I
[2477.76 - 2483.32] was really limited what I could do and
[2480.36 - 2486.28] um how much I could
[2483.32 - 2488.00] um uh enjoy my life I just really wasn't
[2486.28 - 2490.00] enjoying my life and it was just really
[2488.00 - 2491.52] hard on me and to not be able to go to
[2490.00 - 2494.68] social events and go to things and
[2491.52 - 2497.48] people just didn't understand and um so
[2494.68 - 2499.64] I've gotten all of that back and more
[2497.48 - 2501.92] that I wanted to enjoy my life and to do
[2499.64 - 2504.36] what I want to do and it's it's
[2501.92 - 2505.76] fantastic and profound yeah and now
[2504.36 - 2508.04] you're here let's celebrate for a moment
[2505.76 - 2510.72] that you're here in Los Angeles at this
[2508.04 - 2512.36] medical medium event with Cafe Gratitude
[2510.72 - 2514.52] you're about to have dinner a dinner
[2512.36 - 2518.00] that you can enjoy without feeling heavy
[2514.52 - 2519.68] and Bloated afterwards is that a is that
[2518.00 - 2521.84] super exciting for you because that I
[2519.68 - 2523.84] feel like this is a moment oh yeah and
[2521.84 - 2525.56] to have a restaurant like Cafe Gratitude
[2523.84 - 2529.04] offering something like this this is
[2525.56 - 2531.24] unheard of U in most restaurants and and
[2529.04 - 2532.96] it's available here and it's such a
[2531.24 - 2536.08] smashing success that hopefully other
[2532.96 - 2537.48] restaurants will see uh and people chefs
[2536.08 - 2539.84] and things like that will see the
[2537.48 - 2542.16] benefit of offering something like this
[2539.84 - 2544.32] and and the demand for it and hopefully
[2542.16 - 2545.56] it'll be available not only at Cafe
[2544.32 - 2547.40] Gratitude but hopefully it'll be
[2545.56 - 2550.04] available at other places as well maybe
[2547.40 - 2551.88] start something here yeah oh I I asked
[2550.04 - 2554.64] Cafe Gratitude um if they would be
[2551.88 - 2557.88] willing to sell franchises
[2554.64 - 2560.72] yeah that's not a bad
[2557.88 - 2562.72] idea do you think that Cafe Gratitude
[2560.72 - 2565.48] including the medical medium menu
[2562.72 - 2566.80] options uh for future uh will help
[2565.48 - 2569.24] people that are having the healing
[2566.80 - 2571.60] journey to be more enjoyable and easier
[2569.24 - 2573.52] for them to be able to come here for

[2580.80 - 2584.16] be wondering what what can I eat like

[10805.96 - 10810.56] here tonight has been unbelievable what
[10808.40 - 10813.44] is it that makes medical medium food
[10810.56 - 10816.12] different you know it's it's missing
[10813.44 - 10817.72] something that's what makes it different
[10816.12 - 10818.92] it's missing something it's missing a
[10817.72 - 10820.64] lot of things and I know there's a lot
[10818.92 - 10823.72] of talk out there about food and
[10820.64 - 10826.88] chemicals and things and you know and
[10823.72 - 10828.52] and pesticides and but people don't
[10826.88 - 10830.92] realize in the health movement yet
[10828.52 - 10832.52] they're they're not there as advanced
[10830.92 - 10834.64] the medical medium information is so
[10832.52 - 10836.76] Advanced they don't know about the
[10834.64 - 10840.32] citric acid they don't know about the
[10836.76 - 10842.88] natural flavor so much you know mm info
[10840.32 - 10846.32] broke that information out years and
[10842.88 - 10848.96] years and years ago and um and and so
[10846.32 - 10851.68] what medical medium food is missing is
[10848.96 - 10852.48] all those things it's missing the corn
[10851.68 - 10855.64] it's
[10852.48 - 10857.28] missing it's missing too many nuts and
[10855.64 - 10859.80] that's the thing like yeah nuts are good
[10857.28 - 10861.96] for us in different ways but too many
[10859.80 - 10864.72] nuts you know it's just nuts everybody's
[10861.96 - 10866.28] on all these so it's missing the soy
[10864.72 - 10868.40] which I've talked about all this time
[10866.28 - 10870.56] everybody said hey soy's you know you
[10868.40 - 10873.20] got to look out for GMO soy it's like no
[10870.56 - 10874.84] you got to look out for all of it you
[10873.20 - 10876.72] know you have to look out for all of it
[10874.84 - 10878.92] and the dishes here and this is what's
[10876.72 - 10880.80] incredible about Cafe grish at itude is
[10878.92 - 10883.04] that they've taken the medical medium
[10880.80 - 10886.96] dishes and recipes and they've elevated
[10883.04 - 10889.36] it and they it's unbelievable how pure
[10886.96 - 10891.00] how clean how you don't have to worry
[10889.36 - 10892.76] you don't have to say what's in here you
[10891.00 - 10895.08] don't have to say wait what is this or
[10892.76 - 10897.36] what is that it's that it's that
[10895.08 - 10899.28] wonderful it really is oh it it really
[10897.36 - 10901.76] is and I've heard you talk about how the
[10899.28 - 10903.88] chronically ill are not respected can
[10901.76 - 10905.64] you talk a little bit more about that I
[10903.88 - 10908.96] mean the chronically ill have been swept
[10905.64 - 10911.32] under the carpet for ages it they just
[10908.96 - 10912.72] have been um they've been ignored
[10911.32 - 10914.24] they've been told they're lazy they've
[10912.72 - 10917.80] been told that they're they're not
[10914.24 - 10919.84] really sick and even though the industry
[10917.80 - 10922.52] is changing in the health world where
[10919.84 - 10925.04] they're recognizing um conditions and
[10922.52 - 10926.84] they're recognizing symptoms more and
[10925.04 - 10928.44] you know there's some good people good
[10926.84 - 10931.72] professionals working in the health
[10928.44 - 10934.24] field it's still not enough The Chronic
[10931.72 - 10936.12] chronically ill are still disrespected
[10934.24 - 10938.16] they're still not listened to enough
[10936.12 - 10940.88] they're still not understood they're
[10938.16 - 10942.96] seen as a bank roll too uh that's
[10940.88 - 10945.32] another thing in the health industry now
[10942.96 - 10947.40] so you know it's it's it's all about you
[10945.32 - 10948.92] know likes and clicks and everything and
[10947.40 - 10951.28] I understand that's how the industry
[10948.92 - 10953.48] works but the chronically ill you know
[10951.28 - 10956.40] you have to look out for them you have
[10953.48 - 10959.16] to care about them and that's not there
[10956.40 - 10961.68] you know it's like yeah people are sick
[10959.16 - 10964.36] they're suffering and struggling sure
[10961.68 - 10967.24] right but we need to care and we need to
[10964.36 - 10970.00] look out for them and really focus on
[10967.24 - 10972.32] like what's best for them and that's
[10970.00 - 10974.36] been my entire Mission it's about what's
[10972.32 - 10976.80] best for the chronically ill what do
[10974.36 - 10979.96] they really need what can really protect
[10976.80 - 10981.92] them and and keep them safe with all the
[10979.96 - 10984.56] different obstacles and the pitfalls out
[10981.92 - 10986.40] there and the snares and the tiger traps
[10984.56 - 10988.72] they're there and they're there for
[10986.40 - 10991.80] people who are healthy enough now but
[10988.72 - 10993.00] everybody's getting sick everybody and
[10991.80 - 10995.16] when people think they're not going to
[10993.00 - 10997.24] get sick how do you think we end up
[10995.16 - 11000.76] leaving this planet we get sick
[10997.24 - 11002.44] somewhere somehow down the line and so
[11000.76 - 11004.28] yeah it may be a little later for
[11002.44 - 11006.96] someone it may be a little later for
[11004.28 - 11009.40] this person but everybody becomes
[11006.96 - 11011.12] chronically ill at some point eventually
[11009.40 - 11014.16] so we should respect a chronically ill
[11011.12 - 11015.96] when we're not sick because we need to
[11014.16 - 11018.20] understand what they're what what
[11015.96 - 11020.40] they're doing to heal what they're doing
[11018.20 - 11022.56] to move forward because that's precious
[11020.40 - 11024.40] information that other people can use
[11022.56 - 11025.92] that aren't sick now but then they run
[11024.40 - 11028.08] across somebody in their family or a
[11025.92 - 11030.16] friend that gets sick and they can have
[11028.08 - 11031.36] this powerful information and and
[11030.16 - 11033.36] actually you know spread this
[11031.36 - 11036.20] information with the chronic ill for
[11033.36 - 11038.68] years been called like liars and and
[11036.20 - 11040.56] they're lazy and they're you know
[11038.68 - 11042.92] they're not really sick and they're
[11040.56 - 11045.08] making it up it's all in their head or
[11042.92 - 11047.40] they're just bored or something or
[11045.08 - 11051.76] they're just neurotic or have some kind
[11047.40 - 11053.72] of phobia when really they got sick they
[11051.76 - 11056.20] got real reasons There's real reasons
[11053.72 - 11058.00] underneath there inside their body
[11056.20 - 11060.76] that's why they're struggling and
[11058.00 - 11062.64] anything like OCD or PTSD that comes
[11060.76 - 11064.40] later for a lot of people who are sick
[11062.64 - 11067.48] it's from being sick too long it's not
[11064.40 - 11070.68] respected it's not people are not
[11067.48 - 11072.64] appreciated they're um and that should
[11070.68 - 11074.96] change and I think medical medium
[11072.64 - 11077.72] information and the mission is to help
[11074.96 - 11079.52] The Chronic leel and to change that to
[11077.72 - 11081.40] change that narrative out there that's
[11079.52 - 11083.96] out you know that's happening to the
[11081.40 - 11085.52] sick people who are struggling and we
[11083.96 - 11086.92] need to do something about it and this
[11085.52 - 11089.56] is an incredible step right here we're
[11086.92 - 11091.88] at Cafe GR they have the the best meals
[11089.56 - 11094.96] they're using the medical medium
[11091.88 - 11096.76] information they're putting the meals
[11094.96 - 11098.96] together in a way that's never been done
[11096.76 - 11100.40] before so it doesn't get any better yeah
[11098.96 - 11102.44] it's incredible you're talking about the
[11100.40 - 11104.04] medical medium information so why is it
[11102.44 - 11105.48] that so many people are healing I've

[13814.96 - 13820.56] the Forefront of time right now right
[13817.72 - 13824.04] this is the present moment of time every
[13820.56 - 13828.04] second that clicks forward we in it
[13824.04 - 13828.04] together think about that a little
[13828.48 - 13836.92] bit how many civilizations have come and
[13832.36 - 13839.56] gone right why are we here altto
[13836.92 - 13842.52] together doing medical medium
[13839.56 - 13845.32] information you know healing how are we
[13842.52 - 13847.68] all in here in this restaurant this
[13845.32 - 13850.68] beautiful incredible restaurant together
[13847.68 - 13852.72] right now with all the civilizations
[13850.68 - 13856.56] that have come and
[13852.72 - 13859.16] gone think about that one billions of
[13856.56 - 13861.16] people have come and
[13859.16 - 13863.64] gone
[13861.16 - 13867.08] billions throughout the
[13863.64 - 13868.92] years but we're here on the Forefront of
[13867.08 - 13871.72] time right
[13868.92 - 13873.40] now and that then leads me to something
[13871.72 - 13875.08] Spirit of compassion has always told me
[13873.40 - 13878.88] is
[13875.08 - 13881.16] we come back if you're okay with that
[13878.88 - 13884.40] one I know some people are like no you
[13881.16 - 13887.64] don't come back you're just you're here
[13884.40 - 13889.12] and then you're gone and that's it I
[13887.64 - 13892.20] actually know it's
[13889.12 - 13895.80] different I actually know it's
[13892.20 - 13899.12] different and the information I get is
[13895.80 - 13902.64] we're always on that Forefront of time
[13899.12 - 13905.16] so we're back but we're right here
[13902.64 - 13909.36] together now is it a coincidence we're
[13905.16 - 13912.36] all here together tonight no way no way
[13909.36 - 13915.40] it's not possible it's
[13912.36 - 13917.00] not and I noticed in the medical medium
[13915.40 - 13918.68] community and I've said this before that
[13917.00 - 13920.56] there's really old souls here okay
[13918.68 - 13924.24] you've heard that before you've heard
[13920.56 - 13925.48] that right maybe you saw somebody maybe
[13924.24 - 13927.12] you saw an intuitive and they're like
[13925.48 - 13929.68] you're an old
[13927.12 - 13931.64] soul and people talk about that but the
[13929.68 - 13934.16] people in this community really are old
[13931.64 - 13937.40] souls there's a lot of reasons there's a
[13934.16 - 13940.84] len tested for that there's reasons to
[13937.40 - 13942.48] believe that you guys are old souls so
[13940.84 - 13945.72] if you ever doubt it you're like I don't
[13942.48 - 13950.16] know how old of a soul I really
[13945.72 - 13952.64] am but you really are one of those
[13950.16 - 13956.40] reasons to believe that you're a really
[13952.64 - 13958.08] old soul is that you guys are brave you
[13956.40 - 13960.88] found this information and something
[13958.08 - 13964.88] spoke to you whether it's Angelic forces
[13960.88 - 13968.48] Supernatural forces I hear the book just
[13964.88 - 13970.24] landed on somebody's lap one day maybe
[13968.48 - 13973.68] it was in a doctor's office on a coffee
[13970.24 - 13975.96] table maybe a friend just said try this
[13973.68 - 13977.00] maybe it was in a store somewhere but
[13975.96 - 13979.92] there's a
[13977.00 - 13981.96] supernatural connection to how that book
[13979.92 - 13983.72] got to you or that information got to
[13981.96 - 13986.44] you it's much different than anything
[13983.72 - 13988.32] else out there in the world of Health
[13986.44 - 13990.40] you talk to other people out there and
[13988.32 - 13992.52] it's like yeah I saw some ad on social
[13990.40 - 13994.56] media and I'm trying this bioh hack and
[13992.52 - 13996.44] that's what it is but that's not how the
[13994.56 - 13999.72] medical medium information works or the
[13996.44 - 14001.56] people that Discover it how it works
[13999.72 - 14004.24] it's an entirely different situation
[14001.56 - 14005.72] when you ask people how did you find out
[14004.24 - 14007.88] well I found out through my loved one
[14005.72 - 14009.48] how did they find out well you know what
[14007.88 - 14012.32] they were in a store and it spoke to
[14009.48 - 14015.00] them and they saw it on the shelf and it
[14012.32 - 14017.16] spoke to them it fell off the shelf
[14015.00 - 14019.88] someone told me years
[14017.16 - 14022.04] ago that the medical medium book fell
[14019.88 - 14025.04] off the shelf right in front of them in
[14022.04 - 14026.68] Barnes & Noble they were just walking
[14025.04 - 14027.88] down the aisle they weren't even looking
[14026.68 - 14030.08] for a health
[14027.88 - 14031.52] book they were sick but they weren't
[14030.08 - 14033.80] even in there doing that they were
[14031.52 - 14036.20] cutting through the aisle and as they
[14033.80 - 14039.00] were cutting through the book just
[14036.20 - 14042.12] nudged itself off the shelf they watched
[14039.00 - 14043.92] it and it landed on the ground face up
[14042.12 - 14046.88] they picked it up and they said what is
[14043.92 - 14046.88] this and who is
[14051.56 - 14059.56] this they held on to it they read
[14055.92 - 14062.00] it and they realized it saved their life
[14059.56 - 14064.04] it saved their life and they're an old
[14062.00 - 14066.76] soul now a lot of times I've said this
[14064.04 - 14069.84] I'm not the oldest soul I was given this
[14066.76 - 14071.88] gift yes you guys know about it you guys
[14069.84 - 14073.96] know and you probably get a lot of
[14071.88 - 14078.32] for it too you listen to the medical
[14073.96 - 14081.64] medium you you read his
[14078.32 - 14083.20] stuff right I never knew when I was four
[14081.64 - 14087.76] years old that it would give a lot of
[14083.20 - 14091.36] people but my great grandfather he
[14087.76 - 14092.76] knew and my parents they knew they're
[14091.36 - 14095.40] still
[14092.76 - 14097.68] alive trying to convince my dad to go on
[14095.40 - 14100.52] to a podcast someday with me and I
[14097.68 - 14104.40] actually think he's going to do
[14100.52 - 14104.40] it and and my
[14105.08 - 14109.08] mom
[14106.60 - 14112.96] but there's something to be said about
[14109.08 - 14116.56] that you know it's it's you have to have
[14112.96 - 14120.44] a bigger Consciousness to do medical
[14116.56 - 14123.84] medium so you have to be an older
[14120.44 - 14127.76] Soul right you just
[14123.84 - 14131.80] do because the information blows your
[14127.76 - 14134.44] mind it's blown my mind right when I
[14131.80 - 14136.72] heard the information from above my mind
[14134.44 - 14139.20] was blown when I did the last books the
[14136.72 - 14141.56] brain saer books it was too much almost
[14139.20 - 14145.56] on me because I was like what every
[14141.56 - 14145.56] sentence was like what
[14146.64 - 14150.28] but I've always said I'm not the oldest
[14148.08 - 14152.36] soul I just have something inside of me
[14150.28 - 14154.32] the spirit of compassion said you'll do
[14152.36 - 14160.52] you'll
[14154.32 - 14163.04] do you might you might not be the oldest
[14160.52 - 14164.72] Soul the people who will receive this
[14163.04 - 14166.68] information are going to be old souls
[14164.72 - 14170.60] you might not be the oldest Soul they'll
[14166.68 - 14173.20] be thousands of years older than you for
[14170.60 - 14175.88] sure but you got something inside of you
[14173.20 - 14180.04] and we need that
[14175.88 - 14180.04] you got something kind of tough about
[14180.48 - 14185.96] you like
[14182.80 - 14189.04] really I'm that
[14185.96 - 14193.76] tough tough enough to hear the voice and
[14189.04 - 14196.68] hang in there stay sane you know and and
[14193.76 - 14199.44] through that process you know message
[14196.68 - 14202.80] message and message but that's only a
[14199.44 - 14208.20] part of it it's nothing without you guys
[14202.80 - 14210.48] it's nothing it is I could be in my own
[14208.20 - 14214.24] little room somewhere getting the
[14210.48 - 14217.24] information from above receiving it
[14214.24 - 14220.60] learning about it and in the end what
[14217.24 - 14224.24] does that do if I can't get it out to
[14220.60 - 14226.24] you guys you know I think what happens
[14224.24 - 14228.56] when an author and I forget I'm an
[14226.24 - 14231.52] author I actually forget because in the
[14228.56 - 14234.48] end I'm not writing the
[14231.52 - 14237.84] books it's coming from above it's
[14234.48 - 14241.88] prophecies it's Advanced information so
[14237.84 - 14244.20] really am I even an author probably not
[14241.88 - 14247.16] but on the book it says
[14244.20 - 14249.80] so
[14247.16 - 14252.32] right but if I didn't have the ability
[14249.80 - 14254.16] to get this information out there and I
[14252.32 - 14257.96] remember when my
[14254.16 - 14261.12] publisher okay they were like yeah we we
[14257.96 - 14264.20] want you we we want to help people I
[14261.12 - 14265.92] couldn't believe it couldn't believe it
[14264.20 - 14269.16] we want to get the message out because
[14265.92 - 14272.20] we've never seen anything like this and
[14269.16 - 14274.84] I was like oh my God there is a God
[14272.20 - 14275.84] there is because I could just be sitting
[14274.84 - 14280.00] in my
[14275.84 - 14282.80] room right scribbling the information on
[14280.00 - 14284.80] papers and piling them up and it never
[14282.80 - 14288.16] going
[14284.80 - 14291.36] anywhere so I'm only one half of it you
[14288.16 - 14294.84] guys are the other half of it the other
[14291.36 - 14298.24] half and you guys do the work you guys
[14294.84 - 14301.04] do it even if you're dabbling it still
[14298.24 - 14303.32] counts I don't want anybody to think oh
[14301.04 - 14305.16] I'm dabbling and maybe I'm not that into
[14303.32 - 14308.00] no you're into it and it's going to kind
[14305.16 - 14311.08] of ebb and flow it might be like now
[14308.00 - 14313.36] you're doing one thing and then you look
[14311.08 - 14315.92] up in the book or you see something I've
[14313.36 - 14317.88] said that's coming from above and you do
[14315.92 - 14320.24] another thing and another
[14317.88 - 14321.88] thing and I know the road is hard you
[14320.24 - 14324.40] guys got a lot of faith you guys got a
[14321.88 - 14326.84] lot of faith because the stuff out there
[14324.40 - 14328.72] challenges that a lot right and so
[14326.84 - 14332.28] you're like what do I do I heard this
[14328.72 - 14335.72] thing out here what do I do you know aw
[14332.28 - 14337.12] is not a science Professor no not that
[14335.72 - 14339.68] the science professors get people
[14337.12 - 14341.44] chronically ill better I mean how many
[14339.68 - 14345.20] do I don't
[14341.44 - 14347.64] know but it's it's easy to be challenged
[14345.20 - 14349.80] and then your faith is challenged and
[14347.64 - 14351.80] then you're like what do I do and then
[14349.80 - 14354.16] you being an old soul you come back to
[14351.80 - 14356.16] and say I know what I'm doing I know
[14354.16 - 14358.80] what I need to do this is the
[14356.16 - 14360.36] information it is working it got people

[14579.16 - 14583.76] heal every god-given right to heal never
[14581.64 - 14586.52] forget that I have to say it time and
[14583.76 - 14588.84] time again because we can easily believe
[14586.52 - 14591.04] that we don't deserve to heal we don't
[14588.84 - 14593.80] deserve it because the world beats us
[14591.04 - 14596.36] down and it's very hard here on planet
[14593.80 - 14599.56] Earth planet stress is what I call it
[14596.36 - 14599.56] you guys heard me say that
[14599.76 - 14606.12] before but we have the tools to keep our

[14615.44 - 14620.96] of it I love when people try to you know
[14618.96 - 14624.12] call out on medical
[14620.96 - 14626.24] medium and they're like he doesn't say
[14624.12 - 14630.16] the food does anything he doesn't say
[14626.24 - 14632.32] the food heals he's all about
[14630.16 - 14634.44] supplements if you read the books and
[14632.32 - 14637.12] you learn the information food is a
[14634.44 - 14640.32] massive piece of it a massive piece of
[14637.12 - 14641.80] it and yeah this world is so difficult
[14640.32 - 14644.16] and there's so many exposures that we
[14641.80 - 14648.00] need some things added to that yes we

[15300.64 - 15305.92] little time and you'll see things

[15305.92 - 15311.64] know what my purpose is now I know what
[15307.60 - 15313.24] my true purpose is Right which leads me
[15311.64 - 15314.56] to say one thing that's really important
[15313.24 - 15316.08] about the medical medium Community is
[15314.56 - 15320.20] about you guys
[15316.08 - 15322.96] here right here is that you guys have
[15320.20 - 15325.76] purpose but you guys have what purpose
[15322.96 - 15327.48] plus sounds a little corny I always
[15325.76 - 15330.64] thought that when I heard that from SSC
[15327.48 - 15330.64] I'm like what do you mean what's purpose
[15331.04 - 15338.92] plus like what is
[15334.12 - 15341.76] that purpose plus is having more than
[15338.92 - 15344.16] one purpose everybody's caught up in
[15341.76 - 15346.92] their mind and they think it's one
[15344.16 - 15348.48] purpose and that's their purpose they
[15346.92 - 15350.12] feel lost and they don't even think they
[15348.48 - 15352.80] have a purpose because it's this one
[15350.12 - 15355.68] purpose they're looking
[15352.80 - 15359.00] for you guys have multiple purposes you
[15355.68 - 15360.80] have lots of purpose purpose plus

[15445.72 - 15449.96] right lad down on this on some of the
[15448.44 - 15452.28] masterful work that you've done with the
[15449.96 - 15455.16] medical medium dishes I know they're no
[15452.28 - 15458.20] oil no nuts which is incredible all on
[15455.16 - 15460.56] its own gluten-free soy free soy free
[15458.20 - 15463.24] and easy on the salt exactly so tell me
[15460.56 - 15465.44] a little bit about how like working with
[15463.24 - 15467.08] those parameters and everything well I
[15465.44 - 15469.32] mean it was like I said it was a great
[15467.08 - 15471.12] opportunity to look at cooking in a new
[15469.32 - 15473.56] way so it was and and to look for
[15471.12 - 15475.76] alternatives to the traditional flavor
[15473.56 - 15477.12] builders that we usually use in food um
[15475.76 - 15478.72] as you know part of the collaboration
[15477.12 - 15480.28] that we have here is that we assign
[15478.72 - 15481.88] affirmation names to all of our food
[15480.28 - 15484.76] which actually helps the healing process
[15481.88 - 15487.12] in our opinion um and mine too yeah
[15484.76 - 15489.56] right it is a good thing so here we have
[15487.12 - 15491.72] imys which is our green papaya and kelp
[15489.56 - 15494.44] noodle salad um with a coconut based
[15491.72 - 15496.60] dressing and lots of TI spices and herbs
[15494.44 - 15498.56] here we've got the I Am Noble for the
[15496.60 - 15500.40] noble potato cuz it's the spicy potato
[15498.56 - 15502.64] burrito bowl with your cheese sauce and
[15500.40 - 15504.24] the potato is Noble for sure exactly and
[15502.64 - 15506.32] a healing food a lot of people don't
[15504.24 - 15507.96] know that so that's really powerful the
[15506.32 - 15509.36] name goes perfect with it right there
[15507.96 - 15510.68] and we've got a black beam Pico that
[15509.36 - 15512.84] goes with that and then some water
[15510.68 - 15514.64] sauteed kale and some great Pico deallo
[15512.84 - 15516.20] well you got the kale that's incredible
[15514.64 - 15518.28] to got some greens in there to sort of
[15516.20 - 15521.60] lighten it up a bit and so this is I am
[15518.28 - 15524.52] trustworthy which is your uh original
[15521.60 - 15525.84] portabello and uh pepper fajita dish
[15524.52 - 15528.12] we've dressed it up with a little bit of
[15525.84 - 15530.04] lemon marinated red onions some
[15528.12 - 15531.88] guacamole and some Pico de Gaya with a
[15530.04 - 15533.80] squeeze of lime as well and we serve it
[15531.88 - 15534.92] with the Millet tortillas which are I
[15533.80 - 15536.84] think you're sort of famous for those
[15534.92 - 15539.64] right and you can see it's the Perfect
[15536.84 - 15541.64] Blend and you got the Millet tortilla
[15539.64 - 15543.52] you can put a little bit of guacamole in
[15541.64 - 15545.40] there you can put a little bit of the
[15543.52 - 15547.52] onion in there you can make it the way
[15545.40 - 15549.00] you want it that's incredible and then
[15547.52 - 15550.88] it becomes like finger food then you
[15549.00 - 15553.00] have in your hands you can enjoy it then
[15550.88 - 15554.56] you could add a little bit more want
[15553.00 - 15556.20] those little tortillas in my hand and I
[15554.56 - 15558.32] want to put a little that because I've
[15556.20 - 15560.32] tried guacamole in different places and
[15558.32 - 15562.68] Cafe Gratitude guacamole is another
[15560.32 - 15564.28] level it actually has flavor and that's
[15562.68 - 15566.36] the key well in part of the affirmation
[15564.28 - 15567.88] healing you can trust that everything in
[15566.36 - 15569.28] this plate is going to be good for the
[15567.88 - 15570.04] body right so that's why we're calling
[15569.28 - 15571.84] it
[15570.04 - 15573.80] trustworthy and the last one that we're
[15571.84 - 15576.52] having as part of the menu here is the I
[15573.80 - 15579.00] am insightful which is a jasmine rice
[15576.52 - 15581.44] and organic jasmine rice vegetable Sushi
[15579.00 - 15582.96] we serve it with uh pumpkin seed tofu
[15581.44 - 15584.80] which is something that I think is a
[15582.96 - 15587.60] really great soy alternative another
[15584.80 - 15590.00] whole food avocado some vegetables
[15587.60 - 15591.24] carrots cabbage and also some cucumber
[15590.00 - 15594.08] in there as well you got the zinc and
[15591.24 - 15596.60] the Pumpkin Seed so there's just there's
[15594.08 - 15598.20] healing there's all kinds of different
[15596.60 - 15600.28] aspects of these dishes that are healing
[15598.20 - 15602.44] and I want to go to the papaya which is
[15600.28 - 15605.24] incredible you're not using the Hawaiian
[15602.44 - 15607.32] papaya no that is mindblowing right
[15605.24 - 15609.12] there because you know like just if
[15607.32 - 15611.04] somebody's going to use papaya it always
[15609.12 - 15613.56] seems to be the Hawaiian papaya and I'm
[15611.04 - 15616.80] like no this is incredible so you got
[15613.56 - 15619.44] the shredded papaya and that's IM am wi
[15616.80 - 15621.88] yes we we work with Organics pretty much
[15619.44 - 15624.00] exclusively and I believe under the
[15621.88 - 15626.40] organic certifications you can't have
[15624.00 - 15627.80] the genetically modified papaya so
[15626.40 - 15629.36] that's why we don't go with the Hawaiian
[15627.80 - 15631.20] one unfortunately but that's just the
[15629.36 - 15632.76] reality it's just the reality of it oh
[15631.20 - 15634.76] we forgot the precious the uh wild
[15632.76 - 15637.68] blueberry and cherry smoothie there it
[15634.76 - 15639.00] is right there an mm smoothie okay and
[15637.68 - 15640.72] that's the wild blueberry that's the
[15639.00 - 15643.84] Cherry people are going to love the
[15640.72 - 15646.68] flavor it's juice yeah oh it's so good
[15643.84 - 15649.48] and so so rich but yet so light you're
[15646.68 - 15652.56] satiated but you won't leave like we're
[15649.48 - 15654.20] feeling real heavy and greasy and all
[15652.56 - 15656.84] that it's just absolutely not absolutely
[15654.20 - 15658.40] not just healing food people can fill up
[15656.84 - 15660.08] get satiated and then they can do
[15658.40 - 15661.32] whatever they need to do their workouts
[15660.08 - 15662.92] they can go to the beach whatever they
[15661.32 - 15666.04] got to do live their life but they got
[15662.92 - 15667.76] the best food purest forms they don't
[15666.04 - 15669.40] have the uh the nuts and the oils and
[15667.76 - 15670.96] I'm saying that like nuts are terrible
[15669.40 - 15673.80] or anything like that it's just that
[15670.96 - 15676.08] these are breaking those rules and it's
[15673.80 - 15678.32] like the no oil the no soy the no gluten
[15676.08 - 15680.20] the no nuts and then the easy on the
[15678.32 - 15681.88] salt I mean it's mind-blowing well the
[15680.20 - 15683.56] more the more guidelines that we can
[15681.88 - 15685.36] follow here the the more people we can
[15683.56 - 15687.12] bring into this way of eating right so
[15685.36 - 15689.52] if somebody wants to eat healthier but
[15687.12 - 15690.76] can't eat nuts then half of the menu you
[15689.52 - 15692.24] know is not going to be available in
[15690.76 - 15693.80] this case they can have the whole thing
[15692.24 - 15696.64] there's no nothing that they don't have
[15693.80 - 15699.16] to uh not have you know I challenge
[15696.64 - 15701.00] people to come in and try it I really do
[15699.16 - 15703.76] I want to see what their pal how their
[15701.00 - 15706.08] palette responds how they feel about the
[15703.76 - 15708.80] flavors I want to see them give it a
[15706.08 - 15710.84] shot try it see what they like about it
[15708.80 - 15712.60] I want them to be honest about how they
[15710.84 - 15714.76] feel everything and that's what I'm

[16164.96 - 16168.24] remind me what was your favorite dish
[16166.80 - 16169.76] you know I kind of liked everything um
[16168.24 - 16171.68] my friend and I we came here yesterday
[16169.76 - 16173.00] to kind of test a few things out and I
[16171.68 - 16174.80] didn't get the sushi thinking that it
[16173.00 - 16176.20] wasn't going to be good or having had
[16174.80 - 16178.16] sushi a really long time ago just
[16176.20 - 16179.72] conventional and been liking it and
[16178.16 - 16181.28] tonight was a really really big surprise
[16179.72 - 16182.84] I think it was one of my favorites but
[16181.28 - 16184.44] to pick one would be be very very
[16182.84 - 16185.60] difficult they were all really amazing
[16184.44 - 16187.08] that's so interesting a lot of people
[16185.60 - 16188.84] are saying that about the sushi that
[16187.08 - 16189.92] they were just so surprised and that a
[16188.84 - 16192.48] lot of people are saying it's one of
[16189.92 - 16194.60] their favorites absolutely yeah I mean I
[16192.48 - 16195.68] guess the the chef that made it really
[16194.60 - 16197.76] really worked hard and I wouldn't be
[16195.68 - 16199.52] surprised if had some input on how to
[16197.76 - 16201.40] put things together really well and it
[16199.52 - 16203.36] was just an awesome experience what was
[16201.40 - 16205.52] your favorite part of the evening my
[16203.36 - 16206.96] favorite part I think uh I came in here
[16205.52 - 16209.08] just being really excited to talk to a
[16206.96 - 16210.80] lot of people and last time I think it
[16209.08 - 16212.84] was really Soul healing for me and the
[16210.80 - 16215.04] same thing happened tonight just feel
[16212.84 - 16217.24] much much lighter being amongst I think
[16215.04 - 16219.00] people who think the same yeah it's
[16217.24 - 16221.00] beautiful what was your experience like
[16219.00 - 16222.60] with the life loss with the light blast
[16221.00 - 16224.72] I think for me it takes a little while
[16222.60 - 16226.24] until I feel the effects but immediately
[16224.72 - 16229.00] it's kind of like just a feeling of
[16226.24 - 16231.48] lightness and more of a presence kind of
[16229.00 - 16234.76] like um maybe dis Association and like
[16231.48 - 16237.44] brain fog being a little bit better you
[16234.76 - 16239.60] know and continuing your medical medium
[16237.44 - 16241.00] Journey uh would you like to share with
[16239.60 - 16243.20] anyone out there one piece of
[16241.00 - 16245.40] information that has really been a game
[16243.20 - 16247.12] changer in your healing Journey
[16245.40 - 16249.40] absolutely so I know for example you
[16247.12 - 16251.80] can't always do something perfectly you
[16249.40 - 16253.32] know you might continue eating meat or
[16251.80 - 16255.12] you know minimizing how many eggs you
[16253.32 - 16257.24] eat but one thing that I was doing which
[16255.12 - 16258.60] was holding me back with strap and this
[16257.24 - 16261.04] was something that was brought up to me
[16258.60 - 16262.92] by a woman that um I talked to in
[16261.04 - 16265.48] Calabasas not Calabasas sorry at the
[16262.92 - 16267.76] first event in June in Clover City was
[16265.48 - 16270.00] that eating rice is not really good for
[16267.76 - 16271.76] strep because you might not realize but
[16270.00 - 16273.76] it creates an environment in your body
[16271.76 - 16275.08] that that really allow strep to prosper
[16273.76 - 16276.76] and I hadn't really realized that and
[16275.08 - 16278.72] it's interesting it sometimes it can
[16276.76 - 16279.92] take a long time for you to either find
[16278.72 - 16282.36] the information in a book or from
[16279.92 - 16283.76] someone and realize the full scope of it
[16282.36 - 16285.44] you might be doing celeres you might be
[16283.76 - 16286.72] doing the heavy metal detox but there
[16285.44 - 16288.96] might be a few things that you're still
[16286.72 - 16290.40] doing wrong that can Propel you further
[16288.96 - 16292.24] when you stop doing them I think that
[16290.40 - 16293.96] would be a big piece of advice yes
[16292.24 - 16296.08] that's so interesting that like you're
[16293.96 - 16297.72] saying there's some things that are
[16296.08 - 16299.56] maybe like hidden causes or things you
[16297.72 - 16301.16] don't think of that are causing your
[16299.56 - 16303.12] maybe like setbacks or your healing
[16301.16 - 16305.08] journey to progress forward a little bit
[16303.12 - 16306.40] more so yeah thank you for sharing that
[16305.08 - 16308.88] information I'm going to keep that in
[16306.40 - 16310.80] mind as well absolutely yes well I'm so
[16308.88 - 16312.24] glad that you came out this evening did
[16310.80 - 16314.36] you enjoy meeting all those new people
[16312.24 - 16315.96] at the table absolutely and we connected
[16314.36 - 16317.40] and hopefully when another event happens
[16315.96 - 16319.36] here in California or potentially
[16317.40 - 16321.12] somewhere else that will come together
[16319.36 - 16322.40] or even you know come together
[16321.12 - 16324.32] separately I mean what was really
[16322.40 - 16327.00] interesting was it seemed like we were
[16324.32 - 16329.44] seated very intentionally that there
[16327.00 - 16331.60] were two women at my table who found out
[16329.44 - 16333.04] that they live blocks apart you know so
[16331.60 - 16335.16] I was telling them it'd be amazing for
[16333.04 - 16336.64] them to have a dinner together oh wow so
[16335.16 - 16339.28] you're saying they live blocks apart
[16336.64 - 16340.92] blocks apart yeah and they connected
[16339.28 - 16343.52] this evening not knowing that like their
[16340.92 - 16345.20] blocks apart being medical medium
[16343.52 - 16346.96] followers and part of the community and
[16345.20 - 16348.36] they got to connect here in Los Angeles
[16346.96 - 16351.00] absolutely just happened to be sitting
[16348.36 - 16352.92] at the same table wow that's incredible
[16351.00 - 16356.44] do you think that like Cafe Gratitude
[16352.92 - 16358.52] having this uh medical medium menu uh as
[16356.44 - 16361.00] part of their own menu will help people
[16358.52 - 16364.00] heal and make it a bit easier and more
[16361.00 - 16366.48] more enjoyable for people to enjoy
[16364.00 - 16368.28] absolutely because you know this is a
[16366.48 - 16370.32] huge thing for a restaurant to have such
[16368.28 - 16371.44] a clean menu and this might be a way
[16370.32 - 16373.48] that somebody might find out about
[16371.44 - 16375.72] medical medium information see the menu
[16373.48 - 16378.32] begin to heal be a great step into the
[16375.72 - 16379.60] whole you know world of medical medium
[16378.32 - 16380.84] wow I never thought of it like that but
[16379.60 - 16383.44] that's so true they might see it on the
[16380.84 - 16385.32] menu be like what is this and another
[16383.44 - 16387.44] way of people finding out about how to
[16385.32 - 16389.64] heal right yeah and realizing that
[16387.44 - 16391.52] Health isn't necessarily pills it's not
[16389.64 - 16392.52] necessarily you know hot yoga or
[16391.52 - 16394.36] something
[16392.52 - 16396.88] it's just simple food fruits and veggies
