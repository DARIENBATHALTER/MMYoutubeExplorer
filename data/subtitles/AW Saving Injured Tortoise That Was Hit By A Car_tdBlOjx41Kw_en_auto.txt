[1.00 - 4.52] this is really heartbreaking right here
[2.92 - 7.64] okay this is what happens when people
[4.52 - 10.64] don't pay attention and they run over
[7.64 - 12.52] tortoises and run over Turtles the prime
[10.64 - 16.24] example is why I try to save them every
[12.52 - 18.52] single day when I'm out and about and I
[16.24 - 21.56] have to get this this this guy right
[18.52 - 23.28] here to a Wildlife Reserve if possible
[21.56 - 26.80] I've already called one of
[23.28 - 31.12] them and uh nobody seemed to care so I
[26.80 - 34.32] have to call another one um but
[31.12 - 38.16] I have to get this guy the right the
[34.32 - 39.88] right things he needs and to protect him
[38.16 - 41.76] because this is this is just this is
[39.88 - 43.84] Criminal really this is Criminal I know
[41.76 - 46.04] people have accidents I know that they
[43.84 - 47.76] they do this by mistake a lot of people
[46.04 - 50.28] don't do it my by mistake they don't
[47.76 - 52.44] care they they have a disregard for
[50.28 - 54.96] animal life and they just run over
[52.44 - 57.00] tortoises and turtles and and they
[54.96 - 59.00] actually make a game of it I see it out
[57.00 - 61.72] there all the time and it's sick and
[59.00 - 65.36] it's delusional and um Despicable
[61.72 - 68.56] actually so this guy right here
[65.36 - 70.72] definitely going to put him in a box get
[68.56 - 73.36] him to a reserve somewhere and try to
[70.72 - 76.32] get him help because uh even though his
[73.36 - 80.44] survival rate
[76.32 - 83.20] is possibly you know possibly not not
[80.44 - 85.68] going to be what we wanted to be um his
[83.20 - 87.68] back legs are are partially
[85.68 - 89.44] paralyzed but we have to do something
[87.68 - 92.04] about it so I'm going to work on that
[89.44 - 95.56] right now already have uh some things in
[92.04 - 98.04] action right now and um and then I'm
[95.56 - 100.76] going to take care of I have I have a a
[98.04 - 103.36] box my trunk I'm going to go and get it
[100.76 - 105.88] I'm going to go and get it in a moment
[103.36 - 109.80] get him in the box and then see if I can
[105.88 - 111.72] Rush up to a place that we care for um
[109.80 - 115.00] but here he is right here he's
[111.72 - 118.44] struggling he was run over looks like a
[115.00 - 121.04] few hours ago the blood is drying on his
[118.44 - 124.40] back um
[121.04 - 126.72] truly heartbreaking truly truly
[124.40 - 129.64] heartbreaking anyway I'm just going to
[126.72 - 134.64] get working on trying to get this guy
[129.64 - 138.60] some attention immediately so signing
[134.64 - 140.80] off so I've already called four places
[138.60 - 145.84] waiting for responses I'm about to
[140.80 - 148.48] travel a distance as well but
[145.84 - 150.72] um but I want them to just be
[148.48 - 153.12] comfortable walk on the grass a little
[150.72 - 155.04] bit while I'm waiting for a response
[153.12 - 157.68] from somewhere but this is what what
[155.04 - 161.40] happens with Wildlife rescues you may
[157.68 - 163.68] not hear from them for a day or two but
[161.40 - 165.64] we just do the best we can and I'll have
[163.68 - 167.36] to be traveling a long distance and just
[165.64 - 170.72] searching so probably going to spend the
[167.36 - 173.36] next day maybe the next two days if he
[170.72 - 176.64] stays alive which you know God willing I
[173.36 - 180.04] hope hope he does
[176.64 - 182.64] so still on hold called eight emergency
[180.04 - 184.36] places Wildlife uh preserves and so
[182.64 - 187.68] forth still
[184.36 - 189.92] waiting um I just want to say this guy
[187.68 - 193.24] this is killing me at this point I'm
[189.92 - 196.84] hard I'm actually hard sick and
[193.24 - 200.36] um but he's got a lot of energy and a
[196.84 - 201.32] lot of strength left uh so has been
[200.36 - 205.32] talking to
[201.32 - 207.32] me um and I've been getting any kind of
[205.32 - 211.68] guidance from
[207.32 - 214.48] SSC um and so I'm on hold now I'm hoping
[211.68 - 215.20] that that this is that this is going to
[214.48 - 217.84] be
[215.20 - 220.80] fruitful and um but I'm just trying to
[217.84 - 224.64] keep them calm keep them
[220.80 - 227.64] safe uh I I want I want
[224.64 - 227.64] this
[227.84 - 235.04] um I want this to be a good
[231.08 - 238.44] experience where as much as he suffering
[235.04 - 243.12] he knows that we're trying to help and
[238.44 - 243.12] we want we want him to survive
