[0.15 - 5.07] the medical medium how is everybody out
[2.43 - 7.83] there I have Elizabeth Schaaf Roth right
[5.07 - 9.30] here with me she's an old friend and we
[7.83 - 12.90] didn't originally start out that way you
[9.30 - 14.31] came to me 10 years ago but liz is an
[12.90 - 16.53] amazing person she's here to tell her
[14.31 - 19.38] story about Lyme disease about how she
[16.53 - 21.48] struggled and suffered as a young woman
[19.38 - 23.31] because it's just it's really hard when
[21.48 - 26.01] it's when it's at that age especially
[23.31 - 29.40] and we're here she's a dear dear friend
[26.01 - 31.41] I'm really really lucky that I got her
[29.40 - 33.24] here right now with everything and and
[31.41 - 35.19] she's here she's gonna help out so many
[33.24 - 36.78] people because it's important to know
[35.19 - 38.64] about Lyme disease it's important to
[36.78 - 39.84] know about the truth about it about what
[38.64 - 43.17] people go through
[39.84 - 45.96] she has history that is it's priceless
[43.17 - 47.22] this history because you know it's
[45.96 - 49.77] different when you're diagnosed with
[47.22 - 52.92] Lyme disease today a lot different than
[49.77 - 55.95] it was 10 years ago 11 years ago 12
[52.92 - 58.29] years ago and I mean it's the dark ages
[55.95 - 62.01] now with Lyme disease it was the dark
[58.29 - 64.41] ages 10 12 years ago for real like even
[62.01 - 66.39] more so because there wasn't any any
[64.41 - 67.74] kind of I mean it wasn't even any kind
[66.39 - 69.24] of hope because science research didn't
[67.74 - 74.55] know laughs anyway have Elizabeth here
[69.24 - 76.74] I'm so happy thank you for coming on I'm
[74.55 - 81.72] so grateful you Anthony
[76.74 - 84.90] saved my life Anthony is unique from my
[81.72 - 87.60] personal experience I mean he shows
[84.90 - 89.55] unconditional love to people which I
[87.60 - 92.70] find was very hard to find in my
[89.55 - 96.99] experience with professionals and
[92.70 - 100.14] practitioners and he actually really
[96.99 - 103.41] cares about the person each individual
[100.14 - 105.33] each person and that is what compelled
[103.41 - 107.97] me to Anthony and from the first time I
[105.33 - 111.99] spoke to him on the on the phone I knew
[107.97 - 115.71] that he was someone that actually cared
[111.99 - 117.75] and didn't just you know just wasn't in
[115.71 - 120.63] it just was following a book or
[117.75 - 123.36] following a set of rules no Anthony has
[120.63 - 127.01] and he has the research to back it up
[123.36 - 130.17] and so I just want to thank Anthony for
[127.01 - 133.29] coming into my life I never you know I
[130.17 - 135.33] never saw it happening I just one day
[133.29 - 137.28] stumbled upon Anthony and he has changed
[135.33 - 140.25] my life think was a health food store -
[137.28 - 142.59] and it was like 2010 probably right
[140.25 - 144.51] right around that time so we're coming
[142.59 - 147.24] on ten years I think so that's what
[144.51 - 150.42] we're doing and but it's it's great to
[147.24 - 154.14] see you the vibrant and here and alive
[150.42 - 157.20] and well and safe and you know and I
[154.14 - 158.91] always I mean I think what were you 23
[157.20 - 163.11] when you came when you came to me
[158.91 - 168.15] originally so I was around 21 when I
[163.11 - 170.55] began having symptoms I was in college
[168.15 - 173.85] it was my third year of college and I
[170.55 - 177.63] woke up one day and I felt like a
[173.85 - 181.59] different person I was not the person
[177.63 - 184.08] that I was I had no energy no physical
[181.59 - 185.64] energy Coffee stopped working
[184.08 - 187.17] look I would have coffee every day and
[185.64 - 190.17] it would cut me up and make me feel
[187.17 - 191.52] great and it didn't happen - that
[190.17 - 193.50] happens at people when they're starting
[191.52 - 195.45] to get sick coffee's not cutting it or
[193.50 - 197.10] they need their coffee no matter what
[195.45 - 198.96] because they have something underlying
[197.10 - 200.61] and they just don't nobody knows about
[198.96 - 202.32] it yet and years could be where they
[200.61 - 203.91] have to have their coffee to function I
[202.32 - 206.25] want to talk about it later too because
[203.91 - 208.71] people like it's like why do you need
[206.25 - 210.78] your coffee to function I mean that
[208.71 - 212.34] means something's going on you know but
[210.78 - 212.82] you so the coffee just didn't cut it
[212.34 - 216.42] anymore
[212.82 - 218.73] I was so unwell that I just had no
[216.42 - 221.01] energy I had no physical energy I no
[218.73 - 224.31] mental energy and I had no idea what was
[221.01 - 226.26] going on with me and I had to I couldn't
[224.31 - 229.80] go to class I stopped attending classes
[226.26 - 231.33] I had no energy I couldn't I I had no
[229.80 - 233.61] idea what was going on so you're in
[231.33 - 235.35] college I'm in college you're not able
[233.61 - 237.36] to attend classes is that a big deal
[235.35 - 241.19] like that's a big deal right for a young
[237.36 - 244.41] woman you can't attend classes I can't
[241.19 - 246.33] and I'm not I'm feeling horrible I'm not
[244.41 - 248.07] feeling good I'm feeling really really
[246.33 - 251.37] bad I don't have energy I don't feel
[248.07 - 253.79] like myself I I'm like just it's so hard
[251.37 - 257.04] to get through the day and unfortunately
[253.79 - 259.50] I had to leave school in my third year
[257.04 - 260.91] and you know leave all my friends and
[259.50 - 262.74] leave everything and I went back to New
[260.91 - 265.90] York City which I'm originally from and
[262.74 - 271.03] that's when I started going to doctors
[265.90 - 273.13] to 40 doctors over the course of like so
[271.03 - 276.22] six years so it's like so it's like
[273.13 - 279.19] here's here's instead of just instead of
[276.22 - 281.05] college and friends and and planning on
[279.19 - 283.00] career and future and all this other
[281.05 - 285.04] stuff well you you we have to leave
[283.00 - 288.13] friends you have to leave college you're
[285.04 - 289.72] 21 years old and you have to now make
[288.13 - 292.24] your life about doctor's appointments
[289.72 - 294.52] and this is this is the whole you know
[292.24 - 296.77] when you came to me ten years ago you
[294.52 - 299.05] know I knew that was happening in
[296.77 - 301.48] people's lives but nobody talked about
[299.05 - 303.61] it they still don't talk about it I just
[301.48 - 305.11] did a recent podcast recently and I'm
[303.61 - 307.57] just sitting there talking about this
[305.11 - 310.81] stuff and people they look like deer in
[307.57 - 312.94] headlights like you know young women are
[310.81 - 314.71] really struggling with these conditions
[312.94 - 315.28] no one talks about that like okay life
[314.71 - 318.13] stops
[315.28 - 319.81] I mean how serious is that I mean for
[318.13 - 321.34] you was it like okay why is my life
[319.81 - 322.81] doctors appointments now how come
[321.34 - 326.38] there's no you know I had no other
[322.81 - 327.85] choice like so I just this is my life I
[326.38 - 330.28] have to go to doctors appointments I
[327.85 - 332.38] can't go to class I can't study I have
[330.28 - 333.99] to know I have to get better I had no
[332.38 - 337.78] other choice but to get better and
[333.99 - 340.06] doctors did not know no one knew what
[337.78 - 343.47] was going on with me I tried everything
[340.06 - 345.70] I tried every pill every treatment
[343.47 - 348.34] everything that I could find in regular
[345.70 - 352.30] conventional medicine and nothing helped
[348.34 - 354.67] me nothing with the doctors that you
[352.30 - 357.73] know I was going to and then one day a
[354.67 - 360.07] friend said why don't you go to a Lyme
[357.73 - 363.19] specialist a Lyme disease specialist and
[360.07 - 367.27] so I went to a Lyme disease specialist
[363.19 - 370.96] and they diagnosed me with Lyme disease
[367.27 - 373.93] and they said I had neuropsychiatric
[370.96 - 375.70] Lyme disease and which is when what
[373.93 - 378.91] which is when Lyme disease they believe
[375.70 - 385.48] is affecting your mood or your life or
[378.91 - 387.31] your your attitude your anxiety I was
[385.48 - 389.86] having brain fog you haven't the brain
[387.31 - 391.03] fog I was like brain fog is you know
[389.86 - 394.06] when you're just if you feel kind of
[391.03 - 395.71] spaced out and you don't know why you
[394.06 - 399.07] just you feel spaced out you don't
[395.71 - 401.77] really feel like yourself and rain
[399.07 - 403.66] brain fog is debilitating brain fog can
[401.77 - 406.42] literally stop people from functioning
[403.66 - 408.22] getting sentences out or being able to
[406.42 - 410.65] articulate be able to converse with
[408.22 - 412.78] people brain fog is brutal except people
[410.65 - 414.40] from working but I mean here you are 21
[412.78 - 418.54] years old you're dealing with severe
[414.40 - 419.92] brain fog and you're you're highly
[418.54 - 424.24] intelligent you're a highly intelligent
[419.92 - 426.43] person you're extremely sharp I've known
[424.24 - 429.40] you for 10 years your brilliant mind a
[426.43 - 431.47] brilliant person and and actually have
[429.40 - 434.08] to deal with that brain fog like that is
[431.47 - 440.92] brutal so so they diagnosed you with
[434.08 - 442.51] psychiatric Lyme aspects can don't quote
[440.92 - 446.04] me on it but a scan of my brain they
[442.51 - 448.90] said I had global brain inflammation and
[446.04 - 452.23] then I started the antibiotics and I
[448.90 - 455.86] started intravenous antibiotics I had a
[452.23 - 459.52] PICC line in my arm I was being you know
[455.86 - 462.64] everyday infused with antibiotics and it
[459.52 - 464.92] wasn't doing much of anything and I just
[462.64 - 467.08] believed in it I said it so it's got to
[464.92 - 470.77] get better I know it's the Lyme disease
[467.08 - 474.70] and then this was like years later so by
[470.77 - 478.60] now I'm in my mid to late 20s and I'm
[474.70 - 480.88] still struggling and I was one night I
[478.60 - 483.52] was in in a restaurant in New York City
[480.88 - 485.59] called Angelica's kitchen and I was
[483.52 - 488.08] leaving the restaurant and I see this
[485.59 - 489.73] magazine this health magazine and I'm
[488.08 - 494.50] skimming through it and I see Anthony
[489.73 - 496.12] and I'm like I felt an urge to call him
[494.50 - 498.76] I can't even describe what I felt that
[496.12 - 501.73] night out of nowhere I needed to call
[498.76 - 504.49] Anthony and I haven't know I had to call
[501.73 - 505.84] you like it was so weird like I don't go
[504.49 - 507.75] around calling people in health
[505.84 - 511.00] magazines it's not it's not my day today
[507.75 - 514.15] so I mean I go to these I go to some
[511.00 - 516.16] doctors but anyway the it was amazing so
[514.15 - 518.71] I called him and I was I remember it was
[516.16 - 521.89] 11 p.m. at night I was standing in bet
[518.71 - 524.41] Best Buy in New York City and Anthony
[521.89 - 526.12] called me back immediately and I told
[524.41 - 528.16] him what was going on which is something
[526.12 - 530.35] that doesn't happen that's another thing
[528.16 - 531.16] I have to wait months and months and
[530.35 - 532.51] months
[531.16 - 536.02] waiting list to get to see a line
[532.51 - 538.36] specialist for a year why so you can for
[536.02 - 540.40] what and you know and even me it was
[538.36 - 542.65] hard to get back to people fast I mean
[540.40 - 544.81] our office got back to people as quick
[542.65 - 546.61] as we could like immediately and I
[544.81 - 548.29] worked I worked day and night I mean I
[546.61 - 550.33] got four hours of sleep at night for
[548.29 - 551.68] seven days a week for a member like six
[550.33 - 553.87] or eight years straight without a half
[551.68 - 556.66] day off or a holiday but I remember when
[553.87 - 565.75] I got a hold of you you were surprised
[556.66 - 568.84] you were like what what's going on it's
[565.75 - 571.06] just funny and he basically said to me
[568.84 - 573.25] he said to me that you don't have Lyme
[571.06 - 575.89] disease I said what do you mean I don't
[573.25 - 578.86] have Lyme disease yes I do I thought I
[575.89 - 581.02] did he goes no and I believed him I was
[578.86 - 585.25] like you're right I don't have Lyme
[581.02 - 587.83] disease that's false yeah because I mean
[585.25 - 589.57] you didn't get bit by a tick no I warned
[587.83 - 591.43] I didn't have any recollection of a tick
[589.57 - 594.22] bite which is unbelievable some people
[591.43 - 595.69] do but even then you know still not Lyme
[594.22 - 597.55] because you guys are learning about Lyme
[595.69 - 598.99] now what's happening and everything
[597.55 - 600.91] anybody who doesn't know about the
[598.99 - 603.48] medical medium information Lyme disease
[600.91 - 605.77] has now moved out of the category of
[603.48 - 607.57] bacterial now so medical medium
[605.77 - 609.61] information allowed that to happen
[607.57 - 611.14] actually prompted and pushed the medical
[609.61 - 612.76] industry to change it they changed it
[611.14 - 614.14] because of the millions of books that
[612.76 - 615.70] got the truth out about Lyme disease
[614.14 - 617.32] Lyme disease is not bacterial if you're
[615.70 - 618.97] still stuck in that bacterium minded
[617.32 - 620.50] world of Lyme disease you're gonna be
[618.97 - 622.36] held back from getting better and it's
[620.50 - 623.62] gonna hold you back for a lifetime if
[622.36 - 625.72] you're not careful because it's not
[623.62 - 627.16] bacteria and the Lyme labs
[625.72 - 628.39] they've been bankrolling off of this
[627.16 - 630.76] because this is what they built their
[628.39 - 632.80] empires on they know to so what's
[630.76 - 634.48] happening is is is the world's changing
[632.80 - 636.34] now it's put in autoimmune so Lyme
[634.48 - 637.72] disease the medical industry took Lyme
[636.34 - 639.94] disease and they put it in autoimmune
[637.72 - 641.80] now which means they think the body is
[639.94 - 644.29] attacking itself and it wasn't bacteria
[641.80 - 645.55] so just so you know and with her when
[644.29 - 647.65] she came to me with all these symptoms
[645.55 - 649.84] and everything else and and all of that
[647.65 - 651.91] it wasn't Lyme disease it just wasn't
[649.84 - 653.26] you can call it that you can call it
[651.91 - 655.75] Lyme disease you can name it anything
[653.26 - 658.57] you want but it wasn't what was really
[655.75 - 660.52] happening and you know and I and I new
[658.57 - 660.88] to with you that you weren't bit by a
[660.52 - 662.47] tick
[660.88 - 663.97] and even when you're bit by a tick it
[662.47 - 665.26] doesn't mean that's Lyme disease and
[663.97 - 666.46] I got it you know the whole thing I
[665.26 - 667.84] remember we talked about it and
[666.46 - 669.94] everything I mean did you have a relief
[667.84 - 671.98] like a feeling of relief though oh I had
[669.94 - 674.95] a huge sense of relief because someone
[671.98 - 677.32] was actually you know I believed him
[674.95 - 678.34] completely and he said that it was
[677.32 - 681.10] something else
[678.34 - 683.56] Anthony told me that it was heavy metals
[681.10 - 685.84] and it was viral and that I had
[683.56 - 689.17] inflammation going on and that we had to
[685.84 - 691.33] address those factors and no one really
[689.17 - 695.11] would ever address what was actually
[691.33 - 696.85] going on with with the underlying you
[695.11 - 699.85] know the issue and I didn't know what it
[696.85 - 702.34] was yeah because for brain fog to happen
[699.85 - 703.51] you got to have mercury got to have
[702.34 - 705.70] toxic heavy metals like mercury
[703.51 - 707.11] everybody's got mercury in in them and
[705.70 - 709.03] if you guys don't think you have mercury
[707.11 - 711.94] in you it's not true you have mercury in
[709.03 - 714.34] you and and our ancestors do forefathers
[711.94 - 716.02] down the line all had mercury in them
[714.34 - 718.06] and mercury you know and what's
[716.02 - 719.83] happening now is young women are getting
[718.06 - 723.10] more sensitive to toxic heavy metals
[719.83 - 725.68] than ever before in our history and it's
[723.10 - 732.16] a cumulative effect to that's happening
[725.68 - 733.99] yeah and aluminum are not good obviously
[732.16 - 737.11] and they're you know they're neurotoxin
[733.99 - 738.94] and you know if you get enough mercury
[737.11 - 740.97] in enough aluminum and your body is
[738.94 - 744.25] sensitive force whatever Prieta
[740.97 - 746.53] predisposition you may have it's gonna
[744.25 - 749.11] trigger something and it's gonna set off
[746.53 - 751.12] a stream of things that that is not you
[749.11 - 754.87] and you need to start looking at what
[751.12 - 756.13] actually is going on what's causing you
[754.87 - 759.31] know you got to start getting those
[756.13 - 761.53] heavy metal metals out of you and slowly
[759.31 - 763.27] obviously and you talk about that so
[761.53 - 764.68] what happened we had the PICC line you
[763.27 - 768.19] were getting me antibiotics were you
[764.68 - 769.51] getting better no so the antibiotics
[768.19 - 771.43] weren't getting him better and that's a
[769.51 - 772.99] thing with Lyme disease because so you
[771.43 - 773.98] weren't you were you feeling sicker from
[772.99 - 779.17] the antibiotics
[773.98 - 780.73] I actually was feeling I was feeling a
[779.17 - 783.87] little bit yeah I was feeling sicker but
[780.73 - 785.95] I was feeling no different at all and
[783.87 - 788.86] you know I think that if I stayed I
[785.95 - 790.60] stayed on them and many much longer it
[788.86 - 793.54] could have been to the point where I
[790.60 - 795.76] could get I could have gone very sick
[793.54 - 796.78] yeah why did you stop them like what was
[795.76 - 797.80] it because we talked to her you just
[796.78 - 800.62] knew your
[797.80 - 804.52] it wasn't working and no because I spoke
[800.62 - 806.01] to you and you explained it in a
[804.52 - 808.51] different way I think I probably
[806.01 - 810.94] probably told you and I can't remember
[808.51 - 812.68] but I probably told you if you stand the
[810.94 - 815.98] antibiotics you're gonna go down the
[812.68 - 817.84] path when I watch 30 years of people
[815.98 - 819.67] diagnosed with Lyme disease getting
[817.84 - 821.56] bombarded with antibiotics and losing
[819.67 - 823.78] their lives and I know you were young
[821.56 - 825.94] and you just started them and I was like
[823.78 - 829.18] in this situation you're you're just
[825.94 - 832.27] gonna end up like the rest we can't let
[829.18 - 834.91] that happen I think I was probably you
[832.27 - 836.32] know really really charged about it
[834.91 - 837.85] because it was like wait a minute
[836.32 - 839.20] you know how old are you I just don't
[837.85 - 841.36] want to see you go through this now
[839.20 - 844.77] because that's what happens because we
[841.36 - 848.74] had thousands of people contact us women
[844.77 - 851.41] that were already down that the dark
[848.74 - 853.21] place of tons of antibiotics and their
[851.41 - 855.19] lives were shattered because of it
[853.21 - 857.53] because they weren't properly diagnosed
[855.19 - 860.26] about they weren't properly diagnosed
[857.53 - 862.24] about the viral issue they had the
[860.26 - 863.77] epstein-barr they had or anything else
[862.24 - 865.30] and they and they weren't properly
[863.77 - 868.09] diagnosed with the toxic heavy metals
[865.30 - 872.14] and their lives were shattered by this
[868.09 - 875.44] phantom bacterial thing which here's the
[872.14 - 878.65] thing Lyme bacteria is not a super bug
[875.44 - 880.75] it kills off easy from from from
[878.65 - 882.88] antibiotics it's not it's not MRSA
[880.75 - 884.86] people actually heal from Mercer with
[882.88 - 887.77] antibiotics and Merces antibiotic
[884.86 - 889.42] resistant and people recover I've seen
[887.77 - 890.80] people go in the hospital tumors to come
[889.42 - 893.26] out of hospital they recover because
[890.80 - 897.91] Merce is a super bug but it has a higher
[893.26 - 899.77] healing rate than Borrelia Babesia it's
[897.91 - 902.29] unbelievable then Bartonella it's
[899.77 - 903.73] unbelievable so what happens is my bar
[902.29 - 907.17] people with tremendous amounts of
[903.73 - 909.91] antibiotics it's not even about bacteria
[907.17 - 911.80] viruses don't get stopped from an
[909.91 - 913.51] antibiotic antibiotics make viruses
[911.80 - 915.61] worse that's why the Lyme community has
[913.51 - 917.50] suffered decade after decade have gotten
[915.61 - 919.90] worse and worse and it was like no Liz
[917.50 - 921.64] you know and at that point I didn't know
[919.90 - 923.53] you like you know like a best friend now
[921.64 - 925.60] but at that point I was like Liz no you
[923.53 - 928.36] can't go through this I can't watch you
[925.60 - 930.05] go through this but you were relieved to
[928.36 - 933.38] know that it wasn't
[930.05 - 935.84] there was I was relieved when I got the
[933.38 - 937.85] Lyme diagnosis I was hugely relieved I
[935.84 - 940.10] was like finally someone knows what's
[937.85 - 941.87] going on with me but when Anthony told
[940.10 - 943.88] me it wasn't Lyme there was no
[941.87 - 946.25] resistance for some reason I wasn't in
[943.88 - 949.13] there wasn't a need for me to hang on to
[946.25 - 951.68] it because I really understood what he
[949.13 - 954.47] was like everything he was saying made
[951.68 - 957.20] sense in a way that I that I don't
[954.47 - 959.72] doesn't make sense with other people
[957.20 - 963.56] that I've seen it's completely his
[959.72 - 965.47] knowledge is has research to back it up
[963.56 - 968.33] and he's dedicates his life to
[965.47 - 970.73] understanding underlying root causes of
[968.33 - 973.16] issues of illness well the research
[970.73 - 975.08] comes later what I when I when I told
[973.16 - 977.90] the world Hashimoto's thyroiditis many
[975.08 - 979.19] years ago and even published it and said
[977.90 - 981.31] that the Hashimoto's thyroiditis is
[979.19 - 982.85] caused by epstein-barr virus and
[981.31 - 985.25] fibromyalgia is caused by epstein-barr
[982.85 - 987.71] virus it came out later that they found
[985.25 - 990.56] a link with epstein-barr so the research
[987.71 - 992.39] comes later and that's what's always
[990.56 - 994.04] happy to work sure the research shows up
[992.39 - 995.45] and people say oh he must have got it
[994.04 - 998.06] from the research know the research
[995.45 - 999.74] guided for me that's the irony and it's
[998.06 - 1001.27] so crazy how that works and the same
[999.74 - 1002.95] thing with Lyme disease I've been saying
[1001.27 - 1004.99] it's viral all these years now they took
[1002.95 - 1006.37] it and put an autoimmune category now
[1004.99 - 1009.55] they're trying to phase out the
[1006.37 - 1011.29] bacterial energy about it all and
[1009.55 - 1012.76] doctors are swimming like they're
[1011.29 - 1014.23] swimming in a sea of confusion now
[1012.76 - 1015.73] doctors are like wait a minute I thought
[1014.23 - 1017.26] we were treating bacteria and then you
[1015.73 - 1018.88] get the old dogs left that are still
[1017.26 - 1020.11] treating bacteria but the new doctors
[1018.88 - 1022.21] now that are getting all the medical
[1020.11 - 1023.35] medium books all the new doctors that
[1022.21 - 1024.91] have them in their offices and
[1023.35 - 1027.40] everything they're treating it like
[1024.91 - 1029.26] viral now they're starting to because
[1027.40 - 1031.87] neurological Lyme is in the autoimmune
[1029.26 - 1033.94] category so it's really it's really
[1031.87 - 1035.62] amazing how millions of these medical
[1033.94 - 1038.41] medium books have been infiltrated
[1035.62 - 1040.60] doctor's office offices have gone into
[1038.41 - 1042.67] people's hands and it's changed what
[1040.60 - 1045.31] happened them the big mistake the Lyme
[1042.67 - 1047.20] mistake and I know a lot of the Lyme
[1045.31 - 1048.91] groups online don't understand this yet
[1047.20 - 1050.32] many of them do many of them I know that
[1048.91 - 1052.12] Medical meaning books were a dirty
[1050.32 - 1053.95] secret for a lot of people because they
[1052.12 - 1056.68] would get they would get like you know
[1053.95 - 1058.90] you know hassled if they got off the the
[1056.68 - 1060.85] road of it being bacterial but this is
[1058.90 - 1062.37] saving lives it's safe so many countless
[1060.85 - 1064.17] lives that when you're a girl
[1062.37 - 1066.33] you're 21 years old you're you know
[1064.17 - 1069.06] young woman you can't finish college or
[1066.33 - 1070.77] you're trying to struggle to do college
[1069.06 - 1072.39] and you're visiting 23 I mean how many
[1070.77 - 1075.12] doctors did you see like five doctors
[1072.39 - 1081.90] five doctors is a lot of doctors five
[1075.12 - 1084.06] doctors is a lot of doctors at least
[1081.90 - 1088.52] over the course of six years probably
[1084.06 - 1091.29] around 25 at least that's incredible I
[1088.52 - 1094.83] went I had I had no other option though
[1091.29 - 1101.46] because I was I was I was in unable to
[1094.83 - 1102.54] function so if I didn't for myself there
[1101.46 - 1104.88] would be no one because no one
[1102.54 - 1108.24] understood what was going on no one
[1104.88 - 1110.34] around me social media social media
[1108.24 - 1112.17] wasn't born you know what happens is
[1110.34 - 1114.03] like a lot of you guys you guys tell
[1112.17 - 1116.10] your stories you show your stories you
[1114.03 - 1117.66] show like your skin problems you show
[1116.10 - 1120.00] you talk about your chronic illness your
[1117.66 - 1121.59] neurological problems now you know young
[1120.00 - 1123.24] women are allowed to actually they're on
[1121.59 - 1124.71] social media even though it's still
[1123.24 - 1126.81] swept in the carpet even though it's
[1124.71 - 1129.81] still not taken seriously out there but
[1126.81 - 1132.12] it's still a platform this is like two
[1129.81 - 1135.18] thousand eight nine ten this was a
[1132.12 - 1137.13] really dark period for young women with
[1135.18 - 1139.23] with this kind of problem I mean it's
[1137.13 - 1140.91] you're you're a fighter that's how I see
[1139.23 - 1144.06] it you know you're a fighter and you're
[1140.91 - 1146.82] like okay yet you you you saw 25 doctors
[1144.06 - 1149.61] and you just I mean it's it's amazing
[1146.82 - 1151.65] yeah I just think about the people out
[1149.61 - 1153.78] there who don't you know are getting
[1151.65 - 1156.03] misdiagnosed I think that's the problem
[1153.78 - 1157.92] it's not just about Lyme it's kind of
[1156.03 - 1159.36] like you're being you're being diagnosed
[1157.92 - 1165.29] maybe it's the right diagnose but
[1159.36 - 1167.10] there's no there's no long-term like
[1165.29 - 1169.95] understanding of what's going on
[1167.10 - 1172.80] underneath of just giving someone a pill
[1169.95 - 1174.30] and Taotao and maybe the pill is a
[1172.80 - 1175.80] little bit helpful and that's good maybe
[1174.30 - 1177.51] you have to take the pill that's okay
[1175.80 - 1179.97] that's no problem if you have to take
[1177.51 - 1181.86] the pill but it's it's that there's no
[1179.97 - 1183.51] regard for anything else because they
[1181.86 - 1186.39] don't understand they don't they don't
[1183.51 - 1189.45] know what is going on yeah no it I
[1186.39 - 1193.23] totally I totally get it but I didn't I
[1189.45 - 1195.64] only lived it on on by seeing you know
[1193.23 - 1197.35] like your your struggle okay
[1195.64 - 1199.48] I lived it that way seeing others
[1197.35 - 1201.49] struggle over the years but I'm a I
[1199.48 - 1204.34] haven't lived it physically you know I
[1201.49 - 1206.53] haven't lived it on that level so I
[1204.34 - 1208.84] can't put myself in your shoes because I
[1206.53 - 1210.76] haven't lived that I haven't had you
[1208.84 - 1212.65] know where I was struggling like that
[1210.76 - 1214.63] you know physically with a lime
[1212.65 - 1217.81] diagnosis or anything else but I can't
[1214.63 - 1220.12] imagine what that's like when you're
[1217.81 - 1222.91] young when you're older it's hard oh my
[1220.12 - 1224.56] god women and 30s women are the forties
[1222.91 - 1227.44] women and the fifties it's it's it's
[1224.56 - 1230.32] hard but I can't imagine though I mean
[1227.44 - 1232.33] your life should not be disturbed
[1230.32 - 1235.66] it should not be kind of like
[1232.33 - 1237.64] roadblocked because you know you've got
[1235.66 - 1239.50] this diagnosis that the science of
[1237.64 - 1241.90] research has nothing no knows nothing
[1239.50 - 1244.51] about and that's the hard part for me
[1241.90 - 1245.92] it's like when you're healthy and you
[1244.51 - 1247.57] feel undestructible and nothing seems
[1245.92 - 1250.42] wrong science research seems to have all
[1247.57 - 1252.55] the answers but it kills me when I know
[1250.42 - 1255.31] that they don't have the answers but
[1252.55 - 1256.96] we're pretending they do and then your
[1255.31 - 1258.25] life stops because of it but what about
[1256.96 - 1260.26] all the other young women out there
[1258.25 - 1261.97] their lives stopped because of it
[1260.26 - 1264.49] because science research doesn't have
[1261.97 - 1267.67] that answer and so you know visiting
[1264.49 - 1269.29] doctors and and I mean you find out who
[1267.67 - 1271.12] your friends are and if you realize you
[1269.29 - 1273.43] can't keep up with what you you know and
[1271.12 - 1275.44] all of it it just it becomes difficult
[1273.43 - 1277.42] and yeah that's why I say you're a
[1275.44 - 1280.09] survivor of this and you're a survivor
[1277.42 - 1282.73] of it but you're still really young of
[1280.09 - 1285.31] course but you're a survivor of during
[1282.73 - 1288.85] that that dark period that was coming
[1285.31 - 1291.64] out of 2008 2009 2010 no social media
[1288.85 - 1293.53] kind of platform the lime groups weren't
[1291.64 - 1294.61] there for support there wasn't you know
[1293.53 - 1296.38] he whether they have the right
[1294.61 - 1299.20] information or not there wasn't any of
[1296.38 - 1301.69] that and you know you were in it alone
[1299.20 - 1303.75] is what I'm saying and yeah you found me
[1301.69 - 1307.36] but you were in it alone
[1303.75 - 1309.28] there's millions millions of other
[1307.36 - 1312.28] people out there going through this who
[1309.28 - 1316.12] are suffering and and there has to be
[1312.28 - 1318.91] more than just a surface topical
[1316.12 - 1321.16] solution to what's going on I feel that
[1318.91 - 1323.89] people need to realize if you're young
[1321.16 - 1325.39] out there and you're going through
[1323.89 - 1327.46] something and you don't know what it is
[1325.39 - 1328.93] and you you know the people around you
[1327.46 - 1329.59] are looking at you like what's wrong
[1328.93 - 1332.17] with her
[1329.59 - 1336.16] she's maybe she just doesn't want to do
[1332.17 - 1338.80] this maybe she's lazy you know just know
[1336.16 - 1341.86] that they're you there's nothing wrong
[1338.80 - 1345.04] with you and you just have a physical
[1341.86 - 1347.11] problem and it's not your your fault
[1345.04 - 1349.60] yeah and and it's not your body
[1347.11 - 1350.62] attacking itself because that's what the
[1349.60 - 1352.21] industry that's what science and
[1350.62 - 1353.59] research wants she didn't know they want
[1352.21 - 1354.88] you to know that your body is attacking
[1353.59 - 1356.35] itself that's what they really want you
[1354.88 - 1358.33] to they want you to believe I'm sorry
[1356.35 - 1359.50] that your body's destroying itself your
[1358.33 - 1362.98] immune system is destroying itself
[1359.50 - 1366.04] that's why they moved lime into
[1362.98 - 1367.24] autoimmune to is because not only was it
[1366.04 - 1371.08] a complete mystery and it's not
[1367.24 - 1373.24] bacterial but it's there because it
[1371.08 - 1375.13] falls into the category now of because
[1373.24 - 1376.72] Lyme people they have the Hashimoto's
[1375.13 - 1378.13] and they have the thyroid problems and
[1376.72 - 1379.30] they have skin problems they have all
[1378.13 - 1381.01] these other problems in the they're
[1379.30 - 1383.44] realizing they never even knew it Lyme
[1381.01 - 1384.73] was to begin with so they so they just
[1383.44 - 1387.01] now they're lumping it in to the
[1384.73 - 1389.80] autoimmune category they want women they
[1387.01 - 1393.88] want young women to know that their body
[1389.80 - 1396.82] is faulty and just and and it's
[1393.88 - 1398.80] destroying them and our genes are faulty
[1396.82 - 1400.69] their body's attacking itself they want
[1398.80 - 1402.73] them to know that now why do they want
[1400.69 - 1404.53] them to know that I don't have any idea
[1402.73 - 1406.24] the only thing I can come up with is
[1404.53 - 1407.80] science researchers likes to protect
[1406.24 - 1409.03] itself when it doesn't have the answer
[1407.80 - 1412.08] so if it doesn't have the answers it's
[1409.03 - 1415.57] going to protect itself over people but
[1412.08 - 1417.55] but the bottom line is it's like so
[1415.57 - 1419.11] you're in this position in your life
[1417.55 - 1421.18] you're a young woman you're going
[1419.11 - 1423.34] through this there's there's really
[1421.18 - 1426.55] you're in it alone that's how I see it
[1423.34 - 1429.07] because you're walking out of doctors
[1426.55 - 1431.65] offices you don't have an answer you're
[1429.07 - 1434.71] really sick I mean when I met you you
[1431.65 - 1437.83] were like you were you told me when I
[1434.71 - 1440.41] talked with you that you can't even get
[1437.83 - 1442.27] out of the house there was there was

[1464.78 - 1470.69] out of the house and it wasn't you know
[1467.69 - 1472.79] I mean so it doesn't matter if you you
[1470.69 - 1474.98] know whatever it's well when when you're
[1472.79 - 1476.81] young woman your your running track in
[1474.98 - 1479.18] high school you know that exercise
[1476.81 - 1481.34] because exercise is also a release
[1479.18 - 1482.96] it's like release it's a great release
[1481.34 - 1484.76] it can it can you know when you're
[1482.96 - 1486.77] stressed out that's how you can battle
[1484.76 - 1488.57] stress as a young person you're actually
[1486.77 - 1490.82] even an older person whatever you can
[1488.57 - 1492.86] you can you know you use exercise as a
[1490.82 - 1494.93] tool how they tool and stuff so here you
[1492.86 - 1497.39] can't exercise you have a history of
[1494.93 - 1500.12] running track that's that's a big deal
[1497.39 - 1501.47] and so and when I met you it's like I
[1500.12 - 1503.90] remember you on a you know you're on the
[1501.47 - 1507.05] phone and you were like Anthony I can't
[1503.90 - 1510.14] even I mean I can't even I can't the
[1507.05 - 1512.42] brain Fox so bad the fatigue is so bad I
[1510.14 - 1515.81] remember you telling me your weight was
[1512.42 - 1518.09] really really low like really low you
[1515.81 - 1520.94] could barely eat because you mean
[1518.09 - 1524.36] because you had no energy I mean it
[1520.94 - 1526.10] takes energy to get food to make food to
[1524.36 - 1531.05] eat food I mean all of it you were like
[1526.10 - 1533.63] you were like and and you know you you
[1531.05 - 1535.16] bore it really well I gotta say because
[1533.63 - 1538.03] when I was on the phone you were like
[1535.16 - 1540.35] you were just like what do I need to do
[1538.03 - 1543.11] that's it you're like what do I need to
[1540.35 - 1544.67] do and I get I get choked up about this
[1543.11 - 1545.45] because it broke my heart to see you in
[1544.67 - 1548.75] this condition
[1545.45 - 1552.38] and because I know I know who you really
[1548.75 - 1554.75] worry the one thing about how it works
[1552.38 - 1556.19] with my source and how I hear the voice
[1554.75 - 1558.80] I hear and the gift I have and
[1556.19 - 1562.79] everything is I know who you are as a
[1558.80 - 1564.41] person and and to know that you were
[1562.79 - 1566.48] suffering and struggling like this it
[1564.41 - 1568.19] just I broke my heart and I was like
[1566.48 - 1571.40] look you know we're gonna get you better
[1568.19 - 1573.44] and I mean and we were you were talking
[1571.40 - 1575.18] a lot we were you know connecting a lot
[1573.44 - 1578.27] to make sure you you were you at least
[1575.18 - 1580.13] knew your body wasn't your body you that
[1578.27 - 1583.04] you did have something going on it
[1580.13 - 1585.47] wasn't Lyme and we had to now go we had
[1583.04 - 1591.68] to go after the true problem and I
[1585.47 - 1594.56] remember then the spirulina came I think
[1591.68 - 1596.82] I consumed so much spirulina in that
[1594.56 - 1599.20] amount of time
[1596.82 - 1601.66] remember I have some right in here my
[1599.20 - 1603.73] heavy-metal detox movie but I remember
[1601.66 - 1606.85] coming home one day and there was
[1603.73 - 1610.90] spirulina all over my kitchen my cat had
[1606.85 - 1613.00] knocked down a glass bottle maybe the
[1610.90 - 1617.11] whole thing had exploded everywhere and
[1613.00 - 1618.94] I took me like weeks to clean it up I
[1617.11 - 1621.79] just had so much spirulina during that
[1618.94 - 1624.52] time and I was you know in cilantro
[1621.79 - 1625.90] I remembered juice I was juicing I was
[1624.52 - 1628.75] juicing all the time
[1625.90 - 1631.24] and it was so helpful for the brain fog
[1628.75 - 1634.36] especially huh oh my god the juicing
[1631.24 - 1635.71] yeah because you know what Happel I had
[1634.36 - 1637.39] somebody recently tell me like oh you
[1635.71 - 1639.19] just started this the other day your
[1637.39 - 1642.07] heavy metal detox movie are you kidding
[1639.19 - 1643.30] this is going all the way back 2010-2011
[1642.07 - 1643.93] and you're doing the spirulina and
[1643.30 - 1646.54] cilantro
[1643.93 - 1648.25] yeah because spirit always had this
[1646.54 - 1650.41] information going all the way back and
[1648.25 - 1652.57] that's a thing because it's that it's
[1650.41 - 1655.54] that I watched it help so much so the
[1652.57 - 1659.38] cilantro the spirulina those two alone
[1655.54 - 1661.03] were helping you and and I think I try
[1659.38 - 1664.27] to get you on the wild blueberries I
[1661.03 - 1667.00] think that was happening I think a lot
[1664.27 - 1671.02] of fruits because it was anti fruit then
[1667.00 - 1675.70] to fruit every few every hour I had to
[1671.02 - 1676.96] have a piece of fruit yeah and yeah but
[1675.70 - 1680.44] you were you were like you were like
[1676.96 - 1682.36] what do I need to do and I was like you
[1680.44 - 1685.48] got to do fruit because fruit kills
[1682.36 - 1687.43] pathogens and that information still
[1685.48 - 1689.26] isn't out there you can even surf surf
[1687.43 - 1691.48] around you YouTube and find all these
[1689.26 - 1693.07] professionals that are on there talking
[1691.48 - 1694.54] they're not they're not Pro fruit they
[1693.07 - 1696.94] don't think fruit does anything and it
[1694.54 - 1699.10] literally saves lives and that's the sad
[1696.94 - 1701.11] part about you know if your first time
[1699.10 - 1703.51] watching this learn this now and put
[1701.11 - 1706.12] your belief system aside and and
[1703.51 - 1707.53] actually learn but it's it's the fruit
[1706.12 - 1709.30] and I remember telling you know you got
[1707.53 - 1711.64] to do all this fruit and you were just
[1709.30 - 1713.59] like you're like you're just tough
[1711.64 - 1713.98] you're just like okay what do I got to
[1713.59 - 1717.31] do
[1713.98 - 1719.68] and you remember I remember and and it
[1717.31 - 1721.30] wasn't and you weren't afraid and I have
[1719.68 - 1725.26] to say that I understand when people are
[1721.30 - 1727.03] afraid I I understand that but but and
[1725.26 - 1728.51] and people are afraid when they're
[1727.03 - 1732.27] trying something
[1728.51 - 1734.67] isn't so popular like right now the
[1732.27 - 1738.96] world hates fruit so much for no reason
[1734.67 - 1741.24] and back then 2010 they hated it but it
[1738.96 - 1743.07] was a little easier to also do because
[1741.24 - 1744.69] it was like it wasn't so bad with so
[1743.07 - 1747.33] many professionals you know harping on
[1744.69 - 1749.55] fruit like they do now but it's like but
[1747.33 - 1751.38] you still did it and it was odd you were
[1749.55 - 1752.94] like you know meaning was odd that I
[1751.38 - 1754.47] would recommend that kind of fruit nice
[1752.94 - 1756.60] every hour you had to have it because
[1754.47 - 1759.87] your nervous system and this is the
[1756.60 - 1762.33] thing when you have a nervous system and
[1759.87 - 1764.01] it's a viral load causing the problem so
[1762.33 - 1765.78] with you was the up steam bar which
[1764.01 - 1767.52] everybody has if you don't think you
[1765.78 - 1769.23] have Epstein bar you're wrong it sits
[1767.52 - 1772.17] inside all of us and it'll waits for an
[1769.23 - 1774.39] opportunity whatever that might be you
[1772.17 - 1776.82] may accidentally get more heavy metals
[1774.39 - 1778.68] through some Avenue that that you know
[1776.82 - 1780.87] we research and we know where mercury is
[1778.68 - 1785.25] or other metals and lumina manned copper
[1780.87 - 1788.31] but we all have epstein-barr and young
[1785.25 - 1790.20] or old we all have it and it awaits to
[1788.31 - 1792.99] want to come out one day and wreak a lot
[1790.20 - 1796.14] of havoc and so you had the epstein-barr
[1792.99 - 1797.58] you had the mercury and the aluminum the
[1796.14 - 1799.44] epstein-barr feeds off the mercury in
[1797.58 - 1801.51] aluminum you get the brain fog you get
[1799.44 - 1804.23] the brains the brain inflammation you
[1801.51 - 1808.29] get the nerve inflammation and then
[1804.23 - 1809.88] that's that's where you were and and the
[1808.29 - 1812.34] fruit was so important because you
[1809.88 - 1813.99] needed you need a glucose for the nerves
[1812.34 - 1816.21] and the nervous system the nervous
[1813.99 - 1818.33] system runs on sugar
[1816.21 - 1820.47] another great mistake now you guys is
[1818.33 - 1822.45] everything's Kido Kido Kido I'm not
[1820.47 - 1825.42] making fun and Kido Kido has it has a
[1822.45 - 1826.74] some offers a lot of great stuff because
[1825.42 - 1828.63] it gets you off of processed foods and
[1826.74 - 1830.07] all this other junk and garbage so it's
[1828.63 - 1831.99] really good on that level but when
[1830.07 - 1836.04] you're really sick and you got real
[1831.99 - 1837.84] issues going on that's don't they they
[1836.04 - 1839.79] starve your nervous system they don't
[1837.84 - 1841.41] feed it so if you're somebody if you're
[1839.79 - 1843.30] a young woman dealing with Lyme in your
[1841.41 - 1845.13] neurological Lyme and all of that the
[1843.30 - 1846.96] last thing you want is to beat your fats
[1845.13 - 1849.50] to be threw off the chart and the high
[1846.96 - 1851.85] fat diet just because it's popular and
[1849.50 - 1853.23] you don't want that you want to make
[1851.85 - 1855.63] sure there's lots of sugar in your diet
[1853.23 - 1858.99] healthy natural sugar like steamed
[1855.63 - 1860.70] potatoes and and and I think I had you
[1858.99 - 1861.28] on steamed potato so I'm pretty sure at
[1860.70 - 1863.38] one point
[1861.28 - 1865.27] and fruits like the bananas and the
[1863.38 - 1867.55] blueberries and all this because it's
[1865.27 - 1869.95] sugars that revive and revitalize your
[1867.55 - 1872.50] nervous system when you're going through
[1869.95 - 1875.71] this inflammation in this neurological
[1872.50 - 1878.05] Lyme and if your first time seeing this
[1875.71 - 1881.47] just don't pooh-pooh it you take this
[1878.05 - 1884.80] advice she did and I mean did it save
[1881.47 - 1887.11] your life I mean so what I became just I
[1884.80 - 1889.93] was having a lot of digestive issues but
[1887.11 - 1893.46] severe constipation and things going on
[1889.93 - 1897.01] and the gut was the first thing to heal
[1893.46 - 1900.22] my gut my gut was the first thing to
[1897.01 - 1903.10] heal in a matter of weeks I was coming
[1900.22 - 1904.51] back to normal like it was unbelievable
[1903.10 - 1906.34] so you're on the phone with me and
[1904.51 - 1909.46] you're like and I remember that - you're
[1906.34 - 1911.92] like my stomach's getting better and and
[1909.46 - 1913.33] and now was huge for you because then
[1911.92 - 1917.17] you're like wait a minute I'm getting
[1913.33 - 1918.85] better yeah I couldn't believe that I
[1917.17 - 1921.22] was getting like I was feeling better
[1918.85 - 1923.14] like you know with my stomach and then I
[1921.22 - 1925.63] was slowly getting the you know anxiety
[1923.14 - 1927.73] was getting better the brain fog was
[1925.63 - 1929.98] getting better you know I still to this
[1927.73 - 1933.73] day have some some issues with with my
[1929.98 - 1937.71] energy levels residual issues because I
[1933.73 - 1942.19] I found Anthony later on unfortunately
[1937.71 - 1944.41] though oh yes I'm you but it's very you
[1942.19 - 1947.17] know it's very manageable like I'm hot
[1944.41 - 1948.94] you know it's nothing you got your you
[1947.17 - 1950.68] got global she has her global strays
[1948.94 - 1951.73] foundation because I want you to get a
[1950.68 - 1953.53] chance to talk about that for a minute
[1951.73 - 1955.60] cuz that's important because this is
[1953.53 - 1958.18] this is this is a big deal to me right
[1955.60 - 1961.39] here is here you are you recovered from
[1958.18 - 1964.99] something so that was so difficult and
[1961.39 - 1966.79] and you were suffering and because of
[1964.99 - 1967.69] recovering from that you're saving
[1966.79 - 1970.66] animals
[1967.69 - 1972.13] you're saving dogs which I have a love
[1970.66 - 1973.66] for dogs that's why I talk about it in
[1972.13 - 1976.48] the first book I have you know the
[1973.66 - 1979.54] storage story with August and and
[1976.48 - 1981.97] everything and and and dogs me in the
[1979.54 - 1983.23] world to me and they just do animals
[1981.97 - 1985.36] didn't mean the world to me - of course
[1983.23 - 1989.02] and so what happened is you're you're
[1985.36 - 1991.66] now doing this powerful work globally on
[1989.02 - 1993.22] saving dogs and it's called global
[1991.66 - 1994.69] strays and I want everybody to check
[1993.22 - 1996.91] that out its global straight
[1994.69 - 1998.98] and look into that if donate to it or
[1996.91 - 2000.72] whatever I don't know how its set up but
[1998.98 - 2002.43] you you know that's yeah you can make
[2000.72 - 2004.77] donations and so forth she can help out
[2002.43 - 2009.21] animals but she's she's running that
[2004.77 - 2010.65] that's and and but yeah so also when I
[2009.21 - 2012.00] got better I was able to go back to
[2010.65 - 2014.45] school I always wanted to study
[2012.00 - 2017.39] photography and I was able to become a
[2014.45 - 2019.80] photojournalist for a few years and then
[2017.39 - 2022.29] in New York City which I absolutely
[2019.80 - 2025.17] loved I loved I loved photojournalism
[2022.29 - 2028.77] and I still do love it and but I was
[2025.17 - 2030.69] gravitated towards helping animals and
[2028.77 - 2032.49] the people that were rescuing animals in
[2030.69 - 2035.85] parts of the world were there is very
[2032.49 - 2038.13] little help for animal welfare issues so
[2035.85 - 2040.17] I travel to parts of the world Central
[2038.13 - 2042.69] America and I saw there was an
[2040.17 - 2045.96] overpopulation crisis of animals
[2042.69 - 2049.50] everywhere horses dogs cats everywhere
[2045.96 - 2051.96] and it was astounding to me that nothing
[2049.50 - 2053.94] was being done to control the population
[2051.96 - 2056.58] to help these animals and I started
[2053.94 - 2058.41] meeting with animal rescuers who were
[2056.58 - 2058.83] doing incredible work but they had no
[2058.41 - 2061.50] help
[2058.83 - 2064.86] they had no outside donations so that's
[2061.50 - 2068.10] how I began global streams began to
[2064.86 - 2070.98] develop it was the need to help people
[2068.10 - 2073.80] who had no help and they wanted to help
[2070.98 - 2076.50] animals and we're helping horses we're
[2073.80 - 2079.35] helping dogs were helping cats in a
[2076.50 - 2081.93] different and not just in in rescuing
[2079.35 - 2084.66] one one animal at a time we help
[2081.93 - 2086.79] families with veterinary care who cannot
[2084.66 - 2089.55] afford veterinarian care for their pets
[2086.79 - 2092.19] incredible so when we do say neutering
[2089.55 - 2094.65] and educational program so people can
[2092.19 - 2097.05] understand more about the love of the
[2094.65 - 2100.38] love for animals and why animals are
[2097.05 - 2102.21] important animals have also changed they
[2100.38 - 2105.45] have the animals help me they support me
[2102.21 - 2108.03] emotionally I mean my dogs are there my
[2105.45 - 2110.67] therapy now my therapy with everything
[2108.03 - 2113.07] going on and you know it's it's such a
[2110.67 - 2114.78] critical part of my life so I know it's
[2113.07 - 2116.43] part of you know cats and dogs and
[2114.78 - 2118.83] horses and they're a part of everybody's
[2116.43 - 2122.10] life so many people out there so while
[2118.83 - 2124.38] she's doing incredible work me and and
[2122.10 - 2126.21] she she healed to do that so you feel
[2124.38 - 2127.83] like you feel like you know you're it's
[2126.21 - 2130.02] manageable now like
[2127.83 - 2132.51] you can you can work you even went back
[2130.02 - 2135.75] to school and it's manageable completely
[2132.51 - 2138.21] manageable I'm living wonderful life and
[2135.75 - 2139.83] I mean there's no obviously there's days
[2138.21 - 2141.42] that sometimes it comes a little bit of
[2139.83 - 2143.49] it comes back and I have to take more
[2141.42 - 2146.79] supplements and I have to you know and
[2143.49 - 2150.18] you can't you know but I'm unable to do
[2146.79 - 2152.52] what I what I couldn't do without that's
[2150.18 - 2154.08] incredible that's incredible what were
[2152.52 - 2157.59] some of the other supplements that I had
[2154.08 - 2160.08] you on the zinc e 12 b12 because the b12
[2157.59 - 2162.72] is critical and if you don't just get
[2160.08 - 2166.26] any b12 the best b12 is the benarjee
[2162.72 - 2167.61] calm I gave some way in a giveaway I
[2166.26 - 2169.59] purchased some and gave someone a
[2167.61 - 2172.41] giveaway recently so it's of energy v as
[2169.59 - 2175.05] in Victor I am ERG why energy outcomes
[2172.41 - 2176.94] so they're b12 is key and because it's a
[2175.05 - 2179.04] special blend it's a quality and
[2176.94 - 2181.47] everything but b12 is imperative for
[2179.04 - 2183.51] your nervous system and what happens is
[2181.47 - 2185.31] with people when they have neurological
[2183.51 - 2186.87] Lyme or any kind of nervous system
[2185.31 - 2188.43] diagnosis whether it's fibromyalgia
[2186.87 - 2191.43] whether it's any anything
[2188.43 - 2192.87] and whether it's CFS you know mecfs
[2191.43 - 2195.66] whatever it might be that you got a
[2192.87 - 2197.76] diagnosis of what happens is that your
[2195.66 - 2199.59] b12 might be high at the doctor's office
[2197.76 - 2201.93] and they don't know you still need it
[2199.59 - 2203.91] that you can't go by that reading on
[2201.93 - 2205.44] your bloodwork that your b12 is high and
[2203.91 - 2207.51] you don't need any b12 it's a great
[2205.44 - 2209.01] mistake great mistake at the doctor's
[2207.51 - 2210.21] office it's not the doctors fault for
[2209.01 - 2212.01] not knowing these things they're not
[2210.21 - 2213.36] gonna have a source of then they're not
[2212.01 - 2215.13] gonna have a source that can provide
[2213.36 - 2217.53] them the information like I do they're
[2215.13 - 2220.62] just not so what happens is the b12
[2217.53 - 2223.35] critical for your recovery and you know
[2220.62 - 2226.50] and and and zinc's another one to zinc
[2223.35 - 2227.88] is critical for recovery because of the
[2226.50 - 2229.56] viral issue so when you have
[2227.88 - 2231.93] neurological Lyme or any kind of Lyme
[2229.56 - 2234.24] disease diagnosis whatever it is you
[2231.93 - 2236.82] need zinc because it's your defense
[2234.24 - 2240.00] that's your defense against the viral
[2236.82 - 2241.56] issues that created and and the people
[2240.00 - 2243.09] with with Lyme disease they'll have the
[2241.56 - 2245.37] heavy metals too toxic heavy metals
[2243.09 - 2247.55] whether they know it or not and they'll
[2245.37 - 2249.60] have the pathogen the epstein-barr
[2247.55 - 2250.89] epstein-barr and shingles they'll have
[2249.60 - 2254.31] either both of those yours was
[2250.89 - 2256.41] epstein-barr and and so it's important
[2254.31 - 2257.58] to know that but you you say you still
[2256.41 - 2259.41] it's good you still take your
[2257.58 - 2260.21] supplements though it's still because
[2259.41 - 2261.89] you have
[2260.21 - 2266.81] - and you still eat pretty good right
[2261.89 - 2269.24] yes definitely I when I eat gluten is if
[2266.81 - 2271.28] I ever return to gluten that's when I
[2269.24 - 2274.70] noticed my symptoms start to come back
[2271.28 - 2276.47] so I have to stay gluten free that's
[2274.70 - 2278.60] been one of the most helpful things with
[2276.47 - 2280.16] the gut especially yeah I just felt
[2278.60 - 2281.57] right away better when I took you
[2280.16 - 2284.03] personally when I took luta now
[2281.57 - 2285.44] everyone's different but that was you're
[2284.03 - 2287.21] gonna be sensitive to the things that
[2285.44 - 2289.34] were that we're causing trouble at the
[2287.21 - 2292.01] beginning meaning like you had the viral
[2289.34 - 2294.83] issue you had the heavy metals and then
[2292.01 - 2296.96] anything that that like gluten and dairy
[2294.83 - 2300.20] products if you do too many of those you
[2296.96 - 2302.51] can get sensitive again because because
[2300.20 - 2304.25] they get in the way of the body's
[2302.51 - 2305.93] healing mechanisms they get in the way
[2304.25 - 2308.09] of the body healing and everything so
[2305.93 - 2310.43] I'm really proud of you for for doing
[2308.09 - 2318.28] that and we got some celery juice in
[2310.43 - 2318.28] front of us but hopefully doesn't spill
[2327.37 - 2332.84] it's a it's a gentle anti-inflammatory
[2330.26 - 2334.79] it's really amazing it's antiviral it's
[2332.84 - 2337.55] it's so it's it's a great one I love
[2334.79 - 2339.74] tumeric - I mean vitamin C when the
[2337.55 - 2341.18] vitamin C gotta have vitamin C if you're
[2339.74 - 2345.32] dealing with Lyme disease vitamin C's
[2341.18 - 2346.76] critical and you you want to be generous
[2345.32 - 2349.49] with your vitamin C you want to make
[2346.76 - 2350.72] sure you're doing an ester see that's
[2349.49 - 2353.00] number one
[2350.72 - 2355.07] the Vemma G ester C is the best the
[2353.00 - 2357.79] medical medium vitamin C shock therapy
[2355.07 - 2360.26] is incredible for people dealing with
[2357.79 - 2362.36] Lyme disease dealing with any kind of
[2360.26 - 2364.55] diagnosis that's confusing autoimmune
[2362.36 - 2366.83] diagnosis of any kind because autoimmune
[2364.55 - 2368.21] any autoimmune diagnosis is viral you
[2366.83 - 2370.67] just need to know that's the only way
[2368.21 - 2372.17] you're gonna learn and if you've heard
[2370.67 - 2374.00] that before out there it comes
[2372.17 - 2375.95] originally from the medical medium
[2374.00 - 2378.50] information and books so just know where
[2375.95 - 2380.12] it originates from so doctor toll tells
[2378.50 - 2381.50] you it's viral that autoimmune that
[2380.12 - 2383.36] originates from medical medium
[2381.50 - 2386.09] information know where the source comes
[2383.36 - 2388.27] from but but I'm just proud of you
[2386.09 - 2390.89] because I'm honestly you've always
[2388.27 - 2393.05] you've always taken care of yourself
[2390.89 - 2394.07] since then - you didn't just get better
[2393.05 - 2395.63] and throw it
[2394.07 - 2397.61] you know you didn't get better and just
[2395.63 - 2401.02] throw it all away I've gotten people a
[2397.61 - 2404.66] lot of people have gotten better and
[2401.02 - 2407.42] pulled them out of a dark space and they
[2404.66 - 2409.67] just kind of they forget what got them
[2407.42 - 2411.02] there meaning like doing all the good
[2409.67 - 2412.49] things and stuff so you always have
[2411.02 - 2415.22] these tools here and you're always using
[2412.49 - 2416.99] them and know better and it's amazing
[2415.22 - 2418.67] you know and I'm really proud of you for
[2416.99 - 2423.86] that it's incredible
[2418.67 - 2426.17] so overall like she say you know you
[2423.86 - 2430.61] learned how to heal you learned what the
[2426.17 - 2432.83] answer was it was a great relief to know
[2430.61 - 2434.99] you you actually had something else that
[2432.83 - 2438.50] you can pinpoint that was wrong like a
[2434.99 - 2439.94] real the real cause do you think that's
[2438.50 - 2441.17] gonna help out a lot of other people out
[2439.94 - 2447.71] there when they know that there's these
[2441.17 - 2451.31] other real causes other other things
[2447.71 - 2453.71] that could be going on yeah yeah it's
[2451.31 - 2456.35] important if you get if you got a lot if
[2453.71 - 2458.30] you get locked into a certain belief you
[2456.35 - 2461.21] got to be careful like if you're being
[2458.30 - 2463.61] told one thing is the one thing I notice
[2461.21 - 2464.96] is is that with the medical medium
[2463.61 - 2466.88] information is always controversial
[2464.96 - 2470.36] because it goes against all of the
[2466.88 - 2472.55] trendy money-making things like Lyme is
[2470.36 - 2474.56] a is a moneymaker it's stood out there
[2472.55 - 2476.30] so what it is if you go against what
[2474.56 - 2478.28] they're trying to do then you know you
[2476.30 - 2480.41] look like you don't have the answer but
[2478.28 - 2482.42] they all have the answer be cautious on
[2480.41 - 2485.09] all those very things because that's how
[2482.42 - 2488.57] it works we get sucked into these trendy
[2485.09 - 2491.00] trendy protocols diagnoses and all the
[2488.57 - 2493.46] stuff out there these trendy ways of
[2491.00 - 2494.90] that things are handled or created we
[2493.46 - 2497.66] got to look out for that stuff because
[2494.90 - 2499.43] it can block you what happens is you
[2497.66 - 2501.38] know you get diagnosed with Lyme disease
[2499.43 - 2504.29] you get told it's bacterial you get
[2501.38 - 2506.36] thrown on antibiotics and you just you
[2504.29 - 2508.10] feel like that's just the way it's gotta
[2506.36 - 2509.60] be but it doesn't have to be that way
[2508.10 - 2512.39] there's answers what I mean is you have
[2509.60 - 2515.96] to be open you something inside of you
[2512.39 - 2518.24] were like no this is I mean is that is
[2515.96 - 2520.88] that angelic intervention I don't know
[2518.24 - 2523.28] you just knew and just knew at the time
[2520.88 - 2525.65] meaning like you know you were just like
[2523.28 - 2527.84] you just knew you had to call me because
[2525.65 - 2529.25] that's funny because so
[2527.84 - 2531.53] people when they say that they'll be
[2529.25 - 2533.99] like I don't know how it happened but it
[2531.53 - 2535.79] just it just did and I'm just blown away
[2533.99 - 2537.92] that you know I'm just blown away become
[2535.79 - 2542.06] friends we've become close friends all
[2537.92 - 2544.91] these years and I didn't think I back
[2542.06 - 2546.49] when I met you in 2010 okay
[2544.91 - 2550.22] I didn't think we'd be sitting here
[2546.49 - 2551.54] right here and doing this this is this
[2550.22 - 2554.99] just blows me away
[2551.54 - 2557.48] I never thought that ever like if you
[2554.99 - 2559.04] told me that then what do you talk about
[2557.48 - 2562.54] we're gonna be sitting you know what I
[2559.04 - 2566.69] mean we you know but it's incredible um
[2562.54 - 2568.16] and so overall every day your energy
[2566.69 - 2580.34] still feels pretty good you're still
[2568.16 - 2582.83] feeling like you know obviously not do
[2580.34 - 2584.72] you run into people do you know anybody
[2582.83 - 2586.31] that's dealing with Lyme do you ever run
[2584.72 - 2587.54] into people over the years do you know
[2586.31 - 2606.89] anybody that's dealing with other
[2587.54 - 2608.02] conditions so I encourage them to to
[2606.89 - 2614.71] read your books
[2608.02 - 2618.44] yeah actually alternative perspective
[2614.71 - 2621.22] yeah so every book I started with your
[2618.44 - 2625.67] first book yeah and that really goes
[2621.22 - 2629.15] pretty much yeah yeah has the Lyme story
[2625.67 - 2631.19] right there exactly and you can learn
[2629.15 - 2633.41] about Lyme and the truth about Lyme and
[2631.19 - 2635.45] everything um please know that I don't
[2633.41 - 2637.55] do consultations if you're if you're
[2635.45 - 2639.68] you're you're trying to reach me for
[2637.55 - 2641.00] that I actually did the books purposely
[2639.68 - 2642.77] the waiting lists of people were in the
[2641.00 - 2645.80] millions by the time I published his
[2642.77 - 2649.07] first book but the answers are here to
[2645.80 - 2652.28] heal you don't have to see me in water
[2649.07 - 2655.07] to heal the the answers are like what
[2652.28 - 2658.35] we're giving now we're here while we're
[2655.07 - 2661.51] doing this this is the whole point
[2658.35 - 2661.51] [Music]
[2661.79 - 2667.40] and changing the diet and really giving
[2664.22 - 2669.32] it a chance with the diet change yeah
[2667.40 - 2671.87] and I know it's really really hard it's
[2669.32 - 2676.58] not easy though it's not easy but but
[2671.87 - 2678.80] what's what's harder what's that's
[2676.58 - 2681.23] harder yeah hardest thing sick I love
[2678.80 - 2684.89] that and you know because it's true I
[2681.23 - 2687.08] mean it's like I don't know but look I
[2684.89 - 2688.73] wasn't sick like you in the sense with
[2687.08 - 2689.93] the neurological I'm I haven't suffered
[2688.73 - 2693.71] in that level
[2689.93 - 2696.77] I suffer from from just the the the
[2693.71 - 2698.78] hearing spirit that's not fun and not
[2696.77 - 2700.07] being able to do live a normal life
[2698.78 - 2701.84] because of it you know throughout my
[2700.07 - 2704.51] life but that's you know my story in
[2701.84 - 2707.09] here but the point is is that I haven't
[2704.51 - 2710.96] been in that trench myself personally
[2707.09 - 2713.27] and I just I all I know is I can't
[2710.96 - 2715.49] imagine what you went through and you
[2713.27 - 2717.92] know I am NOT going to pretend I can
[2715.49 - 2720.29] because I've never felt that kind of
[2717.92 - 2723.08] fatigue and that brain fog and I never
[2720.29 - 2725.78] had to go to 50 doctors for some people
[2723.08 - 2727.91] and 25 doctors ten doctors five doctors
[2725.78 - 2729.47] is too much and I've never had to do
[2727.91 - 2733.46] anything like that so I can't imagine
[2729.47 - 2735.32] but all I can tell you is that I I feel
[2733.46 - 2737.39] you and I believe you know what you've
