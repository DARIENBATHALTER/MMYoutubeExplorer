120

forewarning you the blue juice is very

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:02,940
blue that means the anthocyanins are so

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,940
powerful they will create an anthocyanin

123
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,380
color on your cutting board or anything

124
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,840
else so I'm just giving you the

125
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,139
forewarning right there

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,479
but it's that blue color that deep rich

127
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,139

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,779
of the wild blueberries that's a big

280
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,720
deal the survival of the wild

281
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,839
blueberries thousands upon thousands of

282
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,959
years these wild blueberries have been

283
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:15,500
here and what's incredible about them

284
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,500
is that it's not one species

285
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,040
it's hundreds

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,660
so when you look at a wild Blueberry

287
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,240
Field

288
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,300
it's not one

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,000
Gene you're looking at you're not

290
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,700
looking at one gene

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,220
you're looking at hundreds

292
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,640
of different genes

293
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,399
you're looking at a plant species that

294
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,380
survived because of hundreds of

295
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,040
different genes

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,839
that means that the blueberry this is so

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,399
incredible about the blueberry okay so

298
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,560
here it is the juice here's the white

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
blueberries right here

300
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,540
now

301
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,399
information is collected within the wild

302
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,660
blueberry plant

303
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,480
Century after Century after century

304
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,459
okay the Ice Age

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,920
they survived

306
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,339
okay flooding

307
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,480
everything they survived drought they've

308
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,579
survived

309
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,180
but they survived

310
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,920
because of the different genes that's a

311
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,360
whole nother thing too with this plant

312
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,420
species it's not one Gene and one plant

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,120
but yet it looks all the same

314
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,440
and the berries look the same when you

315
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,940
look at them you're like whoa that's a

316
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,560
wild blueberry that's a wild blueberry

317
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,480
plant you've got a wild Blueberry field

318
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,459
but yet

319
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,620
each plant

320
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,220
they're different than the other plant

321
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,160
it's their survival mechanism it's part

322
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,860
of how they survived all these thousands

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,200
of years each plant

324
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,860
has survival information in it going

325
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,180
back tens of thousands of years now a

326
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,820
lot of people they're like they love to

327
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:08,100
hear about ancient anything ancient

328
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:10,440
medicine ancient food ancient man right

329
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,620
and when we think about that

330
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,260
these blueberries which are wild wild

331
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,279
food have been here going all the way

332
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,279
back so any time a civilization was here

333
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,440
on this planet one way or another

334
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,720
whatever you believe whether it was the

335
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,180
first human being on this planet

336
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,579
these wild blueberries were here and

337
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,560
information was gathered

338
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,079
throughout the process of Life on this

339
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,240
planet information inside these wild

340
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,240
blueberries and these plants so that

341
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,240
information is all about survival

342
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,500
it's all about staying alive it's all

343
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,360
about protecting the person who is going

344
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,240
to consume them

345
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,180
and that's how you have to see it

346
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,420
this wild food has been here for Bears

347
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,300
to come and graze on for deer to come

348
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,779
and graze on for thousands of years

349
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,459
and then animals that are extinct that

350
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,100
aren't here anymore because the Earth

351
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,160
changed and the animals

352
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,100
died and dissipated and became extinct

353
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,720
but the wild blueberry stayed and

354
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,480
powered through

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,839
but they were here for all of these

356
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,360
centuries and thousands of years

357
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,240
for animals that have changed on this

358
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,160
planet to feed off of and humans that

359
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,899
have changed on this planet to feed off

360
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,959
of two

361
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:40,980
so these wild blueberry plants have seen

362
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,720
a lot a lot of history they've seen the

363
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,000
Earth change they've seen different

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,000
animals come and go

365
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,839
for thousands of years and all of that

366
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,519
information of survival stays inside the

367
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,480
plant

368
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,720
and it's there so when you actually have

369
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,079
that wild blueberry juice or you have

370
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,720
the wild blueberries it gets into you

371
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,199
that's that information goes into your

372
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,139

just some of them have and they're drunk

413
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,740
what happens when

414
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,420
baby chicks drink wild blueberry juice

415
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,860
they really get [ __ ] faced really

416
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,199
quickly and they run around and

417
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,680
they do all kinds of stuff and at AWS

418
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
Bar and Grill

419
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,699
like they're in the bathroom

420
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,559
okay

421
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,059
you guys get too drunk

422
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,919
all right so let's keep on going let's

423
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,020
talk about this a little bit

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,220
now when it comes to food people say

425
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,439
well food

426
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,959
you know food is everything food is

427
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,600
everything it really is depending on

428
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,720
what kind of food we're talking about

429
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,900
so if we're talking about a wild food

430
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,100
it's an entirely different story a wild

431
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,880
food

432
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,460
is different than a non-wild food so a

433
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,059
regular blueberry won't Harbor

434
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,059
a fraction of what's in a wild blueberry

435
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:43,620
it's two different things they're worlds

436
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:46,020
apart a cultivated blueberry will die if

437
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,059
you don't take care of it

438
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,160
so if you're a farmer and you got

439
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,960
cultivated blueberries you gotta water

440
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,679
them

441
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,679
they won't survive without water

442
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,900
right you have to you have to make sure

443
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,539
all the conditions are right you got to

444
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,580
make sure you feed them you got to make

445
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,200
sure you fertilize them

446
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,419
you got to make sure all of it when it's

447
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
a cultivated blueberry

448
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:15,960
when it's a wild blueberry

449
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,059
it has strength it can handle drought

450
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,799
and survive

451
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:27,000
you know a friend of mine years ago

452
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:30,780
um had a cultivated blueberry farm and

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,260
people would come and pick blueberries

454
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,419
and then what happened was

455
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,000
he had a bad year

456
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:41,760
there was no rain so he had to water

457
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,440
them but he couldn't water them because

458
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,020
his well wasn't working because his well

459
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,340
dried up so he couldn't get any water to

460
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,260
that Blueberry Field

461
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,260
and the blueberry Fields started dying

462
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,419
and then the next year only some came

463
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,880
back and then the next year only some

464
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,559
came back eventually he gave up on it

465
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,140
because it took a lot of work

466
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,020
it would be a lot of fertilizer a lot of

467
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,480
feeding a lot of consistent watering so

468
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,419
as time went on he checked out his

469
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,240
Blueberry field and literally not one

470
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,700
cultivated blueberry plant survived and

471
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,220
was left not one

472
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,580
because the cultivated blueberry is weak

473
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,299
that's why extremely weak

474
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,640
so blueberries are not the same if it's

475
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,400
cultivated versus Wild

476
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,700
they're two different species all

477
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,340
together two different species one's

478
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,080
weak yeah it's good for you it's still

479
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,240
good for you to eat a regular blueberry

480
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,539
you open up the clam shell you go to the

481
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,419
store you see that big blueberry

482
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:49,260
now what you'll notice too is with that

483
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:53,400
cultivated blueberry it's whiter inside

484
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,799
it's clear inside more of that there's

485
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,200
less anthocyanin on that cultivated

486
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,240
Bluebird that's what I've noticed that's

487
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,640
what I've seen in my life I've I've

488
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,700
actually purchased a lot of cultivated

489
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,860
blueberries and I've really studied them

490
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,160
and I've really analyzed them

491
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,100
and then I picked a lot of wild

492
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,020
blueberries in my time in my day I

493
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,620
remember laying in the wild blueberry

494
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,380
fields at that incredible moment at that

495
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,220
time of year and I've picked so many of

496
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,620
them

497
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,020
and I've experimented with them and I've

498
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,960
cut them open and I've like really done

499
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,299
my own work with blueberries and wild

500
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,299
blueberries and I noticed that the wild

501
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,940
blueberry has a lot more blue going on

502
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,220
it bleeds into the blueberry when you

503
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,080
actually cut it there's more

504
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,940
anthocyanins

505
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,980
and that's what's incredible all its own

506
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,299
that's what I've seen there's more of

507
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,640
that blue so like the cultivated

508
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:57,120
blueberry the big old one in the clam

509
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,640
shell is kind of like the white bread

510
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,679
version of a blueberry that's what it

511
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,679
kind of is it's got like the white bread

512
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,780
you know and versus whole wheat I'm not

513
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,220
saying whole wheat or white bread or

514
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,480
whole wheat or processed bread it's good

515
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm not saying any of that I'm just

516
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,360
saying that cultivated blueberry when

517
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,780
you crack it open it's kind of empty

518
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,179
that's what I've seen it's not the wild

519
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,799
food the wild blueberry all on its own

520
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,320
so these are important things to know

521
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,179
people don't know this information they

522
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,120
think that all blueberries are the same

523
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,440
like okay okay yeah okay okay let me go

524
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,299
and they go to the store and they just

525
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
get the cultivated blueberry like I got

526
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:38,039
my blueberries I'm doing it in here I'm

527
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,919
doing my hmds and it's like no you're

528
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,020
not you're not doing it

529
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,600
if you're using that cultivated

530
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,820
blueberry so now if you can't get a hold

531
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,799
of a wild blueberry and you don't have

532
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,659
access to the wild blueberry juice or

533
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,840
anything like that if you don't have

534
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,400
access then use a Blackberry over your

535
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,080
regular cultivated believer get a

536
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,299
Blackberry so that's important right

537
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,240
there to know all in itself so I'm gonna

538
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,860
get into the hmds now

539
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,539
so let's make it

540
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,440
let's do it

541
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,440
give me fun

542
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,780
so you guys if you have everything you

543
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,780
need to make this right now

544
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,480
so it takes two cups

545
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,860
of wild blueberries

546
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,860
so let me get some in here

547
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,360
so these are frozen wild blueberries now

548
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,400
you can make the hmds with just the wild

549
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,220
blueberry juice

550
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,679
you don't have to use the berry if you

551
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,140
have the juice that's the option I have

552
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,700
the berries so I want to use those and

553
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm going to put some juice in there as

554
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:48,360
well now two ounces of wild blueberry

555
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,000
juice is what I'm putting in next

556
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,919
so there we go

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,360
if you don't have the fresh stuff you

558
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,799
can just do the wild blueberry juice all

559
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,059
on its own just do two ounces of the

560
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,260
wild blueberry juice

561
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,640
you can do that but I'm going to put

562
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,940
something here

563
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,720
with that there we go

564
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,720
amazing

565
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm gonna put two bananas in here too

566
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,960
incredible about the bananas

567
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,419
is that's a big part of getting glucose

568
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,380
into your system now here's how it works

569
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,820
without enough glucose you can't carry

570
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,840
the nutrients of an hmds into your cells

571
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,960
important to know

572
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,360
you have to have the glucose that's why

573
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,260
each MDS works so much it's designed in

574
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,059
a way to really do the job now

575
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,860
what you're trying to extract is

576
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:43,200
impurities

577
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,080
so I got a couple of bananas in there

578
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,760
which you could do two bananas now I'm

579
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,260
going to put some cilantro in here of

580
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,740
course

581
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,380
now I put a lot of cilantro in you do

582
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,620
one cup tightly packed

583
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,320
I'm gonna drop some cilantro in here

584
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,419
it's breaking it up a little bit

585
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,960
nice

586
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,960
all right

587
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:13,760
now I'm going to put some barley grass

588
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,760
juice powder in here a teaspoon

589
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,520
let's get that in there

590
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,039
that's the vemergy barley grass juice

591
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,280
powder that's critical to know that it's

592
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,980
not barley grass it's barley grass juice

593
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,840
powder that's important to know that's

594
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,120
the one I use that's the one I stand

595
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,100
behind I'm working with these guys I've

596
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,659
endorsed them full throttle because they

597
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,020
are just incredible but this is part of

598
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,419
the aggressive juice powder that is

599
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,059
important in details with the details

600
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,880
Details Matter when it comes down to

601
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,039
this people will use barley grass it

602
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,360
won't do the same thing it just won't

603
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,860
and

604
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,720
people don't realize that they really

605
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,360
got it I got my barley grass but it's

606
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,380
not good enough putting a teaspoon of

607
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,380
the spirulina in here

608
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,659
that's the beverages spirulina right

609
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,880
there

610
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,919
what happens is people will get a low

611
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,740
quality barley grass they'll get a low

612
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,080
quality spirulina they'll they'll put

613
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,059
chlorella in there you can't use it it's

614
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,500
not going to work chlorella is not going

615
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,659
to work I talk about that in the brain

616
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,640
saver books in all the books how it

617
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,320
doesn't work okay that's the beverages

618
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,779
spirulina

619
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,220
see we got that then I'm gonna go with

620
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,159
dose

621
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,260
now you can do the Atlantic dolls the

622
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,020
seaweed I'm going to do two dropper

623
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,779
fulls of the Dulce liquid

624
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,120
that's the vimorgeous liquid right there

625
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,380
a quality can't be beat that's that

626
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,100
incredible

627
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,740
and then you can do some water or some a

628
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,020
cup of water you can do coconut water in

629
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,419
here too that's something as well and

630
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,700
then I'm going to add some orange

631
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,100
now you don't have to put if you've got

632
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,340
a juicy enough orange you may not have

633
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,200
to use any water in there

634
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,059
I just put a little bit of water in

635
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,520
there but I'm also going to squeeze the

636
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,520
juice of one orange in here there you go

637
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,480

649
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,860
Details Matter when it comes down to it

675
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,760
jar right here

676
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,620
do you guys want any

677
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,880
here we go

678
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,760
that is

679
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,380
you know when I hold this

680
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,279
I think about what it's going to do for

681
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,320
me

682
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,000
I connect with it

683
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,260
and I remember there's a wild food in

684
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,080
here

685
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,940
is it important to understand wild foods

686
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,340
have an ability to connect to the person

687
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,320
that's going to be involved to that

688
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,840
person that's holding them to the person

689
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,260
who's actually touching the wild food

690
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,700
wild Foods Harbor information

691
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,620
for human beings to receive

692
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,340
but it's another thing too to have that

693
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:41,460
intention that connection to want to

694
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,799
receive what good it has and I like

695
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,380
letting my body know so I like my

696
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,020
subconscious Consciousness my brain my

697
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,360
soul to tell my body

698
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,500
that this is actually going to be

699
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,140
entering

700
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,179
that color blue the anthocyanins

701
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,159
everything that's in there

702
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,320
I want my body to know impurities are

703
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,559
going to be leaving and so I actually

704
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,600
prep my body and I I actually connect

705
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,279
with it before I just don't gobble it

706
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,260
down sometimes I do if things are crazy

707
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,120
and all that but if I got a second I

708
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,580

747
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,000
you don't know about the brain saver

748
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,740
books

749
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,380
this section right here is called making

750
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,200
peace with our healing timeline

751
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,120
it's really interesting

752
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,640
when we get sick

753
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,260
we start to track the timeline did you

754
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,659
ever do that

755
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,700
do you guys ever go through that

756
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,940
you get sick

757
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,940
and then you track the timeline

758
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:05,220
I got sick in

759
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:06,980
1997. I got sick in 2019 I got sick in

760
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,559
May of

761
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:14,640
2020 I got sick in June

762
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:18,240
of 2021 I got sick in the first week of

763
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,580
August in 2018 right

764
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,799
and so when we get sick we start to

765
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,559
track the timeline and if we don't

766
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,399
remember the year or the month

767
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:33,779
we remember something about it we tend

768
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:35,600
to track that timeline right

769
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,940
we count the days

770
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,880
we've been sick have you ever counted

771
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,100
the days you've been sick

772
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,580
because I know so many people have

773
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,700
literally counted the weeks the days I

774
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,039
know some people they counted the hours

775
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,860
and maybe even the hours we count the

776
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,320
weeks the months and eventually if it

777
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,620
lasts that long if you've been sick that

778
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,940
long we count the years have you guys

779
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,059
ever been there

780
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,059
sick that long Lori Maloney says I got

781
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:12,419
sick in April of 2013.

782
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,700
Lorraine L says I remember my age 34. he

783
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:17,360
got sick at 34 years of age yes I got

784
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,159
sick in 1997.

785
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,740
1997 I just saw that there Maria says

786
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,740
yes definitely know the timeline

787
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,360
and Claire Dunn says yes by months and

788
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,000
years I do

789
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,220
I've never heard anybody talk about this

790
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,440
in Alternative Health or conventional

791
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,600
health I remember when Spirit of

792
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,659
compassion was giving me the information

793
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,480
to put in the book it blew my mind

794
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,299
because what I was getting is that

795
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,820
information and it was making me really

796
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,919
think about it and think about like yeah

797
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,500
you're right like

798
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,080
that really does happen that's really

799
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,960
happening for people

800
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:03,299
Kelly Burke says over 10 years now

801
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,640
exactly yes and uh Rita says 1992.

802
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:08,520
I completely understand

803
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,380
so you know this is really important how

804
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,740
this works I saw someone said I don't

805
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,440
get sick well that's amazing and if you

806
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,600
ever do get sick because everybody gets

807
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,240
sick no matter what at one time in our

808
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,460
life even if it's in the later years you

809
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,640
know where to go

810
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,640
foreign

811
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:35,220
Coster says 1999

812
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,220
yep uh Elena peaser says September 2016.

813
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,260
this is a big deal so remember when

814
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,899
Spirit of compassion was was giving the

815
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,140
information and having me write down the

816
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:46,980
words and I was writing them down and I

817
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,440
wrote

818
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,720
when we get sick we start to track the

819
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,940
timeline I said the spirit of compassion

820
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,980
I said this is blowing my mind we count

821
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,159
the days we've been sick

822
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,200
maybe even the hours

823
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,659
we count the weeks the months and

824
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,240
eventually if it lasts that long we

825
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,700
count the years

826
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,220
something happens to us emotionally when

827
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,899
we when we remember the month we got

828
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,000
sick

829
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,700
I just when I was writing that down I

830
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,320
was just all blown away Pamela K says I

831
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:24,000
remember being sick since I was a little

832
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,099
child only noticed once it got worse

833
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,679
I really believe that I see so many of

834
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:31,200
you guys know the year you got sick

835
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,859
you know the month too so many of you

836
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,300
like I see 2014 I see 2016. I'm just

837
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,820
watching the comments you guys you guys

838
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,000
are just like you guys remember you guys

839
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,540
know I've never heard this spoken a word

840
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,940
in all my years 35 years working in the

841
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,399
industry 35 years just doing what it did

842
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,740
even before that when I was a kid

843
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,599
I never seen this and so when Spirit of

844
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,619
compassion made me write this down I was

845
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,640
like

846
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:05,280
this is just blowing my mind 2011 I see

847
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,280
that too 2016 1989 whoa

848
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,400
something happens to us emotionally when

849
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,619
we when we remember the month we got

850
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,680
sick the time of year

851
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:20,040
many of us remember the people we were

852
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,960
around when we first got sick do you any

853
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,480
of you remember the people you were

854
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,520
around when you first got sick because

855
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,260
that was another thing so in spirit of

856
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,720
compassion said that

857
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,640
I was just like no

858
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,740
you know so many of us remember the

859
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,820
people we were around when we first got

860
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,800
sick

861
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,560
and yes you do you remember the people

862
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,720
you were around when you first got sick

863
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,760
yeah so right after the night after you

864
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,280
gave birth I saw that

865
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,859
well and then the and here's another

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,300
thing too the job we were doing do you

867
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:53,940
guys remember the job you were doing

868
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,700
when we when you guys got sick the

869
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,579
commitments we had on our plate

870
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,720
time plays a large role in our emotional

871
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,760
brain

872
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,460
it's as if our emotional brain is

873
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,640
directly connected to time

874
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,220
which is really incredible sure we worry

875
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,640
about time on a daily basis

876
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,280
even when we're not sick or struggling

877
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,579
our responsibilities and plans are based

878
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,720
around time yet something changes when

879
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,060
we're sick

880
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,500
we see time differently

881
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:30,359
we start saying it's time to get better

882
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,040
I get emotional talking about this

883
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,420
because I know so many people have

884
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,800
struggled and I know you guys have

885
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,220
throughout the years

886
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,339
it's almost like time changes

887
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,500
and we end up just saying to ourselves

888
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,680
it's time to get better I have to get

889
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,740
better it's like time alters when you

890
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,859
become sick it's not about the time that

891
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,079
someone else is on it's about now it's

892
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,980
time to get better and that's what it's

893
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,800
about

894
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:02,220
or it's about time I'm feeling better

895
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,720
were we here it's in due time you'll get

896
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,900
better right you'll hear that one too

897
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,599
and do do time you'll get better

898
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,240
time is such a large aspect of illness

899
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,920
because if we're sick

900
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,680
we feel

901
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,020
like we're losing out

902
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,940
and yeah that part's a tough one for me

903
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,859
because I I've watched so many people

904
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,500
throughout the years

905
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,839
go through so much sickness

906
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,119
and one of their big things is that I'm

907
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,560
losing out if you guys just rolled in

908
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,240
we're reading right out of brain saver

909
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,339
saw somebody say what are we what are we

910
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,099
doing reading right out of brain saver

911
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:39,420
right here we're making the hmds I have

912
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:41,099
one right here which I'm excited about

913
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,200
if you guys don't mind I would like to

914
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,119
take a sip

915
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,099
that's so good

916
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,619
that is so good why does something taste

917
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,359
so good when you know it's so good and

918
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:53,359
what it does for you too but it's both

919
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,760
um

920
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,560
time is such a large aspect of illness

921
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,180
because if we're sick we feel like we're

922
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,700
losing out

923
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,619
time is passing Us by

924
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,079
at the start it doesn't feel as

925
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,839
threatening emotionally yeah I've been

926
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,300
sick for a week two weeks

927
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:17,640
the hands of time start to feel heavy

928
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,740
when it goes on too long that's why you

929
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,920
guys are warriors

930
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,980
all you guys are warriors seriously

931
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,720
you found medical medium information

932
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,579
through obviously some spiritual divine

933
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,339
intervention

934
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,800
okay you bent a doctor after doctor you

935
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:36,119
better practitioner after practitioner

936
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,640
and then

937
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,680
somehow the book landed on your front

938
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,359
door somehow it landed in your lap

939
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,240
somewhere somehow you saw something

940
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,920
somehow you were told check this out but

941
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,359
some kind of divine intervention

942
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,520
happened

943
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,320
spiritual intervention

944
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,359
where you found the medical medium

945
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,579
information

946
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,619
and you were like okay I have to do

947
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,619
something I've been sick too long I need

948
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:05,540
to change course and you found the info

949
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,540
and you're turning your lives around

950
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,000
the hands of time start to feel heavy

951
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,500
when it goes on too long you're not

952
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,020
quite better

953
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,300
you're even getting worse so many people

954
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,820
have been through that and now time

955
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,280
becomes doctor appointments and your

956
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,859
care schedule time is about how much

957
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,960
energy you have how much space you have

958
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,579
around your illness to do what you need

959
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,800
to do

960
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:33,780
and that's where time changes

961
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,300
it's like now I'm sick and it's all

962
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,400
about how do I how do I work my schedule

963
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,060
around this sickness

964
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,820
life can change when we're sick

965
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,859
causing restrictions making us feel

966
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,240
everything is so difficult we have to

967
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,220
slow down

968
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,740
that's why you guys are like Warriors

969
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,140
for real you have been through it all

970
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,300
you know what it's like

971
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,800
and then you found the medical beam

972
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,800
information and you're working hard on

973
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,020
your healing process and your healing

974
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,940
our emotional brain

975
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,839
puts due dates

976
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,119
and past due dates on our recovery

977
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,480
I gotta be ready by this time I got to

978
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,619
be better in a week I have to be better

979
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,079
here then

980
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,579
we end up putting like due dates on

981
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,800
things that's how the brain works it's

982
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:26,460
really kind of incredible

983
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,380
the emotional center of the brain

984
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,380
starts to create due dates

985
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,160
it's kind of like not you creating them

986
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,140
it's actually

987
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,240
integrated in the emotional center of

988
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,240
the brain to create these due dates

989
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,720
I have to heal or this date

990
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,000
and then I was supposed to be better

991
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,040
already I was supposed to be better

992
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,280
already it's another thing that people

993
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,920
say we can feel trapped in a Time War

994
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,500
our emotional brain wants us to be

995
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,359
healed by a certain time and our

996
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,640
physical body is not ready to heal

997
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,200
because it's not getting exactly what it

998
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,099
needs to heal and that's what's so

999
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,099
incredible right now

1000
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,619
when you look at Medical meme

1001
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,480
information and you look at the books

1002
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,339
and you look at all that we're doing

1003
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,780
and you look at the incredible healing

1004
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,480
foods

1005
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,560
it's about getting your body what it

1006
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,320
needs

1007
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,119
for the first time

1008
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,800
a lot of people they're sick for many

1009
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,200
years and they have these due dates

1010
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,839
built into it and they want to be ready

1011
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,880
by a certain amount of time but their

1012
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,339
their emotional brain says I want to be

1013
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,200
fixed now their emotional brain says I

1014
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,859
want to be better in a week

1015
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:47,400
but their physical body is saying you're

1016
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:49,859
not giving me what it needs

1017
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,920
that's what our physical body does

1018
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:55,320
our physical body says

1019
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,720
hold on a minute

1020
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,480
I know you want to get better

1021
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,300
I know you want to heal I know you want

1022
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,740
it to be healed last week

1023
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,859
but you're not giving me what it needs

1024
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,760
I know that emotionally and mentally

1025
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:14,160
you're there

1026
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,700
you want to be healed

1027
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,680
you want to be fixed snap of a finger

1028
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,619
you want to think about some mastering

1029
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,480
of the brain and logic and heal

1030
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,980
you're even going to go uneven try all

1031
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,839
kinds of different stuff to try to fix

1032
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,000
it

1033
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,520
but your physical body is going to say

1034
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,480
hold your horses

1035
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,900
until you give me what I need

1036
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,900
your physical body needs

1037
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,200
they're not going to get better

1038
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,900
and that's what our physical body does

1039
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,520
even though our emotional

1040
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,099
brain

1041
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,740
says no I'm giving myself two weeks to

1042
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,780
heal I'm gonna be out of this

1043
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,099
and then the two weeks go by and you're

1044
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
still sick

1045
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:02,640
I'm gonna go see this person I'm gonna

1046
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,500
go see that person I'm gonna find a way

1047
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,420
to fix it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna get

1048
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,420
better and then you're still sick

1049
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,339
because no matter what your physical

1050
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,660
body didn't get what it needed but I

1051
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,460
thought my physical body was getting

1052
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,140
what it needed I went to this doctor I

1053
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,420
went to dysfunctional guy I went to this

1054
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,099
heeler I went to this natural guy I went

1055
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,660
to this gal I went to all these

1056
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,339
different experts in the field of

1057
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,099
medicine in the field of alternative

1058
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:28,140
medicine I went to everybody I thought I

1059
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:30,720
was giving my body what it needs but

1060
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,760
your body still says you're not healing

1061
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,700
and you're not going to heal until you

1062
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,880
give me what it needs

1063
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,560
just because

1064
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
somebody out there says oh this is what

1065
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,040
you need or that's what you need doesn't

1066
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,960
mean it's exact it's exactly what your

1067
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,400
body needs

1068
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,200
and that's what's incredible about the

1069
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,079
medical medium information

1070
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,300
it bypassed all of that confusion to

1071
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,220
give people what their body needed and

1072
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,380
that's why it has the most people

1073
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,460
healing in the world than anything else

1074
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,819
in

1075
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,339
the world of Health right

1076
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:08,099
then once you do get what your body

1077
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:10,020
needs it can take time to heal depending

1078
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:13,020
on what you're up against but you see

1079
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,839
the results as time goes on because your

1080
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,500
body's finally getting what it needs and

1081
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,500
it's incredible

1082
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:26,160
what's wrong with our physical body has

1083
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:28,380
not been identified yet even with the

1084
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,079
best of Specialists and best diagnoses

1085
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,420
out there so how would anybody know

1086
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,119
their body's getting what it needs then

1087
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,339
when we put ourselves on a timetable to

1088
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,079
heal we get let down when we haven't

1089
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,740
healed yet I'm gonna heal in a month

1090
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,420
month goes by not healed man I'm let

1091
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,480
down now

1092
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,599
then we register it as a failure I'm a

1093
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,359
failure I didn't heal within those two

1094
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,800
weeks I must be a failure that's what we

1095
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,380
do

1096
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,079
I failed to heal before the second

00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,560
how is it possible that I didn't heal

1108
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,920
yet it feels like we're not getting

1109
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,560
better in time to live our lives and

1110
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,980
then when we're sick for too long time

1111
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,960
seems to blur itself into one do you

1112
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,940
ever see that guy do you ever see that

1113
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,819
person out there and it's like

1114
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,040
you've been sick so long that just time

1115
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:55,440
just all blurs together in the end and

1116
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,200
that happens too at a certain point

1117
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,800
we're not keeping track anymore

1118
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,960
only noting the landmarks along the way

1119
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,700
trying to get better has become too long

1120
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,400
drawn out and time-consuming real

1121
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,300
process Clarendon says yes love to hear

1122
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,300
this validation

1123
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,819
I mean I was in tears believe it or not

1124
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,579
when I was writing this getting the

1125
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:22,800
information from SOC because I connected

1126
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:24,420
to so many of you and so many people out

1127
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,920
there that have just suffered for so

1128
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,040
long it's just when you really think

1129
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,480
about what they're going through

1130
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,480
it's really hard

1131
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,760
having faith and trust in your body

1132
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,760
and your body's ability to heal is a big

1133
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,060
part of not letting the time stamp of

1134
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,599
every moment spent being sick lets you

1135
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,579
down getting in touch this is such an

1136
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,980
important piece of information right

1137
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,500
here and this is why I don't do programs

1138
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,960
and charge thousands of dollars because

1139
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,520
this can we can package this up and do a

1140
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,079
program people sign up and they learn

1141
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,160
about their healing process Vital

1142
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,839
Information they're not going to hear

1143
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,859
anywhere but this is why we don't do

1144
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,140
that

1145
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:06,300
because this should be free

1146
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,619
this information should be free you

1147
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,640
should be able to get this information

1148
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:14,460
and and actually fortify your emotional

1149
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,579
brain work on your healing deeper

1150
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,960
get answers this should not be held back

1151
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:20,960
and then a paywall

1152
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,560
having faith and trust in your body's

1153
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,319
healing is a big part of not letting the

1154
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,579
time stamp of every moment spent being

1155
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,579
sick let you down

1156
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,260
that's a big deal right there we have an

1157
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,640
emotional attachment to time when we

1158
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,980
become sick

1159
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,800
we do we get this emotional attachment

1160
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,500
to time Christy says what you are saying

1161
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,079
is so much my experience

1162
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,880
I believe it

1163
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,800
some of it healthy some of it

1164
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,960
unproductive part of this is the

1165
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,400
conditioning we've all experienced so

1166
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,819
what I'm trying to say you guys is we're

1167
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,980
conditioned to be sick

1168
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:07,319
the law of the land out there has been

1169
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,359
set up for us to get sick

1170
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:11,700
then when we get sick we're conditioned

1171
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,480
to think a certain way when we're sick

1172
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,220
which is all sick

1173
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,319
part of this conditioning we've all

1174
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,200
experienced institutions have

1175
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:25,140
conditioned us to live on timetables

1176
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,180
that are industrialized we're made to

1177
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,339
feel like we're wasting time no matter

1178
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,500
what we're doing we're made to feel like

1179
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:34,440
we have to be on time for everything

1180
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,020
when we get sick this conditioning is

1181
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,319
still at work so we're conditioned about

1182
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,540
time and then when we get sick the

1183
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,300
conditioning is still there and that

1184
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:47,520
makes it worse and we suffer emotionally

1185
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,359
because of this institutionalized

1186
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,359
timeline

1187
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,720
God should get the brain saver books if

1188
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,300
you don't have it and learn and learn

1189
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,280
this stuff it's so incredible

1190
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,619
when we get sick this conditioning is

1191
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,240
still at work and the gears need to be

1192
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:08,760
shifted we need to shift these gears

1193
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,700
that's what this stuff does

1194
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,500
this might be like a fun medical

1195
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,240
meanwhile blueberry challenge but it's

1196
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,460
always deeper than that and it's always

1197
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,619
more than that

1198
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,079
the emotional centers of the brain need

1199
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:25,020
to get new messages remember when I told

1200
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,660
you ancient food

1201
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,960
ancient food that has inflammation and

1202
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,339
messaging in it for thousands and

1203
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,339
thousands of years

1204
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:40,920
we can't be trapped by the everyday

1205
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,440
industrialized timetable we've been

1206
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,440
taught to live by we can't apply that

1207
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,920
timetable to our healing we have to

1208
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,300
learn to separate the two the

1209
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,220
industrialized timetable

1210
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,220
and our natural healing timeline

1211
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,720
really incredible information right

1212
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,880
there all on its own let's make an

1213
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,760
extractor

1214
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,260
wait half time you guys do you remember

1215
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,700
the robot

1216
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,359
chickadees do you guys want to do the

1217
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,359
robot with me

1218
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,940
chickadee and friends want to do it with

1219
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,940
me

1220
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,760
[Music]

1221
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,079
all right half time

1222
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,760
the robot

1223
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,720
all right you guys that was the quickest

1224
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,520
halftime I've ever seen ever

1225
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,240
all right guys um

1226
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:44,359
no laugh attacks I will have some of

1227
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,359
this

1228
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,819
ah the hmds is insane

1229
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:55,440
it's so good so let's make an extractor

1230
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:58,619
smoothie if you guys don't mind so

1231
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,359
now here's the thing the tractor

1232
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:02,700
smoothie

1233
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:06,480
it aids in the removing different

1234
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:10,680
varieties of toxicity

1235
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,440
also freeing the path for toxic stuff

1236
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,559
to uproot and leave the body

1237
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,180
get the impurities out so let's make an

1238
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,619
extractor smoothie which I'm excited

1239
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,619
about so let's start

1240
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,859
let's start right now

1241
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,920
so you got your blenders ready are you

1242
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,540
guys with me we're going to make this

1243
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,920
together now if you don't have what you

1244
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:40,500
need right now

1245
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:43,619
fine that's okay I mean that's all right

1246
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,740
so it starts out with one apple chopped

1247
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,240
now if you have a really large Apple you

1248
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,220
don't have to use the whole thing if you

1249
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,780
want like a gigantic one this is a

1250
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,780
medium-sized apple right here

1251
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,559
chopping that Apple up

1252
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:05,700
and it's going into the blender

1253
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:08,300
we're making the extractor smoothie

1254
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,300
foreign

1255
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:17,599
saver books just so you know that's

1256
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,599
where it is we're doing one apple

1257
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,420
okay

1258
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:27,680
now let's go find the extractor smoothie

1259
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,680
if you guys don't mind

1260
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,079
and remember you guys I'm at your

1261
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:36,240
service always at your service I am here

1262
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,160
I am working for you

1263
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,220
okay

1264
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,220
um

1265
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,619
we're gonna go into the ingredients now

1266
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,240
let's go find the extractor smoothie

1267
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:48,180
it's over here I have it marked to get

1268
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:51,260
to it real quick and easy here it is

1269
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,260
you're looking at it

1270
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,920
now

1271
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:58,140
that's what it looks like

1272
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,579
it's inside brain saver

1273
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,579
all right so let's move this over

1274
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,240
Colleen says when should I use this

1275
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,859
extractor afternoon is great it's fine

1276
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,200
if you're short of time and you have to

1277
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:15,420
use it sometime in the late morning you

1278
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,160
can possibly do that but I like doing it

1279
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,079
at the other end of the day that's my

1280
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,619
favorite time to do it it's a great time

1281
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,200
to do it so you do the hmds

1282
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:28,140
in the morning mid morning or whenever

1283
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,880
you wake up later on right whatever

1284
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:33,240
depending on your day you could wake up

1285
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,040
at noon and then you can do your hmds

1286
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,200
later on and then you do your extractor

1287
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,480
by night whatever you know whatever you

00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:45,200
can I throw it around a little bit

1333
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,200
do you you know I put a backspin on it

1334
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,420
I haven't had a chance to throw fruit

1335
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:56,940
around in a while or vegetables or roots

1336
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,960
putting in one of these in there

1337
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,960
these radishes

1338
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,740
I'm gonna stop fooling around can't be

1339
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,660
all

1340
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,819
fun and games

1341
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,099
EO fruits and veggies says medical

1342
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:13,200
medium has stopped progression of so

1343
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:17,339
many symptoms but taught me I've been

1344
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,859
sick my whole life I worry some damage

1345
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:22,319
is irreversible

1346
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:24,420
and yet to get relief from brain shots

1347
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,400
and meditations any tips

1348
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,619
I mean here's how it works everybody has

1349
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,480
a different amount of poison toxin or

1350
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:32,280
packaging like I was talking about many

1351
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,079
times throughout the years especially in

1352
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,000
the medical medium books right

1353
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,500
and you got to think about a couple of

1354
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,780
things

1355
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,300
how worse would it be if you weren't

1356
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:45,300
doing the right things

1357
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,599
how worse would it be

1358
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:51,119
think about that so many people would

1359
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,339
decline decline decline if they don't

1360
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,079
have the right stuff and Decline and

1361
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:56,940
that's an entirely different thing you

1362
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,880
want to stop that

1363
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,140
so you want to stop the declining and

1364
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,460
stabilize

1365
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:07,440
right and then move forward okay some

1366
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,839
people they heal literally boom like

1367
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,700
really quick they got less pathogens

1368
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,099
less problems with their neurological

1369
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,800
system because of less impurities less

1370
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:19,859
toxins less Metals less all this stuff

1371
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:23,099
right and then there's other situations

1372
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:25,020
like what what you may have used and are

1373
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:27,839
you customizing so got to keep in mind

1374
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,640
and I tell anybody who actually

1375
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,900
and you could bring the books to your

1376
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,119
doctor too

1377
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,980
there's so much detailed comprehensive

1378
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,339
information in the medical medium books

1379
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:40,319
that you can customize your path

1380
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:43,079
to take it all the way

1381
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,900
keep that in mind you can customize your

1382
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:49,319
path to take it all the way

1383
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:51,960
but are you customizing it are you doing

1384
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:53,520
the different Protocols are you doing

1385
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,319
the different cleanses are you doing

1386
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,640
like there's there's a lot of people

1387
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:58,500
that I talk to

1388
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,000
I ask them about it and they're like

1389
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,440
well yeah I was eating chocolate last

1390
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,380
month I go

1391
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,140
I was like dude you you have no room for

1392
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,140
eating chocolate a month ago if you need

1393
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:12,720
to go the full distance you can't eat a

1394
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,940
chocolate you know cacao nibs and cacao

1395
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,619
bars and all that you can't do that and

1396
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,480
I talked to another person they're like

1397
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,240
yeah no I do caffeine once in a while

1398
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,760
I'm like then stop coming to me saying

1399
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,380
you're not healing all the way you've

1400
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,119
only healed half the way or three

1401
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,099
quarters because you're lucky you'll

1402
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,720
heal half the way because at least you

1403
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:33,000
didn't go backwards all the way to the

1404
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,920
dumps but you can go all the way forward

1405
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,260
you just have to know how to customize

1406
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,000
it you see that the client you see the

1407
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,619
declining out there in the world you see

1408
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,940
the declining with people's lives and

1409
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,900
health out there in the world when

1410
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,700
they're not bringing the right

1411
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,260
information and it happens every day it

1412
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,619
happens fast out there I watch people

1413
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:52,020
drop all the time out there but every

1414
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:55,500
time I talk to somebody that's like out

1415
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:58,200
there that's like look I've gotten

1416
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:01,020
50 symptoms better I still have four

1417
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,760
more symptoms to go where I got 20

1418
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,920
symptoms better which I couldn't get

1419
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,619
better anywhere else I hand it to the

1420
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,720
medical medium info but how come I can't

1421
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:12,299
get these other symptoms better and then

1422
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:15,140
when you ask them and you talk to them

1423
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:18,180
they were eating like charcoal pills

1424
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:21,540
from some recommendation they were doing

1425
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,940
apple cider vinegar gummies like two

1426
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,740
months ago they were doing chlorella

1427
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,540
they were doing like stuff that just

1428
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,799
stops them from healing there then next

1429
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,299
thing you know it they were doing

1430
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,400
something else then they were eating

1431
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:34,380
chocolate then they were back on gluten

1432
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,319
like you just can't you can't control

1433
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,720
the Free Will of everybody you can't

1434
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:41,099
and I realized that over the years but I

1435
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,540
was talking to somebody recently and I

1436
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:45,480
sat there and almost pulled all my hair

1437
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,220
out of my head because they were eating

1438
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,140
gluten like a couple of months ago

1439
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,819
gluten will set you back if you got that

1440
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:52,920
many pathogens then they were eating

1441
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:54,240
chocolate and they were redoing this and

1442
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,980
then they were getting guidance to do

1443
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,220
apple cider vinegar gummies and when

1444
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:01,140
that happens is it's like

1445
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,160
it's just you gotta customize your

1446
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,960
pathway

1447
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,520
and you got to watch out for the traps

1448
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,980
in potholes

1449
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,020
and you have to stay diligent and you

1450
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:13,040
got to know the information and you

1451
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,040
can't get derailed

1452
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,200
so you're making the extractor smoothie

1453
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,020
right here

1454
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,980
which I'm excited about

1455
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,980
so

1456
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,640
we got the parsley in here which is

1457
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,260
incredible we got the radish in here we

1458
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,359
got the banana we got the wild blueberry

1459
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:33,839
juice in there too now we're gonna put a

1460
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:38,299
little bit of mustard seed as well so

1461
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:38,299
one teaspoon of mustard seed coming up

1462
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,859
Mustard Seed coming up one teaspoon

1463
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,700
one teaspoon coming up here

1464
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,599
now a lot of you guys might be like oh

1465
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:56,880
whoa Mustard Seed is pretty intense

1466
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,980
but you don't look this is the extractor

1467
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,720
and that's the whole point like the

1468
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,819
medical meme information is so Advanced

1469
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,160

medical meme information is there for

get better any other way

1505
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,140
people have struggled around the world

1506
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,720
tried everything been there done that

1507
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,940
seasoned people that came to Medical

1508
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,180
mean information

1509
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:06,359
it was always about

1510
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:08,760
having the answers and the ability to to

1511
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:10,319
have those answers use them and know

1512
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,579
what to do to heal

1513
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,579
that's what it was about

1514
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,140
mm info was in something somebody goes

1515
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,240
to first after they have to be around

1516
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,280
the bend they have to know what it's

1517
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,540
like out there because when you get a

1518
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,220
newbie who doesn't know what it's like

1519
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:29,280
out there but they've told to go to mm

1520
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,540
first they sometimes take it for granted

1521
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,619
because they don't realize how bad it

1522
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,960
really is

1523
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:37,260
the information here has saved so many

1524
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:40,440
lives around the world it's unbelievable

1525
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,900
when you think about it and it all makes

1526
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,940
sense none of medical leave information

1527
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,160
is common sense

1528
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,140
it's above common sense because Common

1529
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,280
Sense would never know any of the things

1530
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:55,260

1531
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,359

1537
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,700
