[0.52 - 6.12] PID all kinds of different conditions
[3.44 - 8.44] urinary tract infections are on the rise
[6.12 - 13.00] up up up up they're not going down down
[8.44 - 14.80] down UTI are going up up and away the
[13.00 - 19.48] problem is with UTI they're not just
[14.80 - 21.48] going up they're going chronically crazy
[19.48 - 23.72] where women are
[21.48 - 26.24] suffering
[23.72 - 29.28] incredible suffering we're talking about
[26.24 - 31.48] devastating suffering because of UTI
[29.28 - 34.12] chronic I that don't want to go anywhere
[31.48 - 37.76] because guess what the bacteria became
[34.12 - 39.00] super bacteria it is now a super bug
[37.76 - 41.36] that's what's happening so so many
[39.00 - 44.64] people are dealing dealing with chronic
[41.36 - 47.20] UTI they can't get past them they can't
[44.64 - 49.76] move forward it's just tormenting them
[47.20 - 53.28] and it doesn't go away same thing with
[49.76 - 56.84] pelvic inflammatory disease that too
[53.28 - 58.92] just keeps on tormenting women in such
[56.84 - 61.40] ways that is
[58.92 - 63.92] undescribable because words don't match
[61.40 - 65.96] the suffering they are suffering with so
[63.92 - 68.72] we're going into that UTI bladder
[65.96 - 72.48] infections kidney infections right
[68.72 - 76.48] urinary tract infections yeast
[72.48 - 80.28] infections yeast infections
[76.48 - 81.76] interesting yeast yeast yeast so funny
[80.28 - 83.52] thing about well it's nothing funny
[81.76 - 86.92] about it but the funny thing about yeast
[83.52 - 90.84] infections is it's not the yeast is not
[86.92 - 93.32] the real problem it is bacteria area
[90.84 - 94.96] that's Underneath It All the yeast just
[93.32 - 98.28] the immune system is so challenged in
[94.96 - 100.84] that area that the that yeast just grows
[98.28 - 103.72] because it's growing because there's so
[100.84 - 105.92] much of an immune suppressive um
[103.72 - 108.00] situation happening in the bladder area
[105.92 - 110.56] the vaginal area all of that that the
[108.00 - 113.56] yeast just tends to explode but it's
[110.56 - 116.08] exploding because the bacteria is
[113.56 - 118.56] thriving and taking over we're talking
[116.08 - 120.24] about strep we're talking about bacteria
[118.56 - 122.04] we're talking about super bugs a little
[120.24 - 124.04] bit we're going into that we're talking
[122.04 - 126.68] about UTI we're going to talk about
[124.04 - 128.00] solutions for UTI as well so that's
[126.68 - 129.68] going to be really helpful for a lot of
[128.00 - 131.28] people that are dealing with UTI you
[129.68 - 132.84] don't want to miss this episode this is
[131.28 - 135.28] an important one I'm even reading a
[132.84 - 138.12] little bit out of Liver Rescue a little
[135.28 - 140.84] bit out of cleanse to heal don't miss
[138.12 - 143.16] this do you know anybody struggling or
[140.84 - 145.64] suffering with UTI or have a history of
[143.16 - 148.36] UTI and now they have acne now they got
[145.64 - 151.00] sibo years later they get sibo now they
[148.36 - 153.24] get PID now they got acne again then
[151.00 - 155.88] they got an ear infection then they got
[153.24 - 159.08] a sore throat and a strep throat problem
[155.88 - 162.48] M yeah exactly strep strap strap strap
[159.08 - 164.68] strap strap strap exactly sibo they
[162.48 - 167.24] never talk about what bacteria it is
[164.68 - 170.96] that creates small intestinal bacterial
[167.24 - 174.52] overgrowth but it's strep our good old
[170.96 - 176.88] friend strep hey strep how are you fine
[174.52 - 179.76] doing okay living in everybody's
[176.88 - 182.92] lymphatic vessels living in everybody's
[179.76 - 186.36] pores living in everybody's throats
[182.92 - 189.80] living in everybody's butts yep you got
[186.36 - 192.60] it that's what happens strep is always
[189.80 - 195.20] hanging around people's anuses it's
[192.60 - 197.28] hanging around the rectums all the time
[195.20 - 199.68] that's where strep loves to be it's
[197.28 - 202.60] around everybody's throat it's in their
[199.68 - 204.20] mouth every day people have more than
[202.60 - 206.00] one variety two variety they'll have
[204.20 - 207.80] three variety four variety five variety
[206.00 - 211.32] six variety seven variety they'll have
[207.80 - 215.28] 10 varieties of strep some dormant some
[211.32 - 220.04] lowkey some much more serious creating
[215.28 - 222.88] everything from acne to sty yep sty
[220.04 - 225.04] thrush all that thrush on their tongue
[222.88 - 227.36] just causing problems so that's the
[225.04 - 229.00] whole thing there we're going into strep
[227.36 - 233.12] and we're going into UTI but let's hit
[229.00 - 235.12] the UTI problem because that is critical
[233.12 - 238.48] because I'm seeing it more and more
[235.12 - 241.20] years ago I didn't see it like it was
[238.48 - 244.52] today you'd have that antibiotic
[241.20 - 248.88] resistant UTI you'd have that out there
[244.52 - 252.88] I saw it out there okay but now it's
[248.88 - 256.00] unlike it's ever been it's never been to
[252.88 - 257.84] this degree I called it though and I saw
[256.00 - 260.12] I've written about it that these bugs
[257.84 - 262.80] would actually take off to such a degree
[260.12 - 267.36] where they'd be antibiotic resistant but
[262.80 - 270.28] not just Mera not talking about Mera I'm
[267.36 - 273.40] talking about plain old Jan
[270.28 - 274.84] strep not Mera this is important to know
[273.40 - 276.64] this is a really good episode and we're
[274.84 - 279.84] going to talk about Solutions too which
[276.64 - 283.16] are critical um let's get into it a
[279.84 - 285.72] little bit the antibiotic dilemma do you
[283.16 - 289.76] guys uh love antibiotics antibiotics are
[285.72 - 292.96] the leading treatment for
[289.76 - 296.60] UTI antibiotics are the leading
[292.96 - 301.08] treatments for UTI you know what that
[296.60 - 304.24] means that means decade after decade of
[301.08 - 307.20] bugs that are actually becoming
[304.24 - 309.96] immune to the
[307.20 - 313.24] antibiotic it's how it works and then
[309.96 - 316.16] that bug spreads to another person and
[313.24 - 319.32] so that person receives that bug and
[316.16 - 323.24] then now they have an antibiotic
[319.32 - 325.52] resistant bug they get sick and then
[323.24 - 329.72] they go to the doctor the doctor gives
[325.52 - 333.24] them an antibiotic again and now their
[329.72 - 336.48] bug is in them that's already antibiotic
[333.24 - 337.84] resistant is now even becoming more
[336.48 - 340.04] antibiotic
[337.84 - 342.88] resistant and
[340.04 - 345.52] the and then it keeps on going on and on
[342.88 - 348.32] and on and on so that's what's
[345.52 - 351.36] happening it's not like the old
[348.32 - 355.20] days and then the antibiotic kills the
[351.36 - 358.24] weakest bacteria but the strong survives
[355.20 - 362.72] so let's do this
[358.24 - 366.88] okay I prepared for this one here we go
[362.72 - 369.40] okay you got a bacterium right here you
[366.88 - 371.44] got a bacterium right here got a
[369.40 - 373.00] bacterium right here and a bacterium
[371.44 - 374.72] right here and I'll even put another one
[373.00 - 375.68] right here and one more right here so
[374.72 - 379.32] these are
[375.68 - 383.60] bacteria okay so here we are take a look
[379.32 - 386.12] you guys these are inside the bladder or
[383.60 - 391.24] the kidneys so let's make a bladder
[386.12 - 394.00] here okay there we are we got a bladder
[391.24 - 396.76] right and in that bladder is a whole
[394.00 - 400.44] bunch of bacteria and strep bacteria is
[396.76 - 403.48] what it is okay so antibiotics are used
[400.44 - 406.00] all of a sudden boom we take an
[403.48 - 408.92] antibiotic the antibiotic is coming
[406.00 - 413.00] through right now here it goes there it
[408.92 - 413.00] is the antibiotic coming
[414.72 - 420.00] through there we go can't really see
[418.16 - 424.80] this good but there it is Boom the
[420.00 - 426.44] antibiotic came through then now we get
[424.80 - 429.56] some dead
[426.44 - 431.28] bacteria this one explodes Boom the
[429.56 - 435.24] antibiotic killed
[431.28 - 436.40] it boom Another One explodes boom
[435.24 - 439.20] Another One
[436.40 - 443.80] explodes interesting this one just gets
[439.20 - 445.12] maed that bacterium gets maed this one
[443.80 - 448.12] just gets
[445.12 - 451.76] weakened am I yelling this one gets
[448.12 - 453.04] weakened okay okay this one doesn't get
[451.76 - 457.80] harmed at
[453.04 - 461.60] all all right we got a weakened
[457.80 - 465.88] bacterium we got a maed bacterium
[461.60 - 468.68] damaged but they survive they survive
[465.88 - 469.48] and they provide information now against
[468.68 - 474.48] that
[469.48 - 477.16] antibiotic they hold the key to survival
[474.48 - 480.20] against the antibiotic that was given to
[477.16 - 483.64] them think about that right now right
[480.20 - 486.28] and then you got one that survived it
[483.64 - 490.00] completely that also holds information
[486.28 - 492.12] but it's completely unharmed in fact it
[490.00 - 496.04] seemed to do good with the antibiotic
[492.12 - 497.28] that one little bug right there drank
[496.04 - 500.60] those
[497.28 - 504.08] antibiotics consumed them it didn't hurt
[500.60 - 505.92] them and now this one bug right here is
[504.08 - 508.92] getting
[505.92 - 511.88] stronger nice and strong now now it's a
[508.92 - 514.88] nice strong bacterium you see this the
[511.88 - 517.60] maed ones not as strong but they provide
[514.88 - 520.72] information and they stay alive is what
[517.60 - 523.32] they do they too survive it and they're
[520.72 - 526.24] a they survive it in the aftermath
[523.32 - 528.96] they're still hanging around okay and
[526.24 - 531.24] then another one too at the same time
[528.96 - 534.40] still survived it and it's it's there
[531.24 - 538.84] right so now you got three bacterium but
[534.40 - 541.92] three different bacterium same bacteria
[538.84 - 545.72] but three different experiences three
[541.92 - 550.12] different strengths and three different
[545.72 - 552.28] injuries one not injured two one maed
[550.12 - 556.08] one injured there's a problem with that
[552.28 - 558.80] though because then as it's producing
[556.08 - 561.64] more bacteria is being produced okay
[558.80 - 563.92] which happens more and more
[561.64 - 566.12] bacteria is being
[563.92 - 567.04] produced right here's your bacteria
[566.12 - 569.72] right
[567.04 - 572.72] here and these bacteria are getting
[569.72 - 575.64] stronger and producing the weak
[572.72 - 580.16] ones okay want to be as strong as the
[575.64 - 583.04] strong one so the weak ones become even
[580.16 - 584.92] stronger than the original strong one
[583.04 - 588.00] that wasn't even affected by the
[584.92 - 590.28] original back antibiotic okay this is
[588.00 - 593.16] important the weaker
[590.28 - 595.76] ones gain strength the ones that were
[593.16 - 597.96] maimed and injured by the an antibiotic
[595.76 - 600.64] keep that in mind they were maimed and
[597.96 - 605.40] injured at and they
[600.64 - 608.68] now okay they strengthen they rise above
[605.40 - 611.60] it they gather information from their
[608.68 - 614.88] injuries they learn how to not get
[611.60 - 617.24] injured again by the antibiotic they
[614.88 - 620.28] become stronger than the one that
[617.24 - 623.68] survived completely without injury at
[620.28 - 627.52] all and that's a problem all on its own
[623.68 - 629.76] okay so now you have very strong
[627.52 - 633.92] bacteria here's the thing
[629.76 - 636.84] they get stronger they get stronger and
[633.92 - 642.96] then all
[636.84 - 646.32] right and then a new infection
[642.96 - 649.16] occurs they get stronger they override
[646.32 - 651.92] the immune system of the person drops
[649.16 - 654.28] exactly the immune system
[651.92 - 658.04] drops there's another bladder right
[654.28 - 661.32] there okay so white blood
[658.04 - 663.68] cells for some reason aren't as strong
[661.32 - 665.56] in that person their own white blood
[663.68 - 669.92] cells aren't doing the jobs they need to
[665.56 - 672.72] do they get triggered they get exposures
[669.92 - 677.08] something happens there and then the
[672.72 - 679.72] bacteria rise up and get stronger and
[677.08 - 681.84] now we have a new infection they
[679.72 - 684.60] reproduce I'm going to make a whole
[681.84 - 687.72] bunch of them here if you guys with me
[684.60 - 689.76] you're following me right now okay and
[687.72 - 692.96] then the new antibiotic comes through
[689.76 - 695.24] they're sick again and then a new wave
[692.96 - 698.52] of antibiotic comes through they're at
[695.24 - 701.72] the doctor's office they got a new
[698.52 - 703.68] UTI and then boom here comes the
[701.72 - 706.68] antibiotic it's rushing
[703.68 - 706.68] through
[707.56 - 713.64] okay and what happens is all these new
[711.68 - 718.04] bacteria
[713.64 - 721.64] right they don't budge everybody's happy
[718.04 - 723.96] they're stronger they supersede the
[721.64 - 726.48] antibiotic and then the doctor gets
[723.96 - 729.76] pissed the patients gets the patient
[726.48 - 731.84] gets pissed stays sick the doctor's
[729.76 - 735.48] pissed and then they change up the
[731.84 - 739.48] antibiotic get ready for this the new
[735.48 - 742.24] antibiotic gets then prescribed so here
[739.48 - 744.88] comes the new antibiotic coming through
[742.24 - 746.88] and this is what sucks right here really
[744.88 - 749.76] sucks it comes
[746.88 - 753.48] through and then it mimes
[749.76 - 756.04] and injures a whole bunch of them that's
[753.48 - 758.40] right this one gets maimed this one gets
[756.04 - 762.24] injured this one gets maimed this one
[758.40 - 764.40] gets injured this one gets almost killed
[762.24 - 768.24] completely this one just gets slightly
[764.40 - 769.48] injured this one never gets touched okay
[768.24 - 772.88] that's
[769.48 - 776.00] fine here's the problem now we got a
[772.88 - 778.40] whole bunch of brand new
[776.00 - 779.36] streps and those brand new bacterium
[778.40 - 781.68] strep
[779.36 - 785.60] bacterium have
[781.68 - 788.64] information and survived a new
[785.60 - 790.44] antibiotic that is not good they
[788.64 - 793.76] survived a new
[790.44 - 795.44] antibiotic they're still alive now they
[793.76 - 798.08] have information from the original
[795.44 - 800.40] antibiotic how to survive survival
[798.08 - 803.56] instincts in the bacteria and now they
[800.40 - 807.08] got new information from the new
[803.56 - 809.44] antibiotic survival mechanisms kick in
[807.08 - 812.44] in that bacteria the
[809.44 - 813.60] bacteria does not want to lose so it's
[812.44 - 817.64] going to now
[813.60 - 821.20] supersede and then boom the next phase
[817.64 - 823.04] happens okay you got a patient that's
[821.20 - 825.12] getting a little better again the
[823.04 - 829.40] patient's getting a little bit
[825.12 - 829.40] better I really can't stand this
[830.32 - 837.76] whiteboard
[832.64 - 839.28] yep all right new bacteria it's
[837.76 - 840.52] reproducing
[839.28 - 845.40] here we
[840.52 - 848.36] go once again immune system drops in the
[845.40 - 853.04] patient the patient was getting
[848.36 - 855.60] better a month later two months later at
[853.04 - 857.16] some point okay there's the bladder
[855.60 - 859.96] again I'm just doing a bladder you do
[857.16 - 861.12] kidneys you can do you know urethras
[859.96 - 863.88] whatever
[861.12 - 866.72] so all
[863.88 - 869.60] right playing around markers here so we
[866.72 - 873.20] got a new bacteria
[869.60 - 875.76] this bacteria has information from two
[873.20 - 879.24] antibiotics it has survived two
[875.76 - 882.00] antibiotics yes it has indeed and it has
[879.24 - 884.16] survived the person's immune
[882.00 - 886.44] system that's the whole point it
[884.16 - 888.36] survived their immune system and it
[886.44 - 890.80] survived the antibiotic involved in
[888.36 - 893.72] their immune system okay both with the
[890.80 - 895.84] immune system working on that working
[893.72 - 898.32] with that antibiotic and both with that
[895.84 - 900.80] antibiotic okay so get ready for this
[898.32 - 904.08] person get sick again they got another
[900.80 - 906.16] UTI it's pretty darn serious they're in
[904.08 - 909.76] pain they got a fever they don't know if
[906.16 - 912.84] they got kidney infections bladder
[909.76 - 915.84] infections and here we go there might be
[912.84 - 919.00] some blood in the urine
[915.84 - 922.44] right goes to the doctor doctor
[919.00 - 924.56] prescribes an antibiotic the same one
[922.44 - 926.88] that they used last time so you fill
[924.56 - 928.80] your prescription now you're taking it
[926.88 - 930.92] antibiotic runs through the body it's
[928.80 - 933.32] triggering the immune system immune
[930.92 - 934.64] cells you're trying to work with it it's
[933.32 - 935.80] trying to work with everything it's
[934.64 - 938.88] going
[935.80 - 940.00] through okay and this time now with this
[938.88 - 942.60] new
[940.00 - 944.64] antibiotic it's only killing off this
[942.60 - 947.04] one only killing off that one only
[944.64 - 950.24] killing off that one that one that one
[947.04 - 951.88] that one but this one right here is just
[950.24 - 953.92] injured that one's injured that one's
[951.88 - 956.40] injured that's one's injured injured
[953.92 - 959.24] maed and we got the whole thing over
[956.40 - 961.84] again all the maed and injured ones say
[959.24 - 964.56] I'm not going to do this anymore I'm not
[961.84 - 967.84] going to let this antibiotic this new
[964.56 - 970.48] antibiotic rule the roost and clean us
[967.84 - 973.20] out we have to Rise Above This and we
[970.48 - 976.84] have to get stronger and then what
[973.20 - 981.12] happens is the new reproduction of that
[976.84 - 984.84] of that bacterium is even stronger so
[981.12 - 986.68] that the next phase of the antibiotic on
[984.84 - 988.84] the fourth round which happens all the
[986.68 - 991.44] time and sometimes it's a sixth round
[988.84 - 994.68] sometimes it's a seven another one's
[991.44 - 997.92] prescribed here we
[994.68 - 1001.40] go and now none of the bacteria are
[997.92 - 1002.48] budging at all got a fever there's blood
[1001.40 - 1005.64] in the
[1002.48 - 1007.72] urine kidneys are inflamed they have to
[1005.64 - 1010.60] give steroids out now so now it's
[1007.72 - 1012.12] steroids plus the new antibiotics so
[1010.60 - 1014.92] here we go doctors's got to play the
[1012.12 - 1019.12] game again and here it
[1014.92 - 1021.44] comes right now it's time
[1019.12 - 1021.44] to
[1021.88 - 1027.44] use now it's time to use the new
[1025.16 - 1029.80] antibiotic all right so we got this
[1027.44 - 1031.24] bacteria that bacteria that bacteria
[1029.80 - 1034.56] that one right there that one right
[1031.24 - 1034.56] there there we go here's all the
[1034.96 - 1040.52] bacteria yep we got another bladder
[1038.48 - 1041.64] we'll just do bladder here we go there's
[1040.52 - 1046.00] the
[1041.64 - 1049.24] bladder now the doctor has to bring in
[1046.00 - 1051.84] the super antibiotic one with a lot of
[1049.24 - 1053.80] side effects one that causes a lot of
[1051.84 - 1056.96] problems one that also says a lot of
[1053.80 - 1060.12] terrible thing things on the side effect
[1056.96 - 1062.36] package the little roll out and here we
[1060.12 - 1065.88] go here it
[1062.36 - 1069.16] comes boom boom boom boom boom boom bo
[1065.88 - 1069.16] boom I'm taking my
[1070.60 - 1075.20] antibiotic
[1072.72 - 1080.04] right the super
[1075.20 - 1081.96] antibiotic the Super One a change
[1080.04 - 1086.84] up
[1081.96 - 1089.88] okay injures this guy kills off this guy
[1086.84 - 1092.08] mes this guy injures this guy kills off
[1089.88 - 1095.52] this guy doesn't even touch that guy
[1092.08 - 1098.44] that guy and that guy now you got three
[1095.52 - 1099.84] guys here not even being touched by the
[1098.44 - 1102.68] super
[1099.84 - 1104.68] antibiotic but you still got injured but
[1102.68 - 1107.76] not dead
[1104.68 - 1110.76] bacteria injured but not dead bacteria
[1107.76 - 1113.32] you got some dead
[1110.76 - 1115.48] bacteria but too many
[1113.32 - 1119.28] injured too many
[1115.48 - 1122.60] injured and too many maimed but still
[1119.28 - 1124.88] survived and others that didn't even get
[1122.60 - 1127.72] affected and then we got a big problem
[1124.88 - 1131.56] so now they reproduce
[1127.72 - 1135.84] again after the Super antibiotic went
[1131.56 - 1138.80] through they reproduce this time we're
[1135.84 - 1141.64] in trouble now big trouble here we we
[1138.80 - 1144.72] are because they use the super
[1141.64 - 1148.76] antibiotic again and then they have that
[1144.72 - 1151.72] running through and now these
[1148.76 - 1155.24] bacteria they have messaging they Cod it
[1151.72 - 1159.24] they have information they're
[1155.24 - 1162.52] superpowered they do not not give up at
[1159.24 - 1165.60] this point they have information of four
[1162.52 - 1165.60] to five different
[1166.12 - 1171.40] antibiotics and they don't want to budge
[1169.20 - 1174.72] anymore they put their foot down they're
[1171.40 - 1177.72] done that means they don't budge so then
[1174.72 - 1180.40] the doctor has to run another
[1177.72 - 1183.84] antibiotic brings that one
[1180.40 - 1187.04] through and now the patient is just
[1183.84 - 1190.32] chronically sick chronically suffering
[1187.04 - 1192.60] and chronically sick a super buug has
[1190.32 - 1192.60] been
[1194.32 - 1201.92] born the patient has the Super buug
[1199.32 - 1205.52] whether it's a male
[1201.92 - 1208.56] female the patient has a super buug and
[1205.52 - 1211.76] then the patient has a
[1208.56 - 1214.28] relationship or the patient is a chef
[1211.76 - 1216.48] working in a restaurant who cuts their
[1214.28 - 1217.84] finger and then bleeds on three
[1216.48 - 1219.36] different meals that you can't really
[1217.84 - 1220.84] tell because a lot of chefs they wear
[1219.36 - 1223.32] the black gloves they put the black
[1220.84 - 1224.68] gloves on they throw a bandage on put a
[1223.32 - 1226.16] black glove on there's still blood
[1224.68 - 1229.00] everywhere and they get working really
[1226.16 - 1232.08] quick they wipe their hands and or it's
[1229.00 - 1234.84] a relationship sexual interactions of
[1232.08 - 1237.16] some kind and then that super bug now
[1234.84 - 1238.80] gets transferred onto someone else with
[1237.16 - 1241.44] all this information and all this
[1238.80 - 1242.44] messaging and that information or the
[1241.44 - 1245.04] shopping
[1242.44 - 1247.04] cart shopping cart's a big one I've been
[1245.04 - 1251.12] saying this for decades you guys heard
[1247.04 - 1254.48] me say it years ago before c came around
[1251.12 - 1256.56] the shopping cart is a big one okay lots
[1254.48 - 1258.88] of different bacteria on there lots of
[1256.56 - 1261.20] strep lots of Staff lots of C diffs L
[1258.88 - 1263.88] lots of Mera lots of other stuff too but
[1261.20 - 1266.96] the strep is just crazy on the shopping
[1263.88 - 1270.32] cart handles crazy that's how much is on
[1266.96 - 1272.20] there okay so with that if they swabbed
[1270.32 - 1274.96] if they did a swab in a p tree dish if
[1272.20 - 1276.92] they did that like off the shopping cart
[1274.96 - 1280.56] handles you wouldn't believe what would
[1276.92 - 1281.64] grow wouldn't believe it so you're
[1280.56 - 1283.16] sitting there with a shopping cart
[1281.64 - 1284.84] handle you're not using handy wipes
[1283.16 - 1287.16] you're not doing an alcohol handy wipe
[1284.84 - 1288.28] across the handle you're you don't
[1287.16 - 1289.88] you're you're not thinking about
[1288.28 - 1291.00] anything you don't care about anything
[1289.88 - 1292.20] maybe you're just somebody that thinks
[1291.00 - 1293.52] that your immune system will get
[1292.20 - 1295.60] stronger because of it and you won't
[1293.52 - 1297.40] have to worry because hey who cares I
[1295.60 - 1299.20] can just eat bugs and have bugs all over
[1297.40 - 1301.56] my skin it's just all that whole thing
[1299.20 - 1304.28] that philosophy you know that philosophy
[1301.56 - 1305.72] right it makes you stronger you become
[1304.28 - 1307.64] immune to it or something like that
[1305.72 - 1309.60] that's not true that's not how it works
[1307.64 - 1311.40] the more exposure you get to these bugs
[1309.60 - 1313.80] the more exposure you get the more bugs
[1311.40 - 1315.76] you get the more problems than you have
[1313.80 - 1317.60] and then that it doesn't work that way
[1315.76 - 1319.16] where we're just all of a sudden hey I'm
[1317.60 - 1322.00] immune to everything and that's what I
[1319.16 - 1324.16] want all these bugs no it does not work
[1322.00 - 1326.72] like that tell that to someone who got
[1324.16 - 1328.40] you know Herpes Simplex 2 tell that to
[1326.72 - 1330.40] someone who's got something else that
[1328.40 - 1332.68] they caught from somebody it doesn't
[1330.40 - 1335.28] make you stronger it's not how it works
[1332.68 - 1338.92] it's a hassle it's all a hassle so then
[1335.28 - 1341.08] that strep then that super bug gets into
[1338.92 - 1344.20] somebody else through a shopping cart H
[1341.08 - 1347.32] handle through a public bathroom off the
[1344.20 - 1348.72] toilet seat off the dispenser whatever
[1347.32 - 1351.24] it is
[1348.72 - 1354.24] and they get it and they get the bug
[1351.24 - 1357.12] that's superpowered it is a super
[1354.24 - 1357.84] version of itself it already knows all
[1357.12 - 1359.96] the
[1357.84 - 1362.00] antibiotics it already knows about them
[1359.96 - 1364.40] all that means when you come down with
[1362.00 - 1366.80] something or you get sick or something
[1364.40 - 1369.60] happens and now you got a UTI whatever
[1366.80 - 1371.76] it may be you go to the doctor and the
[1369.60 - 1373.20] process starts all over again but the
[1371.76 - 1375.64] doctor starts giving you that first
[1373.20 - 1377.92] round of antibiotics and it won't budge
[1375.64 - 1379.24] so easy especially if you have a comprom
[1377.92 - 1381.64] rised immune system and you're already
[1379.24 - 1383.92] struggling with something it won't
[1381.64 - 1386.24] budge and they're just like why do you
[1383.92 - 1388.96] have these UTI all of a sudden or say
[1386.24 - 1390.72] you know someone has someone has sex
[1388.96 - 1393.60] with somebody else and you know is
[1390.72 - 1397.00] unprotective even if it's even if it's
[1393.60 - 1399.32] protected sex it's still easy to
[1397.00 - 1401.72] transfer these like these um these
[1399.32 - 1403.32] streps and this bacteria and all a
[1401.72 - 1406.16] sudden now there's a new UTI somebody
[1403.32 - 1408.96] has that never had before and now but
[1406.16 - 1411.92] it's an anti-resistant it's a what is it
[1408.96 - 1414.00] antibiotic resistant is what I mean
[1411.92 - 1416.36] version of itself that has all this
[1414.00 - 1419.24] information that's coded that's got all
[1416.36 - 1422.40] this Intel that survived all these
[1419.24 - 1425.28] antibiotics that knows them well so now
[1422.40 - 1427.56] we have another person with a super bug
[1425.28 - 1430.12] and just as Grim as it sounds it's not
[1427.56 - 1431.60] Grim when you know how to heal and use
[1430.12 - 1434.52] tools and that's the thing about medical
[1431.60 - 1437.24] medium information it's the one place
[1434.52 - 1439.76] where people that are the sickest come
[1437.24 - 1441.96] to find answers and it's not all that
[1439.76 - 1445.52] biohack [ __ ] out there that's going
[1441.96 - 1447.76] on it's real it's the real deal it's
[1445.52 - 1449.48] real answers real information on how to
[1447.76 - 1451.36] heal what to do and that's medical
[1449.48 - 1453.04] medium information and that's how it's
[1451.36 - 1454.48] always been people can be jealous out
[1453.04 - 1456.08] there and they can rip it apart or say
[1454.48 - 1457.80] what they want about it it Stills the
[1456.08 - 1460.52] most people healed in the world to the
[1457.80 - 1462.44] most chronic conditions and this is why
[1460.52 - 1466.04] knowing about this information not just
[1462.44 - 1467.96] biohacking crap on social and just this
[1466.04 - 1469.08] this this and try this it's for people
[1467.96 - 1470.80] who have been there and done that
[1469.08 - 1472.52] they're seasoned and they know so what
[1470.80 - 1475.08] happens is there is hope so when these
[1472.52 - 1476.48] super bugs the super strep gets to
[1475.08 - 1479.08] somebody else and they're fighting these
[1476.48 - 1481.00] these battling these UTI and it seems
[1479.08 - 1483.80] hopeless there are women out there with
[1481.00 - 1485.84] chronic UTI every day of their lives
[1483.80 - 1488.80] going into overactive
[1485.84 - 1491.60] bladder going into chronic UTI
[1488.80 - 1494.80] overactive bladder pain in their kidneys
[1491.60 - 1498.80] pain in their back PB and then it tack
[1494.80 - 1500.92] on acne and sore throats and sibo
[1498.80 - 1503.60] because they all get a sibo diagnosis
[1500.92 - 1505.88] eventually tuck on to all all those in
[1503.60 - 1508.56] there and they're living with these
[1505.88 - 1510.00] Super Bug streps it's happening more and
[1508.56 - 1512.12] more out there and there are more people
[1510.00 - 1515.12] living with this than ever before now
[1512.12 - 1519.00] there is an up surge that's getting out
[1515.12 - 1521.40] of control a serious upsurge and that
[1519.00 - 1523.04] upsurge is not going to stop it's going
[1521.40 - 1524.60] to keep on going unless people know how
[1523.04 - 1527.28] to arm themselves and take care of
[1524.60 - 1529.36] themselves and know how to fight feed
[1527.28 - 1530.76] their body what they need do the right
[1529.36 - 1533.00] things giving their bodies what their
[1530.76 - 1535.96] need so they can they can beat this
[1533.00 - 1537.92] Super Bug stuff down because it's no
[1535.96 - 1541.16] joke right now cuz people are passing
[1537.92 - 1543.84] these along and it's out of control
[1541.16 - 1545.52] people need the right information
[1543.84 - 1547.20] there's cleanse the heel right here in
[1545.52 - 1549.88] front of me and in cleanse the heel it
[1547.20 - 1552.24] got pelvic inflammatory disease right
[1549.88 - 1554.88] and even you know PID right and even
[1552.24 - 1557.20] prostatitis got that there too and I'm
[1554.88 - 1559.64] talking about bladder infections UTI all
[1557.20 - 1562.76] of that in here so it's cleanse to heal
[1559.64 - 1564.92] people need this book they need the
[1562.76 - 1566.16] information I have Liver Rescue in front
[1564.92 - 1568.24] of me right here I want to read a little
[1566.16 - 1569.60] bit about this for a couple of minutes
[1568.24 - 1572.24] if you guys don't
[1569.60 - 1574.72] mind the story of
[1572.24 - 1578.20] strep is what I was just telling you
[1574.72 - 1580.20] guys that's the story of strep right now
[1578.20 - 1584.00] in this modern day what people are
[1580.20 - 1586.40] dealing with and how bad it is okay most
[1584.00 - 1588.28] people strep starts in childhood they
[1586.40 - 1590.56] get the ear infections to get the strep
[1588.28 - 1593.20] throat the sore throats it starts
[1590.56 - 1595.80] earlier on it strep passed down from the
[1593.20 - 1597.92] parents a lot of times and it's strep
[1595.80 - 1600.08] that's passed down to the parents and
[1597.92 - 1602.20] then the children the B the children
[1600.08 - 1603.48] have it and the children pass it to each
[1602.20 - 1606.24] other in
[1603.48 - 1608.56] school and so it's it's strep being
[1606.24 - 1612.04] passed around everywhere that's what it
[1608.56 - 1615.12] is but that could be fine in some ways
[1612.04 - 1617.08] but in others it's antibiotic resistance
[1615.12 - 1618.56] STP that's being passed around going to
[1617.08 - 1620.16] each person then that takes us to the
[1618.56 - 1621.68] next level of understanding which I want
[1620.16 - 1625.56] to go to
[1621.68 - 1627.84] now which is the immune system okay
[1625.56 - 1631.08] that's the next thing every time SHP
[1627.84 - 1634.92] enters into somebody and battles our
[1631.08 - 1637.88] immune cells and it survives so anytime
[1634.92 - 1642.40] SHP enters into each person and it goes
[1637.88 - 1645.40] into war with our immune cells right
[1642.40 - 1648.28] here goes into war every time that
[1645.40 - 1651.48] happens and there's a battle and the
[1648.28 - 1653.64] strep survives it has information so
[1651.48 - 1655.36] when that strep is passed on to another
[1653.64 - 1658.32] person it's not just
[1655.36 - 1660.56] antibiotics it's also relationships with
[1658.32 - 1664.24] the immune system of the person it was
[1660.56 - 1666.72] in this whole time so then when that STP
[1664.24 - 1669.20] gets passed on to somebody else it's
[1666.72 - 1672.28] getting passed on to somebody else with
[1669.20 - 1675.04] information on that person's immune
[1672.28 - 1677.24] system information of how it survived
[1675.04 - 1678.72] the battle with that person's white
[1677.24 - 1681.56] count
[1678.72 - 1684.68] and so when that strep is in the new
[1681.56 - 1686.44] person the strep now has a way to beat
[1684.68 - 1688.12] immune systems it goes into another
[1686.44 - 1690.56] person another person's immune system
[1688.12 - 1693.32] goes up against it there it goes it's in
[1690.56 - 1695.24] battle the the bacteria survives why do
[1693.32 - 1697.24] you think people keep on getting acne
[1695.24 - 1699.20] all over again they still have some
[1697.24 - 1701.84] strep surviving what do you think they
[1699.20 - 1704.88] keep on getting the UTI over again the
[1701.84 - 1709.00] bladder infections the overactive
[1704.88 - 1710.80] bladder right that one to OAB they keep
[1709.00 - 1713.08] on getting these things and then the
[1710.80 - 1714.68] thigh and then the sore throats and then
[1713.08 - 1717.32] the strep throat periodically and then
[1714.68 - 1719.20] the earaches and ear infections or they
[1717.32 - 1721.72] get exposed to new strains and that's
[1719.20 - 1724.16] another story and we'll go into that too
[1721.72 - 1726.56] the strep has information of the
[1724.16 - 1729.00] person's immune system information of
[1726.56 - 1731.24] the antibiotics the other person took
[1729.00 - 1733.60] they take it to the next person the next
[1731.24 - 1737.44] person's immune cells go against it they
[1733.60 - 1739.60] go into battle what survives is Boom the
[1737.44 - 1742.28] bacteria again some of it survives it
[1739.60 - 1744.20] gets passed on to a new person with now
[1742.28 - 1747.32] immune system information from two
[1744.20 - 1749.24] others now here's where it gets really
[1747.32 - 1753.36] intense that
[1749.24 - 1757.60] bacteria can go through a 100 people and
[1753.36 - 1761.04] gather information from their immune
[1757.60 - 1765.40] systems of that 100
[1761.04 - 1769.04] people that's how super bugs are made
[1765.40 - 1771.92] it's not just the antibiotic over
[1769.04 - 1774.28] usage and then the UN and then not being
[1771.92 - 1775.56] taught how to heal and get rid of the
[1774.28 - 1778.76] bacteria
[1775.56 - 1782.84] naturally it's also information from
[1778.76 - 1788.16] each person's immune cells to each
[1782.84 - 1791.88] person and that bug becomes one
[1788.16 - 1793.32] Unstoppable brutal bug and that's why
[1791.88 - 1796.56] there are women out there young women in
[1793.32 - 1799.12] their 20s and in their early 30s that
[1796.56 - 1802.40] are in years on a daily basis and they
[1799.12 - 1806.08] are so sick and they have so much
[1802.40 - 1809.00] UTI chronic UTI going on they have so
[1806.08 - 1812.04] much overactive badder UTI kidney
[1809.00 - 1813.72] infection sore throats molay tired
[1812.04 - 1815.12] fatigue everything else Under the Sun
[1813.72 - 1816.84] with it and they're suffering and
[1815.12 - 1818.20] they're bleeding they're on antibiotics
[1816.84 - 1819.44] again their stomach's being ripped a
[1818.20 - 1821.44] shreds from the
[1819.44 - 1824.04] antibiotics then they get their sibo
[1821.44 - 1826.08] diagnoses and it's all around the same
[1824.04 - 1828.28] old thing more antibiotics for that and
[1826.08 - 1829.72] they're suffering
[1828.28 - 1832.24] and then
[1829.72 - 1833.64] because they got a strep inside of them
[1832.24 - 1835.44] that could have been through a hundred
[1833.64 - 1838.60] people that was passed on to them one
[1835.44 - 1841.16] way or another and that strep is smart
[1838.60 - 1843.92] it's smart it knows the immune cell
[1841.16 - 1846.48] information from dozens of people it
[1843.92 - 1849.76] knows the antibiotic information from
[1846.48 - 1851.84] dozens of people and it carries it with
[1849.76 - 1853.76] it and we have to know how to destroy
[1851.84 - 1857.36] that bacteria and how to kill it and
[1853.76 - 1859.12] what to use that it is not immune to
[1857.36 - 1861.92] because that's the key right medical
[1859.12 - 1864.52] medum information is always about the
[1861.92 - 1869.32] cause because guess what they didn't
[1864.52 - 1872.32] know strep was a UTI problem they didn't
[1869.32 - 1874.16] know strep was other problems they knew
[1872.32 - 1877.60] about strep throat but they didn't know
[1874.16 - 1879.92] strep created acne they didn't know it
[1877.60 - 1881.84] created sty did they didn't know it
[1879.92 - 1883.24] created UTI by the way that's medical
[1881.84 - 1886.12] medium
[1883.24 - 1887.52] information but it does it's just coming
[1886.12 - 1888.56] out people are poaching it and it's
[1887.52 - 1889.96] going out there and it's just getting
[1888.56 - 1891.04] out there every day just like you guys
[1889.96 - 1892.68] are probably seeing because I know you
[1891.04 - 1894.12] guys are telling me you see it every day
[1892.68 - 1897.48] we see it every
[1894.12 - 1899.84] day but the point is is that bacteria we
[1897.48 - 1902.40] have to learn how to kill it you have to
[1899.84 - 1905.44] identify it and know there's a cause
[1902.40 - 1906.40] behind your PID there's a cause behind
[1905.44 - 1909.92] your
[1906.40 - 1913.40] UTI there's a cause Behind these
[1909.92 - 1916.16] things and there's a way to kill and
[1913.40 - 1918.84] destroy kill and destroy the
[1916.16 - 1921.40] bacteria even bacterium that is
[1918.84 - 1923.76] antibiotic resistant and knows a crap
[1921.40 - 1925.96] ton of people's immune systems that
[1923.76 - 1927.76] understands all these people's immune
[1925.96 - 1928.68] systems that that bacteria was in all
[1927.76 - 1932.56] this
[1928.68 - 1934.48] time understands it is an expert at
[1932.56 - 1937.28] immune systems because that's what the
[1934.48 - 1940.32] bacteria becomes it becomes an expert at
[1937.28 - 1943.72] everybody's white count immune cells all
[1940.32 - 1946.48] of it it knows it all it's been in too
[1943.72 - 1948.00] many people it hasn't been destroyed and
[1946.48 - 1949.56] it's gotten stronger and stronger now
[1948.00 - 1951.84] it's a super bug and that's where it's
[1949.56 - 1953.48] at and that's happening now every day
[1951.84 - 1955.96] and we think these super bugs are bad
[1953.48 - 1957.08] now wait till the next round of UTI 10
[1955.96 - 1960.68] years from
[1957.08 - 1964.52] now and all the young men and women it's
[1960.68 - 1967.32] going to be like nobody's ever seen ever
[1964.52 - 1969.16] seen it's going to be that bad it's
[1967.32 - 1972.56] going to be bleeding is normal
[1969.16 - 1975.12] constantly bleeding catheters constantly
[1972.56 - 1977.48] on catheters that's another thing too so
[1975.12 - 1979.56] the UTI are getting to a point where all
[1977.48 - 1982.04] these young women are are literally
[1979.56 - 1984.72] living with
[1982.04 - 1988.28] catheters that's how bad it
[1984.72 - 1989.60] is and so we have to be mindful and
[1988.28 - 1991.00] understand that there is a way to beat
[1989.60 - 1992.36] it and there is a way to do we're going
[1991.00 - 1994.52] to talk about that in a little bit but I
[1992.36 - 1998.76] want to read a little if I
[1994.52 - 2001.68] can okay maybe most people strep starts
[1998.76 - 2004.72] in childhood maybe even pass down from a
[2001.68 - 2007.04] parent at conception yes a newborn can
[2004.72 - 2008.64] enter the world at strep already in her
[2007.04 - 2011.52] or his
[2008.64 - 2014.44] system a child can also get strep from
[2011.52 - 2018.20] daycare or school and it's easily passed
[2014.44 - 2020.88] from child to child it really is as well
[2018.20 - 2024.08] as adult to adult because strep is a
[2020.88 - 2026.52] type of bacterium antibiotics do seem
[2024.08 - 2028.96] like the obvious choice to treat it but
[2026.52 - 2032.12] here's the crucial point that I talked
[2028.96 - 2034.72] about to know about strep long ago
[2032.12 - 2036.60] before antibiotic Revolution before
[2034.72 - 2039.08] antibiotics long ago you guys this is
[2036.60 - 2042.36] really interesting right here before the
[2039.08 - 2045.80] antibiotic was born long
[2042.36 - 2050.04] ago strep used to be one strain of
[2045.80 - 2052.28] bacterium strep was one strain of
[2050.04 - 2053.56] bacterium which takes us to this next
[2052.28 - 2057.00] part right here and now this is really
[2053.56 - 2059.16] important okay this is
[2057.00 - 2061.16] important very
[2059.16 - 2063.72] important I'm going to bring this around
[2061.16 - 2067.80] for a second
[2063.72 - 2072.04] okay all right so
[2067.80 - 2074.76] five antibiotics ago 10 antibiotics ago
[2072.04 - 2076.60] 10 different people ago the bacteria
[2074.76 - 2080.92] look like
[2076.60 - 2085.36] this right but then it changes a new
[2080.92 - 2089.60] strain is is is created along
[2085.36 - 2093.24] with the superbug power it alters and
[2089.60 - 2094.44] turns into a different bug now we have
[2093.24 - 2096.88] the old
[2094.44 - 2099.92] strain that's way in the past and it's
[2096.88 - 2102.28] and other people we got the new
[2099.92 - 2106.44] strain and there it
[2102.28 - 2106.44] is right there that new
[2107.48 - 2112.28] strain becomes another new strain
[2109.92 - 2114.92] eventually another new strain another
[2112.28 - 2117.76] new strain but here's the thing if you
[2114.92 - 2120.52] pass on this strain that it became to
[2117.76 - 2122.68] another person through sex or through
[2120.52 - 2125.44] drinking from somebody's glass or from
[2122.68 - 2127.16] being in a bar and eating something or
[2125.44 - 2128.92] whatever you're doing in a restaurant or
[2127.16 - 2130.84] on a shopping cart in a shopping cart or
[2128.92 - 2132.16] in a public bathroom or so many other
[2130.84 - 2135.28] ways you can do
[2132.16 - 2138.64] this if you pass on that strep bacteria
[2135.28 - 2141.72] to somebody in that in that strain to
[2138.64 - 2144.92] them they'll have that
[2141.72 - 2148.24] strain and they may keep that strain but
[2144.92 - 2152.48] it'll be that strain okay these in this
[2148.24 - 2156.48] person can still alter and become a new
[2152.48 - 2158.60] strain in a few years that new strain
[2156.48 - 2160.20] can be passed on to another person and
[2158.60 - 2161.84] then they'll have that
[2160.20 - 2165.36] strain
[2161.84 - 2165.36] see that's how it
[2167.72 - 2174.80] works men can get UTI too and they do
[2171.28 - 2176.32] but they don't have a cycle men do not
[2174.80 - 2179.76] have
[2176.32 - 2181.24] menstruation they do not have a cycle so
[2179.76 - 2183.08] they don't have the immune system
[2181.24 - 2184.40] lowering thing that happens so what
[2183.08 - 2186.00] happens is when a woman goes for
[2184.40 - 2188.56] menstration and she has her cycle her
[2186.00 - 2190.32] monthly cycle immune system drops and
[2188.56 - 2191.92] 80% of our immune system goes to the
[2190.32 - 2193.96] reproductive system that's medical medum
[2191.92 - 2195.64] information 20% stays around the body
[2193.96 - 2197.36] for the rest of the body the
[2195.64 - 2199.64] reproductive system is the number one
[2197.36 - 2202.52] Focus that time a month where it's the
[2199.64 - 2205.76] number one Focus for the immune system
[2202.52 - 2207.56] think about that right so because of
[2205.76 - 2209.32] that the immune system is so focused
[2207.56 - 2211.84] around the reproductive
[2209.32 - 2212.84] system okay that it's easy to catch
[2211.84 - 2216.40] strap
[2212.84 - 2218.04] orally very easy to catch it orally or
[2216.40 - 2219.68] in the eyes where the immune system
[2218.04 - 2221.68] isn't there to destroy it right off the
[2219.68 - 2223.60] running so if there's some kind of
[2221.68 - 2225.08] relationship or a shopping cart like I
[2223.60 - 2226.60] said or a public bathroom and something
[2225.08 - 2230.64] goes in the eye or something gets in the
[2226.60 - 2232.64] mouth whatever it is during the cycle
[2230.64 - 2235.32] 80% of the immune system isn't around
[2232.64 - 2238.28] the mouth it's not there so for a woman
[2235.32 - 2241.68] it's not here it's down here so the
[2238.28 - 2243.88] strep can easily start its it's
[2241.68 - 2246.24] beginning in the mouth in the throat and
[2243.88 - 2248.32] the so for so forth in that area so that
[2246.24 - 2249.16] happens too all right let's go into just
[2248.32 - 2252.80] a little
[2249.16 - 2256.68] bit all right here's the crucial point
[2252.80 - 2259.24] to know about strep long ago before the
[2256.68 - 2261.88] antibiotic Revolution I'm reading out of
[2259.24 - 2263.20] Liver Rescue if you guys never seen
[2261.88 - 2265.24] these books you don't know about these
[2263.20 - 2267.28] books you should get both of them go to
[2265.24 - 2270.12] Amazon get both be the best thing you
[2267.28 - 2272.88] ever did become an expert about your own
[2270.12 - 2277.00] health learn how to
[2272.88 - 2279.36] heal become a true expert a true expert
[2277.00 - 2279.36] not a
[2279.84 - 2286.20] biohacker SHP is not and never was a
[2283.36 - 2290.36] super buug in the past so strep was
[2286.20 - 2292.80] never a super buug it's not designed to
[2290.36 - 2295.64] be a Super Bug originally it was never
[2292.80 - 2299.60] meant to be one we are forcing it to
[2295.64 - 2303.44] become a super buug
[2299.60 - 2306.36] okay it's much more forgiving strep than
[2303.44 - 2308.40] ever than anything else was okay and
[2306.36 - 2310.92] it's original state going back many
[2308.40 - 2313.40] years ago it was much more forgiving
[2310.92 - 2317.24] it's a forgiving
[2313.40 - 2320.48] bacterium it's not as unforgiving as
[2317.24 - 2324.72] merca it's not as unforgiving as Mera so
[2320.48 - 2328.04] that is something to understand cith and
[2324.72 - 2331.92] Mera can be even much more brutal much
[2328.04 - 2336.12] more brutal of a superbug stre still
[2331.92 - 2339.40] even with its worst superbug mentality
[2336.12 - 2343.48] whatever it's more superbug
[2339.40 - 2346.80] creation it doesn't hold the power as
[2343.48 - 2349.28] like Mera and what MCA can turn into
[2346.80 - 2352.60] some kind of flesh eating bacterium that
[2349.28 - 2355.60] just becomes a super super bug so I want
[2352.60 - 2357.80] that clear so people
[2355.60 - 2358.96] know so if they got strep and they're
[2357.80 - 2360.88] living with strep they're living with
[2358.96 - 2363.08] all these symptoms you can turn it in it
[2360.88 - 2364.72] can turn naturally into a Super Bug over
[2363.08 - 2367.08] time because it's force-fed the
[2364.72 - 2370.20] antibiotics it's force fed
[2367.08 - 2373.56] in the way I was saying all those things
[2370.20 - 2375.80] but it won't get to like a Mera level at
[2373.56 - 2377.96] merca's worst so the different varieties
[2375.80 - 2380.36] of Mera there's all these different
[2377.96 - 2383.24] varieties of Mera did you know there's
[2380.36 - 2386.12] thousands of varieties of Mera and some
[2383.24 - 2390.72] of the top tier varieties of Mera that
[2386.12 - 2392.64] are just like God awful and they kill
[2390.72 - 2394.48] people is what they do and they give
[2392.64 - 2397.80] them sepsis and then they die they like
[2394.48 - 2401.32] the top tier of the worst shp's not
[2397.80 - 2404.96] there so I wanted that to be
[2401.32 - 2406.60] clear but SHP is no longer one strain I
[2404.96 - 2408.84] want to go back to that a little bit
[2406.60 - 2411.72] it's no longer one
[2408.84 - 2414.44] strain there are so many varieties of
[2411.72 - 2417.08] strep at this point over the
[2414.44 - 2419.60] decades strep being a victim of
[2417.08 - 2422.04] antibiotics it found a way to survive to
[2419.60 - 2424.12] adapt adaptation didn't just mean
[2422.04 - 2426.48] getting stronger it meant mutating and
[2424.12 - 2428.76] spawning different strains and varieties
[2426.48 - 2432.16] and that's what strep does it's the
[2428.76 - 2435.60] ultimate like spawner of new varieties
[2432.16 - 2439.00] of bacteria all strep all the same
[2435.60 - 2440.84] family but it's the ultimate see heal
[2439.00 - 2443.64] with Mariana says over there on IG I
[2440.84 - 2446.12] healed my UTI back in 2002 with the
[2443.64 - 2449.68] herbs and supplements you recommend in
[2446.12 - 2453.32] cleanse the heel book amazing is it
[2449.68 - 2456.04] 2020 let see what it is um healing with
[2453.32 - 2457.96] Victoria I used to be on an antibiotic
[2456.04 - 2459.80] once once a month for UTI I haven't
[2457.96 - 2461.64] needed them in four years thanks to your
[2459.80 - 2464.76] protocols thanks to you and so because
[2461.64 - 2467.84] medical M information destroys UTI just
[2464.76 - 2469.48] destroys them so one thing about mm info
[2467.84 - 2471.12] if you know how to use it and you use it
[2469.48 - 2473.48] right you can annihilate so many
[2471.12 - 2476.04] different strep
[2473.48 - 2480.28] conditions Shamrock over there in IG
[2476.04 - 2482.52] this was me with IC whoa I see for 20

[2512.52 - 2517.88] working that's the power of it you know
[2515.24 - 2519.32] biohackers an informationist messing
[2517.88 - 2521.88] around all these different things out
[2519.32 - 2523.68] there on social can do that for people
[2521.88 - 2525.56] this information does and that's why I'm
[2523.68 - 2527.72] a messenger of s so's information
[2525.56 - 2530.12] because it saves lives Maria over there

[2535.32 - 2540.20] incredible let's go into a little bit of
[2537.32 - 2541.80] protocol talk a little bit too let's
[2540.20 - 2544.28] just double check we covered some stuff
[2541.80 - 2545.72] right here let's talk about like the
[2544.28 - 2547.92] different strains a little bit longer
[2545.72 - 2549.56] the spa the different strains I want to
[2547.92 - 2550.96] go into that over there on YouTube
[2549.56 - 2553.24] wondering wishing good to see you
[2550.96 - 2556.28] antibiotics used to be the go-to for our
[2553.24 - 2560.00] family after medical meeting protocols

[2567.92 - 2572.48] doctor appointments thanks s so and
[2570.40 - 2575.00] medical
[2572.48 - 2578.96] medium it's going to get me
[2575.00 - 2582.32] emotional the because you know when you
[2578.96 - 2584.88] heal it is everything Maria over there
[2582.32 - 2586.88] on YouTube great topic I used to get UTI
[2584.88 - 2591.72] oh I saw that one already great Chrissy
[2586.88 - 2594.52] over there and I think um twitch Stitch
[2591.72 - 2597.92] Chrissy I was in tears every time I had
[2594.52 - 2600.40] a UTI I can't imagine the amount of
[2597.92 - 2603.12] people that are going through it and
[2600.40 - 2606.72] they go through it on levels that are
[2603.12 - 2610.92] just devastating it's become like Super
[2606.72 - 2612.88] Bug now level and it's brutal and so
[2610.92 - 2614.52] many people suffer from it their guts
[2612.88 - 2616.24] get ripped to shreds from all the
[2614.52 - 2619.16] antibiotics they have to take they're on
[2616.24 - 2620.92] steroids almost all the time and it's
[2619.16 - 2623.20] brutal along the way strep got
[2620.92 - 2627.08] classified as having a group a and a
[2623.20 - 2629.44] group b yeah the medical world now
[2627.08 - 2631.24] identifies strep all the way through
[2629.44 - 2635.32] Group
[2631.24 - 2638.16] H Group H though as you read about in
[2635.32 - 2641.24] the acne chapter cuz acne is Strep
[2638.16 - 2644.16] caused by the way you guys it is it's
[2641.24 - 2646.16] medical medum info but it's strep caused
[2644.16 - 2649.48] that the population carries there are
[2646.16 - 2651.28] also strains within the known groups
[2649.48 - 2653.36] that are yet un that are yet
[2651.28 - 2655.32] unidentified and undocumented so here's
[2653.36 - 2657.80] how medicine
[2655.32 - 2661.44] works medical research and science works
[2657.80 - 2664.40] like this they've classified some of the
[2661.44 - 2666.64] bacterium the strains but they haven't
[2664.40 - 2669.04] classified all of them haven't even
[2666.64 - 2671.76] scratched the surface so the bacteria
[2669.04 - 2674.00] out there that they haven't even
[2671.76 - 2675.32] documented classified got their hands on
[2674.00 - 2677.68] or anything like that and that's the
[2675.32 - 2680.68] scary thing it's even
[2677.68 - 2684.36] scarier yep even a gifted and talented
[2680.68 - 2687.08] lab technician discovered that even if a
[2684.36 - 2688.48] gifted and talented lab technician
[2687.08 - 2690.00] discovered that there were more strains
[2688.48 - 2692.32] and groups of strep that weren't
[2690.00 - 2694.72] currently known the Breakthrough would
[2692.32 - 2696.72] go unrecognized the scientists would not
[2694.72 - 2698.56] be able to find funding for this area of
[2696.72 - 2700.48] critical medical importance because
[2698.56 - 2705.00] right now funding is too tied up in
[2700.48 - 2707.72] misled areas like how genes relate to
[2705.00 - 2710.40] disease so yeah you guys let's go into
[2707.72 - 2712.04] this a little bit now some protocol
[2710.40 - 2715.24] stuff I'm in cleans to heal if you don't
[2712.04 - 2718.24] have the book I feel bad for
[2715.24 - 2721.68] you get the book get the book get the
[2718.24 - 2724.92] book I mean you don't have to spend a
[2721.68 - 2726.96] $5,000 program on how to walk Barefoot
[2724.92 - 2728.40] on your on your lawn
[2726.96 - 2732.28] you can do that but it won't make your
[2728.40 - 2734.20] UTI go away keep that in mind you can do
[2732.28 - 2736.28] earth and you can do like you can would
[2734.20 - 2738.12] not wear shoes and you can watch the
[2736.28 - 2740.64] sunrise in the morning and you can angle
[2738.12 - 2743.08] your bed a certain way in your room the
[2740.64 - 2744.24] way the sunrises and sun sun sets but
[2743.08 - 2748.88] none of that's going to get rid of
[2744.24 - 2752.84] somebody's de debilitating acne sty UTI
[2748.88 - 2757.44] bladder infections kidney infections
[2752.84 - 2760.84] P it's just not going to happen
[2757.44 - 2762.52] hardcore stuff that has to work then you
[2760.84 - 2767.00] can do all that stuff for fun the other
[2762.52 - 2769.84] stuff I was mentioning okay danan 144 on
[2767.00 - 2772.44] IG I was in so much pain for nine months
[2769.84 - 2773.68] with interstial cystis celery juice
[2772.44 - 2776.68] saved my
[2773.68 - 2778.60] life yeah and that's why when someone
[2776.68 - 2780.32] says celery juice sucks or celery juice
[2778.60 - 2782.68] isn't what it is or something out there
[2780.32 - 2786.04] that's it's actually such a disservice
[2782.68 - 2787.88] to the chronically ill it's so sad when
[2786.04 - 2792.04] celery juice literally has turned lives
[2787.88 - 2793.88] around saved lives yeah I know all right
[2792.04 - 2797.84] let's go into it pelvic inflammatory
[2793.88 - 2800.12] disease PID right here talks about UTI
[2797.84 - 2803.96] it's in here right here cleanse the
[2800.12 - 2807.64] heel all right the true cause bacterial
[2803.96 - 2809.68] infection of one or more strains from
[2807.64 - 2812.44] over 50 groups of
[2809.68 - 2816.68] strep there are different levels of
[2812.44 - 2818.52] PID it's like different levels of UTI
[2816.68 - 2822.28] different levels to all the different
[2818.52 - 2822.28] things different levels to
[2822.84 - 2827.60] sibo incredible okay so let's go into
[2825.12 - 2830.96] the protocol right starts out
[2827.60 - 2835.08] interesting fresh celery
[2830.96 - 2835.08] juice I still have some left right

[2880.28 - 2889.48] PID for overactive bladder too aloe vera
[2885.52 - 2893.04] two or more inches of fresh gel skin
[2889.48 - 2894.60] removed two or more inches of fresh gel
[2893.04 - 2897.24] skin
[2894.60 - 2901.20] removed all right what's the next thing
[2897.24 - 2904.24] on the list barleygrass juice
[2901.20 - 2909.04] powder another thing on the list cat's
[2904.24 - 2911.04] claw very interesting cat's claw
[2909.04 - 2913.36] critical for
[2911.04 - 2918.36] UTI critical for
[2913.36 - 2921.72] PID critical for men that are having
[2918.36 - 2923.32] prostatitis right there cat's claw it's
[2921.72 - 2925.12] a big one you'll hear more about cats
[2923.32 - 2926.64] claw every day out there and more about
[2925.12 - 2928.68] cats claw every day it's the medical
[2926.64 - 2931.28] medium information that got that out
[2928.68 - 2933.60] there catclaw was around it's been
[2931.28 - 2935.12] around obviously but using it for the
[2933.60 - 2936.84] things that it's being used for for
[2935.12 - 2940.48] protocol false is medical medium
[2936.84 - 2942.84] information originally for cat's claw
[2940.48 - 2946.84] curcumin and there you go that's another
[2942.84 - 2950.04] one de Manos yeah de Manos is
[2946.84 - 2952.16] great but you need more than deos if
[2950.04 - 2953.36] someone's dealing with UTI and pib and
[2952.16 - 2954.92] some of the things I'm talking about
[2953.36 - 2957.16] here you need more than de Manos de
[2954.92 - 2959.36] Manos is in here it's part of the
[2957.16 - 2960.92] protocol and sometimes you'll hear out
[2959.36 - 2964.36] there like a practitioner or somebody
[2960.92 - 2965.92] will say de Manos use that for your UTI
[2964.36 - 2967.92] it's like okay but what about about the
[2965.92 - 2972.16] golden
[2967.92 - 2975.64] seal what about the cat's claw where's
[2972.16 - 2978.28] that what about the celery juice de
[2975.64 - 2980.88] Manos Dem Manos drink cranberry juice
[2978.28 - 2984.04] drink cranberry juice that's great and
[2980.88 - 2986.04] all that's great but guess what it's not
[2984.04 - 2988.24] enough for the kind of UTI that are
[2986.04 - 2990.92] happening out there every day right now
[2988.24 - 2993.60] no way it's not enough but it is when
[2990.92 - 2996.04] it's compiled with other things it helps
[2993.60 - 2998.20] right right
[2996.04 - 3000.16] and the books have the amounts to C but
[2998.20 - 3001.60] you customize I talk about the amounts
[3000.16 - 3005.24] in here but you
[3001.60 - 3009.04] customize over there n g Elena I had
[3005.24 - 3012.32] several severe PID which went to left
[3009.04 - 3015.60] kidney too o I was told I need
[3012.32 - 3022.48] hysterectomy and will be disabled heal
[3015.60 - 3022.48] that with mm now all I need is to heal G
[3022.72 - 3028.72] AOS or it says GBS AOS
[3026.68 - 3030.60] all right ibrite it's another one right
[3028.72 - 3033.32] there golden
[3030.60 - 3035.16] seal golden
[3033.32 - 3038.40] seal
[3035.16 - 3040.48] UTI golden
[3038.40 - 3043.72] seal
[3040.48 - 3045.92] UTI golden
[3043.72 - 3048.48] seal why do I do
[3045.92 - 3050.40] that people just they get lost they
[3048.48 - 3052.84] don't hear something they don't know
[3050.40 - 3055.60] they get a UTI next month don't even
[3052.84 - 3057.36] remember so I'm hoping if you're one of
[3055.60 - 3059.24] those people you'll be able to save
[3057.36 - 3062.04] yourself
[3059.24 - 3064.80] UTI golden
[3062.04 - 3068.00] seal so I talk about here dosages
[3064.80 - 3070.72] everything okay remember the quality of
[3068.00 - 3072.48] supplements matter so check out medical
[3070.72 - 3073.76] mem information but the quality of the
[3072.48 - 3076.84] supplements
[3073.76 - 3079.00] matter critical I talk about that in the
[3076.84 - 3082.80] supplements chapter in cleanse the heel
[3079.00 - 3086.16] make sure you look at that really
[3082.80 - 3090.20] important another one
[3086.16 - 3093.60] strep UTI PID overactive bladder all
[3090.20 - 3099.16] these lemon
[3093.60 - 3101.60] bomb UTI lemon bomb okay ready UTI
[3099.16 - 3101.60] licorice
[3103.60 - 3109.84] root licorice root ETI nettle
[3110.04 - 3114.04] Leaf
[3111.68 - 3115.76] incredible and there's more in here too
[3114.04 - 3118.04] that you can play with cust cize
[3115.76 - 3121.16] yourself it's here the information that
[3118.04 - 3126.52] s SOC brought to us to save people's
[3121.16 - 3128.68] lives I get it fun you know surfing the
[3126.52 - 3133.08] net surfing
[3128.68 - 3136.00] social whoa let me cold plunge you know
[3133.08 - 3138.32] whoa let me walk Barefoot it's all great
[3136.00 - 3140.36] whatever cold punching is not good it's
[3138.32 - 3142.36] not good for people chronically sick all
[3140.36 - 3145.64] that stuff but either
[3142.36 - 3147.12] way I'm talking about fixing problems
[3145.64 - 3149.24] and that's the key and that's what the
[3147.12 - 3151.60] medical medium information does fixes
[3149.24 - 3154.24] problems keep that in mind Amy over
[3151.60 - 3156.56] there on IG friend with
