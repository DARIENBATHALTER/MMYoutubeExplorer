i'll take more b12 than i usually do but

150
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
you can do them straight in your mouth

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
like this

152
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,479

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080

water too so i recommend that too i

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,639

you're cleaning up

562
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,679
the liver with the celery juice part of

563
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,200
the protocol right there okay

564
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,080
okay ashwagandha is in this protocol

565
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,520
ashwagandha right so this is the vimergy

566
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
ashwagandha

567
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,200
this one's a new bottle i just brought

568
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,400
out because these are supplements i take

569
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,520
too obviously quality matters

570
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
so

571
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
it really matters

572
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,960
this is a

573
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,440
incredible product they have i'm not

574
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,039
sponsored

575
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
right i'm putting a dropper full right

576
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,240
there what does it say here it says ash

577
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
there there's no alcohol no additives

579
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,600
nothing bad like that incredible stuff

580
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,679
but it's

581
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,360
i don't i don't want to waste your time

582
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,880
talking about the quality quality levels

583
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
incredible but i want to talk about the

584
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,360
protocol

585
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
i just did one dropper full of

586
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
ashwagandha in there so this is where

587
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,440
hot flashes this is for

588
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,039
chills and night sweats running hot body

589
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,799
temperature fluctuations this what this

590
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,720
is what i would do if i had any of that

591
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,159
if i had hot flashes all through the

592
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,159
night

593
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,679

so i just did that i put a little bit of

598
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,600

can't be it can't be beat anywhere yet

606
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
i'm waiting for companies to actually

607
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
try to supersede the quality here on

608
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,000
this because if when they do i'll start

609
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,880
recommending them i'll recommend them

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,919
right away if a company can match

611
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,120
vimergy or beat them i will recommend

612
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
them

613
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
check out the medical meme directory if

614
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,679
you want to check that out

615
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
medicalmeme.com the directory there so

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,200
okay that's one thing right there right

617
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,799
cat's claw interesting

618
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,559
why is cat's claw in hot flashes chills

619
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,559
night sweats running hot body

620
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,960
temperature fluctuations why is cat's

621
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,679
claw in there that that's an interesting

622
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
thing right there cat's claw one dropper

623
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
full

624
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,840

that in there with the ashwagandha

627
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,440
do you know why cat's claw is in there

628
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,840
because a lot of people's hot flashes

629
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:41,120
is viral pathogen byproduct which means

630
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:44,080
pathogens are living inside their liver

631
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,240
cat's claw is going in there to knock

632
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,360
out pathogens

633
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,120
all right let's keep moving along

634
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,559

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
one dropper full two dropper fulls

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,159
don't have hot flashes

640
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
then maybe you have autoimmune maybe you

641
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,880
have fibro maybe have lupus maybe you

642
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,799
have something else that's the

643
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,120
autoimmune section there right maybe you

644
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,960
got ms maybe got neurological lyme maybe

645
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,559
you got tinnitus vertigo we've got

646
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
eczema psoriasis

647
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,120
maybe got something else and the

648
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,360
protocols are in here

649
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,240
i don't know what i can do

650
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,880
i can work i could work i could talk the

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,880
spirit of compassion i could break all

652
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
the rules in the in the health world in

653
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,400
the sense where we got more people

654
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,559
healed than ever before in chronic

655
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
illness history which breaks all the

656
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
rules

657
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
because you're not supposed to get

658
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
millions of people better but yet

659
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,440
medical medium information did that it

660
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
can do all this

661
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,640
but i can't i can't do any more than

662
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
that you have to sometimes say you know

663
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,559
what i think i'm gonna go to the library

664
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
i'm gonna get the book out for free

665
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,520
and i'm going to work on it i'm going to

666
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,600
work on it

667
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
or whatever get the book amazon or

668
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,960
something so there's the lemon bump

669
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,840
licorice fruit why licorice fruit

670
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
okay

671
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,679
licorice fruit's a big one for those hot

672
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,159
flashes what does it say for licorice

673
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,000
fruit one dropper full

674
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,919
i just put the one dropper full in okay

675
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
right and then it has a couple more

676
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,880
things it's got the chaga mushroom in

677
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,799
here it's got the curcumin right there's

678
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,679
the curcumin

679
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,760
so

680
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,080
that's what's incredible about this i

681
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,679
see vitamin b12 so then there's the

682
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,880
vitamin b12 it says one dropper full

683
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
daily

684
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,559
with the hot flashes just showing you

685
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,600
guys how this works

686
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,679
right and then zinc

687
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
best thing there is on the market i know

688
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,600
people ever since medical medium got the

689
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,840
word out on the zinc

690
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
because no one used ink it was very

691
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,679
rarely used anywhere

692
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,080
um store shelves would have some old

693
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,039
zincs on there like like in whole foods

694
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,360
it would sit there for two years

695
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,039
i've heard from people that literally in

696
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,799
health food stores where they have they

697
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,320
years ago they've had to throw away the

698
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,559
zinc off the shelves because it always

699
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,919
went out of date nobody used zinc

700
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,279
and then what happened is medical medium

701
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880
information taught everybody about the

702
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,360
viruses and talked to everybody about

703
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,440
how to use zinc and it exploded it now

704
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,120
every single person's coming out their

705
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
own zinc and it's got junk in it and

706
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,880
garbage in it that's the zinc that's

707
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,559
important so one dropper full of zinc in

708
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
there i'm gonna add a little water to

709
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,320
this protocol

710
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,320
okay

711
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,640
and

712
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,039
that right there

713
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,840
is an example

714
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,840
of protocol use right there

715
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,880
and it tastes pretty darn good

716
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,640
doesn't taste that bad at all

717
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,840
all right let's move on so that was

718
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
something you guys let's go to

719
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,440
neurological issues

720
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
let's see here we are neurological

721
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,559

all right

730
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,520

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,320
anything

784
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,039
we don't like to pre-record anything we

785
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,960
want it live live live

786
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,240

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,919
and people wonder how does he do it

790
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,120
because the podcast doctors won't do it

791
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,480
no one else will do it they all

792
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,080
pre-record everything and edit

793
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,600
everything because they say the wrong

794
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,559
thing every other second they don't know

795
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840

839
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,960

847
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,919
if physical injury has not occurred

848
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,440
neurological symptoms are caused by the

849
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,600
viral explosion of the 20th century that

850
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,440
means that the viruses that we've been

851
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
passed down from our family lines that

852
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
we also contract that we pick up in

853
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,360
restaurants that we pick up wherever we

854
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,480
are we pick up in public bathrooms we

855
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,559
pass along to others sexual transmission

856
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
or intimate transmission or however we

857
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,320
want to deal with the viral explosion

858
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,440
that's happening today the simplexes the

859
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,279
shingles the ebv's the hhv-6 the

860
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,080
cytomegalovirus that's what we're

861
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,559
talking about there okay that's part of

862
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,440
the whole neurological symptom problem

863
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,159
people don't realize their mononucleosis

864
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,200
their mononucleosis is now their

865
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,760
neurological symptoms now years later

866
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,399
their mono that they had

867
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,000
camped out inside their liver

868
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,559
sat in there

869
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,200
and then left the liver went to the

870
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,799
thyroid and the reproductive system

871
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,880
causing endometriosis and pcos in women

872
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,679
with that went to the thyroid

873
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
right

874
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
started causing the hypothyroidism the

875
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,600
hyperthyroidism the cysts and the

876
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,399
nodules on the thyroid people don't know

877
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,679
this the epstein bar and then the

878
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,960
epstein bar leaves the thyroid

879
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,080
it does leaves the thyroid and creates

880
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,760
the neurological symptoms every body's

881
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,159
dealing with and they get the fibro

882
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,080
diagnosis the ra diagnosis they get the

883
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
lupus diagnosis they get all the

884
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,200
different diagnoses the neurological

885
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,399
lyme over time or just have these

886
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,320
symptoms

887
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,720
that's the epstein bar

888
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,799
so what do we do we want to kill off the

889
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,559
epstein bar so i'm in the book right

890
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
here so basically what it is is i got

891
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,360
neurological symptoms that are

892
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,799
unexplained it's not from physical

893
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
injury the doctor checks out

894
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,760
everything's okay

895
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
right

896
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,440
whether they give you a autoimmune

897
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,440
diagnosis or not so what do i do so i'm

898
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120

doing this there's they still have it so

984
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,359
priced so low

985
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,160
for this book all right

986
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,599
two dropper fulls twice a day of cat's

987
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,079
claw

988
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,720
two dropper fulls give you a little bit

989
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,720
of run down what's a dropper full

990
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,000
a dropper folds whatever goes into the

991
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
dropper

992
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,280
that's it that's a dropper full it's

993
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,040
whatever goes into the dropper

994
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,880
really important to know

995
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,880
okay

996
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,560
a half dropper full would be whatever

997
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,920
that half of whatever you just came in

998
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,560
there so that would be a half dropper

999
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,560
hole right there

1000
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,119
that's an example so i just did two

1001
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,119
dropper holes of cat's claw right it

1002
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,440
says curcumin that's on the list what

1003
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,119
does it say about curcumin two capsules

1004
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400
twice a day because what curcumin is and

1005
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,400
this is a high quality one so what

1006
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
curcumin does is it has

1007
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,000
anti-inflammatory properties it doesn't

1008
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,599
mean it kills viruses

1009
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,200
but it acts as aspirin

1010
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,880
curcumin

1011
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,359
acts like aspirin quality matters too

1012
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,040
it's critical right it's to help bring

1013
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,680
down a little bit of that viral

1014
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,880
inflammation that's why that's in there

1015
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,720
what else is in there right d-mannose

1016
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,280
so d-manos

1017
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,200
one tablespoon

1018
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,599
actually i mean that was in the wrong

1019
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,119
one right there sorry there's no d manos

1020
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,200
in this one

1021
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
all right we're in the right one now

1022
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,920
okay

1023
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,680
so yeah you got the cat squad we got

1024
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,880
that in there we got the curcumin that's

1025
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,640
in there too now we're going into

1026
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,480
goldenseal

1027
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
team i was an overactive bladder by the

1028
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,280
way for a second

1029
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,359
which is really an important one so i

1030
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,000
want to go to oracle that's why we're

1031
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,720
live that's why we do this live

1032
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,040
in hopes that happens

1033
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,880
the fun stuff happens right so for

1034
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,200
interstitial cystitis that's what the

1035
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,200
the demanos powder was but we'll talk

1036
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,119
about that in a minute so golden seal

1037
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
let's hit the golden seal one drop or a

1038
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,320
full

1039
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,720
twice a day

1040
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,839
put the dropper full in here

1041
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,880
that's the

1042
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,480
vimergy golden seal right there

1043
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
okay

1044
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,200
so we got that in there next one lemon

1045
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,599
balm lemon balm is antiviral but what i

1046
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,720
love about lemon balm is it calms the

1047
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,280
nerves

1048
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,280
so the lemon balm would be

1049
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,240
four dropper fulls

1050
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,280
four dropper fulls of the lemon balm for

1051
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,040
neurological problems so i just did four

1052
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,839
dropper folds right there now if you're

1053
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,760
sensitive you can take a drop if you're

1054
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,800
sensitive you can take a drop look at

1055
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,920
this ready

1056
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,119
one drop

1057
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,200
two drops

1058
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,119
three drops if you're sensitive look at

1059
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
that four drops

1060
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,480
okay

1061
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,720
i'm gonna give you guys a quick run down

1062
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,560
i watched it for decades

1063
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,680
no one healed no one healed from

1064
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
whatever they were diagnosed with

1065
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,880
candida whatever it was they had

1066
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
neurological problems didn't even know

1067
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,720
it was that they just stayed sick for

1068
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,280
decades i watched it out there when i

1069
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,520
was young and people came up with with

1070
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,040
glorious ideas you can try to eat this

1071
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
you can try to do this

1072
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,280
but people stayed sick

1073
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,839
the way you heal is you really know the

1074
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,599
details of intricate protocols that

1075
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,839
actually work and have a history of

1076
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,599
working and getting people's lives back

1077
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,480
that's how you heal

1078
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,400
intricate critical protocols that get

1079
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,079
people's lives back that have a history

1080
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,160
and a street cred

1081
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
that have already healed people around

1082
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,720
the world that's how people really heal

1083
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
because i've watched it for years people

1084
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,000
go into this place in this clinic and

1085
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,359
then they go here and then they go there

1086
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,920
and then they're trying this and trying

1087
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,800
that and they just stay sick

1088
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,680
it's so sad when i think about it

1089
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,119
it's so sad so we just put that in there

1090
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,599
let's see there's a few other things

1091
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,640
there's b12 there's vitamin c vitamin c

1092
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,119
is five capsules twice a day

1093
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,560
five capsules twice a day

1094
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,800
so

1095
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,960

1096
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,560

1097
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for decades when he's 31 years old

1098
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,560
i wish i was 31 years old that would be

1099
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,240
really awesome

1100
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,320

1103
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,160
me back to when i was 31

1104
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,680

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,000
privately like privately in my head

1118
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,680
privately in my family i don't even call

1119
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,280
them supplements because they're above

1120
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,200
supplements that's what i've learned

1121
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,400
supplements even though i use the term

1122
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,800
supplements and everything because

1123
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,079
that's the technical uh term

1124
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,680
but but

1125
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,680
when you see people heal when they do

1126
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,440
protocols using high quality stuff like

1127
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,280
this it's like beyond it's like above

1128
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,440
that it's it's it's a whole different

1129
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,119
thing happens when you do zinc shock

1137
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,599
thing anyway you guys i'm just using

1138
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
some of the stuff in here you can just

1139
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,000
do

1140
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
i tell people all the time you when you

1141
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,040
read this section in the book about

1142
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,480
protocols you can just do three

1143
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,359
supplements

1144
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,319
three

1145
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,240
you start there you start with two

1146
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,040
two supplements you start with three

1147
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,760
supplements you start with four

1148
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,720
and i talk about the top four

1149
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,040
the top three the details are in here

1150
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,040
don't get overwhelmed don't whatever you

1151
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,119
do if you don't even want to start in

1152
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,319
the supplement protocol section you

1153
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,640

right maybe the mono cleanse

1156
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,160
maybe something like that you don't have

1157
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,480
to get overwhelmed

1158
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,079
the whole point is

1159
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,400
something happens when you have the

1160
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,280
knowledge in your hands even if you

1161
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,119

flash part maybe you did but you're

1212
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,920
wondering where should you start right

1213
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,359
ringing the ears say you're something

1214
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,200

1215
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,920
inflammation of

1216
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,079
the labyrinth of the inner ear okay

1217
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,359
and it gets inflamed by epstein-barr

1218
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,720
creates um tinnitus get popping

1219
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,240
fluttering

1220
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,560
buzzing

1221
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,760
noises in here right whatever's going on

1222
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,680
or you get the ringing and that ringing

1223
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,640
people don't realize it when a fan is on

1224
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,400
the ring could actually change and make

1225
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,319
when different noises are happening the

1226
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,839
rain can get louder at night instead in

1227
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,280
the morning in the morning it's lower

1228
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,920
for a lot of people it gets louder at

1229
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,400
night this is viral nerve inflammation

1230
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,400
inside the ear i talk about it tinnitus

1231
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,720
is in here now which one looms the most

1232
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,440
that's the one you can start with if you

1233
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,160
like and what you'll notice

1234
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,880
when you work on the symptom

1235
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,119
that looms the most

1236
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,560
other symptoms start getting better and

1237
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,800
you're like what the heck is going on

1238
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,800
here why is everything starting to get

1239
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,880
better because guess what

1240
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,040
that epstein barr you had or that

1241
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,520
whatever that you have it's causing

1242
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,119
other problems that streptococcus you

1243
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,680

was brought to you by pictures

1267
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,240
and then all of a sudden the radio went

1268
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,040
on and some music went on you know the

1269
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,599
music went on and i'm like

1270
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,960
dear lord does anybody even stand a

1271
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,760
chance

1272
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,000
anyway oab i got it right here all right

1273
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,720
chronic inflammation of the bladder is

1274
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,920
due to a low-grade infection either

1275
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,160
years past or years present

1276
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,040
maybe not years present but present

1277
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,800
right interstitial cystitis right

1278
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,319
oab overactive bladder utis yeast

1279
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,640
infections bv bacterial vaginosis like

1280
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,880
all this stuff gets all tied in to

1281
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,359
overactive bladder by the way

1282
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,240
okay so

1283
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,040
one or more of the over 50 groups of

1284
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,839
streptococcus bacteria

1285
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,560
or even epstein-barr can fall into the

1286
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,720
category of oab because epstein-barr has

1287
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,040
so many toxins coming out of the liver

1288
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,079
that it gets into the kidneys eventually

1289
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,599
causing the the uh the pudendum nerve

1290
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,800
and other nerves around the bladder to

1291
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,359
get inflamed and then you have

1292
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
overactive bladder that's how it works

1293
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,960
right

1294
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,680
normally both a virus and bacteria are

1295
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,200
present in combination you guys

1296
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,599
working with each other in the same

1297
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,280
environment neurotoxins that the viruses

1298
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,040
release can irritate the lining of the

1299
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,760
bladder like i just told you

1300
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,160
while bacteria nestles themselves deep

1301
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,040
in the bladder lining deep in the

1302
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,560
bladder lining both causing inflammation

1303
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,079
at once

1304
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,079
i don't think i have a bladder prop

1305
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,400
i don't think i have a bladder oh yeah i

1306
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,560
do have a bladder prop i had to remove

1307
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,119
the bladder prop because

1308
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:05,680
because someone complained on tick tock

1309
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,160
that this was like

1310
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,480
sexual contact content or something or

1311
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,440
whatever on take the like the just

1317
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,680

right

1322
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,839
two inches

1323
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,359
i cut it right there before i don't want

1324
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,079
it dripping on the book i cut it on

1327
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,079
barley grass juice powder one teaspoon

1328
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,599
that's the vimergy barley grass cheese

1329
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,119
powder i'm not sponsored if you guys

1330
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,559
just came on here

1331
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,800
right you're watching cat's claw

1332
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,880
right two dropper fulls twice a day

1333
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,000
curcumin two capsules twice a day d

1334
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,359
manos powder one tablespoon three times

1335
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,559
a day

1336
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,880
gaba isn't that interesting spirit of

1337
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,640
compassion wanted gaba

1338
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,319
for oab

1339
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,720
right gaba

1340
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,119
and i can't tell you how many times

1341
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,280
i've used that information family

1342
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,520
friends people throughout the years when

1343
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,359
you use gaba for oab

1344
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,960
something changes because a lot of

1345
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,680
people's oab over active bladder is

1346
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,640
neurological

1347
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,280
nerves they feel like they have to pee a

1348
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,440
hundred times because nerves are

1349
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,359
sensitized

1350
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,160
and gaba helps with sensitized nerves

1351
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,319
you can't find this information anywhere

1352
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,160
you can't medical medium information

1353
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,839
isn't common sense

1354
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,520
it's above common sense because common

1355
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,520
sense is actually just sense that

1356
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,359
everybody just naturally knows right

1357
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,319
you're raised like don't cross the

1358
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,280
street while the traffic is is really

1359
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,960
bad

1360
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,119
like when you're a baby when you're a

1361
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,559
child and you're holding on to mom's

1362
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,480
mommy's hand

1363
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,119
it's like don't cross the street yet you

1364
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,319
see the cars coming that's called common

1365
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,119
sense

1366
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,640
right everybody has common sense medical

1367
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,880
medium information just makes sense

1368
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,160
it makes sense when nothing else makes

1369
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,599
sense out there that's the difference

1370
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,680
between between medical medium

1371
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,800
information it's not common sense common

1372
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,760
sense is like

1373
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,760
don't

1374
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,040
jump off the cliff

1375
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,839
onto those raging rocks and water down

1376
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,680
there and and you know and waves

1377
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:37,040
you're gonna die if you do that that's

1378
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,240
common sense right you don't do a selfie

1379
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,400
while hanging on a tower

1380
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,599
don't do a selfie while hanging off a

1381
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,559
building you know hey guys wait hey wait

1382
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,119
i'm holding on here no wait wait guys no

1383
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,119
wait i'm doing a selfie yeah

1384
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,440
common sense is that

1385
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,960
right medical medium information makes

1386
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,400
sense

1387
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,559
and that's the whole point right it's

1388
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,800
above the common sense line you won't

1389
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,240
find information about how

1390
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,079
to

1391
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,079
heal oab by using gaba because medical

1392
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,359
research and science doesn't know that

1393
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,240
your

1394
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,800
overactive bladder could be neurological

1395
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,640
which is your pudendum nerves but more

1396
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,240
than that all the nerves going around in

1397
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,680
and out of the bladder and what you're

1398
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,680
what you're feeling what the reason why

1399
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,800
you have to pee every second is you're

1400
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,280
actually you're feeling sensitized

1401
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,040
nerves you can't find that anywhere and

1402
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,480
that's why people heal around the world

1403
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,559
it's incredible

1404
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,280
so we got the the protocol in here it's

1405
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,280
magnesium glycinate is in that protocol

1406
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,119
so that's the vimergy magnesium

1407
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,359
glycinate right there if you guys just

1408
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
came on here two things someday you

1409
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,839
might want to get in your life

1410
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,800
one is the cleanse the heel book another

1411
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:53,040
is high quality subs this is vimergy you

1412
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,440
find this stuff at vimrgy.com whatever

1413
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,079
and high quality subs and learn

1414
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,240
protocols to move yourself forward right

1415
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,920
but either way if you have the book

1416
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,280
that's an incredible start because you

1417
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,200
can start with the cleanses you can

1418
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,680
start with the knowledge there the

1419
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,000
information so i'm an overactive bladder

1420
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,920
so magnesium glycinate so here we are

1421
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,240
melatonin

1422
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,680
is in overactive bladder

1423
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,440
interesting

1424
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,280
i'll tell you why

1425
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,280
because you get ocd

1426
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,400
with overactive bladder if you're

1427
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,319
somebody

1428
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,079
that has the ocd overactive bladder i

1429
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,319
peed

1430
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,920
but i know i'm gonna have to pee again

1431
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,680
in five minutes

1432
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
i can't go to bed yet i'm just starting

1433
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,720
to fall asleep

1434
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,079
and i have to pee again i'm just

1435
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,079
starting to fall asleep and i have to

1436
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,640
pee again wait i'm falling asleep but i

1437
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:48,160
have to pee again i just peed five more

1438
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,680
times it's now 11 45 at night and i'm i

1439
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,280
think i can just i think i'm good i

1440
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,960
don't have to pee again

1441
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,960
and then you have to pee again and now

1442
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:59,040
you're off doing that right there okay

1443
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,280
the melatonin is helpful for that

1444
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,200
helpful for the brain to try to break

1445
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,640
the ocd aspect of overactive bladder

1446
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,920
look if i didn't cover your illness

1447
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,000
today i didn't cover you know if i

1448
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,520
didn't cover ms if it didn't cover fibro

1449
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,720
ra or whatever that's going on or your

1450
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,880
autoimmune or constipation or or cysts

1451
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,480
protocol in here or multiple sclerosis

1452
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,559
or like i said autoimmune

1453
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,920
if i didn't they're all it's all in here

1454
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,599
i'm just covering some of them if you're

1455
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,359
somebody with overactive bladder great

1456
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,960
if you don't have overactive bladder

1457
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,960
fine i mean i'm in here right now and i

1458
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,640
just see pandas right here just right

1459
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,079
here it's pandas

1460
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,520
yeah people are like what this medical

1461
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,440
medium doesn't know anything about

1462
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,400
pandas just our pandas community does

1463
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,079
really

1464
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,280
and then you know you go into the pandas

1465
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,800
community and you look and it's like

1466
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,040
everybody's clueless

1467
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,280
and you feel so bad you feel bad for the

1468
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,359
moms you feel bad for the kids you feel

1469
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,960
bad for them all because they don't even

1470
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,720
know what to do

1471
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,559
and and it's so sad and here's the

1472
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,040
pandas section right here

1473
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,960
no you know this is it right here it's

1474
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,319
it's streptococcus infection right

1475
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,280
associated that's the whole thing where

1476
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,800
they say it's associated with

1477
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,119
streptococcus infection true cause

1478
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,960
a co-infection of one or more strains

1479
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,920
from over 50 groups of streptococcus

1480
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,640
bacteria plus a virus most commonly

1481
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,119
hhv-6 you know why kids don't heal with

1482
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,119
pandas it's rare they can do unless they

1483
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,559
use like certain protocol like pieces

1484
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,200
that they've gotten from medical medium

1485
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,400
in the last 35 years the reason why kids

1486
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,040
don't heal

1487
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,359
well at all from pandas is because they

1488
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,839
just think it's strep and then their

1489
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:35,559
strep protocols aren't even correct

1490
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:35,559
that's why because pandas is hhv-6

1491
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,119
co-infection

1492
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,400
is strep to coctus see the difference

1493
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,920
right there

1494
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,079
so

1495
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,880
the co-infection

1496
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,359
even epstein-barr in hhv6 right and

1497
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,480
that's medical medium information okay

1498
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,599
and then toxic heavy metals is the other

1499
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,440
aspect of pandas that's how you heal

1500
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,000
pandas you get the metals out you get

1501
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,760
the co-infections down

1502
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,960
right does it have anything to do with

1503
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,680
mycotoxin poisoning that's a trigger so

1504
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,920
so so so mycotoxins that's that's an

1505
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,880
actual trigger so any kind of mold any

1506
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,280
kind of mold exposure that's an actual

1507
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,000
trigger to lower the immune system and

1508
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,640
then the real infectious problems about

1509
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,720
pandas are the real problems that creep

1510
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,680
up

1511
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,280
look

1512
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,880
maybe right now this isn't important to

1513
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,240
a lot of people and they're just like oh

1514
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,160
just go

1515
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,119
look for some other info or whatever but

1516
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,960
you know when i'm gone down the road

1517
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,119
and and it's gonna be a bigger sea of

1518
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,480
confusion than anyone's ever seen before

1519
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,599
in history because i've been told this

1520
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,520
over and over again by spirit of

1521
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,400
compassion and it's the biggest sea of

1522
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,400
confusion ever

1523
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,079
someone's going to have this book

1524
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,359
and they're going to be able to save

1525
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,200
their life

1526
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,200
