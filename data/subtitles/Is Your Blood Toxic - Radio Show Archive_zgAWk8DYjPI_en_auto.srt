talk is on is your blood toxic is your

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,440
blood toxic this is really an important

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,519
show all the way around from for so many

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,520
reasons and advanced information is how

you get people better that's how they

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,560
get better it's how I've gotten people

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,759
better for decades and decades and

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,360
decades and and it matters that much to

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,479
have even the smallest piece of

31
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,040
information that's never been out there

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
before which is straight celery juice

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,200
that's an example because that's

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,840
actually good for your blood good for

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
getting your blood not to be toxic

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,240
that's why I'm even bringing it up right

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,720
now but it's a prime example how one one

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
little gem one little gem can be that

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,240
lifechanging can you imagine all the

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,920
other gems that are in Liver Rescue can

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,640
you imagine all the other gems that are

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,200
in the other medical medium series books

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,840
that Spirit has delivered and that's the

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,680
whole point so everyone starts to turn

45
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,399
their life around and it matters you're

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
worth it you're absolutely worth it

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
you're worth doing the things you need

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,520
to do you're worth seeking out the right

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,240
information you're worth staying away

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,479
from misinformation you're worth it all

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,360
and you're worth staying away from the

52
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,240
trend

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,960
someone said to me hey the celery juice

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,719
it's a trend now no actually the celery

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,440
juice is the PowerHouse and then the

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,479
trend is trying to destroy it now

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,959
they're trying to destroy it they're

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,800
saying oh wait a minute you shouldn't do

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
all straight celery juice Oh that's oh

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,280
wait a minute you should do this put

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,280
this put pre P protein in with it do

62
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,080
this the trend is out there to try to

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,959
actually break it down and ruin it

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,840
actually that's what trends do so no

65
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,640
it's not a trend it's a truth celery

66
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,760
juice is a truth and I'm talking about

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
it a little bit because we're talking

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
about toxic blood what are we talking

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,000
about talking about dark circles under

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
the eyes varicose veins we're talking

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
about reenal syndrome you know the

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
discoloration and all the symptoms when

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
you get the the purple blotches and

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,920
you're you're you're feel like the

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
circulation isn't there and your

76
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,680
extremities and everything else we're

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,800
going to talk about that a little bit um

78
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,120
I mean list goes on we can talk about a

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
lot of things gout we can talk about

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,720
everything that has something to do with

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,360
dirty blood and you think that those

82
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,239
don't apply to you you think that gout

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,200
or Renault syndrome or anything else

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
doesn't apply to you you're wrong

85
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,519
because it's more than that toxic blood

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,400
causes problems everywhere it causes

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
every problem you can possibly imagine

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,360
when your blood's toxic with certain

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
things in it you get the brain fog when

90
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,879
your blood's toxic with certain stuff in

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,400
it you get all kinds of symptoms you get

92
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,120
the fatigue you get everything that

93
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,799
that's the whole point is your blood

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,319
toxic and we're going to go deep into

95
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,560
this deep into this indeed because it

96
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,159
needs to be done you know I can't I

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,959
can't just sit around and wait and wait

98
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,720
and wait hoping that chronic illness is

99
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,239
going to slow down out there it's not

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
unless the information gets in your

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,319
hands unless you become the expert I

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
want you to become the expert I really

103
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,360
do so here's the deal here's a deal is

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,560
your blood toxic how does this work

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,799
first of all I'm going to start off

106
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,159
right here right now with this there are

107
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,080
so many things in our blood so many

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,959
different toxins in our blood that

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
science and research in the medical

110
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,040
industry can't even do an analysis on

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
they can't even analyze it blood Labs

112
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,720
don't even have the ability to see

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,840
what's inside our blood they don't it's

114
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,519
limited it's absolutely limited they

115
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,920
can't see the petrochemicals inside your

116
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,120
blood can they can they see the

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,000
petrochemicals that are inside your

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
blood you tell me can they see all the

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,439
solvents that are inside your blood you

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
you tell me can they all those

121
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,680
detergents and spray cleaners and

122
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,160
everything else that have all these

123
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,600
petrochemicals and solvents can they see

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,199
all that in your bloodstream when they

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
draw blood do you hear that come back

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,919
from the doctor's office no no of course

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
not do they see any viral material in

128
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,400
the in the blood no they don't see

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,039
byproduct in the blood they never do

130
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,600
they never see byproduct they never see

131
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,240
viral stuff they never see all that

132
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,120
discharge from all the bugs they never

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,039
see all that either in the blood do they

134
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,199
see heavy metals in the blood

135
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,800
no no now unless you literally unless

136
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,120
honestly you stepped into a mine of lead

137
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
a Lead Mine somewhere you know what I

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
mean and you were bathing in lead water

139
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
and they could be like yeah you got lead

140
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,759
poisoning they do blood they could

141
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,360
actually they could find the lead sure

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
that's different but I'm talking about

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,360
traces that that torment people's lives

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
on a daily basis that are just floating

145
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,800
around the bloodstream you go to the

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,240
doctor doctor's office you come back you

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,639
can't they can't see all this stuff it's

148
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,000
not possible and what about other things

149
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,240
too what about all the other things too

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,960

Invasion the domestic Invasion that's

152
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,120
means household products that we're

153
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,919
using every day um plug-in fresheners

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,400
we're using plug-in fresheners we're

155
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,120

it just just magically disappears do you

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
think we don't need to take care of our

164
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,120
blood and our liver do you think we

165
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,759
don't need to take I mean seriously what

166
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,560
about going to the gasoline station go

167
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,400
in gasoline station gra just pump your

168
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,759
own gas oh fumees coming out breathe it

169
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,080
right in oh that doesn't go into our

170
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,400
bloodstream no that's not going to sit

171
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
there for a whole day or two or three

172
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,360
days just floating around in our

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,039
bloodstream no and science of research

174
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,600
can't can't can't showcase that I me

175
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,240
they can't pull blood out and say were

176
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,919
you at the gas pump the other day

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,479
inhaling somebody's gas fumes that was

178
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,720
spewing out of their car and and the

179
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,039
wind was taking it right to you and

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,199
you're breathing in straight gasoline

181
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
where you know with all those

182
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,919
petrochemicals going in there going

183
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,759
right into your lungs right into your

184
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,080

that could be in the bloodstream that's

203
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,800
not even the natural toxins that the

204
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,759
body produces see the body is under such

205
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,479
a load it's unbelievable every single

206
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,240
day it's under such a load it's under

207
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:02,080
adrenaline adrenaline is so darn toxic

208
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,800

just just something that gets you high

213
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,879
something that's gets you high and it

214
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
seems like it's a good thing like

215
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,840
anything like hey I'm going to go skiing

216
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and whoa I'm going down a more of a

217
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,160
dangerous slope who I never took that

218
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,120
way before and wow my adrenaline's

219
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,639

224
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
do that because you still there were

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,440
still things that you got out of that

226
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,599
was that was really amazing but the

227
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,120
point is is that the blood gets toxic

228
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,639
that's why we don't live forever that's

229
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,199
a whole another reason why we don't live

230
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,240

231
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,080

misinformation oil oh you got to be on

306
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,320
your fish oil the whole bit yeah it's

307
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,200
methyl mercury in the fish oil doesn't

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,880
matter what company makes it that's

309
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,000
different than eating a piece of fish

310
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,360
you get more Mercury from a Mercury free

311
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,240
fish oil capsule so-called Mercury free

312
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,200
fish oil capsule you'll get more Mercury

313
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,360
from that than a can a tuna because it's

314
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,720
it's basically homeopathic I talk about

315
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,240
in the books too it's homeopathic what

316
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,160
it is is when they extract when they

317
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,160
pull Mercury out of something it gets

318
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
stronger believe it or not and sure if

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,399
Mercury's in it it it's also strong too

320
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
but when you keep on pulling it out when

321
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,160
you centrifuge it out and you give out

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,279
fish oil it's actually has the memory of

323
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,399
mercury which is which causes more

324
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,279
effects more effects on the health can

325
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,360
you can possibly imagine and so what

326
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,959
happens is because it's so so hyper when

327
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,240
you pull it out and pull it out it

328
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,760
becomes hyper it's a homeopathic option

329
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,480
it's really bad so what it is

330
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,200
everybody's on the fish oil it's highly

331
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,120
inflammatory fish oil they're all on the

332
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,839
fish oil

333
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,720

people say well yeah my my uh my

364
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,320
grandfather died at 80 he well he would

365
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,920
have died at

366
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
95 if he did this and this and this and

367
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,519
this and

368
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,959
this that's right oh you know this

369
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,199
person died at 70 it would have died at

370
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,320
80 do you want 10 it's 10 more years

371
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:53,440
even worth having it is worth having 10

372
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,120
more years is worth having 10 more years

373
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,279
there's people that die at 50 they could

374
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,600
have could have made it to 75 they were

375
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,320
doing just some of the right things in

376
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
their life life with their health as

377
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,040
people who die at 90 they could have

378
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,199
lived to be 115 120 you know it's

379
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,240
amazing how it works the point is does

380
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,760
it even matter yes it does it matters

381
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,320
cuz it's not just about how long you can

382
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,480
live regardless it's the quality of your

383
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,959
life no matter what it's the quality of

384
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
your life during when you're living and

385
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,000
the whole bit and that matters and so

386
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,320
many people and I understand you'll lose

387
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,760
the quality of your life because our

388
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,000
blood is toxic cuz we don't know what's

389
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,279
going on we got all these different

390
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,079
things going on back to Apple CID of

391
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,519
vinegar cuz I probably angered a whole

392
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,160
bunch of you guys like crazy I know it I

393
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,399
know it like bees like bees I get it

394
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,480
because you're into the apple cider

395
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,560
vinegar I totally get it but it pickles

396
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,920
the liver you don't know what your liver

397
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,519
likes it's unbelievable what we like and

398
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,600
what we put in our mouth has nothing to

399
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,040
do what what with what the liver likes

400
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
and that's another thing too in Liver

401
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,480
Rescue I talk about that I have a

402
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,040
cleanse in there a cleanse that you

403
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,560
don't have to spend $5,000 to do okay I

404
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,160
got a cleanse a simple cleanse in there

405
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,480
to protect your liver you can do the

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,120
cleanse periodically and bring your

407
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,680
liver back and get your blood to to not

408
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,680
be toxic that's what we need to do and

409
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,240
that's the power of healing because it's

410
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,079
not about having to go and and do this

411
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,600
massive you know oh my God I got to do

412
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,800
this I got to do that and got to do this

413
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
it's not about that it's about just

414
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,320
doing a few of the right things and it

415
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,560
matters it really does so with apple

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,079
cider vinegar what it does is it pickles

417
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,880
the liver there's sodium in our blood

418
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,279
there's sodium inside our blood okay and

419
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,680
naturally inside our blood our liver

420
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:34,800
harb a larger amount of sodium because

421
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,320
our liver is the filter the filter for

422
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,199
poor sodium bad sodium that we get in

423
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,279
our life all through our life you don't

424
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,920
think you you think the salt that you

425
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,320
ate on that hot dog or whatever it was

426
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,120
in that hot dog 5 years ago you don't

427
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,279
think the salt still traces of it aren't

428
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,680
still in you somewhere you don't think

429
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,320
the salt that you've eaten all these

430
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,560
years and all those treats and all that

431
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
garbage and everything else and I'm not

432
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,240
blaming you for that I get it I mean

433
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,399
what everybody I I get when why we eat

434
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,639
the way we eat and that's not about what

435
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,959
the show is about we can do a

436
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,759
compassionate show about why we end up

437
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,639
eating like we're eating how we're not

438
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,880
educated how it's emotional to I I

439
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,240
understand all that I talk about that in

440
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,279
Liver Rescue in the book Liver Rescue I

441
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,000
talk about that in there but I'm talking

442
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:24,320
about you don't think that sodium that

443
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,240
sodium that road salt isn't in your body

444
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
it is it's stored in the liver it's

445
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,319
stored in the liver to protect you it's

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,079
sitting inside the liver the liver

447
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,720
actually stores it and then tries to get

448
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,600
rid of it and discard it over the years

449
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,240
we've compiled so much salt on our in

450
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,639
our bodies to and it makes our blood

451
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,360
toxic cuz it's not the right kind of

452
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,079
sodium like celery juice which makes

453
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,399
your blood not toxic it cleans your

454
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,759
blood celery juice cleans your blood

455
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,319
straight celery juice so what happens is

456
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,040
it it actually

457
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,440
dismembers dismembers if that's a if

458
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,319
that's an okay word to use it it

459
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,560
completely dissolves and breaks down and

460
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,839
dismembers other salts that have been

461
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,360
that won't leave the organs we get

462
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:11,360
salted throughout our life this isn't an

463
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,920
anti- salt campaign this isn't a anti

464
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,480
salt show you can do a little Himalayan

465
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,319
sea salt if you really want here and

466
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,079
there for a fun treat you can do a

467
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,199
little bit of Celtic Sea salt or

468
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,880
something if you you're making a recipe

469
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,160
if you really love salt but we've had a

470
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,720
lot more salt than that in our lives

471
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,800
early on early on from the beginning all

472
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,759
the way to now and even though the salt

473
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
might diminish in the bloodstream it get

474
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,199
collects in the organs and it cakes in

475
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,720
the organs it cakes pockets of sodium

476
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,920
pockets of salt end up in the liver and

477
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,360
in other organs and this starts also the

478
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,199
process of really dirty blood dirty

479
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,079
blood in and toxic blood so when you do

480
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,680
vinegars any kind of vinegars whether

481
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,240
whatever kind of vinegars all the other

482
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,240
vinegars are bad they're way bad and

483
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,880
apple cider vinegar is better but you do

484
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
apple cider vinegar and you're doing a

485
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,160
lot of it every day a few tablespoons a

486
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,440
day or you're putting it in your food

487
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,880
every single day or you're told you

488
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,679
should be just drinking it every day or

489
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,319
whatever it is because it's good for

490
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
this good for that you know someone says

491
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,760
oh it fixed my acid reflux can I tell

492
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,319
you how many cases of acid reflux it

493
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,760
caused how about that you there there's

494
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,640
a percentage of people that fix their

495
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,799
acid reflux do you know there's a larger

496
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,120
percentage that it caused acid reflux

497
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
did you know there's a tiny small

498
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,079
percentage of people it helped their

499
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
bloating did you know there's a massive

500
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,079
large percentage that it causes bloating

501
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,600
how about that okay 10 people it gets

502
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,880
their bloating better or they think they

503
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
got their bloating better from the apple

504
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,000
cider vinegar 90 people bloat the hell

505
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,200
up like you can't believe from it it's

506
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,080
unbelievable

507
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,559
unbelievable okay 10 people get to get

508
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,160
their acid reflux a little better by

509
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,240
actually using Apple set of vinegar even

510
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,640
though they changed their diet and did

511
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,760
other things too along with it and then

512
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,360
90 people get the worst acid reflux ever

513
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,440
imaginable from from apple cider vinegar

514
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,039
I've seen it over and over and hear

515
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,200
about it over and over and over again

516
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,039
it's not apple cider vinegar attack it's

517
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
is your blood toxic and I'm talking

518
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,960
about what's going on when you're doing

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,640
the vinegar what it does is it gets it

520
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,320
mixes with the Sodium piles from your

521
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,840
old sodium storage is from Bad salts all

522
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,679
this time it mixes with it in organs

523
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,320
such as the liver and it pickles the

524
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:23,240
liver it literally pickles it and that's

525
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,360
what happens it causes a

526
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,320
pickling literally and you have to

527
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,200
understand what that does it prunes up

528
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,600
the organ it puts it under stress

529
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,919
massive stress makes the organ more

530
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,480
toxic so apple cider vinegar isn't for a

531
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,919
cleanse it's not cleansing you it's

532
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,799
making your blood more toxic is your

533
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,240
blood toxic yes it is Apple CID V will

534
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,640
make your blood more toxic I don't care

535
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,280
if there's pitchforks torches you know

536
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,640
what I mean the whole bit at the house

537
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,919
you know I don't care or at my office

538
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,600
and they're all sitting with pitchforks

539
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,200
now cuz of apple cider vinegar I don't

540
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,840
care and I don't care about the trolls

541
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,039

body's already under a load trying to

592
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,280
process so much we're trying to get

593
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,320
ammonia out our digestive systems don't

594
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,760
work good our livers are broken down the

595
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,400
bile is not strong enough to break down

596
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,039
the fats and disperse the fats okay our

597
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,159
hydrochloric acid is not good enough to

598
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,760
break down proteins everybody's HCL is

599
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,640
down that's why celery juice is so

600
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,360
critical important to get you better

601
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,080
think about that think about that so

602
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
what happens is when food starts rotting

603
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,799
you get gut rot you get get food rot

604
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,600
everybody gets his food rot and they're

605
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,360
dropping proteins in and everything else

606
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,159
and their food's rotting and ammonia is

607
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,559
being produced all that ammonia is in

608
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
the blood causing toxic blood and in the

609
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
end it's going to cause cellulite down

610
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,559
the road if you think you're cellulite

611
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,880

eaten a long time ago and everything

722
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,240
else that you've eaten and whatever I

723
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,559
mean you could just damn it Pizza what

724
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,960
everything it has all that bad salt do

725
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,799
you think that salt just disappeared it

726
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,000
disappeared out of the bloodstream

727
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,799
it did but it stayed compacted in the

728
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,279
organs and then when you do like

729
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,080
vinegars of any kinds you actually

730
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:11,279
pickle organs and you age rapidly you

731
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,360
actually age rapidly and that's what

732
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,919
happens but you can get those toxic

733
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,720
salts out by using celery juice and

734
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,000
things of anything with skin problems

735
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,480
anything like exam psoriasis hives any

736
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,640
kind of thing that happens with the skin

737
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,120
too peeling in the hands peeling in the

738
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,919
feet all kinds of skin issues you can

739
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,240
celery juice literally can help by

740
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,919
actually removing dermat toxins and tox

741
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,640
and viral toxins out of the blood to try

742
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,399
to get you better the blood is filled

743
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,240
with so many things that's not seen by

744
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,960
research and science they can't see

745
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,640
anything in the blood you know what's

746
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,320
really annoying you guys is they will

747
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,440
take so much blood from you do you know

748
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,880
how much blood they throw away you

749
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,480
wouldn't believe it when they pull vials

750
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,200
I run into this all the time the blood

751
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,200
labs are they're literally criminal in

752
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,799
my opinion because they they they demand

753
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,840
so much blood I've seen people get

754
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,320
sicker because they had 15 vials of

755
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,120
blood taken out you know people with

756
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,880
chronic fatigue syndrome what happens is

757
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,520
when you get all that blood removed it

758
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,960
removes your immune system and then how

759
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,520
it doesn't remove the viruses that are

760
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
that are hurting people so you got the

761
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,520
worst CFS M you got chronic fatigue

762
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,520
syndrome you got fibromyalgia whatever

763
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,360
it is you got fatigue you got you you

764
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,760
know aches and pains you're your body's

765
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,559
burning up you got all kinds of

766
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,039
different burning on your body you got

767
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,760
rashes you got whatever it is you're

768
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,720
dealing with you got you can't think you

769
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,240
got the worst brain fog possible you got

770
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
so-called Lyme disease or whatever it is

771
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,720
that's going on or whatever you're

772
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,279
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and

773
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,919
what do they do I'm talking so fast my

774
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,919
voice is getting dry what do they do

775
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,080
they they extract too much blood from

776
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,960
people that are sick I see it happen all

777
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,720
the time what I've always told clients

778
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,679
no no no no no you give them four five

779
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,640
five vials at a time you give them three

780
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,880
vials it's it's their problem they're

781
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,159
Throwing It All Away they throw it all

782
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,279
away they throw it all away they remove

783
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,799
your immune system they literally remove

784
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,880
your immune system you'll never hear

785
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,840
this anywhere that's the whole point

786
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,520
you'll never hear it anywhere else

787
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,240
you'll never hear the truth about things

788
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,279
anywhere else and listen I know a lot of

789
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,000
Physicians and I know a lot of experts I

790
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,039
know a lot of science people I know a

791
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
lot of people in science I know

792
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,039
geneticists I know so many people in the

793
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,159
field of medicine and people say to me

794
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,399
they say like things like it's amazing

795
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,880
what they say to me they'll say how do

796
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,120
you know what how it works how do you

797
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
know which way work you don't know any

798
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,240
doctors or anything are you kidding me

799
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
are are you kidding me I mean just I

800
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,279
mean it's unbelievable and and yeah I do

801
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,640
and the thing is is this is that is that

802
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,919
I know a lot of people in the field that

803
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,760
are even above the regular thing that's

804
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,320
going on so when you go to your doctor I

805
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,880
know people that are that are actually

806
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,080
in the system of the medical field that

807
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,679
tell me and they say you know what

808
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,320
you're 100% right about how the blood

809
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,600
Labs work this is what they do this is

810
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,519
what they do they they take all this

811
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
blood they use a Speck of it and they

812
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,120
literally throw away your blood they

813
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,679
throw away your blood it's unbelievable

814
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,120
and when they screen blood it's it's the

815
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,640
system is so flawed the way they screen

816
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,039
it and how much they waste and what

817
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,320
happens is when they pull it out like

818
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,039
that you get more toxic so when you're

819
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,240
sick they're actually killing you slowly

820
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,039
that's the irony because you get more

821
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,720
toxic and more viral because what they

822
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,279
do is when they pull that much blood out

823
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,360
they're pulling out your immune system

824
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,600
your white count they're just ripping it

825
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,279
out it's in your blood it's hard for

826
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,480
people to produce that when they're sick

827
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,600
when they're that sick and they're that

828
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,200
Viral with lupus Lyme disease multiple

829
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,760
sclerosis Hashimoto fatigue cry fatigue

830
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,960
fibromyalgia scaros all these different

831
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,679
things whatever they're dealing with all

832
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,000
these different illnesses and different

833
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,279
situations and they're going to the

834
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,880
doctor and they're getting all pulled

835
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,200
out of them and then you go to these

836
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,519
functional medicine doctors which I

837
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,799
still love too but you go to these

838
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,240
functional medicine doctors and they're

839
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,840
pulling out 25 vials 20 vials it's all

840
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,559
being thrown away cuz the labs are

841
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,159
throwing it away and then what's

842
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,559
happening your whole blood your all your

843
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,080
white count is being removed and then

844
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,799
and what's happening the viruses aren't

845
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,559
being removed and then there's less

846
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,440
white count to stop your viruses and

847
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,960
people get sicker and sicker and sicker

848
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,200
with Lyme disease and their lime doctors

849
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,799
are pulling all this blood out of them

850
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,559
they're getting sicker and sicker and

851
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,159
sicker that's how it works and then they

852
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,559
get thrown antibiotics in them even

853
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,760
though they get thrown also herbs and

854
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,320
even though they get thrown natural

855
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,120
stuff and diet they also get throwing

856
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,440
antibiotics in them and then that makes

857
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,279
them sicker and sicker and their blood

858
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,120
more toxic I've seen this over and over

859
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,480
again that's just lime I'm talking about

860
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,720
all kinds of different things and so

861
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,760
what happens is when you're sick your

862
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,960
blood can even get more toxic when

863
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,720
you're not sick your blood's still toxic

864
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,159
and science and research doesn't have a

865
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,799
clue as to far as far as what kind of

866
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,240
petrochemicals are floating in the blood

867
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,399
all day long what kind of diesel fumes

868
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,120
you just breathe in when you were on

869
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,640
your bicycle on the road you know like

870
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,320
riding your bicycle and somebody drove

871
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
by and all that petrochemical went

872
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,919
inside your bloodstream and it's sits in

873
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,360
there for 2 weeks and then goes inside

874
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,440
your liver no one talks about that or

875
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,640
how about that when you're in college

876
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,080
and you paint at your dorm room and and

877
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,279
and you Splash pain on yourself and

878
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,799
everything and it's all sitting inside

879
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,799
the liver and it still keeps your blood

880
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
toxic every single day as you're getting

881
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,279
older and you age faster then you get

882
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,640
the hot flashes then you get the viral

883
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,080
issues and the hot flashes and the

884
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,360
weight gain and nobody knows why you're

885
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,440
getting the weight gain and your blood's

886
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,120
toxic they can draw blood they can't see

887
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,880
the toxins it doesn't you know it's

888
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,399
unbelievable that's how flawed the whole

889
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,279
system is and that's how behind we are

890
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:29,159
with health even the most advanced Al

891
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,640
Alternative Health is dogging it's so

892
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,440
bad it's painful when it comes down to

893
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,440
chronic illness but yes science and

894
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,960
research can send some amazing rocket

895
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,760
ships in in their sending rocket ships

896
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,840
in space even though they're antiques

897
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,440
compared to what's coming in the future

898
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,760
but still they can send them into space

899
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,840
they can remove aneurysms out of

900
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,080
people's brains they got robots now I I

901
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,000
know a neurosurgeon that actually uses

902
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,960
he uses a mechanism he controls a

903
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,240
mechanism to carefully carefully pull

904
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,240
out like remove an aneurysm it's it's

905
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,639
unbelievable and that's science and

906
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
research in a good way life-saving

907
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,440
medicine stuff like that sure but in

908
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,480
chronic illness it's absolutely

909
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,799
disastrous and toxic blood not being

910
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,399
recognized like toxic blood not being

911
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,200
recognized dirty blood not being

912
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,320
recognized is one of the big mistakes

913
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,120
and in throwing blood away in all the

914
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,240
patience is another terrible mistake

915
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,799
when will that get fixed probably not in

916
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,279
my lifetime not in my lifetime that's

917
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,039
never going to get fixed but I tell

918
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,880
clients you give them three to five

919
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:30,840
vials the most

920
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,320
at a time you go back and you have them

921
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,559
do different tests then and do another

922
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,159
three vials and let them throw away your

923
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,159
blood carefully let them throw it away

924
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,440
carefully so your white blood count

925
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,679
doesn't diminish to such a degree that

926
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,760
you get more viral and more sick and

927
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,760
your strep comes out and and annihilates

928
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,679
you and your the Epstein bar comes out

929
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,679
and your hhv6 comes out and your simplex

930
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,000
one comes out and starts screwing you up

931
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,519
and getting into your nervous system

932
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,760
causing more problems with your nerves

933
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,360
and so it's important it's really

934
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
important to know that you can protect

935
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,639
yourself because your blood could get

936
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
more toxic when you're sick just from

937
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,639
regular standard medical practices it's

938
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,399
just a little tidbit to try to help you

939
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,399
along with this

940
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,000
so how do we allow toxins that are in

941
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,080
our blood all the different things I

942
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,960
said that are in our blood from you know

943
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,880
cooking on a gas grill from being at a

944
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,760
bombfire one day with all that treat at

945
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,080
wood being burned and going into your

946
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,559
lungs you know all of that all of that

947
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,320
or being you know Somewhere over the

948
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,120
summer and there's just a pile of wood

949
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,360
burning a massive pile of wood burning

950
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,679
and you're you're out there and you're

951
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
just you know you're partying or

952
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,519
something like that and it's just like

953
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,960
you're breathing in so much of this

954
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,440
stuff and and you know what I mean and I

955
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,559
don't like that whole thing ah you can't

956
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,600
live forever hey your immune system has

957
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:51,320
to deal with it you said The more stuff

958
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,080
you throw at yourself the more it builds

959
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,080
you up it makes you stronger it doesn't

960
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,960
work like that that's the biggest croc

961
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,639
that's the biggest pile of of you know

962
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,279
what I've ever heard it doesn't work

963
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:06,760
like that you age faster stuff happens

964
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,360
in your life organs start you know you

965
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,840
start oh wait a minute what my I have

966
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,240
kidney problems you next thing know

967
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,639
you're 38 years old what do you mean

968
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,440
doctor I actually have kidney problems

969
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,840
is that what this is It's I have to go

970
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,720
on dialysis it's like it's like it's

971
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,120
like there's reasons for all of this we

972
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,960
have to keep our blood clean and we have

973
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,880
to protect our livers and get them

974
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,440
clean and so and and clean up our

975
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,200
viruses clean up all the other things

976
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,840
that's inside our body the irony is

977
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,559
people don't even know they're viral

978
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,880
they just have symptoms and they're like

979
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,080
well I don't know I just have I have

980
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
these symptoms they don't even know

981
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,440
they're viral like well I have these I

982
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,440
have this vertigo I had it and I went to

983
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,600
my chiropractor and my chiropractor

984
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,480
didn't know what it was and it's viral

985
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,559
any kind any kind of vertigo is that's

986
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,679
what it is 100% viral and so it's it's

987
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,679
one of these things where you know

988
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,960
people don't even know they're walking

989
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,200
around oh I'm tired I'm fatigued yeah

990
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,159
it's viral and know they don't even know

991
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,600
these things it's amazing how it works

992
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,079
but it's it's important to know what's

993
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,280
going on with you so back to toxic blood

994
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,919
back to the whole thing about how we

995
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,879
don't know how toxic it is our bile

996
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,560
coming out of our liver is filled with

997
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,000
poison filled with poison so if we don't

998
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,599
take care of our livers and clean them

999
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,200
up the bile itself is filled with poison

1000
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,079
and it goes into the Gove ladder and

1001
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,800
that's how stones are produced they're

1002
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,639
produced because of the amount of poison

1003
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,480
that we have that our liers collecting

1004
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,520
all the time someone said to me how does

1005
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,359
a gall stone start it starts with you

1006
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,760
being having toxic blood for many years

1007
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,320
eating the wrong things getting exposure

1008
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,919
to all the wrong things and then the

1009
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,879
liver having to process all this and try

1010
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,119
to get it out in some way and detox it

1011
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,639
out sends it up the bile duct into your

1012
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,480
gallbladder and it forms stones and it

1013
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,399
also goes into your digestive tract all

1014
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,560
the time into your digestive tract the

1015
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,079
poison goes in there all the all the

1016
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,960
different stuff all the different stuff

1017
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,079
and if it's poison if it's poison such

1018
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,400
as like dermatoxin from an Epstein bar

1019
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,440
and having copper in the liver then it

1020
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,920
becomes

1021
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,800
rosacea see that's how it works science

1022
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,040
of research has no idea how what rosacea

1023
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,599
even is they they don't even know what

1024
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,560
causes it what's going on they're just

1025
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,400
right now they're they're in the mode of

1026
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,800
blaming everything on their safe fault

1027
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,320
it's the safe fault is which is bait and

1028
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,920
switch or safe fault whatever you want

1029
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,920
to say it's it's your body attacking

1030
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,320
itself it's your fault and science and

1031
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,320
research is going to figure out ways of

1032
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,160
trying to stop your body from attacking

1033
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,440
itself and we're going to study more

1034
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,599
genes because it must be your genes too

1035
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
these are the two things you're holding

1036
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,000
on to so that people with chronic

1037
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,320
illness get sicker and sicker and sicker

1038
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,760
and sicker instead of getting down to

1039
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,560
the bottom of everything and what's

1040
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,640
really happening instead of getting down

1041
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,119
to the bottom of what's really going on

1042
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,520
and what you need to do so we live our

1043
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,480
life we eat all the wrong Foods our

1044
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,839
liver gets totally filled up with so

1045
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,400
much poison and toxin completely filled

1046
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,800
up with so much poison and toxin that's

1047
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,440
what our liver does so that's all

1048
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,359
happening so we're aging faster okay and

1049
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,000
then we get the viral issues that we all

1050
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,560
have the viruses that get into everybody

1051
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,960
in so many different ways and the

1052
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,520
bacteria that gets in UTI UTI is a strep

1053
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,440
that means you have strep in your system

1054
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,680
sibo that's strep in your system I talk

1055
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,839
all about this in Liver Rescue if these

1056
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,560
are just Prime examples in 10 years

1057
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,200
every single person young adults mostly

1058
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,319
women young women are going to be all

1059
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,680
diagnosed with sibo all diagnosed with

1060
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:36,680
sibo in the next coming 10 years all of

1061
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
them they're all going to be going to

1062
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,359
the doctors they're all going to be

1063
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,440
going to even conventional doctors they

1064
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,960
be diagnosed with with a small

1065
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,119
intestinal overgrowth back bacterial

1066
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,000
overgrowth and they're going to be

1067
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,520
diagnosed with sibo that's all strep in

1068
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,040
the gut still to this day science

1069
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,359
research doesn't know it's strep but

1070
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,240
it's actually strep and so we have all

1071
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:57,520
these things they're producing toxins we

1072
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,000
have old salts inside of us caked in

1073
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,040
there we got other poisons

1074
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,440
petrochemicals we got Plastics that are

1075
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,040
inside of us we got Pharmaceuticals

1076
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,280
inside our liver inside our brain inside

1077
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,359
our body in different places it builds

1078
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,800
up it builds up it builds up and then

1079
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,480
then in many women in most women it's

1080
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,200
blamed on menopause all the symptoms

1081
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,720
when it's not menopause all the symptoms

1082
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,599
that's toxic blood that's occurring

1083
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,079
that's the liver being toxic with

1084
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,800
viruses such as Epstein bar toxins and

1085
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,720
poisons that built up for years decades

1086
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,599
from Bad suntan lotions okay from Bad

1087
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,119
perfumes from Bad lotions from bad colog

1088
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,040
from from anything from Hairspray

1089
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,680
whatever it is built up over the years

1090
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,359
and and that's just some things that's

1091
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,040
not even the foods and the chemicals

1092
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,520
that are in foods and preservatives it's

1093
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,319
all in the liver it's all in the blood

1094
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,359
the blood gets toxic and then you start

1095
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,920
getting around 35 38 years old and many

1096
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:55,760
women it's a lot earlier now they're all

1097
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,440
Expos they're all experiencing menopause

1098
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,800
symptoms like just earlier it's not

1099
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,119
menopause it's the hot flashes it's the

1100
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,680
liver being toxic it's the it's all of

1101
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,960
that heart palpitations the liver being

1102
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,640
toxic with viruses releasing poison

1103
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,400
going into the heart and creating heart

1104
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,000
palpitations that's how it works but

1105
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,280
toxic blood is the heart palpitations

1106
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the toxic blood it's it's all of that I

1107
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
mean that's how that's how the hot

1108
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,680
flashes and it's blamed on hormones so

1109
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,160
then they're given steroids which are

1110
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,280
hormones they give steroids to try to

1111
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,200
calm the symptoms down and make

1112
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,680

I've been doing lemon water since I was

1254
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,240
four years old but you know it's a long

1255
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,520
time ago but it's been around it's been

1256
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,760
around for a long time and they were

1257
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,599
doing lemon water in Italy long long ago

1258
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,359
squeezing lemon and water adding a

1259
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,920
little honey if you want to add a little

1260
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,160
honey if that's what you want to do

1261
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,559
that's the only way you can get that

1262
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,480
lemon water in you then add a little

1263
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,000
honey I'm okay with that and so the

1264
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,520
whole deal is is that it's about getting

1265
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,920
the blood less toxic so you want the

1266
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,319
lemon water every morning you want your

1267
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,480
celery juice you want your heavy metal

1268
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,760
detox smoothie if that's all you can do

1269
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,920
and the rest is whatever you're doing

1270
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,880
the rest is whatever not so good food

1271
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,800
choices or not so good whatever then

1272
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,640
that's all you can do I'm totally on

1273
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,640
board with that but but it's going to

1274
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,480
help so you don't get dark circles under

1275
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,319
your eyes so you don't get varicose

1276
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,119
veins and spider veins on your body so

1277
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,119
you don't get cellulite on your body so

1278
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,440
you don't get weight gain because your

1279
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,960
liver getting so tired and so inflamed

1280
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,640
and from so many poisons and and toxins

1281
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,839
in your liver that are never being

1282
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,000
cleansed or cleaned out and viruses and

1283
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:20,800
bacteria so the weight gain happens it

1284
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,640
hits everybody and their weight starts

1285
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,160
coming on their weight just starts

1286
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,640
pouring on it hits everybody it's so you

1287
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,760
don't get any of that too so you stay

1288
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,440
away from all that weight gain that's

1289
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,359
another thing too getting your toxic

1290
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,680
blood cleaned up gets weight problems

1291
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,160
behind you it gets you in a better place

1292
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,000
so you can lose weight and start healing

1293
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,400
because viruses won't be able to pollute

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,839
your liver so much they won't be able to

1295
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,079
affect you so much and in Liver Rescue I

1296
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:49,440
talk about all the different supplements

1297
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,040
and things you can do for viruses and

1298
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,520
all the different conditions you know

1299
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,359
that people have but the thing is is you

1300
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,680
this is the big start of getting your

1301
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:01,280
blood less toxic the other big start is

1302
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,520
lower your fats lower your fats and do

1303
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,839
not listen to the trend out there when

1304
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,119
they tell you when they tell you protein

1305
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,079
protein protein they're telling you fat

1306
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,319
fat fat fat fat that's what they're

1307
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,559
telling you so be careful so if you're

1308
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,920
totally into animal protein reduce it

1309
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,599
I'm not saying get rid of it if you

1310
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
don't want to get rid of it fine I'm not

1311
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,079
I'm not against it I'm not against

1312
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,359
animal protein you but reduce it if

1313
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,800
you're if you're if you're plant-based

1314
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,480
or you call yourself vegan or whatever

1315
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,760
it is you're plant-based

1316
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,040
then reduce your nuts and seeds lower

1317
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,359
the fats reduce any oils reduce nuts and

1318
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,000
seeds cut your avocado down to size a

1319
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,920
little bit cut your tahini down a little

1320
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,400
bit cut your cashews down cut them down

1321
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,280
so you can lower your fat because what

1322
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,200
happens is the higher the fat levels you

1323
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,920
have in your bloodstream the more toxic

1324
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,920
your blood stays remember that your

1325
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:52,440
blood will stay toxic so much

1326
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:55,079
longer so much longer the fat suspends

1327
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,160
the toxins it suspends it it doesn't

1328
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,400
even let it leave the kidneys it doesn't

1329
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,359
even let it leave the body and these

1330
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,119
high protein diets whether they're vegan

1331
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,400
high protein whether they're animal you

1332
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,920
know high protein paleo high protein

1333
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,319
they're high fat for God's sakes and you

1334
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,079
know what happens in the end heart

1335
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,359
disease cardiovascular disease down the

1336
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,599
road problems everywhere even if it's

1337
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:19,599
healthy fats you get problems too much

1338
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:22,040
fat harms the liver causes it to get

1339
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,640
congested causes the heart to have to

1340
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,119
work harder the more fat in your

1341
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,040
bloodstream the harder your part heart

1342
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,960
has to work to draw that blood through

1343
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,280
it tires it out for down the road and I

1344
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,520
don't care if you're exercising every

1345
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,960
day and you're taking care of yourself

1346
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,720
on that level and you're in shape and

1347
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,680
you're fit you don't think people die of

1348
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,319
heart attacks like that I see it every

1349
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,680
day I see it happen all the time it's

1350
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,680
like wait a minute how did that

1351
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,000
38-year-old guy die of a heart attack he

1352
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,520
was in the gym every day did you see how

1353
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
cut he was how come he's how how come

1354
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,640
he's dead how come he's gone I mean it's

1355
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,720
unbelievable

1356
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,000
because because you you're still putting

1357
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,160
in all that high fat in every single day

1358
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,760
which is under the Guist of high protein

1359
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,880
and then viruses can accumulate and then

1360
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,640
you can have a stroke viruses can

1361
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,200
accumulate because it's hiding viruses

1362
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,119
love to hide in the liver and hide under

1363
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,280
all that fat you can have a fatty liver

1364
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,680
but not have a scrap of fat on your skin

1365
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,200
on your body yet and have a fatty liver

1366
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,480
and not even get diagnosed by the doctor

1367
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,920
of having a fatty liver because they'll

1368
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,280
see you and be like whoo you're in good

1369
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,520
shape and you walk out so it getting the

1370
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,880
toxins out is also part of lowering the

1371
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,920
fats so what does that mean if you're

1372
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,599
doing grass-fed beef once a day I mean

1373
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,160
if you're doing it twice a day once a

1374
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,760
day if you're doing chicken at dinner

1375
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,200
grass-fed beef for lunch grassfed beef

1376
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,359
for dinner chicken for lunch get rid of

1377
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,160
the chicken do it once a day we do it

1378
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:44,920
once every other day get rid of eggs get

1379
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,520
rid of cheese milk butter I don't care

1380
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,240
if it's free range I don't care what it

1381
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,920
is get rid of eggs dairy all dairy

1382
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,640
products it's all high in fat all it

1383
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,960
does it stops you from being able to

1384
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,319
detox and get rid of the toxic blood it

1385
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,520
stops you from being able to protect

1386
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:00,160
yourself from all the different

1387
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,800
autoimmune diseases which aren't the

1388
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,400
body attacking itself but viruses

1389
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,000
attacking the body all the different

1390
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,000
autoimmune diseases that everybody's

1391
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,880
coming down with out there you want the

1392
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,200
blood less fatty so we can get the

1393
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,559
toxins out because everybody's blood is

1394
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,800
toxic I've seen people's blood so

1395
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,760
dehydrated and so toxic that when

1396
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,520
they've gone to get even blood work it's

1397
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,319
literally like it was it was like hard

1398
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,760
for them to draw blood out of them hard

1399
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:27,400
for the for the practitioners to draw

1400
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,000
blood out of their body and the

1401
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,800
practitioners didn't know why it's

1402
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,319
because you also get dehydrated with

1403
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,280
dirty blood you get chronically

1404
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:36,520
chronically dehydrated that's why I'm

1405
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,160
saying do the celery juice in the

1406
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,040
morning or cucumber juice if you really

1407
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,359
have to do the do the um do the lemon

1408
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,000
water in the morning do the heavy metal

1409
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,440
detox smoothie have a salad for lunch

1410
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,240
maybe a little bit of avocado in the

1411
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,640
salad how about that have tomatoes on

1412
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,040
there don't be afraid of tomatoes God

1413
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,440
for a bid they're life-saving you have

1414
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,200
tomatoes on there cucumbers on your

1415
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,960
salad lettuce is spinach okay and then

1416
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,040
you know and and put a little avocado on

1417
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,599
there if you really want you can do that

1418
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,079
squeeze some orange juice on there

1419
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,920
squeeze some oranges on there put some

1420
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,880
dates on there you know you can just you

1421
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,400
don't want your fats too high so you can

1422
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,119
put a little avocado in that one if you

1423
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,000
don't have avocado you can put some hemp

1424
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,359
seeds on there but you don't want it too

1425
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,599
high I mean that's that's if you're

1426
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:18,040
plant-based you know you're doing that

1427
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,599
and if you're not plant-based and you
