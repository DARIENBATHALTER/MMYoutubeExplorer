[3.12 - 7.84] are you seeing it out there people catch
[5.12 - 10.76] a bug they get sick they're coughing
[7.84 - 13.36] they're lungs out they're really sick
[10.76 - 16.00] they got fevers going up and down they
[13.36 - 18.28] start to recover they go to a doctor
[16.00 - 21.68] they get on an antibiotic whatever it is
[18.28 - 23.88] they start to recover and then they stay
[21.68 - 26.36] sick they think they're going to recover
[23.88 - 28.92] and bounce back completely but they're
[26.36 - 30.92] dragging or 2 weeks later they're doing
[28.92 - 33.24] a little better and then it hits them
[30.92 - 35.56] and they're dragging and they're going
[33.24 - 38.00] down and what's happening out there
[35.56 - 40.56] people are getting sick and then they're
[38.00 - 42.48] falling into this chronically ill
[40.56 - 44.08] trigger and now they're getting all
[42.48 - 46.84] these different things like brain fog
[44.08 - 49.80] and weird tingles and numbness on their
[46.84 - 51.92] body and aches and pains and fatigue and
[49.80 - 53.52] brain fog again and they just don't feel
[51.92 - 56.12] themselves and now they're triggered
[53.52 - 57.64] into something entirely different
[56.12 - 60.12] because of the bugs going around right
[57.64 - 62.48] now right now in New England in the
[60.12 - 65.28] United States there's a stomach flu
[62.48 - 67.32] neuro virus and it's pounding the crap
[65.28 - 70.08] out of people right now up there and
[67.32 - 73.32] it's heading through through the United
[70.08 - 76.88] States and around the world and it's
[73.32 - 78.36] giving people like insane di area and
[76.88 - 80.52] gut disturbances and we're going to
[78.36 - 82.00] cover that a little bit cuz I want to
[80.52 - 84.64] talk about that like what does it do in
[82.00 - 87.04] the gut like what happens there's people
[84.64 - 89.96] all about you know microbiome what
[87.04 - 92.00] happens if you get the neuro virus and
[89.96 - 93.72] you got the stomach flu and it's ripping

[102.28 - 106.36] all great what's it like nobody really
[104.84 - 108.48] talks about that they don't talk about
[106.36 - 110.80] what happens when boom you get that
[108.48 - 113.28] neuro virus and you got the stomach flu
[110.80 - 114.96] and then is your microbiome is is that
[113.28 - 116.60] going to get back to normal wasn't even
[114.96 - 119.20] normal to begin with and is it going to
[116.60 - 121.00] get back to normal eventually or is it
[119.20 - 122.64] going to be out of B now for next
[121.00 - 125.32] another 2 years until you get another

[195.40 - 198.76] but I'm here to talk about our immune
[196.84 - 200.56] system and how it's getting pretty beat
[198.76 - 201.76] up these days with what people are going
[200.56 - 203.28] through do you know anybody that's
[201.76 - 204.76] coughing do you know anybody that's got
[203.28 - 206.92] a sore throat and a fever do you know
[204.76 - 208.52] anybody who's been hit with anything
[206.92 - 210.84] that's going on because people have been
[208.52 - 213.36] getting hit it's like a insurgence of it
[210.84 - 215.44] insurgence of it happening right now
[213.36 - 217.36] this is like one of those hot spots
[215.44 - 219.56] we're in where it's just really starting
[217.36 - 221.24] to pick up pace I hear it all the time
[219.56 - 224.40] people are sick for a month with it
[221.24 - 229.28] coughing out their lungs the whole bit
[224.40 - 233.60] but then to add insult to injury there
[229.28 - 238.08] is a Norovirus stomach flu hyper catchy
[233.60 - 240.16] hyper catchy that's actually steaming
[238.08 - 242.04] streaming right out of new England land
[240.16 - 245.36] right now and it's going to be cutting
[242.04 - 247.28] across the country and you know overseas
[245.36 - 249.76] and everywhere else and that one really
[247.28 - 251.28] sucks really really sucks so what I'm
[249.76 - 253.60] doing right now is the reason why I'm
[251.28 - 256.60] even here is because I'm saying are you
[253.60 - 258.20] taking care of your immune system are
[256.60 - 260.44] you taking care of your immune system
[258.20 - 263.52] right so I have my family on this right
[260.44 - 266.20] here just a safeguard I need a safeguard
[263.52 - 268.64] my family and my closest friends you
[266.20 - 272.00] know safeguarding them too and all that
[268.64 - 274.08] so that's the total immune blend do you
[272.00 - 275.52] have it and what's crazy out there is
[274.08 - 276.80] what I'm seeing right now is all these
[275.52 - 278.12] different supplements are coming out
[276.80 - 279.44] it's like crazy right and they're
[278.12 - 281.20] claiming all this stuff claiming all
[279.44 - 283.28] this stuff but they don't work they
[281.20 - 285.44] don't work and you look what's in them
[283.28 - 287.52] it's like yeah all poor quality crap all
[285.44 - 289.68] garbage whatever you name it and they
[287.52 - 291.60] just don't work it's so sad that's what
[289.68 - 294.04] I'm seeing out there you guys know I
[291.60 - 297.44] endorse these guys this is vimer g v is
[294.04 - 299.28] in Victor i m is in Mary E RG y I'll get
[297.44 - 303.24] a closeup too on this right here this is
[299.28 - 305.40] the to immune I'm living off of it to
[303.24 - 307.12] protect myself cuz I can't get sick
[305.40 - 308.24] right now with any kind of cold or
[307.12 - 310.72] anything like
[308.24 - 312.36] flu anything like that I use the term
[310.72 - 315.76] cold but you know how there's no colds
[312.36 - 317.04] anyway but it's this back in stock it's
[315.76 - 318.72] back and stock so I give you a little
[317.04 - 319.92] closeup on this before I move on because
[318.72 - 321.16] we're going to talk about some stuff in
[319.92 - 323.32] the immune system which is really
[321.16 - 324.04] important so that's total immune blend
[323.32 - 327.00] right
[324.04 - 329.08] there there it is that's the vimergy I
[327.00 - 330.16] don't know if you guys see it there it
[329.08 - 334.12] is
[330.16 - 337.00] very important critical critical um
[334.12 - 339.28] resource right there it's got the time
[337.00 - 342.32] it's got the Mullin it's back in stock
[339.28 - 344.48] it's sold out like this when it came out
[342.32 - 347.28] so a lot of people armed themselves and
[344.48 - 349.88] armed their immune systems for what was
[347.28 - 352.28] coming but I want to talk about even
[349.88 - 354.72] more than that I want to go into like
[352.28 - 356.56] what people are dealing with post
[354.72 - 359.24] getting sick and what they're dealing
[356.56 - 361.28] with pre getting sick because everybody
[359.24 - 363.20] hasn't immune system problems and that's
[361.28 - 365.32] that's a big thing right there all on
[363.20 - 367.84] its own if you got a
[365.32 - 371.24] symptom if you got any kind of symptom
[367.84 - 373.64] if you got any kind of condition if
[371.24 - 375.64] you've been diagnosed with a condition
[373.64 - 379.04] if you're struggling with any kind of
[375.64 - 381.08] symptom immune system right there
[379.04 - 383.36] anything people who are dealing with
[381.08 - 384.68] cancer immune systems broke down people
[383.36 - 388.56] are dealing with all kinds of different
[384.68 - 391.52] things like fibro and ra and lime and
[388.56 - 392.88] anything immune system people that're
[391.52 - 395.04] dealing with all kinds of aches and
[392.88 - 396.92] pains and Tinkles and numbness and
[395.04 - 399.92] vertigo and ringing in the ears and
[396.92 - 404.16] dizziness and balance issues immune
[399.92 - 406.20] system we have injured depleted
[404.16 - 408.84] diminished immune systems and that's
[406.20 - 410.36] what people live with every single day
[408.84 - 412.12] if you know somebody and they're getting
[410.36 - 413.32] things and they're getting symptoms and
[412.12 - 415.84] they're
[413.32 - 419.04] struggling yeah it's their immune system
[415.84 - 420.96] it's struggling that's the whole point
[419.04 - 423.24] it can't handle exposures it can't
[420.96 - 425.12] handle the toxic heavy metal exposures
[423.24 - 426.76] and then the herbicide and the fungicide
[425.12 - 429.72] exposures and the
[426.76 - 431.72] fragrances and the caffeine addiction it
[429.72 - 434.36] can't handle the immune system can't
[431.72 - 436.72] handle that so many people are drowning
[434.36 - 439.08] themselves with coffee and espresso
[436.72 - 440.92] drinks and they're just beating the crap
[439.08 - 444.24] out of their immune system so immune
[440.92 - 447.24] system is just under attack all the time
[444.24 - 450.16] and So eventually what that leads us to
[447.24 - 453.56] is a sickness no matter what
[450.16 - 455.36] but everyone is going to get a symptom
[453.56 - 456.72] no matter what you see somebody out
[455.36 - 458.00] there right now they're on social like
[456.72 - 459.64] yeah I'm doing this and do and that I'm
[458.00 - 462.00] Into Fitness I'm into this you're going
[459.64 - 464.24] to have a symptom you're going to have a
[462.00 - 465.48] symptom it's going to come later maybe
[464.24 - 467.44] but you're going to be pushed over the
[465.48 - 468.96] edge too many exposures your immune
[467.44 - 470.72] system is going to finally kick down and
[468.96 - 473.96] you're going to be in the immune system
[470.72 - 475.84] pit just like everybody else so keeping
[473.96 - 478.44] our immune system strong is critical
[475.84 - 481.20] having immune system power is
[478.44 - 482.36] critical having it strong and you'll
[481.20 - 485.00] hear things out there like you don't
[482.36 - 488.48] want your immune system too strong oh
[485.00 - 491.44] you don't really like okay whose immune
[488.48 - 494.40] system is too strong somebody tell me
[491.44 - 496.76] whose immune system is so strong you
[494.40 - 498.40] know I mean even like the best
[496.76 - 499.68] influencers out there talking about
[498.40 - 501.16] health and everything they're dealing
[499.68 - 503.72] with immune system problems that's how
[501.16 - 506.48] they got into it anyway they got into
[503.72 - 507.72] the health industry in general because
[506.48 - 509.60] they got problems and they're seeing
[507.72 - 511.60] their naturopath and their herbalist and
[509.60 - 514.16] their acupuncturist and their MD and
[511.60 - 516.36] their do and they're seeing everybody
[514.16 - 517.84] because they got all these problems
[516.36 - 519.32] because everybody's immune system is
[517.84 - 521.16] challenged that's the day and age we're
[519.32 - 523.08] in we're in the age of the quickening
[521.16 - 524.88] right here this is the quickening where
[523.08 - 527.36] [ __ ] just speeds up and speeds up and
[524.88 - 529.64] speeds up stuff is happening real fast
[527.36 - 531.92] out there and sickness and disease is
[529.64 - 534.80] climbing at an all-time high and it's
[531.92 - 537.32] staying climbing and climbing and
[534.80 - 541.56] climbing
[537.32 - 544.28] 2030 so many people are going to be sick
[541.56 - 545.92] 2035 it's going to be unbelievable on
[544.28 - 548.16] how many people are going to be sick
[545.92 - 549.76] everybody's going to be sick and
[548.16 - 551.56] everybody's going to be on social
[549.76 - 554.12] talking about their
[551.56 - 556.88] sicknesses that's what's going to happen
[554.12 - 559.84] it's going to dominate social
[556.88 - 561.92] entirely to a point where all articles
[559.84 - 563.88] out there all the media is going to be
[561.92 - 566.04] talking about sickness everybody's going
[563.88 - 569.88] to be talking about sickness stories
[566.04 - 572.32] this is just what it's going to be by 20
[569.88 - 573.44] 2030 nothing but sickness sickness
[572.32 - 575.48] sickness
[573.44 - 577.04] everywhere and that's the world we live
[575.48 - 578.72] in that's the world we're going to be
[577.04 - 580.36] living and and that's how crazy it
[578.72 - 582.24] really is when you really think about it
[580.36 - 584.00] right I mean did you ever expect that
[582.24 - 587.24] did you ever expect
[584.00 - 588.56] that yeah you're not alone so let's talk
[587.24 - 591.44] about the immune system a little bit and
[588.56 - 593.68] why it's so important to support it not
[591.44 - 599.00] just support it rebuild
[593.68 - 600.92] it rebuild it critical really is writing
[599.00 - 603.40] for truth on IG says do you take the
[600.92 - 607.68] total immune blend every day even when
[603.40 - 611.64] not sick I do I take it every single day
[607.68 - 614.40] even when not sick I take it every day
[611.64 - 616.16] okay but you can take it every day right
[614.40 - 619.44] do what your doctor wants to do but I
[616.16 - 621.32] tell my family you can take it every day
[619.44 - 623.64] but you can take a smaller dosage if
[621.32 - 625.36] you're not sick every single day then
[623.64 - 627.44] when you get sick or you're struggling
[625.36 - 629.36] with something you can increase the the
[627.44 - 633.12] dosage to what your whatever doctor
[629.36 - 637.08] leaves or however what's in it a thyme
[633.12 - 640.24] blend of thyme and Mullen and a little
[637.08 - 642.92] touch of zinc it's this perfect
[640.24 - 645.52] combination right here and what people
[642.92 - 648.48] don't realize it's the quality of the
[645.52 - 651.36] time on top of it it's the quality of
[648.48 - 654.28] the Mullen that you don't get in other
[651.36 - 656.12] places it doesn't happen it just doesn't
[654.28 - 658.68] I know I know the quality I know what
[656.12 - 661.64] they do I know how they do it and it's
[658.68 - 664.12] unbelievable able it's about making sure
[661.64 - 666.52] that alcohol wasn't used that alcohol is
[664.12 - 668.80] not involved at any level making sure
[666.52 - 672.40] all these different things matter that
[668.80 - 674.60] this is really clean but the real thing
[672.40 - 675.84] not everybody saying good quality this
[674.60 - 676.56] is good quality everybody's allowed to
[675.84 - 677.92] say that did you know that you're
[676.56 - 679.92] allowed to say everything's good quality
[677.92 - 681.76] did you know that anybody who just opens
[679.92 - 682.88] up a door hangs a shingle and sells
[681.76 - 685.32] something they're allowed to say our
[682.88 - 688.24] quality is great nothing beats our
[685.32 - 691.20] quality there is a difference huge
[688.24 - 694.00] difference that's important to know it
[691.20 - 698.52] really is on IG Roxy says where can I
[694.00 - 699.92] buy it that's vimergy V is invictor i m

[715.72 - 721.88] little
[717.16 - 722.96] bit all right couple of things to know
[721.88 - 726.40] one
[722.96 - 729.64] is why are immune systems so chopped up
[726.40 - 732.52] why are they so beat up and that's
[729.64 - 733.80] something that nobody really talks about
[732.52 - 736.96] they're just like this is immune
[733.80 - 739.52] supportive immune supportive everybody's
[736.96 - 741.84] immune system is just beaten to a pulp
[739.52 - 744.08] basically and that's why everybody's so
[741.84 - 746.44] sick it's struggling immune system you
[744.08 - 749.48] got to remember that if there's anything
[746.44 - 753.96] someone's dealing with instantly the
[749.48 - 756.28] immune system is under siege Under Siege
[753.96 - 758.44] if someone's got panic attacks and they
[756.28 - 761.00] got the Titan chest and they got that
[758.44 - 762.08] vagus nerve I talk about that vag nerves
[761.00 - 763.80] the
[762.08 - 765.64] inflammation and they're dealing with
[763.80 - 768.92] all kinds of anxiety and panic and all
[765.64 - 770.76] these other things immune system
[768.92 - 773.40] everything is like that thyroid
[770.76 - 776.04] condition at all thyroid anybody
[773.40 - 780.68] hypothyroid hyperthyroid any kind of
[776.04 - 784.04] thyroid problems at all anything grave
[780.68 - 787.24] whatever it is nodules in the thyroid
[784.04 - 789.68] whatever it is immune system was
[787.24 - 792.24] challenged the thyroids immune system
[789.68 - 794.48] was challenged the liver's immune system
[792.24 - 796.68] was challenged and then weakened and
[794.48 - 798.60] then kicked down a notch so people walk
[796.68 - 801.12] around with weak immune systems that's
[798.60 - 804.32] what they do all day long and then the
[801.12 - 806.72] thyroid disorders creep up and then the
[804.32 - 808.76] panic and the aches and pains creep up
[806.72 - 810.64] and then the vertigo and the tentis and
[808.76 - 813.00] the Les and numbness and the body aches
[810.64 - 816.52] and pains and the trigeminal neuralgia
[813.00 - 818.32] all creep up because their immune system
[816.52 - 821.24] is suffering their immune system is
[818.32 - 824.08] struggling so very important to know so
[821.24 - 826.76] let's talk about like stomach flu I want
[824.08 - 830.64] to go into that a little bit stomach
[826.76 - 832.12] flu okay so the reason why I would take
[830.64 - 833.64] like something every single day or I
[832.12 - 836.16] tell family to take something every
[833.64 - 838.60] single day like I tell my family take a
[836.16 - 840.00] little bit of this take a little bit of
[838.60 - 842.36] the
[840.00 - 844.72] every single day right little bit of the
[842.36 - 846.64] golden seal every single day this is
[844.72 - 848.36] what I tell my family to do all the time
[846.64 - 850.44] and a little bit of B12 and I want to
[848.36 - 852.64] talk about why B12 is critical cuz when
[850.44 - 855.76] we catch something like the neuro virus
[852.64 - 857.64] or white lung yeah which is really
[855.76 - 860.08] hurting a lot of people I mean they get
[857.64 - 863.24] scar tissue in the lung that lasts
[860.08 - 866.08] forever I mean that's just unfair like
[863.24 - 868.52] why do they put bugs out there like this
[866.08 - 870.24] so that we get injuries in our lungs and
[868.52 - 871.76] then for lifetime we actually have scar
[870.24 - 875.28] tissue in our lungs like does that make
[871.76 - 879.20] any sense so I tell my friends and
[875.28 - 881.68] family it's critical to get B12 in you
[879.20 - 883.64] after especially after you've been hit
[881.68 - 887.76] with something because you need that
[883.64 - 890.72] extra B12 to power up the nerves so
[887.76 - 892.48] important that alone okay and so what
[890.72 - 894.28] I'm telling my family right now with all
[892.48 - 897.20] these these hard times of people getting
[894.28 - 899.88] sick cuz it's it's really sad when you
[897.20 - 901.52] see somebody really struggling they get
[899.88 - 903.80] what feels like a cold to start with
[901.52 - 905.80] then it then it lingers then it runs
[903.80 - 908.16] into a fever and up and down and then
[905.80 - 910.40] after that when they're better they're
[908.16 - 912.12] not better because now their immune
[910.40 - 915.28] system was dropped and they were
[912.12 - 918.16] triggered into something else an epine
[915.28 - 920.52] bar rising up out of nowhere herb
[918.16 - 921.88] simplex one rising up from nowhere
[920.52 - 924.16] because that's what's happening to
[921.88 - 927.12] people people are getting shingles a
[924.16 - 929.60] month after they get white lung a month
[927.12 - 931.12] later they have the shingles because
[929.60 - 933.44] their immune system was so kicked down
[931.12 - 935.72] to the bottom that the jingles virus
[933.44 - 937.96] said this is my time to shine and then
[935.72 - 939.88] it comes up and it just boom it's up
[937.96 - 941.00] there let's talk about the Norovirus
[939.88 - 942.40] that's coming around and it's
[941.00 - 946.12] circulating right now and it's it's
[942.40 - 948.16] kicking up so right now there's a
[946.12 - 951.00] stomach bug out there and what people
[948.16 - 955.72] don't realize is that a stomach bug can
[951.00 - 959.56] knock your gut balance off for a really
[955.72 - 961.68] long time really long time but what you
[959.56 - 965.04] what you'll never see out there is what
[961.68 - 967.52] happens inside the intestinal tract when
[965.04 - 969.72] that bug is around so let's go into that
[967.52 - 972.00] let's let's try to like makeshift a
[969.72 - 975.24] little bit of an intestinal track
[972.00 - 978.76] okay so let's do that we'll make shift a
[975.24 - 983.08] little bit of a a colon here
[978.76 - 984.84] right all right and then we'll just do a
[983.08 - 987.92] little intestinal track in the center
[984.84 - 989.52] here if you guys can see this
[987.92 - 992.48] okay
[989.52 - 996.00] so you pick up the stomach flu pick up
[992.48 - 999.08] the neuro virus you get it in your
[996.00 - 1000.88] mouth just goes in you you breathing in
[999.08 - 1005.08] it's on your tongue now it's heading
[1000.88 - 1008.52] down to your gut okay and it's on its
[1005.08 - 1011.76] way so that virus is getting there okay
[1008.52 - 1013.56] virus goes down the dadum it's it starts
[1011.76 - 1015.52] in your stomach right it goes down your
[1013.56 - 1018.96] stomach in your dadum it's heading in
[1015.52 - 1022.24] there and what that virus is doing is
[1018.96 - 1025.24] it's multiplying really fast and it's
[1022.24 - 1027.72] feeding off of foods that you eat so
[1025.24 - 1031.16] it's multiplying it's exploding so what
[1027.72 - 1034.48] a stomach virus does is it proliferates
[1031.16 - 1038.08] at a speed no other bug Pro proliferates
[1034.48 - 1040.64] no other bug fires up to that degree to
[1038.08 - 1043.76] multiplies to that degree spawns to that
[1040.64 - 1047.84] degree but the neuro virus
[1043.76 - 1050.96] explodes and it feeds off of undigested
[1047.84 - 1052.72] proteins it feeds off of gluten that's
[1050.96 - 1055.64] in the system from something you ate a
[1052.72 - 1059.56] week ago yeah a week ago it feeds off of
[1055.64 - 1062.56] any egg residue egg material any kind of
[1059.56 - 1065.28] egg material in your gut it feeds off of
[1062.56 - 1067.48] that and then it feeds off of any dairy
[1065.28 - 1070.00] products and then it feeds off of other
[1067.48 - 1073.60] things it'll feed off of soy
[1070.00 - 1076.16] potentially it'll feed off of virtually
[1073.60 - 1079.76] anything right so what it does is it
[1076.16 - 1084.56] feeds and it explodes it
[1079.76 - 1087.60] produces itself rapidly like rapidly and
[1084.56 - 1091.12] it's highly toxic so what the Norovirus
[1087.60 - 1093.28] is is it's a bug that when it produces
[1091.12 - 1096.28] the bug then goes to the intestinal
[1093.28 - 1098.64] lining walls and it starts to make
[1096.28 - 1100.28] divots it starts to basically try to
[1098.64 - 1102.64] poke holes in your intestinal tract and
[1100.28 - 1105.00] your colon but nobody talks about this
[1102.64 - 1107.48] they're just like you got a stomach bug
[1105.00 - 1109.76] you know that's it wait till it's over
[1107.48 - 1111.76] and then take a probiotic
[1109.76 - 1113.24] so that's what they'll say some of the
[1111.76 - 1115.76] best functional medicine doctors will be
[1113.24 - 1118.40] like well you got a stomach flu um go to
[1115.76 - 1120.72] the hospital you got a stomach flu and
[1118.40 - 1123.72] then make sure you get on our probiotics
[1120.72 - 1126.64] at our clinic or or our doctor's office
[1123.72 - 1128.52] make sure you get on our probiotics so
[1126.64 - 1130.28] that's all they do but what people don't
[1128.52 - 1135.64] realize is that
[1130.28 - 1141.08] virus is mean really mean so stomach
[1135.64 - 1146.44] bugs stomach flu EXP load they multiply
[1141.08 - 1150.84] fast real fast thousands upon thousands
[1146.44 - 1153.36] of replicas then all those bugs end up
[1150.84 - 1156.84] attaching themselves to everything the
[1153.36 - 1158.76] stomach lining the dadum lining the
[1156.84 - 1162.28] small in top of the small intestinal
[1158.76 - 1164.60] track all through and as it's happening
[1162.28 - 1167.24] if you have a weakened immune system
[1164.60 - 1170.28] it's not slowing it down it's not
[1167.24 - 1173.76] stopping it and instead that person is
[1170.28 - 1176.20] now diarrhea they got stomach pains
[1173.76 - 1177.44] they're really nauseous they got a fever
[1176.20 - 1180.52] cranking
[1177.44 - 1183.56] up because their immune system isn't
[1180.52 - 1186.56] stopping it it's not breaking it down so
[1183.56 - 1189.44] their immune cells are not there's not
[1186.56 - 1191.96] enough immune cells number one to stop
[1189.44 - 1194.32] the neuro virus to that degree and if
[1191.96 - 1197.56] someone has a weakened immune system
[1194.32 - 1200.24] then they really have very small amounts
[1197.56 - 1203.64] of immune cells going into this area
[1200.24 - 1206.88] trying to stop the neuro virus so the
[1203.64 - 1209.28] neuro virus the stomach flu the stomach
[1206.88 - 1211.80] bugs what they do is they attack the
[1209.28 - 1214.68] Linings of the small intestinal tract
[1211.80 - 1216.16] and this is why people get Pockets later
[1214.68 - 1218.04] this is why people get divots
[1216.16 - 1220.08] diverticulitis
[1218.04 - 1223.04] diverticulosis this is why people end up
[1220.08 - 1226.24] with crohn's later on meaning a trigger
[1223.04 - 1228.68] to get into Crohn's where other bugs can
[1226.24 - 1231.24] actually contribute it's all about not
[1228.68 - 1232.72] knocking the immune system down allowing
[1231.24 - 1234.84] other problems to happen there's people
[1232.72 - 1238.04] who get stomach flu that never have a
[1234.84 - 1239.80] normal stomach intestinal track ever
[1238.04 - 1241.40] again in their life they don't know how
[1239.80 - 1243.52] to recover it they know don't know how
[1241.40 - 1246.08] to rebuild it they don't know about Mono
[1243.52 - 1248.68] eating from the medical medium book
[1246.08 - 1250.68] series they don't know about all these
[1248.68 - 1252.92] different things they can do they're
[1250.68 - 1256.40] just stuck their intestinal tract is
[1252.92 - 1259.68] rocked for a very long time and then if
[1256.40 - 1261.84] they're older and they're not younger
[1259.68 - 1263.16] and they're older it affects them even
[1261.84 - 1266.00] more because they already have
[1263.16 - 1269.60] intestinal tract issues on so many
[1266.00 - 1273.16] levels so the neuro virus explodes and
[1269.60 - 1275.20] then it attaches itself to the Linings
[1273.16 - 1278.16] of the intestinal tract and if you're
[1275.20 - 1280.00] somebody that has pockets of undigested
[1278.16 - 1282.00] protein from a weak liver that I talked
[1280.00 - 1284.32] about in the last episode or if you're
[1282.00 - 1287.12] somebody that's dealing with anything
[1284.32 - 1289.52] like putrified rancid fats that are
[1287.12 - 1291.76] caked along your intestinal track old
[1289.52 - 1295.16] feal matter that's just stuck there and
[1291.76 - 1300.08] plastered against the intestinal Linings
[1295.16 - 1302.32] and bad bacteria like strep it all Rises
[1300.08 - 1304.64] up so the neuro virus and the stomach
[1302.32 - 1307.68] flu and the stomach bugs go ripping
[1304.64 - 1311.24] through you and then it awakens all the
[1307.68 - 1314.20] strep all the staff all the tiny bits of
[1311.24 - 1316.12] SEI that you were keeping under control
[1314.20 - 1319.28] you know just managing your immune
[1316.12 - 1321.04] system was managing all this time and
[1319.28 - 1324.52] then what
[1321.04 - 1326.16] happens is we get triggered now we have
[1324.52 - 1329.68] all kinds of intestinal tract
[1326.16 - 1332.44] disturbances years later down the road a
[1329.68 - 1334.36] month later so as the virus is ripping
[1332.44 - 1336.40] through the gut it's clinging to the
[1334.36 - 1339.32] wall of the intestinal tract and it
[1336.40 - 1342.36] starts to try to burrow holes inside the
[1339.32 - 1345.16] intestinal tract just like white lung is
[1342.36 - 1347.92] doing to people when they're getting the
[1345.16 - 1350.48] C and they're getting the flu and the C
[1347.92 - 1353.64] and the RS V in the white lung right now
[1350.48 - 1357.56] and it's going in it's injuring lung
[1353.64 - 1359.56] sacks well the stomach flu is
[1357.56 - 1362.64] created
[1359.56 - 1364.44] manufactured to injure the lining of
[1362.64 - 1369.48] your intestinal
[1364.44 - 1372.56] tract stomach dadum and so forth it's
[1369.48 - 1373.72] there to scar tissue and burrow and
[1372.56 - 1379.16] weaken the
[1373.72 - 1382.36] lining and wake up other predator
[1379.16 - 1384.52] that lie inside of our intestinal tract
[1382.36 - 1386.56] like the strep and the seiff and
[1384.52 - 1388.16] different varieties of staff and the
[1386.56 - 1390.84] hpylori
[1388.16 - 1393.32] so as that neuro virus and that stomach
[1390.84 - 1395.28] flu is ripping through and exploding and
[1393.32 - 1397.00] people are having like explosions of
[1395.28 - 1398.60] diarrhea and they're sick and they're
[1397.00 - 1401.12] nauseous and they're throwing up or
[1398.60 - 1403.96] they're fevered and they're getting the
[1401.12 - 1406.04] runs and they're really struggling for a
[1403.96 - 1407.20] day or two sometimes a week right now
[1406.04 - 1409.08] there's one that's ripping through
[1407.20 - 1411.52] that's really messing people up
[1409.08 - 1414.12] and when that's happening it wakes up
[1411.52 - 1416.20] the strep it wakes up SEI it wakes up
[1414.12 - 1418.72] staff it wakes up other bugs like
[1416.20 - 1421.80] viruses that could be in the intestinal
[1418.72 - 1423.60] tract and then it tries to burrow holes
[1421.80 - 1428.04] in the Linings because that's what it
[1423.60 - 1431.20] does the bugs go in and they try to
[1428.04 - 1434.32] destroy tissue so they're cell
[1431.20 - 1437.20] destroyers the reason why we're having
[1434.32 - 1439.52] diarrhea and fever and everything else
[1437.20 - 1442.72] around it is cuz our body is
[1439.52 - 1444.84] reacting and mucus is being produced off
[1442.72 - 1447.04] the lining of her intestinal tract
[1444.84 - 1449.40] because it's burrowing little holes tiny
[1447.04 - 1451.76] little divots in our intestinal tract
[1449.40 - 1455.52] and so our intestinal tract is releasing
[1451.76 - 1459.36] gobs and gobs of mucus and water and
[1455.52 - 1462.64] mucus and it's just streaming out it's
[1459.36 - 1466.28] streaming out to try to defend against
[1462.64 - 1468.56] the Invader but the Invader causes a lot
[1466.28 - 1471.00] of Havoc reaches a lot reaks a lot of
[1468.56 - 1474.56] havoc and a probiotic is not going to
[1471.00 - 1476.68] fix it after a really bad stomach flu a
[1474.56 - 1480.44] fever and also intestinal tract being
[1476.68 - 1482.92] invaded like that it takes time to heal
[1480.44 - 1484.48] it takes time to eat the right Foods it
[1482.92 - 1486.88] takes time to understand what you're
[1484.48 - 1489.08] doing and it's critical to keep the
[1486.88 - 1490.60] immune system
[1489.08 - 1492.88] strong
[1490.60 - 1494.04] so I just wanted to show you that right
[1492.88 - 1498.00] there and there's other stuff to talk
[1494.04 - 1500.32] about cuz we are here talking about the
[1498.00 - 1501.92] fun stuff for sure all right then move
[1500.32 - 1503.64] this over a little
[1501.92 - 1506.72] bit
[1503.64 - 1509.56] okay it takes a tremendous amount of
[1506.72 - 1512.88] adrenaline to fend off any bug that's
[1509.56 - 1515.64] out there right now any kind of flu any
[1512.88 - 1517.56] kind of sea any kind of white lung RSV
[1515.64 - 1518.76] any kind of neuro virus or stomach virus
[1517.56 - 1521.76] it takes
[1518.76 - 1524.24] adrenaline heart rate goes
[1521.76 - 1527.44] up as you're getting sick your heart
[1524.24 - 1529.00] rate goes up that's how it works because
[1527.44 - 1532.00] epinephrine is being being released
[1529.00 - 1534.92] adrenaline is being released to try to
[1532.00 - 1538.20] protect you but adrenaline itself
[1534.92 - 1539.96] doesn't help the immune system so what
[1538.20 - 1543.04] these bugs do and these viruses do that
[1539.96 - 1546.44] get into us when they get into us our
[1543.04 - 1549.44] adrenals end up fire alarming it and
[1546.44 - 1552.48] releasing all this adrenaline to try to
[1549.44 - 1554.28] because that's actually this response
[1552.48 - 1556.48] this automics response that's happening
[1554.28 - 1559.60] immediately when an Invader enters into
[1556.48 - 1562.64] our system but as that's happening our
[1559.60 - 1564.08] immune cells are struggling even more
[1562.64 - 1566.04] because we have so much adrenaline
[1564.08 - 1570.72] pouring into our bloodstream and immune
[1566.04 - 1572.96] cells hate adrenaline hate adrenaline it
[1570.72 - 1574.72] holds them back it keeps them from
[1572.96 - 1577.64] functioning as good as they can function
[1574.72 - 1579.96] so our immune cells need
[1577.64 - 1582.96] fuel need
[1579.96 - 1586.44] fuel and that's why I talk about like I
[1582.96 - 1588.96] have my family and my closest friends on
[1586.44 - 1591.64] protocols I have them on
[1588.96 - 1593.80] supplements it's critical because when
[1591.64 - 1596.24] you get sick if you're somewhere and
[1593.80 - 1598.92] look no one has no one has it perfect
[1596.24 - 1600.28] where well man you know what I could be
[1598.92 - 1603.00] wrong about that there's people on
[1600.28 - 1605.92] Instagram that they never have to work a
[1603.00 - 1607.48] day in their life right they're young
[1605.92 - 1609.24] they come for money or something or
[1607.48 - 1611.32] they're just extremely wealthy or
[1609.24 - 1612.76] whatever it is everything's taken care
[1611.32 - 1615.08] of and all they have to do is sleep 12
[1612.76 - 1616.80] hours every night they could sleep as
[1615.08 - 1619.04] many hours as they want they don't have
[1616.80 - 1620.12] to stress out about work they don't have
[1619.04 - 1621.52] to they just worry about their
[1620.12 - 1622.72] appointments their stress is their
[1621.52 - 1624.60] appointments like I'm getting my
[1622.72 - 1626.48] lymphatic drainage here I'm getting this
[1624.60 - 1628.32] here I'm doing this here I'm going on a
[1626.48 - 1629.72] vacation here with my friends here I'm
[1628.32 - 1632.92] going to Europe whatever it is that's
[1629.72 - 1635.88] their stress right and there are people
[1632.92 - 1637.44] like that and they can at least protect
[1635.88 - 1639.80] themselves because they're not living
[1637.44 - 1641.64] with a lot of real life scenarios
[1639.80 - 1644.24] situations they're not trying to work
[1641.64 - 1645.84] three jobs to survive they don't have
[1644.24 - 1647.56] you know like all these problems in
[1645.84 - 1649.16] their life meaning from other family
[1647.56 - 1651.28] members or something happening and they
[1649.16 - 1653.48] don't you know there's a lot going on in
[1651.28 - 1655.04] a lot of people's lives and we can't
[1653.48 - 1657.20] help it because there's so many people
[1655.04 - 1659.92] that don't have that perfect life life
[1657.20 - 1661.48] where they can just relax all day long
[1659.92 - 1663.40] and never have to worry about working a
[1661.48 - 1664.72] day in their life you know there's a lot
[1663.40 - 1667.28] of people that are struggling and they
[1664.72 - 1669.12] have to fight to survive and when you do
[1667.28 - 1670.52] that right we're always up against a lot
[1669.12 - 1672.96] and it's important to keep our immune
[1670.52 - 1674.76] system strong and in the eventually
[1672.96 - 1676.68] someone who has it really good in their
[1674.76 - 1678.52] life and they're young and strong now
[1676.68 - 1680.20] still will get symptoms later they'll
[1678.52 - 1682.16] still wind up in trouble they'll still
[1680.20 - 1685.36] wind up sick I see it all the time but
[1682.16 - 1688.12] it usually comes later instead of
[1685.36 - 1690.80] early let's see sole purpose on IG says
[1688.12 - 1694.24] my fiance was just sick three times in
[1690.80 - 1697.36] six weeks flu bug stomach flu bug and
[1694.24 - 1699.56] then flu bug again now lots of crazy
[1697.36 - 1701.52] symptoms so he's joined me in medical
[1699.56 - 1703.64] medum protocols this week now that's
[1701.52 - 1704.64] exactly the example I'm so sorry you're
[1703.64 - 1706.52] going through that first of all I want
[1704.64 - 1708.68] to say that that's awful that's awful
[1706.52 - 1710.68] but that's how they set it up you have
[1708.68 - 1714.64] to understand that's how they set it up
[1710.68 - 1716.40] so that's what they do okay so let's do
[1714.64 - 1718.56] a a different little thing on the
[1716.40 - 1720.88] Whiteboard okay I don't know why my
[1718.56 - 1723.40] whiteboard doesn't really work that
[1720.88 - 1729.08] great I really don't

[1755.28 - 1759.92] that's what that is that's right that's
[1757.92 - 1762.76] the bug manufacturing
[1759.92 - 1764.64] plant yes
[1762.76 - 1768.68] indeed
[1764.64 - 1770.16] okay and here are some houses over here
[1768.68 - 1774.16] some
[1770.16 - 1777.16] roofs okay there's some different houses

[1784.48 - 1791.36] some chimney here whatever that's the
[1787.60 - 1794.08] village The Village the innocent
[1791.36 - 1798.88] people okay there it
[1794.08 - 1801.20] is and the manufacturing plant they just
[1798.88 - 1803.16] let out all kinds of stuff out their
[1801.20 - 1806.64] front
[1803.16 - 1807.96] door is what they do they let out lots
[1806.64 - 1811.48] of
[1807.96 - 1814.72] bugs lots of bugs and they do it
[1811.48 - 1818.32] purposely and they time it just right
[1814.72 - 1822.32] okay and these bugs end up going to the
[1818.32 - 1822.32] village and everybody gets
[1822.36 - 1828.84] sick apologize for my my writing
[1826.48 - 1832.68] my artistry
[1828.84 - 1837.12] skills I did not go to art
[1832.68 - 1840.24] school and uh I wish I did I really do
[1837.12 - 1843.52] anyway listen so check this out you guys
[1840.24 - 1848.36] bugs are layered on top of bugs
[1843.52 - 1851.68] purposely so they release them with a
[1848.36 - 1855.32] schedule okay so there's a
[1851.68 - 1856.92] schedule there it is here got all the
[1855.32 - 1858.76] different days of the
[1856.92 - 1860.60] month
[1858.76 - 1863.20] right here's the first here's the second
[1860.60 - 1868.04] here's the third the fourth the fifth
[1863.20 - 1870.76] each month they release one flu bug on
[1868.04 - 1872.36] the first of whatever day of the month
[1870.76 - 1874.88] they want to release it
[1872.36 - 1877.08] on when they know it's gotten out there
[1874.88 - 1878.92] good enough and it's running its course
[1877.08 - 1881.32] they time it and they have schedules and
[1878.92 - 1884.20] they release another one on another
[1881.32 - 1888.24] month maybe they'll release it on the 3D
[1884.20 - 1891.88] okay they layer the manufactured bugs
[1888.24 - 1895.64] purposely so it kicks the crap out of
[1891.88 - 1899.32] people they want you to be
[1895.64 - 1902.04] triggered and injured so you're kept
[1899.32 - 1906.20] down and you feed the system that's how
[1902.04 - 1909.48] it's done see so you catch the one flu
[1906.20 - 1912.44] six weeks ago you catch another flu 3
[1909.48 - 1915.36] weeks ago you catch the stomach flu last
[1912.44 - 1917.56] week it's layered they put them out like
[1915.36 - 1920.64] that and they want everybody in the
[1917.56 - 1926.04] village to get sick everybody and they
[1920.64 - 1928.96] want older people elderly people to die
[1926.04 - 1931.68] correct they want them to die and get
[1928.96 - 1934.80] knocked off that's how it's done they
[1931.68 - 1937.96] want them sick and they want them gone
[1934.80 - 1941.52] that's how the system is set up it's a
[1937.96 - 1941.52] kind of a fun little system isn't
[1942.40 - 1945.53] [Music]
[1946.12 - 1951.44] it they Manu facture the bugs and they
[1949.04 - 1953.56] then they stick the bugs in a
[1951.44 - 1956.64] containment unit with a bunch of white
[1953.56 - 1958.60] mice and they see if the mice all die
[1956.64 - 1961.28] they see if the mice live they see if
[1958.60 - 1964.44] the mice chalk you know cough and choke
[1961.28 - 1968.16] on fleem they see if the mice have
[1964.44 - 1970.64] diarrhea all around the mouse
[1968.16 - 1972.48] tank and then they kind of say well
[1970.64 - 1976.40] we're ready and they eventually let it
[1972.48 - 1979.20] out that's the system that's way it's
[1976.40 - 1981.52] built lady paath over there in IG just
[1979.20 - 1983.32] said I really appreciate how you pointed
[1981.52 - 1985.16] out that most of us have so many
[1983.32 - 1988.40] stresses bringing down our immune
[1985.16 - 1992.56] systems indeed everybody does I am
[1988.40 - 1994.76] included in that I am not immune to that
[1992.56 - 1998.60] I have stress just like anybody else
[1994.76 - 2000.72] plenty of it in fact a lot of it and
[1998.60 - 2002.84] that's what happens when you have the
[2000.72 - 2005.36] most healing stories on the planet of
[2002.84 - 2007.00] people healing you have the most people
[2005.36 - 2010.08] with multiple sceris that got out of
[2007.00 - 2013.08] wheelchairs in
[2010.08 - 2015.28] history the information that's so
[2013.08 - 2017.08] Advanced every single you know somebody
[2015.28 - 2018.76] who somebody in the influencer world is
[2017.08 - 2019.84] stealing and poaching it and using it
[2018.76 - 2021.80] because they can't get their own
[2019.84 - 2023.92] information and all these people are
[2021.80 - 2026.56] healing around the world and it creates
[2023.92 - 2028.04] tremendous amount of stress that's how
[2026.56 - 2030.24] it works you're not allowed to get
[2028.04 - 2031.60] people better in large quantities you're
[2030.24 - 2033.96] allowed to get one or two people better
[2031.60 - 2035.56] and be like hey I got somebody better
[2033.96 - 2037.24] you're not allowed to get millions of
[2035.56 - 2039.00] people better hundreds of thousands of
[2037.24 - 2041.16] people better that weren't supposed to
[2039.00 - 2042.84] get better you're not allowed to do that
[2041.16 - 2046.96] not on planet
[2042.84 - 2046.96] Earth so my stress is
[2047.04 - 2052.44] great chamia says Anthony the flu bug
[2050.08 - 2055.04] got around our household but we were
[2052.44 - 2058.20] able to stop it in its tracks with
[2055.04 - 2061.04] vitamin C shock and zinc shock therapy

[2105.20 - 2108.64] what I've been doing fresh squeezed
[2106.60 - 2112.48] orange juice by the way you guys right

[2145.32 - 2150.08] this right here do you guys know about
[2146.80 - 2151.28] this can I show you this is also a
[2150.08 - 2153.28] collagen
[2151.28 - 2155.52] Builder and the one thing about medical
[2153.28 - 2159.48] medum information is I was the first to
[2155.52 - 2162.40] blow the horn on the BS [ __ ]
[2159.48 - 2164.72] collagen Market where the collagen
[2162.40 - 2167.36] Market was selling all this collagen but
[2164.72 - 2169.12] you can't build collagen eating collagen
[2167.36 - 2173.00] just like you can't fix your eye eating
[2169.12 - 2176.72] an eyeball you can't eat a pig's eyeball
[2173.00 - 2180.12] to fix your eyeball you can't eat a
[2176.72 - 2182.32] liver to fix your liver it doesn't work
[2180.12 - 2185.56] that's not how it works you can't
[2182.32 - 2187.80] rebuild collagen in your body you can't
[2185.56 - 2190.16] rebuild collagen in your body eating
[2187.80 - 2192.28] collagen it's not going to happen so
[2190.16 - 2195.16] medical medium information was the first
[2192.28 - 2198.68] to call that out that you can't get
[2195.16 - 2201.96] better on collagen you can only build
[2198.68 - 2204.16] your collagen with collagen Builders
[2201.96 - 2206.84] that's how you do
[2204.16 - 2207.92] it all right so I got some water heated
[2206.84 - 2209.80] up right
[2207.92 - 2212.24] here I'm going to add a little bit of
[2209.80 - 2215.32] orange juice to this as well this is the
[2212.24 - 2215.32] vitamin C shock
[2215.36 - 2220.08] therapy water got a little toast see
[2218.32 - 2223.44] little bit toastier than I probably
[2220.08 - 2226.12] wanted it so let me get some nice
[2223.44 - 2228.76] cold orange juice in there fresh
[2226.12 - 2232.76] squeezed orange juice look at

[2416.08 - 2420.96] vitamin C right the micro C and let me
[2419.32 - 2424.36] just be clear about this so you guys
[2420.96 - 2427.48] know okay if you're interested this
[2424.36 - 2429.68] isn't ascorbic acid this isn't the thing
[2427.48 - 2431.68] that burns holes in people's
[2429.68 - 2433.72] stomachs that that's what I'm talking
[2431.68 - 2436.24] about that's a different difference with
[2433.72 - 2437.84] vimergy that is the difference right
[2436.24 - 2440.24] there because people don't realize that
[2437.84 - 2441.52] they go and take the ascorbic acid and
[2440.24 - 2443.40] next thing you know they got the runs
[2441.52 - 2445.44] they got diarrhea they got stomach upset
[2443.40 - 2447.36] it's burning their Linings it's burning
[2445.44 - 2449.44] their gut if they're sensitive they had
[2447.36 - 2451.88] ulcers in the past and they're taking
[2449.44 - 2454.64] all that ascorbic acid it's in there
[2451.88 - 2457.56] like sizzling up the ulcers like I I
[2454.64 - 2460.60] can't I can't even go even go there like
[2457.56 - 2463.24] I will never take an ascorbic acid
[2460.60 - 2465.52] straight ascorbic acid vitamin C ever
[2463.24 - 2468.04] again in my life I've taken it when
[2465.52 - 2469.96] there is nothing else available out
[2468.04 - 2472.56] there in the world I've taken it when
[2469.96 - 2475.76] there was nothing available I will never
[2472.56 - 2479.64] ever ever take a Scorpio ass trate to
[2475.76 - 2482.92] Scorpi acid vitamin C ever again ever
[2479.64 - 2484.68] and so I'm just I'm just like I know
[2482.92 - 2487.40] that I'm blessed to know that this is
[2484.68 - 2488.96] out there for me to take personally for
[2487.40 - 2490.52] my health and for people to take
[2488.96 - 2492.04] personally for their health and I'm
[2490.52 - 2494.32] blessed to know that this is actually
[2492.04 - 2496.96] here it's just it's incredible this
[2494.32 - 2498.88] isn't about like supplementation and
[2496.96 - 2501.00] supplements and selling supp this is
[2498.88 - 2503.92] about stuff that literally is critical
[2501.00 - 2507.04] for life like because of what it is and
[2503.92 - 2508.36] what they do it's it's a real Mission
[2507.04 - 2509.84] that's the difference with vimergy and
[2508.36 - 2512.28] then people just trying to Hawk
[2509.84 - 2514.52] supplements grifter H you know selling
[2512.28 - 2516.28] and Hawking supplements because they're
[2514.52 - 2518.44] just trying to make a buck big

[2580.04 - 2583.84] want to I can't help it want to have a
[2582.40 - 2586.20] little real quick here we're talking
[2583.84 - 2590.92] about neov virus we're talking about flu
[2586.20 - 2592.64] we're talking about um C RSV white lung
[2590.92 - 2595.32] but then we're talking about like what
[2592.64 - 2596.40] happens when the scale is tipped so much
[2595.32 - 2598.08] you guys you know how I've been talking
[2596.40 - 2599.72] about the scale tipping all this time
[2598.08 - 2602.48] and and death by a Thousand Cuts for
[2599.72 - 2604.00] like years right and now I just saw like
[2602.48 - 2605.84] someone just said that someone was on a
[2604.00 - 2607.36] podcast like some influencer guy was on
[2605.84 - 2610.12] some podcast doctor or something was on
[2607.36 - 2612.84] a podcast and talking about scale
[2610.12 - 2615.28] tipping Death By A Thousand Cuts I'm
[2612.84 - 2616.20] like dude get your own stuff get your
[2615.28 - 2618.36] own
[2616.20 - 2620.48] stuff but that's what's happening the
[2618.36 - 2623.16] scale's Tipping and that's what these
[2620.48 - 2625.44] bugs do it knocks them down and their
[2623.16 - 2627.96] immune system then struggles their
[2625.44 - 2631.36] immune system is already struggling and
[2627.96 - 2634.00] now they're sick and it's unfair it's
[2631.36 - 2636.76] not right that this happens to people we
[2634.00 - 2640.68] shouldn't have to live our lives sick
[2636.76 - 2643.56] life is short and as it is life is short
[2640.68 - 2646.24] as it is okay we're not living to 500
[2643.56 - 2648.36] years old we're not living to 400 years
[2646.24 - 2653.08] old right it's another story I want to

[2806.76 - 2813.92] total immune is really revolutionary all
[2809.60 - 2815.64] on its own okay it's like with me I I
[2813.92 - 2817.76] know that people need their immune
[2815.64 - 2819.56] system strengthened
[2817.76 - 2823.48] but they need them
[2819.56 - 2827.68] rebuilt rebuilt not just fortified not
[2823.48 - 2830.88] just strengthened not just supported but
[2827.68 - 2832.92] rebuilt because that's the kind of
[2830.88 - 2836.16] immune system trouble so many people are
[2832.92 - 2839.24] in thyroid problems hypo hyper you know
[2836.16 - 2841.68] nodules cysts on the thyroid whether
[2839.24 - 2844.04] they're tiny or large people that deal
[2841.68 - 2846.32] with all kinds of issues under the sun
[2844.04 - 2848.64] everything from neurological problems
[2846.32 - 2851.76] from skin problems our immune systems
[2848.64 - 2855.12] are under attack from everything from
[2851.76 - 2856.72] fragrances and anything people who drink
[2855.12 - 2859.24] alcohol it's another thing did you know
[2856.72 - 2861.92] that it was taboo you guys on another
[2859.24 - 2866.04] note can't help it you know that it was
[2861.92 - 2870.56] taboo to either to utter the word you
[2866.04 - 2872.48] can't do alcohol like it's bad for you
[2870.56 - 2875.84] it's not good for you it's not going to
[2872.48 - 2879.68] help you even all the vegan
[2875.84 - 2882.88] doctors doctors all drink all drink wine
[2879.68 - 2886.52] champagne everything right vodka all
[2882.88 - 2887.92] drink okay and then suddenly now years
[2886.52 - 2890.32] after I've been talking about how bad
[2887.92 - 2891.84] alcohol is and I was getting crap for it
[2890.32 - 2893.84] that was taboo you weren't allowed to
[2891.84 - 2894.96] talk about it on a podcast anywhere you
[2893.84 - 2897.60] weren't allowed to about talk about it
[2894.96 - 2900.16] on social you mentioned that alcohol was
[2897.60 - 2903.16] bad everybody The Gauntlet came down on
[2900.16 - 2905.32] you man they chop off your head I'm not
[2903.16 - 2907.04] kidding but yet I stayed with it stayed
[2905.32 - 2909.80] with it stayed with it talked about
[2907.04 - 2911.72] stayed with it was heavy on it said no
[2909.80 - 2913.56] you can't do this if you want to heal
[2911.72 - 2916.16] you got to get off alcohol it's bad for
[2913.56 - 2918.44] you whatever and then now guess what
[2916.16 - 2920.28] they're all paring it now like yeah
[2918.44 - 2922.12] alcohol is bad for your brain really cuz
[2920.28 - 2923.40] science doesn't say that where did you
[2922.12 - 2926.96] get that
[2923.40 - 2928.16] idea all right look what I like about
[2926.96 - 2931.36] total
[2928.16 - 2933.16] immune okay
[2931.36 - 2936.20] is
[2933.16 - 2939.48] um the fact that it works that's just
[2936.20 - 2942.44] one right off the the bat Mei over there
[2939.48 - 2945.24] on YouTube I noticed that Mayo Clinic
[2942.44 - 2948.44] Now talks about non- rashing shingles no
[2945.24 - 2950.04] mention of the source um there is a
[2948.44 - 2952.24] hijacking of the medical medium non-
[2950.04 - 2956.32] rashing shingles information both there
[2952.24 - 2958.28] at Mayo PubMed wherever all of all of it
[2956.32 - 2959.84] like they've just hijacked medical
[2958.28 - 2962.56] medium information with no science and
[2959.84 - 2965.12] no studies behind it no studies behind
[2962.56 - 2967.60] it and when you look when you look at
[2965.12 - 2969.24] whatever they show check this out how
[2967.60 - 2971.44] sick is this when they look when you
[2969.24 - 2975.44] look at what they show they're talking
[2971.44 - 2976.64] about post herpetic pain when the rash
[2975.44 - 2979.36] goes
[2976.64 - 2982.28] away but they're trying to chalk that up
[2979.36 - 2984.80] as it it's non- rashing shingles no they
[2982.28 - 2986.60] had the rash it went away and then they
[2984.80 - 2988.80] had pain for a year so science of
[2986.60 - 2992.84] research did do a couple of papers where
[2988.80 - 2994.88] you have pain for a year or more after
[2992.84 - 2996.84] shingles but that's not non- rashing
[2994.88 - 2998.80] shingles non- rashing shingles is
[2996.84 - 3001.68] medical medium information it's having
[2998.80 - 3003.84] shingles never a rash ever and having
[3001.68 - 3006.04] symptoms right well now they're claiming
[3003.84 - 3007.64] they knew that when they didn't no signs
[3006.04 - 3009.92] to back it up but mayo and everybody
[3007.64 - 3014.72] else is using medical Mee information on
[3009.92 - 3016.08] that just it's crazy you know what
[3014.72 - 3019.40] there's you know there's good news
[3016.08 - 3022.36] though because they're so evil that when

[3027.24 - 3032.60] you don't work on that you don't come
[3029.88 - 3034.44] clean about like how many people you
[3032.60 - 3036.48] screwed over with chronic illness that
[3034.44 - 3038.00] couldn't get back to the source to heal
[3036.48 - 3040.04] and it's your fault that so many people
[3038.00 - 3042.80] aren't going to heal because you were
[3040.04 - 3045.32] evil and you didn't care and you stole
[3042.80 - 3047.92] that information to just manipulate
[3045.32 - 3050.72] people and then you're on your deathbed
[3047.92 - 3052.84] many years down the road you think
[3050.72 - 3055.32] you're just in the clear with that you
[3052.84 - 3055.32] think you're in the
[3055.64 - 3061.76] clear I say my medicinal home on YouTube
[3059.60 - 3065.52] propolis shock therapy is in the brain
[3061.76 - 3068.48] saver protocol book it helped heal my
[3065.52 - 3069.84] canker source and that's the propolis
[3068.48 - 3071.28] right there I'll give you a close-up on
[3069.84 - 3074.80] the propolis you
[3071.28 - 3079.28] guys I mean honestly look if you look if
[3074.80 - 3081.96] if you can get one thing one thing okay
[3079.28 - 3085.36] you can't you can't lose with total
[3081.96 - 3087.60] immune you can't lose with propolis pure
[3085.36 - 3091.00] if you can get twoo th things it's like
[3087.60 - 3093.92] total immune propolis pure right if you
[3091.00 - 3097.08] can get two things that's how critical
[3093.92 - 3099.80] that is for our immune systems right
[3097.08 - 3100.88] there that's how critical that is all
[3099.80 - 3102.96] right you guys we're talking about all
[3100.88 - 3106.00] kinds of good stuff flu and everything
[3102.96 - 3108.28] else in post flu and post RSV RSV and
[3106.00 - 3110.16] white lung and neuro viruses which are
[3108.28 - 3112.36] going around and we talked about like
[3110.16 - 3114.40] manufacturing they got the manufacturing
[3112.36 - 3116.96] plant right there they're growing the
[3114.40 - 3119.08] viruses spawning them right out of egg
[3116.96 - 3121.72] themselves and then they get released
[3119.08 - 3123.60] magically into our environment and it
[3121.72 - 3125.24] hits the village right here and then
[3123.60 - 3126.28] they calculate it on the calendar of
[3125.24 - 3127.68] when they're going to release the next
[3126.28 - 3129.44] one and next one because they want to
[3127.68 - 3131.32] clobber the crap out of everybody's
[3129.44 - 3135.48] immune system and they want elderly
[3131.32 - 3135.48] people to die early so that's the
[3136.56 - 3141.24] plan and if you don't believe it then
[3138.68 - 3144.36] fine it's all make
[3141.24 - 3146.20] believe sure we can think that maybe
[3144.36 - 3149.32] it's just all make believe and it never
[3146.20 - 3151.48] happened no and that's fine whatever you
[3149.32 - 3153.28] want to think but yeah it's interesting

[3309.48 - 3316.76] supplement my body first and foremost
[3312.92 - 3318.60] right always remember that even if
[3316.76 - 3320.28] you're not sleeping if you're just
[3318.60 - 3321.84] laying there and you're resting your
[3320.28 - 3324.08] nerves and your eyes are shut your
[3321.84 - 3326.84] immune system is recovering just from
[3324.08 - 3328.32] that alone and I want to say this this
[3326.84 - 3330.16] is very important for people who can't
[3328.32 - 3333.56] sleep or can't get enough sleep they're
[3330.16 - 3335.72] working hard everything's off right is
[3333.56 - 3338.04] that when you're even laying there
[3335.72 - 3340.04] you're laying there and you're calm and
[3338.04 - 3342.28] you're shutting your eyes your immune
[3340.04 - 3344.56] system is responding and it's
[3342.28 - 3346.12] reproducing and it's building back up
[3344.56 - 3347.96] even if you're just laying there you
[3346.12 - 3349.76] guys keep that in mind even if you're
[3347.96 - 3351.36] somebody who's struggling with insomnia
[3349.76 - 3353.60] or you have some kind of sleep issue
[3351.36 - 3355.96] your immune system is sitting there
[3353.60 - 3357.52] building and rebuilding up when when
[3355.96 - 3359.84] you're actually just laying there with
[3357.52 - 3363.16] your eyes shut relaxing keep that in
[3359.84 - 3365.32] mind right there okay what I would do if
[3363.16 - 3368.36] I was on your schedule which I am on
[3365.32 - 3370.64] your schedule pretty much I'll work 20
[3368.36 - 3372.12] hour days whatever and I'm on your
[3370.64 - 3373.84] schedule where I'm working all through
[3372.12 - 3379.04] the night too I've done that so many
[3373.84 - 3382.72] times I crank up my micro c i Crank It
[3379.04 - 3386.96] Up that is something I do I crank up the
[3382.72 - 3389.16] the micro c i crank up the B12 these are
[3386.96 - 3392.44] some of the things that I do and then I
[3389.16 - 3395.48] focus on hydration I focus on a little
[3392.44 - 3398.36] bit of coconut water I focus on right my
[3395.48 - 3401.44] celery juice I if I can if I can get it
[3398.36 - 3403.52] done I I focus on that um there's
[3401.44 - 3407.16] there's other things too but and I don't
[3403.52 - 3410.28] eat really heavy meals that's one thing
[3407.16 - 3412.92] right there I don't eat real heavy dense
[3410.28 - 3415.24] meals that are fatty I don't eat big
[3412.92 - 3417.64] fatty meals when I'm
[3415.24 - 3420.08] underslept because that's a recipe right
[3417.64 - 3422.96] there for a heart attack right there
[3420.08 - 3425.36] you're eating heavily ladened fat yeah
[3422.96 - 3426.60] overt fat meals now all the vegans are
[3425.36 - 3428.28] doing over fats that's what they're
[3426.60 - 3430.12] doing they're all doing over it fats all
[3428.28 - 3432.96] the animal protein people they're all
[3430.12 - 3434.20] doing over it fats if you're not if
[3432.96 - 3437.60] you're working really hard and you're
[3434.20 - 3440.28] not sleeping much cranking up over fats
[3437.60 - 3442.56] is like asking for a heart attack I mean
[3440.28 - 3445.16] so then so I make sure that that's not
[3442.56 - 3447.20] happening that's important on its
[3445.16 - 3449.56] own
[3447.20 - 3451.00] yep great information you guys talk
[3449.56 - 3452.68] about rebuilding the immune system a
[3451.00 - 3455.12] little bit couple things you can do

[3510.56 - 3515.44] I've been telling people stay away from
[3512.44 - 3517.20] alkaline water crap that's out there
[3515.44 - 3518.64] I've been how many how many years have I
[3517.20 - 3519.72] told people to stay away from that and
[3518.64 - 3522.24] look what just
[3519.72 - 3524.16] happened I mean it was just terrifying
[3522.24 - 3526.76] which has happened to people out there
[3524.16 - 3528.72] right it's like you know like there's a
[3526.76 - 3531.60] lot of things that I do to keep the
[3528.72 - 3535.20] immune system strong and you know what I
[3531.60 - 3538.08] do is I eat every couple of hours so
[3535.20 - 3539.56] that my dream aren't flooding so if you
[3538.08 - 3541.08] want to keep your immune system strong
[3539.56 - 3543.84] you want to build your immune system
[3541.08 - 3547.12] back up you make sure you're not
[3543.84 - 3548.24] trashing your adrenals get caffeine out
[3547.12 - 3551.60] of
[3548.24 - 3553.20] there get caffeine out that's critical
[3551.60 - 3555.20] by the way there's no science behind
[3553.20 - 3556.72] caffeine hurting the immune system but
[3555.20 - 3558.20] recently I saw something out there of
[3556.72 - 3559.56] somebody like yeah stay away from
[3558.20 - 3561.80] caffeine really because there's no
[3559.56 - 3565.04] science that says it they science says
[3561.80 - 3567.00] caffeine is good for you it's
[3565.04 - 3569.80] crazy
[3567.00 - 3572.60] so how it is the point is is staying
[3569.80 - 3575.16] away from caffeine eating every couple
[3572.60 - 3577.76] of hours don't intermittent
[3575.16 - 3579.72] fast when you want to rebuild your and
[3577.76 - 3582.08] recover your immune system don't do the
[3579.72 - 3584.04] intermittent fasting where you're on
[3582.08 - 3585.68] coffee all day then you eat a big greasy
[3584.04 - 3587.68] fried meal at the end of the night or a
[3585.68 - 3589.76] big overt fat meal at the end of the
[3587.68 - 3592.36] night I'm intermittent fasting my
[3589.76 - 3594.84] stomach staying down I'm not as bloated
[3592.36 - 3597.08] at night I could eat what I want yeah
[3594.84 - 3599.64] you just trash your renals people who
[3597.08 - 3601.92] intermittent fast they seem to improve
[3599.64 - 3605.04] improve but do you hear about like
[3601.92 - 3607.96] things like 5 years later ask them then
[3605.04 - 3609.96] oh yeah um yeah well uh I don't know my
[3607.96 - 3611.48] health has been really gone to [ __ ] um
[3609.96 - 3612.80] all these different things yeah but you
[3611.48 - 3614.00] were on social media talking about how
[3612.80 - 3615.68] you're intermitten and fasting four
[3614.00 - 3617.32] years ago and how great you were doing
[3615.68 - 3619.44] yeah but then I went to carnivore and
[3617.32 - 3621.88] then I got really sick on Carnivore and
[3619.44 - 3623.80] then I tried this and then I tried that
[3621.88 - 3626.08] and I was trying this new program that I
[3623.80 - 3627.52] just purchased for $5,000 from this guy
[3626.08 - 3629.16] says he's a chiropractor or something
[3627.52 - 3631.36] like and then I just did this and did
[3629.16 - 3633.24] that and people are just like they're
[3631.36 - 3636.08] everywhere and it's like Yeah because it
[3633.24 - 3638.12] didn't work intermittent fasting burns
[3636.08 - 3640.28] out the adrenals so what I like to do is
[3638.12 - 3644.28] I like to eat every couple of hours I'll
[3640.28 - 3646.92] have a banana I'll have some oranges
[3644.28 - 3649.20] right I'll eat some
[3646.92 - 3652.48] cucumbers right I'll drink my celery
[3649.20 - 3654.44] juice I'll have a little coconut water
[3652.48 - 3657.04] okay I'll have some fresh squeezed you
[3654.44 - 3659.64] know fresh squeezed orange juice
[3657.04 - 3662.68] okay and then but I'll be eating I'll be
[3659.64 - 3664.76] eating I'll have some dates but I'll be
[3662.68 - 3667.56] eating every couple of hours I'll have
[3664.76 - 3670.16] some greens of some colored greens and
[3667.56 - 3671.64] some dates and I'll just eat them
[3670.16 - 3673.68] together I'll have some kale and some
[3671.64 - 3675.92] dat I'm just saying that this is what I
[3673.68 - 3677.64] do and it's to keep the
[3675.92 - 3679.12] adrenals strong then I'll have some
[3677.64 - 3682.28] steamed potatoes later but it'll keep
[3679.12 - 3684.84] the adrenals strong and it'll also stop
[3682.28 - 3686.48] the adrenals from releasing and that
[3684.84 - 3688.92] lowers the immune system there's so many
[3686.48 - 3692.44] things you can do I mean that's what I
[3688.92 - 3695.36] do right there keeping myself like
[3692.44 - 3697.16] stable so that a I'm not burning the
[3695.36 - 3699.84] gasoline in my body which is your
[3697.16 - 3701.88] adrenaline I'm not burning it all out
[3699.84 - 3704.32] and then I do medical medium recipes
[3701.88 - 3706.56] like medical medium soup recipe with
