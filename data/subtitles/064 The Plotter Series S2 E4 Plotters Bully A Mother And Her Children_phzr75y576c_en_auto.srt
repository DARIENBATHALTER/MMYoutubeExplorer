11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,359
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,519
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,479

Dr Kimberly spare Kim and her husband

81

supported Stephanie at the time of her

82
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,200
illness back in 2020 Ashley posted her

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,920
original false story about Stephanie

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,040
which she made more than 15 false claims

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,680
in one version of and told more than 20

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
falsehoods in another version of

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Kimberly's husband corrected Ashley in

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,360
the comments on something she'd gotten

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,319
very wrong and Ashley had to adjust her

90
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,680
false story because of it Kimberly made

91
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,239
a statement to her own small private

92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,160
Community to calm fears and Chaos that

93
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,639
Ashley had created with her false story

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Ashley was not happy about this and she

95
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,120
responded by attacking Kim and trying to

96
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,520
intimidate her to this day Ashley has

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,199
continued to publicly attack Kimberly

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,520
and and her family Kimberly thank you

99
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,240
for coming on to share your story I know

100
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,600
that the situation has been extremely

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,520
upsetting thank you Amber this is a

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,560
really sad situation a dear friend that

103
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,479
I cared about is being used for an

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,960
agenda that seems to have been created

105
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,880
years after her passing I would have

106
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,400
never shared the intimate details of her

107
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,280
story because Stephanie's privacy is my

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,520
number one concern however the plotters

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
have shared very intimate details of

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,400
Stephanie's story and even delic get

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,680
unnecessary details about her life I was

112
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,919
recently attacked and have been

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,120
continually attacked since 2020 the

114
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,240
attacks were sudden they were out of the

115
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,600
blue I was actually really shocked when

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,840
they began I felt it was really

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,000
necessary for me to set a few things

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,840
straight here

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,199
today yeah could you start Kim by

120
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,000
telling us first about your relationship

121
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,639
with Stephanie and how you were

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,360
supporting her when she was SI

123
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,680
yeah so we met actually at Ashley's home

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,160
during the LA medical medium event

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,280
Stephanie and I became instant friends

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,199
we realized that we lived just one state

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,039
over from each other and that she had a

128
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,479
nephew that was very close and age to my

129
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,880
son we started texting and voice texting

130
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,319
a lot Stephanie was sweet she was funny

131
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,960
she was loving and she was always

132
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,639
looking for advice but she was also

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,199
always offering to help in any way that

134
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,199
she could I would meet up with Stephanie

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,840
for lunch at the grocery store juice

136
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,120
bars and I met up with her the night

137
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,479
that her niece was born at the hospital

138
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
to arm her with the things that she

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,080
wanted to support her sister-in-law

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
through

141
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Labor a few months later I met her

142
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,360
sister-in-law niece and nephew for a

143
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,360
lunch date and we bounced together along

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,800
with her family and my family at her

145
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,240
nephew's birthday party Stephanie was so

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,720
so proud of rise and nephew

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
and wanted me to be friends with her

148
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,520
sister-in-law because she thought we had

149
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
so much in common and we had kids that

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,120
were really close in age I adored

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
Stephanie and the friendship that we

152
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,880
shared I soon became pregnant with my

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,919
second child and Stephanie volunteered

154
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,639
to help me postpartum with my 2-year-old

155
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,000
son the same way that she supported her

156
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,080
sister-in-law and her nephew because she

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,879
told me I helped to support her and her

158
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,240
brother and her brother's family

159
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,120
postpartum and that I also needed that

160
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,599
same help she was always so gentle so

161
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
kind and always questioned how I was

162
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,759
working full-time how I was pregnant and

163
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,120
also caring for a 2-year-old she got it

164
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,280
and it meant so much to

165
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,120
me when Stephanie got sick I remember

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,160
discussing doctors with her and offering

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,400
to go with her into the City and hold

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,280
her hand but Stephanie was not receptive

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,039
to the idea of seeing a doctor at that

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,400
time wow and then what was was happening

171
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,960
and what were things like after

172
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,639
Stephanie got sick so this was really

173
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,360
hard when Stephanie took a turn for the

174
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,280
worst I was getting ready to birth my

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,039
baby I was planning a vack birth as my

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,560
first birth was a traumatic emergency

177
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,720
birth and the stress of what I'm about

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,479
to explain was impacting my ability to

179
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,800
birth my baby I was under so much

180
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,800
pressure and I was having such a hard

181
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,440
time shifting into birth mode as I was

182
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,479
on constant group messages with then

183
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,560
friends colleagues medical doctors

184
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,400
consultants and personally with

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Stephanie to support her as best I could

186
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,800
the pressure was never ever from

187
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,039
Stephanie it was coming from several of

188
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,360
the plotters mostly Ashley who lived

189
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,759
across the country they were looking at

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
a map and telling me that I live an hour

191
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,199
and 20 minutes from Stephanie but in

192
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,199
reality with City traffic this

193
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,599
oftentimes could take up to four hours

194
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,760
each way this is why when Stephanie and

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
I did meet up before she was sick we

196
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,959
were always extremely strategic about

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
our planning the city traffic where we

198
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,479
live is

199
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,279
horrendous and the driving around here

200
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:48,320
during the city traffic it's it's just

201
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,440
crazy so back to my birth I was

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,519
literally in the birthing tub birthing

203
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,080
my baby on text threads with Stephanie

204
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,839
and with her supporters several of which

205
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
are now involved in trying to take this

206
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,560
community down when I finally birthed my

207
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,880
baby I was back on the text threads

208
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,240
within minutes planning how I could best

209
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,399
support Stephanie this was before my

210
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,079
family or my son had even met my new

211
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,120
daughter I was under so much pressure

212
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,279
before I was even cleared to drive by my

213
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,880
midwives I was back on my feet caring

214
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,440
for my newborn caring for my 2-year-old

215
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
and driving food and teas and

216
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,399
supplements that Stephanie wanted to her

217
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,680
whenever I could Stephanie herself did

218
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
not want me doing this but the platters

219
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,800
continued to push me like I was some

220
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,640
type of robot that should birth a baby

221
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,200
and then be back to running around I

222
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,800
also opened up my home to a house guest

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,000
when I was only a few weeks postpartum a

224
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,120
friend Gretchen she came to my house and

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,760
stayed with me so that she could support

226
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,200
Stephanie my husband and I gave up a car

227
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,480
we ran arands on no sleep we also opened

228
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,760
our home to

229
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,839
illness as Gretchen was in and out of

230
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
the hospital and then back in our home

231
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,640
around my newborn we all came down with

232
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,279
a flu when my baby was just a few weeks

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,760
old my two-year-old was also sick it was

234
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,760
one of the hardest experiences of my

235
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,959
life being postpartum having a baby

236
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,600
being exposed to a flu on one trip to

237
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,640
pick up Gretchen again before I was

238
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,839
cleared to drive I was so tired that I

239
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,760
went to pump gas near Stephanie's home

240
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,000
the gas station was old and the pump was

241
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,720
malfunctioning and I was

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,360
exhausted I grabbed the noob nozzle and

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,480
I pressed it a few times before it

244
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,240
turned on soaking me in gasoline my hair

245
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,120
was soaked my clothes were soaked I was

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,480
drenched from head to toe I was sprayed

247
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,639
in the eyes and I felt like I couldn't

248
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,560
breathe I was shaking from the freezing

249
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,680
temperatures my newborn she was in the

250
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,360
back seat breathing in all the

251
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,040
fumes I rushed to Stephanie's house with

252
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,760
my windows down freezing

253
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,440
shaking and I had to shower and wear

254
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,160
someone else's clothes home the whole

255
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,720
time period it was totally

256
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,279
insane I had a baby a baby a newborn

257
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,360
that was just a few weeks old and a

258
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,920
2-year-old son and I was being pushed by

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,279
women across the country mostly at asley

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,360
to do more and more I had already been

261
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,639
supporting Stephanie in every way that I

262
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
could I had given her money I had

263
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,200
purchased supplements that she wanted

264
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,000
and couldn't afford I was cooking her

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
meals when I could bringing her teas

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,959
when I could my husband even took food

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,720
to the hospital at one point just days

268
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,320
after my daughter was

269
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,079
born he felt extremely uncomfortable in

270
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,040
the hospital as Stephanie wanted to talk

271
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,240
to him and welcome the food but he felt

272
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,560
so mixed up in a situation where some of

273
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,839
the plotters were screaming at at her

274
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,880
family one of the platters Taylor was

275
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
attacking Stephanie's father having a

276
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,959
heated discussion while disagreeing with

277
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,760
Stephanie's father about her

278
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,680
treatment my husband during those days

279
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,560
was rushing home from work so that he or

280
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,600
I could run things we could move cars we

281
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,199
could run errands we could manage house

282
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,560
guests cook meals run guests back and

283
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,160
forth with a baby and a two-year-old I

284
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,680
wanted to do everything for

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,000
Stephanie but Ashley was creating a

286
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,920
pressure on that almost broke me during

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,680
that

288
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,959
time

289
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,720
wow there's so much to unpack here from

290
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,399
this story and it sounds like such an

291
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,959
unbelievably stressful and traumatic

292
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,360
time having gasoline sprayed all over

293
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,079
your body like that when your body's

294
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,160
already compromised from having just

295
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,279
given birth let alone when your

296
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,320
breastfeeding it's a

297
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,680
tremendous exposure I can't even imagine

298
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,760
I would have been

299
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,079
devastated and despite having just given

300
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,760
birth you and your husband were both

301
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,399
doing the best that you could to help

302
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,639
Stephanie while she was sick you weren't

303
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,120
cleared to even drive yet and you did it

304
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,920
anyway the drive wasn't short I want to

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,320
bring in a text that we have from

306
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Stephanie she had sent it to a friend

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,720
this was from before she had gotten sick

308
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,639
and she was talking about some items

309
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,920
that she was thinking about picking up

310
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,240
from you and she says okay cool she

311
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,800
isn't super close so may not get it

312
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,160
unless it's super

313
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,240
important this text corroborates this

314
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,959
text from Stephanie corroborates the

315
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,199
fact that you were far enough away from

316
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,560
her that it would have been a hassle for

317
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,360
her to pick up items from your house if

318
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,519
they weren't super

319
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,480
important you said that your husband

320
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,160
brought food to the hospital and spent

321
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,320
time around the family you both were

322
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,399
actually there and you got to witness

323
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,440
what was going on in person when

324
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,279
Stephanie was sick as Ashley mainly was

325
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,240
putting all of this pressure on you to

326
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,440
do more and more I'm wondering where was

327
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Ashley and what was Ashley doing during

328
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,160
the year and a half that Stephanie was

329
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,079
sick I have actually been to Ashley's

330
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,560
family home in Pebble Beach California

331
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:25,480
but at the time I didn't know how well

332
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,720
off she was she was actually in Malibu

333
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,000
while Stephanie was sick she kept saying

334
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,279
she was very far away

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,959
I now wonder why she didn't offer

336
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,959
Stephanie more support or come to see

337
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,720
her she very well had the means to do it

338
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,959
instead Ashley put incredible pressure

339
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,959
on me knowing that I didn't have

340
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,680
postpartum support I didn't have anyone

341
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,519
there helping me supporting me Ashley

342
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,839
and Gretchen were both marketing and

343
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,680
running Retreats during the time of

344
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,480
Stephan's illness and after she passed

345
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,959
the Retreats were out of state and they

346
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,839
had to travel to get to them somehow

347
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,759
Ashley could travel for the Retreats but

348
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,399
she never made it to see

349
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,440
Stephanie yeah so while Ashley was busy

350
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,959
running Retreats with Gretchen in Hawaii

351
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
and trying to make money off of the

352
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,079
medical medium Community she was bossing

353
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,120
you around and putting pressure on you

354
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,000
to help even more than you already were

355
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
you and your husband were there with

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,040
Stephanie and you showed up to help but

357
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Ashley on the other hand we now know

358
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,959
that Ashley wasn't physically present

359
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,240
for any part of Stephanie's breast lump

360
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,480
Discovery she wasn't around for any part

361
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,600
of Stephanie's back injury she didn't

362
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,600
visit Stephanie in the hospital

363
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,360
once as we covered earlier on in these

364
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,959
podcasts Ashley the daughter of a

365
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,279
billionaire family with a private jet

366
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,240
was on a private jet headed to

367
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:56,240
Pennsylvania where Stephanie was just a

368
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,199
few months before Stephanie died and

369
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,560
Ashley still didn't visit her

370
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,360
yeah I know that Stephanie's family

371
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,240
didn't even like Ashley or any of the

372
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,639
plotters at the time they didn't like

373
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,480
the way that she lived they didn't like

374
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,800
the way that Steph ate which by the way

375
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,120
wasn't exactly medical median she did so

376
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,160
many

377
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:24,120
things so the family didn't like Ashley

378
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Ashley wasn't around at all and somehow

379
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,040
for some reason Ashley has tried to

380
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,600
position herself as an authority on

381
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,519
Stephanie I want to bring us back to

382
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,480
when Ashley posted her original false

383
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,720
story online in

384
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,120
2020 Ashley made more than 15 false

385
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,040
claims in one version and more than 20

386
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,120
false claims in another version your

387
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,440
husband however having firsthand

388
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,480
knowledge of what had occurred corrected

389
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,560
Ashley in the comments of one of her

390
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,800
posts he said but you're missing the

391
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,120
critical part when Anthony at Medical

392
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,160
medium told told her she needed to see a

393
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,640
doctor and have the lump dealt with oh I

394
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,880
forgot that doesn't fit your

395
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,640
agenda Ashley replied to this by

396
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,079
saying Anthony didn't tell her to see a

397
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,520
doctor until she was bleeding from her

398
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,919
nipples the same point at which he

399
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,360
stopped communicating with

400
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,799
her at this point in the plotter podcast

401
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,520
series we all know that this is far from

402
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,280
the truth to this your husband responded

403
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,440
by saying I don't know the whole story

404
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,440
nor claim to but if you are going to

405
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,640
claim the truth needs to be out there at

406
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,039
least do such a thing in its entirety

407
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,000
the above is one case in point which you

408
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,240
just acknowledge you skipped over and

409
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,919
I'm sure there are others kind of

410
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,760
calling the kettle black when you want

411
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,240
to make allegations of people being

412
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,480
Liars your husband called Ashley out for

413
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,320
being inaccurate and falsely narrating

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,400
the story the way that it served her

415
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,200
agenda even people people who didn't

416
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,080
know what happened with Stephanie found

417
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,039
Ashley's story to be alarmingly

418
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,919
inconsistent with what they know of

419
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,840
Anthony and medical medium information

420
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,760
one person commented and said doesn't he

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,480
always say to see a doctor and see what

422
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,840
the diagnosis is and go from

423
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,960
there another person added I listen to

424
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,039
Anthony's podcasts and have never heard

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,000
him suggest not to see a doctor

426
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,880
conventional or otherwise I find it hard

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,840
to believe your claim that Anthony

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,799
explicitly told her not to see a

429
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,280
doctor after all of the push back and

430
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,440
being corrected by your husband Ashley

431
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,600
commented this I tried to add it to my

432
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,120
post but Instagram won't let me but if

433
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,880
IG will allow me later I will add

434
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,880
it initially Ashley left out any mention

435
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,640
of any doctors being involved then here

436
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,520
because of your husband's correction and

437
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,400
the push back she was getting she

438
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,880
changed her story and went on from there

439
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,799
to say Anthony told Stephanie to see a

440
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,600
doctor but not until it was too late

441
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:11,240
which is still very far from the truth

442
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,320
and with all of her blatant false claims

443
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,280
Ashley caused a lot of damage one

444
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,200
comment on this post read he should have

445
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,039
told her to see a doctor the moment she

446
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,240
found the lump and told him it should be

447
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,480
a lesson for him and any healer I've

448
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,280
heard similar stories many times with

449
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,480
other healers I'm just so so sorry again

450
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,600
to hear this we hope that this person

451
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,880
has now listened to our podcasts to

452
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,360
learn the truth even though they

453
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,640
probably didn't because they're probably

454
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,679
long gone since being scared by Ashley's

455
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,559
false claims if they have been listening

456
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,720
they would have learned that this is

457
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,840
exactly in fact what Anthony did exactly

458
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,240
one day after Stephanie reached out

459
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,200
about her breast lump Discovery Anthony

460
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,840
and his wife texted that you should

461
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,240
always c a

462
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,720
physician even after being corrected by

463
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,559
your husband Ashley continued on with

464
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,039
more falsities she commented this he

465
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,600
told her to see a doctor when it was too

466
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,400
late for them to do anything and when he

467
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,840
clearly realized he had screwed up it

468
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,559
was at this point that he also cut off

469
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,200
communication with her it doesn't feel

470
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,799
very relevant to me that after years of

471
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,720
telling her not to see a doctor and that

472
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,480
she would be fine he changed his tune

473
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,120
when she was incredibly ill there are so

474
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,559
many false things in here it's

475
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,400
disturbing not a single sentence is

476
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,799
accurate as we've covered Anthony told

477
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,120
Stephanie to see a doctor from the very

478
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,960
beginning he didn't screw up Anthony was

479
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,880
consistent in his messaging to Stephanie

480
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,000
all throughout the time of her illness

481
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,000
that doctors should be involved he never

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,360
changed his tune and Anthony was not the

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,320
one who cut off communication with

484
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,400
Stephanie we'll get to that more in a

485
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:10,080
bit but my gosh Kim no wonder you had to

486
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,000
make a statement I mean can you just

487
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,000
describe for us what was going on in the

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,520
community at the time after she did this

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,320
I know that many people had reached out

490
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,320
to me and I know that many people were

491
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,679
reaching out to you too what was the

492
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,000
impression that they had gotten from

493
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,400
Ashley's post Ashley compared Stephanie

494
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,400
to her own father who she said did

495
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,039
everything his fancy doctors told him to

496
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,520
do but summarized that none of them

497
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,360
actually had any idea what they were

498
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,640
doing she said her dad did everything

499
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,919
the conventional doctors told him to do

500
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,240
and he died Stephanie also followed

501
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,320
conventional treatment yet Ashley

502
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,080
insinuated that Stephanie followed a

503
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,400
protocol designed by Anthony and died

504
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,320
this isn't true Stephanie received

505
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,279
conventional

506
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,880
treatment as for the community it was a

507
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,559
mess it became so divided the fear was

508
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,799
unbelievable what Ashley did was instill

509
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,720
fear in so many people it was like they

510
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,320
started thinking their spinach salad or

511
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,960
their spinach soup was harming them and

512
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,120
they went back to a standard American

513
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,960
diet or went back to eating

514
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,679
McDonald's it's horrifying and it's all

515
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,200
so far from the truth all based on

516
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,120
complete completely false claims I've

517
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,679
seen from the data that Stephanie

518
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,760
received conventional cancer treatment

519
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,919
for almost a year here and because you

520
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,480
unlike Ashley were directly involved

521
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,120
with Stephanie's situation you were

522
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,559
there in person you had the ability to

523
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,159
set the record straight so you and

524
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,400
another practitioner who was also

525
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,279
directly involved sent letters out to

526
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,640
each of your private communities I

527
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,600
remember those letters I remember the

528
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,400
volatile situation that Ashley had

529
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,200
created with her

530
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,120
disinformation you and the other

531
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,159
practitioner handled this with a

532
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,640
tremendous amount of care care Grace and

533
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,640
a lot of respect while protecting

534
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,679
Stephanie and her private information

535
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,799
after Ashley had exploited her to serve

536
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,240
her own

537
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,080
agenda I have your letter in front of me

538
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,200
and here are some of the critical

539
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,919
clarifications that you

540
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,480
made Stephanie was not under Anthony's

541
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,799
care for

542
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,600
cancer Anthony did not provide

543
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,799
supplementation or food protocols for

544
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,120
her Cancer all cancer related medical

545
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,120
decisions were being made by Stephanie's

546
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,240
family and a few close

547
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,559
friends Stephanie received chemotherapy

548
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,000
and many other conventional Medical

549
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:45,440
Treatments you also shared in here about

550
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,440
how devastating it was for you to have

551
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,320
lost a friend and about how unhappy you

552
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,520
knew it would make Stephanie that

553
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,559
Anthony was being inaccurately blamed

554
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,240
for such a terrible

555
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,480
tragedy you had every right to send this

556
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,760
letter letter you had every right to

557
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,840
make those

558
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,679
clarifications and we now know those

559
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,520
clarifications to be true as proven by

560
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,120
the evidence that has been presented in

561
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,760
these podcast

562
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,440
episodes but Ashley obviously didn't

563
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,640
like that so can you explain what

564
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,799
happened after these letters were sent

565
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,039
out yeah Ashley started attacking me on

566
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,880
texts on audio messages while I was

567
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,440
driving in the pouring rain and then she

568
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,520
took the letters we sent to a very small

569
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,399
private

570
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,600
Community these were not public

571
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:36,760
communities and she made a retaliation

572
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,200
post posting these letters publicly and

573
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,960
then calling me and the other

574
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,600
practitioner

575
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:47,000
Liars okay so let's unpack that in the

576
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,000
retaliation post Ashley made she said

577
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,640
this some women I know were really upset

578
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,240
by my post they knew Stu personally

579
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,559
though I wouldn't call them good friends

580
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,000
of

581
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,679
hers though we've got a false claim

582
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,480
right at the beginning now I think that

583
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,559
Ashley tried to Discount your friendship

584
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,440
with Stephanie to make you appear less

585
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:13,360
credible Ashley also did an Instagram

586
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,080
live on April 1st of 2020 in which she

587
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,919
took it even

588
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,919
further

589
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,840
um what about the response of other

590
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,159
practitioners defending him and putting

591
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:30,320
others

592
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:30,320
down man that's so hard to talk about um

593
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I mean first of all they called

594
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,000
themselves Steph's friends which was

595
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,960
really hard because they were not her

596
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,279
friends like they knew her they weren't

597
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,360
friends with

598
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:46,039
her

599
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,120
um it's it was amazing to me frankly if

600
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm being totally honest it was like it

601
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:55,159
was kind of just shocking and for them

602
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,799
to see and walk through that experience

603
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,559
um the only thing I keep coming back to

604
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:04,640
is they didn't know stuff that

605
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,600
well so here she went as far as to say

606
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,440
publicly that you and the other

607
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,159
practitioner weren't friends with

608
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,799
Stephanie at

609
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,200
all I know that this is false first of

610
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,320
all because Ashley told me the exact

611
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,320
opposite on the phone several months ago

612
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,440
as a reminder to everyone I recorded

613
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,760
that call and it appeared in our podcast

614
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,320
episodes in previous episodes and just

615
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,720
so everyone also knows and understand

616
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,360
stands that recording was completely

617
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,399
legal Ashley has made false claims about

618
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,080
that as well but here is what Ashley

619
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:43,399
told me in that call and I said this to

620
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,240
Kimberly then and I Kimberly is the only

621
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,840
person I really lost my temper with

622
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,960
because I felt like she was Steph's

623
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,520
friend and she saw what

624
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,960
happened Ashley said to me privately on

625
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,480
the phone that you were Stephanie's

626
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,840
friend and that you saw what happened

627
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,720
why is this the opposite of what Ashley

628
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,640
shared in her 2020 blog post because it

629
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,240
sounds to me like she was trying to

630
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,159
deceive the public in Ashley's live she

631
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,240
also told this

632
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,640
falsity they weren't there at the

633
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,640
beginning of her journey they kind of

634
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,559
came in at the very end when Anthony

635
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,960
ghosted this one is even more ridiculous

636
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,480
I've seen from all the text records that

637
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,600
the other practitioner ashle is

638
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,399
referring to became friends with and

639
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,000
started texting with Stephanie in June

640
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,520
of 2016 a year before Stephanie's health

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,080
really took a turn and you met Stephanie

642
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,600
at the live event in 2016 and became

643
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,039
friends with her at that point as well

644
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,200
I've seen so much evidence of both of

645
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,600
you having been there for her and

646
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,279
offering your support to Stephanie early

647
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,039
on in her illness Journey as we've

648
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,000
talked about before Ashley loves to say

649
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,679
that Anthony ghosted Stephanie to get

650
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,200
people riled up it's a tactic but it's

651
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,600
completely false Stephanie's family cut

652
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,919
off communication between them and told

653
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,760
Anthony in a very aggressive way to stay

654
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,240
away so Ashley made plenty of false

655
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,039
claims here yeah so Stephanie sent me

656
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
hundreds of voice notes many of them

657
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:21,919
were a long voice notes that's the kind

658
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,120
of relationship I had with Steph I got

659
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,600
many times the daily update from her I

660
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,559
knew what she did from the moment she

661
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
woke up she would take me through her

662
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,080
morning morning morning routine and how

663
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,559
she spent many of her days her messages

664
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,600
were personal like really really

665
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,760
personal they were family they were

666
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,720
about friendships she asked for help

667
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,960
supporting the ones that she loved she

668
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,600
always asked for advice I know the very

669
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,080
intimate details of some of the closest

670
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,799
family members to her she shared it all

671
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,360
she offered to stay in my home when I

672
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:58,440
was postpartum to care for my son and to

673
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,519
care for me the way that she did for her

674
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,200
own nephew I don't think you share that

675
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,480
much and offer so much with someone who

676
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,240
is not your

677
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,600
friend yeah it sounds like the two of

678
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,519
you were close friends to me we also

679
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,640
know that Ashley's claims are false

680
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,240
because we have audios that Stephanie

681
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,880
had sent to a friend talking about how

682
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,000
close she was with you Gretchen and Kim

683
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,039
just become good friends really sweet

684
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,039
women and really

685
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,880
people and about trips she had taken

686
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,120
with you tomorrow I'm actually going

687
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:42,120
away with um Kim you know Kim really

688
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,559
spare Anda SEC cor because she's in

689
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,799
Pennsylvania right now remember I told

690
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,399
you about that we're just going to go

691
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,640
for like a couple days and spend some

692
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,120
time with her and then again in a couple

693
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,600
weeks I'm going to go up again for a few

694
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,039
days we also have a text that Stephanie

695
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,480
had sent to a friend about you that

696
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,640
reads she lives by my brother which is

697
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,279
convenient I introduced her to my

698
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,039
sis-in-law and fam and they have become

699
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,960
friends as well so that's been

700
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,200
nice and we have a long audio from

701
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,440
Stephanie talking about how you were

702
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,760
there for part of her back injury which

703
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,440
was months and months before Anthony was

704
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,760
told by Stephanie's family to stay

705
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,080
away hi well I hurt my back in the

706
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,640
beginning of

707
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,200
June I you know I hadn't been doing yoga

708
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,799
for a while or Pilates and I ended up

709
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,240
just by fluke coincidence I ended up

710
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,360
doing them both in the same week and by

711
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,279
the end of that week my lower back felt

712
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,799
kind of

713
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,480
weird

714
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,240
um weird enough where I literally it was

715
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,840
hurting to go on the rebounder so I kind

716
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,240
of had to stop that uh and then I went

717
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,039
to the caropractor and everything was

718
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,720
better like a day later but I only

719
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,399
waited like a few days to start

720
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,159
exercising again you know I started like

721
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:02,440
light I just went on the rebounder for

722
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:05,039
the first couple days and walked and did

723
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,960
pocket gym but then after a few days I

724
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,600
was back into yoga fully and I was like

725
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,880
doing yoga every day and pilates every

726
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,639
day or almost every day

727
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,080
um and I was just feeling so good and I

728
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:19,000
just like wanted to do all these things

729
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,399
and it was so stupid on hindsight I'm

730
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,960
like what am I thinking you know we know

731
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,440
better than to do that um just too much

732
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,240
at once like that especially since I

733
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,039
hadn't been doing it I mean I felt fine

734
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,480
doing it I felt I got right back into it

735
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,000
I was doing like intense stuff and it

736
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,720
was like great but clearly my body

737
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,200
wasn't right ready there and so I went

738
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,880
to the chiropractor again but then it

739
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,440
never it got a little bit better but

740
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,000
then I was carrying all these heavy

741
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,200
watermelons which were killing me but

742
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,880
like I was hanging out with scretchen

743
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,240
and Kim and like when I went up there I

744
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,039
just brought all these watermelons ex

745
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,960
seeed huge watermelons

746
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,760
and it just from there it got worse and

747
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,120
worse and I was with Gretchen for like

748
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,200
almost a week when I came home at the

749
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,159
beginning of I as I came home the Fourth

750
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,639
of July it got it was like horrendous

751
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,480
like it got really bad

752
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:10,240
excruciating like super super bad like

753
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,360
crazy spasming and nerves like shooting

754
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,440
pains like and literally I've been home

755
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,399
doing nothing for the whole month of

756
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,080
July all of that goes to show that you

757
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,240
were around and there to see a lot of

758
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,919
what happened including that Stephanie

759
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,240
injured her back by doing all of the

760
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:32,639
physical things she just described which

761
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,600
again proves Ashley's original false

762
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:39,159
storyline wrong in which Ashley had said

763
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,720
this on March 7th of 2020 about

764
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,240
Stephanie in the spring of

765
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,799
2017 her back began to eche we talked a

766
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,159
little bit during her back injury she

767
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,960
told me Anthony said it was a yoga

768
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,720
injury I really don't remember hurting

769
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,200
it in yoga she

770
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,200
said Ashley claimed that Stephanie had

771
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,919
said she didn't remember hurting back in

772
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,159
yoga but we have several audios from

773
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,080
Stephanie like the one we just played in

774
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
which Stephanie explains to various

775
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,279
different people all about how she

776
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,399
injured her back doing yoga and pilates

777
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,679
so obviously Stephanie was aware and

778
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,000
remembered because as we covered

779
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,480
previously Anthony didn't tell Stephanie

780
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,360
that her back problems were due to a

781
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,919
yoga injury Stephanie told people that

782
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,399
she had injured her back doing yoga and

783
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,279
pilates

784
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,240
and then she was doing things like

785
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,880
carrying heavy watermelons with an

786
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,080
already injured back that you witnessed

787
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,679
which made things

788
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,039
worse so now I just want to bring it

789
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:45,760
back to Ashley's retaliation post once

790
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:48,919
more again she had said this some women

791
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,519
I know were really upset by my post they

792
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,240
knew Stu personally though I wouldn't

793
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,639
call them good friends of

794
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,480
hers and Ashley's April 1st 2021 live in

795
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:03,440
which she said

796
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,600
this

797
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,399
um I mean first of all they called

798
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,919
themselves Steph's friends which was

799
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,800
really hard because they were not her

800
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,599
friends like they knew her they weren't

801
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,079
friends with

802
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,480
her we've shown that you Kim were indeed

803
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,399
a good friend of Stephanie's we also

804
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,320
have text and audio messages showing

805
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,839
that the other practitioner Ashley was

806
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,960
referring to was also in fact that a

807
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,919
good friend of

808
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,679
Stephanie's on June 29th of 2016

809
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,599
Stephanie texted the

810
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,480
practitioner you're so sweet I love you

811
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,000
dear

812
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,960
friend in a text from November 11th of

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,639
2016 Stephanie says to her I love you

814
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,119
dearly in a text from December 29th of

815
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:57,160
2016 Stephanie said to her hey sweet

816
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,440
friend in a text from July 8th of 2016

817
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,520
Stephanie said to her it's also

818
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,320
validating when sharing with a trusted

819
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,280
friend and we have audios from Stephanie

820
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,560
discussing how much this practitioner

821
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,960
had helped Stephanie Stephanie's

822
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,880
sister-in-law and Stephanie's brother

823
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,280
who is now a plotter trying to take down

824
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,560
the medical medium Community during an

825
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,800
extremely troubling time for them Tony

826
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,240
and Megan my brother's Tony his wife

827
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,560

birth I'm here supporting them you know

830
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,359
intense there's a lot of stuff that was

831
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,480
going on to the hospital thank God man

always so supportive and there for me

835
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,760
the whole time and anything we needed

836
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,680
and supporting tun and

837
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,119
Megan there are hundreds and hundreds of

838
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,119
text messages that I've read going back

839
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,560
and forth between Stephanie and this

840
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,920
practitioner mostly of Stephanie asking

841
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,880
the practitioner for advice the

842
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,119
practitioner also helped Stephanie's

843
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,000
family in a very significant way during

844
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,520
a very dark time for them Stephanie

845
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,119
regularly expressed tremendous gratitude

846
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,640
for the positive impact this

847
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,160
practitioner had in her life and in

848
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,640
her's

849
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,119
lives we've got all of this evidence of

850
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,520
Stephanie calling this practitioner a

851
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,400
dear friend referring to you Kim

852
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,839
specifically as a good friend and

853
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,160
talking about all the time that you had

854
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,160
spent together including during the time

855
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,240
of Stephanie's back injury clearly this

856
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,680
practition and you were both very

857
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,400
important people in Stephanie's life and

858
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,200
Ashley told another big falsity to the

859
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,400
public I was even invited to Stephanie's

860
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,560
celebration of life I was around when

861
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,359
Stephanie injured her back I remember

862
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,319
her jumping on that trampoline with her

863
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,160
injury I supported Stephanie and met up

864
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:53,160
with her at the hospital the night that

865
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,880
her niece was born it's a strange thing

866
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,440
strange thing to have to qualify a

867
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,040
friendship but what Ashley said was so

868
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,760
hurtful because Stephanie was someone

869
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,280
that I really cared

870
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,800
about yeah I'm sure it was really

871
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,520
hurtful and it's a very it's a very um

872
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,520
it's a low blow it was very low for her

873
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,040
to go there and so following the false

874
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,920
friendship claims Ashley's retaliation

875
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,119
post continued on to say this these two

876
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,800
women sent out letters about my post to

877
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,319
their entire communities they

878
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,160
essentially made it seem like I was

879
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,800
lying this was a really impactful

880
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,880
experience for me because something I've

881
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,640
never realized before is just how much

882
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,920
you can use facts and distort them to

883
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,680
create what's actually a lie and there's

884
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,079
nothing I hate more than

885
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,720
lying so Ashley is saying that what you

886
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,920
shared was

887
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,040
factual but she's still calling you a

888
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,880
liar and the irony of all

889
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,520
is that she's calling you a liar in a

890
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,040
post that she Ashley herself told more

891
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,640
than 15 false claims in one version of

892
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,760
and more than 20 in another version of

893
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,319
Kim how frustrating was it for you to

894
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,800
watch Ashley do this

895
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:22,560
publicly it has been so heartbreaking

896
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,119
it's been extremely traumatizing for me

897
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,800
for my family the amount of stress that

898
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,160
Ashley has created with their false

899
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,760
stories is just

900
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,319
unbelievable

901
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,800
yeah and sadly she didn't stop there

902
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,200
Ashley tried calling you while you were

903
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,200
driving in the pouring rain and because

904
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,000
you didn't answer Ashley sent you a

905
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,359
barrage of text messages and I want to

906
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,920
walk us through that

907
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,920
conversation in the very first text

908
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,040
Ashley tries to rewrite history by

909
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,280
retelling her false version of what had

910
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,520
happened with Stephanie she tried to

911
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,480
sell this narrative to you Kim when you

912
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,000
were actually there there for Stephanie

913
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,760
and witnessing things that had happened

914
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,760
firsthand in person and Ashley was

915
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:13,640
not the text says this hey girl I just

916
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,720
can't not say something to you Steph was

917
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,079
personally Guided by Anthony for years

918
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,880
she did every single thing he ever told

919
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,319
her to do she laid on her back for

920
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,800
months while her spine literally

921
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:29,119
crumbled because he told her she had a

922
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,240
yoga in iny that later he ended up

923
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,359
staying with shingles and then when she

924
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,920
started bleeding from her nipples after

925
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:41,760
telling her she would never have cancer

926
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,640
his response to cut her off completely

927
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,160
and never speak to her again up to days

928
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,640
before Steph died she was texting

929
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,720
Anthony begging him just to talk to her

930
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,359
for you to write that letter and

931
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,359
knowingly mislead people about their

932
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,319
relationship is so Absol disgusting to

933
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:06,079
me and just frankly

934
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:09,920
unimaginable this text has six false

935
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,160
things in it six critical things that

936
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,359
are completely wrong and it seems as

937
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,720
though Ashley thinks if she just repeats

938
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,319
them enough she'll be able to get

939
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,720
everyone to just go along with it I'm

940
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:24,480
going to walk us through the false

941
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,880
Claims One Stephanie did not do

942
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,880
everything Anthony ever told her to do

943
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,480
Anthony consistent message from the

944
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
beginning was that Stephanie should see

945
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,480
a doctor for her breast lump and

946
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,359
Stephanie made the decision to wait too

947
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,240
long to follow that

948
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,359
advice two Stephanie did not lay on her

949
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,480
back for months because Anthony told her

950
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,400
she had an

951
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,440
injury three Stephanie got stuck laying

952
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,720
on her back because Stephanie said

953
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,520
herself she had injured her back doing

954
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,079
yoga and lates and it was made worse by

955
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,040
Stephanie carrying heavy watermelons and

956
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,599
jumping on the trampoline

957
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,440
which you were actually around to see

958
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,920
Stephanie got stuck laying on her back

959
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,240
because her doctor diagnosed her with a

960
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,400
dis injury and because she was on a

961
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,680
small old childhood mattress on the

962
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,400
floor that was terrible for her back and

963
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,079
made it too difficult for her to get up

964
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,760
four Stephanie did not bleed from both

965
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:24,040
nipples she only bled from one and five

966
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,560
Anthony never ever told Stephanie that

967
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,280
she would never have

968
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,880
cancer and sck

969
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,960
Anthony did not cut Stephanie off

970
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,119
Stephanie's family told Anthony to stay

971
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,800
away Stephanie did not text Anthony

972
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,200
begging him to talk to

973
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,560
her Ashley was so wrong about all of it

974
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,319
from the beginning and yet she continued

975
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,680
to berate you Kim for the factual letter

976
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,280
you had sent out to your small private

977
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,480
Community further text messages in this

978
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,640
thread from Ashley to you said this she

979
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,800
found a lump in her breast 3 years

980
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,800
before she died and he told her it would

981
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,599
never be cancerous does that bother you

982
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,240
at all does it like hello is this hiding

983
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:15,680
home I get that you weren't there when

984
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,480
that happened but I was does that I mean

985
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,599
come

986
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,280
on that series of texts from Ashley is

987
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,960
not only incredibly condescending but

988
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,880
also has three more false things in it

989
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,400
the the first one Stephanie did not

990
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,240
discover her breast lump when she was

991
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,040
living with Ashley in

992
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,000
2016 Stephanie in fact discovered the

993
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,000
lump a year later when Ashley was not

994
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,200
around the second false thing Anthony

995
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,839
never told Stephanie that the lump would

996
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,480
never become cancerous he repeatedly

997
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:52,160
encouraged her to get it looked at by a

998
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,720
physician and here Ashley's putting you

999
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,599
down by claiming that she was around

1000
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,520
when you were not which is the ex exact

1001
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,599
opposite of the truth that's the third

1002
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,160
falsehood our data shows that Ashley

1003
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,839
wasn't around for any single part of

1004
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,079
Stephanie's experience with her breast

1005
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:15,680
lump her back injury her cancer or her

1006
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,760
passing and yet you were physically

1007
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,760
there helping Stephanie as much as you

1008
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,839
could after just having a baby during

1009
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,800
Stephanie's

1010
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:26,680
illness you responded to Ashley by

1011
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,160
saying in all caps I'm driving in the

1012
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,400
pouring

1013
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,839
rain which sounds to me like you were

1014
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,000
begging her to stop attacking you and

1015
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:37,640
then Ashley replied to you by saying

1016
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,960
this I'm not there to see it so maybe

1017
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,520
it's not actually

1018
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,520
happening later

1019
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,240
Kim and then she sends three ey roll

1020
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,000
emojis what Ashley is again

1021
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,880
condescendingly implying to you is that

1022
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,480
you don't believe in Ashley's story

1023
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,680
which we know is

1024
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,400
false she's saying it's because you

1025
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,839
weren't there to see it and that's why

1026
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,960
you don't believe her Ashley is saying

1027
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:11,559
that Ashley was there to see it and you

1028
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,359
weren't but in reality it's the exact

1029
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:18,839
opposite the real truth is that you were

1030
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:19,680
there and Ashley wasn't the truth you

1031
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,040
were

1032
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,720
there Ashley wasn't if Ashley wants to

1033
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,640
play the comparison game and use

1034
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,200
physical proximity as a measure of

1035
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,640
someone's authority to speak on

1036
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,720
Stephanie then in reality based on facts

1037
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,839
Ashley loses at her own

1038
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,000
game however Ashley ends up going on to

1039
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,400
say this to you I know that you can see

1040
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,760
what you did I know

1041
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,319
it I don't know how you can live with it

1042
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:54,040
but I know you can see it and I hope it

1043
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,040
haunts you bye

1044
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,160
Kim and then you replied by saying

1045
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,760
saying no Ash we all tried to help with

1046
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,240
all we had when it was going on I know

1047
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,760
you don't realize that but it's the

1048
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,480
truth I was barely paying my own bills

1049
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,160
and was buying her supplements at one

1050
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,119
point and doing everything I could with

1051
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,920
a brand new baby nobody saw that make me

1052
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,520
a monster

1053
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,800
though and then Ashley sent you some

1054
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,040
voice messages that we're going to play

1055
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,000
now Kim I don't think that you're a

1056
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,480
monster I think that what you did in

1057
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
your letter is you isolate facts and you

1058
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,680
painted an untrue picture of what

1059
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,160
happened it's just not

1060
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:41,040
true for you to use the facts that you

1061
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,520
do have and manipulate them in such a

1062
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,280
way I just I mean come

1063
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,280
on and honestly I don't even care about

1064
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,839
all the people that it impacted because

1065
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
they will have their chance to hear the

1066
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,200
truth I can't even call it lying because

1067
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,960
of the way that you used facts but you

1068
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:04,760
used them so articulately to distort the

1069
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,400
truth that it ended up being a lie and I

1070
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,400
hate that I can't stand

1071
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:17,400
liars wow wow just unre

1072
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,800
wow first of

1073
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,359
all I want to oh

1074
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,960
sorry it still gives me Goose Goosebumps

1075
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,800
hearing that

1076
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,200
yeah yeah yeah

1077
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,480
yeah I can imagine it's she first of all

1078
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,240
I want to point out that Ashley said

1079
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,920
here that she doesn't care about all the

1080
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
people who her post impacted because

1081
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,480
she's saying that they will have their

1082
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,400
chance to hear the truth in fact the

1083
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,079
people Ashley impacted with her false

1084
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,960
2020 posts didn't get a chance to hear

1085
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,880
the truth before these

1086
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,200
podcasts if they're even still around

1087
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,559
and listening Ashley has impacted many

1088
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,200
people and hurt many people with her

1089
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,599
disinformation secondly Ashley's being

1090
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,400
incredibly manipulative in these

1091
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,000
messages she's twisted everything around

1092
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,079
so much it's actually scary she's

1093
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,400
attacking you relentlessly while you're

1094
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,800
driving in the pouring rain her

1095
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,359
information is all wrong she wasn't

1096
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,920
actually there and you were yet she's

1097
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,880
putting you down demeaning you and

1098
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,079
admitting that you used facts so she can

1099
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,040
actually call it lying but at the same

1100
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,240
time she's calling you a liar with all

1101
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:32,079
those falsities in her text at the same

1102
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,480
time how did it feel to have a grown

1103
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,880
woman act like this and treat you like

1104
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,480
this honestly Amber I have PTSD from

1105
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,240
what Ashley did to me that night I was

1106
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,880
driving to my sister-in-law's wedding

1107
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,920
festivities I was alone it was dark it

1108
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,559
was pouring down rain Ashley would not

1109
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,800
stop she wouldn't stop I had to call my

1110
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,960
husband on the phone because I was

1111
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,359
shaking at the time I was doing my best

1112
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,800
to protect Stephanie's privacy and to

1113
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:06,480
not let her be exploited by Ashley it's

1114
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,599
really sad that Ashley has taken it this

1115
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,640
far I've now been attacked personally

1116
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,480
professionally my family has been

1117
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,240
attacked Ashley is actually the most

1118
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,240
intimidating person I've ever

1119
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:23,640
met yeah I'm so sorry Kim that you've

1120
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,359
had to go through all that and it's

1121
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:30,040
really not okay that she's that she

1122
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:32,359
attacked like this and it's really Brave

1123
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,559
of you to come on here and talk about it

1124
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,440
because I'm sure that everything were

1125
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,559
discussing you know brings up a lot of

1126
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,200
emotion and what's even worse is that

1127
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,720
Ashley didn't stop

1128
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,640
there that exchange that we just went

1129
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,480
through was in

1130
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,280
2020 now 3 years later several months

1131
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,760
ago after I caught Ashley and the other

1132
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,400
plotters for what they were trying to do

1133
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,319
to Anthony and the medical medium

1134
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,240
community

1135
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:02,440
and we exposed them in our podcast

1136
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:05,000
episodes Ashley went on a rampage on

1137
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,920
social media rather than addressing any

1138
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,960
of her false claims we had corrected her

1139
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,000
on with evidence she pivoted onto other

1140
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,079
points of focus she began bullying and

1141
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,599
making fun of Anthony she made fun of

1142
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:19,000
the light blast and the collecting

1143
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,200
Stones meditation she made fun of the

1144
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,119
medical medium Community many of its

1145
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:28,200
members one of her targets was you and

1146
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:32,079
shockingly your kids

1147
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,720
on August 17th Ashley posted this this

1148
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:38,520
is not enough fuel for a child to thrive

1149
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,480
if you watch closely you will see that

1150
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,400
the children of influencers who promote

1151
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:49,000
extremely restricted diets are often

1152
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,000
incredibly small just like Kim's

1153
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:58,079
kids in this she tagged you along with a

1154
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,440
screenshot of a pH photo of your three

1155
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,599
kids plates that you had posted that

1156
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,920
you'd captioned Beach

1157
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,720
snacks the plates all have a lot of

1158
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,799
avocado a bunch of cucumber sticks a

1159
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,079
bunch of strawberries and a pile of

1160
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:14,640
cooked cassava flour tortilla

1161
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,599
chips Ashley continues on in the next

1162
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,240
story post switching back to the priate

1163
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,520
convo for a second many of you are

1164
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,680
sharing more accounts of raw vegan

1165
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,440
children and it's really sad a few of

1166
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,240
you have made the point point that some

1167
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,760
kids are just small and that's true some

1168
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,880
kids are just small but all of RA vegan

1169
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,799
kids are noticeably small in a

1170
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,960
significant way I've never seen a single

1171
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:46,799
example otherwise Bud would welcome

1172
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:51,000
being challenged on that

1173
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:52,559
point and then just a little bit later

1174
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,280
after Ashley must have gotten some

1175
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,359
serious push back on this she deleted

1176
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,720
the first story and then posted this one

1177
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:03,640
I did remove that repost of the lunch

1178
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,480
trays though because it didn't sit right

1179
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:10,760
with me I don't want to tear down moms

1180
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,040
on here however I still think it is sad

1181
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:17,599
and abusive to raise your kids on a

1182
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:21,079
severely restricted diet how about

1183
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,760
y'all when I first read this I was sick

1184
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:28,119
to my stomach this is truly despicable

1185
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,720
behavior from Ashley and I would ask any

1186
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,280
mom out there how would you feel if

1187
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,359
somebody did this to you and your kids

1188
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,760
everyone is entitled of course to their

1189
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:39,280
own dietary belief system but it is

1190
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,520
unacceptable to shame and attack moms

1191
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,839
publicly for how you think they feed

1192
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,400
their kids like

1193
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,680
this next I have to walk us through and

1194
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,040
point out the falsehoods and

1195
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,960
inconsistencies here because it's

1196
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,880
insane Ashley attacked yuk Kim for

1197
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,799
supposedly Mal nourishing your children

1198
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,640
referring to photo of your kids plates

1199
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:03,440
as lunch trays when in the exact

1200
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,760
screenshot as used from you you

1201
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,160
literally captioned it Beach snacks and

1202
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,960
she has that in the photo that she

1203
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,880
reposted how much sense does it make to

1204
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,880
judge what somebody feeds their kids as

1205
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,640
a snack as if it were a meal first of

1206
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,720
all and then the snack plates in the

1207
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,000
photo have plenty of food on them there

1208
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,640
are piles of cooked cassava flower chips

1209
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,680
with guacamole there are plenty of

1210
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,280
strawberries and cucumber sticks as I

1211
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,880
said they were Beach snacks they weren't

1212
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,480
intended to be a Thanksgiving dinner

1213
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,480
they were

1214
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,480
snacks once again Ashley got it

1215
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,599
wrong all of your posts online show your

1216
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,359
fridge being loaded with huge amounts of

1217
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,599
food and your kids eating plenty of food

1218
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,640
with tons of variety your kids are

1219
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,200
obviously far from restricted and it's

1220
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,839
clear that Ashley was just trying to

1221
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,680
hurt you and I'm

1222
00:52:54,839 --> 00:53:00,000
sorry thank you yeah she definitely got

1223
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,400
me with that one um it first made me

1224
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,920
really mad I cried a lot and then I

1225
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,559
actually started to laugh because it's

1226
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,960
just so insane we were traveling when I

1227
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,960
posted those trays it was my husband's

1228
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,559
40th birthday those trays don't belong

1229
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:21,480
to me but I can tell you they were giant

1230
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:24,359
man-sized trays my baby was one at the

1231
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:28,079
time my daughter in preschool and my son

1232
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:30,440
is eight they're little young children

1233
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,119
you are correct Amber these were snacks

1234
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,960
to take to the

1235
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,000
beach as for the insults about my kids I

1236
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,040
was so sick years ago before medical

1237
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,720
medium and these kids were raised with

1238
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:45,440
the principles that healed my body none

1239
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,880
of them have ever had a cavity they

1240
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,680
rarely catch colds and flu and when they

1241
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,119
get something they bounce right back I

1242
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,400
attribute that to the way that we live

1243
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,640
and I would never call that restrictive

1244
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,319
illness is restrict restrictive Wellness

1245
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,559
is freedom and I know so many of you

1246
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:07,760
would agree with

1247
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:10,680
that yes yes really well said and I also

1248
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,799
want to point out how Ashley conflates

1249
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,960
medical medium information with raw

1250
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:17,920
veganism yet again I know that your kids

1251
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,359
are not raw

1252
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,960
vegan yeah Amber my kids are not raw

1253
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:24,799
vegan they never have been I have no

1254
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,040
idea why Ashley would put me in that

1255
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:28,920
category there's nothing

1256
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,559
wrong with raw vegans but my kids are

1257
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:36,880
not and they never have been my son has

1258
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:38,839
consumed cooked soup that Ashley herself

1259
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,359
made while I was staying with

1260
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:43,599
her um that was when we went to visit

1261
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,720
her family's home in PPP Beach my son

1262
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,319
was also one of the first ones to trial

1263
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,720
her cooked bread recipe and some of the

1264
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,880
cooked potato recipe in Ashley's ebooks

1265
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,760
that I always supported one scroll back

1266
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,160
will let all of you see that my kids eat

1267
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,799
loads of produce yes they do and they

1268
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,119
enjoy it but they also consumed cooked

1269
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,559
foods and they eat plenty of Treats

1270
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,200
they're kids you

1271
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:13,240
guys once again Ashley got it

1272
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,559
wrong yeah once again very wrong it's so

1273
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,599
upsetting

1274
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,720
and I'm sure I'm sure it's so upsetting

1275
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:26,359
I can't imagine having my kids attacked

1276
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:29,640
like that um it's so Ashley has actually

1277
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:30,559
senen your kids eat cooked food that she

1278
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,680
made

1279
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,880
herself and she still called them raw

1280
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,760
vegan it's it's mind-blowing correct and

1281
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,799
correct what's so insane and what also

1282
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,240
speaks to how carelessly Ashley just

1283
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:47,039
hurdles out attacks with paying such

1284
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,359
little attention to facts and details is

1285
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:53,400
that in the exact screenshot Ashley took

1286
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:56,520
from you and displayed in her post it

1287
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,160
clearly shows cooked chips on all of

1288
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,799
your kids plates you even tagged the

1289
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,599
brand of the cooked chips you gave your

1290
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:06,799
kids as a snack with guacamole anybody

1291
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:09,440
could figure out that they are cooked

1292
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:12,359
chips and obviously if you're feeding

1293
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,839
your kids cooked chips they're not raw

1294
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:16,359
vegan and what Ashley's saying doesn't

1295
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,920
make any

1296
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:22,079
sense Ashley got all of these things so

1297
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,920
wrong anybody who's viewing these

1298
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,599
stories can catch the inconsistencies

1299
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,240
for themselves but this is how as asy is

1300
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,200
sloppy Ashley never has the details

1301
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,039
right makes mistakes constantly and

1302
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:39,079
leaves a trail of falsities

1303
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:41,680
everywhere and then in this series of

1304
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,960
attacks on your kids Ashley had the

1305
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:49,599
audacity to call your children

1306
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,799
small Kim your kids are objectively some

1307
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:55,280
of the healthiest and strongest looking

1308
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:58,240
kids that I've ever seen it's ridiculous

1309
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,240
thank you

1310
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,599
I'm super blessed in that department and

1311
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:05,160
if you followed along with my journey

1312
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,240
you've likely seen the pictures of my

1313
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,240
son that I've shared over the past year

1314
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,799
I'm pretty proud of him he's ahead

1315
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,799
taller than most of the kids in this

1316
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,799
grade he's 90th percentile for height

1317
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:17,720
he's a travel and All-Star baseball

1318
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:20,920
player in fact he was on three baseball

1319
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,799
teams this year he's strong he's fast

1320
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,640
he's unbelievable and I know that sounds

1321
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,599
ridiculous because he's my son but I

1322
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,880
have every right to be proud after I

1323
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,520
went through what I went through with

1324
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,160
his birth and postpartum with him and

1325
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,280
just being so unwell years ago before

1326
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,200
finding Anthony he's not small at all

1327
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,960
it's quite the opposite my middle

1328
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,280
daughter and there's been a lot of

1329
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,480
commenting about her in the community

1330
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,440
because I've shared her too she's a

1331
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,480
gymnast she's an All-Star cheerleader

1332
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,839
who has literally abs of steel um if

1333
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,960
you've seen videos of her you've likely

1334
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:55,680
seen a lot of you have commented she's

1335
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,520
literally jacked the girl has muscles

1336
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,200
that I didn't have when I was training

1337
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,920
during some of the most intense training

1338
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:06,280
periods of my life she's muscle and my

1339
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:09,000
baby who is now to is literally a tub

1340
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:12,079
she's got a couple chin rolls um so

1341
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,960
while this does make me angry and you

1342
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,240
know she did attack my children I really

1343
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,880
think that one simple photo tells it all

1344
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,200
it's time for me to speak out because

1345
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,799
actually Ashley is a bully she bullied

1346
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,920
my children who does that really who

1347
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:30,880
does that that these are lies she has no

1348
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,319
business commenting on my children she

1349
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,240
has no idea how big or small they are

1350
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:37,520
she has no idea what they

1351
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,160
eat I'm still laughing at the

1352
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,400
accusations from the chips and guacamole

1353
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,480
plate that was my husband's

1354
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,599
40th birthday it was a party at the

1355
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,079
beach this is just one example of how my

1356
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,440
life has been disrupted for years now

1357
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:56,400
because of Ashley her social media post

1358
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,160
ruined that trip for me and my husband

1359
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,440
40th birthday because they changed my

1360
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,240
mood completely they were hurtful and

1361
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:09,599
they brought a tremendous amount of

1362
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:12,839
stress by publicly attacking me and my

1363
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,440
kids yeah it's terrible and it's

1364
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:18,039
ridiculous Ashley never should have

1365
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,160
stooped that low she never should have

1366
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:23,520
done that then after Ashley clearly must

1367
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,079
have gotten called out Ashley said she

1368
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,640
removed that post because she doesn't

1369
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,760
want to tear down mom on here but she

1370
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,960
still left another story post up in

1371
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,280
which she attacked a different mom and

1372
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,359
her kid for their diet it's obvious that

1373
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,640
the whole point of these posts was to

1374
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,119
put down moms for how Ashley thinks they

1375
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,400
feed their kids and the way that their

1376
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:48,400
kids look and like you said Kim who does

1377
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,760
that Ashley literally used the word

1378
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,359
abuse and applied that you were abusing

1379
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,240
your kids by what you're feeding them

1380
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,520
when she wasn't even accurate with any

1381
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,319
of her claims

1382
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,520
there's nothing more egregious Ashley

1383
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,359
just didn't get away with it and after

1384
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,319
receiving push back that's when she

1385
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:08,359
deleted some of it your kids are not

1386
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:10,960
even raw

1387
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:14,640
vegan some of it yeah she deleted only

1388
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,720
some of it and some left other parts up

1389
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,359
yeah your kids are not even raw vegan

1390
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,839
medical medium information is not the

1391
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,440
same thing as raw veganism her posts

1392
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,640
don't make logical sense Ashley's raw

1393
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,119
vegan attacks are also a especially

1394
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,960
baffling to me considering the fact that

1395
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:36,359
many of her own best friends and

1396
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:38,640
co-plot are actually raw vegans yeah I

1397
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:41,119
wonder how Ashley's raw vegan co-

1398
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,760
plotters and best friends feel now about

1399
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,839
how they have supported Ashley and

1400
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,200
getting to where she is now that she

1401
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:49,720
uses her platform to viciously criticize

1402
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,880
the diet that they follow and promote in

1403
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,160
their businesses going as far as to call

1404
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,440
moms who feed their kids raw vegan food

1405
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,079
abusive

1406
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,160
plus what Ashley said in this Rampage is

1407
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:06,319
wildly contradictive to what Ashley has

1408
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,039
said herself in the past in an Instagram

1409
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:11,119
story post that Ashley made at the end

1410
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:14,160
of 2019 to sell her own ebook she said

1411
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:18,119
this you deserve to nourish your body in

1412
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,960
whatever way you choose without fear of

1413
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:24,200
condemnation you deserve unquestioned

1414
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:27,920
authority over what your children are

1415
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,920
fed unreal

1416
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,240
wild

1417
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:36,359
contradiction this is another prime

1418
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,160
example of sloppy Ashley it's a prime

1419
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:40,599
example of someone who is always

1420
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,079
changing to fit a narrative that suits

1421
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:46,440
her agenda of the

1422
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:49,039
moment Kim this was absolutely

1423
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:51,640
reprehensible of Ashley to do to your to

1424
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,279
you and your family and I'm so sorry

1425
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,839
that you were the target of this attack

1426
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,160
and that your kids were the target of

1427
01:01:54,839 --> 01:02:00,079
this attack

1428
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:03,119
it's been a lot it's impacted my husband

1429
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,559
in a big way too it's been completely

1430
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:09,359
unnecessary stress and from mother to

1431
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,760
mother all I think about every time she

1432
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,440
puts these posts out there is that this

1433
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,039
is time and energy away from our kids

1434
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,599
and away from our families we're not

1435
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,960
getting this time

1436
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:24,039
back like I said so many trips so many

1437
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,760
family events so many holidays so many

1438
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:30,200
birthdays have been ruined for me

1439
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,680
because of unnecessary abuse from

1440
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Ashley Kim I can't imagine being a mom

1441
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,039
and then being publicly shamed for

1442
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,680
feeding your kids healthy

1443
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:43,359
snacks and being shamed in a way that

1444
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:47,079
confuses people into thinking that you

1445
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:50,359
must be some kind of terrible Mom that's

1446
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:53,880
abusively starving your kids it's

1447
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:56,599
uncons sadly Ashley has so many things

1448
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,440
wrong another exhibit on how Ashley

1449
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,480
makes mistakes it makes sense as to how

1450
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Ashley got everything wrong to begin

1451
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,839
with with the Stephanie story when you

1452
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,640
look at how many things how many details

1453
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:11,799
and how many claims are twisted

1454
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,160
discombobulated and just straight out

1455
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:14,160
factually

1456
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:25,039
incorrect exactly exactly and now Kim I

1457
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:26,279
want to just bring us back to 2020 for a

1458
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,119
moment

1459
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:30,559
I know that Ashley was attacking you in

1460
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,520
a similar way in the comments of her

1461
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,880
retaliation post back then and implying

1462
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,920
that you hadn't done enough for

1463
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,160
Stephanie when she was sick your husband

1464
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,480
defended you in a comment in which he

1465
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:44,640
said this to Ashley can't sleep because

1466
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,799
your comment of expecting Kimberly to go

1467
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,880
in a hospital right after having a child

1468
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:52,119
is ridiculous postpartum mothers are

1469
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,960
supposed to be resting she wasn't

1470
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:56,359
resting as she was making food and other

1471
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,640
stuff to send to Steph on top of driving

1472
01:03:56,359 --> 01:04:01,160
it to her before she was cleared to

1473
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,880
actually drive all of this led to the

1474
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,240
health issues you mentioned of an

1475
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,760
enlarged uterus from not resting and

1476
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,079
taking care of herself clearly wasn't

1477
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,599
enough for you I guess and for the

1478
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,400
record I was the one that held her back

1479
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,039
and didn't want her to do even more than

1480
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,279
she already did and kept her out of the

1481
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:21,000
hospital which is no place for a new

1482
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:22,799
mother if it can be avoided so I guess

1483
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,200
I'm the bad guy here for trying to

1484
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,200
protect

1485
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,520
Kimberly all of this was was playing out

1486
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,799
online at the same time as Ashley was

1487
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,480
attacking you in the written and audio

1488
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,880
texts we went through

1489
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,200
previously and then there was an email

1490
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,920
you'd sent to someone who was your

1491
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,119
friend at the time the next

1492
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,440
morning I have that email in front of me

1493
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,319
and it says thank you for the email last

1494
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,960
night Ashley started sending me terrible

1495
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:51,880
text messages voice messages and then

1496
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,480
that post I'm not sure what prompted all

1497
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,559
of it honestly I didn't even read it as

1498
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,359
I was at a family event honoring my soon

1499
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,079
to be sister-in-law my poor husband was

1500
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,920
defending our side of the story as she

1501
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,119
put my personal information right in

1502
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,480
that post and failed to mention that I

1503
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,160
had a baby who was just weeks old as we

1504
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,440
were still running around and trying to

1505
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:14,359
do what we could on No Sleep our lives

1506
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,079
are very different and I don't think Ash

1507
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:18,240
can understand a family that has to work

1508
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,839
for a living and care for their children

1509
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,799
without help and servants I'm not being

1510
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:24,480
condescending but realistic the

1511
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,079
statements she made about me were

1512
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,039
appalling I was driving things to Steph

1513
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:31,720
before I was even cleared to drive a car

1514
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:34,760
after birth these girls put that

1515
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:37,039
pressure on me my husband was so upset

1516
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,480
that he took on as much as he could I'm

1517
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,440
really really hurt by the twists and

1518
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,119
lies it's a different lifestyle and she

1519
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,119
can't wrap her head around a mother

1520
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:48,400
working and caring for two children

1521
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:51,359
without a nanny or understand that

1522
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,799
husbands leave and go to work all of

1523
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,520
this on no sleep with a newborn and a

1524
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:59,000
2-year-old but somehow I didn't do

1525
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,839
enough for her I had Gretchen staying at

1526
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,920
my home during such a sacred time of

1527
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:06,480
having a newborn not to mention my fear

1528
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,319
of her being in and out of the hospital

1529
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,839
and around my tiny new baby I don't know

1530
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:13,480
what the answer is here but she is

1531
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:16,279
pointing a lot of fingers and there is

1532
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,839
no truth to so much of what she's saying

1533
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:22,119
I feel awful harsh and heavy energy from

1534
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:24,880
her she has an agenda to spread fear and

1535
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:27,839
make herself look like a hero I wish she

1536
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,559
would spread life and her love and her

1537
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:33,359
beautiful spirit this is just upsetting

1538
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,279
anyway I'm pretty exhausted from all of

1539
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:37,520
this I hope you are resting today as I

1540
01:06:35,279 --> 01:06:38,960
can barely move from all the stress last

1541
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,520
night

1542
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:45,119
Kimberly can you share more with us Kim

1543
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,319
about why why it was that Ashley and

1544
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,720
Gretchen were putting so much pressure

1545
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:51,200
on you to help Stephanie more and more

1546
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,359
when you just had a baby there was so

1547
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,079
much going on and it was up to a 4-Hour

1548
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:58,520
drive one way

1549
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,400
for you why did Stephanie need so much

1550
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,480
help with food poor Stephanie wouldn't

1551
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,559
eat the hospital food she was relying on

1552
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,480
friends to bring her food when she

1553
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,640
couldn't get enough help from friends or

1554
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,039
family she just wouldn't eat looking

1555
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,400
back I asked myself why wouldn't an

1556
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:19,119
extremely wealthy friend send food a

1557
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:21,480
chef support something instead I was

1558
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,480
pushed to the max I opened up my home

1559
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,079
postpartum to Gretchen who came to care

1560
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,920
for Steph Gretchen was also met at the

1561
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,680
airport with a hot tea and a home-cooked

1562
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,559
meal that my husband and I prepared for

1563
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,400
her I wanted to support the situation as

1564
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:38,640
best I could at the time but nothing I'm

1565
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,599
telling you nothing that I did was good

1566
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,279
enough

1567
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,440
nothing I don't get that time back with

1568
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:46,640
my newborn I don't get to do it again I

1569
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,839
don't get to hold her again as a newborn

1570
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,319
I don't get to be there again with my

1571
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:54,480
two-year-old son I I went through all of

1572
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:57,720
this and that time is just it's gone

1573
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,799
it's passed and now I live with Ash

1574
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:04,079
trashing me whenever she

1575
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:08,839
chooses and continuing to disrupt your

1576
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:11,279
family time and it just seems really odd

1577
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:13,640
to me that you were the object of blame

1578
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:15,200
here and especially when you and your

1579
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,480
husband did as much as you could for

1580
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,799
Stephanie after just having a baby and

1581
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,839
not living that close to her it seems

1582
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:24,719
like over and over again throughout the

1583
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:29,359
whole Stephanie situation the plotters

1584
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:33,080
Ashley Robbie Taylor Christina Megan

1585
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:35,960
Tony Gretchen have tried to place blame

1586
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,199
on people who were actually trying to

1587
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,159
help yeah many of Stephanie's friends

1588
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:42,319
were just doing the best they could to

1589
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:44,159
help her when it was possible and that

1590
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,040
was all acceptable they were happy if

1591
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,679
someone donated some time or some energy

1592
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,480
or some food or whatever it was but

1593
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,319
somehow I was definitely a Target in the

1594
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,159
whole thing I was being pushed to do

1595
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,719
more and more and more and whatever I

1596
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,560
did it was not good good enough I did

1597
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,560
what I could in the situation I was in

1598
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,679
with a brand new baby somehow the

1599
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,239
2-year-old little boy and the several

1600
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:09,560
week old little girl that I had in my

1601
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:11,239
arms while my husband was away at work

1602
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,759
was completely overlooked they just kept

1603
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,000
looking at me like I was some kind of

1604
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:18,480
robot that was supposed to go and do and

1605
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,520
do more and more it was

1606
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:25,520
horrible wow yeah wow and in reality I

1607
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,640
mean you were trying so hard to help

1608
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,319
Stephanie in an impossible situation on

1609
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,679
no sleep that you actually had gasoline

1610
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:35,159
sprayed all over you to the point that

1611
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,839
your hair was drenched and Ashley who

1612
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:40,960
was putting all this pressure on you was

1613
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:42,960
nowhere to be found and an exposure like

1614
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,120
that of getting straight gasoline

1615
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,239
sprayed all over your head all on your

1616
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,960
hair all over your body it's treacherous

1617
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:54,400
that much gasoline all on your body

1618
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,400
soaked on you like that gets absorbed

1619
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,080
into your breast milk milk you just had

1620
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,560
a baby and then your immune system is

1621
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,159
already comp compromised because you had

1622
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:08,080
a baby and then you yourself Kim were

1623
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:10,520
sick years ago this is a major exposure

1624
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,920
which could trigger your system and then

1625
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,440
if you were sitting in your car right

1626
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:18,679
after you just had gasoline dumped all

1627
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:22,440
over you if you had accidentally hit the

1628
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:24,640
car lighter with your elbow or your hand

1629
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:28,800
or your phone just by putting your phone

1630
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:32,120
down you could have gone up in Flames

1631
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,360
all it would take is just one spark from

1632
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,320
an electrical wire from just the

1633
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:39,719
ignition of the car starting and you

1634
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,640
would have burned up and died along with

1635
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:44,960
your baby in the car all because you're

1636
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:48,320
helping out a friend Stephanie while

1637
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,760
Ashley was sitting in Malibu in her

1638
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,480
multi-million dollar house and then

1639
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,760
spreading rumors and false claims about

1640
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:59,239
how you and Stephanie weren't even

1641
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,760
friends yeah not

1642
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:04,600
friends it actually haunts me Anthony

1643
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,440
the whole situation haunts me it was

1644
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,520
traumatic like truly traumatic for me

1645
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,600
and to have to live with the constant

1646
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,040
social media insults threats and stress

1647
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,440
it just brings it all up over and over

1648
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,560
and over again every single time I see

1649
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,840
her starting posting it's like the antic

1650
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,159
start and I just it it all comes up over

1651
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:30,199
and over again for me

1652
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:33,840
I'm so sorry Kim thanks Amber

1653
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:39,520
and yeah you you

1654
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,520
also it's awful yeah it's

1655
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:46,080
awful you also ended up unfortunately

1656
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:48,840
with an enlarged uterus because you were

1657
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,880
standing up constantly making food

1658
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,120
driving long distances before you were

1659
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,560
cleared to and bringing food to

1660
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,920
Stephanie instead of resting post partum

1661
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,840
and at the same time Ashley was nowhere

1662
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,360
to be

1663
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,199
found while you were going so far out of

1664
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,280
your way to help Stephanie that you

1665
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:12,239
risked your own life and your baby's

1666
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,600
life and sacrificed your body literally

1667
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:17,000
to help you did all of this because

1668
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,840
Stephanie was a close friend of

1669
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,440
yours and Ashley was nowhere to be found

1670
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,960
yet Ashley has the nerve and entitlement

1671
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,320
to imply that you weren't doing enough

1672
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,600
for Steph and that you weren't even a

1673
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:35,000
friend of hers at

1674
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:38,880
all Yeah Ashley always communicated as a

1675
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,639
very entitled manipulative woman I just

1676
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,320
didn't know to what extent back then

1677
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:45,480
that she was

1678
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,000
entitled um when we all flew out to

1679
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,320
Pebble Beach to stay in her family's

1680
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,880
home Stephanie actually didn't have the

1681
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:55,320
money to go and it was a really touchy

1682
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:58,360
subject but meanwhile Ashley the

1683
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,560
daughter of a billionaire family didn't

1684
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:03,639
offer support to her then I looked back

1685
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,840
at those emails wondering why did Ashley

1686
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:07,639
not just buy her a ticket if they were

1687
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,840
such good

1688
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:13,480
friends yeah it's a really great

1689
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,840
question and I looked through those

1690
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,760
emails there are a few I want to read

1691
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,360
off for everyone the first one was from

1692
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:24,560
Stephanie to everyone on the email

1693
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,679
thread that Ashley had invited to a

1694
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:31,400
weekend get get away it was sent on

1695
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,920
January 11th of 2017 just a few months

1696
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,880
before Stephanie discovered her breast

1697
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:40,360
lump and it says hey I'm still in the

1698
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,080
unknown territory if I can come or not

1699
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,760
financially at the moment not best

1700
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,360
however things could turn around and

1701
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:50,400
make it possible very quickly flight

1702
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,400
prices are low so that's a plus so I may

1703
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,600
have to wait as it gets closer to make a

1704
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,280
move is that okay

1705
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,199
this question was directed to Ashley and

1706
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,960
Stephanie said that flight prices are

1707
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:04,280
low but still too much for her to afford

1708
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,280
at the

1709
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:10,080
moment then on January 22nd of 2017

1710
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,960
Ashley sends an email to everyone in the

1711
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,040
group with a status update and some

1712
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,639
background information about each person

1713
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,120
for her friends who hadn't met each

1714
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:23,360
other before Ashley's update to everyone

1715
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:26,480
about Stephanie says this Stephanie

1716
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:30,400
possible Steph is trying to make it work

1717
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,679
financially I so want her to be there

1718
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,960
Steph is a wealth of information and a

1719
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:37,960
bright positive Shining Light in any

1720
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,320
group she's part of for dinner she likes

1721
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,440
to eat heads of Roma lettuce dipped in

1722
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:46,520
kind pepper and lemon if that's not next

1723
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:51,120
level I don't know what

1724
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:54,040
is I was shocked by this email because

1725
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:56,719
here Ashley is actually praising

1726
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:59,120
Stephanie for for eating only lettuce

1727
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:02,840
with cayenne and lemon for

1728
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:05,040
dinner as we've covered a lot obviously

1729
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:08,000
aead of lettuce as a meal let alone for

1730
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,199
dinner is not enough it is not MediCal

1731
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,080
medium information this is something

1732
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:16,239
Anthony absolutely advises against it

1733
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:19,719
was Stephanie's pre-existing approach to

1734
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:22,560
food that here we see Ashley praising

1735
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:24,120
and calling next level like restricting

1736
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,800
yourself is something that everyone

1737
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:30,159
should aspire to do and Ashley said in

1738
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:33,199
this email that she so wants Stephanie

1739
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:35,920
to be there Stephanie had said herself

1740
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:38,760
that flight prices were low at the time

1741
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,760
in 2017 flight prices were quite a bit

1742
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,320
cheaper than they are today I'm sure

1743
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,840
that she could have gotten a flight from

1744
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:47,400
Philly to La where Ashley suggested

1745
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:51,320
everyone to fly into from a Budget

1746
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:54,280
Airline for 99 to

1747
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:57,800
$150 Ashley is the daughter of a

1748
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:59,880
billionaire and has a trust fund as you

1749
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,560
said if Ashley was truly such great

1750
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,480
friends with Stephanie and really wanted

1751
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,639
Stephanie there why wouldn't Ashley have

1752
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:10,480
just gotten her the plane

1753
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:12,159
ticket yeah looking back I really do not

1754
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,600
understand it especially with all the

1755
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:16,120
finger pointing Ashley has done Ashley

1756
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,040
let her miss out because Stephanie

1757
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,440
couldn't afford it and then Ashley even

1758
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,080
asked everyone in the group who was

1759
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,440
coming to her family's multi-million

1760
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:26,440
dollar home for a weekend for a cleaning

1761
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,440
fee

1762
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,800
I saw that in the email

1763
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:36,800
thread unbelievable a cleaning

1764
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:39,400
fee so after the Pebble Beach thing just

1765
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,960
a few months later Stephanie discovers

1766
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,560
her breast lump in March and then she

1767
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,679
injures her back and then she gets sick

1768
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,239
during the time that Stephanie was Ill

1769
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:51,360
how would you describe Ashley's

1770
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:53,320
relationship with Stephanie's family do

1771
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,080
you know if they interacted were they

1772
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:58,600
close what was that like Ashley actually

1773
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,920
talked negatively about Stephanie's

1774
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,480
family there was this constant thing

1775
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,480
where the family wanted Stephanie to

1776
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,560
receive conventional Cancer Care and the

1777
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,239
plotters were not in agreement with the

1778
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,520
family's wishes Stephanie's personal

1779
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:16,120
wishes were pushed completely to the

1780
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,080
side at the time the plotters and the

1781
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:21,520
family were not on the same page at all

1782
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,920
so it's so unbelievably strange to me

1783
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:27,920
that now they've come together to blame

1784
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,560
and attack Anthony who wasn't even

1785
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,280
involved in Stephanie's Cancer Care

1786
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,679
because the family cut off communication

1787
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,600
with him it was a lot for me birthing a

1788
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,840
baby and trying to simultaneously

1789
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,040
support a friend who was not well and

1790
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,800
listening to Stephanie stress literally

1791
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,800
stress about her support people closest

1792
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:49,000
to her not getting along I was dealing

1793
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,280
with the text threads with the plotters

1794
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,400
that were trashing and fighting with her

1795
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,400
family it was horrendous seeing those

1796
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,360
same plotters who were disagreeing with

1797
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:02,600
and arguing with Stephanie's family now

1798
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:06,080
representing and advocating for them or

1799
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:08,639
with them is very confusing to me my own

1800
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:11,040
data clearly shows that there was a

1801
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:13,679
major issue between the platters and

1802
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,000
Stephanie's family my husband witnessed

1803
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,560
this in person when he went into the

1804
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,159
hospital to visit Stephanie the plotters

1805
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:26,440
and the family were not on the same

1806
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:28,080
page that's extremely interesting and is

1807
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:30,760
something that's very it's very

1808
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:33,800
confusing to think about that as well

1809
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:37,159
and how things somehow changed and

1810
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,440
flipped in that way and then what

1811
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:41,440
happened when your husband went to the

1812
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,440
hospital to visit and bring food to

1813
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:47,239
Stephanie what what did he

1814
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:49,600
see so my husband observed an argument

1815
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:52,080
between Taylor Stephanie and Stephanie's

1816
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,760
family Stephanie didn't want the

1817
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,239
treatment at the hospital that was being

1818
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,840
offered at that moment

1819
01:18:55,239 --> 01:19:01,239
she was crying it's heartbreaking Taylor

1820
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:04,199
was on her team and she was fighting

1821
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:06,600
with the family Stephany wanted to go to

1822
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:09,639
Mexico for an alternative treatment but

1823
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,520
her family didn't agree to this my

1824
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:13,560
husband just wanted to have a genuine

1825
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,360
conversation with Stephanie the way that

1826
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,440
he had so many times in the past but it

1827
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,080
was uncomfortable and impossible because

1828
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,639
of this conflict that was going on while

1829
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,560
he was there instead he tried to be

1830
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:25,360
helpful and find creative ways to keep

1831
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:29,280
the food cold and be sure the juices

1832
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:31,400
were kept fresh for her but the family

1833
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,880
they always hated the way that she ate

1834
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,040
dating back years before Stephanie even

1835
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:38,679
knew Anthony the family did not like the

1836
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:40,120
way that she ate the family made my

1837
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:41,800
husband feel like he was a villain for

1838
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,400
bringing food to

1839
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:47,480
Stephanie

1840
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:49,639
wow so there was this massive ongoing

1841
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:53,440
battle between the plotters and the

1842
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:55,080
family completely independent of Anthony

1843
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,280
and just to bring this all together for

1844
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,719
everyone all Anthony ever did in this

1845
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:02,679
whole situation as we've shown was

1846
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:05,000
encourage Stephanie to see a doctor

1847
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:07,440
offer emotional support and try to get

1848
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,600
her up off the floor she got stuck on

1849
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,480
due to her injury so that she could get

1850
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,560
in for proper Medical Care Anthony was

1851
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,920
not Stephanie's health practitioner

1852
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,719
Anthony is not an oncologist in order to

1853
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,000
get diagnosed with cancer you need to

1854
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:24,400
see a board certified

1855
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,400
oncologist from the moment Stephanie

1856
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,920
discovered her breast lump she was

1857
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,159
repeatedly told by Anthony to see a

1858
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:33,360
physician if Stephanie had listened to

1859
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:34,040
Anthony's advice to see a doctor from

1860
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,400
the

1861
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,840
beginning outcomes probably would have

1862
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,920
been entirely different and we probably

1863
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:44,199
wouldn't need to be sitting here today

1864
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:46,600
to talk about this and you Kim you even

1865
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:49,159
talked with Stephanie early on about

1866
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:51,600
doctors she could see in the area that

1867
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:53,600
were near her and you said earlier on

1868
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,679
that Stephanie wasn't receptive to that

1869
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,320
at the time

1870
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,520
and so then Stephanie's battle with

1871
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:03,320
cancer ended up going on for about a

1872
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:07,360
year after Anthony was told aggressively

1873
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:10,320
to stay away during that time again

1874
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,120
independent of Anthony the plotters were

1875
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,679
fighting for Stephanie to get some kind

1876
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,719
of alternative treatment for her cancer

1877
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:19,000
while the family on the other hand

1878
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,880
wanted her to do conventional

1879
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,600
treatment while Stephanie was sick the

1880
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:28,440
plotters and the family were at odds

1881
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:30,239
Waring with each other and then when did

1882
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,560
things change when did you see the

1883
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:34,239
plotter start coming around and and

1884
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,520
coming together with the family to try

1885
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:39,480
to blame

1886
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,239
Anthony I honestly didn't see things

1887
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,480
change until years after Stephanie

1888
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:45,000
passed away months after Stephanie

1889
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,360
passed away I was invited to her

1890
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,639
celebration of life the plotters were

1891
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,320
offering Retreats yeah they were

1892
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:55,159
offering retreats to the medical medium

1893
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,360
community and then all of a sudden

1894
01:21:55,159 --> 01:22:00,400
the pters changed their tune it was

1895
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:03,280
literally overnight and to me that seems

1896
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:08,800
so clear that an agenda was

1897
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:11,199
born yeah it's pretty crazy and then I

1898
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,639
want to bring it back to when Stephanie

1899
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:15,600
was Ill when you went to go bring

1900
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:18,120
Stephanie food at the time that she was

1901
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,199
living in her family's home what was

1902
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,080
that experience like for you I went to

1903
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:24,199
Stephanie's family's home to pick

1904
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,080
Gretchen up who was going to stay in my

1905
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:26,960
home

1906
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,920
Gretchen was using my husband's car but

1907
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,480
on that day he had to travel for work so

1908
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,760
I drove to pick her up I was drenched

1909
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,480
and gasolin by the time that I got there

1910
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,040
and needed to take a shower and rinse

1911
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:40,280
off as quickly as possible I showered in

1912
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:42,520
one of Stephanie's family's bathrooms it

1913
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,440
was really scary time for me I had my

1914
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,320
newborn baby and I brought her in her

1915
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,600
little car seat because Stephanie wanted

1916
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,520
to meet her she actually wasn't able to

1917
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,639
hold the baby due to the drugs that she

1918
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:55,840
was on I dropped off some food for her

1919
01:22:53,639 --> 01:22:57,920
and was just in shocked from all that

1920
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,400
happened with the gasoline and all that

1921
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,199
was happening around me in that moment

1922
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,520
it was around the same time when I was

1923
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:06,520
told by Gretchen that she had observed

1924
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,440
Stephanie with dust bunnies on her head

1925
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,000
and face and that Gretchen had to dust

1926
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,880
her off when she arrived in her home my

1927
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,159
heart was broken and honestly it still

1928
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,440
is

1929
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:19,639
Amber that is

1930
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:22,719
horrifying and the fact that it was

1931
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:25,239
Gretchen who is now a plotter who saw

1932
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,840
the dust situation is

1933
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:29,320
especially

1934
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,560
interesting yeah it was horrible all of

1935
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:33,360
it the the whole situation was horrible

1936
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,880
it was so hard to see it was hard to

1937
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,400
hear it was hard to experience and all

1938
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,520
at the same time with everything that I

1939
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,360
had going on I felt so terrible for

1940
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,719
Stephanie and I couldn't understand why

1941
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:47,080
and everything that she was going

1942
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:50,040
through that she would be covered in

1943
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,639
dust yeah yeah that's something that's

1944
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,840
really hard for me to wrap my head

1945
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:57,960
around as well and

1946
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:01,480
so then at some point when Stephanie was

1947
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:04,920
sick Taylor Who's now also a plotter

1948
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,960
stepped in could you explain what your

1949
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,040
experience was like with her and what

1950
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:12,159
role Taylor

1951
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,120
played so Taylor was one of the ones

1952
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:17,480
arguing at the hospital she basically

1953
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:20,280
took over but she also was not fond of

1954
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:23,199
the family and they were not F of her

1955
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:25,040
Taylor was in charge though or at least

1956
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:28,280
she thought she was in charge of the

1957
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:31,080
whole situation she was so manipulative

1958
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:33,639
and so bossy on the text messages and on

1959
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:36,159
the phone I had never even met her in

1960
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,320
person like have never met this woman

1961
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,560
ever yet she was calling me out and

1962
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,719
saying I needed to do more even though I

1963
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,320
had a newborn and I remember thinking

1964
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,840
that she was really insensitive and mean

1965
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,600
and I didn't and and she just didn't

1966
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,639
realize I'm like does this woman realize

1967
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,000
I have a newborn right now she she just

1968
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:56,159
didn't

1969
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
understand yeah that that description

1970
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:00,159
especially the bossiness matches a lot

1971
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,280
of the experiences that I had with

1972
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:05,560
Taylor several months ago in

1973
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:08,600
person um so so Stephanie was in a

1974
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,639
vulnerable position her back injury

1975
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:13,000
prevented her from being able to do much

1976
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,040
herself she was having a hard time

1977
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,040
getting the food that she needed you

1978
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:20,679
said earlier that she wasn't really

1979
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:23,000
making her own decisions Taylor who was

1980
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:25,080
acting you know as her caretaker and

1981
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,280
Stephanie's family were making a lot of

1982
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,840
decisions for her you were being

1983
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,719
supportive and trying to help out as

1984
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,080
best as you could did you and Stephanie

1985
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:37,679
stay in touch throughout the course of

1986
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:39,880
her illness or how did that go so for a

1987
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,000
long time we were in Daily communication

1988
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,480
personally and also in group chats with

1989
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,520
various different plotters that were

1990
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:48,360
discussing Stephanie's situation all of

1991
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,719
a sudden out of the blue Stephanie

1992
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,239
stopped responding to me I was told by

1993
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,920
Gretchen that her brother took her phone

1994
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:57,280
away and I never heard from her

1995
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,679
again I was also removed from the group

1996
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,760
chats it was very very weird because

1997
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:04,440
Stephanie normally would text a lot and

1998
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:07,119
send a lot of audio messages and all of

1999
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:09,280
that I was again newly postpartum so

2000
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,800
swallowing this was all really hard and

2001
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:14,520
I was just trying to survive and feeling

2002
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:19,080
completely heartbroken at the same

2003
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:21,760
time wow yeah so you were told by

2004
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:25,600
Gretchen that Stephanie's brother took

2005
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,600
Stephanie's phone away

2006
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,840
wow and we actually have text messages

2007
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,199
and audio recordings corroborating what

2008
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:35,119
you just said that we'll be sharing in

2009
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:37,560
another episode it's really sad that you

2010
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,600
had the same experience as other friends

2011
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:42,080
of Stephanie's who were either cut off

2012
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,560
without explanation or were told that

2013
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,119
they were not allowed to speak with her

2014
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,320
yeah and then I'm also curious about

2015
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:51,800
your experience with Stephanie before

2016
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:55,119
she got sick what were Stephanie's

2017
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:57,040
eating habits like before she got sick

2018
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:59,360
so actually shocking to me as someone

2019
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:01,760
that eats a very clean diet which has

2020
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:03,119
reversed my own symptoms years ago I I

2021
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,719
was actually shocked when I met

2022
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:08,320
Stephanie for lunch or at a juice bar

2023
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:10,320
she wouldn't eat it was very rare that

2024
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,360
she would eat something she mostly

2025
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,400
wouldn't eat at all not even at a

2026
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:18,679
completely organic juice bar one time I

2027
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:22,080
actually had a car full of fresh organic

2028
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:23,880
produce like wholesale produce fresh and

2029
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,320
she wouldn't touch any of the fruit and

2030
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,199
she would eat only the lettuce and I

2031
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:32,800
just always felt like she was starving

2032
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:32,800
and it just it just broke my

2033
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:39,199
heart yeah so you experienced Stephanie

2034
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:41,840
having some pre-existing problems with

2035
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:45,159
food just eating lettuce is definitely

2036
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:48,119
not MediCal medium information and it's

2037
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:50,560
really sad frankly yeah and

2038
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:53,280
yeah this goes along with so much

2039
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:56,280
evidence that we have of what Stephanie

2040
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:59,480
was eating and not eating which is the

2041
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:02,679
exact opposite of the story Ashley tried

2042
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:04,560
to tell starting in 2020 about Stephanie

2043
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:05,320
following medical medium information to

2044
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,880
a

2045
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:11,320
te so Ashley's told many false stories

2046
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,159
about Stephanie and many other things

2047
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,560
and now you've heard all the different

2048
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:19,760
iterations of the infamous cat story we

2049
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:23,040
shared earlier on in this podcast series

2050
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:25,760
Ashley told me directly in my calls with

2051
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,080
her that Anthony had put her on a

2052
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,199
fat-free raw diet and completely missed

2053
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:33,440
the cat

2054
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:36,040
allergy however one of the true

2055
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:38,920
versions of that cat story came from a

2056
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:42,480
text conversation Ashley had with you on

2057
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:44,639
September 14th of 2018 which was months

2058
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,960
after she had given away their pet cat

2059
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:50,520
because in fact Anthony had said that

2060
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:53,480
the cat was part of the problem in

2061
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,400
Ashley's text to you Ashley said that

2062
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:58,560
Anthony told her to cut out nuts and

2063
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:01,639
seeds specifically for her son's eczema

2064
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:04,000
but that fats like olive oil were

2065
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:06,199
okay she also said to you that Anthony

2066
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,840
had recommended lots of squash which is

2067
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:10,880
something that would be cooked of course

2068
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,719
not raw so Ashley obviously was not put

2069
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,360
on a fat-free raw

2070
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:19,600
diet yeah this one is really crazy to

2071
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:21,719
hear so many versions of this story

2072
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,840
Ashley and I were actually talking about

2073
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:27,119
this because my daughter had skin issues

2074
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,960
temporarily directly following my

2075
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,520
exposure to all the gasoline that I was

2076
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,719
sprayed with while I was breastfeeding

2077
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,440
her I have texts from Ashley saying that

2078
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:37,480
Anthony told her to cut out nuts and

2079
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,880
seeds specifically because of the

2080
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:42,639
Arginine and that other fats like olive

2081
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:44,920
oil were okay and cooked squashes were

2082
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:47,360
okay and that he suggested bringing in

2083
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:49,800
cooked squashes again along with

2084
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:54,320
bringing in lots of green

2085
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:55,480
juices yeah okay so

2086
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,280
now I'm

2087
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:01,239
wondering it's I mean years ago Ashley

2088
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,840
in all all these false stories I'm sure

2089
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:04,360
Ashley years ago told you a lot of the

2090
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,960
false stories that we've debunked in

2091
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,600
these podcasts like the origin of the

2092
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:12,360
breast lump Discovery and the infamous

2093
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:14,760
cat story and it's got to feel really

2094
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:16,920
weird to look back and realize that you

2095
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,840
too were told so many untrue stories

2096
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,400
that were Ashley's foundational building

2097
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:24,400
blocks to get Robbie and the others on

2098
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:26,560
board to try to take down the medical

2099
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,800
medium Community it has been really

2100
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:31,239
upsetting to see this story evolve after

2101
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,840
seeing Ashley tell her healing story at

2102
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:35,400
the medical medium live event I know

2103
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,040
some of you remember it or you remember

2104
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:42,679
hearing about it Ashley herself was

2105
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:45,040
suffering and I mean really suffering

2106
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:48,119
and hearing her words firsthand and

2107
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:51,159
seeing her life turn around and now for

2108
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:54,159
her to do this it doesn't make much

2109
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:56,600
sense to me the very information that

2110
01:30:54,159 --> 01:31:00,199
saved her life and these are her words

2111
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:02,600
not mine and Sav my life and several of

2112
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:05,679
the other practitioners were

2113
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:08,600
plotters and now to twist it and to

2114
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:13,119
trash it and to manipulate it into an

2115
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:16,840
article and into an agenda is just

2116
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:20,159
upsetting she has been trying so hard to

2117
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:22,600
convince everyone out there of things

2118
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:24,520
that are simply not true about Anthony

2119
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,239
and about this situation

2120
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,719
she tried to Corner me and make me

2121
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:31,159
believe things that are not true Anthony

2122
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,360
saved my life and I've watched thousands

2123
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:36,639
of Miracles over the years thanks to

2124
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:39,880
this information there is such a clear

2125
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:41,840
agenda here and I actually feel really

2126
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,520
bad for everyone who has been swallowed

2127
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:47,360
up by this so many of them have been

2128
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:50,960
saved by this same information thanks to

2129
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:54,040
Anthony and I know very personally that

2130
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:58,080
he has helped most of these plotters

2131
01:31:54,040 --> 01:32:02,280
some of them in their Darkest Hour even

2132
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,800
after Stephanie's death even when they

2133
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:07,440
have walked away from the information

2134
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,000
but that just tells you who Anthony

2135
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,840
is

2136
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,719
yeah

2137
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:18,040
wow I just have to say how sorry I am

2138
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:20,080
again that Ashley targeted you and your

2139
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:22,520
family came the way that she did in so

2140
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:25,000
many different instances she clearly

2141
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:27,520
didn't know the facts about this story

2142
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,560
she just felt entitled apparently to say

2143
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,480
whatever she

2144
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:33,600
wanted she said herself in her text to

2145
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,880
you that she didn't care about any of

2146
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,920
the people in the medical medium

2147
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,199
Community who she hurt with her 2020

2148
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,960
posts if Ashley had genuine questions or

2149
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:45,400
concerns about what had happened with

2150
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,520
Stephanie if she had any real interest

2151
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:50,000
in pursuing the truth she could have

2152
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:53,360
asked Anthony about anything she never

2153
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,360
did she could have asked you she never

2154
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,920
did

2155
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:59,880
she decided to take it public only a few

2156
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,760
months after still trying to sell the

2157
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,520
medical medium community on herself

2158
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:08,360
self-proclaimed expensive Retreats with

2159
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,600
celery juice and a weight loss plan she

2160
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,760
tried to act like some kind of hero or

2161
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:16,239
whistleblower when she used a completely

2162
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:18,719
false story Ashley exploited Stephanie

2163
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:22,560
and her private information which is the

2164
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:24,600
saddest part yeah she caused outrage and

2165
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,320
Chaos in the medical medium Community

2166
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,480
with her false stories she put you and

2167
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:31,760
others in a situation where you'd have

2168
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:34,159
to defend the truth and then she had the

2169
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:37,000
nerve to attack you for

2170
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:39,360
it yeah she attacked my family my

2171
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,040
children my profession and I just want

2172
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,239
to talk about her weight loss book for a

2173
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:46,400
second twisting the information and

2174
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:49,560
claiming to be an expert Beyond

2175
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:51,280
Anthony's books I don't quite understand

2176
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:55,000
it Amber but I can tell you that it

2177
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:58,159
confused a lot of people Ashley's ebook

2178
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,920
was targeting postpartum women and it

2179
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:04,639
was a weight loss plan with portion

2180
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:06,560
sizes in ounce amounts I consulted with

2181
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,400
a lot of postpartum women who were

2182
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,480
influenced by Ashley's ebook to eat less

2183
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:14,520
food and restrict their calories as a

2184
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,960
means of rapid weight loss they were

2185
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,400
under the impression that they were

2186
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,360
still following medical medium

2187
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,560
information when medical medium

2188
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,440
information does not restrict calories

2189
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,840
they were just following Ashley's

2190
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,239
Twisted

2191
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,320
information a lot of these women had

2192
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:32,239
their supply of breast milk drop because

2193
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,880
they were not eating enough and some of

2194
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,159
them even blamed medical medium

2195
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,119
information for that when it it wasn't

2196
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:40,760
medical medium information it was

2197
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:42,840
Ashley's portion controlled information

2198
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,760
that she was marketing to the community

2199
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,840
and it was so

2200
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:50,440
irresponsible Ashley has done a lot of

2201
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:55,360
damage I'm hurt and lost I'm traumatized

2202
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:55,360
by all of it and I just want it to stop

2203
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,719
yeah yeah that's crazy that you've had

2204
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,400
that you had those direct experiences

2205
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:06,480
and uh with the impact that

2206
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:09,760
Ashley's that her weight loss ebook had

2207
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,400
on women particularly postpartum women

2208
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,679
in the community that's extremely sad

2209
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,199
and Ashley really is the originator of

2210
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:20,840
twisting medical medium information and

2211
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:24,159
um she's had a lot of influence on how

2212
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:26,239
that's happened in more recent times

2213
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:30,440
even you know with other people in other

2214
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:33,159
cases and it's all really sad and Ashley

2215
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,040
has indeed done a lot of damage and

2216
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:37,239
that's why it's so important that we're

2217
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,440
here you know to set the record straight

2218
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:42,679
to help stop Ashley and the plotters

2219
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,840
from misleading deceiving hurting or

2220
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:47,360
taking the chance to heal away from

2221
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,960
anyone else so thank you very much Kim

2222
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,639
for coming on I know that you're a busy

2223
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,119
mom of three little ones and that this

2224
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,560
wasn't easy to do I really appreciate

2225
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:57,400
you being here and sharing a lot of

2226
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:00,480
these really difficult experiences and I

2227
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:02,639
appreciate both of you very much it's

2228
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:05,040
unfortunate that we had to get together

2229
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:07,199
for something like this setting the

2230
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:10,280
record straight I'm sure the medical

2231
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:12,400
medium community and anyone even outside

2232
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,880
of the medical medium Community truly

2233
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:18,119
appreciates your caring and willingness

2234
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:20,480
to get the truth out there thank you Kim

2235
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:24,800
thank you guys I appreciate you

2236
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:27,119
both thanks thanks

2237
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,840
as we are in the process of exposing

2238
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:32,280
Ashley and her organized hateful group

2239
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,320
for who and what they really are it's

2240
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,920
important to take note of their tactics

2241
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,880
and patterns that are likely to follow

2242
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,639
the plotters have a documented history

2243
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,840
of initiating attacks using lies and

2244
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:46,480
misinformation and then upon getting

2245
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:49,320
called out and corrected trying to flip

2246
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:52,080
it and play victim that is not going to

2247
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:54,880
work here all this group has done is

2248
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,719
spread verifiable lies and falsities

2249
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,360
they've carelessly attacked and harmed

2250
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,119
many innocent people they've used and

2251
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,800
exploited deceased individuals and

2252
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:05,400
others in the process of trying to get

2253
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,920
what they want they've repeatedly

2254
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,840
explicitly expressed the intent to harm

2255
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,560
medical medium and they've even

2256
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,760
deliberately tried to stop Anthony from

2257
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,480
doing a free event to support and raise

2258
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,639
money for the community we have every

2259
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,080
right to set the record straight and to

2260
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,960
defend the truth with facts and evidence

2261
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,119
and to defend the chronically ill

2262
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:28,600
against the icious attacks of this group

2263
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:31,600
and we are going to continue to do so we

2264
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:33,960
expect the plotters to evade and ignore

2265
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,960
what they have done wrong we expect them

2266
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:39,159
to continue to lie and spread falsities

2267
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,040
we expect them to Pivot onto something

2268
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:45,199
new they'll make up and we expect them

2269
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:47,639
to skew and alter data and to hide

2270
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:50,480
critical pieces of evidence that

2271
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:52,719
undermines their entire campaign we also

2272
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,199
expect the plotters to fabricate

2273
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:56,400
explanation

2274
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:58,920
as they do everything they can to try to

2275
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:03,199
discredit what we're exposing them for

2276
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:05,679
having done and said in their own words

2277
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:09,480
but we are using their own text messages

2278
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:12,320
voice messages social media posts words

2279
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:14,760
that they spoke on recorded calls and

2280
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,920
other published materials there's no use

2281
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:21,239
of any AI in any of these episodes and

2282
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:23,719
never will be all of the information was

2283
