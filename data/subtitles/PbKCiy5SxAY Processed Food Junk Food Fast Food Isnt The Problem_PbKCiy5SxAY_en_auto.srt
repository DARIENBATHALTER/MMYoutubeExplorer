40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,159
what about all the neurological problems

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
and autoimmune diagnoses in a 15 year

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
old what about all the neurological

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880

in a 21 year old is it really years and

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,600
years of fast foods when you're they're

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
not 50 years old

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,320
is it really really the fast foods and

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,840
the processed foods

that's creating that

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,160
so let's get a few things straight

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,239
junk food fast food processed food

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,080
yeah it's bad for you

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
why is it bad for you we're gonna cover

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
a little bit but yeah it's bad for you

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
it's true

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
it's bad

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,200
absolutely

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,800
yes it'll contribute to obesity it will

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,640
contribute to heart attack

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,760
your heart attack

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
it will contribute to cardiovascular

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
problems

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,000
it will contribute to diabetes right

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,720
type 2 diabetes it will make you

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
diabetic over time

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
okay

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,280
it can contribute to that

70
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,920
yeah all that grease and all that

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,840
processed oil and all that fried oil oil

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
and all that junk and everything else

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
and right

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
all that we dump inside of us fast foods

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
and processed foods and all that sure

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
it's going to bring us closer to obesity

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
it's going to bring us closer to a heart

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,879
attack that's why i always say butter

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
butter's like the heart attacker

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
butter

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,120
that's the heart attack bringer

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,000
right

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,400
but what about the raging

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,959
raging illnesses happening and the

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
autoimmune and the fatigue and the

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,840
seeing and that and the chronic fatigue

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
syndrome the

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,360
mecfs and the fibro and the hoshi so

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
wait a minute

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
fast food

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
gives you hoshis

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
what gives you hashimoto's is it fast

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,799
food that gives you hashimoto's

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
so

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
this is an important conversation

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,159
because i know in the health scene

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
i know for quite a while now in the last

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,599
10 years

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
all these people these brainiacs these

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,680
geniuses coming up in the health scene

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
feel like they found they found it all

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
they figured it all out

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,680
it's

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,120
all that fast food it's all the

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
processed food

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
it's going into the fast food

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,959
restaurants that's what's killing us all

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
that's what's doing it it's all that so

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,159
let's go we'll make some documentary

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
that oh we'll go and do we'll do this

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
about it oh we'll go and put some books

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,840
out about it

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
without even understanding why anybody

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,240
gets sick without even understanding our

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,600
knowing why or how anyone gets sick

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
anyone

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
young people get sick

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,479
right

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
how much fast food is someone eating by

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,080
the time they're nine years old

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
meanwhile they got thyroid diagnoses at

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,000
nine years old

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,639
they are crippling fatigue and brain fog

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,520
at nine years old they got crippling

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,160
eczema and psoriasis at nine years old

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,880
so what is it the 50 years of fast foods

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,120
and nine year olds nine years old

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,800
what is it the 50 years of processed

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,880
food that's what got the nine-year-old

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
sick 50 years does that make any sense

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
50 years of processed foods and fast

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,800
foods and greasy fried foods

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
and that's what made a nine-year-old

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
sick when nine-year-olds only nine years

135
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
old

136
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,120
norma said study just came out linking

137
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,840
ms to ebv and you've been saying this

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,320
all along published first medical medium

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,880
that's medical medium information public

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,600
published first and then science

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,360
poaches and steals medical medium

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
information

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
that's what they do

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
that's how they learn science and

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
chronic illness now they they go to the

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
medical medium books into the medical

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
medium lectures and all the medical

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
medium

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
work that's been done and they take the

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
information they extract it and they try

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,160
to advance forward with that

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
in certain areas

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
but don't worry they'll just be shut

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
down

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
down the road when they link that then

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,759
they'll be classified medical research

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,960
and science will stomp on them

158
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,280
like they were a turkey in thanksgiving

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,120
it'll just stomp on them

160
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,039
you know that's the one thing even if

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,120
they try even if alternative science or

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,440
conventional science takes medical

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
medium information about epstein-barr

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,840
causing multiple sclerosis which is

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
which is medical medium right and they

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,160
take that and they try to now do studies

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,080
to try to link it right

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
big bad wolf

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,360
up in the sky classified medical

170
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,199
research and science will jump on them

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
so quick and pounce on them and eat them

172
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,080
up

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,479
because they don't want that getting out

174
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,280
there so it's kind of a battle out there

175
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,800
and how that works

176
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,720
so what's making the eight year old

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,720
so sick they got thyroid disorders at

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
eight years old is it 50 years of

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
processed foods

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
no

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
they're eight years old

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,520
what's making the five-year-old get

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,319
raging eczema psoriasis is it 60 years

184
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,440
of processed food

185
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
and fast food and greasy food no

186
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
no

187
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
i love it documentaries on fast foods

188
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,800
and

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
and fried greasy foods and processed

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,199
foods all these things on that everybody

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,639

going to do it'll clog up that liver so

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
let's take a look

255
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
the more and more grease you stick in

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
you and the more and more fried

257
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
processed oil and grease you stick in

258
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,120
you okay

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
the more and more your liver has to get

260
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
overburdened overburdened overburdened

261
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,040
you kill your liver with that

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,000
well what that does that just leads

263
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,519
people to the obesity factor the weight

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,760
gain comes on because their liver is

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
being bogged down by all that grease and

266
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,519
all that that processed food right and

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,200
all that fast food okay and then once

268
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,040
that liver gets beaten down like that

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
you end up with type 2 diabetes now

270
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
you're pre-diabetic yes

271
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
and then

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
all that fat from those processed foods

273
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
and fried greasy foods starts to cling

274
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,519
to your arteries and your veins and

275
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,519
cling to your heart starts to get into

276
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,279
your heart right there right

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,560
and your valves

278
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,800
gets into the veins and arteries right

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,480
and so guess what yeah

280
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
you end up

281
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
gaining weight you end up

282
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,320
heart attack city down the road when

283
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,000
you're older

284
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,240

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800

286
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,279

317
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,959
i'm excited we're talking about

318
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,480
processed foods and we're going to go

319
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,480
deeper into it we got more to cover

320
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,480
cooked food actually some of the

321
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
minerals are cooked out and they can

322
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
cause the body to need some of its

323
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,079
minerals to simulate

324
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
my tongue gets dry with cooked foods

325
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,720
so

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,600
what happens with cooked foods is it's

327
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
like this right

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
you gotta realize where you're coming

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,519
from okay you can do like three six nine

330
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
and be all raw you can do the 369

331
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
advance and do all raw you can just go

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,560
that way you can use that protocol and

333
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,720
be all raw you can do the 28 day cleanse

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
medical medium new edition and go all

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,639
raw

336
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
right you can do that okay

337
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,279
there's a lot of people though they have

338
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,760
a difficulty difficult time going raw

339
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
and going raw

340
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,720
doesn't mean you're still going to get

341
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
better

342
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,600
like medical medium information like the

343
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,279
28 day cleanse or the 369 advance

344
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
they're raw

345
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
but they're raw designed in a specific

346
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,200
way to take somebody to where they need

347
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
to go take them to a finish line of

348
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,600
healing right but you can still heal

349
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,480
eating cooked

350
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
and you can still heal eating cooked

351
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
all the way

352
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
that's why the banana mono cleanses a

353
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
raw cleanse right in the medical medium

354
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
cleanse the heel book but there's also a

355
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,320
potato

356
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,279
mono cleanse which is your steaming

357
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
potatoes and you're actually able to go

358
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
all the way to on that level with

359
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,240
steamed potatoes

360
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
you don't lose minerals with cooked food

361
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
what happens is the reason why you feel

362
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,880
dried out with cooked food and you feel

363
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,560
dried out like that the reason why you

364
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,839
feel that way

365
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,160
is because

366
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,680
nerves that's a nerve thing so your

367
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,440
tongue can be dried out your mouth can

368
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,920
feel dried out you can feel dried out

369
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
overall when you're doing cooked

370
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
because the nervous system that means

371
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,720
there's a nervous system sensitivity

372
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
happening that's what that is

373
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,880
and

374
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,800
so so cooked food in general can

375
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
rub a certain way

376
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
on the tongue

377
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,880
and that's your vagus nerve all of that

378
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,399
your mouth your throat

379
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
it all depends on what's happening if

380
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
you have sensitive vagus nerve issues on

381
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
any level even if it's just sensitive

382
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
digestion sensitive vagus nerves what's

383
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
that whatever

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
cooked food can feel differently and it

385
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,519
all depends on what the cooked food is

386
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,360
too like what the cooked food is but

387
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
that's interesting i mean i'm glad

388
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
you're raw and you're doing raw that's

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,320
amazing

390
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,199
all raw is not the answer though meaning

391
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
any just raw is not the answer so i know

392
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
we're talking about processed foods and

393
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
everything else but it's interesting to

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,279
talk about this too

395
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
is that there's raw diets out there that

396
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,360
are high fat

397
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
and a high fat raw diet

398
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,839
still

399
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,279
can bring you

400
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,839
down on your knees sick and not healing

401
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,880
where you're like oh my god i'm all raw

402
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,480
i'm doing everything i can i found this

403
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,480
raw diet out there and i'm still sick

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,720
and i can't get better and i'm still

405
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
fatigued and i still have skin problems

406
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
and what is it

407
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,600
meanwhile you're tanking the nut butters

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
and you're taking all the oils and

409
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,519
you're taking the avocado too much and

410
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
you're taking more nut butters

411
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,079
and then you're doing more oil then

412
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,160
you're doing

413
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,440
more avocado and then you're doing

414
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,440
something else and yeah you're all raw

415
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,680
and then you're doing the olive oil hey

416
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,560
i got this great raw coconut oil and

417
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,399
you're doing all these oils and fats and

418
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
then you're just stuck still it happens

419
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,519
to so many people and then they get

420
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,600
stuck

421
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,279
you can heal doing cooked food you can

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,839
try that protocol and heal you and cook

423
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,279
food you can heal doing raw food as long

424
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,880
as you know what you're doing though it

425
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,399
all matters the details matter you can't

426
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,279
just be raw and that's the answer i

427
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,279
thought oats were inflammatory

428
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
oats are not

429
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,839
a food

430
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,680
that's like a healing food

431
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,959
but oats are not a herding food

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,800
so they're not a herding food oats

433
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,639
don't feed viruses

434
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,199
see that's important to know so oats

435
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,639
don't feed viruses

436
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,360
and viruses are inflammatory so that's

437
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,639
important to know right there

438
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,560
oats and millet are two

439
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,320
grains right there that medical medium

440
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,320
information says you can eat but it

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,880
doesn't mean you have to if you don't

442
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
want to do oats like in the protocols in

443
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
the book there's so many different

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
avenues like there's no there's no mono

445
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,079
oatmeal

446
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,519
diet in the medical medium book

447
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,880
for a reason

448
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,040
right

449
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,440
and oats aren't in the 369 cleanse right

450
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,000
meaning like the advanced cleanse

451
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,000
but oats are kind of like a filler do

452
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
they have nutrition in them yeah they

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,519
have nutrients in them okay but the key

454
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,440
thing about oats all right is oats don't

455
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,800
feed viruses viruses are why everybody's

456
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,079
inflamed

457
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,839
right and oats don't feed the viruses

458
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,519
so that gets them inflamed it's

459
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,240
important to know they're not an

460
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,800
inflammatory food

461
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,320
so they're not an inflammation producing

462
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,880
food

463
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,199
but gluten is make sure gluten-free oats

464
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,639
that's important to know there too

465
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
so let's start making this and we'll get

466
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
them in the oven and we'll talk more

467
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,079
about what's happening it's good to see

468
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,039
you guys it's an honor to be here so

469
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,439
what i'm gonna do is mash up two bananas

470
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,720
it's the first thing i'm gonna do

471
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,199
let's throw a couple of bananas in here

472
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
and

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,559
see that couple bananas

474
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
every time

475
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
somebody gets an epiphany right in the

476
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,760
healing movement say a doctor or

477
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,679
something they want to start a podcast

478
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
they want to write a book they want to

479
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,799
start teaching they want to start

480
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
lecturing about health foods or health

481
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,720
healthy living and all that they get

482
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,600
this epiphany where

483
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,799
they want to lose some weight

484
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,720
they want to do better things for others

485
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,320
they are in conventional medicine they

486
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
want to back down off of conventional

487
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,520
medicine a little bit and they want to

488
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,559
head to a place of like an awakening

489
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,760
happens

490
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
wow

491
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,679
fast food and greasy foods and fried

492
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
foods and processed foods that's the

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
problem all this time

494
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
that's what it is

495
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
or it's the lectins and oxalates in all

496
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,240
these foods

497
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,480
or it's bad foods like fast foods and

498
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
some other food issues too but they get

499
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,559
wrapped up into this whole thing like i

500
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,919
found the answer i got the light bulb i

501
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,600
got the answer

502
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,679
everybody's sick because they're eating

503
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,240
bad

504
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,039
do you see how it goes you guys

505
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
anybody jumping into the health scene

506
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,760
green

507
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
green

508
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
jumps in like

509
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
oh my god

510
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
i figured it out

511
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,039
all these years of just doing my normal

512
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
stuff going into medical school and out

513
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,120
of medical school eating what i wanted

514
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,640
drinking alcohol on the weekends all

515
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,240
these years i figured it out because i'm

516
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,320
starting to gain a little weight around

517
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
my waist and as a doctor i started

518
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,400
figuring it out you can't have processed

519
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,720
foods all those people are bad at the

520
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,480
fast food restaurant line you guys are

521
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,919
all eating fast foods that's the whole

522
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
thing and they have this epiphany this

523
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,360
awakening like oh they discovered

524
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,360
everything they discovered it

525
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,880
then they start telling their patients

526
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,320
shouldn't be eating fast foods and then

527
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,240
they want to write a book let's write a

528
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
book and make sure we talk about how all

529
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
these greasy foods are killing americans

530
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,799
or killing europeans or killing whoever

531
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,640
around the world right

532
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,000
and they think i'm mashing two bananas

533
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,799
in here because i'm making these oatmeal

534
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,799
cookies right now

535
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,280
and then they think they discovered the

536
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,280
holy grail

537
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,840
they actually discovered atlantis

538
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
the lost city of atlantis

539
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
they discovered it

540
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
they figured it out after all these

541
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
years everybody's sick because

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,799
they're just eating all this junk food

543
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
and fast food and processed food that's

544
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,320
why everybody's sick

545
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,160
we just we just figured it out

546
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,200
right

547
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,799
and

548
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,240
real i'm gonna put some cinnamon in here

549
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,320
too

550
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320
okay a little bit of cinnamon in this

551
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,559
i'm gonna put a little bit of maple

552
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,120
syrup in here too if you guys don't mind

553
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,679
robin says what's the difference

554
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,600
between gluten-free oats regular ones

555
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
what makes oats gluten-free

556
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,159
processing is the big one

557
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,559
okay so processing is a really big one

558
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
the processing right the facility

559
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,799
i'm going to put a little maple syrup in

560
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
here facilities that are also churning

561
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,760
out wheat

562
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
germ

563
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,039
they're churning wheat germ out

564
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,559

566
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,280
germ

567
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
um

568
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,840
bagels

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
bagels

570
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
loaves of bread

571
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,679
loaves loaves of processed bread white

572
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
bread right they're churning all this

573
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,880
out

574
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,280
and then also they're going to run some

575
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
oats through the machine well we ran

576
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,120
oats through the machine after we just

577
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,200
ran all the those breadcrumbs those

578
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,679
white breadcrumbs to the machine and now

579
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,080
we're packaging up oats oh oats are

580
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
gluten free right

581
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,440
christina says won't oatmeal bananas and

582
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,679
maple syrup spike your insulin a lot

583
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
well that's

584
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,799
that's what people believe

585
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
so let's go into that you just you just

586
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,159
you just

587
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
set the pace for a good diabetic talk

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
for a couple of seconds including

589
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,960
hypoglycemia and other issues like that

590
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,200
blood sugar issues let's just throw some

591
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,360
raisins in here i'm gonna be spiking my

592
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,640
blood sugar i'm gonna be spiking my

593
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,400
blood sugar really bad right here

594
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,280
this is gonna throw me into major

595
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,799
diabetic like coma

596
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,919
or something

597
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,840

that should be good i'm gonna put some

599
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,400
so let's go into that

600
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,080
sugar

601
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,039
doesn't create insulin resistance

602
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
sugar

603
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,559
carbohydrates does not create insulin

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,360
resistance it's fat so i'm looking for

605
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,400
the fat here where's the fat

606
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
where is it

607
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
fat are you in there

608
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
where are you

609
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,520
where's the oils

610
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,360
where's all the oils where's the fat

611
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,200
where's the olive oil

612
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,039
where's the coconut oil

613
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,559
where's the nut butter where's the nuts

614
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,640
where are you guys

615
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,360
how come you're not here

616
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
are you guys in here where are you

617
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
huh

618
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,480
hey wait

619
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,600
i can't find you

620
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,880
so all i'm seeing is oats raisins

621
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,679
bananas

622
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,480
and cinnamon and maple syrup

623
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,760
i'm not seeing any fats

624
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,760
this can't spike your insulin

625
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,640
this can't jack up your a1c

626
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,080
this doesn't create diabetes

627
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,240
okay

628
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,440
very important to know

629
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,919
what this does is this helps to fix

630
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,400
those problems because guess what's

631
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,320
missing out of here there's no oils

632
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
there's no nut butters there's no fats

633
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,480
there's no grease there's no lard

634
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,480
there's no crisco there's no nothing in

635
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
here

636
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,720
very important now

637
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,320
okay so i'm gonna go with a couple of

638
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,840
cups

639
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,840
see a couple cups of oats here

640
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,559
a little measurement

641
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,559
just one cup there

642
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,360
go with another cup

643
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
roughly

644
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
i think that might be good see what we

645
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
got

646
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,320
all right

647
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,000
this is important to know right here

648
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,240
okay you guys critical point

649
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,279
when you eat fat

650
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,559
which i call radical fats right

651
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,240
when you eat the nut butter i'm not

652
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,080
saying nut butters are bad for you i'm

653
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
not saying avocado is bad for you i'm

654
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,559
not saying healthy fats are bad for you

655
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,520
i'm just saying that when you have fat

656
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,480
even when it's chicken or meat or nut

657
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,080
butters or oils or anything like that

658
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,279
when you eat the fat it stops sugar from

659
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,760
entering your cells

660
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,240
it holds up the insulin the insulin just

661
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,440
gets all caught up in the bloodstream it

662
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,840
can't get sugar into your cells

663
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,480
it's the fat that's doing it it's not

664
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,480
the sugar

665
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,480
this is a really important time for some

666
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,640
of you guys

667
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,799
that have been brainwashed about the

668
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
whole sugar thing and the whole diabetic

669
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
thing in the whole in the whole you know

670
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,400
hypoglycemic thing and the whole

671
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,880
hypersonic hyperside

672
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,480
heart glycemic thing sorry it's

673
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,760
you just need to know this is like an

674
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,240
awakening moment right here because

675
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,840
wait a minute it's not the sugar what

676
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
are you saying like what are you even

677
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,480
talking about it's not the sugar

678
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
no it's not

679
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,200
it's not the sugar at all i'm going to

680
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,200
add a little bit more oatmeal to this

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,440
ice cream

682
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
jacks up that blood sugar

683
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,799
ice cream's the a1c nightmare ice cream

684
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
is the diabetic nightmare i don't care

685
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,760
if it's coconut ice cream i don't care

686
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,000
if it's vegan ice cream i don't care if

687
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,559
it's planet mars ice cream i don't care

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,240
if an alien ship

689
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,240
arrived from pluto

690
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,840
and dropped off

691
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
a new batch of ice cream for everybody

692
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
that ice cream is sugar and fat combined

693
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
and when that ice cream is sugar and fat

694
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,760
combined you got the diabetic nightmare

695
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
you got the blood sugar nightmare you

696
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,360
got the insulin resistance nightmare

697
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,400
and that's why everybody on the

698
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,760
processed foods eventually gets the a1c

699
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,039
and the diabetic nightmare and

700
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,880
everything else

701
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,960
that's why the processed food thing the

702
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559
fast food the greasy fried food that's

703
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,640

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
professionals or genius health

706
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,679
influencers when they get that epiphany

707
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,840
in awakening and they're like i'm not

708
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,159

treat you know it's a treat i know so

753
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,279
many people

754
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,919
are just they're they're like

755
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,880

757
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,399
the healthy junk food out there and that

758
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,000
that's not what this is this isn't junk

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,480
food right

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,240
but they're they're trapped because all

761
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
of a sudden they'll give in to something

762
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,520

so when someone has als

822
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
right

823
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,799
is it because of processed foods

824
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,799
then

825
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,559
how can how come somebody else who had

826
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,799
processed foods all these years didn't

827
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,799
get als just curious

828
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,960
if someone has

829
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
alzheimer's

830
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,159
dementia

831
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
right is it because of the fast foods

832
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,360
and the greasy foods and the fried foods

833
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,960
they had all these years what about the

834
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,480
other person who didn't get alzheimer's

835
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,760
dementia

836
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
and they've been eating the fast foods

837
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,399
processed foods and greasy foods all

838
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,640
these years

839
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,120
what about that

840
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,799
what about the person right

841
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,120
who has crippling depression

842
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,880
suicidal thoughts they don't want to be

843
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,760
here anymore

844
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,279
they're suffering and agony

845
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,960
and they've been eating processed foods

846
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,399
and fast foods and greasy foods but what

847
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,000
about the other person who's been eating

848
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,200
fast food processed foods greasy foods

849
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,519
but they don't have the crippling

850
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,039
depression on a level

851
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,880
or that they're in that condition

852
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,799
so you know when this whole epiphany

853
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
happens to like a health professional

854
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,519
where they wake up one morning and

855
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,320
they're like whoa it's the processed

856
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,399
foods doing it

857
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,760

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,799
everybody just went to the library and

868
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,880
i want people to have the book

869
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,240
so when we have this whole thing happen

870
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
in the world of health and i've watched

871
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,240
it for years

872
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
i've watched these awakenings happen in

873
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,480
health professionals for years

874
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,519
where they think they have now all the

875
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,760
answers so they start there

876
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,360
but it's way more complicated than that

877
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,360
it's way more in depth than that it's

878
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,279
way more

879
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,600
important to know what's really

880
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,039
happening there's so much more people

881
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,480
don't know

882
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
so why do we get that crippling

883
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,880
depression we get it because of toxic

884
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,039
heavy metals in the brain why do we get

885
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,760
that crippling als because we get toxic

886
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,519
heavy metals in the brain plus viruses

887
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,679
why do we get multiple sclerosis because

888
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,360
of epstein-barr virus

889
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,480
also people with multiple sclerosis are

890
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,000
high in mercury and epstein-barr right

891
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,399
we get these other problems because of

892
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,480
these reasons and yes fast foods

893
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,000
processed foods and and

894
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
and

895
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,840
junk foods are not helpful on any level

896
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,760
but it's not solely the problem and

897
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,880
let's go into that a little bit why can

898
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,120
someone eat all that junk for years and

899
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,880
then they get their heart attack

900
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,720
when they're 50 or 55 they get their

901
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,960
heart attack when they're 60

902
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,040
but then someone else

903
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,240
right

904
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
someone else

905
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
got sick with something else

906
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,960
what's going on there right when someone

907
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,800
didn't get sick with something else and

908
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
they have this heart attack later on

909
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,560
like how does that happen so let's cut

910
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,000
into it and let's go into it

911
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,839
right now

912
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,440
what you're going to see is neurological

913
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,440
problems on the rise more than ever

914
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,119
before in history it already is and has

915
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,639
been i've been talking about this for 35

916
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,000
years but we're at a place where

917
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,760
neurological problems are going to

918
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,040
dominate in such a way that no one can

919
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
even imagine

920
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,079
so it's not just depression anxiety and

921
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
ocd

922
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
and all that all the mental health

923

complications that people suffer from

925
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,599
but it's gonna be the fatigue the muscle

926
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,000
weakness the dizziness more than ever

927
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,480

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,560
all this times a million it's just going

934
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,920
to be all this times 10 million all this

935
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,200
times a billion is what it's going to be

936
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,760
and it's not because of a processed food

937
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,079
so what do we have to look out for or

938
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,240
worry about it's viruses

939
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,079
and bacteria

940
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,960
toxic heavy metals poisons right

941
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,960
so

942
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,160
i i saw the other day

943
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,839
right a friend of mine showed me

944
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,160
something and said look this this really

945
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,079
smart doctor guy who writes a book said

946
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,599
it's radiation in the airports we got to

947
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,960
look out for well that's medical medium

948
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,320
information i'm the only one that talked

949
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,960
about all the radiation in the airports

950
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,119
for years and years and years so okay

951
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,280
great and he's saying that's the problem

952
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,200
like that's not the problem

953
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,440
that's a contributor

954
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,400
that that's a trigger but that's not the

955
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,599
problem it's amazing how we can just we

956
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,599
it's what we attach ourselves to right

957
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
it's what our psyche kind of gravitate

958
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,359
gravitates to it's like if someone's

959
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
like totally gets jazzed up on whoa it's

960
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,359
the processed food whoa it's that then

961
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,359
that's got to be the answer it's a fast

962
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,359
food then that's what they're all into

963
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,280
right or whoa you're right there's

964
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,960
radiation in the airport that's what

965
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
it's got to be it's the radiation in the

966
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
airport and they get attached to that

967
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,760
they're like whoa that's it

968
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,680
but it's just more than this

969
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,160
you can take someone

970
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,160
who gets radiated

971
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,960
they breathe in all these fragrances and

972
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,599
candles and clones of perfumes

973
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,839
they get exposed to pesticides

974
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,359
insecticides

975
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,040
right

976
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,680
and they still

977
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,280
stay okay for a while they still stay

978
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,359
okay for a while and then you get

979
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,599
somebody else that breathes in a little

980
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,920
bit of pesticide breathes in some

981
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,599
scented candles freeze in a little bit

982
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,599
of mold somewhere and they go down

983
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,680
because you have to have the pathogens

984
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
internally

985
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,720
you have to have the pathogens

986
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
internally

987
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,760
they have to be there

988
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,079
and that's why people got the

989
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,880
hashimoto's and hyperthyroidism and they

990
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,800
got the cysts and nodules on the thyroid

991
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,960
and that's why they got the fatigue and

992
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,079
that's why they got the cfs

993
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,839
and that's why they have the skin

994
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,560
disorders and the excellent psoriasis

995
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,880
you have to have the pathogen somewhere

996
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,359
that's advanced information you have to

997
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,079
have the viruses the epstein bars the h

998
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,800
the hsv1 hsb2 you got the shingles you

999
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,960
got to have the hhv6 cytomegalovirus you

1000
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,800
have to have the pathogens and viruses

1001
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,119
is what you need

1002
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,040
can be hard said sounds like lime and

1003
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,520
bartonella bartonel is not a lyme

1004
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,400
problem barnell is what you've been told

1005
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,839
a long time ago is is a cause of lyme

1006
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,880
it's not neurological lyme is is viral

1007
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,480
so that's

1008
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
the viruses and maybe that's what you

1009
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,880
were leading to

1010
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,839
it's what you're alluding to with that

1011
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,359
right barnell is not superbug barnella

1012
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,760
doesn't create

1013
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,000
doesn't create neurological symptoms

1014
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
right burnell is a bacteria that doesn't

1015
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,680
create bacteria doesn't create

1016
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,440
neurological symptoms very important to

1017
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,880
know i talk about that in the books like

1018
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,079
if you go into the lyme section of

1019
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,560
cleanse of heal you'll see that

1020
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,960
so neurological problems are caused by

1021
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,920
neurotoxins produced by viruses

1022
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,880
and that's how it's done

1023
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,359
barnella is not as strong as mrsa

1024
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,400
but people can kick mrsa

1025
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,480
right merce is a superbug

1026
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,320
created by

1027
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,440
um classified medical research and

1028
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,839
science

1029
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,400
deliberately put into hospitals

1030
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,200
just so you know

1031
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,839
mrs a super bug

1032
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,920
and they can still kill mrsa off people

1033
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,839
have a better recovery rate with mrsa

1034
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,200
than bartonella

1035
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,280
so you got all these people with

1036
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,560
neurological lyme suffering

1037
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,040
and they can't get rid of this

1038
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,119
bartonella barnella dies instantly with

1039
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,040
penicillin

1040
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,800
with penicillin

1041
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,760
i'm not talking about all these other

1042
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,400
design crafted antibiotics

1043
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,880
that they have to use for super bugs

1044
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,359
barnella dies with penicillin never mind

1045
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,000
doxy or anything else

1046
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,000
and bartonel is not the cause of lyme

1047
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
so that's important to know the cause of

1048
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,640
lyme disease

1049
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,960
is something that creates neurological

1050
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,480
symptoms bacteria doesn't create

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,480
neurological symptoms

1052
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,200
lisa says burnell is a virus

1053
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,480
and mrsa is a bacteria

1054
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
well

1055
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
for

1056
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,520
25 years they've been saying

1057
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,800
bartonella's a bacteria so maybe they

1058
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,240
flipped it

1059
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,520
because they don't know what is what

1060
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,240
anymore so but barnell is bacteria

1061
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,880
borrelia's bacteria babies is a hybrid

1062
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,040
in bacteria and merce is a bacteria

1063
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,119
i don't know what else to tell you

1064
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,040
and those bacteria aren't why people are

1065
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,079
sick with neurological lyme or lyme

1066
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,240
disease

1067
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,079
that's why they've been antibiotic to

1068
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,560
death for years and decades and decades

1069
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,040
people lost their lives from antibiotics

1070
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,040
because they were told it was bartonella

1071
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,359
people's lives were destroyed and ruined

1072
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,200
because of that

1073
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,680
if you want to have some compassion for

1074
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,160
people out there that lost their lives

1075
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,400
from being antibiotic to death

1076
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,960
for bartonella and babisia and borrelia

1077
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
then that's one place to go because

1078
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,079
that's where i go all the time because i

1079
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,920
feel horrible for people who lost their

1080
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,119
lives from that

1081
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,880
i can't tell you how many people walk

1082
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,480
through the door in my office and how

1083
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,680
many lime doctors called me up at my

1084
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,200
office throughout the last 35 years

1085
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,480
and they learned the truth about what

1086
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
caused neurological lyme and they're

1087
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,680
like so what do we do i said we need

1088
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,680
your lysine

1089
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,280
you have to have your zinc

1090
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,200
you have to have your antivirals you

1091
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,560
have to have your licorice root

1092
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,079
and all of a sudden the neurological

1093
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,760
line you have to have your cat cat's

1094
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,200
claw and all of a sudden the

1095
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,880
neurological lyme patients we're all

1096
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,920
getting better at these doctor's offices

1097
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
and they're like oh my god this is

1098
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,280
unbelievable because we've been

1099
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,960
antibiotic doing the antibiotic thing

1100
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,720
with our patients over and over and over

1101
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,960
again because we keep on thinking they

1102
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,560
have borrelia and bartonella

1103
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,160
they don't

1104
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,359
and if you want to learn more about that

1105
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,079
just so you know

1106
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,480
they never see bartonella

1107
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,079
and they never see borrelia if you read

1108
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,839
about lyme disease you'll learn how the

1109
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,920
lyme labs work

1110
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,760
they don't see bartonella so here you

1111
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,680
are be like here you'll be like and

1112
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,040
listen this is no disrespect i i've a

1113
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,920
lot of respect for you for being here

1114
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,240
talking about this this is a great topic

1115
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,800
what people don't realize is at the lime

1116
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,800
lab they never see bartonella they don't

1117
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,200
see it did you know that

1118
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,200
they don't see it under a microscope nor

1119
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,040
do they see borrelia when you get your

1120
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,359
blood sent to

1121
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,160
the lab

1122
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,880
they just test for an inflammatory

1123
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,720
marker and they plug in the name

1124
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,800
they put the name in

1125
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,800
it's the biggest scam

1126
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,560
ever in our history

1127
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,720
probably one of the biggest scams in our

1128
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,680
history pretty pretty incredible really

1129
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,680
checking the cookies you guys

1130
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,040
cookies aren't done yet

1131
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,880
when you get your blood tested at a lyme

1132
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,920
lab they're just doing an inflammatory

1133
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,640
test

1134
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,119
it's kind of like an a a

1135
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,319
it's a c-reactive protein

1136
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,000
okay very important to know

1137
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,240
so and

1138
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
that's the trick of the trade so the

1139
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,079
lyme disease labs never see

1140
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,880
they never see your bartonelli your

1141
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,880
borrelia your your your lovisia they

1142
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,040
never see any of that

1143
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,200
that's what's sad about it it's been a

1144
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,119
scam running for a long time and a lot

1145
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,960
of people lost their lives over it now

1146
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,440
but you know what's funny

1147
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,960
and amazing now there's lime doctors now

1148
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,880
using protocols using medical medium

1149
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
protocols right but they're plugging in

1150
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
the cats cloud they're lowering the

1151
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,200
antibiotics and they're getting people

1152
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,240
some results first time in history

1153
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,079
because they're using medical bean

1154
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,920
protocols i taught about this for years

1155
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,079
i talked to dozens and dozens of lyme

1156
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,760
doctors all through the east coast all

1157
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,920
through the country

1158
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,359
and i got the lyme doctors to test for

1159
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,359
epstein-barr and what the lyme doctors

1160
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,359
were doing they're like oh my god

1161
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,520
this patient has epstein barr

1162
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,839
anthony william was right

1163
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,359
i think we're on to something eureka

1164
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,560
we're onto something

1165
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,240
why do you think

1166
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,079
they talk about anybody with lyme

1167
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,599
disease now that goes like public with

1168
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,200
it that might be like a big public

1169
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,319
figure or a celebrity and they talk

1170
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,000
about their lyme disease why do you

1171
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,520
think they say i have lyme disease and

1172
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
epstein-barr

1173
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,960
that's kind of funny

1174
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
which you really have is epstein-barr

1175
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,440
and that's what's causing your

1176
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,119
neurological symptoms and what are those

1177
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,079
neurological symptoms tingles and

1178
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,440
numbness fatigue brain fog don't feel

1179
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,520
good

1180
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,599
yeah that's your ebv

1181
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,000
that's your ebv

1182
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,040
antibiotics ruined my gut

1183
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,200
kristen i feel for you truly i've seen

1184
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,839
antibiotics kill people

1185
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,040
for years and years and years with lyme

1186
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,200
disease

1187
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,359
they get so weak and here's the thing

1188
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,359
too okay they get so weak

1189
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,880
and the sicker they get

1190
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,880
they take more blood the sicker they get

1191
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,440
they take more blood and that's how a

1192
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,880
lyme disease patient dies

1193
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,599
they die

1194
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,000
from

1195
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,200
getting blood tests

1196
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,319
faster

1197
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,720
and more vials and faster and more vials

1198
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,000
and more in between and more in between

1199
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,319
meaning

1200
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,319
one week apart one week apart one week

1201
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,560
apart two weeks apart one week apart

1202
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,280
let's take 27 more vials let's take 30

1203
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,839
vials let's take 40 vials let's take you

1204
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,280
know let's take 50 vials right

1205
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,400
and that's what they do

1206
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,240
so they're just

1207
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,079
taking blood let's give you more

1208
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,599
antibiotics oh you don't feel good well

1209
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,520
it's not the antibiotic that's that's

1210
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,800
making you not feel good something else

1211
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,359
is wrong we're going to keep on taking

1212
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,839
more blood from you this is how tens of

1213
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,400
thousands of lyme patients died in the

1214
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,920
last 40 years it's from all the blood

1215
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,599
taken

1216
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,560
and the game

1217
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,920
the chase for phantom bacteria

1218
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,720
when really they were viral if they had

1219
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,280
less blood drawn and they had a viral

1220
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,760
protocol like in cleanse to heal

1221
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,079
they would still be here now

1222
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,359
and thank god enough people got to me in

1223
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,440
my office throughout the years that

1224
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,280
enough doctors talk to me to save enough

1225
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,119
people with neurological life and that's

1226
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,480
why you see the world of lyme disease

1227
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,760
changed right now because the medical

1228
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,359
medium work

1229
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,040
that's why you see cats claw in the

1230
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,200
protocols that's why you see them lower

1231
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,079
the antibiotics

1232
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,079
it's important to know

1233
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
i'm gonna check out these cookies hold

1234
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,760
on you guys

1235
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,319
they're getting there

1236
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,480
so

1237
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,400
i just want to let everybody know

1238
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,319

o'clock pacific i'm gonna be exclusive

1240
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,880
there talking about something different

1241
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
a different topic

1242
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
we're not gonna be talking about lyme

1243
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,520
disease we're not gonna be talking about

1244
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,920
processed foods but this is good stuff

1245
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,040
we're talking about now i'm excited

1246
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,920
so let's

1247
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,720
go a little bit longer

1248
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
have some more fun

1249
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,839
where can we get tested for ebv

1250
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,640
with a family physician you just ask

1251
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,040
your doctor for an fc bar test

1252
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,480
that's that's a great way to start

1253
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,880
said nadine that's what you can do you

1254
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,040
can actually start that way

1255
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,119
you just ask for it

1256
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,040
that's that's what you can do

1257
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,560
family physician should be able to write

1258
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,599
that one up

1259
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,000
they can they can write that

1260
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,720
prescription for that blood test up

1261
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,119
okay have them test for past and present

1262
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,760
infection so keep that in mind past and

1263
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,079
present infection past infection means

1264
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,599
you still have epstein-barr

1265
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,400
so that'll give you the answer right

1266
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,119
there

1267
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,319
so test for past and present

1268
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,160
infection that's important right there

1269
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,839
in medical medium book one which is the

1270
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,200
new addition now when that hit the scene

1271
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,960
it broke the news about what

1272
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,359
epstein-barr caused it causes all these

1273
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
neurological symptoms it's not the fast

1274
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,280
foods it's not the processed foods and

1275
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,240
the junk foods

1276
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,920
what about having lyme and ms

1277
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,079
well if you read in the cleanse of heal

1278
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,480
books you'll see that multiple sclerosis

1279
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,079
is caused by epstein-barr and mercury

1280
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,720
and you'll see that neurological lyme is

1281
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,160
also viral too which sepsis and bar

1282
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,440
a lot of people have one or two

1283
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,200
varieties of epstein-barr they'll have a

1284
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,119
shingles virus too

1285
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,800
and they'll be high in mercury as well

1286
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,559
mercury is hard to test for it because

1287
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,480
with mercury it doesn't mean it's in

1288
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,559
your bloodstream it's in the organs it

1289
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,559
could be all in the organs so you can't

1290
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,960
you can't get a good accurate test

1291
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,720
through the blood because of that

1292
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,760
when it's sitting inside organs it's

1293
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,520
hard to actually get a test

1294
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,760
so

1295
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,839
basically it's like this if someone

1296
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,680
didn't have a

1297
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:10,240
pathogen they can eat all the fast food

1298
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,680
they want all the junk food they want

1299
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,200
all the processed food they want until

1300
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,800
they get their heart attack

1301
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,240
or their diabetes

1302
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,240
or their hypertension into a heart

1303
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,599
attack

1304
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,160
important now if someone does it or a

1305
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,960
stroke if someone doesn't have

1306
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,200
if someone doesn't have the viruses in

1307
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,200
them

1308
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,640
they can spend a lifetime of processed

1309
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,559
junk food they can be pulling up to the

1310
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,960
fast food restaurant every day give me a

1311
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,960
double bacon cheeseburger please

1312
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,359
i'll take another pizza give me a bacon

1313
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,240
double cheese dog give me a bunch of

1314
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,800
onion rings give me some fries with with

1315
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,200
bacon bits on top bacon give me more

1316
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,200
bacon

1317
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,880
and they can do that for year after year

1318
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,119
after year until

1319
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,240
they drop dead

1320
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,359
until that artery gets clogged until

1321
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,079
they have a heart attack and that

1322
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:08,160
diabetes comes on

1323
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,680
until they have

1324
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
that

1325
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,119
stroke

1326
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,119
from big hunk of fat getting dislodged

1327
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,079
and floating up to the brain the point

1328
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,280
is if you don't have the pathogens you

1329
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,640
can eat all you want bring it on bring

1330
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,440
it in

1331
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,400
and you can do it until you die

1332
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,760
of a heart disease issue or something

1333
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,760
else

1334
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,319
if you don't have the pathogens

1335
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,440
when you have the pathogens the game

1336
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,400
changes

1337
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,240
it completely changes you guys

1338
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,319
that's when you get the hypothyroid

1339
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,000
that's when you get the hyperthyroid

1340
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,520
that's when you get the cancers that's

1341
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,720
when you get the als that's when you get

1342
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,160
the ms

1343
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,440
that's when you get the ra that's when

1344
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,599
you get the lupus that's when you get

1345
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,359
the neurological lyme that's why a 12

1346
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,280
year old can have neurological lyme

1347
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:02,400
that's why a 12 year old can have ra

1348
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,800
and fatigue think about that

1349
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:11,040
children's rheumatoid arthritis

1350
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:13,440
they didn't have 30 years of fast food

1351
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:17,119
but they have ra

1352
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,800
at 11 years old nine years old 14 years

1353
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,839
old they have debilitating ra

1354
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,680
and they don't have 50 years

1355
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,720
of junk food in them

1356
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,440
they have

1357
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,680
you know other things going on

1358
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
right

1359
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,280
and they have colitis

1360
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,760
right they can have debilitating colitis

1361
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,200
leukemia they can have other things

1362
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,200
they can be suffering with other

1363
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,400
disorders they can have

1364
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,240
eczema that's raging and debilitating

1365
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,559
psoriasis

1366
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,559
but they don't have 30 years of pulling

1367
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,400
up to that fast food restaurant and

1368
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,240
ordering all those bacon double cheese

1369
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,920
dogs and burgers

1370
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,280
in all those pizza fries or whatever the

1371
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,040
heck they're giving out there and all

1372
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,040
those buffalo chicken wings

1373
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,559
they don't have that in their system

1374
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,520
that's for the person who's not quite

1375
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,240
viral who's not quite pathogenic who

1376
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,079
maybe isn't pathogenic yet they don't

1377
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,400
have enough bugs in them yet and they

1378
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,400
can go and now they're 40 and now

1379
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,319
they're gaining weight yes and they're

1380
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,680
gaining weight and now they're heading

1381
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,200
to a place because of the processed

1382
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,319
foods and all the pizzas they're eating

1383
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,920
and everything else they're eating and

1384
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,720
the buffalo chicken wings and everything

1385
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,640
else

1386
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,079
now they're getting to the point where

1387
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,680
boom they can have their heart attack

1388
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,119
they can have their stroke they can have

1389
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,720
their fat clogging up their arteries in

1390
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,440
their heart and everything else and

1391
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,520
guess what if they get a pathogen

1392
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,319
they'll have that too

1393
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,160
you'll have lupus and heart disease

1394
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,680
you'll have multiple sclerosis and heart

1395
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,359
disease this is important to know right

1396
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,599
here you'll have neurological alignment

1397
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,760
heart disease you'll have ra and heart

1398
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,800
disease you'll have autoimmune and heart

1399
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,640
disease right if you have pathogens and

1400
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,400
your tank and the fast processed foods

1401
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,160
in the greasy foods you can have your

1402
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,839
diabetes heart problems and your

1403
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,640
neurological symptoms from all the

1404
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,920
pathogens do you see the details matter

1405
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,839
and that's why

1406
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,280
medicine is so off right now they can't

1407
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,200
even differ in differentia they can't

1408
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,880
even figure it out and be able to divide

1409
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,880
any of that they don't know any of the

1410
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,559
difference they're just like okay well

1411
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,839
you have autoimmune it's genetic okay

1412
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,440
what else do you have oh you have heart

1413
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,280
disease okay maybe you should back down

1414
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
on the processed foods that's pretty

1415
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,880
much it

1416
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,960
but they don't they don't know that whoa

1417
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,280
you got hhv-6 you got shingles you got

1418
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,839
epsine bar you've got sediment virus

1419
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,520
you've got simplex one the fever blister

1420
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,960
and it's causing all your jaw pain and

1421
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,200
your neck pain and your head pain and

1422
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,400
your eye your eye problems and your eye

1423
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,599
pain

1424
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,680
and they don't know that these things

1425
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,160
are causing reproductive problems too

1426
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,680
you can have endometriosis and still get

1427
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,880
heart disease down the road you could

1428
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,040
have pcos from viruses and still get

1429
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,079
your heart attack later on too you could

1430
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,079
have a combination

1431
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,520
and

1432
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,480
but all the

1433
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,720
all the

1434
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,640
people with big ideas in the health

1435
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,640
movement i think they figured it all out

1436
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,040
found the holy grail and they figured

1437
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,240
they they found it all out the big

1438
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,000
mystery they found atlantis

1439
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,079
they think it was just

1440
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,640
you're just eating all the wrong foods

1441
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,160
and once you clean up your diet

1442
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,240
you're gonna be all good that's not true

1443
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,400
sometimes you gotta dig deep and you

1444
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,240
gotta go for the gold because if you got

1445
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,000
enough pathogens and you you could be

1446
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,079
very young and you can clean up your

1447
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,040
diet and it's not enough you can clean

1448
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,119
up your diet as far as you want to go

1449
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,559
as far as the parameters they give you

1450
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,640
out there and it's not enough and then

1451
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,359
you have to learn what you're really

1452
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,040
doing and looking out for within that

1453
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,040
diet to get better

1454
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,400
that's why i see it all the time the

1455
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,800
vegans in a plant-based people they go

1456
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,640
plant-based and vegan they stay sick or

1457
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
they get sick

1458
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,400
and then they run back to animal protein

1459
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,640
thinking they are missing nutrients you

1460
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,079
know i just saw it recently someone was

1461
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,440
showing me something and it was like

1462
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,680
they're saying check this out check out

1463
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,200
this influencer here they went vegan one

1464
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,720
time in plant based and now they're

1465
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,400
talking about how they were missing all

1466
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,920
their nutrients

1467
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,359
they went vegan and plant-based and they

1468
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,800
were missing all their nutrients right

1469
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,400
now so now they're back on animal

1470
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,200
protein to make sure they get all their

1471
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,599
nutrients they're eating cottage cheese

1472
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,240
and they're having lots of yogurt

1473
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,079
and bovine yogurt and cottage cheese and

1474
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,680
they're having like raw cheese and

1475
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,240
they're having eggs and they're having

1476
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,520
salmon and they're having other fish

1477
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,359
and now they're getting all the

1478
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,040
nutrients they knew all the nutrients

1479
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,799
they need because when they were vegan

1480
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,200
and plant-based this influencer was

1481
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,079
vegan and plant-based they weren't doing

1482
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,040
good

1483
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,200
it's like

1484
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,319
whoa well i'm gonna feel really bad for

1485
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,640
that person because they're gonna do it

1486
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,000
real bad now

1487
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,359
meanwhile

1488
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,640
there's all these people eating animal

1489
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,480
protein eating all the same thing and

1490
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,160
they're sick out there i love how that

1491
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,160
works it doesn't make any sense right

1492
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,640
billions of people are eating animal

1493
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,640
protein and a fraction of people are

1494
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,000
they're plant-based right fraction of

1495
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,280
people and think about how many people

1496
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,040
are sick hospitals are filled with

1497
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,119
people eating animal protein including

1498
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,319
clean animal protein diets protein dyes

1499
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,200
including healthier animal protein diets

1500
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,559
right

1501
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,839
meanwhile they'll have the same problems

1502
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,880
that you know they'll have the same

1503
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,280
problem

1504
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,839
as the plant-based people right that are

1505
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,000
sick too that happens plant-based vegan

1506
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,680
person can be just as sick as an animal

1507
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,839
protein person they can have both the

1508
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,760
same sickness as hashimoto's

1509
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,440
they can have thyroid problems they can

1510
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,280
get told by their doctors their hormones

1511
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,200
are off they can have all the same

1512
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,440
problems everybody's worried about they

1513
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,640
can have fatigue animal protein person

1514
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,079
can have lots of fatigue and a

1515
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,839
plant-based person can have lots of

1516
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,359
fatigue

1517
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,920
okay

1518
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,760
i'm waiting for the cookies to kind of

1519
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,920
get nice and toasty in here and they're

1520
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,200
just about done i guess another couple

1521
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,200
minutes we're almost there

1522
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,760
we get lost and we run back and forth

1523
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,520
you can still heal eating animal protein

1524
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,280
and you can still heal eat being

1525
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,000
plant-based okay

1526
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,200
you could still heal being plant-based

1527
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,960
right

1528
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,559
anybody who's plant-based or vegan i

1529
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,240
recommend staying plant-based but

1530
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,480
learning how to do it anybody who wants

1531
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,839
to be animal protein you know what you

1532
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,119
can heal too

1533
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,119
just got to learn how to do it

1534
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,480
another thing too you could be on a

1535
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,240
plant-based vegan diet and eat a lot of

1536
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,680
junk food

1537
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,599
definitely can eat a lot of junk food

1538
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,359
you could do a vegan cheese

1539
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,200
that vegan cheese is rough on the system

1540
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,720
if you're trying to heal it's really

1541
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,839
hard on the system if you're trying to

1542
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,720
heal

1543
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:48,079
it's just as bad as the regular cheese

1544
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,240
in so many ways so keep that in mind

1545
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,319
right

1546
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,760
michelle l says if you take the wrong

1547
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,760
b12

1548
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,160
it won't absorb

1549
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,440
and it's true the details matter

1550
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,440
everything matters you can be a

1551
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,280
plant-based vegan person and thinking

1552
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,599
you're missing b12 somehow and take the

1553
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,440
wrong b12 and not get better

1554
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,680
the right b12 matters

1555
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,520
you guys know i use the vimergy b12

1556
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,480
that's the one i use and and i'm not

1557
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,160
sponsored

1558
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,720
but the stuff is the best it's a

1559
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,000
vimergy.com if you want the best b12

1560
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,760
since michelle

1561
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,760
was talking about it

1562
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,599
so

1563
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,200
i think what happens is the minute you

1564
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,720
get sick

1565
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,119
somebody gets sick and they're a newbie

1566
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,799
and they're not seasoned

1567
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,960
all they need is to hear a doctor or

1568
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,400
somebody say hey get off your bad foods

1569
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,839
meaning get off the junk foods and the

1570
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,040
processed foods and then everybody

1571
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,960
thinks they're they got it all sewed up

1572
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,079
but that's not reality

1573
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,400
reality is it's so much deeper than that

1574
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,400
the reason why we're sick is so much

1575
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,079
deeper than that

1576
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,319
and the details matter to how we can

1577
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,160
heal and recover right

1578
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,400
someone's dealing with low iron they're

1579
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,599
having a low iron issue that's viral

1580
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,920
because

1581
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,599
epstein-barr eats iron i talked about

1582
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,319
this for years so that means there's a

1583
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,319
low low-grade viral infection low-grade

1584
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,160
viral infection you'll hear that now

1585
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,559
people say low-grade out there low grade

1586
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,640
viral out there low grade viral

1587
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,799
medical medium information for 35 years

1588
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,160
is low grade viral infection you can

1589
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,920
read medical medium book one and you'll

1590
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,920
see it all through there low grade viral

1591
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,799
infection but

1592
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,839
the low grade viral infection

1593
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,599
is the reason why people have low iron

1594
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,440
because of a low-grade viral infection

1595
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,680
so they have low iron

1596
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,319
the more toxic heavy metal in them and

1597
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,440
the low-grade viral infection the lower

1598
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:38,880
the iron goes because epstein-barr feeds

1599
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,200
off of iron

1600
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,799
that's how it works so unless you get

1601
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,160
rid of the epstein bar and work on

1602
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,760
getting rid of the epsilon bar and

1603
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,440
breaking it down and getting it out and

1604
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,880
cleaning it up that's the key is

1605
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,680
cleaning that ebv up and getting it out

1606
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,440
your iron can come back up and come back

1607
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,280
up i'm gonna get these cookies out you

1608

rumble

1639
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,040
facebook

1640
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,400
now what's incredible about these

1641
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,520
cookies i'm just going to tell you right

1642
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,160
now

1643
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,000
is there's no oil on these cookies

1644
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,799
that's where we get in trouble

1645
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,640
it's the oil and everything

1646
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,440
it's the fat in everything that's where

1647
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,480
you get in trouble so you're allowed to

1648
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,480
eat a cookie

1649
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,280
when the oil is not inch all drenched

1650
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,119
inside of it in and out of it because

1651
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,359
that's when we get in trouble it's all

1652
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,040
the fats so keep that in mind so these

1653
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:51,520
aren't insulin resistant creators

1654
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,119
these are diabetic busters you know

1655
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,200
these are the kind of this is the kind

1656
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,480
of food the kind of meal is a fat free

1657
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,480
meal which

1658
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,200
gets rid of diabetes in people that's

1659
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,760
how we get rid of diabetes in people

1660
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,000
that's how we get rid of type 2 diabetes

1661
