[9.12 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[11.00 - 18.08] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 19.44] medium hello this is Anthony William
[18.08 - 21.56] you're listening to the medical medium
[19.44 - 24.88] radio show where each week you hear the
[21.56 - 27.68] most advanced healing information that's
[24.88 - 29.72] decades ahead of what's out there now if
[27.68 - 31.24] we think science and research knows
[29.72 - 33.84] everything thing about chronic illness
[31.24 - 35.96] we're actually blinded by something and
[33.84 - 38.44] I don't know what that is exactly
[35.96 - 40.80] besides maybe trust in the medical
[38.44 - 43.04] system and maybe that happens when we've
[40.80 - 44.72] never been sick we're we're not
[43.04 - 47.08] struggling we're not suffering we
[44.72 - 48.64] haven't gone to 10 neurologists I mean
[47.08 - 50.16] I've talked to people over the years
[48.64 - 52.44] that have come to me over the years I
[50.16 - 54.52] decades ago that have gone to five or
[52.44 - 57.40] eight or nine or 10 different
[54.52 - 60.60] neurologists looking for answers about
[57.40 - 63.28] their different symptoms 250 million
[60.60 - 65.12] Americans alone in the US don't have
[63.28 - 66.68] answers for symptoms they're dealing
[65.12 - 69.12] with and if they have an answer it
[66.68 - 70.56] doesn't mean it goes away and that's
[69.12 - 72.08] what we're up against right now so when
[70.56 - 73.12] you think about it you guys the science
[72.08 - 75.28] of research know everything about
[73.12 - 78.52] chronic illness they don't why would we
[75.28 - 81.04] ever think so at this point and and you
[78.52 - 83.84] know everything is blamed on us from
[81.04 - 85.80] genes and also our bodies attacking
[83.84 - 87.68] themselves we're told it's faulty you
[85.80 - 91.32] know our bodies are faulty our bodies
[87.68 - 94.04] are problematic and this is a example of
[91.32 - 97.32] how the industry is because what science
[94.04 - 100.44] and research does is it protects itself
[97.32 - 102.68] before it protects people that's how it
[100.44 - 106.04] works now not in every single field but
[102.68 - 108.92] in chronic illness I'm not talking about
[106.04 - 111.36] making Parts you know making nuts and
[108.92 - 114.24] bolts nuts and bolts you know that are
[111.36 - 116.48] put together so we have braces for our
[114.24 - 119.44] legs and we have different kinds of
[116.48 - 121.20] pieces of medical basically medical
[119.44 - 122.68] equipment we need in all kinds of
[121.20 - 124.48] different areas that science is working
[122.68 - 126.60] hard to try to perfect so we can live a
[124.48 - 129.00] better quality of life while we're sick
[126.60 - 131.00] I'm talking about every day aches and
[129.00 - 133.80] pains the tingles and numbness the
[131.00 - 136.28] vertigo the dizziness the balance issues
[133.80 - 139.04] the headaches the migraines the anxiety
[136.28 - 141.80] the depression I mean everything neck
[139.04 - 143.92] pain back pain sciatica from everything
[141.80 - 147.40] from planter fasciitis to bladder
[143.92 - 150.48] infections constant chronic UTI uh sinus
[147.40 - 153.40] infections that never go away to fungus
[150.48 - 156.72] on the skin to eczema and psoriasis to
[153.40 - 159.36] dermatitis to lyan scosi and Vitiligo to
[156.72 - 161.92] all kinds of what's deemed autoimmune
[159.36 - 164.16] diseases like Lyme disease and
[161.92 - 166.64] rheumatoid arthritis and Hashim modus
[164.16 - 170.12] thyroiditis to all these things we are
[166.64 - 171.96] in a bad place and it hasn't gotten
[170.12 - 174.24] better and yeah the world has gotten rid
[171.96 - 175.40] of processed foods not the whole world a
[174.24 - 177.32] lot of people are getting rid of
[175.40 - 179.76] processed foods they're getting now
[177.32 - 182.68] cleaner high fat diets versus the
[179.76 - 184.72] dirtier high-fat diet so instead of
[182.68 - 186.92] people getting fried grease with their
[184.72 - 188.96] with their bread and you know their
[186.92 - 190.76] bread and butter they're off their bread
[188.96 - 192.80] a lot of people are off their bread and
[190.76 - 194.68] they're off the fried grease and instead
[192.80 - 196.68] they're eating you know like healthier
[194.68 - 198.80] grease so they're eating their oils and
[196.68 - 200.68] they're eating their nut Butters and all
[198.80 - 202.88] that and that's actually healthier stuff
[200.68 - 204.64] but the keto diets and the keto way of
[202.88 - 206.68] thinking whether you're paleo whether
[204.64 - 208.20] you're paleo keto whether you're high
[206.68 - 212.16] protein keto whether you're plant-based
[208.20 - 214.08] keto still isn't fixing everybody it
[212.16 - 216.68] helps people with mild symptoms who have
[214.08 - 218.20] been on all the different diets I mean
[216.68 - 220.04] actually have you know it's been helped
[218.20 - 222.40] it it's helped people with milder
[220.04 - 224.36] symptoms who've eaten all not so great
[222.40 - 226.32] and don't take care of themselves and
[224.36 - 229.32] they seem to be okay but anybody else
[226.32 - 231.96] chronically ill with real problems the
[229.32 - 233.84] higher fat diets hasn't been helping and
[231.96 - 237.00] I'm going to talk about why cuz Today's
[233.84 - 240.04] Show is about toxic heavy metals and how
[237.00 - 242.08] the relationship of the higher fat diets
[240.04 - 245.28] that we're on whether they're clean and
[242.08 - 247.24] healthier ones right now okay how this
[245.28 - 249.36] doesn't work with toxic heavy metals and
[247.24 - 251.00] how toxic heavy metals are responsible
[249.36 - 252.56] for all the brain fog the Alzheimer's
[251.00 - 254.60] the Parkinson's the anxiety the
[252.56 - 257.88] depression the memory issues the OCD and
[254.60 - 260.36] that's just some of the things and these
[257.88 - 262.88] toxic heavy metals they feed pathogen
[260.36 - 265.80] illnesses that are not autoimmune it's
[262.88 - 267.08] called fibromyalgia CFS Ms lime disease
[265.80 - 269.04] these aren't autoimmune these aren't the
[267.08 - 270.60] body attacking itself these are there's
[269.04 - 272.32] real problems behind there these are
[270.60 - 273.96] pathogens behind this has nothing to do
[272.32 - 276.40] with autoimmune these are actually
[273.96 - 279.52] viruses and bacteria reproductive system
[276.40 - 281.96] problems econ rri it's PCOS and so much
[279.52 - 283.64] more and in the celery juice book I hope
[281.96 - 287.04] you guys have that celery juice book by
[283.64 - 288.40] now because almost 200 symptoms and
[287.04 - 290.80] conditions in that book I talk about
[288.40 - 292.32] about what the causes are what causes it
[290.80 - 293.80] and what to do for it this is an
[292.32 - 295.20] important radio show it's we're going to
[293.80 - 296.72] talk a little bit about the history on
[295.20 - 299.64] heavy metals toxic heavy metals where
[296.72 - 301.44] they come from and where we're going and
[299.64 - 304.28] you have to know I love science and
[301.44 - 305.92] research I love it and here's the funny
[304.28 - 307.92] thing
[305.92 - 310.40] hardcore conventional science and
[307.92 - 312.36] research hates all the other science and
[310.40 - 314.76] research so all the different things
[312.36 - 316.80] everybody's citing around like science
[314.76 - 318.92] science is behind that science is behind
[316.80 - 320.60] that study science is behind what how
[318.92 - 322.08] the Body Works science is behind this
[320.60 - 323.32] about autoimmune or this and this and
[322.08 - 326.44] this and no one
[323.32 - 328.36] realizes that those sciences that are
[326.44 - 330.32] all being created right now for even in
[328.36 - 332.08] alternative medicine thrown every
[330.32 - 334.00] everywhere like in in different
[332.08 - 337.16] countries and in the United States and
[334.00 - 338.60] everything that hardcore science
[337.16 - 341.64] conventional science doesn't doesn't
[338.60 - 343.28] back up any of it on any level so
[341.64 - 344.80] everybody's throwing throwing around
[343.28 - 346.76] different Sciences around every single
[344.80 - 348.16] day but we use the word as if
[346.76 - 350.04] everything's concrete and everybody's
[348.16 - 352.28] happy and the Science World is all happy
[350.04 - 355.36] the Science World is at war with itself
[352.28 - 357.04] right now totally completely at war with
[355.36 - 359.16] itself they're literally they're
[357.04 - 360.80] literally battling each other there's
[359.16 - 362.68] all kinds of different Sciences now and
[360.80 - 365.04] alternative medicine and someone's
[362.68 - 366.60] trying to prove the MTHFR G mutation
[365.04 - 368.00] Theory which was a theory that's all it
[366.60 - 370.52] was there's no science approve it till
[368.00 - 372.64] this day there's not one single bit of
[370.52 - 375.92] science regular science in conventional
[372.64 - 377.92] world doesn't believe in the MTHFR gen
[375.92 - 379.52] mutation they think that that's fake
[377.92 - 381.60] science isn't that
[379.52 - 383.56] incredible and because it actually is
[381.60 - 385.64] skewed by the way but there's also
[383.56 - 388.48] hardcore conventional science that's
[385.64 - 391.48] skewed too because it all is there's a
[388.48 - 393.92] reason for that in chronic illness
[391.48 - 396.96] there's a reason for that agendas are
[393.92 - 400.64] behind every single study they're behind
[396.96 - 403.56] it all and guess what all the things
[400.64 - 406.24] that make us sick are all avoided
[403.56 - 408.20] everybody just you know has to stay sick
[406.24 - 411.12] because of the wars because of the food
[408.20 - 413.12] War because of the science War
[411.12 - 415.92] everybody's got to stay sick that's how
[413.12 - 417.96] it works the food war is like the the
[415.92 - 419.56] animal High animal protein people
[417.96 - 421.44] against the vegans against the plant
[419.56 - 423.48] based there's that war and everybody's
[421.44 - 425.80] throwing their F fake Sciences back and
[423.48 - 427.76] forth you know the Paleo stuff this is
[425.80 - 429.36] why paleo's better this is why vegan is
[427.76 - 430.76] better this is why vegetarian's better
[429.36 - 432.56] it's all being thrown everybody's
[430.76 - 434.72] throwing their Sciences back and forth
[432.56 - 436.36] while everybody else has to sit there
[434.72 - 438.96] and suffer and get sick with their toxic
[436.36 - 441.76] heavy metals why everybody has to sitck
[438.96 - 443.60] there sit there and get and stay sick
[441.76 - 446.40] and get sicker with their pathogens
[443.60 - 448.00] their Epstein bar their hhv sixs their
[446.40 - 450.04] um there different varieties of strepto
[448.00 - 452.32] octus their shingles virus is their
[450.04 - 454.64] herpes simplex ones and twos all the
[452.32 - 456.40] mutations all the different varieties
[454.64 - 459.36] everybody just has to sit around and get
[456.40 - 460.84] sicker and sicker and sicker while the
[459.36 - 462.20] animal protein people are against the
[460.84 - 463.56] vegans vegans are against the animal
[462.20 - 465.00] protein people they're all thrown away
[463.56 - 467.40] bogus they're all thrown at each other
[465.00 - 469.84] bogus bogus fake science and then at the
[467.40 - 471.92] same time hardcore conventional science
[469.84 - 473.60] where you know Harvard stands behind it
[471.92 - 474.92] or whatever they're they're throwing
[473.60 - 476.32] things they're they're they're doing
[474.92 - 477.88] everything and throwing things at people
[476.32 - 479.40] too at the at the what they think is the
[477.88 - 480.80] alternative fake Sciences but they're
[479.40 - 482.48] all backed by money and funding to try
[480.80 - 484.04] to prove a point whether it's true
[482.48 - 486.24] accurate not true whether a thumb is on
[484.04 - 488.20] the scale they're all in it together and
[486.24 - 489.80] all these wars are going on why
[488.20 - 491.68] everybody just keeps on building heavy
[489.80 - 493.44] metals in their liver and in their brain
[491.68 - 494.92] doesn't know how to get it out of them
[493.44 - 496.40] doesn't even know the first thing to get
[494.92 - 497.92] it out of them and they get all the
[496.40 - 499.40] different problems and neurological
[497.92 - 501.08] problems and all the different viral
[499.40 - 503.48] problems and all our all all the kids
[501.08 - 504.84] are getting sick now teenagers all the
[503.48 - 506.52] different young adults are getting sick
[504.84 - 507.96] sicker than ever before in history we
[506.52 - 509.60] never saw this 30 years ago and
[507.96 - 513.24] everybody's busy with their War they're
[509.60 - 516.84] funded Wars just think about that you
[513.24 - 518.44] guys they're busy with their funded Wars
[516.84 - 521.04] isn't that interesting don't you think
[518.44 - 523.12] about it isn't it incredible where do I
[521.04 - 525.04] sit in the middle of it I work for you
[523.12 - 527.28] guys I work for God and I work for you
[525.04 - 528.52] guys and look you may not believe in God
[527.28 - 530.00] you may believe in something else that
[528.52 - 532.08] it's a big light in the sky that it's
[530.00 - 534.32] the universe maybe you believe in Gods
[532.08 - 535.60] maybe you believe in something else
[534.32 - 538.00] maybe you don't think it's a big man
[535.60 - 540.20] sitting in a chair with a beard maybe
[538.00 - 542.04] you think it's just this Creator or this
[540.20 - 544.40] Creator power or whatever whatever you
[542.04 - 547.24] might believe I I'm just saying whatever
[544.40 - 550.20] it is you believe I work for that I work
[547.24 - 553.32] for that and I work for you and that's
[550.20 - 556.68] what I do and I hear the information
[553.32 - 559.64] from my source since I was 4 years old
[556.68 - 561.44] so that it isn't tampered with and isn't
[559.64 - 564.68] tampered with and the wars don't
[561.44 - 566.44] interfere with it exactly and we're
[564.68 - 568.60] going to talk about heavy metals and
[566.44 - 571.20] that's where we're going right now so
[568.60 - 574.16] where did all these heavy metals come
[571.20 - 576.52] from that are inside our body wreaking
[574.16 - 579.48] havoc how could heavy metals be in your
[576.52 - 582.08] body how can it be possible first things
[579.48 - 584.24] first medications all medications have
[582.08 - 586.84] Metals in them all medications have
[584.24 - 588.72] Metals in them they end up in the liver
[586.84 - 590.88] that's where they end up let's go to
[588.72 - 592.80] another one fluoride are we getting
[590.88 - 594.28] fluoride treatments did you have 10 of
[592.80 - 595.76] them did you have five of them did you
[594.28 - 597.60] have one of them did you have a whole
[595.76 - 600.12] bunch of them when you were younger
[597.60 - 602.16] fluoride how about that one
[600.12 - 603.72] what about our water cuz you got to
[602.16 - 605.04] remember fluoride I'll just first of all
[603.72 - 606.76] let's back into this a little bit so I
[605.04 - 608.16] can clarify medications have Metals in
[606.76 - 610.12] them yes they have copper in them they
[608.16 - 611.68] have aluminum in them they got all kinds
[610.12 - 614.52] of stuff mercury in them they just have
[611.68 - 618.20] medications have things in them bottom
[614.52 - 620.48] line fluoride that's aluminum someone
[618.20 - 623.32] said to me and a trying to debate me on
[620.48 - 626.88] this and said no no fluoride's not
[623.32 - 630.64] aluminum it's a byproduct I'm like oh my
[626.88 - 632.64] God can we be any more or whatever you
[630.64 - 634.24] want to call that I don't know what that
[632.64 - 635.60] is you know when I get done talking to
[634.24 - 636.92] somebody like that I say you know what
[635.60 - 639.24] they just don't know and then in back of
[636.92 - 640.84] my head I'm like how can they not know
[639.24 - 642.88] so what is it are they just fighting for
[640.84 - 646.48] something just to prove themselves right
[642.88 - 648.92] or something fluoride a byproduct is
[646.48 - 651.24] methyl aluminum no matter how you slice
[648.92 - 653.12] the cake look none of us are all
[651.24 - 654.96] supposed to have the answers I totally
[653.12 - 656.68] get that we're all working hard together
[654.96 - 659.12] on the planet and that's not it I'm
[656.68 - 661.76] talking about health professionals that
[659.12 - 664.24] deem themselves at the top of their game
[661.76 - 666.44] and they want to debate me purposely
[664.24 - 668.44] because I hear a voice and they don't
[666.44 - 670.84] like the fact that that's where it's
[668.44 - 672.60] coming from and that's what I'm talking
[670.84 - 673.92] about I'm not talking about all of us
[672.60 - 676.36] that you know are just trying to find
[673.92 - 677.52] our way and get through everything and
[676.36 - 679.44] we're we're not supposed to know where
[677.52 - 681.08] medals are or where they come from or
[679.44 - 683.72] what they are we're just not we're too
[681.08 - 686.16] busy trying to survive think about that
[683.72 - 687.64] everybody's too busy trying to survive
[686.16 - 689.84] and live their life and get through
[687.64 - 691.76] their day and work their job and try to
[689.84 - 694.16] and try to get through and and through
[691.76 - 696.04] what struggle and whatever emotional
[694.16 - 697.36] challenges we get that's what's going on
[696.04 - 699.36] I'm talking about professionals that are
[697.36 - 701.88] supposed to be on top of their game and
[699.36 - 703.64] think they are or say they are you know
[701.88 - 705.00] and and and look we're all learn you
[703.64 - 706.56] know I told this professional I said
[705.00 - 708.84] look if you don't know
[706.56 - 711.52] fluoride in the end is a toxic heavy
[708.84 - 713.20] metal to the body then then why don't
[711.52 - 715.44] you learn about it you no big deal and
[713.20 - 718.32] if you don't know about it fine but but
[715.44 - 721.08] no this person was head head hellbent
[718.32 - 723.56] really just to be like no it's it it's
[721.08 - 725.52] not toxic to anybody first of all it's a
[723.56 - 727.40] neurotoxin it's a
[725.52 - 730.44] neurotoxin and it's you know it's
[727.40 - 732.84] nobody's it's nobody's fault it's
[730.44 - 735.08] nobody's fault but the big
[732.84 - 736.40] Industries it's nobody's fault but the
[735.08 - 739.20] big big
[736.40 - 740.92] industry and so there's nobody to blame
[739.20 - 743.08] there's nobody to blame on that level I
[740.92 - 744.56] mean they're the industries to blame
[743.08 - 745.96] what about our water too it's a whole
[744.56 - 749.20] another thing I mean we there's Metals
[745.96 - 750.80] in our water absolutely I mean how many
[749.20 - 752.52] water guys have I talked to over the
[750.80 - 754.72] years that are like you know any kind of
[752.52 - 756.28] apartment I've ever been in or any kind
[754.72 - 758.84] of different living situation I always
[756.28 - 761.04] have a water guy come and just do a
[758.84 - 762.24] little test of my water it's like oh
[761.04 - 764.00] yeah you're you know what you're you're
[762.24 - 765.84] doing good something pars per million
[764.00 - 769.12] lead not actually perfectly agreeable
[765.84 - 770.76] EPA safe and then you got no just very
[769.12 - 772.88] little traces of arsenic totally in
[770.76 - 775.16] range of what we're allowed to have I'm
[772.88 - 778.24] like are you kidding
[775.16 - 780.80] me and he was like okay yeah that's her
[778.24 - 782.56] water stand standard that's like our
[780.80 - 785.12] water standard there's all that stuff is
[782.56 - 787.00] in our water I mean it really is it's
[785.12 - 789.72] like yeah but it's not above the what
[787.00 - 792.16] you know the APA caus dangerous TOS what
[789.72 - 793.96] do you mean like this stuff goes in the
[792.16 - 795.64] liver and builds up and how much water
[793.96 - 797.24] are you drinking and not drinking I'm
[795.64 - 801.24] sorry for giggling about this I'm just
[797.24 - 805.96] saying that it's almost like so obvious
[801.24 - 809.00] that it just it it hurts it just does um
[805.96 - 811.64] and then our air I mean you know there's
[809.00 - 813.48] Metals dropping out of the sky in
[811.64 - 816.36] abundance in
[813.48 - 817.88] abundance you know I mean I was talking
[816.36 - 819.32] to somebody in the spiritual movement
[817.88 - 821.80] and they're like yeah I believe in
[819.32 - 823.24] abundance this person was telling me and
[821.80 - 824.32] you I got a lot of respect for this
[823.24 - 826.84] person they're like I believe in
[824.32 - 828.76] abundance it's all about an abundance
[826.84 - 831.44] and I said and they
[828.76 - 833.72] said and they said to me and they said
[831.44 - 835.92] to me this person said to me Anthony
[833.72 - 838.04] like what's your whole Mantra like
[835.92 - 839.68] what's your whole thing and I'm like
[838.04 - 841.80] well I just just know that there's an
[839.68 - 844.16] abundance of toxic heavy metals raining
[841.80 - 848.08] out of the sky I know it's Doom and
[844.16 - 850.12] Gloom but if I don't stay aware of it
[848.08 - 852.04] and teach others so we can get it out of
[850.12 - 853.36] our body because it's going to be there
[852.04 - 855.28] I want to get it out of everybody's body
[853.36 - 856.80] so they can heal you know I can't and
[855.28 - 859.24] you know it was funny and the spiritual
[856.80 - 860.44] person spiritual Guru was like you know
[859.24 - 863.04] I never thought about that they were
[860.44 - 864.68] like I never thought about that they
[863.04 - 866.68] like I'm always worried I just always
[864.68 - 868.00] want abundance to come to me like and
[866.68 - 869.20] come to me that's what this person was
[868.00 - 871.40] saying
[869.20 - 873.20] and I was like I look that's amazing but
[871.40 - 875.96] I just want the abundance of metals out
[873.20 - 877.76] of people's bodies that's what I want
[875.96 - 879.28] and that's what I live for you know it's
[877.76 - 881.44] like it's you know because that's how
[879.28 - 883.12] much we're up against aluminum cans have
[881.44 - 886.24] you have you consumed anything out of an
[883.12 - 888.84] aluminum can or aluminum foil have you
[886.24 - 890.68] eaten anything out of aluminum foil I
[888.84 - 891.96] mean right I I knew somebody that worked
[890.68 - 894.92] at a restaurant and said the aluminum
[891.96 - 897.28] foil they use was low grade and I was
[894.92 - 899.52] like low grade that's right low grade
[897.28 - 901.00] aluminum foil and they said yeah and
[899.52 - 902.80] they said every time they would bake
[901.00 - 904.52] like a macaroni and cheese in the oven
[902.80 - 906.04] at this restaurant they would put the
[904.52 - 907.64] foil over the top and they'd bake the
[906.04 - 910.16] macaroni and cheese and stuff like that
[907.64 - 912.44] and then they remove the foil and pieces
[910.16 - 916.96] of foil were just they melt it off of
[912.44 - 920.12] the foil into the macaroni and cheese
[916.96 - 922.08] and so the bottom line is the bottom
[920.12 - 924.44] line is so listen I'm telling you all
[922.08 - 925.96] these things because we get exposed and
[924.44 - 927.92] how many sticks of gum has everybody
[925.96 - 930.36] been eating all these years you know the
[927.92 - 933.64] foil and n it's really incredible what
[930.36 - 936.68] about pots and pans you know it's like
[933.64 - 938.16] even the stainless steel pots and pans
[936.68 - 940.76] stainless steel pots and pans that we
[938.16 - 944.16] deal with in the restaurants I've seen
[940.76 - 945.60] pots scraped to the Bone a friend of
[944.16 - 948.40] mine years ago at a restaurant people
[945.60 - 950.36] were just scraping the pots with metal
[948.40 - 952.48] utensils where do you think all those
[950.36 - 955.16] metal shavings went they went in
[952.48 - 958.28] somebody's meal and they went in lots of
[955.16 - 961.84] meals I mean restaurants are like one of
[958.28 - 964.48] the most toxic heavy metal providing
[961.84 - 967.16] Industries for everybody and we fill a
[964.48 - 969.96] lifetime of up in using you know those
[967.16 - 972.08] those just feel a lifetime of eating out
[969.96 - 974.56] in restaurants I'm not trying to keep
[972.08 - 976.00] you living in a box I'm not trying to
[974.56 - 978.88] get you guys to just live in a little
[976.00 - 980.48] box and never experience the world
[978.88 - 982.48] that's not what I'm trying to do I just
[980.48 - 983.96] want to get the medals out of you faster
[982.48 - 985.32] than we're putting them in how about
[983.96 - 987.96] that I'm just going to repeat that I
[985.32 - 990.24] know it's annoying I'm probably annoying
[987.96 - 992.84] today but the bottom line is I want to
[990.24 - 996.04] get the metals out of you faster than
[992.84 - 997.92] we're putting them in that's the bottom
[996.04 - 999.60] line and then let's keep on going a
[997.92 - 1002.28] little bit long I'm not even talking
[999.60 - 1003.76] about old metal fillings I'm not even
[1002.28 - 1008.44] talking about those those silver
[1003.76 - 1011.12] fillings of the old days I mean how many
[1008.44 - 1014.72] how many times did the industry try to
[1011.12 - 1016.48] protect those metal fillings how many
[1014.72 - 1017.84] times have they protected those metal
[1016.48 - 1020.16] fillings to the point where everybody's
[1017.84 - 1022.64] getting ceramic right now but they stood
[1020.16 - 1025.64] by it the industry stood by it because
[1022.64 - 1028.24] Mercury was mandatory in the
[1025.64 - 1030.24] conventional standard to get into people
[1028.24 - 1031.96] how do you like that it's just
[1030.24 - 1034.32] unbelievable we thought we were ahead of
[1031.96 - 1035.80] the game long time ago with that one and
[1034.32 - 1039.84] that's what I mean science of research
[1035.80 - 1042.84] proves itself as a bomb every time every
[1039.84 - 1046.08] decade it's always wrong but we heralded
[1042.84 - 1049.72] is this unbelievable thing that's always
[1046.08 - 1052.56] right I mean come on are you sick of it
[1049.72 - 1054.36] yet and then what about and listen think
[1052.56 - 1055.76] about the metal fillings and the Mercury
[1054.36 - 1057.12] fillings what we had to deal with and
[1055.76 - 1059.56] what people are still dealing with
[1057.12 - 1060.76] that's not a problem that went away I
[1059.56 - 1063.48] know people with plenty of metal
[1060.76 - 1066.04] fillings in their mouth I mean it's not
[1063.48 - 1067.80] like it's gone everybody's dealing with
[1066.04 - 1069.20] it a lot of them have these little these
[1067.80 - 1072.88] little metal fillings and big metal
[1069.20 - 1076.16] fillings in today just plenty of them
[1072.88 - 1077.96] copper pipes yeah copper pipes oh maybe
[1076.16 - 1080.32] your house doesn't have copper pipes old
[1077.96 - 1082.32] copper pipes pipes but maybe a friend's
[1080.32 - 1085.92] house did and you stayed over and had a
[1082.32 - 1087.76] couple tea 5 years ago yeah cup of tea
[1085.92 - 1089.20] you know it's unbelievable how easy it
[1087.76 - 1090.40] is to get all these Metals in us and
[1089.20 - 1092.96] that's just one
[1090.40 - 1094.28] thing pesticides herbicides fungicides
[1092.96 - 1096.56] have you eaten organic since you were
[1094.28 - 1100.36] born because pesticides herbicides
[1096.56 - 1102.12] fungicides are ladened in Copper ladened
[1100.36 - 1105.24] in Copper toxic
[1102.12 - 1107.64] copper it it look I can fill the whole
[1105.24 - 1108.84] show with all this fun stuff this part
[1107.64 - 1110.40] right here
[1108.84 - 1113.20] I really can't but let me go a little
[1110.40 - 1115.60] further back let me go a little further
[1113.20 - 1118.88] back than this let's go into Quicks
[1115.60 - 1121.92] silver Quicksilver is a tonic from the
[1118.88 - 1124.52] 17 and 1800s that everybody drank when
[1121.92 - 1126.76] they went to the doctor that's it you
[1124.52 - 1128.84] wouldn't go to the doctor and leave
[1126.76 - 1132.76] without Quicksilver Quicksilver was
[1128.84 - 1136.84] Mercury heated up in a tube with a with
[1132.76 - 1139.08] a a flame a candle underneath it in
[1136.84 - 1142.44] water till the Mercury would kind of
[1139.08 - 1145.32] separate itself just enough and out gas
[1142.44 - 1148.12] into that into that fluid into that
[1145.32 - 1151.64] liquid and then they pour it into a
[1148.12 - 1153.16] little cup and you drink it that's what
[1151.64 - 1154.36] that's what everybody did didn't matter
[1153.16 - 1156.16] what was wrong with you you come in
[1154.36 - 1158.52] there the element the the conventional
[1156.16 - 1162.04] standard the conventional standard was
[1158.52 - 1164.28] Quicksilver bottom line a Mercury drink
[1162.04 - 1165.96] and all your forefathers drank it I
[1164.28 - 1168.64] don't care what anybody says I'm going
[1165.96 - 1170.24] to tell you right now I I don't care
[1168.64 - 1172.04] what anybody says cuz somebody said to
[1170.24 - 1173.56] me there's no way my my grandparents
[1172.04 - 1175.08] drank that or my great-grandparents or
[1173.56 - 1177.00] their grand great grandparents drank
[1175.08 - 1180.12] that not in my life there's no way not
[1177.00 - 1181.84] in my family line you're wrong I if they
[1180.12 - 1183.72] went then they never went to a doctor
[1181.84 - 1185.64] once in their life during the 1800s
[1183.72 - 1189.32] that's what it means and I would say
[1185.64 - 1191.92] that okay so that means that their whole
[1189.32 - 1194.48] lifetime they never went to the doctor
[1191.92 - 1199.08] once not even in their childhood not
[1194.48 - 1200.32] even once for a fever back in the 1800s
[1199.08 - 1202.56] because that's the only way they can
[1200.32 - 1204.68] avoid Quicks over so if you can
[1202.56 - 1206.20] guarantee that for me then I will
[1204.68 - 1209.28] believe you if you can't guarantee that
[1206.20 - 1211.36] I'll never believe you never because
[1209.28 - 1213.92] everybody went to the doctor at least
[1211.36 - 1216.72] once and drank that tonic children
[1213.92 - 1218.28] included that's what was done that was
[1216.72 - 1219.64] the that was the standard of science and
[1218.28 - 1221.92] research you know what
[1219.64 - 1223.44] happened no one would see the doctors
[1221.92 - 1226.20] that the medical establishment was
[1223.44 - 1229.56] running out of money and
[1226.20 - 1232.36] collapsing collapsing down F the House
[1229.56 - 1233.96] of Cards was falling by the late by the
[1232.36 - 1237.24] mid
[1233.96 - 1240.08] 1800s no one went to the doctor anymore
[1237.24 - 1242.60] and I'll tell you why because the word
[1240.08 - 1245.24] quack was for the conventional doctor
[1242.60 - 1246.88] not for the herbalist down the road not
[1245.24 - 1249.56] for the chiropractor down the road that
[1246.88 - 1252.16] believes in some kind of energy medicine
[1249.56 - 1254.84] not for the naturopathic doctor that
[1252.16 - 1257.84] have they have more respect now not for
[1254.84 - 1260.84] anybody else not for any kind of person
[1257.84 - 1264.44] not for any kind of healer quack wasn't
[1260.84 - 1267.08] the word for any of them quack was the
[1264.44 - 1268.48] word for the conventional doctor because
[1267.08 - 1271.32] by the mid
[1268.48 - 1273.28] 1850s everybody thought that if you went
[1271.32 - 1277.28] to them and drank that tonic you would
[1273.28 - 1280.24] come home with Madness
[1277.28 - 1283.28] Insanity so they called them the Quack
[1280.24 - 1285.88] Like quack like a duck you'd come home
[1283.28 - 1288.72] in Hyster like an hysterical manner from
[1285.88 - 1290.12] the Mercury sometimes there logically
[1288.72 - 1292.16] riddled in
[1290.12 - 1294.52] Madness and that's how you would come
[1292.16 - 1297.04] home and that's why they they deemed the
[1294.52 - 1298.16] conventional doctor of the quack but
[1297.04 - 1301.52] what happened
[1298.16 - 1303.64] was it boomed a business that never was
[1301.52 - 1305.84] thought of as anything it boomed the
[1303.64 - 1309.48] Alternative Market for the first time
[1305.84 - 1312.52] that's why holistic medicine started it
[1309.48 - 1317.04] exploded Homeopathy
[1312.52 - 1318.56] Chiropractic all of it it exploded
[1317.04 - 1320.52] naturopathy
[1318.56 - 1323.52] herbalism it
[1320.52 - 1325.92] exploded it came to life because it was
[1323.52 - 1326.84] where everybody went to by the turn of
[1325.92 - 1330.20] the
[1326.84 - 1332.92] century to stay away from the quacks
[1330.20 - 1334.20] isn't it interesting right interesting
[1332.92 - 1337.40] and then the quacks needed to take
[1334.20 - 1339.96] control so they advertised they no
[1337.40 - 1342.92] longer used Quicksilver there was a
[1339.96 - 1346.60] massive funding and medical back and
[1342.92 - 1349.40] funded campaign to save the conventional
[1346.60 - 1351.88] model and it was a huge advertising
[1349.40 - 1354.08] campaign by the late 1800s we no longer
[1351.88 - 1356.36] use Quicksilver please come to us we no
[1354.08 - 1359.04] longer use Quicksilver please come to
[1356.36 - 1361.04] us that's what would happen the only
[1359.04 - 1363.12] people the quacks would be servicing at
[1361.04 - 1365.44] that point were the people at the
[1363.12 - 1367.88] sanitariums people that were already
[1365.44 - 1369.68] having problems with Madness even sane
[1367.88 - 1371.80] people that were just stuck in the
[1369.68 - 1373.16] sanitariums and that's the only people
[1371.80 - 1375.56] that a conventional doctor ever worked
[1373.16 - 1377.64] on anymore because no one would go to
[1375.56 - 1378.92] the doctor they would go to herbalist
[1377.64 - 1381.76] and every everybody
[1378.92 - 1383.36] else so just a little history but here's
[1381.76 - 1386.40] the problem we all have mercury in us
[1383.36 - 1389.28] because of it we all have mercury passed
[1386.40 - 1393.64] down to Generation generation through
[1389.28 - 1395.36] utero all of it that's how we have it
[1393.64 - 1397.72] and we still do and it's been building
[1395.36 - 1400.48] up and we have mercury in other places
[1397.72 - 1402.44] too so there's a little bit of History
[1400.48 - 1404.52] just so you know it's important metals
[1402.44 - 1406.20] are microscopic they can't be seen
[1404.52 - 1409.00] they're they're smaller than
[1406.20 - 1411.24] nanoscopic they can't be seen
[1409.00 - 1412.80] and what you don't see won't hurt that's
[1411.24 - 1415.80] what the industry always thinks we don't
[1412.80 - 1418.60] see it you're fine Mr Mrs Jones you're
[1415.80 - 1421.08] you guys are fine we don't see it so it
[1418.60 - 1422.96] can't be a problem toxic heavy metals
[1421.08 - 1424.88] are a particular type of toxin that
[1422.96 - 1426.32] celery juices sodium cluster salts take
[1424.88 - 1428.44] on so we're talking about celery juice
[1426.32 - 1429.60] too celery juice helps with toxic heavy
[1428.44 - 1430.72] metals we're going to go into that a
[1429.60 - 1433.96] little
[1430.72 - 1436.88] bit heavy metals have a destructive
[1433.96 - 1438.76] active charge to them that causes the
[1436.88 - 1440.32] metals to be Dam damaging to the liver
[1438.76 - 1443.72] cells brain cells and other cells
[1440.32 - 1446.76] throughout the body cluster salts sodium
[1443.72 - 1449.28] cluster salts diffuse this charge
[1446.76 - 1451.16] rendering them inactive and less
[1449.28 - 1452.24] aggressive think about how powerful that
[1451.16 - 1453.76] is when you're drinking your celery
[1452.24 - 1455.80] juice all the sodium cluster salts are
[1453.76 - 1457.00] in C juice that science of research
[1455.80 - 1459.08] doesn't know about
[1457.00 - 1460.20] yet that doesn't know about yet you
[1459.08 - 1461.44] think science of research knows
[1460.20 - 1463.64] everything you think they know
[1461.44 - 1465.56] everything they don't it's so important
[1463.64 - 1468.88] to know that and understand
[1465.56 - 1471.24] that because you're going to need you're
[1468.88 - 1473.36] going to need different information
[1471.24 - 1475.40] because this world's not easy to go in
[1473.36 - 1478.20] and people already are suffering to a
[1475.40 - 1481.36] degree that's unbelievable from young to
[1478.20 - 1483.40] old so you need Advanced
[1481.36 - 1485.68] information and these sodium cluster
[1483.40 - 1487.84] salts they diffuse the charge rendering
[1485.68 - 1490.88] them inactive and less
[1487.84 - 1493.68] aggressive they disarm toxic heavy
[1490.88 - 1495.92] metals such as copper Mercury and
[1493.68 - 1496.76] aluminum and there's other metals too
[1495.92 - 1499.84] there's
[1496.76 - 1501.84] nickel there's arsenic there's a lot of
[1499.84 - 1504.36] different Metals there
[1501.84 - 1508.24] cadmium and you know barium there's
[1504.36 - 1510.56] different Metals celery juices
[1508.24 - 1512.56] antioxidants is another thing that we
[1510.56 - 1514.00] need really desperately one of the
[1512.56 - 1517.04] functions of the celery juices
[1514.00 - 1521.16] antioxidants not just not other
[1517.04 - 1523.32] antioxidants is to remove fatty deposits
[1521.16 - 1524.72] from the heavy metal CU this is what I
[1523.32 - 1526.24] was talking about earlier we on these
[1524.72 - 1529.92] high fat
[1526.24 - 1531.92] diets we on high fat diets all the time
[1529.92 - 1534.04] and high fat diets means we saturate our
[1531.92 - 1538.28] bodies with with with fats that's how it
[1534.04 - 1540.36] works metals that sit and oxidize inside
[1538.28 - 1543.32] our body oxidize faster when our
[1540.36 - 1545.28] bloodstream is filled with fat so we're
[1543.32 - 1548.24] all told to be on these high fat diets
[1545.28 - 1549.96] right now that's what we're told all the
[1548.24 - 1552.12] vegans and plant-based people they're
[1549.96 - 1555.12] just going all to high fat that's what
[1552.12 - 1557.68] they do all of the you know the the high
[1555.12 - 1560.12] protein people paleo people animal
[1557.68 - 1561.64] protein people they all go to high fat
[1560.12 - 1563.16] and this is what everybody's doing and
[1561.64 - 1564.72] they're all mixing it all up they're all
[1563.16 - 1566.32] mixing it all up the nut Butters and
[1564.72 - 1569.52] everything else they all that nut
[1566.32 - 1571.72] Butters are healthy but you know in just
[1569.52 - 1574.56] in small quantities periodically because
[1571.72 - 1576.56] we need more other things that are more
[1574.56 - 1578.68] critical so we're all heading to the
[1576.56 - 1580.64] keto land because it keeps you off of
[1578.68 - 1582.20] processed foods it gets you exercising a
[1580.64 - 1584.56] little bit gets a few pounds off the
[1582.20 - 1585.88] belly for a lot of people not everybody
[1584.56 - 1587.24] but for a lot of people when they first
[1585.88 - 1588.44] go on it after getting off the standard
[1587.24 - 1590.68] American
[1588.44 - 1592.16] diet and so they're into the keto thing
[1590.68 - 1593.84] and they think they found a Holy Grail
[1592.16 - 1595.48] the the health professionals today think
[1593.84 - 1598.36] the keto thing is a Holy Grail but what
[1595.48 - 1602.80] it is it's just no
[1598.36 - 1604.88] grains it's no sugar which is bad sugar
[1602.80 - 1607.76] cuz no one ever ate fruit
[1604.88 - 1610.00] anyway so it's just bad sugar staying
[1607.76 - 1611.44] off of bad sugar staying off of
[1610.00 - 1613.92] processed food staying off of Grease
[1611.44 - 1616.68] staying off of um of high processed
[1613.92 - 1618.40] greased fatty fast food and go for the
[1616.68 - 1620.16] healthier fats
[1618.40 - 1621.60] so that's what it means and everybody
[1620.16 - 1623.16] does get a little bit better that's why
[1621.60 - 1624.40] I don't even I don't even mind the keto
[1623.16 - 1625.84] diet to some degree because if it'll
[1624.40 - 1627.80] keep somebody off the standard American
[1625.84 - 1629.68] diet and keep them from eating fried
[1627.80 - 1630.88] fast food they're going to do better but
[1629.68 - 1632.08] when we're chronically ill and we're
[1630.88 - 1634.24] suffering and struggling we have
[1632.08 - 1636.68] symptoms that won't go away that hasn't
[1634.24 - 1639.68] fixed anybody that's not getting those
[1636.68 - 1641.40] real real serious pathogen and toxic
[1639.68 - 1642.88] heavy metal symptoms to go away in fact
[1641.40 - 1645.00] it does the opposite when we have the
[1642.88 - 1647.60] toxic heavy metals the more fat we put
[1645.00 - 1649.52] into our body the more they oxidize the
[1647.60 - 1651.92] fats cling to the metals and cause them
[1649.52 - 1655.84] to rush and Decay and
[1651.92 - 1659.44] oxidize and that's what they do and we
[1655.84 - 1662.08] faster deteriorate later we age faster
[1659.44 - 1663.08] in the brain we deteriorate later and
[1662.08 - 1665.24] that's what
[1663.08 - 1668.08] happens and those antioxidants and
[1665.24 - 1670.32] celery juice help to separate the fat
[1668.08 - 1673.76] deposits from the
[1670.32 - 1675.52] metal they act like suction cups see
[1673.76 - 1677.48] here's how it works fatty deposits cling
[1675.52 - 1680.08] to toxic heavy metal deposits like SU
[1677.48 - 1682.52] ction cups and when fatty deposits and
[1680.08 - 1685.32] toxic heavy metals touch like this it
[1682.52 - 1689.44] causes the metals to
[1685.32 - 1691.56] oxidize byproduct of the metal develops
[1689.44 - 1694.92] discharge that's what
[1691.56 - 1698.28] happens a production
[1694.92 - 1700.80] occurs toxic heavy metals possess a
[1698.28 - 1702.72] destructive charge which is part of what
[1700.80 - 1704.84] causes them to reative fatty deposits to
[1702.72 - 1706.88] begin with and and other toxic heavy
[1704.84 - 1709.56] metals aggressively so that means if you
[1706.88 - 1712.00] have other tox heavy metals they mix
[1709.56 - 1716.24] with other metals they
[1712.00 - 1719.20] oxidize they they they discharge toxic
[1716.24 - 1722.68] charges essentially we're talking about
[1719.20 - 1726.84] heavy metals rusting in the body leading
[1722.68 - 1727.96] to corrosive runoff that is damaging to
[1726.84 - 1731.36] nearby
[1727.96 - 1733.60] tissue think about that that's what
[1731.36 - 1736.72] happens that that's what
[1733.60 - 1738.92] happens so sure if we're on a really
[1736.72 - 1741.52] really toxic high fat diet which is a
[1738.92 - 1745.08] standard American diet we get we get the
[1741.52 - 1748.40] Alzheimer's quicker we get um dementia
[1745.08 - 1750.56] quicker we get memory problems quicker
[1748.40 - 1751.80] we get all kinds of different issues
[1750.56 - 1753.44] quicker in the brain we get
[1751.80 - 1755.72] crystallizations in the brain we get
[1753.44 - 1757.28] calcifications in the brain we get all
[1755.72 - 1759.28] kinds of different spots in the brain we
[1757.28 - 1762.04] age our brain
[1759.28 - 1763.52] shrinks so taking people off the
[1762.04 - 1765.44] standard American diet and putting them
[1763.52 - 1767.44] on a healthy high-fat diet improves them
[1765.44 - 1769.84] and slows all that down but by no means
[1767.44 - 1773.44] means does it stop the process of the
[1769.84 - 1775.36] metals causing dementia Alzheimer's
[1773.44 - 1777.00] memory problems crystallizations
[1775.36 - 1780.56] calcifications in the
[1777.00 - 1782.64] brain it doesn't stop any of this or
[1780.56 - 1784.88] liver issues or other toxic issues in
[1782.64 - 1787.08] the body like feeding viruses and making
[1784.88 - 1788.72] viruses get worse why do you think you
[1787.08 - 1790.76] got people on all kinds of diets you got
[1788.72 - 1793.00] people on clean paleo diets they're sick
[1790.76 - 1794.76] they're sick with chronic fatigue I
[1793.00 - 1796.04] thought that I thought the the Paleo
[1794.76 - 1798.08] would fix them right wouldn't you think
[1796.04 - 1800.20] so no people on plant-based diet sick
[1798.08 - 1802.60] with chronic fatigue plant-based diet
[1800.20 - 1804.60] didn't fix them people on all these
[1802.60 - 1807.00] different diets chronically sick with
[1804.60 - 1808.68] all kinds of problems different diets
[1807.00 - 1810.24] everywhere whether they're on the you
[1808.68 - 1812.68] know one side of it or the other side of
[1810.24 - 1816.20] it animal non-animal whatever it
[1812.68 - 1817.44] is and they still suffer everybody's
[1816.20 - 1818.88] still dealing with their problems and
[1817.44 - 1820.32] symptoms going to different doctors then
[1818.88 - 1822.20] the doctors blame the diet like the
[1820.32 - 1823.64] vegan diet or they'll blame this and
[1822.20 - 1824.92] that and it's back and forth you go to
[1823.64 - 1826.16] another doctor it's great when you're
[1824.92 - 1829.16] young and you're not really sick and
[1826.16 - 1831.84] you're exercising every day and you just
[1829.16 - 1834.56] got like little problems like really
[1831.84 - 1837.48] little ones but you take a mom who can't
[1834.56 - 1839.80] get out of bed with all she's got just
[1837.48 - 1842.48] to drive her kids to school because of
[1839.80 - 1845.12] crippling anxiety or severe fatigue with
[1842.48 - 1846.92] no answers abound and she's trying the
[1845.12 - 1848.56] best keto diet possible and she's trying
[1846.92 - 1850.28] the best plant-based diet possible she's
[1848.56 - 1851.92] trying the best animal diet possible and
[1850.28 - 1853.24] she's gone to 10 doctors already and two
[1851.92 - 1856.16] functional medicine doctors and two
[1853.24 - 1857.96] neurologists and two internists and
[1856.16 - 1860.60] still can't get to where she needs to be
[1857.96 - 1862.20] the keto diet's not going to fix it the
[1860.60 - 1865.40] plantbase diet's not going to fix it you
[1862.20 - 1868.20] need more than that you need information
[1865.40 - 1870.60] because you can do plant-based high fat
[1868.20 - 1873.32] and still keep yourself sick you can do
[1870.60 - 1874.92] keto Paleo High fat animal protein high
[1873.32 - 1876.92] fat and keep yourself sick even if
[1874.92 - 1878.92] you're staying away from bad sugar and
[1876.92 - 1882.20] processed
[1878.92 - 1884.56] foods because the metals oxidize and
[1882.20 - 1887.56] feed pathogens that's where we're going
[1884.56 - 1889.40] next fatty deposits all throughout the
[1887.56 - 1893.16] body
[1889.40 - 1895.32] discharge because they're attached to
[1893.16 - 1898.20] heavy metals that are oxidizing and
[1895.32 - 1903.00] rusting so all of this just throws out a
[1898.20 - 1906.36] throws out a problem it throws out a
[1903.00 - 1908.20] problem as a result the fatty deposit
[1906.36 - 1911.00] becomes highly
[1908.20 - 1914.12] toxic and it can act as fuel for guess
[1911.00 - 1916.48] what so those fatty deposits they're cor
[1914.12 - 1918.52] that hold all that corrosive rust and
[1916.48 - 1922.12] material and it's holding on to it
[1918.52 - 1924.28] becomes this powerful food in a bad way
[1922.12 - 1927.40] to viruses like gapin bar viruses like
[1924.28 - 1931.44] the shingles human herpes viral 6 that's
[1927.40 - 1934.44] hhv6 hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 11 12 13
[1931.44 - 1937.08] 14 15 16 yeah that's how many viruses
[1934.44 - 1940.72] are out there and their undiscovered
[1937.08 - 1942.96] cousins and any other kind of pathogen
[1940.72 - 1945.68] that may even reach the brain causing a
[1942.96 - 1948.16] myriad of problems and conditions
[1945.68 - 1949.08] undiagnosed and so
[1948.16 - 1951.24] these
[1949.08 - 1953.16] viruses they like to feed off of this
[1951.24 - 1955.48] discharge that heavy metals create and
[1953.16 - 1958.08] remember all this is happening while
[1955.48 - 1960.40] everybody's asleep everybody's the food
[1958.08 - 1962.60] Wars are going on everybody's throwing
[1960.40 - 1964.96] their fake science back and forth
[1962.60 - 1966.32] constantly this study here let's site
[1964.96 - 1967.92] this but there's really no information
[1966.32 - 1969.40] really in it in the end let's site this
[1967.92 - 1972.08] let's site that let's keep on throwing
[1969.40 - 1974.04] these theories around that are funded
[1972.08 - 1976.20] and thumbed basically a thumb on the
[1974.04 - 1978.12] scale all interest groups behind it
[1976.20 - 1980.44] let's keep on let's keep keep the war
[1978.12 - 1982.12] going you know let's the vegans keep on
[1980.44 - 1983.84] fighting the paleos but no everybody's
[1982.12 - 1985.84] sick though everybody's still
[1983.84 - 1987.24] sick and so because there's more
[1985.84 - 1989.24] information to be had there's more
[1987.24 - 1991.40] information to be learned let's keep the
[1989.24 - 1994.08] food Wars going let's keep the science
[1991.40 - 1996.44] Wars going hardcore conventional science
[1994.08 - 1999.04] in the in Harvard and and and yeah hard
[1996.44 - 2000.68] you know hardcore science all all upset
[1999.04 - 2002.20] at the alternative Sciences so
[2000.68 - 2003.96] alternative science is all upet about
[2002.20 - 2005.40] them they're all thrown or all kinds of
[2003.96 - 2008.08] stuff around why everybody's sick
[2005.40 - 2011.12] because everybody's too busy fting each
[2008.08 - 2015.16] other and then your Metals they're
[2011.12 - 2017.72] oxidizing no one cares no one gives a
[2015.16 - 2020.60] heck and then our brains are still
[2017.72 - 2022.28] shrinking our brains are still rotting
[2020.60 - 2023.88] cells are being filled with Metals
[2022.28 - 2025.52] pathogens are creating hashimotos
[2023.88 - 2028.72] thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis
[2025.52 - 2031.00] fibromyalgia mecfs lime disease multiple
[2028.72 - 2032.56] sclerosis that's just a name a few exmos
[2031.00 - 2034.68] psoriasis that's just a name a few
[2032.56 - 2036.84] that's nothing I mean I can go a 100
[2034.68 - 2038.20] illnesses there's lupus there's all of
[2036.84 - 2040.12] them them and that's I mean that's just
[2038.20 - 2042.84] a few of
[2040.12 - 2046.00] them if you if you know a name of one
[2042.84 - 2048.12] then yeah it's that and in the book
[2046.00 - 2049.48] celery juice book I cover almost 200
[2048.12 - 2050.76] different symptoms and conditions and
[2049.48 - 2053.80] there what what's happening what the
[2050.76 - 2056.24] cause is and what celery juice is
[2053.80 - 2058.28] doing severe mental and physical
[2056.24 - 2061.56] deterioration such as Alzheimer's ALS
[2058.28 - 2063.56] and Parkinson's metals can cause that
[2061.56 - 2066.48] metals and
[2063.56 - 2068.08] pathogens so this is all important
[2066.48 - 2070.48] information it's critical to know how
[2068.08 - 2073.76] does celery juice help celery juices
[2070.48 - 2076.04] antioxidants help prevent toxic heavy
[2073.76 - 2079.08] metals from decaying by removing the
[2076.04 - 2082.40] fatty deposits from around the heavy
[2079.08 - 2085.16] metal deposit and then coating the
[2082.40 - 2088.00] metals to discourage oxidation that's
[2085.16 - 2090.32] what these antioxidants do sodium
[2088.00 - 2093.28] cluster salts attached to celery juices
[2090.32 - 2095.44] antioxidant diffusing toxic toxic heavy
[2093.28 - 2096.96] metals destructive charge toxic heavy
[2095.44 - 2099.92] metals have a destructive charge in in
[2096.96 - 2102.00] the body rendering these Metals much
[2099.92 - 2104.56] less aggressive when you have the sodium
[2102.00 - 2106.76] cluster salt involved so toxic heavy
[2104.56 - 2110.72] metals have a destructive charge a
[2106.76 - 2113.32] sodium cluster salt attaches itself to
[2110.72 - 2117.00] the antioxidant and celery juice both of
[2113.32 - 2119.20] these two chemical compounds diffuse the
[2117.00 - 2120.76] top the Mercury and the aluminum and the
[2119.20 - 2123.88] copper the destructive charge that
[2120.76 - 2125.88] occurs from those rendering them less
[2123.88 - 2127.40] aggressive this this isn't any any
[2125.88 - 2129.48] information you can find out there this
[2127.40 - 2132.16] is from the celeres book this is from my
[2129.48 - 2135.04] source this is untampered with this
[2132.16 - 2136.76] information it's pure it's clean there's
[2135.04 - 2140.04] no agendas behind
[2136.76 - 2143.36] it so this destructive charge is
[2140.04 - 2146.48] neutralized celery juice is special
[2143.36 - 2147.88] antioxidants can stop oxidation much
[2146.48 - 2150.12] more
[2147.88 - 2152.00] effectively and that's the difference
[2150.12 - 2154.72] between those antioxidants and other
[2152.00 - 2156.76] ones let's talk about Alzheimer's let's
[2154.72 - 2158.12] talk about dementia let's talk about
[2156.76 - 2161.04] memory issues a little bit these are
[2158.12 - 2164.40] diseases we all fear of falling into as
[2161.04 - 2166.84] we age and medical research and science
[2164.40 - 2169.76] has no answers to them they don't have
[2166.84 - 2171.08] any answers to them I know that in it's
[2169.76 - 2173.40] really good-hearted people in the
[2171.08 - 2174.68] alternative Sciences are actually trying
[2173.40 - 2176.28] to get people to eat better with
[2174.68 - 2178.12] Alzheimer's and try to reverse some of
[2176.28 - 2181.76] the symptoms and then they they wave a
[2178.12 - 2184.64] flag like oh my God we did it like by
[2181.76 - 2187.44] golly we did it we did it we can do we
[2184.64 - 2189.44] can do something now we can do uh series
[2187.44 - 2191.36] or a documentary on this or maybe we can
[2189.44 - 2193.60] write a new book or maybe whatever we're
[2191.36 - 2196.00] getting people a little bit better by
[2193.60 - 2198.96] getting them off of processed foods I
[2196.00 - 2200.16] mean that's great that's great it still
[2198.96 - 2201.48] has nothing to do with what's really
[2200.16 - 2202.44] causing the problem how to get the
[2201.48 - 2205.48] problem
[2202.44 - 2207.52] remedied and not just being on the high
[2205.48 - 2209.16] fat diet by just reducing processed
[2207.52 - 2213.24] foods because it's not going to end the
[2209.16 - 2215.20] problem it's not we are just victims to
[2213.24 - 2217.60] these diseases that completely can they
[2215.20 - 2219.68] strip us of the most precious
[2217.60 - 2221.28] memories where we can't even recognize
[2219.68 - 2223.08] our own family anymore sure and if we
[2221.28 - 2224.80] could reverse that a little bit by E
[2223.08 - 2226.40] eating cleaner it's it's a wonderful
[2224.80 - 2227.84] thing but we got to do better than that
[2226.40 - 2228.84] with all these different illnesses all
[2227.84 - 2232.00] of
[2228.84 - 2234.96] them because we can't just hang our hat
[2232.00 - 2237.20] on that where we clean up some diets a
[2234.96 - 2239.76] little bit we need this Advanced
[2237.20 - 2242.64] information about how metals are rotting
[2239.76 - 2244.20] and rusting in the brain and in the body
[2242.64 - 2245.68] and in the tissue and in the liver and
[2244.20 - 2248.16] other places of the body and how to get
[2245.68 - 2250.76] those Metals out that's what we
[2248.16 - 2252.88] need and people don't even know metals
[2250.76 - 2254.24] are causing these problems out there the
[2252.88 - 2255.88] industry doesn't even know they don't
[2254.24 - 2258.00] even believe metals are really causing
[2255.88 - 2259.88] these problems with the brain it's still
[2258.00 - 2263.32] where no one really
[2259.88 - 2266.04] knows and that's a devastating place to
[2263.32 - 2268.00] be memory issues can occur in many
[2266.04 - 2270.76] different ways whether in the form of
[2268.00 - 2273.28] trouble receiving long-term memories
[2270.76 - 2275.92] losing short-term memories or even
[2273.28 - 2279.40] fluctuations or short-term and long-term
[2275.92 - 2283.40] memory issues flip back and forth it's
[2279.40 - 2286.16] important to know the bottom line is we
[2283.40 - 2288.68] have to get the metals out so we're not
[2286.16 - 2290.88] dealing with problems it's
[2288.68 - 2292.64] critical you know we're talking about
[2290.88 - 2294.00] more than those days when you're busy
[2292.64 - 2296.12] and you're just misplacing your
[2294.00 - 2297.72] belongings your car keys maybe even
[2296.12 - 2300.56] forgetting where you parked at a busy
[2297.72 - 2303.84] shopping center although celery juice
[2300.56 - 2307.00] helps with that kind of problem
[2303.84 - 2309.88] too you know it does weigh more than
[2307.00 - 2312.28] that it does more than what we forget in
[2309.88 - 2314.96] a day where we have so many different
[2312.28 - 2317.12] tasks and so many things on our plate
[2314.96 - 2320.24] when we talk about memory issues such as
[2317.12 - 2322.04] alz Alzheimer's disease or dementia what
[2320.24 - 2324.24] we're talking about without real
[2322.04 - 2325.44] realizing it is toxic heavy metals are
[2324.24 - 2327.80] inside the brain that's what we're
[2325.44 - 2330.12] talking about without realizing it that
[2327.80 - 2332.28] toxic heavy metals are sitting inside
[2330.12 - 2334.32] the brain that's what's going on with
[2332.28 - 2338.28] Alzheimer's disease and
[2334.32 - 2340.44] dementia the most common being Mercury
[2338.28 - 2344.76] the other one being aluminum close
[2340.44 - 2347.32] Runners up copper nickel cadmium lead
[2344.76 - 2348.72] and Arsenic and here's the thing you
[2347.32 - 2350.56] guys like this is really important to
[2348.72 - 2352.48] know right here if you want to know a
[2350.56 - 2355.12] really good piece of information I
[2352.48 - 2358.52] nobody knows everybody has a different
[2355.12 - 2362.04] volume a different level of toxic heavy
[2358.52 - 2364.44] metals in the brain in different
[2362.04 - 2366.88] combinations with some metals directly
[2364.44 - 2372.40] Crossing each other's paths which makes
[2366.88 - 2374.88] them interact causing depression anxiety
[2372.40 - 2377.72] anxiousness causing
[2374.88 - 2381.60] bipolar causing
[2377.72 - 2383.60] Mania causing schizophrenia causing just
[2381.60 - 2386.76] regular mild depression that's
[2383.60 - 2389.32] unexplainable causing unexplainable
[2386.76 - 2391.64] sadness then we end up at a psychiatr
[2389.32 - 2393.56] psychiatrist office went up at a psych
[2391.64 - 2396.20] doctor's office and they're just trying
[2393.56 - 2398.00] to like go through a childhood and stuff
[2396.20 - 2400.44] when when are sadness and depression is
[2398.00 - 2401.56] metals that are just basically fusing to
[2400.44 - 2404.88] each
[2401.56 - 2406.52] other and you know it's amazing how it
[2404.88 - 2408.60] works we end up taking some you know
[2406.52 - 2410.24] psych meds that we that we need to to
[2408.60 - 2412.00] survive because some of these some of
[2410.24 - 2413.20] the people some of these doctors they're
[2412.00 - 2415.64] like I don't I don't know what else to
[2413.20 - 2417.40] offer you and and the people they need
[2415.64 - 2419.20] something to get them by so I don't
[2417.40 - 2421.48] blame anybody for using anything they've
[2419.20 - 2423.00] had to use but then the medications have
[2421.48 - 2425.64] more Metals in them and then they end up
[2423.00 - 2427.28] in in liver and the medications and the
[2425.64 - 2429.96] metals end up in the liver it's just not
[2427.28 - 2432.36] an easy path and I completely understand
[2429.96 - 2434.36] I mean so many people struggle and
[2432.36 - 2436.84] suffer it's
[2434.36 - 2439.76] unbelievable memory issues occur when
[2436.84 - 2442.72] those Metals oxidize when they Collide
[2439.76 - 2446.00] when they cross when the paths are cross
[2442.72 - 2449.64] oxidizing Metals lead to a discharge a
[2446.00 - 2453.04] very potent one think about a patch of
[2449.64 - 2455.60] metal rusting on an old car when cars
[2453.04 - 2457.96] were metal I mean so many young people
[2455.60 - 2459.64] listening to this podcast that you know
[2457.96 - 2462.24] they just think cars aren't you know
[2459.64 - 2464.40] they don't know what cars are cars are
[2462.24 - 2467.20] plastic we drive around with plastic
[2464.40 - 2469.52] cars now they're fiber fiberglass and
[2467.20 - 2471.40] plastic so they're not metal anymore I
[2469.52 - 2473.28] mean they're metal inside the frame and
[2471.40 - 2475.84] the parts but the outside of the cars
[2473.28 - 2478.40] are just basically plastic shells
[2475.84 - 2481.44] fiberglass shells but think about the
[2478.40 - 2482.84] metal rusting on a car becoming crusty
[2481.44 - 2486.32] and bubbling
[2482.84 - 2489.00] up if you're old enough to know that
[2486.32 - 2493.04] this is essentially what happens in the
[2489.00 - 2495.24] brain but on a microscopic or nanoscopic
[2493.04 - 2498.20] scale and even smaller than that one
[2495.24 - 2500.92] major cause of oxidative reaction is a
[2498.20 - 2503.92] high level fat in the bloodstream so we
[2500.92 - 2504.84] pound down the fats and we get ourselves
[2503.92 - 2507.56] in
[2504.84 - 2510.28] trouble sure though if you're on a
[2507.56 - 2513.48] really bad diet and you're eating fried
[2510.28 - 2516.64] greasy food with you know rolls with
[2513.48 - 2519.84] butter on it and lots of you know wheat
[2516.64 - 2521.92] gluten and you're eating lots of dairy
[2519.84 - 2524.40] that's been you know melted cheese on
[2521.92 - 2527.24] everything and fried in the oven and I
[2524.40 - 2528.68] mean fried on the stove and baked in the
[2527.24 - 2530.40] oven or whatever all these different
[2528.68 - 2533.28] delicious dishes at all these different
[2530.40 - 2536.52] fast food restaurants or whatever and
[2533.28 - 2538.56] all this all this fair and you're eating
[2536.52 - 2540.00] all that all this time and you switch
[2538.56 - 2541.92] off of that and you're just eating
[2540.00 - 2543.80] almond butters in your your in your
[2541.92 - 2545.08] shakes almond butter and your shakes and
[2543.80 - 2547.76] you're doing coconut oil and you're
[2545.08 - 2550.64] doing Lots of avocado and you're doing
[2547.76 - 2552.52] Freer range chicken and you're doing you
[2550.64 - 2554.04] know some n different seeds and Seed
[2552.52 - 2557.24] oils and you're doing all these things
[2554.04 - 2558.56] and you're you know your your chia seeds
[2557.24 - 2562.32] and you're doing the hemp seeds you're
[2558.56 - 2563.92] doing all of this hemp milk almond milk
[2562.32 - 2565.60] and you're just totally in the high-fat
[2563.92 - 2567.48] diet you got rid of the processed foods
[2565.60 - 2570.36] you got rid of the breads you got rid of
[2567.48 - 2572.56] all of that it's a huge step and that's
[2570.36 - 2575.08] where the world's going where it's going
[2572.56 - 2576.84] all there all the diets are going to
[2575.08 - 2578.52] lead everybody that there and we're
[2576.84 - 2580.44] still going to be S we're still going to
[2578.52 - 2583.28] be sick and
[2580.44 - 2585.04] then basically the diet makers to these
[2583.28 - 2587.16] diets are going to be like well you're
[2585.04 - 2588.40] just you know that's just you something
[2587.16 - 2589.84] something else you're doing you're just
[2588.40 - 2593.72] doing something wrong if this diet
[2589.84 - 2595.92] didn't cure you no it's not at all you
[2593.72 - 2598.08] can only go so far when you remove the
[2595.92 - 2599.64] processed foods because you're still
[2598.08 - 2601.56] doing the high fats you're just doing
[2599.64 - 2603.32] them in a healthier way and it may not
[2601.56 - 2606.28] be enough for so many people who have
[2603.32 - 2609.88] real real issues the Epstein bar and the
[2606.28 - 2611.80] shingles tal neuralgia pler fasciitis
[2609.88 - 2613.32] fibromyalgia you know all the problems
[2611.80 - 2615.48] we get and the reproductive problems
[2613.32 - 2617.92] women get PCOS and fibroids and all that
[2615.48 - 2620.96] that doesn't go away with that we got to
[2617.92 - 2623.84] lower the fats and then the metals don't
[2620.96 - 2625.84] oxidize too I don't care I mean if your
[2623.84 - 2627.92] diet's filled with high quality oils
[2625.84 - 2631.00] nuts and seeds and avocados and and high
[2627.92 - 2633.48] quality age cheese and and and organic
[2631.00 - 2638.52] eggs and chicken and really good fish
[2633.48 - 2640.96] and and and grass-fed beef it's all fat
[2638.52 - 2643.16] all that was fat right there under the G
[2640.96 - 2645.00] or the hidden hidden name of protein all
[2643.16 - 2646.28] under the hidden name of protein all
[2645.00 - 2648.60] somebody's going to think is there is
[2646.28 - 2649.76] protein except for the word oils but
[2648.60 - 2651.16] they're just going to think protein with
[2649.76 - 2653.76] every word I just
[2651.16 - 2655.36] said sure there's no hydrogenated oils
[2653.76 - 2656.72] and cakes and cookies anymore in so of
[2655.36 - 2658.76] these people's diets and donuts and
[2656.72 - 2660.40] other fried foods of course there isn't
[2658.76 - 2662.92] and both the vegan side and both the
[2660.40 - 2664.76] animal pro protein side anymore the
[2662.92 - 2666.92] resulting fat though in the bloodstream
[2664.76 - 2670.40] leads to this oxidative reaction with
[2666.92 - 2672.76] the heavy metals in the brain that means
[2670.40 - 2675.64] all these other fats I'm talking about
[2672.76 - 2677.20] the healthy Ones Still oxidize Metals
[2675.64 - 2678.76] whether anybody likes it or not it's
[2677.20 - 2682.36] just the way it
[2678.76 - 2685.32] is and all these fats thicken up the
[2682.36 - 2687.32] blood lower the oxygen levels in the
[2685.32 - 2689.36] blood and get you in trouble with
[2687.32 - 2691.00] pathogens like Epstein bar and some of
[2689.36 - 2693.40] these some of these fats feed Epstein
[2691.00 - 2694.76] bar like the cheese and the eggs
[2693.40 - 2696.68] especially the cheese and the eggs they
[2694.76 - 2699.20] just feed the Epstein bar
[2696.68 - 2701.00] keep you sick it's why so many people
[2699.20 - 2702.48] have been just Ring Around the Rosie in
[2701.00 - 2706.20] musical
[2702.48 - 2708.64] chairs I'm not trying to cause all the
[2706.20 - 2710.96] fear around healthy fats a little is
[2708.64 - 2713.24] okay too much can cause problems for
[2710.96 - 2715.40] people that are really struggling look
[2713.24 - 2718.72] I've always been the
[2715.40 - 2721.64] person as the messenger as the person
[2718.72 - 2722.80] The Fighter for the chronically ill that
[2721.64 - 2725.08] have tried
[2722.80 - 2726.60] everything and have been there for them
[2725.08 - 2728.24] watching their back
[2726.60 - 2729.20] or to make sure people don't get sick
[2728.24 - 2731.76] and get
[2729.20 - 2734.12] worse you know who've never been sick
[2731.76 - 2735.84] before and end up getting sick and
[2734.12 - 2737.36] getting worse because they don't know
[2735.84 - 2739.76] this Advanced
[2737.36 - 2742.72] information and they just fall they fall
[2739.76 - 2746.20] prey to just a Ring Around The Rosy all
[2742.72 - 2747.64] of all of the same old thing going on
[2746.20 - 2749.36] and no one's telling them we got to get
[2747.64 - 2752.32] the metals deep out of the tissue and
[2749.36 - 2754.08] how to do it the right way none of that
[2752.32 - 2758.08] I'm not trying to cause the fear around
[2754.08 - 2761.28] it it's just basically your safety
[2758.08 - 2763.92] you're protective protecting you making
[2761.28 - 2766.92] sure I look out for you when these
[2763.92 - 2769.60] Metals rust they change shape and form
[2766.92 - 2771.36] they rupture they even grow they expand
[2769.60 - 2774.24] they run together that's how it works
[2771.36 - 2776.28] inside our brains celery juice has an
[2774.24 - 2779.32] electrolyte Source the best one on the
[2776.28 - 2781.56] planet nothing can surpass it it's
[2779.32 - 2783.76] helpful it repairs damaged cells it
[2781.56 - 2786.36] repairs damaged
[2783.76 - 2788.92] neurons for one thing celery jues
[2786.36 - 2791.08] complex blend of trace minerals for one
[2788.92 - 2793.08] thing I'll tell you right now those
[2791.08 - 2795.28] trace minerals are powerful they help
[2793.08 - 2796.88] restore neurotransmitter chemicals this
[2795.28 - 2799.64] is critical
[2796.88 - 2801.36] information the blend offers complete
[2799.64 - 2803.08] neurotransmitter chemicals that's the
[2801.36 - 2805.28] blend in celery juice the blend of
[2803.08 - 2807.72] electrolytes it's critical because it
[2805.28 - 2810.40] helps to stop rusting metals from
[2807.72 - 2812.24] oxidizing and running off that's how
[2810.40 - 2814.08] incredible it
[2812.24 - 2816.76] is
[2814.08 - 2819.96] neurotransmitters it cleans them gets
[2816.76 - 2822.48] them less dirty makes them more useful
[2819.96 - 2825.44] rehydrates them because of electrolyte
[2822.48 - 2827.60] power and celery juice for another
[2825.44 - 2830.60] celery for another thing celery juice
[2827.60 - 2833.56] does it stops the oxidative
[2830.60 - 2836.24] runoff it protects the neurons from the
[2833.56 - 2838.28] runoff the gleo cells in the brain all
[2836.24 - 2841.44] this is critical I talk about this in
[2838.28 - 2843.04] the celery juice book way more I cover
[2841.44 - 2846.28] way more in the C juice book than I can
[2843.04 - 2847.72] cover in a radio show like this
[2846.28 - 2849.68] and the thing is you want to get these
[2847.72 - 2851.52] Metals out that's why I've always
[2849.68 - 2853.76] offered the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2851.52 - 2855.16] which has always helped people I like
[2853.76 - 2857.20] offering the celery juice as one of the
[2855.16 - 2860.08] medical medium tools and then the heavy
[2857.20 - 2862.64] metal detox smoothie the medical medium
