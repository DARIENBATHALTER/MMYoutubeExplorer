00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
the chicken the chicken's body isn't

377
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
like i'm gonna produce a whole bunch of

378
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
vitamin b's for

379
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,959
for humans to eat me the vitamin b's

380
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,560
don't convert by your liver

381
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,560
you can't convert the bees in eggs you

382
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
can't

383
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
you guys are we going to take today's

384
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,279

protein person you can add animal

393
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,720
protein to your salad if that's what you

394
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
really want but i try to keep the fats

395
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
low because guess what

396
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,360

the wall

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,760
if i was a fly on the wall i'd be

400
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,000
watching you guys eat all this fat

401
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,279

there going hey

410
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
unbelievable so that's why i want you

412
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279

um ddd i finally feel like um i lost a

415
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,199
comment it went flying up

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,279
i finally feel like i'm hearing the food

417
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
truth for the first time needy i'm

418
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,199
honored you're here

419
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,959
incredible thank you for being here okay

420
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
see you guys

421
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,480
all right let's talk about a little bit

422
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,199
so how

423
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
viruses work well you're going to hear

424
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,360
out there that

425
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
bugs like viruses are dead they're just

426
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
these

427
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,360
strands these rna strands or

428
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,279
they're just an essence in our system

429
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
that bugs are dead we'll tell that to

430
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,480
somebody with simplex one who doesn't

431
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,839
somebody with simplex one okay when you

432
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,120
get the fever blister

433
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,440
right you go you go kissing somebody

434
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
with that fever blister guess what's

435
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,880
gonna happen

436
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,720
that virus is alive that virus is alive

437
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
and when you go kissing somebody and

438
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
they kiss you

439
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,360
uh they're gonna have that virus

440
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,320
that's how it works okay viruses are

441
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
alive

442
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
they're not dead but it's about snowing

443
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,560
people let smoke and mirror

444
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,639
let's snow the heck out of people let's

445
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
know them snow them snow them

446
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
and that's what they do out there say

447
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,120
viruses aren't alive

448
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,199
that's why with the flu virus if you

449
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,519
sneeze the virus comes out of you

450
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,480
and it lands on a table it

451
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,040
eventually dies okay it eventually dies

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
it's

453
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,000
it's away from if it's on the table on a

454
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,800
counter it's a way for moisture

455
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
it can't get the moisture it needs to

456
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
stay

457
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,959
alive okay it can't eat

458
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,040
it can't what happens is oxygen touches

459
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,399
it so here's how viruses work

460
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,480
oxygen keeps them down

461
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:16,320
oxygen direct oxygen kills viruses right

462
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,800
kills bugs kills pathogens direct

463
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
oxygen right our bloodstream is in

464
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
direct oxygen

465
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,639
okay it's not it's not filled with

466
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
oxygen it's

467
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,360
partially filled with oxygen

468
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,160
not it's not enough to kill off the bugs

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,079
the oxygen we breathe as it goes into

470
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
our lungs and into our bloodstream

471
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,440
okay and the reason why

472
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,880
bugs really thrive too is we're eating

473
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
so much fat

474
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,320
we're eating so much fat the more fat

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,920
you

476
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
eat right okay the thicker your blood

477
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,000
gets and the less

478
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,199
oxygen is in your blood that's how it

479
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,639
works

480
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,759
so then viruses right proliferate that

481
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,800
they grow

482
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,600
they explode they expand they grow in

483
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,360
numbers

484
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,559
so then the viruses grow in numbers the

485
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,919
next thing you know you got another

486
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
virus i lost all the

487
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
little bugs i had around here but next

488
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
thing you got two

489
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,720
and then you got three and that's how

490
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,000
they work

491
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,360
um but the bottom line is

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,559
viruses multiply as the oxygen

493
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,679
levels drop a little bit in your

494
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
bloodstream

495
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,480
okay it's it's on a very very tight

496
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,000
scale

497
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,799
but it drops viruses like to hide in

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,200
fat they love to hide in your blood they

499
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,799
like to hide in fat so if a virus

500
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,280
is in the blood it likes high fat if

501
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,360
if your liver starts to get fatty it

502
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,600
likes to hide in the liver and all that

503
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,799
fat that's what viruses like to do

504
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,880
because the more

505
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,480
fatty your liver gets the more bugs can

506
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
thrive in your liver because there's

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,280
less

508
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
oxygen in a stagnant sluggish liver and

509
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
that's the breeding ground

510
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,120
for viruses the breeding ground for

511
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,080
viruses is the liver

512
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,760
and the liver loses oxygen even if your

513
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
bloodstream has a decent amount of

514
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,760
oxygen

515
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
your liver okay your liver can get all

516
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,600
stagnant sluggish and

517
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,799
fatty and the oxygen levels in the liver

518
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,039
decrease

519
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,799
so the viruses thrive and they gain

520
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,520
strength in numbers

521
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,360
that's how that works and then when

522
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,000
you're eating something like eggs

523
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
you're feeding the virus so let's talk

524
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
about that for a second if you guys just

525
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
came on

526
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
spinach cilantro gonna make food gonna

527
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,160
make a salad in a minute

528
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,160
um talking about some cool stuff here so

529
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,679
why do viruses

530
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:52,400
feed on eggs when they

531
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:55,840
don't feed on meat

532
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
they don't feed on meat why do they feed

533
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,600
on

534
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,200
eggs they feed on eggs because eggs are

535
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,480
an

536
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,640
underdeveloped protein

537
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:11,440
underdeveloped the other thing is

538
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,080
an egg does not have an immune system

539
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
so if you saw the video right that

540
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,679
michelle was talking about not the egg

541
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
thing again if you saw the tick tock

542
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,720
video right you guys

543
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,000
well those eggs had the top of the egg

544
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
was cut off

545
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
in the tick tock video and then i had

546
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
i had a syringe right this is this is

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
really just for talking about the blood

548
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,000
draw but i had a syringe

549
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
and i was putting in some viruses into

550
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,440
the tops of the eggs

551
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,559
during that video and viruses can thrive

552
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,760
in a living egg a raw egg

553
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,480
can thrive and grow in numbers because

554
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,000
there's no immune system in the in that

555
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,280
raw egg

556
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,840
just like a baby doesn't have an immune

557
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,679
system yet in the womb

558
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,280
just like that okay something that's

559
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,840
really important to know but the egg is

560
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,000
obviously different than a baby

561
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,480
but the egg doesn't have its own immune

562
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
system the other thing is

563
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,159
is that the egg the underdeveloped

564
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,159
protein so the proteins are

565
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
underdeveloped they're not a full

566
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
complete

567
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,880
protein like in a piece of meat it's

568
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,919
already been formed so protein that's in

569
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,080
any kind of meat right so

570
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120
the virus doesn't feed on that it's

571
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,159
learned to feed

572
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,200
on the egg okay so that's

573
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
tissue of an animal or another food by

574
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,039
itself

575
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,720
won't won't allow the the virus to

576
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,320
proliferate that's important too

577
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,840
so this is really good information to

578
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,559
keep in mind so we need

579
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,320
when we eat our eggs we're eating our

580
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
eggs right

581
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
and that's why they used eggs because of

582
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,480
these reasons i'm telling you but so

583
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
when we eat our eggs

584
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,559
and we're already got problems right we

585
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
got the chronic fatigue syndrome we got

586
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,320
the depression

587
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
we got the endometriosis we got the pcos

588
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,799
we got

589
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,480
uh the fibroids we got any kind of

590
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,039
problems that we have

591
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,000
right anything like eczema psoriasis

592
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
fibromyalgia

593
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,240
lupus right thyroid disease thyroid

594
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,720
disorders hypothyroidism

595
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,840
i could go on and on and on right lupus

596
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,240
lyme disease

597
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,159
multiple sclerosis ra sarcoidosis

598
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,840
we can go on all day autoimmune

599
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,280
autoimmune autoimmune

600
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,640
okay and what that is is those are bugs

601
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,880
those are viruses those are epstein-barr

602
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,320
so when we eat our eggs when we're doing

603
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,039
that okay

604
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,679
the bugs will eat the eggs inside of us

605
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,240
we

606
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
put the eggs in we swallow them they go

607
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
through a process

608
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,600
and then the bugs love to feed on the

609
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
eggs now if you're healthy you don't

610
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
have much

611
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
going on yet you don't have a lot of

612
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,200
bugs you could eat eggs for years

613
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,559
you know it could be that person that

614
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,840
eats them and you're not getting sick

615
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,919
and then all of a sudden now

616
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,799
you're hypothyroid all of a sudden you

617
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
got hot flashes heart palpitations see

618
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
that's how it works covering a little

619
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,840
egg information let's start cooking a

620
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,200
little bit

621
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,919
you call it cooking making a salad

622
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,720
can't let the virus go living in an

623
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,280
animal

624
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
because they can't have the they can't

625
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,480
have the virus

626
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,480
sit inside a living animal because of

627
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
the living animal's immune system will

628
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,640
work on beating it down

629
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,880
okay an animal has its own immune system

630
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
that's how it works so they grow the

631
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,559
viruses

632
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
in eggs then when they're released into

633
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,960
the environment

634
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,640
like they have been on us they get in us

635
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,880
and our immune system controls them okay

636
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
controls them unless we break down with

637
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
all the triggers i talked about

638
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,360
that's how it's done all right

639
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,280
and um until eventually and see what

640
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,880
happens is too is they need the egg to

641
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,039
keep the virus in the egg like

642
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,640
just like in the video right in the labs

643
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,400
they put the viruses in the egg because

644
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
they can control the environment

645
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
it's just that egg you put the virus

646
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
into a living animal you can't control

647
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
it anymore it's gone

648
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
you got the living animal's immune

649
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,440
system working on it

650
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,799
it's lost in the living animal itself

651
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
it's different than when you have it

652
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,360
controlled in this little tiny micro

653
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,320
environment anyway okay all right all

654
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,960
right all right all right

655
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,960
it comes down to just this what

656
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,919
what do i have lyme disease oh no

657
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,440
multiple sclerosis

658
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,720
fibromyalgia too r.a

659
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,320
i got autoimmune i have that

660
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,600
um okay all right

661
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,919
don't eat eggs what about getting oxygen

662
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,440
through

663
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,840
food great hydrogen peroxides not enough

664
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,080
i'm not a fan of it uh polly good

665
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,919
question though

666
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,240
i'm gonna make some good stuff um very

667
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,760
good live today hey thanks it's a good

668
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,799
live because i got you guys here and

669
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
that's what makes it good

670
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,919
can you imagine if you guys weren't here

671
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,279
and i was just doing this myself

672
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,279
it would be a bad live

673
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,320
um caney i got canker sores from two

674
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,760
weeks of eating raw

675
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,840
and fat free and i'm still super bloated

676
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
um what else are you doing are you raw

677
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,360
and fat free

678
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,000
be your own detective i want you to be

679
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,039
able to be your own detective here okay

680
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,159
all right so um first of all uh no

681
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,880
nutritional yeast

682
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,640
i'm assuming no apples no raw apple

683
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,120
cider vinegar

684
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,760
raw apple cider vinegar do people eat

685
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,760
raw

686
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
and they do apple cider vinegar just

687
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,600
keep that in mind

688
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
apple cider vinegar not good natural

689
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,240
flavors

690
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
what natural flavors are in your

691
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,039
supplementation what natural flavors are

692
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
in your raw kale chips

693
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,480
that you might have bought in a package

694
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,240
what natural flavors

695
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,320
look out for that it's a nutritional

696
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,159
yeast apple cider vinegar

697
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,200
natural flavors keep in mind citric acid

698
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,480
not an orange put citric acid that's in

699
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
all kinds of products

700
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,080
all kinds of foods all kinds of

701
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,919
supplements keep in mind for that

702
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,120
one too i want you to be your own

703
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,600
detective

704
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,320
very important okay so that that that

705
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,600
alone is is critical right

706
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,640
and now canker virus is already in your

707
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,039
system

708
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,960
so you never got a canker sore ever

709
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,559
before in your life or is this the first

710
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,320
time you got a canker sore

711
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
if it's the first time you got a canker

712
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,960
store that broke out okay

713
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,480
where did it come from did it was it's a

714
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
recent exposure

715
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,840
which happens to people it's trying to

716
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
get you to be your own detective that's

717
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,200
important to know

718
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,799
um and you got to keep in mind that

719
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,919
you're starting to cleanse

720
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,080
so when you're starting to cleanse

721
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,840
you're getting rid of all that sludge

722
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,640
all that stuff inside the liver inside

723
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,440
the body the other thing is um

724
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,559
you know it it's it's you're off fat all

725
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,919
together

726
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,840
so and totally fat free keep in mind

727
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,520
there's no oils there's no avocados look

728
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
out for all of that that's something

729
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
that could be helpful

730
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,960
um so all these things are key and i

731
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,080
think you're off the fat i'm pretty sure

732
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,880
you said that right

733
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
but you never had any bloating before

734
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
are you trying to are you you're trying

735
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
to fix everything in two weeks

736
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
why are you even doing it you must have

737
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,120
had problems so ask yourself

738
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,200
were you bloated ever before in your

739
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,159
life did you ever have a kinky sword in

740
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
your life

741
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,880
were you ever were you ever sick did you

742
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
have any symptoms because people don't

743
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440
go raw

744
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,880
for two weeks um and just go raw for two

745
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,360
weeks unless they they've been

746
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,480
struggling no one wants to go raw

747
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,039
so and and did you instinctively feel

748
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,320
something was coming like you

749
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,960
instinctively knew

750
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
you had to go raw because something was

751
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,840
on

752
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,039
its way because that happens intuitively

753
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,000
that's how we do it

754
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,000
intuitively we're starting to feel

755
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,520
something we don't we can't line up to

756
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,640
it yet but man i gotta take care of

757
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,039
myself now

758
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,360
i gotta start going raw i gotta start

759
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
taking care of myself now it's intuitive

760
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,960
you know and it's like it's in there

761
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
like

762
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
i gotta start now something was already

763
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,480
on

764
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,240
its way all these things are important

765
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
to keep in mind while you're trying to

766
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
heal

767
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,240
now what i would do is i would

768
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
i would do one of the mono eating

769
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,360
cleanses and cleanse the heel ask your

770
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,559
doctor what's right for you but that's

771
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
what i would do

772
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,760
so i would do one of the mono eating

773
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,799
cleanses i would do papaya

774
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,080
celery juice for a couple of days that's

775
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,399
that's what i would do and

776
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,600
take it one step at a time and then you

777
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,640
don't have to be

778
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,559
all raw meaning that's what i would tell

779
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,600
somebody like a doctor friend asking me

780
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,000
this very question

781
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,760
you can then go to steamed potatoes as

782
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
one of those meals and do the

783
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,039
mono eating cleanse with steamed

784
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
potatoes we've got some steamed potatoes

785
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,080
here

786
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,880
and that's another way of doing things

787
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,399
too

788
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,919
but you know and and so and is it in all

789
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,120
raw from

790
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,480
someone else's all raw like their idea

791
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,880
of all raw or is it the advanced 369

792
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
is it the advanced 369 with all the

793
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,240
direction

794
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,000
and the questions answered and

795
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,600
everything under the sun

796
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
or is it just some raw diet someone says

797
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,440
hey go do this go raw

798
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,600
and or is it to 28 day cleanse right

799
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
is it the 28 day cleanse in medical

800
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,960
medium new addition so these are some

801
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,679
things to keep in mind

802
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,559
because that's going to be very helpful

803
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,799
kirsten

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,840

at apple podcast really important

847
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,640
because that is a really important

848
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,880
podcast right there

849
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
and why is apple cider vinegar that was

850
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
just one it's the teeth destroyer pulls

851
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
calcium out of your teeth and bones it's

852
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,559
the osteopenia creator

853
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,159
apple cider vinegar will dissolve your

854
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,919
teeth you will see it later on

855
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,679
as it destroys your teeth as time goes

856
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,640
on that's what vinegar does acetic acid

857
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
that's just one thing

858
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,919
to say about it could say a lot of other

859
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,320
things there's a question there i wanted

860
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,320
to read i think it went up

861
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,640
um i hate when i see natural flavors so

862
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,559
lena i hate when i see natural flavors

863
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,760
and they don't say what's in it very

864
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,200
misleading

865
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,640
see guys here's how the world works

866
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,760
there's bad people in the world okay

867
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,240
i know there's this whole thing where no

868
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,000
one's bad

869
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,279
no one's bad so gassing six million jews

870
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
was just i guess a mistake because

871
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,200
no one's bad right so i know there's a

872
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,360
new age

873
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,760
vibe of no one's bad okay

874
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,519
oh no they're not bad no one terrible

875
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,519
things don't happen

876
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:15,200
uh people aren't killed all the time um

877
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,600
yeah people aren't like murdered okay

878
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
people are just no there's no bad in the

879
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,200
world i know there's a new age thing

880
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,519
about there's no bad okay

881
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,320
and i just can't just with it all right

882
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,840
and

883
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,240
the bad what it does it extends into

884
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,880
like the msg world which is all your

885
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,799
natural flavors

886
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,399
msg natural flavors

887
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:41,600
flavoring flavors natural flavors

888
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,640
organic flavoring they hide it under

889
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
that term

890
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,760
that's why you don't hear msg anymore

891
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,200
that's why you don't see msg on the

892
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,760
labels right

893
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,519

935
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,200
uh wild blueberry drink are you kidding

936
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,080

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,200
telling everybody and you'll see it on

939
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,480
the last one there is

940
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,960
all your organic produce i washed this

941
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
i washed it that's a zucchini right i

942
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,559
washed

943
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,360
that orange surface of that orange okay

944
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,679
i washed

945
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,559
these organic tomatoes because there's

946
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,320
msg

947
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,399
spray the organic sprays

948
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,679
many times are more toxic than the

949
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,720
conventional

950
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,919
sprays they're loaded with nicotine

951
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,799
and msg you have to wash your organic

952
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,840
produce it's loaded with nicotine and

953
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,840
msg

954
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,919
and what weiman's does is they don't

955
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,240
want everybody addicted to that

956
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
ms sheets an addiction msg is an

957
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,399
addictive

958
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,879
a drug okay nicotine is an addictive

959
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,839
drug

960
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,240
caffeine is an addictive drug those very

961
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,359
three things are in organic sprays they

962
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,599
spray on everything

963
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,679
and weiman's they do this thing where

964
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,639
you can go a long time without any spray

965
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,639
whatsoever then

966
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,240
they'll do one little area and they'll

967
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,000
do another little area and they'll test

968
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,760
for pesticide

969
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,919
residue and they use they use the

970
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,520
non-pollinator

971
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,960
damaging spray right and organic sprays

972
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,159
with all that nicotine

973
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,079
damages pollinators that's what they use

974
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
so people think just because it's

975
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,240
organic means that's it

976
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,280
it's the greatest thing on the planet no

977
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,839
it's not

978
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
they spray the heck out of crops three

979
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,359
times a week

980
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,200
and so the why that's why the wild food

981
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,839
is better than organic and i've said

982
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
that it's

983
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,400
better than organic that's the why men's

984
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,240
wild blueberry juice but anyway

985
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,079
you know it's important to know when it

986
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,400
comes down to that

987
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,680
m-i-a already healed with your

988
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,680
information and now my psoriasis is back

989
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,359
so bad anthony so you already healed one

990
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,440
time and it's back

991
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,599
all right so you know i'll try to do a

992
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
podcast on psoriasis too so that's

993
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,440
important

994
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,800

995
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280

couldn't sell them

1091
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,640
did you know that grocery stores across

1092
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,520
the whole country here in the u.s

1093
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,000

1094
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,920
every week in the dumpsters

1095
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,920
all the grocery stores at a combined

1096
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
equals hundreds of tons over time of

1097
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,040
eggs

1098
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,200
did you know there's people living in

1099
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,640
tent cities and homeless people

1100
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,880

1103
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,040
lost everything

1104
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,320

1105
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,359
the united states

1106
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,280
that doesn't allow hundreds of tons of

1107
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,440
food that's being thrown in dumpsters

1108
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
every single day that doesn't allow them

1109
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,359
to actually give it to the homeless

1110
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,040
did you know that all the homeless in

1111
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,440
this country would be fed

1112
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
and safe and have lots of food if they

1113
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,359
would just

1114
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,000
take the outdated like literally a day

1115
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,960
old

1116
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,079
that's all just one day old of the eggs

1117
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,040
and all the bread

1118
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,440

it's got msg in it not only that it's

1237
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,960
irritating to the lining of the

1238
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
intestinal tract

1239
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,560
so you're ready get ready for this i'm

1240
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,720
doing medical medium i better

1241
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,000
use the pink phone for this one yeah i'm

1242
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,359
doing medical medium

1243
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,880
yeah yeah no i i'm just i just don't i

1244
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,760

1245
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,560
not working for me no it's not

1246
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,560
i should do a post and ruin a whole

1247
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,800
bunch of people's chances of healing

1248
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,920
right i should because medical means not

1249
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,359
working for me

1250
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,520
so then i should probably do an

1251
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,599
instagram post right and then tear down

1252
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,599
the dreams of people healing

1253
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,359
that might be trying it or just starting

1254
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,359
it because i want to be

1255
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:34,160
you know a mean person what am i doing

1256
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,480
i'm doing nutritional yeast really

1257
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,000
that's that's that's not medical medium

1258
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,200
nutritional yeast isn't medical medium

1259
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,680
what do you mean it's not medical medium

1260
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,599
oh i never really read the books

1261
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,599
oh yeah you're right i never really read

1262
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,280
the books and never really learned

1263
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,200
not to do like apple cider vinegar and

1264
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,960
nutritional yeast and everything else

1265
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,960

bunch of people

1268
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,800
because us vegans love our nutritional

1269
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,040
yeast and don't want to let it go

1270
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,560

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,400
you know i was talking about the b12 you

1300
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,760
guys are because i saw one question come

1301
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,160
up about the b12

1302
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,079
the b12 i use is the vimergy b12 because

1303
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,720
i use the vimergy supplements that's the

1304
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,280
ones

1305
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,640
that i only use right now um because i

1306
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,599
trust them the best and it's the best

1307
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,240
stuff out there

1308
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,880
i'm not sponsored by vimergy just so you

1309
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,200
know

1310
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,920
but the when i was talking about like in

1311
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,000
the egg

1312
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,000
everybody's talking about inside the egg

1313
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,680
how you know oh there's bees in there

1314
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
and so forth well first of all there's

1315
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,040
more bees

1316
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,839
inside spinach that actually really get

1317
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,119
to the point

1318
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,119
but if you're somebody that wants to

1319
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,440
take b12 or you're looking for a b12

1320
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,280
there's no b12 better than this that's

1321
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,960
the vimergy these in victor i

1322
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,160
am as in mary ergy so that's just so you

1323
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,760
know the one i take

1324
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,599
that's the best one there is because i

1325
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,559
know that i saw a b12 i thought i saw a

1326
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,160
b

1327
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,319
question come up because of the egg talk

1328
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,359
and i didn't answer it i have a b12

1329
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,359
podcast

1330
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,960
at medical beam podcast at apple podcast

1331
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,839
but i've seen the difference

1332
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,680
between what a real b12 does versus a

1333
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,119
crappy b12 i've seen people with

1334
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,440
fibromyalgia

1335
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,119
turn the corner because they got the

1336
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,160
right b12 i've seen

1337
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,920
people with ra start to get relief

1338
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,359
that's what i've seen when they do the

1339
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,960
right when they've done brought in the

1340
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,520
right b12

1341
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,000
and you know i've seen the change in

1342
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
people

1343
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,280
mentally emotionally physically when

1344
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,680
it's the right b12

1345
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,839
without the natural flavors and without

1346
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,280
the other stuff even the other b12s i've

1347
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,319
noticed that don't have natural flavors

1348
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,599
because they're trying to

1349
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,839
they're you know there's only a couple

1350
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,800
out there that may not have it i noticed

1351
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,720
though it's real

1352
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,720
cheap it comes from a different place

1353
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
it's a cheap version it's not mixed

1354
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,440
right

1355
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,880
but it's like that's what i've noticed

1356
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,800
so i recommend this one for

1357
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,559
for doctors so their patients have a

1358
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,400
higher healing

1359
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,920
factor and that's the one thing so

1360
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,079
that's the vimorji

1361
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,119
with the no natural flavors the whole

1362
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,040
bit

1363
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,480
and so that's the one there the b12

1364
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,880
because i saw that question

1365
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,480
nutritional yeast is vegan crack jenny

1366
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,079
it totally is

1367
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:12,160
it's msg and it's total vegan crap

1368
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:14,559
that's what it is and crack but look

1369
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,640
i always say if you're going to be vegan

1370
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,520
be vegan and be plant-based

1371
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,640
i'm very pro-plant-based okay you guys

1372
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,920
know that right

1373
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,319
but i'm not a vegan propaganda channel

1374
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,359
because i believe if you want to eat

1375
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,839
animal protein

1376
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,200
you can still heal and still do the

1377
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,880
28-day cleanse

1378
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,960
then bring your animal protein back in

1379
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,640
later you need more healing do the

1380
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,720
28-day cleanse again

1381
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,200
then bring the animal protein back in

1382
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,880
later it depends on what's happening

1383
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,960
but keeping the fats down because i've

1384
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,359
seen vegans and plant-based people

1385
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,800
fat themselves to death too much avocado

1386
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,680
nuts seeds and oils

1387
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,200
right and they just can't heal and then

1388
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,000
they're doing nutritional yeast and then

1389
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,079
you're doing apple cider

1390
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,319
vinegar and they're just they can't heal

1391
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,480
and then they they fail

1392
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,920
and then they run back to eating eggs

1393
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,280
again so then now they run back to

1394
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,800
eating eggs now they run

1395
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,040
back to animal protein and i've seen

1396
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,200
animal protein people fail

1397
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,079
when all they had to do was was know

1398
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,079
what to do

1399
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
and they can still keep you know and

1400
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,520
they get sick and then they gotta run

1401
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,319
now vegan like everybody's running back

1402
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,760
and forth

1403
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:23,040
no one has the real answers and it's sad

1404
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,680
so um it's about being

1405
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,720
keeping the radical fats out while

1406
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,640
you're healing

1407
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,240
what from when you're sick and you keep

1408
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,920
the radical fats out

1409
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,599
that's part of it i've seen them all fat

1410
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,960
themselves of death nutritional yeast

1411
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,119
themselves to death

1412
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,319
i've seen it all and it's fine it's like

1413
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,400
well whatever but

1414
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,880
you know do what you want to do and then

1415
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,440
you'll get somebody that's like well

1416
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,119
you know intuitively i think this is

1417
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,480
right for me i feel good about my

1418
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,160
nutritional yeast it's like well your

1419
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,520
intuitive powers really really

1420
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,359
suck because you're not

1421
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,040
you're going to get in trouble you just

1422
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,960
are it's like

1423
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,079
we lose our intuitive abilities that's

1424
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,960
how the system

1425
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,520
we lose because the addiction takes over

1426
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,960
it's like

1427
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,319
it's like it's like people who are

1428
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,359
addicted to caffeine they're eating

1429
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,800
their chocolate all the time they're

1430
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,119
addicted to their matcha tea

1431
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,720
they're addicted to their coffee and

1432
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,640
it's like you know what i mean

1433
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,960
okay i trust your intuitive abilities

1434
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,359
okay you're totally addicted

1435
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,839
to caffeine which is fine but let's just

1436
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,920
not let's just not like get carried away

1437
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,280
and think we got it all down like we got

1438
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,400
all the answers see a lot of people in

1439
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,079
the health scene

1440
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,160
that are doing all that caffeine but

1441
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,040
they're all on their social media

1442
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,359
they're they're all

1443
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,119
experts like experts really and you're

1444
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,520
jacked up on caffeine because you can't

1445
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,480
function without the caffeine

1446
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,599
so um i'm gonna put some potato on here

1447
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
too and that's next

1448
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,040
well let's put some zucchini i didn't

1449
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,640
have cucumbers

1450
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,800
i think i might have them but i couldn't

1451
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,559
i couldn't find them you know but

1452
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,160
in time but i got some zucchinis here

1453
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,280
i'm going to cut the top off i like

1454
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,160
zucchini it's a really great food for so

1455
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,359
many reasons okay

1456
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,800
so what i'm doing is cutting the

1457
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,240
zucchini i'm going to cut it in half

1458
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,920
down the middle like this

1459
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,839
okay and i'm going to cut little pieces

1460
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,800
like this i'm going to put a few of

1461
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,800
these on the salad

1462
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,760
if you want to heal it's good to keep

1463
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,520
the fats down now when your animal

and well then you can bring your

1479
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,359
sardines and you put your sardines on

1480
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,920
your salad instead of your potatoes

1481
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,280
right you if you're into chicken and

1482
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,480
chicken's a thing you eat and you're

1483
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,319
always eating your chicken and stuff

1484
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,240
like that you put a little chicken

1485
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,359
on top of your salad if meat something

1486
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,880
you put a little

1487
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,720
you know little bit of meat or some

1488
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,680
salmon right if you're animal protein

1489
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,720
but remember

1490
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,160
those are fats and if you're still sick

1491
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,480
you want to get to the point where you

1492
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,440
drop the fats again maybe do the 28 day

1493
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,880
cleanse again

1494
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,760
maybe do a 369 like original 369 or

1495
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,800
simplify but you keep the fats kind of

1496
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,280
at bay or

1497
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,440
you do the animal protein once a day and

1498
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,000
if you're vegan you do your avocado once

1499
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,440
a day at

1500
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,240
the end of the day right but keep the

1501
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,319
potatoes

1502
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,920
out if you bring in your avocado because

1503
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,119
you're vegan plant-based and you bring

1504
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,559
in your nut butters because you're vegan

1505
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,319
and plant-based and you're bringing your

1506
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,920
salmon because you're animal-based

1507
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,400
and you bring in whatever it is because

1508
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,200
you're animal-based make sure

1509
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,000
you keep the potatoes out of the picture

1510
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,119

bloodstream doesn't just

1574
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,640
reproduce an immune system comes from

1575
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,680
your bones it doesn't happen overnight

1576
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,839
okay and your blood fills with water you

1577
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,000
can drink water get hydrated and you're

1578
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,200
you're getting the tank full but you're

1579
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,160
missing your

1580
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,640
cbc a big hunk of your cbc they take it

1581
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,880
all

1582
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,480
right they take it all and then your

1583
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,240
immune system goes with it huge trigger

1584
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,720
for chronic illness it keeps the vegan

1585
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,160
sick

1586
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,839
it keeps the plant-based person sick it

1587
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,119
keeps the animal protein sick you lose

1588
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,720
your glucose and electrolytes you're

1589
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,920
sick now you kick back for a week or two

1590
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,920
takes three to six months to get your

1591
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,760
immune system back your cbc

1592
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,960
so i talk about on the podcast what to

1593
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
do i'm not against

1594
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,079
getting your blood taken not against

friends and family they're like what

1598
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,240
should i do and one of the things i

1599
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:50,240
didn't put in the podcast is

1600
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,240
do a shot of wild blueberry juice if you

1601
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,640
had blood draw do a shot every single

1602
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,480
week before weeks after but

1603
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,839
of the wild blueberry juice but the

1604
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,599
description of the blood draw podcast is

1605
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,599
sorry the link is in the description but

1606
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,200
they take way too much blood they take

1607
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,880
way too much of your immune system your

1608
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,960
red blood cell count right they take too

1609
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,119
much and then

1610
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,480
that's when the trigger happens and all

1611
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,000
of a sudden now you get sicker and

1612
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,440
sicker then they take more blood because

1613
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000

vampires

1627
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:51,040

1920
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,800
been following i did i talked about it

1921
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,080
in so many occasions but i guess i had

1922
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,159
to make it the entire

1923
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,280
platform to really get the message out

1924
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,920
yvonne i'm a nurse

1925
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,320
and i understand incredible it really is

1926
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,480
it's incredible

1927
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,679
all right so i got the dressing it's

1928
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,920
done

1929
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,280
i got my salad right here okay and i

1930
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,719
talked about different options you can

1931
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,239
have in here you can put

1932
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,000
if you want animal protein with the

1933
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:32,000
course you can but this is a healing

1934
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,679
meal for when you're healing in the

1935
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,199
moment you can do animal protein another

1936
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,199
day in your life with it

1937
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,719
or if you're if you're plant-based if

1938
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,159
you really want to do a little avocado

1939
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,840
with it or a little tahini or something

1940
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,120
because your plant-based that's okay

1941
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,159
right but but but realize that you know

1942
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,280
if you're working on your healing

1943
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,199
process having a

1944
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,320
no-fat meal sometimes would be really

1945
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,159
good

1946
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,000

1947
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,040
