um grains are

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,360
scratchy though to me michelle l says

90
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,159
yeah well grains

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
are not a big part of medical medium

92
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,720
foods and information

93
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,840
a lot of people have different feelings

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,400
towards them they have different

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
sensations they have different reactions

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,760
the only two grains that i really like

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,440
if someone's gonna do grains are millet

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
which is a really

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
gentle gentle grain that one right there

100
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
and that's what i'm to do

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
or oats those two but i like millet

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
better because

103
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,239
people who are sensitive can do better

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,920
with it if

105
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,560
you want a grain so um

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
so what i'm going to do is take a cup

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
right here of millet

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
so i'm excited about this just dropped a

109
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,239
little bit up and that's

110
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,239
putting it in the pot here

111
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,840
so there we go it's about a cup

112
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
of millet and then i'm going to show you

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
over here i don't know if you guys could

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
see it hopefully

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,000
so that's it in a pot right there

116
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,439
okay and i'm going to add the water two

117
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
cups of water

118
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,799
in here now with millet

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,200
you just got to simmer it for about 25

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
minutes sometimes depending it could

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,519
take a half an hour

122
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,799
i'm going to bring it to a boil simmer

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
it

124
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,199
and what's going to happen it's going to

125
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,520
be this glorious thing i'm going to make

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
millet porridge so basically can be the

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
wild blueberry porridge but with millet

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
instead of oatmeal

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
i'm also going to make the smoothie so i

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
can't wait the apple cinnamon smoothie

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
so

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
let's talk about the morning cleanse a

133
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
little bit glad everybody's here this is

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
exciting

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400
so let's start with the lemon water got

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,160
it right here

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,479
and so

138
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
you can do lemon water you can do lime

139
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,479
water

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,639
i did lime water yesterday i'm cutting a

141
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,520
lemon now

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
over here so it's my lemon as you guys

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,160
can see i don't know how

144
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,360
if you can all right putting half a

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
lemon in here like this

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,280
upon waking 16 to 32 ounces

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,919
of lemon water really important to flush

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
out the liver

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
here's a really important point you can

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
let people know

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
when you see it in the you know when

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,160
people are commenting about it

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
and talking about it this is a critical

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,000
point right here

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,199
you know what it is it's do not use hot

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
water

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
if you use hot water you can't flush the

158
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
liver

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
you cannot flush the liver of the toxins

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
in the morning

161
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,000
to get them out i'll tell you what goes

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,479
wrong when you use

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
hot water this this is a mistake that

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,960
came

165
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:57,039
after medical medium information so

166
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,560
medical medium information was

167
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,440
16 to 32 ounces of lemon water

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
okay squeezed into lukewarm water room

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
temperature water

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
or cold water first thing in the morning

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
to flush

172
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,039
the liver and flush the body of toxins

173
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
it's original medical medium information

174
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
with lemon water

175
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
and what happened was as the years went

176
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,720
on all the teaching

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,160
all the lecturing i did all the teaching

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
different practitioners

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280
doctors throughout the years it the

180
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
lemon water thing caught on to flush

181
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
to actually flush toxins out of the body

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
stemmed from originally from the medical

183
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
medium information but what

184
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,680
something here's what went wrong with

185
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,720
the information somebody said

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,919
do it in hot water well they just ruined

187
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,319
it for a lot of people

188
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,039
so it's it's really becomes a wasted

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
effort

190
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,880
if it's done in hot water now herbal tea

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
is another story because with herbal tea

192
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,319
when you put lemon in herbal

193
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
tea you're doing an herbal extraction

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
and what you're really trying to get out

195
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
of that herbal tea anyway is an herbal

196
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
extraction so that's different but this

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,919
is a different situation right here

198
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,000
so um and

199
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
what people also do another piece of

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,960
information that doesn't work is it not

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,080
only put lemon in

202
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,639
hot water which is not good but

203
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
put lemon in a cup of hot water so have

204
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,440
your lemon water like eight ounces or a

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
cup

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,840
that won't work either so it's basically

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
distorting medical medium information so

208
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
that people

209
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,840
don't get a healing benefit and don't

210
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
move forward

211
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,960
these details are critical the details

212
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,759
matter they matter with getting

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,479
past the finish line they matter with

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,039
actually

215
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,840
really healing and getting yourself

216
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,520
better

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
they really count these details and

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
that's the difference of medical medium

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,400
information versus other

220
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,919
so once again 16 to 32 ounces

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,479
of lemon water for seeing the morning

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,720
upon waking to flush out the liver

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
and the body of toxins okay so that's

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
what you do

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
and then it was distorted as the years

226
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,639
went by

227
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,720
because medical medium information has

228
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,599
gone around the world and then some

229
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
health hacks

230
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,879
in in the health industry or some health

231
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
gurus decided

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
oh no yeah you do your lemon water but

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
put it in hot water

234
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,319
and here's what goes wrong the hot water

235
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
stays in your stomach

236
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
your body will not release hot water

237
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
from your stomach until it cools down

238
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
if it holds onto the lemon too long in

239
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
your stomach

240
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
the lemon will lose its potency the

241
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,800
ability to actually be able to help you

242
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
the second thing is you're destroying

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
the lemons

244
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,080
critical enzymes so a fresh raw

245
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,680
lemon has enzymes that help the process

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
in flushing the liver

247
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,760
that disappears the minute you put it in

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,959
hot water that's the disaster right

249
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,080
there so i just want to give you guys

250
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,000
that rundown so

251
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,839
you do your lemon water then you do your

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:54,080
celery juice

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:57,200
i'm going to grab mine right here

254
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,600
so i got my celery juice that's it

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,279
um not juicy today because i got a lot

256
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,279
of stuff to cook right now

257
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
this has come to a boil pretty much it's

258
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,880
simmering so these

259
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
are this is going to be the wild

260
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,959
blueberry porridge

261
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,600
from millet so i'm using millet this

262
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,120
time

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
millet is a better grain than oats

264
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,920
by far there's a lot there's a lot more

265
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
phytochemical compounds there's a lot

266
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,959
more nutrition in it there's

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
there's um with millet it's gentle on

268
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,720
the intestinal lining

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,519
so it's one of the only grains that's

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,279
actually gentle to the intestinal tract

271
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
and still if someone's sensitive with

272
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,399
grains they don't have to do grains of

273
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,519
course not but i know that a lot of

274
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,920
people do greens

275
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,519
they do them around the holidays they

276
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
they eat bread of course around the

277
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,640
holidays cookies everything else in the

278
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,640
sun

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,560
and i know a lot of people do oatmeal

280
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,360
and oatmeal is okay

281
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,720
but millet is that next step better when

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
it comes down to grain so

283
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,959
i said you know why don't i make the

284
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
wild blueberry porridge with millet

285
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
so you guys have an option i'm turning

286
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
down the burner a little bit you'll see

287
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,680
it

288
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,920
you'll see it cranking in here

289
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
so

290
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,600
there we go so that's what i love i love

291
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,880
showing you guys different options

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,440
so you have other ways to help heal

293
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,440
so i'm going to let this simmer and do

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
its thing

295
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
it's just cranking a little hot so i'm

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
going to take the lid off a little bit

297
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
there we go

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,839
but anyway after the 16 to 32 ounces of

299
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,959
lemon water

300
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,040
you wait 15 to 30 minutes okay

301
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
and you move into celery juice then you

302
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,079
do 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
we'll talk about the power that has as

304
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,360
well so the celery juice

305
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
has a lot going for it a lot more than

306
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
what people know they don't

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
know what's in celery juice they don't

308
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
know what celery juice does for them

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
and one of the best parts about celery

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
juice is it revives your stomach glands

311
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
so you got these two little stomach

312
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,680
glands in your stomach okay

313
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,440
those stomach glands create your hcl

314
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,000
your gastric acid so those stomach

315
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
glands

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
get burnt out in everybody that's why

317
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,800
things go wrong

318
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
when those stomach lands get burned out

319
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,399
you can't produce enough

320
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,200
hcl and that hcl kills off bugs

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,880
pathogens it stops us from bloating that

322
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
hcl

323
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,000
breaks down protein and it

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
stops proteins from rotting and

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,279
putrefying so everybody walks around

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
with low hcl

327
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
hydrochloric acid and then their

328
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
proteins putrefy

329
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
in their gut and start to rot and when

330
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
they start to rot

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
it feeds more bacteria that's not good

332
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,040
bacteria

333
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680
celery juice brings back your stomach

334
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
glands

335
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
allowing them to produce the gastric

336
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,360
acid needed

337
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,720
the hydrochloric acid medical beam

338
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
information is the seven

339
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,560
blend hcl because hcl isn't just one

340
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
acid it's a blend of seven and when you

341
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,279
lose your gastric glands

342
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,200
the gastric gland strength those acids

343
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,600
they weaken and you lose like three of

344
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
the seven four of the seven so your hcl

345
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,079
isn't strong

346
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,440
and uh celery juice brings that

347
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,360
back stabilizes the the stomach glands

348
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
it's a critical part of how we heal with

349
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
the celery juice

350
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
and you'll hear people out there i mean

351
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
there's millions of people drinking it

352
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
they'll be like

353
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
celery's used to help me celery juice is

354
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,600
getting me better celery juice has

355
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,120
helped me you know what my digestion but

356
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
they don't know why it's because those

357
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
little stomach lamps they're really tiny

358
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,639
they're like

359
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
they're like the size of they're smaller

360
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,160
than

361
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519

have melons cut up

426
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
you could have mangoes papayas you can

427
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,920
go with something a little denser

428
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,399
papayas and bananas you can do that

429
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,680

so okay so let's work on this right now

445
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,279
red apples so that's the first thing

447
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,839

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
juice

453
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
drink i do make my own celery juice

454
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120

455
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,079
incredible very amazing so the recipe

456
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
for this

457
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,199
is you get your 16 to 32 ounces of water

458
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,399
you cut

459
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,199
a lemon in half that's one half i just

460
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
squeezed

461
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,560
okay and you squeeze it in there now the

462
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,800
key is don't put it in hot water

463
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,880
don't do the hot water make sure it's 16

464

the morning

466
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,360
that's the key wait 15 to 30 minutes

467
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
before you do the celery juice

468
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,639

[Music]

473
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
just reading some comments at the same

474
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
time

475
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
i gotta do the sporting cleanse

476
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,039
challenge more often because this is

477
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,039
really fun

478
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,039
[Music]

479
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,280
so i just cut that apple if you guys can

480
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,520
see that's the cord

481
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,270
so cut another one i could use this

482
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
knife too

483
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,720
[Music]

484
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,360
you could do it a lot of different i

485
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,280
mean i like using the small knives too

486
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:35,919
so that's that's the way i've done it

487
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
so cutting up the apple so this is two

488
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,339
medium-sized apples

489
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,339
[Music]

490
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,120
you don't want to put the core in

491
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
because you're just going to blend the

492
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,360
seeds up

493
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,880
the seeds are bitter so apple seeds are

494
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
bitter and if you blend that

495
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520
up you're just going to make you're

496
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,559
going to make this smoothie bitter so

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
that's something right there

498
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,120

499
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,480

500
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,559

cinnamon smoothie there it is

519
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
that's the recipe that's what we're

520
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,520
making

521
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,520
it tastes so good

522
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,240
so i'm really excited so i'm going to

523
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,559
put a teaspoon of maple syrup in here

524
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,840
too

525
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,840
just so you know

526
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,000
now you can put a date in there i like i

527
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,039
like the maple syrup so i have this

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,039
maple syrup right here

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
now a teaspoon you could measure i'm

530
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
just going to dump it right in if you

531
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,160
guys don't mind

532
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,960
i put probably a little bit more than a

533
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,760
teaspoon in there

534
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,039
of course and then i'm going to drop

535
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,039
some cinnamon in there now

536
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,080
you got the cinnamon okay and this is

537
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
the recipe out of cleanse to heal just

538
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,480
so you know so i'm going to drop some

539
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
cinnamon in there too

540
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,480
so it's three quarters

541
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,840
three quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon

542
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
this is how to cleanse the heel

543
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
it's a question right there aren't apple

544
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,919
skins

545
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,280
aren't apple skins um

546
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,280
full of pesticides so well these are

547
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
organic apples

548
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,360
that's number one so i have organic

549
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,200
apples here so keep that in mind

550
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,159
um yeah if you get in conventional apple

551
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,039
and it was sprayed recently before

552
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,880
harvest

553
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,960
so conventional apple if it's sprayed

554
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,520
close to harvest okay

555
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,360
if that's the case then you're going to

556
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,480
have some pesticides on that apple

557
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,360
okay and then they wax them so they put

558
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,679
the msg

559
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
wax on top of a conventional apple and

560
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,640
they coat those pesticides and almost

561
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
kind of

562
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
encapsulate them on the skin

563
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
conventional apples i

564

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:46,159
right on top just like that and what i

621
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:48,000
like to do is take a spoon

622
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,679
and i kind of like just to mix it up and

623
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
i like to use a spoon to eat it that's

624
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,520
that's the way i like to do it then you

625
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,640

626
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,039

628
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
so that's the apple

629
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
cinnamon smoothie right there that i

630
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360

632
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,080

633
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
which is this book right here

634
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,120

635
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,679
we're doing the medical meeting morning

636
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,919
cleanse and this is an incredible

637
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,279
incredible meal right there so i want to

638
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,840
cover a couple little things with you

639
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,279
guys

640
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,279
just moving stuff out of the way here

641
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,960
[Music]

642
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,720
you can do lime instead of lemon water

643
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,039
just another option you can do lime

644
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,799
because that people ask about that all

645
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,720
the time and i got limes right here but

646
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,640
you can do limes that's perfectly fine

647
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
so that's an option in your lemon water

648
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
but lemon is

649
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,480
is usually best a lot of time

650
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,600
limes are really dry so that happens

651
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,600
i'm going to move this out of the way

652
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
okay now what i have going on here this

653
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
is the millet

654
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:27,600
i have cooking right here

655
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,039
what if you can't eat banana what's a

656
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
good substitute

657
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,520
papaya is a great one that's an option

658
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,840
right there mango's a great option too

659
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,360
so those are those are those are awesome

660
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so you can do that

661
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,840
if you need to

662
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,360

663
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440

664
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320

675
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
its own

676
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
all it says it's an incredible smoothie

677
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,720
have you had it before

678
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,440
amazing so here's what you want to do

679
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,080
with your

680
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
medical medium morning cleanse you want

681
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
to keep the fats

682
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
out of your morning the key is

683
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,039
protecting your liver

684
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
the key is getting your liver better the

685
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,080
key is about getting the toxins out of

686
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,279
your liver and you might be like

687
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
well do i have a liver issue well do i

688
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,919
really have one

689
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,679
if you have any unwanted weight like if

690
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,679
you're gaining weight ever in your life

691
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,240
that means your liver is maxed out

692
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,919
and that means the liver is all it's all

693
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,520
filled up with fat to begin with

694
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,120
so that's the start of the problem right

695
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,320
there so if you have any kind of weight

696
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,159
issues on any level

697
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,760
if you're gaining weight on any level

698
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,840
the liver is maxed out

699
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,679
it's got too much fat inside the liver

700
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
so that's number one that's one problem

701
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
all on its own that that people have

702
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,000
if you have skin issues like vitiligo

703
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,919
eczema psoriasis rosacea

704
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,760
dermatitis dandruff

705
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,120
that's all a liver issue so that's a

706
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,600
liver problem right there

707
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
if you have heart palpitations if you're

708
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,399
dealing with migraines

709
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
if you're dealing with any kind of

710
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,520
autoimmune the liver is involved

711
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,559
too so crohn's colitis

712
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,120
acid reflux celiac ibs

713
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,120
the liver is involved that's a big part

714
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,880
of why there's a problem so

715
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
all this is important to know so what

716
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
you're doing with the medical media

717
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,679
morning cleanse is you're restoring your

718
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,679

720
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,600
liver to where it needs to be

721
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,120
you're giving it a chance to heal and

722
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,159

723
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,960
your liver wants a routine that's what

724
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360

725
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
it wants to do a routine every single

726
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,559
day and we break that routine by

727
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,840

728
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,480
up bringing in eggs
