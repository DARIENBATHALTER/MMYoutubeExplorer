me that it means everything to know that

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,079

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,640

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,400
heard in any circuit in any Alternative

183
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,080
Market or any inter alternative healing

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
or in any books or on the Internet

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,360
information that Spirit provides that's

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
never been heard before so you can heal

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,479
I can't get lazy on that I just have to

188
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,879
listen to Spirit and get you that

189
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,520
information and deliver that just like

190
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,199
when I delivered it as a child to so

191
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,400
many people andto my grandmother and to

192
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,520
everybody else and I delivered that

193
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,520
information growing up and then being

194
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,720
there for you guys so anyway we're doing

195
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,159
cold and

196
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,879
flu cold and flu that's what we're doing

197
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:03,240
today so germs germs and germs how do we

198
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,440
first of of all not catch the flu how do

199
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,759
we not catch it there's ways of

200
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,319
protecting ourselves I think I told you

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,319
this one story before where I was you

202
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,360
know I was

203
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,280
traveling and I was rundown and I was

204
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,720
traveling and uh I I think it's about

205
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,199
five or six years ago don't know what it

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,520
is now I can't remember now but you know

207
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,879
and and a lot was going on and there was

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,280
a flu ripping through everybody had it

209
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,159
they all had the sinuses the cough they

210
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,360
all had the fevers everybody was getting

211
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:41,519
it had it and I remember I felt a little

212
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,800
tickle in my throat and I said oh man

213
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,920
this is this is just not this is not

214
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,800
good I don't need this right now I'm

215
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
doing so much somebody must have coughed

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,880
in my

217
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,680
face someone someone must have you know

218
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,200
or whatever and I felt that tickle in my

219
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,519
throat and spirit said the zinc the Li

220
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,880
liquid zinc sulfate the liquid zinc

221
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,760
sulfate and I did zinc shock therapy

222
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
that's what I did well hey it sounds

223
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,279
like it's something out there no no it's

224
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,160
something that I created meaning through

225
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,600
spirit that Spirit helped me create it's

226
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,480
not something you look up and you look

227
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,399
up Zing shock therapy and if it is out

228
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,320
there now that's because of me for sure

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,640
okay but the point is is because it

230
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,279
sounds like something that's already

231
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,519
been going around and it's out it's out

232
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,560
it's been out forever no it's not and

233
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,959
what happened is spirit said zinc zinc

234
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,079
shock therapy

235
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,399
I said okay what do I do Spirit what do

236
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:37,440
I do and I just shot a whole bunch of

237
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,680
dropper FS right in the throat

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,040
immediately cuz I knew I knew I was

239
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,720
coming down with that

240
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,240
flu and I just boom boom and I wasn't

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,360
sleeping cuz I was traveling a lot I

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,800
wasn't sleeping I was catching an hour

243
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,079
here catching an hour there was so much

244
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,279
going on it was the height of the flu

245
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,920
season and I just squirted it on down

246
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,560
there one squirt two squirt three squirt

247
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,000
four squirt right in the throat let it

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,040
sit there 2 hours later 1 2 3 4 squirts

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,279
let it sit in there couple hours later 1

250
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,640
2 3 4 let it sit in there bam woke up

251
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:13,120
that morning the next morning gone gone

252
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,360
gone gone never even touched me I got it

253
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,600
early I got it early and if we can't get

254
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,959
it early we can't get it early that's

255
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,279
okay too we could do lots and lots of

256
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,440
things to protect ourselves from the flu

257
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,800
and we're going to cover all kinds of

258
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,040
information about the flu and everything

259
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:33,040
so you know today's going to be really

260
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,800
fun but so the deal is the deal is how

261
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
do we not catch it to begin with well

262
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,120
you know we got to try not to get rund

263
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,639
down we got to try to get some sleep

264
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:46,000
okay fine you know those are the

265
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:49,120
basics but the flu virus likes to eat it

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,440
likes to eat like other viruses viruses

267
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,279
love to eat now um you know there there

268
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,279
are people out there professionals out

269
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,600
there in the medical world that don't

270
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,560
know yet

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,399
that viruses feed that they consume they

272
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,560
believe that no these cells reproduce

273
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,079
they reproduce through a protein and and

274
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,760
um that's all they do they don't they

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,839
don't eat anything and so this is this

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,200
is information that's out there as far

277
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,480
as viruses don't eat anything that's

278
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,240
wrong and

279
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,240
misinformation viruses feed they eat

280
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,079
that's what they do they love certain

281
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,760
things like for instance I always talk

282
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,079
about the epscene bar virus I'm the

283
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,160
first one to bring into the world what

284
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,399
Epstein bar what symptoms Epstein bar

285
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,120
causes I'm the first person to do that

286
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,079
now it's being taken and the

287
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,079
information's just being scrambled it's

288
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,720
running around a muck out there uh

289
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,160
people aren't giving me credit about it

290
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,000
and they're just trying to rewrite it

291
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,880
and it's but it's not you know 100%

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,480
accurate and I always say try to go to

293
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,360
the main source the main source is

294
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Spirit that's the main source so when it

295
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,440
comes down EP bar and stuff always come

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,360
back to Spirits information um the

297
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,760
thyroid book covers a lot of that that

298
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,279
I've never even covered in the first

299
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,920
book medical medium but anyway

300
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:09,000
viruses viruses feed and they're

301
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,399
hungry they multiply through food

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,079
sources that's what they do food can

303
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:20,399
enter into a virus so viruses have a

304
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,360
door a doorway that opens and shuts and

305
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,399
food enters into the virus that's how it

306
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,440
grows and

307
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,199
reproduces this is will be discovered it

308
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,240
will be and there's lots of things that

309
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,360
are discovered now that I knew 30 years

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,880
ago this one will be eventually but the

311
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,959
flu virus loves food now if you talk

312
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,560
about the Aven flu if you talk about the

313
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,920
bird flu bird flu the reason why the

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,320
birds catch a flu is the virus loves to

315
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,040
attack it has the ability to attack a

316
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,240
bird it has the ability to feed off of a

317
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,160
bird what's the bird of choice that flu

318
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,440
viruses love to feed off of the bird

319
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:04,000
choice is chicken chicken chickens okay

320
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:08,720
fowl chicken that's what bird flu likes

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,800
to actually eat and feed off of and bird

322
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,480
flu is a dangerous one because it causes

323
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,720
flesh deterioration because it feeds off

324
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,800
of Flesh internally inside the bird so

325
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,760
that flu bug feeds off the adrenal

326
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,600
glands inside of a bird meaning it eats

327
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,800
adrenal gland and it eats eats flesh so

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,880
it actually feeds off of um cells cells

329
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,680
in the body flesh cells in the body of a

330
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,199
bird so that's the kind of virus it is

331
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,519
but all flu viruses like to eat chicken

332
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,440
now I'm not trying to scare the crap out

333
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,800
of everybody purposely to get them to

334
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,920
stop eating chicken you like chicken and

335
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,440
that's what does you right you feel and

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,000
you're eating still your leafy greens

337
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,519
and you're still bringing some fruits in

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
that I want you to bring then hey if

339
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,920
that's what you want to do that's what

340
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,240
you want to do you know I I'm not anti

341
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,839
every single diet but I will say if you

342
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,880
want the least chance of catching a flu

343
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,000
or stomach flu especially that darn

344
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,920
stomach flu where you vomit and you're

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,440
sick and your stomach's a hot mess if

346
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,399
you want to get rid of all the you know

347
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,040
the different stomach flu then you don't

348
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,639
want to have chicken in your system and

349
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,519
I don't mean chicken that day or chicken

350
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,639
that night I mean Chicken in general now

351
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,120
what what you're thinking right now

352
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,519
maybe not all of you but what you're

353
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,880
probably thinking is hey wait a minute

354
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,959
what about chicken soup isn't that the

355
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,000
best cure for the flu no it's not the

356
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,440
best cure for the flu it's not it never

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
was a cure for the flu now I know I'm

358
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,079
controversial on this for a minute here

359
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
because I know there's a whole bunch of

360
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,680
chicken soup stuff going on out there

361
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
and there's all these people trying to

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,639
prove it and it's always it's been you

363
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
know it's been looked at and it's

364
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,560
folklore and it goes it's everything

365
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,320
from science to folkl or whatever but no

366
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,240
chicken soup is not what makes somebody

367
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,519
start getting better or feeling a little

368
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,720
better okay it's the it's whatever else

369
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,240
is in that chicken soup it's the garlic

370
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,839
it's the onions everybody does a chicken

371
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,759
soup differently they have the garlic in

372
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,839
there they have the onions in there they

373
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,519
have the carrots in there they have the

374
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,959
celery in there they have they have um

375
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,319
I've seen people put zucchini in their

376
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,000
chicken soup

377
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,440
you know old recipes just just chopping

378
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,680
up zucchini it goes in there I've seen

379
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,759
lots of different things in chicken

380
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,000
soups every Grandma has a different

381
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,319
chicken soup they're not all the same

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,440
but it's what's in that chicken soup

383
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:48,120
namely garlic namely an onion especially

384
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,959
an onion believe it or not that actually

385
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,720
helps improve and then it's the

386
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,720
hydration of the chicken soup and it's

387
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,839
the mineral salts in the chicken soup

388
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,160
the mineral salt there's nothing in the

389
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,399
chicken that help helps you with a

390
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,160
colder flu that's the part that's

391
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,319
fighting against you when you're using

392
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,519
chicken soup for a flu or a cold I'm not

393
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,720
trying to be negative about chicken soup

394
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,000
not I'm just trying to look if I don't

395
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,000
give it to you straight then I'm doing

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,079
you wrong bottom line I'm doing you're

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,639
wrong so if you're if you get upset

398
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,120
about me and you think I'm like might be

399
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,639
biased about chicken soup or anything

400
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,880
like that because people are really

401
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,839
their head strong about their chicken

402
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,839
soup like that's one area I was afraid

403
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,560
of even kind of jumping into today I

404
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,040
remember for the show I I Was preparing

405
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,480
a little bit I was talking to my

406
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,120
assistant and I said I'm afraid to talk

407
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,519
about the chicken soup I'm

408
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,079
afraid I'm afraid but then you know I

409
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,399
thought about it and then spirit said to

410
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,360
me spirit said what are you going to do

411
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,639
you going to do the people wrong I said

412
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,880
what do you mean spirit said well you

413
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,519
just don't be straight with them you're

414
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,319
going to do them wrong I go oh man so

415
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,959
here's the deal here's the deal what

416
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,480
happens is with that chicken soup you

417
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,120
got all the mineral salts in there from

418
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,279
the celery you got that you got the

419
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,720
carrots there's mineral salts and

420
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,079
carrots and there's also precious sugars

421
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,679
that feed your liver and feed your body

422
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,720
and feed your body's immune system to

423
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,360
fight the flu and then the onion the

424
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,199
onion is antiviral

425
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,799
antiviral garlic antiviral the flu is a

426
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,880
virus that's what makes chicken soup

427
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,039
chicken soup so what I like is I like

428
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,480
taking out the chicken because that

429
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,520
feeds the virus that feeds the flu virus

430
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
especially the flu virus out of all the

431
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,480
viruses especially the flu virus the

432
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,559
chicken is literally its number one food

433
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,320
number one food and people who eat

434
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,760
chicken on a daily basis every day when

435
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,559
the flu season comes around they get the

436
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,320
flu and they may get it twice three

437
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
times unless they take care of

438
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,960
themselves in other ways while they're

439
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,200
still eating the chicken unless they're

440
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,880
taking care of themselves so the person

441
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,000
who goes I never caught a flu and I eat

442
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,120
chicken every day it's cuz you're

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,440
probably doing other things for your

444
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,799
health and you're keeping yourself

445
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,480
steady with all these different ways so

446
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,080
when you do catch that colder flu it's

447
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,440
mild or you don't remember you had one

448
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,400
cuz it was 2 years ago and it was mild

449
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,200
mild there's a lot of people that got

450
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,200
get

451
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
slammed three four times a year with a

452
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,640
cold or flu or sinus infection or

453
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,960
stomach

454
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,559
flu and you want that chicken out of

455
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,159
there just telling you right now you

456
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
want it out of there you want the

457
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,480
healing broths I like the healing broth

458
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
reason why the healing broth doesn't

459
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
have chicken in it because I don't want

460
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,440
it to be a chicken soup because I know

461
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,840
that viruses will the viruses that are

462
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,640
chicken wanting will want it chicken

463
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,600
hungry will want it so so that's why the

464
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,200
healing broth is what it is because it

465
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,159
really is a healing broth when you

466
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,360
remove the viral

467
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,679
feeder really important to know so you

468
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,520
can still make your your still make your

469
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,760
chicken soup without the chicken and

470
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,840
still get better results with cold flu

471
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,919
you know sinus infections a whole bit in

472
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,400
fact why don't you put more onion in it

473
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:55,400
in fact why don't you put more garlic in

474
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,000
it and make it a real healing healing

475
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:03,120
soup a a savior a graceful savior soup

476
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,240
why don't you really do that and remove

477
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
that chicken fat chicken fat takes

478
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,280
oxygen out of the blood so you can't

479
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
fight the virus even faster so it even

480
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,440
the fat from the chicken on top of that

481
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,600
chicken sou make a big big pot of

482
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,400
chicken soup stick it in the

483
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,159
refrigerator and the next morning you

484
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,000
come to it and you got a half inch of

485
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:28,640
fat on top of that Frozen not frozen but

486
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,039
solidified gated right there on top

487
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,280
right there on top that fat right there

488
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,799
slows down your liver makes it sluggish

489
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,679
that fat right there stops your immune

490
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,960
system from beating down epine bar it

491
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,520
stops your immune system from beating

492
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,120
down a flu virus right there stops your

493
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,039
immune system from from beating down

494
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,120
bacteria like strep aaka strep Ackle to

495
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,080
strep throat it stops that a big fat

496
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,880
layer of fat stops oxygen to your immune

497
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,440
system oxygen to your liver oxygen to

498
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,520
your heart you don't want that on your

499
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,080

weeks after that it's 6 weeks after that

542
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,760
then you get into then you get into

543
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,240
March it's six weeks after that then you

544
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,200
get your next wave of flu April six

545
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,360
weeks after that you get your next wave

546
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,919
of flu in May and just when you think no

547
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,279
one catches colds and flu in the

548
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,919
summertime bull they all catch colds and

549
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,440
flu in the summertime been helping

550
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,039
people for over 30 years I can't tell

551
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,600
you how many people both kids and adults

552
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,919
sinus infections all summer long from

553
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,279
getting the flu getting the sinus flu

554
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,640
stomach flu during the summer barfing

555
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,559
their brains out stomach flu viral flu

556
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,279
um chest flues bronchitis in the middle

557
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,960
of the summer going all the way to

558
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,799
August there's always an August flu

559
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,840
before you even get to late September

560
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,240
when everybody goes back to

561
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,200
school the flu never stops because it's

562
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,520
happening all across the country all

563
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,320
across the globe

564
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,799
when it's winter in Australia the flu's

565
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,720
ramp it you see and it's everybody's

566
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,440
hopping on planes and bringing it to the

567
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,320
US it doesn't matter where it is and in

568
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,679
the summertime in summertime in

569
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,799
Australia I'm just using Australia's

570
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,039
example everybody's bringing it over

571
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:54,279
there in the planes from our winter it

572
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:57,120
doesn't matter the flu is 247 it's all

573
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,440
year long everybody's catching it

574
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,440
different times of the season it doesn't

575
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,799
matter and it's always there and colds

576
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,880
have died they have been taking over see

577
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,360
cold bugs the little cold bugs that used

578
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,640
to be the bugs of the colds little tiny

579
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,960
sore throat some sniffles goes away in a

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,120
day um if you're lucky a temperature of

581
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,760
99 those are the past now if you do have

582
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,400
symptoms like that you could easily have

583
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,000
one of the mild flu or your body's

584
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,840
fighting that flu fantastically so it

585
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,720
doesn't turn into what feels like a flu

586
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,080
so you feel like you just had a cold so

587
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,159
if you're at work and someone's like oh

588
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,000
I just dealing with a cold I got sinuses

589
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,080
got a little thing no it's the flu it's

590
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
the flu bottom line and how you may

591
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,559
react to that flu is different than how

592
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
the other person reacts too everybody

593
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,080
reacts differently some people get a

594
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,360
pipe and fever of 104 pipe and fever of

595
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,120
102 they're

596
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,039
Delirious some people they just just run

597
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,720
a temperature of 100 they go to

598
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:02,080
work they go out and Bowl after work

599
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,240
and um and that's what happens and you

600
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,240
know it's it's it's it's not so not so

601
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,000
heavy duty it's kind of mild here's the

602
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,679
deal the flu always creates all this

603
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,400
mucus in many cases and what happens is

604
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:21,000
when it creates mucus like that so when

605
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,000
the mucus starts and starts to drain it

606
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,880
drains at night it drains you know the

607
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,039
whole postnasal trip but even more than

608
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,600
that drains into the chest you may not

609
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,600
feel it you may not have a cough at

610
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,159
first when you start with a flu and you

611
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,120
different levels of flues different mild

612
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,240
ones whatever but whether mild to

613
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,080
extreme and then the mucus builds up in

614
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,919
the lungs 3 days later you start to

615
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,200
cough or the mucus starts breaking up or

616
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,559
really starts in the sinus is heavier

617
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,039
and heavier then drains back down in the

618
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,960
chest that mucus in the chest that's

619
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,880
where bronchitis that's what bronchitis

620
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,520
is bronchitis is that mucus down in the

621
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,039
chest

622
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:04,159
pneumonia is is when bacteria starts to

623
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,200
proliferate starts to grow from that

624
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,399
mucus being down there too long so you

625
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
get you become

626
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,320
pneumatic so you know because people

627
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,520
have the pneumonia bacteria they have it

628
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,120
they both have different varieties of

629
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,440
pneumonia bacteria all in them they have

630
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,640
chamian pneumonia they have all

631
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,360
different kinds of pneumonia that's

632
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,760
inside of them so you have to you have

633
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,919
to understand how that works um so

634
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,200
that's in US automatically that bacteria

635
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,679
and that bacteria really is worthless it

636
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,760
doesn't cause any trouble unless you're

637
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,399
really beaten down run down eating

638
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,880
terribly wrong um catching cold and flu

639
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:43,120
and not even catching cold and flu if

640
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,360
you're just beaten down and run down not

641
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,640
taking care of yourself and you're

642
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,919
severely zinc deficient yeah you know

643
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,080
you can you can get that bacteria can

644
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,520
really you know start up you can get a

645
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,320
strep strep strep bacteria in the lungs

646
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,440
causing uh pneumonia too a strep

647
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,360
pneumonia IA you can get you know a

648
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,120
Pneumatic bacteria basically what that

649
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,559
means it's a bacteria that that's kind

650
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,200
of slightly unidentified to some degree

651
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,799
it's just they that's what they call it

652
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,559
pneumonia basically they don't know what

653
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,200
it is there's a couple of varieties of

654
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,559
pneumatic

655
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,480
bacteria and um you know really believe

656
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,200
it or not the strep has a lot to do with

657
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,760
a different varieties causing causing

658
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,360
that but the whole point is you got the

659
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,520
flu it's draining

660
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,840
down and it gets down to the

661
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,200
lung and then it sits in there the mucus

662
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,640
and then you got the cough and you got

663
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,520
the bronchitis so if you're not you know

664
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,960
doing expectance and taking care of

665
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,880
yourself and taking it easy you know

666
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
that that mucus you get the coughing

667
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
attacks in the morning coughing teexs at

668
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,200
night and you really can't you can't

669
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,000
function good and then what happens is

670
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,640
if the mucus is down there way too long

671
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,399
you can get the pneumonia possibilities

672
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,039
which is bacteria can get built up down

673
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,559
here whether it's a strep that you've

674
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:03,919
had in your system for years or um you

675
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,720
know a type of pneumatic bacteria that

676
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,320
you've happened to have in your system

677
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,039
like a caldia bacteria anything like

678
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,320
that yeah and and it could be down in

679
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,039
there and start creating some kind of

680
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,120
pneumonia if you're really run down if

681
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,720
your zinc reserves are low you're not

682
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,960
taking care of yourself it can go into

683
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,279
something like that but the mucus a lot

684
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,919
of people when they first come down with

685
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,200
their flu they're usually say they go to

686
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,000
work and they're not feeling that great

687
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,600
they get the sore throat and they're

688
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,960
like no no I just got a sore throat

689
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
everything's all good but then you know

690
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,919
that night comes sore throat gets a

691
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,360
little worse they get a fever in the

692
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,519
morning like okay they go back to work

693
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,159
again and now you know the the the

694
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,240
sinuses start to clog up and the mucus

695
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,440
starts to form a little later on it's

696
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,840
almost predictable you said well you're

697
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,720
going to have a cough in four days

698
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,840
you're going to have a cough in 3 days

699
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
you're going to have a cough in 5 days

700
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,559
they're like no no no no I'm not going

701
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,000
to have a cough how could I have a cough

702
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,000
I only have a sore throat I got a little

703
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,960
mild fever no you're going to have a

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,519
cough and then yeah four or 5 days later

705
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,960
person's coughing their brains out

706
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,679
because you know the flu is just running

707
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,440
the course but here's how it works it's

708
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,120
like an every six week cycle I was

709
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,480
talking about before there's a new flu

710
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,720
in the Horizon new flu in the Horizon

711
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,200
I've seen people catch him every 3

712
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,159
months I've seen people catch him every

713
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,840
six weeks I've seen people run down

714
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,360
where they catch them in all different

715
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,480
ways but there's a lot of different flu

716
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,760
they take different shapes different

717
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,640
sizes flues come in different varieties

718
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,720
some flu like to create more high fevers

719
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,480
some like to be sinus related only only

720
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,679
and some like to be stomach related some

721
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,159
like to be across between sinus and

722
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,480
stomach a lot of people get so much

723
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,159
mucus that they think they got a stomach

724
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,159
flu but it was really just all sinus

725
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,200
because the amount of mucus that they

726
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,760
swallowed lots of swallowing mucus down

727
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,279
in in the stomach letting it sit down in

728
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,880
there and then the stomach gets sick it

729
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,279
gets bloated as heck and no appetite

730
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,919
sometimes you might vomit mucus there's

731
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,080
a lot of people that cough and vomit

732
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,799
mucus when they got the flu because

733
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,600
their stomachs are filled with mucus

734
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,039
their lungs have it and they're just

735
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,720
coughing it out so these are all the

736
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,399
things hey maybe you you've been in this

737
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:28,039
position maybe you know someone but um

738
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,120
so knocking colds and flu out early is a

739
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,799
big deal so we're going to cover that I

740
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,960
talked about the zinc always have a

741
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,399
bottle of liquid sulfate zinc with you

742
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,159
nearby in your life just always have it

743
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,240
because if you think you're even

744
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,840
remotely getting the possibility of a of

745
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,960
a flu you want to shoot that zinc in

746
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,799
your throat and let it sit there if

747
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,600
you're zinc sensitive where you're just

748
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,480
too

749
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
sensitive just do a few tiny drops some

750
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
people that can't they're really

751
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,159
sensitive to certain vitamins and zinc

752
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,600
can be you know a sensitive thing to

753
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,720
some people um how do how else do we

754
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,640
prevent a flu keep your fingers and your

755
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,919
face keep your fingers in your hands

756
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,559
away from your face keep your fingers

757
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,159
and your hands away from your eyes you

758
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,919
know if it's flu season you're working

759
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,399
on keyboards and you're working and

760
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,799
you're doing this and wherever you are

761
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,960
or you're touching somebody that's got

762
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,720
the flu whatever you got to do just

763
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,840
don't take your hands and put your

764
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,000
fingers in your eyes don't rub your eyes

765
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,200
because it's an instant flu it's a

766
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,640
guaranteed catch I mean practically

767
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,799
guaranteed when you're out and about

768
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,720
going to restaurants whatever you know

769
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,679
take handy wipes with you during flu

770
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,080
season use a handy wipe before you start

771
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,919
your dinner at a

772
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,799
restaurant order your food hot order

773
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,679
your food hot at the restaurants so that

774
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,200
the person making it because during flu

775
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,080
season they're coughing they're sneezing

776
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,200
coughing all over your food sneezing all

777
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,120
over your food the weight is sneezing on

778
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,600
your food coughing on your

779
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,919
food and it goes on and on and on the

780
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,799
beat goes on and and you want to make

781
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,200
sure your food comes really hot so it

782
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,279
just basically kills the flu viruses

783
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,399
these little things matter every bit of

784
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,960
it so you want you know want to make

785
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,760
sure you got cooked food and you don't

786
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
want to be doing the raw salads and and

787
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,279
when you're in the middle of flu season

788
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,600
in restaurants and you want to make sure

789
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,760
that your food is piping hot you know

790
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,440
say hey look can you can you make the

791
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,159
plate hot can you make the food you know

792
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,679
can you just throw the food in the oven

793
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,559
get it nice and hot whatever it is it

794
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,120
all matters so see these are some of the

795
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:42,440
things to think about so let's go back

796
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:46,399
to um what foods feed the

797
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:51,720
flu what foods feed all viruses dairy

798
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,679
products that's a big feeder of viruses

799
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,120
I talk about it in the books you know

800
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,799
and I talk about it in different ways

801
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,880
like the first book I mentioned it

802
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,440
Medical medium and then I provided more

803
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,559
information in the second book but it's

804
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,840
important to know that what you're

805
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,639
eating can feed something else that's a

806
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,840
way that's a real true way of protecting

807
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,600
yourself right there it's it's really

808
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,559
imperative to know that and you might

809
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,559
say well I mean I feel fine once I've

810
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,559
eaten that piece of cheese I feel okay I

811
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,200
can eat cheese you know every day I

812
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,080
could have it on my salads I could have

813
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,039
it on my sandwiches but it is a recipe

814
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,120
for feeding something eventually whether

815
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,799
it's an Epstein bar whether it's cytoma

816
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,600
virus whether it's hhv6 whether it's

817
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:42,360
simplex one Simplex 2 whether it's you

818
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,279
know um something else it can feed it

819
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,360
including bacteria it can feed it eoli

820
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,240
loves eoli itself loves it merca loves

821
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,120
it loves dairy products just so many

822
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,080
things love it and if you're big into

823
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,760
parasites if you're someone who just you

824
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,679
know is is a parasite freak meaning like

825
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,200
you know you know there's people out

826
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
there that just everything's parasites

827
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,639
everything's parasites everything's

828
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,039
parasites it it then don't feed the

829
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:10,279
parasites cuz guess what parasites eat

830
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,559
they eat and worms eat dairy products

831
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,200
that's what they love milk cheese butter

832
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,360
milk cheese butter kefir yogurt ghee

833
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,320
yeah even ghee believe it or not so

834
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,000
always know this so cold flu season

835
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,760
don't eat any dairy products you have a

836
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,600
better chance of not catching cold not

837
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,279
catching a flu and if you catch the

838
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,360
flu okay it could be much more mild less

839
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,399
mucus I've seen people who catch the flu

840
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,840
every single year I mean out of the

841
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,200
Decades I've been helping people they

842
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,200
catch the flu every year couple of times

843
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,039
a year worst flues ever mucus everything

844
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,000
bronchitis you name it sinus infections

845
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,120
all of it with it misery and they

846
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,840
stopped dairy products and they stopped

847
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,720
getting the flu or the flu was cut down

848
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,559
to a manageable level where they caught

849
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,679
it once it was mild and they moved on

850
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,120
with their

851
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,880
life okay another one too eggs big one

852
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,839
really does feed the flu virus so cold

853
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,079
season you don't want to make two

854
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,599
scrambled eggs if you do make two

855
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,159
scrambled eggs for breakfast during cold

856
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,359
and flu season or whatever during that

857
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,359
time and I still say cold even though

858
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:22,760
they don't exist anymore it's all flu

859
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,679
but it's by habit just so many years but

860
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,359
the bottom line is you put put some

861
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,200
garlic on that toast then if you're

862
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,000
going to have egg and toast put some

863
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,119
garlic on it if you're going to have

864
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,159
butter you I mean I know you know people

865
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,839
like yeah but grass-fed butter is the

866
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,359
best and that's no yeah that's better

867
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,359
absolutely that's better because it's

868
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,359
going to lack it's going to lack all

869
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:46,240
that you know that GMO grain inside of

870
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,720
it it's going to lack you know all of

871
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,240
that um hormone and everything that's

872
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,879
added it's going to lack it's going to

873
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,960
be reduced in heavy metals I get it so

874
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,280
sure you have the grass-fed butter it's

875
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,480
still going to feed a flu so if you're

876
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,760
having a flu cold and you make some

877
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,560
scrambled eggs and you have some toast

878
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,880
with some butter put some garlic in

879
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,079
there you got to try to help defend also

880
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,200
put something in there that's going to

881
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,440
be killing off the flu

882
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,240
virus at the same time you're trying to

883
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,880
feed the flu virus by

884
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,920
accident so you know and that's that's

885
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,320
an option you can do you know and I

886
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,000
offer that option because some people

887
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,599
they just like they like their toast and

888
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,920
butter they they love it

889
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,160
and they catch a cold and flu and they

890
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,720
have tea and they have toast and butter

891
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,079
so we put some garlic in there're like

892
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,160
yuck no try it they put a little garlic

893
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,359
raw garlic on top of there and they have

894
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,720
it they actually get better and they get

895
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,599
better faster they feel a little bit

896
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,440
better and they notice a difference so

897
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,400
it's something you can do so stay away

898
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,200
from the eggs stay away from the dairy

899
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,240
products when it comes down to those flu

900
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,480
and being sick sinus infections sore

rose hips in bulk you can get them in

1154
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,680
tea bags too now but I like getting them

1155
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,720
in bulk taking those rose hips really

1156
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,359

1160
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,079
of lemon in there and that right there

1161
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,559
is a

1162
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:20,160
powerhouse it's incredible for for sore

1163
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,720
throats okay now there's what happens

1164
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,280
with sore throats there's a lot of

1165
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:27,240
things that cause different sore throats

1166
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,800
that aren't flu Rel needed but their

1167
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,040
strep their lowgrade chronic strep now

1168
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,720
just because someone has a sore throat

1169
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,359
and a doctor they go see the doctor and

1170
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,880
the doctor does a swab on the back of

1171
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,880
the throat does a culture and strep

1172
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,400
doesn't show up doesn't mean it's not

1173
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,720
strep related the only time the strep

1174
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,480
shows up from a culture is when it's at

1175
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,319
its earlier times when someone has strep

1176
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,000
throat it's like when when uh children

1177
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:57,760
or young adults have a really bad case a

1178
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,359
white pocket bubbles up on the tonsil or

1179
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,040
the back of the throat to the sides of

1180
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,720
the tonsils and that's swabble that's

1181
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,280
swabble you could run a culture on that

1182
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,880
but after that a lot of times people can

1183
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,640
get sore throats and it not be you can't

1184
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,359
do that you stick the swab down there

1185
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,960
the the strep is in the lymphatic system

1186
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:21,319
chronically underlying inside the

1187
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,839
lymphatic system and it's causing sore

1188
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:26,240
throats so that's something to

1189
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:30,839
understand too strep is just that's how

1190
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,040
works okay you can also have an Epstein

1191
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:37,880
bar sore throat you can have a mono sore

1192
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,839
throat a mono sore throat um that is a

1193
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,359
virus meaning it's a mono virus abine

1194
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:44,160
bar virus causing a red sore throat on

1195
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,680
one side of the throat that hurts really

1196
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,000
bad I'm giving you some different stuff

1197
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,400
about sore throats that are separate

1198
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,640
from

1199
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,800
flues and so where you never develop uh

1200
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,680
you never develop sinusitis you never

1201
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,000
develop mucus you're not coughing ever

1202
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,599
ever but you get this wicked sore throat

1203
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
on the left side of your throat did

1204
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,280
anybody ever get that and the wicked

1205
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,000
sore throat on the right side of the

1206
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,319
throat or sometimes both but yet it

1207
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,240
doesn't turn into mucus it doesn't turn

1208
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,640
into a fever that's an Epstein bar

1209
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,480
related sore throat that people get all

1210
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,680
the time believe it or not when Epstein

1211
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,200
bar starts to go and surfaces up through

1212
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,160
the lymphatic system and gets to the

1213
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,520
throat when you get run down it's a

1214
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,480
different level of chronic mono people

1215
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,960
experienc in their life every now and

1216
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,040
then so that's just a tidbit too that I

1217
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,520
thought I'd cover as well um I hope this

1218
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,880
Show's been helpful I hope it has these

1219
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,359
are some of the things you can do to

1220
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,400
protect yourself um when you go on

1221
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,640
airplanes take handy wipes when you go

1222
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,319
on airplanes airplanes are Petri dishes

1223
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,079
they are Petri dishes it's like sitting

1224
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:51,680
in a Petri dish it's like basking in a

1225
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,119
Petri dish you know the funny thing is

1226
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,440
when I'm on the airplane um Spirit

1227
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,319
doesn't stop telling me what's wrong

1228
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,760
with every single person on the airplane

1229
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:03,319
so when I get on there okay when I get

1230
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,240
on there it's it's um there's it's

1231
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:07,480
really funny I got to tell you something

1232
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,160
I used to think let me be the first one

1233
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,319
on the plane to sit in the back the way

1234
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,960
back the last seat in the back I'll try

1235
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,720
to get I always think let me go sit in

1236
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
the last seat so I don't have to watch

1237
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,880
everybody walk down the aisle by me so I

1238
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,040
could do readings but what happens then

1239
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,920
is I can see everybody in front of me

1240
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,640
ahead of me when you're sitting way in

1241
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,400
the back you just see a a sea of people

1242
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,119
and and then spirit's giving me readings

1243
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,000
on every single person I'm looking at so

1244
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,440
then I thought let me sit at the front

1245
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,839
of the plane in any way I can capacity

1246
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,200
and then but then everybody walking by

1247
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,040
me as I'm sitting there you you know you

1248
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,240
get the read on so it's really funny

1249
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,599
I've tried to dodge it the best I can

1250
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,440
but what happens is spirit will be like

1251
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,319
that person's got a flu it's it's it's

1252
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,440
in the middle of the stage of the flu

1253
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:59,040
that person just is getting the flu that

1254
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,359
person's cough they're getting over the

1255
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,480
flu that person has pneumonia that

1256
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,480
person has bronchitis so every three

1257
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,079
people that person is going to get the

1258
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
flu in three days that person is going

1259
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,119
to get it a week from now so spirit's

1260
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,760
telling me this as each person's walking

1261
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,000
by down the aisle and then spirit says

1262
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:24,440
that person has

1263
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,599
tuberculosis that person has this and it

1264
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,160
goes on that person person just came

1265
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:29,880
from visiting a family member in a

1266
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,440
hospital and has

1267
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,160
Mera so this is how it works when I sit

1268
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,160
on the plane and they walk but everybody

1269
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,720
walks by so I like to bring handy

1270
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,200
wipes and if you want you can be as bold

1271
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,319
as bringing an n95 mask or some kind of

1272
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,400
mask you know little little Hospital

1273
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,760
mask but you know that's that's another

1274
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,119
option too you have to prevent catching

1275
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,640
something on planes I'm trying not to

1276
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,440
make you you know phobic about it all

1277
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm just saying in the height of the

1278
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,720
season even though the flu goes all year

1279
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,920
like I talked about before in the height

1280
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,000
of the season in the winter when you

1281
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,319
don't want to catch it because it's you

1282
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,480
know Zer degrees outside and you want to

1283
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,079
function and battle the elements you

1284
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,160
know you just got to look out if you can

1285
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,720
bring the handy wipes wipe off your seat

1286
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,520
in the side of your seat or something

1287
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,160
that the arm rests and uh Keep Your

00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,440
Hands Clean don't put your fingers in

1289
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,760
your eyes you know when I sit on a plane

1290
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,160
I watch people rubbing their eyes they

1291
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,720
take off their glasses and they just

1292
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,599
rubbing their eyes then they go to use

1293
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,520
the bathroom they grab the bathroom

1294
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,880
handle and they go in there and watch

1295
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,400
them grab the bathroom handle and go in

1296
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,000
and they use the bathroom don't wash

1297
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,359
