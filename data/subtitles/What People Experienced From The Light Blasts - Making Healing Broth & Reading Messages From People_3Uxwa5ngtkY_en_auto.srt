powerful my hands were so heavy felt

129
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,199
moving in my spine and tugging on the

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,880
right side of my head the light blasts

131
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,400
are really profound and they're very

132
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,960
potent and the thing is when they come

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,960
down on the top of the crown of the head

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,840
and they rush through the body and

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,080
they're hitting all kinds of organs and

136
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,759
cells and they're hitting even the soul

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,360
because our soul is here so they're

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,840

of the light blast like Spirit of

302
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,000

307
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:52,120

308
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,279
everybody lifechanging light from above

309
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,839
and if you don't know what the light

310
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
blast is you have no idea you just got

311
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,480
on here and like what is he even talking

312
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,880
about since I was a child Spirit of

313
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,560
compassion started talking to me at age

314
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,880
4 and in that process as I was getting a

315
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,800
you know a little older and I was 5

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,720
years old four and a half 5 years old

317
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,199
Spirit was telling me about this light

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,440
and so I found a baby bird and I would

319
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,040
have Spirit of compassion send light

320
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,959
down onto that baby bird and then I

321
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,880
would find an injured Grasshopper And I

322
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,040
would have Spirit of comp that a car

323
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,560
like bumped into or or ran into or

324
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,120
something when it was hopping I remember

325
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,240
and I um and I saw it kind of like

326
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,160
bopping around on the sidewalk all kind

327
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,440
of injured and I would grab this

328
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,120
grasshopper and then Spirit of

329
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,720
compassion I would say send down the

330
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,199
light Spirit of compassion told me about

331
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,880
this light that Spirit of compassion can

332
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,839
send down so I would hold the

333
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,560
grasshopper in my hand and I would have

334
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,320
Spirit send down the light into the

335
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,040
grasshopper right into my hand and then

336
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Spirit of compassion talked about about

337
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,959
also if Spirit of compass sends the

338
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,839
light into me and then out of my arms

339
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,680
out of my hands so that was another

340
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
thing so there's two kind of light blast

341
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
that I haven't talked about probably too

342
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,160
much is one is the light blast where

343
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
Spirit sends it directly on the crown of

344
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,959
somebody's head and it goes right

345
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,320
through their body right that's one

346
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,839
variety of light blast the other variety

347
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,199
of light blast is going into me and then

348
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,639
out my hands which is more intense for

349
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,519
me and the other one's intense too but

350
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,399
it's it's really intense when it hits me

351
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,079
all the time and I used to do that I

352
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,759
used to do that one on-one with people

353
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
back you know in my office throughout

354
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,360
the years when I used to help people

355
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,560
one-on-one before Spirit of compassion

356
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,800
said and everybody begged me to write

357
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,079
the Books and get that information

358
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,600
worldwide and so what would happen is

359
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,560
the light would go through me and out my

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,560
hands so I would use it that way and and

361
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,199
as a child I would do that with a

362
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,480
grasshopper in my hand I would do that

363
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
with an injured frog and I came across

364
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,920
an injured frog and I would hold the

365
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,639
Frog and have Spirit of compassion send

366
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,480
the light down uh on top of the frog is

367
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,320
what I would do and you know every every

368
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,160
single living you know creature that was

369
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,759
injured that I can find I would send

370
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,360
light down even if I wasn't able to now

371
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,399
hold the creature in my hand remember

372
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,800
there was an injured bunny that was

373
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,519
running around and I couldn't catch it

374
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,560
and I was a child and I couldn't catch

375
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,040
the injured bunny um still too fast but

376
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,040
yet one leg was injured and I would ask

377
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,120
Spirit of compassion to send the light

378
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,880
down and I would do the light blast as a

379
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,720
child so I would yell light light light

380
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,279
light and spirit of compassion would

381
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,720
tell me when the light was coming for

382
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,399
the injured Bunny with the injured leg

383
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,839
so the injured bunny was in a bush and

384
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,680
ran away and was in the bush but injured

385
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,680
and so I stood there and I said okay

386
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,399
let's do this and spirit of compassion

387
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,279
said okay on the count of three I'm

388
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,880
going to send the light down on that

389
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,120
Bunny and you say light you say light

390
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,720
and so that light came down on the bunny

391
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,079
in the bushes and I said light light

392
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,240
light and a day later the bunny's leg

393
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,480
was healed it was back out eating grass

394
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,959
and it wasn't even limping the bunny's

395
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,120
leg was healed and it was the same Bunny

396
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,920
and so it was the bunny that we saw

397
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,920
every morning and it was healed from

398
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,839
that light and that is the power of the

399
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,279
light blast that's I've used it my whole

400
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,920
life and so it was just really really a

401
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,839
beautiful thing to be able to do that

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,880

next day after some solid years of

416
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,039
depression or load low mood that gave me

417
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,439

the

490
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,440
world I mean

491
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,760
seriously I'm going to C up some garlic

492
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
right here we're making a healing broth

493
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,159
we'll still talk about the light blast a

494
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,640
little

495
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,600
bit so all through the years profound

496
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,440
experiences with the light blast

497
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,640
profound experiences all through the

498
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:48,440
years and um not just not just um I

499
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,520
mean

500
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:55,039
where

501
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,880
overnight people's bodies just changed

502
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,799
overnight and I have a deep respect for

503
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:05,919
Spirit of compassion and as much as I

504
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:09,400
say you you know I joke around a lot and

505
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,159
I I joke around a lot about being a free

506
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,600
spirit and um and kind of a rebel like

507
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,840
rebelling against Spirit when I was

508
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,200
younger okay and I talk about that a lot

509
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,000
I have um like for instance playing loud

510
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
things and loud music and stuff like

511
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,080
that so I don't have to hear spirit in

512
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,360
my right ear which takes me to another

513
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,919
thing I want to I want to talk about

514
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,600
this you'll notice and I I can't believe

515
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,880
it showed like it did cuz I wasn't

516
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,720
thinking it would and then I I I heard

517
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,679
somebody talking about it where when I

518
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,159
was doing the meet and greet and uh

519
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,720
people were wanted to tell me something

520
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,760
and they want to ask me something right

521
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,480
and I was there standing there I would

522
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,799
use my left ear to hear them so I would

523
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,039
use my left ear to hear the person so it

524
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,320
was like you know

525
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,320
like so great to meet you and and well

526
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,640
aw want to tell you something and I

527
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,120
would actually lean in with my left ear

528
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,919
because with that many people around and

529
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
everything that was going on Spirit of

530
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,480
compassion talks to me in my right ear

531
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,840
so even though I hear Spirit of

532
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,960
compassion in my left ear it's not like

533
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,000
the right ear the right ear is the

534
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,159
strongest point it's where I hear spirit

535
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
and it comes

536
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,520
through the words come through right

537
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
Spirit comes through and so when I when

538
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
I would talk to somebody somebody I

539
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
would have to lean I would try with my

540
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,559
right ear sometimes be like it's not

541
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,679
going to work there's too many people

542
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,760
here Spirit of compassion is talking to

543
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,200
me about what's happening in people

544
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,480
what's happening people around me people

545
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,799
in back of me information coming through

546
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,559
in that moment not sure who's who where

547
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,840

553
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,480
and have to listen with my left ear and

554
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,760

with my left ear I switched doing that

560
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,279
so I can hear the person focus on what

561
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,200
the person you guys were telling me so

562
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,640
that it wasn't getting in the way with

563
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
Spirit of compassion's information

610
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:29,320
leftover power that the light Blast has

611
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:33,679
and how it's something that it's

612
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,000
like it's this NeverEnding kind of like

613
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,200

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,960
each day goes by it's still there and

615
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,399
it's still doing little things and it's

616
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
helping the immune system and it's

617
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,360
helping it's helping like purify the

618
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,159
liver and it's helping the brain it's

619
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,919
helping to to loosen things that

620
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,880
shouldn't be in there it's helping to

621
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:59,159
you know like rewire it's helping to you

622
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,440
know get shed negative energy negative

623
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,279
energy negative you know like entities

624
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,960
that torment people out

625
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,480
there yeah I

626
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,320
mean people really struggle out there

627
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,720
with so much psychic attack the one

628
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,559
thing I love about the light blast is it

629
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,039
it

630
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,880
obliterates it destroys psychic attack

631
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,080
connections right so if you have this

632
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,600
this this string of energy coming from

633
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,360
somebody who psychically attacking you

634
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,360
if you have this um

635
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
this

636
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,200
basically this wire of negativity going

637
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,440
to you coming from somebody so see

638
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
somebody and even if it went to you when

639
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,440
it's not supposed to like there's

640
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,080
somebody out there hating out there

641
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,720
there's somebody out there that's

642
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,200
throwing out just just static and static

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,799
out there and you happen to be walking

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,919
by or you're in in the the wrong place

645
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,919
whatever at the wrong time and that

646
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,960
static connects to you now you're

647
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,520
getting psychically attacked right or

648
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,840
you're getting psychically attacked by

649
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,200
somebody somebody somebody out there the

650
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,559
light blast

651
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,159
annihilates that psychic attack

652
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,480
connection so everybody in there and I

653
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,600
should have talked about it more but you

654
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,240
know I was just hanging in there trying

655
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,159
to get those light blasts out there but

656
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,000
so if anybody came came into there to

657
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,440
that

658
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
Afterparty and they had a psychic attack

659
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,080
going on that day or there was a

660
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,480
continual on andof Psychic attack from

661
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,679
somebody or something from from far

662
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,640
away anything like that somebody in

663
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,919
their life maybe an old relationship

664
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,200
whatever it is and there's a psychic

665
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,159
attack going on spread of compassion

666
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,519
sends it light down it obliterates that

667
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,320
psychic attack connection boom just cuts

668
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,240
what people would say the cords right

669
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,720
slices that

670
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,919
string or that Essence that's connecting

671
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,760
it that's keeping that static connected

672
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,559
on somebody that's keeping them like

673
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,640
that so they can be mental so they can

674
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:13,640
be super emotional so they can be

675
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,279
doubting themselves so they can be in a

676
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,559
in a like a funk so they can be in a

677
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,919
spell spirit of compassion sends a light

678
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,320
light down to break that boom to shatter

679
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,320
that away whatever that is and to clean

680
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,120
that up to make sure you're clear and

681
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,399
you're free from Psychic attack and

682
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,760
that's what s so does frees people from

683
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,039
Psychic attack that alone is

684
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,600

728
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,000

before four but really nice bathrooms

756
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,799
like that's important the other thing is

757
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,080
the ice packs you know just having that

758
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,120
ice pack in your hand changes your core

759
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,080
temperature in your body just in your

760
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,760
hand you guys and when you're up against

761
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,559
a heat wve all you have to do is just

762
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,200
hold that that cold ice pack for just

763
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:50,360
even five minutes and you what happens

764
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,000
is you got your main arteries that go

765
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,039
right boom down to your hand they go

766
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,919
down your arm right to your hand and so

767
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,960
that main artery that runs right down

768
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,000
here okay you got your ice pack just on

769
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,679
there like right in your hand like that

770
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,720
it it's all that blood that's coming

771
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,559
down your main artery is picking up that

772
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,399
coolness bringing it back up through the

773
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,840
veins right all the way back to your

774
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,240
heart to your brain people are putting

775
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,039
their cold packs on the back of their

776
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,120
neck they're putting them on their face

777
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,159
they're putting them right on their

778
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,679
chest people were putting the cold packs

779
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,720
underneath their hats they were just

780
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,159
doing that and it dropped everybody's

781
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,360
core temperature while waiting out there

782
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,559
for a little bit it it's it's just very

783
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,039
very good good to do it's it was just a

784
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,799
beautiful thing to see everybody getting

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,679
watching online seriously I also love

793
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,279
seeing how many medical medium people

794
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,559
are out there I'm not alone you are not

795
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,559
alone but see the industries would love

796
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,159
to make you feel like you're alone and

797
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,080
the haters would love to make you feel

798
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,639
like you're alone okay and that was kind

799
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,240
of one of the tricks that happened with

800
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:14,000
a lot of the hater you know um campaigns

801
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,440
that were occurring over the last couple

802
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,480
years is to make people feel like

803
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,600
they're isolated or alone or something

804
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,039
like that so to put out things like you

805
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,760
know like oh you're an M or something or

806
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,480
you know the game right and it makes

807
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,080
people feel like oh what am I doing

808
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,000
something bad am I doing something wrong

809
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,159
like what am I doing and that's what

810
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,320
haters do they make you feel like you

811
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,480
know that yeah that you're isolated that

812
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,600
you're the only one following medical

813
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,159
medium that you're the only one that

814
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,320
does medical medium information you know

815
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,600
there are millions of people that do

816
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,039

817
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,679

818
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,399
world doing medical medum

819
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,279
information and you're not

820
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:02,840
alone you know you're not and there are

821
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:06,159

works it's like

833
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,440
I think the haters Industries the system

834
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,639
just want you to feel isolated or

835
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,720
something alone but you're not it's a

836
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:44,280
massive Community massive community in

837
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,919
you know all of the United States and

838
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,320
all around the world and all in the

839
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,440
different countries so yeah Tik Tok just

840
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,320
restricted uh my feed for the next 10

841
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,119
minutes I must be talking about

842
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,359
something all right let's get an onion

843
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,359
in here

844
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,400
the wind must have blew somewhere in a

845
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,839
different

846
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,359
direction all right so I'm going to pop

847
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,359
an onion into this heing

848
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,920
broth so what happened with the light

849
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,320
blast so when I was a child my parents

850
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,160
would um have me in the back seat of the

851
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,200
car we'd be going somewhere we'd be at a

852
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,359
red light Spirit of compassion would

853
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,560
give me a lesson

854
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:35,040
a lesson as to what was going on in

855
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,800
somebody's body emotionally physically

856
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,440
in the next car so it would be at the

857
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,720
red light I'd be in the back seat Spirit

858
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,040
of compassion would say what was going

859
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,920
on with somebody in the car what kind of

860
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,359
health problem were they faced with what

861
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,760
kind of struggle were they faced with so

862
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,440
as I was in the car 10 years old 8 years

863
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,800
old I mean happened all the time over

864
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,640
and over again

865
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,040
uh I would ask Spirit of compassion can

866
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:06,760
we send a light blast on top of that car

867
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,839
so then it was the light blast kind of

868
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,960
like hitting cars with light so I would

869
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,720
be 10 years old backseat of my parents'

870
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,000
car and I would be like you know Spirit

871
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,720
send light down on that car that you

872
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,599
said someone was struggling so we'd be

873
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,280
at the red light and SS would send it

874
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,720
down right on top of the car roof of the

875
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,119
car right through the car into the

876
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,800
crowns of their heads and running right

877
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,280
through them and after a spirit of

878
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
compassion told me that this person's

879
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,359
struggling with a kidney problem this

880
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,560
person's struggling with a heart problem

881
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,000
this person's struggling with diabetes

882
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,079
this person's struggling with you know

883
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,839
some other issue like a liver problem

884
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,640
pancreas problem emotional

885
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,079
struggle

886
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,560
so the light blast became a huge part of

887
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,280
my ever existence and

888
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,240
life I used it wherever I

889
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,960
could I asked Spirit of compassion to

890
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,960
send down the

891
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,480
light thousands of

892
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
times thousands of times and I wonder

893
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,000
who did it affect who did it help I

894
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,280
didn't know the people that were in the

895
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,760
car next to me where are they now what

896
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,520
happened did it help them through their

897
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,520
life at that point

898
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,640
H brand says over there on YouTube the

899

00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,880
hear my guitar one note and I couldn't

913
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,079
hear my voice one note because the sound

914
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,800
text kind of like I think messed

915
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:34,319
something up and the mic on my guitar

916
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,319
wasn't on so they're because when you're

917
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:39,200
out there on a stage that big and you

918
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:41,599
play you can't hear it you can't hear

919
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,240
one note that you're touching when

920
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,800
you're out there everything absorbs it

921
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,040
right and so there was a mic on my

922
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,160
guitar that was off so it wasn't

923
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,119
allowing anyone or or was allowing me

924
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,079
especially to hear what notes I was

925
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,400
playing and if I'm going to sing I do

926
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,440
need to hear the notes cuz I'm not a pro

927
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,000
singer you know but I do need to hear

928
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,839
the notes but didn't and then the other

929
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,520
thing happened was um my monitor was off

930
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,560
so I didn't hear anything I was singing

931
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,760
so it was like just singing to nothing

932
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,920
to air air you couldn't hear it you just

933
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,359
know you were saying the words so I was

934
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,079
trying to sing words didn't hear it at

935
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,640
all through the monitor cuz it wasn't

936
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,440
hooked up and I couldn't hear the guitar

937
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,839
basically I was just standing there like

938
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,119
a naked

939
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,960
baby throwing it all out there later on

940
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,880

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,839
included and like a big part of me was

1045
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,839
there now after the light blast it is

1046
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,240
like my soul got into my body again and

1047
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,040
a weight is lifted off of me so I want

1048
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,280
to say that I want to talk about that

1049
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,559
for a

1050
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,440
second okay I want to talk about that

1051
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:01,079
for a second the thing is with the light

1052
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,800
blast is a lot of people are out of body

1053
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,000
they're having such hard times in their

1054
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,920
life their soul is is is in them a

1055
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
little bit then out of them then in them

1056
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,920
a little bit then out of them it's like

1057
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
a a protection method to protect our

1058
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,480
soul so it doesn't get truly damaged and

1059
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
injured down here on this planet Earth

1060
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,720
of of so much like evil and you know

1061
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,280
trust breaking

1062
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,280
and I mean think about it I mean we know

1063
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,960
planet earth has a lot of evil crap

1064
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,240
going on going down I mean we know that

1065
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,559
you know that if anybody is in complete

1066
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,440
denial of that like they don't think

1067
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,000
evil crap is going on around this planet

1068
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,319
and stuff like that they're in there

1069
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,160
they're in their own little bubble God

1070
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,960
bless them that means it obviously maybe

1071
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,440
it's not affecting them or hasn't

1072
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,240
affected them yet or they just don't

1073
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:55,119
know what is affecting them or not

1074
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:59,200
but man what happens is we get we get

1075
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,800
out of body a lot because of so much uh

1076
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,359
adversity and so much struggle

1077
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,640
and simple little things that could be

1078
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:09,400
simpler little to somebody somebody else

1079
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,280
could be a serious thing for you people

1080
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,280
can get triggered so easily and they can

1081
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,960
their soul can just be popping out of

1082
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:20,640
them left and right because of PTSD P

1083
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,359

01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:40,079
was like like $7,000 in ice packs and

1406
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,920
they never got delivered we lost the

1407
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,720
$7,000 the ice packs just went who knows

1408
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,480
where they were like hijacked somewhere

1409
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:51,240
and we were like no we have to get them

1410
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,559
so then we the Heatwave was

1411
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,680
record-breaking someone we we think

1412
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:58,799
somebody hijacked our ice packs as they

1413
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,799
were being like sent to us we lost the

1414
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,640
hunk of money whatever we just have to

1415
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:07,359
get ice packs we then we went another

1416
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:10,520
route and was like emergency find ice

1417
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,240
packs and a whole another round of ice

1418
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,039
packs and

1419
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:20,000
then because of record

1420
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:23,720
Heatwave right it's like the Afterparty

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,920

1531
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,640
more detail on this and maybe I will at

1532
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:25,279
another event too about everything that

1533
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,599
the songs were special to me because

1534
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:29,520
they remind me of you guys and and

1535
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,279
that's really what it's about too

1536
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,279
somewhere over

1537
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,279
there the whole event blew my mind the

1538
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,920
light blasts were powerful the food was

1539
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:43,960
the best I've ever had and I felt so

1540
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,240
good after I ate it being at an event

1541
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,839
that I didn't have to worry about food

1542
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,880
touched my heart more than you know okay

1543
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,440
that really touches my heart right now

1544
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,680
because when I think about that here you

1545
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,160
are you're at an event and you're not

1546
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,160
worried about what you're eating you're

1547
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,440
not worried about like what is going to

1548
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,359
be in this food what is there canola oil

1549
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,559
in this food and that's the thing there

1550
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:06,520
was no canola oil in that food and

1551
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,720
that's the thing there was no natural

1552
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,640
flavors in that food there was no

1553
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,119
nutritional yeast in that

1554
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:17,039
food there wasn't there was no vinegar

1555
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:18,760
in that food so there was no vinegar in

1556
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,240
that food that was there at the event

1557
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:23,760
how mind-blowing is that no nutritional

1558
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,520
yeast no vinegar

1559
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:30,359
right nothing crazy fermented in that

1560
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:33,720
food like not like nothing Frankenstein

1561
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:37,559

1562
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:40,480

1563
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:44,119
didn't have like you know sneaky crap in

1564
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,119
there things that you have to worry

1565
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:52,480
about there's no citric acid in that

1566
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,480
food there was no dairy in that food

1567
01:07:55,559 --> 01:08:01,640

Amy you know I I think that if

1727
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,000
if you

1728
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:32,320
know one thing Spirit of compassion did

1729
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:35,080
for me was to um to to teach me to do

1730
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,360
everything I could to understand right

1731
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,840
um I always ask Spirit of compassion

1732
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,639
like why me why me you know I did that

1733
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,159
when I was younger I don't do it anymore

1734
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:47,560
really it's it's rare now um but I will

1735
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:49,760
sometimes squeak that out but it's

1736
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,480
nothing like it was when I was younger

1737
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,320
you know when I was in my teens and I

1738
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,440
tell tell Spirit of compassion like why

1739
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,679
me why are you talking to me why why am

1740
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:00,280
I supposed to be helping people why am I

1741
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,000
supposed to someday put all this

1742
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,120
information out there and be that

1743
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,199
messenger and you know can't you find

1744
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,800
somebody else can't you find somebody

1745
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,360
else that's what I would say I I

1746
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,880
remember that was my Mantra you know how

1747
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,040
people have mantras and they have they

1748
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,159
do affirmations it's like and they're

1749
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,040
doing these affirmations my Mantra was

1750
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:20,280
can't you find somebody else you know

1751
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:24,760
when I was a kid and I was like 12 years

1752
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:26,320
old 13 years old and um and I think that

1753
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,320
what what happens is that like Spirit of

1754
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,719
compassion you know gave me some

1755
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,480
valuable lessons and teachings you know

1756
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,239
when I was younger about how it was so

1757
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:38,920
critical so the way you care about that

1758
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:41,280
frog with the in with the injury or the

1759
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,239
way you care about that Bunny with the

1760
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,600
with the broken leg or the way you care

1761
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:48,679
about that grasshopper or that baby bird

1762
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,199
you have to that same compassion and

1763
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:53,159
caring you have to you know find it in

1764
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,679
your heart and care about people and

1765
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:57,600
care about you know indivual uals and I

1766
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,159
remember being taught these lessons in

1767
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,560
very powerful times in my life too when

1768
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:04,280
I was questioning something or

1769
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,960
questioning this as a younger person in

1770
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:08,040
questioning that and spirit of

1771
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,000
compassion would show me and give me

1772
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,560
these these profound pieces of

1773
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,320
information these messages that I would

1774
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,000
use to help me understand you know why

1775
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,080
it's critical to have compassion for

1776
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,920
people it's critical to have compassion

1777
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,679
and to know what 33 years of being sick

1778
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,840
or 10 years of being sick and five years

1779
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:26,560
of being sick

1780
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:30,159
is it doesn't matter if I haven't been

1781
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:33,080
sick for 10 years um I have to know what

1782
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:34,840
that either feels like to some degree or

1783
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,239
understand it to some degree and feel

1784
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,080
that person's feeling and know that it

1785
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:41,840
matters um it matters and it makes a

1786
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,520
difference if we can move that person

1787
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,639
forward and get them through that out of

1788
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,920
the woods and healing to the other side

1789
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:50,320
you know of the into that field the

1790
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,080
beautiful sun coming down on them and to

1791
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,840
be out of that struggle and that

1792
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,120
suffering and to be in touch with that

1793
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,520
Spirit of compassion taught me early on

1794
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,880
you know even when I was a kid that just

1795
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,400

01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:13,159
now and and it something happened I just

1800
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:18,520
just one day it it it clicked when I was

1801
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:20,040

01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,440
way things are going and the health

1820
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:18,280
scene became like political and became

1821
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,800
like um Feeding Frenzy and everybody's

1822
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,960
trying to do shock and awe every 10

1823
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,719
seconds flat and everybody's just

1824
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:26,400
stealing this and doing that is crazy so

1825
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:29,480
Sophie over there norstrom over there on

01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:33,600

1831
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,800
shaking

1832
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:48,840
it okay now that's funny all

1833
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,990
right and it suddenly dawned on me that

1834
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,320
everyone there was

1835
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:56,639
[Laughter]

1836
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,199

1837
01:19:56,639 --> 01:19:59,280
all right that was funny Sophie that's

1838
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:01,800
actually

1839
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,000
hilarious so everybody was moving and

1840
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,920
grooving is what everybody was moving

1841
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,840
and grooving it and suddenly it dawned

1842
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,560
on you that everybody was sober okay

1843
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,800
that's that's hilarious that's

1844
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:17,040
hilarious summer

1845
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,960
5411 people that aren't sick don't

1846
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,920
understand the stress sick people have

1847
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,760
around finding food that's okay having

1848
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,719
food that we knew wouldn't make us sick

1849
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,840
was the most touching part for me you

1850
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:33,560
really thought of everything and at no

1851
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,840
cost to attendees was

1852
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:38,199
mindblowing I I think it's interesting

1853
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,560
you know it was a new a new experience

1854
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:43,639
for me when you feed when you feed a a

1855
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,840
large crowd of people like that and then

1856
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:48,600
you feed them and no no cost mattered it

1857
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,040
didn't matter it just had to be the best

1858
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,840
it had to be the best of everything and

1859
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:55,760
we had to make it happen and um it was a

1860
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:59,159
it was an experience

1861
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,120
because who does that right but but

1862
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:03,000
being that I had to be I mean I have to

1863
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,040
experience it myself because word doing

1864
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,719
it it's an experience on its own it was

1865
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,920
really interesting there's so much I was

1866
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,480
learning from that experience of making

1867
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,840
sure we had what we had for everybody

1868
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:16,159
and how it was going it was really

1869
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,800
awesome I think that and you know

1870
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:21,320
sitting down and enjoying the food like

1871
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:25,080
I did was um was just really exciting on

1872
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:27,120
its own for me it just was

1873
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,520
um Sophie over there on YouTube says

1874
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,440
thank you for the light infused cards I

1875
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,840
saw that and the the message are going

1876
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,960
up but I think that like I want to talk

1877
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,760
about that too and we read some more

1878
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:39,480
notes but the light infused cards um

1879
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,159
it's what what I love about the light

1880
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:44,480
infused card infused cards is that

1881
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:47,600
Spirit of compassion doesn't just send

1882
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:50,239
the light down once on the cards it's

1883
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,760
like s so is sending light down a

1884
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,280
multiple times on the card so as I'm

1885
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,120
signing all those cards and they're

1886
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,920
being stacked up it's like every 10

1887
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:00,040
minutes I mean it took a long time to

1888
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,320
sign all the cards but every 10 minutes

1889
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,679
Spirit of compassion would send light

1890
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:07,000
down on the cards and that's just it it

1891
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:08,719
just it feels so good to see that okay

1892
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,320

2067
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:55,239
Barbara Soul lightness Academy over

try to transport myself there right and

2076
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,280
I'm going to talk someday more about the

2077
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:21,679
present moment and the future and the

2078
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,199
past and telegram I talk about it

2079
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:26,199

01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,280
Saturday because it was it was that

2084
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:43,199
incredible Jackie says on YouTube

2085
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,080
Anthony we were chosen because your

2086
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:47,440
heart is like no other you give

2087
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:50,800
endlessly with no

2088
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:55,360
BS like The Fakes out there you love and

2089
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,360
care for us like no other could

2090
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,400
except this mm

2091
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:00,400
family

2092
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:04,840
wow look I try not to like talk about

2093
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:07,040
like The Fakes out there or talk about

2094
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:09,159
the BS out there but I do every now and

2095
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,320
then I can't help it there's a lot of BS

2096
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:13,280
out

2097
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:14,920
there I think a lot of influencers that

2098
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,040
are in the health realm whether they're

2099
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,080
authors in the health realm or they just

2100
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,080
want to take advantage and they're

2101
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,840
running 20 billion ads at a time trying

2102
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,440
to sell their their courses or whatever

2103
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,040
they're doing I think that

2104
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:29,520
they they're they're like they see The

2105
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:34,080
Chronic eel as a cash cow you know like

2106
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:37,159
just one big fat massive Cash Cow you

2107
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,280
know and it's like and it's it's obvious

2108
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,520
like what do they really know about

2109
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,760
chronically ill and what do they know

2110
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,400
about people in they're suffering and

2111
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,719
struggling but they know this ch- ching

2112
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:47,199
ch- ching ch- ching they definitely know

2113
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:50,360
that you can see it everywhere out

2114
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:52,639
there I get it you have to make a living

2115
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,760
people have to make money yeah darn

2116
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,719
right and you should work and and try to

2117
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,040
do that if you can but there's a

2118
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,920
difference when it comes down to the

2119
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:02,520
health scene it's turned into a Feeding

2120
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:06,239

either didn't hear any of it it was just

2298
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,400
basically I was just hitting notes as if

2299
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:53,880
it was in the air and I was singing

2300
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,920
words that were in the air because I had

2301
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,159
no monitors and no way to know what was

2302
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,599

2307
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,920
over there on YouTube when you were

2308
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:18,920
singing I couldn't stop listening your

2309
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:21,239
music was going directly to my heart

2310
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,119
that's more than I can ask for it's more

2311
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:26,760
than I can ask for now Alison the way we

2312
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:29,599
were all treated at Aran and the other

2313
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,199
venue is the true definition to comp of

2314
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:35,199
compassion we were so nurtured and cared

2315
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:37,119
for that is the best thing I can hear

2316
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:40,599
because that's what I was hoping and I

2317
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:43,719
was praying before it all happened and I

2318
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:46,480
wanted the the best feeling to occur and

2319
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:49,199
I wanted I wanted you guys to know how

2320
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,199
much I cared

2321
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:55,520
and this is hot just don't burn your

2322
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,639
tongue when you drink yours fly high

2323
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,560
said over there on YouTube guys there is

2324
01:41:57,639 --> 01:42:02,560
an mm playlist on Spotify with all the

2325
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,520
songs from the

2326
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:09,159
event highly requested we did put out a

2327
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,159
playlist because it was highly highly

2328
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:18,239
requested I like making noise when I sip

2329
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,239
really hot soup so just bear with me

2330
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:23,920
rise of melum says YouTube the security

2331
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:26,360
at the event was very polite and

2332
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,199
respectful although there was a lot

2333
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:30,639
going on I really loved it so there so

2334
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,560
here's how it works with the security at

2335
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:34,920
the event security of the vent is to

2336
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,840
protect the medical meme

2337
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,400
Community you know it's to make sure

2338
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,679
that they're

2339
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:46,159
safe that's really what it is it's their

2340
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:48,639
I had my two guys you know like I had my

2341
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:50,400
guys right but the rest of the security

2342
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:52,679
is for the community because you just

2343
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:56,199
don't know who can just walk right in
