149
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,479
we're making some drinks i'm going to

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
talk about wild blueberry

151
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199
we're going to talk about wild blueberry

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
juice we're going to talk about the

153
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
antioxidants we're going to talk about

154
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,039
the power

155
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
the antioxidants have chris stitch

156
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,599
exactly is it twitch or it's twitch

157
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,080
right it's twitch it's switch i like

158
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,440
that one it's twitch all right

159
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840
so

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,039
a lot of things to understand is as we

161
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,639
age why do we age like as we're aging

162
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,000
you can age good and you can age bad but

163
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,240
we all age you can't stop from aging you

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,800
can't shut aging down a hundred percent

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
where it stops okay it doesn't work like

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,080
that because

167
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,879
all right as the earth is traveling

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,080
around the sun

169
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,039
it's impossible to stop the earth from

170
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,639
traveling around the sun so you're going

171
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,840
to age

172
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,520
but

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,120
there's a difference between aging badly

174
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,720
or aging

175
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,800
goodly it's goodly a word right so aging

176
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
good or aging bad and that's the

177
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
difference right there so we're not

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
going to be able to stop the aging

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,800
process completely because the earth's

180
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
going around the sun

181
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,840
and every time it goes around the sun we

182
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
age regardless of what but

183
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,599
physically

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
everything matters as far as what we put

185
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,199
inside our body to stop from oxidizing

186
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
to stop the oxidation process

187
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,919
everything matters

188
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,800
to stop all of the decaying that happens

189
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,120
inside our body right stop the process

190
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,120
of acids eating us up alive stop the

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,279
process of chemicals and pathogens and

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
everything getting to our

193
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,040
bones and getting to our organs and

194
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
getting to our brain and getting to our

195
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
liver right

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
all of that matters

197
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
so

198
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,399
when it comes down to it when it comes

199
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,160
down to it we want that antioxidant

200
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
power

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,040
because that's critical

202
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
for our survival it just is antioxidants

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,680
play a huge role

204
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,760
in the whole free radical thing so what

205
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
is the free radical thing anyway what is

206
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,320
it

207
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
it's any kind of toxin that's floating

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
around in our bloodstream in our body

209
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
any kind of poison that's in the air

210
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
that we breathe any kind of

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
you know

212
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,880
toxic substance that we were born with

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
inside our body passed down from

214
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
generation from generation

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,279
anything we get exposed to

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,839
from anything that's floating around

217
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,839
anything we ingest right all of it toxic

218
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,839
heavy metals pathogens and everything so

219
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:39,040
basically that's just one summing up one

220
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:41,680
big free radical circus right there and

221
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,800
our cells are up against all of that

222
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,839
that's what happens so we can age kindly

223
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:54,080
and we can age unkindly right

224
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,480
so the key is how we protect ourselves

225
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
from that aging process at least giving

226
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
them a shot so as we're putting

227
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
ourselves through what we put ourselves

228
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,959
through all the years of caffeine people

229
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
have done or all the years of

230
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,240
pizza they've done or all the years of

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,640
burgers or all the years of exposure or

232
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,160
whatever it is that they're up against

233
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,279
throughout their life all the years of

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
stress all the years of adrenaline

235
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,760
it's critical that our cells stand a

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
chance so antioxidants are a big part of

237
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,839
it anthocyanins polyphenols antioxidants

238
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
all matter

239
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,320
and so the thing i love about wild

240
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,560
blueberry and wild blueberry juice has

241
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,000
manganese in it

242
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,959
right so it has

243
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,240
naturally occurring manganese in it and

244
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,519
a very amazing amount of it which is

245
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,440
incredible and that's the thing about

246
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
the wild blueberry manganese is that

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
is that mineral

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
right that links

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,519
the antioxidant use inside our body and

250
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,200
that's the connection right there so

251
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,680
manganese is critical when it comes down

252
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
to antioxidants manganese is critical

253
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
when it comes down to cells and organs

254
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
in every single part of our body and so

255
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
when people drink wild blueberry juice

256
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,480
and they say like a family member says

257
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
wow i feel better

258
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
because i had some and i feel better

259
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,079
or if someone drinks it and they feel

260
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,079
like they're stabilizing

261
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,320
or they feel like they're feeling

262
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,560
stronger or they feel energy come back

263
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
or they feel a headache go away or they

264
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,880
feel right

265
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
or they feel their dizziness go away

266
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,200
i got a friend that's

267
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
dizzy on and off throughout the day

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
every time

269
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
they started what they started up with

270
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
the wild blueberries you start doing the

271
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
wild blueberry juice they call me up

272
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,320
they're like how come it goes away

273
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
and so it's it's one of these things

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,279
where

275
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
and i'm not saying it does that i'm just

276
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,360
saying these are experiences people have

277
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
that i see out there right

278
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,320
and so anyway what i love about the wild

279
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
blueberry juice though is the color

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
it's one of the things i love those

281
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,959
anthocyanins that color

282
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
is very special all in its own so we

283
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
have to realize what's in that pigment

284
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,959
what's going on inside of there all

285
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
these things matter so anyway we're here

286
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,160

of them earlier

313
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,000
before we had a tech problem

314
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,279
so you can do a little bit of a shot

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
each day

316
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
i have people they put them in my family

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,000
members i put them into their smoothies

318
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,680
they do them in their heavy metal detox

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
movies whatever people that put them in

320
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,480
their smoothies in general

321
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
all right so let's make a drink right

322
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
now we're going to make honey orange and

323
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
wild blueberry refresher

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,000
that's what we're doing now

325
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
so let's get a cup out

326
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,519
all right so in this one we're gonna put

327
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,800
a whole bunch of wild blueberry juice in

328
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,160
this

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,000
so let's crack open a new bottle

330
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
is what we're gonna do good to see you

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
guys

332
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
sophia said okay great just ordered

333
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
you won't be disappointed it tastes

334
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
incredible

335
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,279
you know what i noticed too

336
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,320
it's not sickly sweet so it's not when

337
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,360
people see this it's not sickly sweet

338
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,360
like grape juice no way

339
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,720
no way it's pleasant it's refreshing

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,480
it's not sickly sweet at all you can

341
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,560
taste the medicinal properties it's an

342
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
entirely different experience which is

343
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,639
incredible you gotta understand like

344
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,360
what it takes to actually get these out

345
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,440
of the field harvest them

346
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,920
get them to the press

347
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
press them

348
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
get the juice in the bottle and i'm

349
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,839
going to talk about the

350
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
why the quality matters and everything

351
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
else that's happening with the quality

352
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,000
of this as well so that's important too

353
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,000
does not raise blood sugar

354
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
right

355
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,440
low glycemic for the people who are

356
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
worried about blood sugar like raising

357
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,839
blood sugar or anything

358
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,760
because the berries are low glycemic

359
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,519
fruit that's what that is it's a low

360
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
glycemic fruit for the people that are

361
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,160
worried about that that's a whole nother

362
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
game all on its own right

363
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,760
all right so let's get some wild

364
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
blueberry juice in here that's what

365
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,839
we're gonna do maybe we'll get a

366
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,639
close-up to this drink too as well

367
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
so we're gonna put

368
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
a whole bunch in there because now we're

369
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
making

370
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,760
right

371
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,160
so i'm putting roughly about like you

372
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,920
know cup a little over a half cup right

373
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,600
there while blueberry juice right then

374
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,800
i'm gonna put some freshly squeezed

375
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
orange juice in there too

376
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,000
i'm gonna knock some of this in here

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360

449
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,039

450
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,440
different things if you just want to

451
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,559
take a champagne glass

452
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
right

453
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
just a champagne glass alone you can you

454
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
can go that route too because i made

455
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,840
that

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
fancy drink

457
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
a little while ago right but you can

458
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
just do champagne glasses you can do

459
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,559
wine glasses

460
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,160
you can do a lot of different things

461
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,440
with it too when you have people over

462
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,520
all right so the next one we're gonna

463
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,840
make is a sparkling wild blueberry juice

464
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,840
and lime so let's do it

465
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
that one we're using a champagne glass

466
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,520
here it is okay

467
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
so this is gonna be fun we're gonna put

468
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
a little bit of blueberry juice in this

469
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,320
one

470
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
we are

471
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,240
okay

472
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,600
a little bit of blueberry juice in there

473
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,679
like that then we're gonna do some

474
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
sparkling water

475
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
next

476
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,160
we're not going to do ice in this one

477
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
little sparkling water

478
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,400
here we go

479
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,400
this is a champagne

480
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,679
i think we're going a little too high up

481
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,120
on that

482
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,400
we're not trying to fill that

483
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,400
now we're gonna get a lime

484
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,600
don't throw fruit around when you have

485
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,760
all this going on

486
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,840
all this blue juice going around don't

487
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,840
throw anything that's just my advice

488
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,919
if you have carpets that's a lime with

489
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,240
no juice in it how do you like that oh

490
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,840
we got a little bit in there

491
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,960
so we're gonna put a little lime juice

492
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,240
in this one so we got the sparkling

493
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,240
water

494
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,840
this is the sparkling wild blueberry

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,480
juice and lime

496
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,360
drink

497
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
nice

498
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,400
you don't want you when you're serving

499
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
it you don't want it kind of gross

500
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
looking where there's some lime or

501
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
something on the side let's just clean

502
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
that up

503
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
right

504
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679

505
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,320

506
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
going to get another lime

507
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120

508
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
we're going to cut this you guys want to

509
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,480

510
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,559
i do i'll just knock down a couple of

567
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
shots every single morning

568
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,000
and then you can do all kinds of stuff

569
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,000
you can do the wine thing if you want

570
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,320
right you can do that like

571
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,880
i mean honestly i treat this like a wine

572
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,840
now i'm not a wine drinker

573
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,480
right

574
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,200
but you can treat this like a wine

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,440
very easily

576
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,840
especially if you have company over

577
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,640
fantastic and it goes great with meals

578
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
too

579
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
dinners

580
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,280
any kind of meal goes really good with

581
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,840
too so

582
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,840
and you can

583
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,240
yes

584
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440

585
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880

oh dear

587
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,480

588
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,559
wine

589
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,000
i didn't want it this dry

590
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,000
let's see how dry it really is

591
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,120

592
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
you can spit it back out

593
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,600
you can just spit it back out is there a

594
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,320

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679

598
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,400

this wine

607
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,200
how much is it fifty four thousand

608
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,960
dollars a glass i think that's a

609
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,360
perfectly good price

610
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,520

611
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,520

650
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,799
if you use white towels i just have a

651
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
little

652
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,400
tip just

653
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,159
be cautious if you're using white towels

654
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,559

689
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,880
okay but it's a it's a gift

690
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,840
i mean from heaven really that the wild

691
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,919
blueberries are even here on this planet

692
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,799
to help us which is incredible all on

693
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,720
its own and then the harvesting being

694
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,240
able to harvest them get them into a

695
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
juice and we'll talk about this this

696
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,600
juice is not hpp

697
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,640
and that's something to understand right

698
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
so

699
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,559
people think they're buying raw juices

700
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
when they're not someone said is this

701
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,840
raw no it's not raw raw is

702
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,960
you take the fruit like this

703
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
right

704
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,240
and you squeeze it and you drink it

705
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
that's raw

706
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,200
now if you see something that says it's

707
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,279
raw

708
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,440
on the shelf and it's got like an

709
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,120
expiration date of two weeks or a month

710
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,679
and it's all those juices and they're in

711
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,600
bottles those aren't raw

712
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,559
those are not fresh

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,320
those are hpp they're pasteurized so you

714
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,399
have to understand what's happening so

715
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,240
you're not getting any raw juice unless

716
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,320
you take celery or something and you run

717
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,039
it through a juicer

718
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,760
or you take a raw fruit but the wild

719
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,679
blueberries they're only around in north

720
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,480
america for this very short window of

721
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,200
harvesting so no one has the chance to

722
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,000
just get it fresh right meaning like

723
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,039
picked off well what they do is they

724
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,399
pick them

725
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,919
right

726
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,679
they freeze them

727
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,679
so we have the frozen wild blueberries

728
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,120
which is incredible that's one of the

729
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
amazing things about the wild blueberry

730
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,880
you freeze them right we can also

731
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,880
press them

732
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,960
and make them into this incredible juice

733
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,360
which is a whole other thing too

734
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
but when someone says oh it's not raw

735
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,039
it's pasteurized what they don't

736
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
understand is every juice that's in the

737
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,960
market doesn't matter where it is in the

738
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,880
cold section you think all the juices

739
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,559
you're getting are raw when they're not

740
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
all those different brands all those

741
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,520
marketing strategies they have or

742
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
they're fresh and they say raw they're

743
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,679
not they're actually it should be legal

744
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,279
when they say that should actually be

745
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,120
illegal because

746
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,279
they're not disclosing the fact that

747
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,960
it's every bit of it's been pasteurized

748
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,440
and here's the problem

749
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,120
they're using hpp

750
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,240
that pasteurization damages

751
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,480
damages the integrity of those

752
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,480
phytochemical compounds it damages it

753
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,399
because they're using

754
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
uh they're using a high pressure

755
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,440
pasteurization which

756
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,679
injures

757
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,080
the cell structure of everything people

758
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,640
don't realize that so

759
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,720
they don't do that here right they don't

760
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,600
use that which is incredible so that

761
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,399
part alone is off the charts amazing

762
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,200
which which is a big deal so the

763
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,200
medicinal properties stay intact that's

764
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
