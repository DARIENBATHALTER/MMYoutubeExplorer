71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,120

long time

155
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,020
because I don't think they notify

156
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,300
everybody but that's pretty much

157
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,580
everywhere Carol says what do you mean

158
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,520
by toxic blood or whenever we feel like

159
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,180
our blood is so toxic we can sense it we

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,180
have intuitive nature inside of us where

161
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,900

they know everything about it but they

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,259
say one when they don't even know

184
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,419

see I believe that because I have a

189
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,440
friend that's doing this shot right now

190
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,080
and I'm watching a friend of mine get

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,479
their life back so that that's just so

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,160
powerful and I know this shot works the

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,500
spirit of compassion is information but

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,880
it's so it's so incredible all right so

195
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,380
let's read about the Vegas Nerfs I'm so

196
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,060
glad you guys are commenting I want to

197
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,880
read some comments I'm excited about

198
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,199
this the special time we're day three of

199
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,000
the medical and brain shot therapy

200
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,460
cleanse challenge

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,919
the vagus nerves are made up of tiny

202
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,240
strands and strings of nerve cells that

203
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,240
run the length of the nerves

204
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,800
a vagus nerve is not just one solid

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,380
nerve

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,000
yep that's interesting why do I care

207
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,460
about that why do I even give a crap

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,840
about that because the industry thinks

209
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,840
it's just one solid nerve

210
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,819
I mean it's not it's not one solid nerve

211
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,340
a vagus nerve is not just one solid

212
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,360
nerve it's a complex weave of nerve

213
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,419
cells

214
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,419
but it's a weave of nerve cells

215
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,280
this is similar to how the other cranial

216
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,340
nerves work although not identical

217
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,460
this complexity Works in our favor so I

218
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,279
want to talk about why vagus nerves this

219
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,140
weave construction that they have this

220
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,580
weave design that they have why is it

221
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,839
beneficial for us if you just got on

222
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,159
here we're talking about vagus nerves so

223
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,500
what that means is

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,740
a lot of mystery symptoms burning

225
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,920
burning feelings inside everything from

226
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,140
like intestinal spasms and cramping

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,180
gastroparesis to tightness of the chest

228
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,279
to anxiety to all kinds of different

229
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,080
things the vagus nerves play a huge role

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,040
I just saw Dr Fond go up over there on

231
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,040
IG

232
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,200
hello hello glad you're here

233
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,839
this complexity Works in our favor when

234
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
vagus nerve inflammation occurs you guys

235
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,380
and that's the big thing right there

236
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,380
vagus nerve inflammation

237
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,019
the health industry never knew that when

238
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,360
vagus nerves are inflamed we have

239
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,860
problems

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,420
I hate sounding like a broken record but

241
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,980
it's a medical medium info about Vegas

242
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,260
there's becoming inflamed by pathogens

243
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,640
and toxins and what that does is it

244
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,260
inflames your vagus nerves and the

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,779
winter vagus nerves get inflamed we get

246
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,300
all these symptoms but nobody knew if

247
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,580
you were around in this industry looking

248
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,080
for help 10 years ago you would have

249
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,000
never found that there it just doesn't

250
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,320
exist you just get told oh it's all in

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,760
your head you're crazy or you're not

252
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,480
sick or

253
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,000
or whatever it's something else

254
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,860
when Vegas nerve inflammation occurs it

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,740
may affect multiple strings within a

256
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,180
vagus nerve yet yet yet not every single

257
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,959
string of the nerves I want to talk

258
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,080
about that so when our vagus nerves okay

259
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,300
when our vagus nerves are inflamed it

260
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,339
doesn't mean all the strings inside your

261
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,060
vagus nerve are inflame and that makes

262
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,640
up all the complexities of your pain

263
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,660
your stomach gastric pain your

264
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,820
gastroparesis your tightness of the

265
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,860
chest here your tightness of the abdomen

266
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,779
up here you can't take a deep breath

267
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,279
down here but you can take a better

268
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,820
breath up here

269
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,040
it all depends on where the inflammation

270
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,080
is on the vagus nerve medical research

271
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,200
and science has no idea about this about

272
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,500
the complexity about where in the in the

273
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,540
vagus nerve is the inflammation or vagus

274
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,760
nerves which leads us to one other thing

275
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,839
what if you're inflamed in the vagus

276
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,060
nerve but not in the other vagus nerve

277
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,279
what if you're inflamed in one part of

278
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,260
one vagus nerve but inflamed in another

279
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,260
part in another Vegas nerve the

280
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,300
complexities are insane that's why no

281
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,940
one's symptoms are identical it's

282
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,519
impossible to have an exact identical

283
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,140
symptom even though it sounds identical

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,399
seems like it it's still going to be a

285
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,600
different sensation than somebody

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,920
because of all these different

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,959
complexities

288
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,959
the very the variables the variations

289
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,459
this complexity Works in our favor when

290
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,260
Vegas starts inflammation occurs it may

291
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,880
affect multiple strings within a vagus

292
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,279
there but yet not every string of the

293
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,640
nerve which saves our butt

294
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,800
it's how we survive if our vagus nerves

295
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,079
are inflamed

296
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,140
if they're inflamed we can still

297
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,440
function many times because only some

298
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,500
strings in the vagus nerve are inflamed

299
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,060
only some so it makes it so we can

300
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,620
function and live our life but even

301
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,820
though we feel broken and that we're

302
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,640
sick

303
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,560
Renata says I feel mine inflamed in

304
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,839
multiple different parts due to symptoms

305
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,300
is that possible notice that the whole

306
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,160
thing so many people have their nerves

307
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,160
inflamed in so many different places

308
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,880
this means inflammation does not take

309
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,579
over an entire vagus nerve because

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,000
that's how we survive if inflammation

311
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,800
takes over your entire vagus nerve then

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,720
you're going to be in trouble

313
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,660
you're really going to have some harsh

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,660
symptoms but even if that happens

315
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,959
there's a chance the other vagus nerve

316
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,600
on the other side okay of your the other

317
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,959
cranial nerve the vagus nerve is not

318
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,760
completely or fully inflamed so this way

319
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,760
you're still hanging in there

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,260
it also means symptoms can move and

321
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,060
shift if nerve-strand inflammation moves

322
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,440
and shift and that's another thing so

323
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,060
many people are like well I had all

324
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,160
these symptoms but they're different now

325
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,720
had all these symptoms but they're

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,779
changed

327
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,120
I had all these symptoms but they're not

328
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,820
the same symptoms but they kind of are

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,100
the inflammation is changing within the

330
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,100
vagus nerves

331
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,980
so it's actually changing with the value

332
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,079
stirring Sharon says I searched for

333
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,820
years for an explanation why I could not

334
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
take a deep breath

335
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,260
teach wow incredible on IG you should re

336
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,139
then you must have read this to find out

337
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,839
why the information is so so intense

338
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,240
Health with Liz good to see you on IG

339
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,399
I've been doing this brain shot for the

340
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,860
past three days and it's gotten rid of

341
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,839
my acidy Sensations I have to tell you

342
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,660
this brain shot

343
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,560
right whether you do all cilantro as an

344
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,720
option or all parsley is

345
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,060
unbelievable unbelievable

346
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,980
while blueberry dreams I have multiple

347
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,860
sclerosis and medical medium information

348
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,380
is helping me restore my nerves I was

349
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,540
going to have a shoulder surgery and

350
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,880
turns out I didn't even need to have it

351
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,740
so thankful I didn't go through with it

352
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,160
oh God bless you amazing that you're

353
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,600
doing so much better I'm so so happy for

354
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,120
you

355
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,300
I really am

356
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,540
Susan Blondo says love that informed us

357
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,480
love that informed us about our two

358
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,240
vagus nerves learn so much from you you

359
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,399
are a great teacher thank you thank you

360
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,920
I try to message the information

361
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,160
the spirit of compassion

362
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,459
and knowing about these two nerves is

363
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,200
critical so I am a messenger and happy

364
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,480
to message

365
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,880
okay

366
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,399
it also means symptoms can move and

367
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,300
shift if nerves Rand inflammation moves

368
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,459
and shift

369
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,800
if the cause of inflammation is

370
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,740
aggressive

371
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,420
inflammation can breach onto other nerve

372
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,880
strands so if you've got some really

373
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,260
intense inflammation in the vagus nerves

374
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:49,199
okay it can breach into other strands

375
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,220
inside of the vagus nerve signs of

376
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
research doesn't have any of this

377
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,360
information about any of that about how

378
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,839
inflammation works in the vase nerve

379
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,740
this is this is literally groundbreaking

380
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,139
life-changing information that doesn't

381
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,160
exist out there

382
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:08,639
let's see Spirit filleted kitchen says I

383
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,620
always knew it was my vagus nerve didn't

384
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,000
know it was nerves I was researching and

385
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,639
researching about

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
you're the only one who knew this

387
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,519
so let's keep on going a little bit more

388
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,800
you guys if you just got here we're

389
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,680
going to be making the nerve acid but

390
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,940
the nerve gut acid stabilizer it's an

391
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,320
insane

392
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,820
brain shot therapy it's incredible I'm

393
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,380
just really pumped up about it I've been

394
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,480
telling people about Vegas nerves so

395
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,740
what symptoms are caused for over 35

396
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,120
years

397
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,660
was called the vagus nerve guy years ago

398
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,000
just like us called the Epstein-Barr guy

399
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,740
guess what it was called the zinc guy

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,920
which is why everybody's like zinc Zing

401
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,260
for everything now hooting C

402
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,380
and the whole bit Wild Heart kitchen

403
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,920
says I'm a naturopathic practitioner

404
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,839
cool and am learning so much from you a

405
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,839
lot which blows what I've been taught

406
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,060
out of the water I love it incredible so

407
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,040
so wild heart do you have the brain

408
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,899
saver books do you have liberal rescue

409
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,019
do you have cleansed to heal the

410
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,040
information blows my mind every day it

411
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,899
just does

412
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,399
and thank you for actually reading the

413
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,680
books and learning

414
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,100
France's family chef says I did this

415
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,339
with all parsley had the family take it

416
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,800
too helped with more than I could say

417
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,720
it's it's probably one of my favorites

418
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,899
favorites but there's so many medical

419
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,060
medium tools that blow my mind and offer

420
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,040
so much relief and so much movement

421
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,660
forward for people it's hard to say

422
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,880
which ones are my favorite it's just

423
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,240
hard I mean

424
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,060
heavy metal detox movie is insane the

425
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,220
cleanses are insane the monocleanse the

426
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,199
whatever 369 that nerve gut acid

427
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,699
stabilizer like all of it but we're

428
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,899
doing brain shot therapy so I'm not

429
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,120
going to get carried away with myself

430
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,799
right now

431
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,140
game

432
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,160
if the nerve strand inflammation moves

433
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,839
and shifts you guys we're talking about

434
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
nerve strands inside your vagus nerves

435
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,160
being becoming inflamed

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,740
if the cause of inflammation is

437
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,140
aggressive inflammation can breach onto

438
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,419
other nerve strands where inflammation

439
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,520
can go up and down

440
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,380
slightly pressuring

441
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,419
pressurizing and pushing different

442
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,380
strands of nerve cells within an area of

443
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,580
a vagus nerve leading to Milder

444
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,440
phantom-like symptoms that come and go

445
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,679
so someone could be like why is my

446
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,440
symptoms moving around

447
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,880
why are my symptoms moving around

448
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
why

449
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm telling a doctor it's kind of here

450
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,220
now it's kind of here

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,020
I'm telling my doctor it's kind of here

452
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,020
but now it's kind of here

453
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,559
telling my doctor it's kind of here now

454
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,260
it's kind of here

455
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,960
but now it's both but now it's not

456
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,780
anymore it's kind of here

457
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,400
vegaser of inflammation strands becoming

458
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,400
inflamed

459
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,679
inside the vagus nerves and moving the

460
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,720
symptoms around the sensations and the

461
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,080
feelings you're feeling moving them

462
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,080
around

463
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,039

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,000
the doctor that buys the vineyard in

480
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Napa Valley

481
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,460
and I make fun of doctors and all the

482
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,039
way it doesn't mean I don't have respect

483
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,179
for doctors Dr Alejandra younger an

you know wrote the forward on the on

486
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,059
these brain saver books

487
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,200
it's you know the point I'm trying to

488
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,200
say is

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,660
um definitely honored you're here I talk

490
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,160
to doctors a lot

491
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,620
for years

492
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,660
providing information

493
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,660
for their very difficult cases

494
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,340
all right still these Phantom symptoms

495
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,740
any person's

496
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,840
and a person's main more definable

497
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,820
symptoms are less severe than they would

498
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,740
be if inflammation were taking over the

499
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,480
entire nerve and creating more severe

500
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,679
symptoms that would complicate someone's

501
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,860
suffering further so what I'm trying to

502
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,820
say is your vagus nerves you got two of

503
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,100
them

504
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,840
both can be slightly inflamed in

505
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,740
different nerve strands inside the vagus

506
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
nerves

507
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,600
you can be getting Sensations everywhere

508
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:09,299
you can be the most confusing patient to

509
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,820
a doctor really confusing burning skin

510
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,919
twitches and spasms

511
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,200
tightness in the chest you can have the

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,179
vagus nerves inflamed in all various

513
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,520
areas and then feeling like you can't

514
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,320
digest your food at all feeling like you

515
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,539
can't digest anymore could even be

516
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,460
involved

517
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,580
The Details Matter

518
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,580
all these details can give you peace of

519
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,640
mind as you are confused and going to

520
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,620
your 10th Doctor neurologist this is

521
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,299
information brain care doctor the point

522
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,400
is is it brings peace of mind because

523
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,720
when we don't know what's wrong and we

524
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,580
had everything checked out and

525
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,340
everything looks okay but we don't have

526
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,320
an answer having an answer is a huge

527
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,320
relief it's a big deal

528
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,460
that's the difference between medical

529
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,400
medium and everything else you can get

530
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,020
out there the details are in here about

531
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,700
it so if you hear about Vegas nerve out

532
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,080
there you can't get the details about it

533
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,280
all

534
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
you can't learn about the different

535
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
strands but not just that the different

536
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,340
symptoms involved and not just that

537
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,020
what's inflaming the vagus nerves heck

538
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,000
that's the most important piece of it

539
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,340
what's in flaming your vagus nerves

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,380
answers and details on how and why to

541
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,539
heal your vagus nerves that's the other

542
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,980
point

543
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,260
kind of getting carried away I'm getting

544
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,820
ready for my nerve gut acid stabilizer

545
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,780
matter of fact

546
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,400
Elvis lives I really liked Elvis and I

547
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,919
like Elvis's music so that's pretty cool

548
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,320
Elvis lives this explains so much my

549
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,059
strange nerve Sensations move around too

550
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,880
so your strange nerve Sensations are

551
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,860
actually moving around

552
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,919
yes that's how it works it explains it

553
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,900
lupus free with celery33 I used to choke

554
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,520
on food easily until I started medical

555
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,220
meaning protocols which means you were

556
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,380
healing the vagus nerves you were

557
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,059
healing the cranial nerves that's what

558
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,539
you were doing using medical medium was

559
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:03,000
healing the vagus nerves

560
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,520
endocranial nerves

561
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
anybody watching this take the books to

562
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
your doctors

563
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,179
pray daily says I feel I'm still alive

564
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:18,720
because of you and compassionate spirit

565
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:21,000
compassionate Spirit indeed

566
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,820
I try my best throughout my life to be

567
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,980
as compassion as possible

568
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,440
and any way I possibly can because I do

569
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,240
know one thing that when you're sick and

570
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,919
you're down and you're suffering and

571
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,659
don't have an answer and you tried

572
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,280
everything and you feel like you're

573
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:40,200
losing hope

574
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:43,020
it is hell and then some and what I do

575
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,640
is I think about that I think about what

576
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,559
it's like to be in your shoes if you

577
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
have all these symptoms that means

578
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,580
you're suffering if you are struggling

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,580
and don't have an answer and you feel

580
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,580
these symptoms I have to realize and I

581
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,220
have in my life that if I try to really

582
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,900
connect with that and say Anthony

583
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,120
aw

584
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,860
you're not sick you don't have those

585
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,299
symptoms

586
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,380
but

587
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,720
what if you did feel those symptoms

588
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,080
now connect to that person psychically

589
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,980
connect to that person

590
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,840
telepathically

591
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,760
you know connect to that person listen

592
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,940
to Spirit of compassion on how bad that

593
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,100
person's suffering and

594
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,100
connect with that

595
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,980
and feel that and what would it be like

596
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,059
in their shoes and when I think about

597
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,659
that

598
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:38,760
and I feel that it's like

599
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,559
you you could see everything you know

600
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,080
especially if you're psychic right you

601
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,000
could see everything you can see

602
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,620
the phone calls they always have to make

603
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,900
how they're not well enough to get out

604
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,700
of bed how they're always like they need

605
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,100
help how they need help they need people

606
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,720
to bring them food how like

607
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:00,000
how nobody believes them around them how

608
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,799
they're they they hate themselves for

609
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,919
having these symptoms like I feel it all

610
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,780
and I understand it all and and I'm just

611
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,320
scratching the surface

612
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,320
all right

613
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,039
because of the vagus nerves size and

614
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,020
reach when inflammation occurs in the

615
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,679
brain stem that affects the vagus nerve

616
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,679
Grapevine

617
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,600
the vagus nerves can exhibit a wider

618
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,120
range of symptoms on the whole than

619
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,720
other cranial nerves so what this is is

620
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,340
this is a medical textbook right and I'm

621
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,159
just a human being like everybody else

622
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,380
I'm not a doctor

623
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,360
but I have to take the information word

624
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,280
for word doesn't matter how complicated

625
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,840
it is it doesn't matter

626
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,460
how it works I have to take a word from

627
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,780
a word from above to get it in here and

628
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,240
then I have to learn it just like

629
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,799
everybody else someone made fun of me

630
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,419
a couple weeks ago and it was a couple

631
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,799
weeks ago or a few weeks ago I saw it on

632
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,480
social media and they made fun of me and

633
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,159
they said the guy doesn't even know his

634
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,860
own information are you kidding this

635
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,500
eight eight huge medical books with

636
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,820
complicated detailed information I'm

637
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,860
only human

638
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,720
I have to learn it like everybody else

639
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,520
who gets the book If you go to the

640
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,780
library or buy the book somewhere and

641
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,159
get the book from the library and you

642
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,620
have the book in your hand you have to

643
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,659
learn this information I had to learn it

644
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,159
writing it down I still have to learn it

645
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,000
every day someone was making fun of me

646
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,000
like

647
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,380
he doesn't even know his information

648
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,779
when he reads it you should see it's

649
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,140
like are you kidding me

650
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:33,840
eight volumes of medical medical books

651
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,340
and detailed information yeah I have to

652
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,960
study it

653
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,960
yeah I have to read it

654
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,419
brain saver and brain saver Protocols

655
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,880
are two huge books they were written as

656
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,159
one book Health authors do not do that

657
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,100
they were released at the same time and

658
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,000
written over a year ago

659
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,100
okay mostly written in one year

660
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,679
basically and we had to split it in half

661
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,539
because the publisher said there's no

662
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
way to put anything out like this so I'm

663
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,500
just saying

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,120
right

665
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,260
you guys were talking about Vegas serves

666
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,059
let's get back to that and I want to

667
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,059
make this nerve good acid stabilizer

668
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,279
when inflammation occurs in the brain

669
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,279
stem

670
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
then we get in trouble if somebody has

671
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,340
brain stem inflammation it can affect

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,860
the vagus nerves or one of the vagus

673
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,860
nerves in a different way than just if

674
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,679
the vagus nerve itself was inflamed a

675
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,080
lot of people have brain stem vagus

676
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,539
nerve inflammation you don't hear that

677
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,279
out there anywhere but it's but it's

678
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,039
incredible when you think about this

679
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,380
information these Vegas nerve symptoms

680
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,679
okay

681
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,380
can result from an inflamed brain stem

682
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,299
and that could be like not just

683
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,620
tightness of the chest

684
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,659
not just a gut pain or spasm

685
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,720
but you can have like or you feel like

686
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:09,059
you can't even breathe you can't swallow

687
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,700
you're getting ticks and spasms

688
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,520
everywhere I mean you can have

689
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,440
brain stem

690
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,440
vagus nerves inflammation

691
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,159
these vagus nerve symptoms that result

692
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,720
from an inflamed brain stem could

693
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,279
include tightness of the chest tightness

694
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,860
of the throat mild dizziness and

695
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,080
imbalance to feeling an imbalanced

696
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,500
feeling like you know like you're on a

697
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,080
boat that whole thing

698
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,779
vagus nerve inflammation closer to the

699
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,539
brain stem giving you that boat feeling

700
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,279
that vertigo feeling as well as anxiety

701
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,440
pressure in the chest do you ever feel

702
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,960
you get pressure in the chest difficulty

703
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,120
swallowing even if mild a hard time

704
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
taking a deep breath can't keep a deep

705
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,580
breath can't get a deep breath

706
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,620
pain in the throat nausea and sometimes

707
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,240
erratic heartbeat where the doctor

708
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,919
checks out fine you wore the heart

709
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,000
monitor and the doctor checks out fine

710
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,039
if you guys just got here we're talking

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
about Vegas and you've got the heartbeat

712
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,000
erratic heartbeat

713
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,700
foreign

714
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,659
is stemming from higher up like this

715
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,600
ready higher up in the brain stem when

716
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,600
when vagus nerve inflammation

717
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,500
Tire up

718
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,500
in the brain stem

719
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,240
we could have a lot of symptoms mukto

720
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,520
says show please where are the two vagus

721
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,320
nerves they come right out of brain stem

722
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,059
the brain stems back here in this little

723
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,559
brain right here

724
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:49,260
and down in here and down in here

725
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,900
so it's and what they do is they come

726
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,020
out of the brain stem

727
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,880
right the cranial nerves come out

728
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,400
and they ride down

729
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,260
and they cross and I want to read about

730
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,260
that because it's really incredible

731
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,880
your vagus nerves

732
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,600
have a lot of little nerves that reach

733
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,159
out and attach to areas

734
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,919
intestinal tract

735
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,960
the gut stomach

736
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,520
a lot of people lose peristaltic action

737
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,020
they get gastroparesis because their

738
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,020
vagus nerve is paralyzed

739
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,440
you can have mild dizziness imbalance

740
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,960
feeling a sense of not digesting well

741
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,600
anxiety pressure in the chest difficulty

742
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,399
swallowing even if mild a hard time

743
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,500
taking a deep breath pain in the throat

744
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,679
nausea and sometimes erratic heartbeat

745
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,200
when vagus nerve inflammation is

746
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,659
stemming from higher up like this higher

747
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,940
up it's not stemming from here it's

748
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,220
stemming from up here okay in your brain

749
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,140
stem from the brain stem itself it could

750
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,760
be a little bit of everything there's

751
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,380
people that have a little bit of

752
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,840
everything and they're like why do I

753
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,460
have every symptom there's people that

754
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,779
feel like they have a hundred symptoms

755
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,779
to the do you have 100 symptoms

756
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,380

one possible experience is neurological

775
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,960
asthma so I want to talk about that a

776
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,000
little bit there's there's a difference

777
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,799
between your bronchial

778
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,799
tubes being inflamed

779
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,760
there's a difference between your

780
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,580
bronchial Airway being inflamed

781
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,200
versus

782
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,039
neurological asthma

783
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
um

784
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,820
I can't tell you over the years how many

785
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,799
times I've seen pulmonologists totally

786
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,860
confused by this

787
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,740
the person's doing a pulmonary test

788
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,440
they're breathing in the pipe

789
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,659
and then the pulmonologist says wait a

790
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,520
minute you don't have asthma but you

791
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,899
you're acting like you have asthma

792
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,260
you're acting like you have a breathing

793
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,260
problem

794
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,760
in a pulmonologist

795
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,399
doesn't know what to do

796
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,899
so they give you all the steroids

797
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,580
they give you all the medications they

798
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,860
give you the albuterol they give you all

799
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,960
of that and they're hoping that it helps

800
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:51,000
but yet your bronchial Airways are not

801
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:55,460
constricted there isn't an actual

802
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,460
blockage from them swelling

803
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,120
so then where do we go what do we do

804
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,820
millions of people on this planet I've

805
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,760
seen so many that have had neurological

806
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,640
asthma which is a term a medical medium

807
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,419
term nobody knew that that existed like

808
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,760
that

809
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:14,520
so a possible experience is neurological

810
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,640
asthma ready a form of asthma where the

811
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,860
Airways are not impeded by visible

812
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,220
inflammation at the pulmonologist's

813
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,860
office instead neurological asthma is

814
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,919
the sensation of air restriction created

815
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:33,980
by inflamed vagus nerves it's the

816
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,980
sensation of Airway obstruction

817
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,419
Elvis lives said this is perfectly

818
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,760
explaining the difficulties I've been

819
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,100
having for the last 20 years never heard

820
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,960
anything that so perfectly describes all

821
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,179
of it it's very emotional incredible

822
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,580
Elvis lives I'm honored you're here

823
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,460
that's why I

824
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,220
try to help and get this information out

825
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,220
I pray to God every night

826
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,820
that someone finds their way and they

827
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,820
find this information

828
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,620
gets me emotional

829
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,880
Shake It Off Shake It Off

830
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,440
get reading get reading

831
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,440
Spirit of compassion said keep reading

832
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,000
we got work to do

833
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,000
okay

834
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:34,200
and by the way we understand

835
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,460
your pain with all of that

836
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,019
so what I was talking about the

837
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,340
neurological asthma which is a big deal

838
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,779
and I want you to know this and I've

839
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,820
taught doctors about this throughout the

840
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:43,500
years when this when the bronchial tubes

841
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,539
are not obstructed whatsoever on any

842
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,159
level they're not inflamed where there's

843
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:49,440
an actual obstruction and they can't get

844
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,360
the ear in instead they have a

845
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,860
neurological problem the vagus nerves

846
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,659
are inflamed and when the vagus nerves

847
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,419
are inflamed they're getting a slight

848
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:59,580
sensation of paralysis that doesn't even

849
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,500
feel like air is even going in so you're

850
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,299
stuck you just don't know what to do and

851
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,640
then you get anxiety attacks and then

852
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,440
you hyperventilate that's neurological

853
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,000
asthma and you can go to a whole bunch

854
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,260
of pulmonologists they don't know what's

855
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,700
wrong and then you're back to another

856
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,899
neurologist and everybody else and

857
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,639
they're just like I don't know what to

858
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,080
tell you I think you have anxiety maybe

859
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,480
you should take some Xanax and that's

860
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,179
what they tell people where benzo or

861
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,359
some other benzo or something

862
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,359
foreign

863
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:29,300
as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the

864
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,099
brain stem whoa what did I just said say

865
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,139
as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the

866
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,820
burning stem

867
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,060
in

868
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:41,820
oh yeah yep for mild to more severe some

869
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,040
of the inflammation will lessen or

870
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,359
intensify on the vagus dirt Grapevine so

871
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,800
this is what's really interesting right

872
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,419
here

873
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,460
because I'm having a conversation with

874
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,740
SOC at the same time I'm trying to read

875
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,300
comments and and be present for you guys

876
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,060
at the same time I'm trying to read this

877
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,160
this complexity

878
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,380
this medical Bible right here

879
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,760
Susan horn says I feel like crying too

880
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,760
finally I got answers

881
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,839
we should all cry together I want to sit

882
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,339
down and all this cry together life

883
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,720
coaching nurse Kim says tears of

884
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,720
gratitude right now thank you aw

885
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,160
so as this inflammation I'm talking

886
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,140
about Ebbs and flows in the brain stem

887
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,839
which I was saying before like the brain

888
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,760
stem right from mild to more severe for

889
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,500
some people some of the inflammation

890
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,420
will lessen or intensify on the Vegas

891
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,359
nerve Grapevine what I'm trying to say

892
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,820
is the Grapevine the vagus nerves that

893
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,280
run through the body okay that might

894
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,079
less

895
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,099
intensify so your symptoms can change

896
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,500
down here sometimes but yet up here you

897
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,160
can have more intense symptoms when it

898
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,599
comes down to Vegas Stars

899
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,760
inflammation can come and go based on

900
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,619
whether someone is getting more sleep or

901
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,320
is lacking sleep do you know that now

902
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:01,940
listen listen

903
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,940
I know I hit a chord

904
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,220
if you can't sleep good it's okay

905
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,380
so I'm going to tell you something I

906
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,380
talk about it in

907
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,119
protocols

908
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,579
there's a piece of information in here

909
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,200
that's so powerful in the protocols book

910
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:21,480
it's a technique

911
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,640
it's absolutely just profound and

912
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,660
mind-blowing it's about resting the

913
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,800
nerves

914
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,540
okay

915
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,520
and

916
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,800
you can rest the nerves even if you're

917
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,060
not sleeping and have those nerves

918
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,619
heal

919
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,119
even when you're not sleeping so I don't

920
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,320
want anybody upset if they don't sleep

921
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,720
good

922
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,640
Michelle L says all I do is sleep

923
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,380
that's a good thing

924
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,380
meaning like if your true body's trying

925
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,700
to heal and it's allowing you to sleep

926
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,700
that's amazing

927
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,180
as inflammation Ebbs and flows us

928
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:57,180
talking about the Grapevine can shift on

929
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,579
symptoms so if someone is lacking sleep

930
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,220
or getting more sleep it can shift the

931
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,900
symptoms they can so if someone's

932
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,160
sleeping more symptoms can shift if

933
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,500
someone's not sleeping as much as

934
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,880
symptoms can shift because when you

935
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,680
sleep your body is trying to heal

936
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,940
inflamed nerves and your immune system

937
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,380
is going after bugs

938
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,079
inflamed vagus nerves

939
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,859
big part of that are pathogens like

940
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,380
Epstein-Barr right these pathogens

941
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,300
are in are releasing poisons and toxins

942
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,099
and it's inflaming our brain stem and

943
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,520
vagus nerves our immune system is trying

944
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,579
to clean up the pathogens so when we

945
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,560
sleep our symptoms can lessen in many

946
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,660
situations because pathogens are trying

947
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,460
to do their job while you're sleeping if

948
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,339
you can't sleep you can still heal

949
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,660
nerves and get through it I've talked

950
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,660
about that in the books

951
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,760
other factors that affect inflammation

952
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,260
include whether someone is less stressed

953
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,000
or more stressed whether someone is

954
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,800
eating better than normal or a little

955
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,780
bit of out of control with their foods

956
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,480
and whether someone is exercising more

957
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,099
or less these changes matter

958
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,740
you do

959
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,960
on a day with lower inflammation you may

960
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,720
still have the tightness of the chest

961
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,140
yet less pressure or pain in the abdomen

962
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,140
region

963
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,859
so one day

964
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,020
you're like why am I less pressure on

965
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:24,599
the chest but more tightness on the

966
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:28,040
abdomen like why is that happening why

967
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,040
am I less pressure somewhere

968
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,119
and then less anxiety and then sometimes

969
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,280
worse anxiety less vertigo and more

970
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,260
vertigo and some days balance issues or

971
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,780
dizziness if the brain stem inflammation

972
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,640
becomes more pronounced it can feel more

973
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,339
drastic with all of the symptoms

974
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,119
combined at an advanced level

975
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:53,280
so when the brain stem is inflamed all

976
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,839
of these symptoms can feel really really

977
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,520
intense

978
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,440
I mean there's so many of you guys that

979
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,359
had like a hundred symptoms and you're

980
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,320
knocking those symptoms down as you're

981
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:05,820
using medical medium information

982
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,500
viral inflammation combined with toxic

983
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,760
heavy metals and everyday toxic

984
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,619
chemicals

985
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,480
that are inside the brain stem located

986
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,520
close to the vagus nerves there can

987
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,160
create most every vagus nerve symptom

988
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,660
with different variables and to

989
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,760
different degrees at the same time so

990
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,380
when people have low-grade viral

991
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:28,079
infections and I'm on page 103 right now

992
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,079
low-grade viral infections and lots of

993
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,240
metals and toxins that can have vagus

994
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,920
inflammation in various areas of the

995
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,300
nerves from the brain stem down to their

996
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,339
gut

997
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:43,500
so I'm in brain saver by the way Page

998
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:44,940
105 103 sorry in brain saver

999
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,339
you guys we're going to be making the

1000
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,200
nerve acid gut stabilizer I am pumped up

1001
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:51,780
about that but I'm just reading about

1002
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,400
some Vegas nervement the vagus nerves

1003
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,400
inflammation talk

1004
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,160
in many cases of brain stem and cranial

1005
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,859
nerve inflammation the infection is not

1006
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,839
in the brain stem or nerves themselves

1007
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,359
doesn't mean you have the Epstein-Barr

1008
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,820
virus in your brain stem

1009
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,859
the viral infection such as such as

1010
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,200
Epstein-Barr or shingles herpes simplex

1011
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:19,260
1 or Herpes Simplex 2 is inside the

1012
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,599
liver or inside the spleen

1013
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,180
wherever a viral infection is in the

1014
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,160
body if it's releasing viral neurotoxins

1015
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,200
those neurotoxins can travel through the

1016
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,500
bloodstream and land on your vagus

1017
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,599
nerves and inflame them in all kinds of

1018
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,859
whack-a-doodle places

1019
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,560
making the Vegas their Grapevine

1020
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:43,079
inflamed creating additional symptoms

1021
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
whenever neurotoxins inflamabagus nerves

1022
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,599
I want to talk about that what's a

1023
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,599
neurotoxin you guys know medical medium

1024
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,119
byproduct released from a virus like

1025
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,940
Epstein-Barr

1026
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,000
and that byproduct is neurotoxic it's

1027
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,800
it's an allergen to a vagus nerve

1028
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,859
cranial nerve trigeminal neurofascial

1029
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,859
nerve hypoglossal nerve right

1030
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,200
wherever neurotoxins inflamabase nerve

1031
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,240
they create inflammation a hot spot

1032
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,859
so a hot spot

1033
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,260
gotta think about this you got your

1034
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,880
vagus nerve and in that Vegas they're on

1035
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,300
that Vegas nerve there's going to be hot

1036
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,400
spots most people walking around sick

1037
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,180
and visiting their doctor's offices have

1038
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,660
these hot spots on their vagus nerves

1039
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,820
hot spots or are inflamed areas of your

1040
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,500
vagus nerves guys I'm reading on a brain

1041
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,560
saver you guys don't have these books

1042
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,640
saw somebody say what book is that you

1043
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,640
want to get these books

1044
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,540
G2 Vision says you saved me I'm so

1045
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:54,900
familiar with all of these symptoms I

1046
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,320
had lots and I have I had a loss and

1047
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,320
stress

1048
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:05,040
before ended up with spasms and crazy

1049
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,740
heartbeat I got on the protocols for the

1050
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,200
vagus nerves symptoms gone

1051
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,280
hearts and praying hands

1052
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,280
I was on IG

1053
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,700
some of these hot spots

1054
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,700
that's incredible by the way

1055
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,079
if a virus attaches itself to a higher

1056
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:27,000
section of events so first of all I want

1057
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,700
to say something

1058
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,820
foreign

1059
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm proud of you

1060
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,839
because it takes it it takes a certain

1061
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,839
person

1062
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,420
to know what this is

1063
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:44,940
okay

1064
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,520
it takes a certain person to know what

1065
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,940
the heck this whole medical medium thing

1066
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,940
is

1067
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,720
takes a rare person to know what all of

1068
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,720
this is

1069
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,839
like the books the information from

1070
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,700
above

1071
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,480
the protocols

1072
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,480
the mission

1073
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,619
this whole thing is a mission

1074
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,440
to help the chronically ill heal

1075
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,660
it takes a special person to understand

1076
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,260
that

1077
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,260
push through

1078
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,579
and try to do this with all the Flack

1079
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,480
they get in this stupid that they

1080
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,480
get for doing it

1081
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,859
and for all the naysayers and bullies

1082
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,200
and discriminators out there

1083
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:41,060
it takes a certain person to know what

1084
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,060
all this is that we're doing

1085
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:50,119
Gabriella says my inflammation has

1086
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,119
reduced after the light blast

1087
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,839
that's music to my ears

1088
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,800
if a vagus nerve attached if sorry if a

1089
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,020
virus attaches itself to a higher

1090
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
section of a vagus nerve someone could

1091
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,800
experience a severe bad vertigo where

1092
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,020
they feel stuck

1093
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,359
if you ever had that vertigo where

1094
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,160
you're barfing in a bucket and your head

1095
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,500
is spinning around and you're laying in

1096
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,240
bed and your head's doing this

1097
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,460
like feeling like it's doing this like

1098
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,020
you're laying in bed and your head feels

1099
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,180
it's going like this

1100
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,859
I'm talking like the vertigo the crazy

1101
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,540
vertigo right

1102
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:33,180
if you ever had that kind of vertigo

1103
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,060
that's when that's not a neurotoxin

1104
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,220
anymore coming from Epstein-Barr that's

1105
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,520
not a Epstein-Barr neurotoxin anymore

1106
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:44,839
giving you a hot spot on your ve on your

1107
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,880
vagus nerves or vagus nerve

1108
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:52,020
that's the Epstein-Barr virus attaching

1109
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,460
itself to your vagus nerve up high near

1110
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,380
the brain stem

1111
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,560
so if you had that vertigo where you're

1112
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,000
like holy crap and it's just doing this

1113
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,040
and you feel like your head's doing this

1114
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,380
and you're like oh my God and you're

1115
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:07,319
laying in bed and you're in in torture

1116
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,900
land with that vertigo

1117
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,079
that's the V that's the Epstein-Barr

1118
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,480
virus attaching itself to the vagus

1119
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,319
nerve that's not a hot spot anymore from

1120
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,319
neurotoxins

1121
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,680
by the way we're day three of the

1122
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,480
medical medium brain shot therapy

1123
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,400
cleanse challenge we're doing 20 days

1124
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,920
we're doing the nerve gut acid

1125
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,660
stabilizer in a little bit we got our

1126
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,859
stuff in front of us

1127
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,859
okay let's get back to business

1128
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,740
the vagus nerves are channels for

1129
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,900
information delivery to the lungs heart

1130
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,700
stomach and intestinal tract your Vegas

1131
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,020
nerves what are they their channels for

1132
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,020
in information

1133
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,579
in formation

1134
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,180
Elvis lives

1135
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,980
Anthony Dot

1136
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,079
could emotional trauma be one of the

1137
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,880
causes of Vegas nerve inflammation and

1138
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:04,560
could it be stored there for years and

1139
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
years with the trauma constantly

1140
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,420
attempting to release itself the problem

1141
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,640
is with trauma is it it lowers our

1142
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,740
immune system

1143
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,980
trauma

1144
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,480
crashes our adrenals and our immune

1145
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,040
system

1146
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,520
and then

1147
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,440
viruses that were dormant

1148
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,400
have a field day

1149
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,200
that's mostly I'm not saying trauma

1150
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,300
can't

1151
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,760
give you PTSD and all kinds of other

1152
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,920
injuries in the soul and in the physical

1153
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,319
brain I talk about how trauma can create

1154
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,300
physical brain injuries in your neurons

1155
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,339
and I talk about it in detail and brain

1156
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,099
saver Elvis lives you have to read the

1157
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:51,680
emotional brain chapter please it's so

1158
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,680
in depth it's so adapted that at all

1159
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,920
the vagus nerve the Vegas nerves are

1160
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:02,099
channels for information hey smoking

1161
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,480
Paradise and that information travels

1162
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,460
through the

1163
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,859
vagus nerves but the cause of Vegas

1164
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,040
nerve inflammation is viral and toxic

1165
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:12,599
heavy metals and toxins it's that's what

1166
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,420
it is

1167
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,680
okay I talk about this also invite

1168
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,020
what's incredible about this book

1169
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,760
there's a section a chapter called viral

1170
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,180
brain and then a chapter called

1171
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,180
emotional brain you'll see where

1172
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,520
traumatic loss in everything can injure

1173
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,280
the brain yes and I talk about that but

1174
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,500
you can see where how it does it and

1175
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,500
then how other things injure the brain

1176
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,099
when our brain's neurons get

1177
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,160
contaminated with toxic heavy metals

1178
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:46,380
caffeine MSG petrochemicals chemical

1179
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,960
fragrances viral neurotoxins or other

1180
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,940
brain betrayers they can disrupt this

1181
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,099
flow of information so what I'm trying

1182
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,660
to say is information is going through

1183
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,300
your vagus nerve and traveling through

1184
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:02,780
but if there's enough going on it can

1185
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,780
disrupt this traveling of information

1186
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:07,020
that that is contaminants interfere with

1187
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,319
the signals that neurons send down to

1188
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,940
the brain stem

1189
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:14,520
neurons are sending signals down through

1190
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,500
the brain stem down out of your vagus

1191
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,480
nerves

1192
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,359
which in turn affects the signals that

1193
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,280
cranial nerves such as the vagus nerve

1194
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:25,020
are meant to deliver on rare occasions

1195
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,880
brain tissue becomes inflamed from

1196
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,339
direct viral infection like I talked

1197
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,720
about and this can interfere with neuron

1198
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,060
messaging too so what I'm trying to say

1199
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,339
is your neurons have information in it

1200
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,980
and then that information goes out of

1201
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:40,500
the brain stem and goes

1202
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,660
out of the cranial nerves like the vagus

1203
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,400
nerves

1204
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:49,200
D on YouTube this is answering question

1205
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,579
I have about my son the things you

1206
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,579
describe are amazing

1207
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,520
when contaminated messaging travels from

1208
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,780
the neurons down to the vagus nerves to

1209
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,940
the organs such as the heart and

1210
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,680
intestinal tract it's a skewed erratic

1211
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,900
electrical signal with skewed

1212
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,119
information okay you guys hear what I'm

1213
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,680
going now do you hear hear what I'm

1214
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,119
going on this check this out

1215
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,800
that piece of information alone blew my

1216
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,300
mind when I had to

1217
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,280
um transcribe it

1218
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:23,060
we're in spirit of compassion and get it

1219
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,060
in the books right

1220
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,319
when contaminated messaging travels from

1221
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,680
the neurons you got contaminated

1222
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:33,480
messaging MSG heavy metals fragrances

1223
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,880
chemicals from chemical companies all

1224
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,380
that stuff drugs whatever

1225
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,260
Pharmaceuticals all that stuff is inside

1226
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:43,140
the brain right the messaging from those

1227
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:45,300
neurons can become skewed

1228
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,740
and that messaging

1229
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,740
can become erratic

1230
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,760
it's a skewed erratic electrical signal

1231
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,960
with skewed information all because the

1232
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,420
neurons from which the information

1233
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,220
originated were contaminated

1234
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,160
this is how someone can have an

1235
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,839
electrical heartbeat issue without any

1236
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,140
impeding or obstruction issue okay so

1237
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:13,339
here's how it works someone can have no

1238
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,339
problems with their heart

1239
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:20,700
they've been to so many cardiologists

1240
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,500
and they have had no problems with their

1241
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:26,040
heart

1242
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,940
their valves are good their ventricles

1243
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,940
are good

1244
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,300
they're not having bleeding in their

1245
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:36,000
ventricles

1246
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,280
they don't have a blockage in their mic

1247
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,460
their small blood vessels and arteries

1248
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,000
in their heart the heart is checking out

1249
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,000
fine

1250
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,880
the doctors like you don't have a heart

1251
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,880
problem

1252
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,800
foreign

1253
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,300
but listen it's an it's a skewed erratic

1254
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,400
electrical signal with skewed

1255
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,020
information all because the neurons from

1256
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,359
which the information originated inside

1257
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:11,880
the brain were contaminated this is how

1258
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,000
someone can have an electrical heartbeat

1259
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,700
issue without anything impeding or

1260
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,740
obstructing a heart valve or having any

1261
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,599
other heart problem ventricle issue or

1262
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,700
other issues with the heart

1263
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,319
Soul Angel says thank you for all these

1264
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,780
life-saving tools it's been a full

1265
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:30,480
blessing to me and my autistic twins

1266
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:34,200
recently diagnosed with celiac disease

1267
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,119
they love the HM detox smoothie have

1268
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,359
metal detox smoothie your life saving

1269
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,619
thank you for being here Soul angel

1270
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,300
foreign

1271
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,800
so there's a whole bunch of people

1272
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,059
walking around with monitors but they

1273
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,099
don't have a heart problem they're told

1274
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:49,280
maybe it's tachycardia maybe it's afib

1275
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,839
it's aphid it's tachycardia yeah

1276
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,640
electrical

1277
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:55,559
electrical signals that are actually

1278
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,240
skewed but here's the thing medical

1279
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,280
research and science don't know that the

1280
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,900
reason why the electrical signals are

1281
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,700
skewed coming from neurons in the brain

1282
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,500
is because of some kind of contamination

1283
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,480
issue in the brain but they don't know

1284
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,839
that

1285
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,839
Advanced information

1286
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,920
another way an electrical heartbeat

1287
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,800
issue can occur is if the brain stem is

1288
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,540
inflamed where the vagus nerves exit

1289
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,460
if you have inflammation where those

1290
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,920
vagus nerves exit out of your brain stem

1291
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,619
boom you're hurting too

1292
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,260
Danielle Mangini says wow amazing that's

1293
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:33,000
what I have low voltage in one chamber

1294
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,380
will the low volt that's how it works

1295
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,660
low voltage I've heard this a billion

1296
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,980
times too well I'm exaggerating it's not

1297
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,319
a billion times

1298
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,660
but I've heard it I mean thousands and

1299
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,579
thousands of times over the years right

1300
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,200
that

1301
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,640
um that that low voltage should have

1302
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,800
heard that it's like why is that

1303
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,079
happening

1304
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,240
contamination inside the brain I've told

1305
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,660
lots of doctors that bring the books to

1306
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,660
your doctors

1307
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:00,900
Bode Katrin says the chapter on

1308
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,980
emotional brain is so mind-blowing

1309
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,140
honestly

1310
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,599
every time I read the chapter on

1311
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,940
emotional brain inside brain saver my

1312
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,980
mind is blown over and over and over

1313
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,339
again I'm surprised I even have a mind

1314
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,980
left it's been blown too many times

1315
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:19,319
and not by psilocybins

1316
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,480
and Ayahuasca or anything because I've

1317
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,000
never done anything like that or weed I

1318
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,940
don't smoke weed never did Kimberly all

1319
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
good I'm not judging anybody who has

1320
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:32,400
at all I'm just saying I don't Kimberly

1321
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,500
all good I had heart palpitations and

1322
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,819
drinking celery juice every day stopped

1323
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,920
that issue

1324
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:42,140
amazing you got all those electrolytes

1325
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,140
sodium cluster salts to your brain

1326
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:50,280
guys where am I I'm lost I'm lost in the

1327
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,059
chapter now I don't even know where I am

1328
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,380
messaging from neurons in the brain gets

1329
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:57,240
momentarily blocked in the brain stem

1330
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,859
builds up and then exits with high

1331
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,079
intensities sending signals down the

1332
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:03,119
vagus nerves that hit the heart oh whoa

1333
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,980
which can cause heart palpitations and

1334
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,900
spasms in other places this is insane

1335
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,420
this piece of information is absolutely

1336
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:13,400
unbelievable

1337
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,400
what this book is saying

1338
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,460
yes Spirit of compassion what you're

1339
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,780
saying

1340
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,859
is

1341
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:25,680
that mess what happens is an electrical

1342
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:27,960
electricity can get stuck

1343
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,540
in the brain stem

1344
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,700
if the vagus nerves right on the coming

1345
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,520
right out of the brain stem are inflamed

1346
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:38,579
electricity could get stuck and then it

1347
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,140
can get released in a bigger pal and

1348
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,140
when it's released in a bigger pout

1349
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:47,819
it can intensify sending signals down to

1350
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:49,920
the vagus nerves that hit the heart

1351
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:52,079
which can cause heart palpitations and

1352
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,420
spasms in other places that are unknown

1353
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,160
to why it's happening why am I getting

1354
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,260
heart palpitations when my heart is

1355
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,839
checking out fine it's because you're

1356
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,059
getting this electrical shot that's

1357
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:05,280
coming out of your brain stem

1358
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:08,180
and running to your heart and hitting it

1359
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,180
faster and harder

1360
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,980
it's a shock to the heart

1361
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,760
my God this book is packed

1362
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,260
this is

1363
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,480
Sarah

1364
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,859
feinstra says you said it takes a

1365
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,720
special person to accept this

1366
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:29,900
information

1367
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,579
does Darkness attack us

1368
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:35,700
strategically or is it random does

1369
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:37,800
Darkness know our potential more than we

1370
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,319
even we do

1371
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,380
I'll do a big talk about that maybe I'll

1372
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,839
do like I'll do a separate show on that

1373
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,000
after we get through

1374
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:50,280
the incredible 20-day brain shot that

1375
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,099
everyone's Challenge and then we'll talk

1376
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,319
about that I do know this

1377
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,020
darkness in the world does not want this

1378
00:55:55,319 --> 00:56:01,020
information out does not want

1379
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:04,500
you know credibility to this information

1380
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:06,420
does not just wants people on

1381
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,359
toxic crap

1382
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:13,260
and you know and not having answers I

1383
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:15,839
mean it's no it's no mystery that the

1384
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,540
industries want people in the dark

1385
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,119
me media only says bad things about me

1386
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,520
and remember this remember this okay

1387
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:27,240
anybody who's here right now

1388
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,240
like media

1389
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:34,260
most most of the time always just send

1390
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:38,280
says it says crap about me and

1391
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,440
you know because it's like it's like

1392
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,780
it's like smear campaigns and stuff like

1393
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,400
that and hit pieces like constantly I

1394
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,240
mean that's what it's always been it's

1395
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,240
like

1396
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,880
because it's like they don't want people

1397
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,980
getting this incredible information

1398
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,180
so the lie because that's what maybe is

1399
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,859
allowed to do they're allowed to lie by

1400
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,880
the way I don't know if you guys knew

1401
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,980
that but they're allowed to just say

1402
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,500
anything they want right

1403
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,119
and

1404
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,339
you'll never see media share all your

1405
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,500
unbelievable healing stories that are

1406
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,420
mind-blowing

1407
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,119
that would literally

1408
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,260
each one of your healing stories should

1409
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,260
make People magazine

1410
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,800
that incredible each one of your healing

1411
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,079
stories should make Time Magazine

1412
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,559
that's how unbelievable your healing

1413
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,559
stories are

1414
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:29,180
you know and and the media won't share

1415
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,980
like healing stories like that because

1416
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:34,140
you know and the media won't share the

1417
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,800
fact that science is taking the medical

1418
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,800
medium information

1419
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:43,280
is that unbelievable

1420
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,280
but that's how this world works

1421
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:48,059
and said they'll write a smear campaign

1422
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,700
instead of like showcasing

1423
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:54,480
like I gotta tell you something right

1424
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:57,540
a famous TV show but but also to the

1425
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,099
credit of like TV Land and stuff I mean

1426
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,200
I am offered

1427
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:02,819
the medical medium like TV series and

1428
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,839
stuff like that but I don't want to I

1429
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:06,480
don't want to do that I don't want to

1430
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,000
cookie cut and make it all about me

1431
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,020
and then not do the work I I've I've

1432
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,079
been

1433
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,780
um chosen to do right

1434
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:19,260
but what's interesting is like a really

1435
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,960
well-known show TV show

1436
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:25,579
having a tech problem on tick I think a

1437
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,579
really well-known TV show

1438
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,079
asked me to come on

1439
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,859
to talk about medical stuff

1440
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,859
and

1441
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:41,460
so and they said well you can bring

1442
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:44,040
a healing story a person on there that

1443
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,720
healed or multiple people that healed

1444
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,859
with medical meme information I was like

1445
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,700
you know what

1446
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:49,700
that's incredible

1447
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,720
so

1448
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,200
the TV show reached out to a whole bunch

1449
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,299
of people like 10 people

1450
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,460
to say hey do you want to come on the

1451
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:04,079
show

1452
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,040
to be there and have the medical medium

1453
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,260
in you

1454
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,460
talk about your sickness and what you've

1455
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,900
been through and how you healed this

1456
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,059
miraculous story that you have like how

1457
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,940

1458
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:18,180
and and stories like that and so

1459
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:20,220
people said I would love to

1460
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,900
so then it got close to airing the

1461
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,480
to filming the show

1462
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,900
it got close to filming the show on a

1463
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,900
major Network

1464
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,900
and when we got close to filming the

1465
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:32,700
show The Producers then reached out to

1466
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,140

I said why

00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,740
and they said the producer said the head

1478
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,299
producer said

1479
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:03,000
we just thought it wouldn't be a good

1480
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:04,680
idea having those 10 individuals on who

1481
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,480
got out of wheelchairs who got who

1482
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,579
healed and everything else we just don't

1483
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,579
think it would be a great idea

1484
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:19,640
and he said but we'll see we'll see you

1485
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,640
in an hour I said you and I hung up

1486
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,180
all right let's keep on going

1487
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,299
all right let's go

1488
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:33,500
so on that note

1489
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:33,500
is that an unbelievable story

1490
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,180
it's like what

1491
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,140
because I I felt so bad because people

1492
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:45,299
were called

1493
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,740
and they're all excited from what the

1494
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,180
producer said they were going to talk

1495
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,799
about their incredible healing stories

1496
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,079
about how that got out of wheelchairs

1497
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:54,000
two people were got out of wheelchairs

1498
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,859
two of them out of the ten

1499
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,160
the other eight

1500
01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:00,359
one person right one person is a cancer

1501
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,319
survivor

1502
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:07,140
using mm info another person

1503
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,299
um the other person was had ALS

1504
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,640
and then got better and another percent

1505
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:14,280
Alzheimer's and got better

1506
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,260
and there were a few others and they

1507
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,299
didn't they didn't what happened was I

1508
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,760
think the the producers

1509
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:22,200
we're like holy crap we're gonna put

1510
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,540
somebody on that got better from

1511
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,700
Alzheimer's we're gonna put somebody on

1512
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,880
that he knew 20 years ago that got

1513
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,619
better from ALS and they were they like

1514
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,960
and they're still here and they're fine

1515
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:35,819
like they were actually like their minds

1516
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,339
were blown

1517
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:40,260
and they had it all scheduled

1518
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:42,839

the crap out of the juice people are

1578
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,599
asking me all the time and I can't

1579
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,819

1580
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,980
a thousand DMS on what's the best juicer

1581
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:52,680
I just can't do it right

1582
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,960
so I try to talk about it when I'm using

1583
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,480
the juicer

1584
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,339
anyway I'm gonna okay first of all let's

1585
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,960
talk about the nerve the nerve that acid

1586
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:03,180
stabilizer let's talk about that one a

1587
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,859
little bit okay

1588
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,599
when I see another comment first of all

1589
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:09,000
when I see another comment say say after

1590
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,220
the sales over for the mm 1500 900 I see

1591
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,980
a comment saying what's the best juicer

1592
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:16,380
in the sales over I want to cry

1593
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:19,380
I want to cry and then if I don't talk

1594
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,299
about the juicer for like six months

1595
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:23,700
and I think everybody knows what juicer

1596
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:25,319
is the best they end up with a spinning

1597
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,180
baskets user or something else that they

1598
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,559
got sold into and they're buying they're

1599
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,780
spending dumping all their money into

1600
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,280
produce because it's not squeezing

1601
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,900
enough juice out and they're throwing

1602
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:37,079
money out the window

1603
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:39,720
it's insane right

1604
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,640
anyway here's the thing about the nerve

1605
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,900
gut acid stabilizer that's cilantro

1606
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,660
right here

1607
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:48,359
that's parsley this is curly parsley

1608
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:51,260
right here this is flat leaf parsley

1609
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,260
parsley right there

1610
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,260
so we have three different things here

1611
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,480
now here's the thing I'm not going to

1612
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,940
combine

1613
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,400
cilantro with parsley

1614
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:05,940
I'm not gonna mix them

1615
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,920
but you can do either a cilantro shot on

1616
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,640
its own as an option

1617
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,980
so many people

1618
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:17,040
love to hate cilantro

1619
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:20,059
they hate cilantro they love to hate

1620
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:23,700
cilantro right

1621
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:28,339
okay and then you can do parsley on its

1622
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:28,339
own too you can pick each one right

1623
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,000
you can pick each one

1624
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,500
keep that in mind

1625
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,359
you might be somebody that's high in

1626
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,299
toxic heavy metals

1627
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:42,500
and you're doing the cilantro nerve gut

1628
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:45,720
acid stabilizer

1629
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:49,319
but you can choose either or

1630
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:51,839
parsley one is knock your socks off like

1631
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:55,260
for real love so let's get started I'm

1632
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:57,180
gonna run some there through here okay

1633
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,160
high in toxic heavy metals don't like

1634
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,440
Taste of cilantro so what happens is

1635
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,020
people who are high in all those toxic

1636
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,460
heavy metals tend to not like the taste

1637
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,740
of cilantro

1638
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,599
where it it does something in their

1639
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:12,839
mouth it makes their mouth start doing

1640
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,599
some crazy stuff where they despise The

1641
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:18,720
Taste completely and then when you start

1642
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,700
getting Metals out over time or bursts

1643
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,440
of metals out in different areas of the

1644
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,680
organs as they're coming out over time

1645
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,900
it can waver where you actually can

1646
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,579
stand cilantro or you actually don't

1647
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,680
mind it or to the point where you

1648
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,619
actually love it anything can shift and

1649
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:38,579
grow and change

1650
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:41,700
we're doing though the parsley shot

1651
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:43,859
so I'm gonna run

1652
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,579
my parsley fruit

1653
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,579
right now

1654
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:56,160
I'm using flat leaf and a little curly

1655
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:57,839
but I'm gonna just go with more flat

1656
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,420
leaf

1657
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:01,559
I mean personally you can have either or

1658
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:05,280
okay

1659
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:07,460
but personally flat leaf parsley is my

1660
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,460
favorite

1661
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,819
foreign

1662
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:22,140
so

1663
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,160
these are really big parsley stems

1664
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,160
they're huge

1665
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:31,140
people are asking the difference between

1666
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,739
parsley and cilantro all the time I can

1667
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,739
tell you this

1668
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:38,580
okay

1669
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,020
what I recommend is don't always just do

1670
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,259
one

1671
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:45,359
forever you can

1672
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:48,000
but if it's everything I'm talking about

1673
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,040
with the nerve gut problems that people

1674
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,020
have

1675
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,580
that I read about in the book earlier

1676
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:00,140
switch off

1677
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:00,140
do the parsley shot

1678
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:04,920
do it for a while and then eventually do

1679
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,060
a cilantro shot

1680
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,060
for like a week

1681
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,400
so I'm putting this incredible parsley I

1682
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,279
get mesmerized by

1683
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,359
beautiful flat leaf parsley what about

1684
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,560
you guys

1685
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,560
sending it right through

1686
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,600
just that I don't usually have flat leaf

1687
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:34,279
parsley so but today I do so I actually

1688
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,279
really want to focus on that it's fun

1689
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:40,580
very fibrous

1690
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:40,580
extremely fibrous

1691
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:50,100
parsley juice almost becomes gelatinous

1692
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:51,900
it's the craziest thing

1693
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,620
so I'm gonna be honest I have enough for

1694
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,620
a shot I think

1695
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,880
I mean you almost can spoon

1696
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:08,179
that parsley juice out it's crazy how it

1697
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,179
works

1698
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:16,080
it's just crazy

1699
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,400
all right we got a parsley shot right

1700
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,739
here

1701
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,820
Lori asked how long will will the sale

1702
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:24,360
last

1703
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:26,040
It's Gonna Last to the end I think of

1704
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,840
the brain set challenge possibly maybe a

1705
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:32,100
little after I'm not sure

1706
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:35,880
Sarah how do I get one of those juicers

1707
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:37,440
in the information do you have

1708
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,179
to get one of these

1709
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,780
link is in profile link is in the

1710
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:45,300
description there's a medical medium

1711
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,380
customer service line at Omega by the

1712
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:50,100
way

1713
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:52,620
you can easily talk to them anytime

1714
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,480
by the way this mm-1500 I just want to

1715
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,340
say does a lot of stuff so it's the

1716
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,380
mm1500 is what you're looking at you're

1717
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:02,699
not looking at the 800s or anything else

1718
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:04,699
you're looking at the mm-1500 or mm-900

1719
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,699
um

1720
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:11,300
so I want to show you something okay

1721
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:13,860
this is dry

1722
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:16,320
this is actually dry

1723
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:20,400
is what this piece of rope is

1724
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,960
this thing was completely cold pressed

1725
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,900
masticated

1726
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:27,600
and it's it's dry right the mm 1500 900

1727
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:29,880
you'll buy less parsley you have food

1728
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,260
costs are going up you'll buy less

1729
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,960
parsley

1730
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,820
for your parsley shot there's no juice

1731
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,040
dripping off of this it's basically

1732
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:41,040
drying out like rapidly because it was

1733
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,320
so so dry right

1734
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,179
I mean it's a joke really the

1735
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,400
centrifugal juicers and the spinning

1736
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:49,500
basket juicers and all that it's it's

1737
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,320
all this juice comes out in the pulp

1738
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:56,280
it's wet and sloppy

1739
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,140
right so the juice comes out in the pulp

1740
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,540
you lose your juice it's like wet and

1741
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:02,580
sloppy it gets discarded people complain

1742
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,320
there's not enough juice

1743
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,719
so people who actually buy those other

1744
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,760
juicers like the like the spinning

1745
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,800
basket ones and the centrifuge ones

1746
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,760
where it's easier to use it you know

1747
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,500
because you're just shoving everything

1748
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,380
in the reason why it's easier to use

1749
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:18,600
that way is because it's not juicing all

1750
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:21,360
the juice out it's just spitting it all

1751
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,600
out in the pulp so you don't get dry

1752
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,640
pulp but if you're rich it probably

1753
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,500
won't matter because you can buy a

1754
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,719
hundred heads of parsley

1755
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,460
and just spit all that juice out with

1756
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,020
those because you're not worried because

1757
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,820
you're rich you can buy 100 heads of

1758
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,800
parsley all the time but if you're not

1759
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,620
someone who's got

1760
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:43,560
you know big big money and you're not

1761
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,900
like wealthy or anything or well off

1762
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,600
it's best to have a juicer that actually

1763
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:51,239
squeezes the juice out so you're buying

1764
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,880
less parsley so you go and you buy you

1765
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:57,659
know five heads of parsley instead of 15

1766
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:00,360
heads of parsley you know you buy like

1767
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:01,800
six Bunches of celery instead of 20

1768
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,040
Bunches of celery you know what I'm

1769
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,040
saying

1770
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,480
all right now parsley juice

1771
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:12,960
turns into like a gel I'm just letting

1772
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,560
you know if you let it sit long and I

1773
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,560
let it sit

1774
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:22,500
I let it sit long

1775
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:25,140
okay I see daily I see daily people

1776
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:28,260
struggling and commenting about the cost

1777
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:29,580
of food and produce and all food right

1778
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,739
people are having a hard time the cost

1779
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,840
of food is going up the mm-1500 and the

1780
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:36,420
mm-900

1781
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,739
save people money so when they use these

1782
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,679
medicine machines they use these

1783
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:42,540
medicine makers it's squeezing out more

1784
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,280
juice and they're buying less produce

1785
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:46,440
that's where you save money so the

1786
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,239
juicer pays for itself

1787
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,060
and the other juicers don't do that but

1788
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:53,100
here's the other thing the other juicers

1789
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,800
people never really Juiced a lot with

1790
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,000
it's like a juice once a month they use

1791
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,040
it for a couple months and then put it

1792
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,540
in their closet right so that's what

1793
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,620
those are really for people who really

1794
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,000
don't care

1795
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,219
people that have a lot of money they

1796
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,940
juice like once in a blue moon the

1797
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:07,940
medical medium

1798
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:14,580
um endorses the 1500 and the 900 because

1799
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:17,219
it's for the people who juice all day

1800
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:19,020
long like nobody else does like they

1801
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:20,699

it can happen days later even more and

1960
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,900
then a month later you can experience

1961
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:35,940

Jenny Ann says on Instagram as well I

1963
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:42,679
was instantly drawn to your information

1964
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:42,679
it was like finding water in a desert

1965
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:47,460
and we say Angels might put the book in

1966
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:51,020
front of someone

1967
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:51,020
some spiritual

1968
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,140
um Force

1969
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,080
working for the light

1970
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:00,120
maybe God sends a message and you see

1971
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,980
the book maybe it's a friend that hands

1972
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:04,199
you the book maybe the book falls on

1973
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:06,840
your lap providentially maybe something

1974
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:08,340
happens and people find the information

1975
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,020
and then when they find the information

1976
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,940

1977
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,440
