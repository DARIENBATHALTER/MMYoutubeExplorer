[30.56 - 32.96] hello
[33.20 - 37.28] the doctor's ready to talk to me been
[34.88 - 38.24] waiting for hours
[37.28 - 41.12] okay
[38.24 - 43.76] great he's uh he's coming up okay
[41.12 - 45.20] doc dr joni
[43.76 - 47.04] yeah
[45.20 - 48.40] yeah thank you for taking your time out
[47.04 - 50.96] for your busy day i know you got
[48.40 - 53.52] hundreds of patients yeah
[50.96 - 55.44] so when i left your office i didn't know
[53.52 - 57.84] exactly what you meant
[55.44 - 60.24] what yeah the chocolate cake how much
[57.84 - 62.16] chocolate cake can i have
[60.24 - 65.76] yeah was it
[62.16 - 67.04] a slice a day you said moderation and
[65.76 - 68.56] i'm trying to figure this out like the
[67.04 - 70.64] moderation thing
[68.56 - 73.36] yeah because my moderation's different
[70.64 - 75.76] than your moderation possibly
[73.36 - 77.20] because it sounded like to me you have
[75.76 - 79.12] chocolate cake
[77.20 - 81.28] on the weekends i think you were telling
[79.12 - 83.12] me and then i realized when i came back
[81.28 - 84.88] home that i i'm not having chocolate
[83.12 - 88.56] cake on the weekends i'm having
[84.88 - 90.96] chocolate cake tuesday night
[88.56 - 93.04] yeah thursday night
[90.96 - 95.20] and friday night
[93.04 - 98.56] and i think if there's leftover
[95.20 - 100.80] chocolate cake i'm gonna have it on
[98.56 - 102.40] sunday night too
[100.80 - 104.64] and then if there's a little left over
[102.40 - 106.16] i'm gonna have some for monday morning
[104.64 - 107.68] with my coffee
[106.16 - 109.36] is that okay
[107.68 - 112.48] the thing is i don't want to waste the
[109.36 - 115.04] cake when i buy a chocolate cake
[112.48 - 117.92] i have a lot of leftover cake and i
[115.04 - 119.92] can't afford to keep on i can't throw
[117.92 - 122.48] away the cake
[119.92 - 124.08] so how do i freeze it
[122.48 - 126.08] okay i could freeze the chocolate cake
[124.08 - 127.68] that's why that's why
[126.08 - 129.04] it's amazing i got such an incredible
[127.68 - 130.64] doctor
[129.04 - 133.44] you're no no you're welcome you're
[130.64 - 134.48] welcome you are that amazing of a doctor
[133.44 - 136.48] dr
[134.48 - 138.56] dr joni
[136.48 - 140.16] yeah i got another question too so
[138.56 - 141.60] so then
[140.16 - 145.44] so that takes care of the chocolate cake
[141.60 - 147.36] so i also like to have some popcorn
[145.44 - 149.36] movie theater popcorn yeah my friend
[147.36 - 151.92] goes to see the movies and then brings
[149.36 - 154.24] me back a whole bunch of it
[151.92 - 157.04] when do i do the popcorn
[154.24 - 158.80] in between a chocolate cake okay so this
[157.04 - 160.48] this moderation thing i'm really liking
[158.80 - 161.92] this moderation
[160.48 - 163.92] so i can have
[161.92 - 165.20] can i have the whole thing you don't
[163.92 - 167.60] know what i have in my hand you can't
[165.20 - 170.72] see it okay i have a really big thing of
[167.60 - 172.56] popcorn right here so do half of this is
[170.72 - 175.12] that what you're saying a quarter
[172.56 - 177.12] i could do a quarter of this popcorn
[175.12 - 177.92] three times a week
[177.12 - 179.76] okay
[177.92 - 181.92] okay i could do that but there's going
[179.76 - 184.40] to be a leftover quarter
[181.92 - 187.36] because that's three times a week four
[184.40 - 189.28] times a week is four quarters
[187.36 - 191.04] yeah so i could do four times a week
[189.28 - 192.72] okay that's why i had such a smart
[191.04 - 194.56] doctor
[192.72 - 195.60] yeah thank you for helping me out with
[194.56 - 196.84] that i

[460.16 - 465.60] got a busy life and we got a live to do
[463.04 - 466.64] we're talking about moderation okay all
[465.60 - 469.68] right you guys
[466.64 - 471.60] you guys are the greatest all right bye
[469.68 - 473.36] guys we're live right now we're talking
[471.60 - 477.04] about moderation and this is an
[473.36 - 478.56] important live i wonder yeah
[477.04 - 480.16] i
[478.56 - 482.24] i think we have a delayed audience
[480.16 - 484.24] laughter response but we're we're going
[482.24 - 486.64] to find out where it went you know the
[484.24 - 489.76] thing is you guys on this is that
[486.64 - 492.88] when it comes down to moderation right
[489.76 - 495.44] it it's it's rampant because we're
[492.88 - 497.68] talking about autoimmune and moderation
[495.44 - 500.00] they don't fit in they don't work
[497.68 - 501.92] together they don't fit in together
[500.00 - 504.80] they don't work together still waiting
[501.92 - 507.20] for that delay and the thing is is like
[504.80 - 510.40] when it comes down to
[507.20 - 512.24] if you say moderation's okay
[510.40 - 514.56] then
[512.24 - 516.00] someone with autoimmune there it is you
[514.56 - 518.96] guys there it is
[516.00 - 521.36] all right all right
[518.96 - 522.80] there we are
[521.36 - 524.08] it's how things work here they work
[522.80 - 525.36] really good
[524.08 - 527.68] so
[525.36 - 529.12] so the whole thing is so let's talk
[527.68 - 530.88] let's take this serious though we got to
[529.12 - 533.04] take the series we're talking about
[530.88 - 535.84] autoimmune in moderation why they don't
[533.04 - 538.40] blend why they don't mix they just don't
[535.84 - 540.48] mix they just don't blend and this is an
[538.40 - 541.68] important talk because
[540.48 - 544.56] i can tell you right now if you're
[541.68 - 546.40] somebody that's trying to heal if you're
[544.56 - 549.76] somebody that wants to get your life
[546.40 - 553.28] back moderation does not fit into the
[549.76 - 555.12] equation it doesn't it just doesn't fit
[553.28 - 556.16] into the equation
[555.12 - 559.60] because
[556.16 - 560.72] if you have to heal
[559.60 - 563.76] because
[560.72 - 567.28] everything in your body and your mind
[563.76 - 570.32] and your soul wants to heal
[567.28 - 572.28] wants to heal so bad
[570.32 - 574.88] but then you get given
[572.28 - 577.20] misinformation about how you can have a
[574.88 - 579.52] little bit of this and a little bit of
[577.20 - 581.52] that and a little bit of this and a
[579.52 - 583.60] little bit of that
[581.52 - 585.36] that's how we just get in trouble we
[583.60 - 587.60] truly get in trouble
[585.36 - 589.12] and we don't realize it we don't realize
[587.60 - 590.96] how that works
[589.12 - 593.36] because it's like the
[590.96 - 596.80] stopper to us healing that's what it is
[593.36 - 600.16] moderation is like a
[596.80 - 602.64] obstacle right it's like an obstacle
[600.16 - 605.28] that gets in everybody's way and
[602.64 - 608.16] everybody in the health care world and
[605.28 - 611.92] the health care providers in the health
[608.16 - 614.64] world and the health and fitness world
[611.92 - 616.48] all say moderation is okay have some
[614.64 - 619.28] espresso have some coffee have some
[616.48 - 622.08] caffeine have a donut have a
[619.28 - 624.40] cheeseburger right have a little popcorn
[622.08 - 626.16] hey it's organic popcorn have a little
[624.40 - 628.32] organic popcorn right have a little
[626.16 - 630.16] gluten-free pizza or just not even just
[628.32 - 631.68] have pizza just plain old pizza with
[630.16 - 634.40] gluten whatever whatever you're gonna do
[631.68 - 635.84] right you guys we're live on tick tock
[634.40 - 637.28] we're live on facebook i don't know
[635.84 - 639.84] where we're live right now because we
[637.28 - 641.12] got a lot of platforms up right now
[639.84 - 643.36] so
[641.12 - 644.80] anyway
[643.36 - 646.40] we're um
[644.80 - 647.92] so let's let's go into this a little bit
[646.40 - 649.12] about moderation and where we're at
[647.92 - 651.20] where we're all right we're live on
[649.12 - 652.80] telegram right now too i know that
[651.20 - 654.48] we're live on youtube so i'm excited
[652.80 - 655.36] about today
[654.48 - 657.52] so
[655.36 - 661.76] do you ever
[657.52 - 663.04] do you ever wonder why moderation is so
[661.76 - 665.12] easy
[663.04 - 666.64] to get permission for by every single
[665.12 - 668.72] doctor and healthcare practitioner i
[666.64 - 670.64] hear it every single day
[668.72 - 672.72] that's why i'm bringing it up i'm
[670.64 - 676.00] bringing it up because i hear it all the
[672.72 - 678.88] time it's like aw i just got permission
[676.00 - 680.00] to do this is that okay i'm like what
[678.88 - 681.52] and you know what you don't need
[680.00 - 683.44] permission from me you can do what you
[681.52 - 684.96] want your life your choice but what i am
[683.44 - 687.28] going to do is lay out what gets in the
[684.96 - 690.32] way of our health and how we can heal
[687.28 - 693.84] right but moderation can add
[690.32 - 696.64] it can add years missing off your life
[693.84 - 698.48] not adding years to your life too that's
[696.64 - 700.80] another thing because moderation is like
[698.48 - 703.36] that chipper away where it chips away
[700.80 - 705.44] years off your life is what it does
[703.36 - 708.24] and it depends on how far you go into
[705.44 - 710.16] moderation how much into moderation do
[708.24 - 712.72] you do do you drink in moderation like
[710.16 - 715.12] what's drinking in moderation right
[712.72 - 718.32] do you smoke in moderation what do you
[715.12 - 719.60] eat in moderation right all these things
[718.32 - 721.76] that we do
[719.60 - 724.00] and it just it basically becomes a
[721.76 - 725.84] snowball like this moderation snowball
[724.00 - 727.04] and everybody's all trapped in it and
[725.84 - 728.32] their legs are sticking out of that
[727.04 - 729.20] snowball and their arms are sticking out
[728.32 - 730.96] their heads are sticking out the
[729.20 - 732.88] snowball and it's going down the
[730.96 - 735.92] mountain is what it's doing it's like
[732.88 - 737.92] this gigantic moderation snowball
[735.92 - 739.28] if you got autoimmune
[737.92 - 742.00] if you got
[739.28 - 744.00] anxiety depression severe depression
[742.00 - 744.96] if you got any kind of neurological
[744.00 - 746.48] symptom
[744.96 - 749.28] whatever that may be
[746.48 - 751.92] moderation becomes a trap it becomes
[749.28 - 753.84] your enemy it becomes
[751.92 - 756.64] something that really gets in our way
[753.84 - 759.28] and i see it happen all the time it's
[756.64 - 761.44] like we want we're desperate for
[759.28 - 764.16] permission we're desperate for
[761.44 - 766.64] validation we're desperate for somebody
[764.16 - 768.96] to say yeah you can have that
[766.64 - 771.92] yeah you can have a little bit of that
[768.96 - 773.28] you know yeah why not it's good for the
[771.92 - 774.88] soul right
[773.28 - 777.04] well you know i think about what's good
[774.88 - 780.08] for the soul i think about staying here
[777.04 - 781.36] longer staying here not sick
[780.08 - 785.68] staying here
[781.36 - 788.00] feeling good staying here you know
[785.68 - 790.32] an optimum level right or just staying
[788.00 - 792.56] here and functioning on a decent enough
[790.32 - 794.08] level whatever it takes right but
[792.56 - 797.60] staying here you know that's good for
[794.08 - 799.28] the soul i see that as good for the soul
[797.60 - 801.52] and at the same time
[799.28 - 805.92] it's all about
[801.52 - 807.04] how we perceive stuff to you guys right
[805.92 - 809.76] i know
[807.04 - 811.52] people that have had to heal
[809.76 - 814.00] their gastrointestinal tract because it
[811.52 - 816.80] was so bad off and so inflamed and
[814.00 - 819.68] colitis and crohn's and celiac right and
[816.80 - 821.36] ibs and they had to heal it by scaling
[819.68 - 823.04] back on their foods
[821.36 - 824.32] and all of a sudden doing like mono
[823.04 - 826.48] eating right where they're doing
[824.32 - 828.56] potatoes and lettuce or they're doing
[826.48 - 830.24] celery juice and bananas and papaya
[828.56 - 831.04] right and then
[830.24 - 833.60] they
[831.04 - 835.12] healed and they got nice and strong and
[833.60 - 836.80] their intestinal tract got nice and
[835.12 - 838.48] strong and then they can bring in more
[836.80 - 840.16] things then they'll say they're bringing
[838.48 - 842.08] in more things
[840.16 - 843.76] now they're bringing in some avocado now
[842.08 - 845.76] they're bringing in some you know some
[843.76 - 846.96] more different dishes and every single
[845.76 - 848.16] kind of vegetable and then they're
[846.96 - 850.00] bringing some more things and if they're
[848.16 - 851.28] an animal protein person now they're
[850.00 - 852.56] bringing in a little bit of animal
[851.28 - 854.80] protein
[852.56 - 856.72] and they're and they're able to now eat
[854.80 - 859.60] more of what they feel
[856.72 - 861.68] is like an incredible moderation so
[859.60 - 864.48] moderation can like it could be like one
[861.68 - 867.68] to a hundred to have the worst level of
[864.48 - 868.96] moderation there ever was at hunt at a
[867.68 - 871.04] hundred
[868.96 - 872.32] and you can have like the best level of
[871.04 - 876.48] moderation
[872.32 - 879.68] at like one and two and three the 97 98
[876.48 - 881.92] 99 100 the worst level of moderation
[879.68 - 883.68] and people don't realize that it can get
[881.92 - 885.52] like it can snowball it's like you know
[883.68 - 886.96] what i can do this now i could do a
[885.52 - 888.24] little bit of this let me have a little
[886.96 - 890.00] bit of this i could have a cheeseburger
[888.24 - 892.00] twice a week and now i can have you know
[890.00 - 893.60] pancakes this day and now on sunday i'll
[892.00 - 896.32] just have a little bit more and it just
[893.60 - 898.08] takes over and then we're trapped in it
[896.32 - 899.92] and when we get trapped in it it's hard
[898.08 - 903.28] to get out of it especially when we're
[899.92 - 904.08] sick so it's the kind of thing where
[903.28 - 906.00] it's
[904.08 - 907.52] everybody wants to heal they all want to
[906.00 - 909.92] get better they all want to get their
[907.52 - 912.56] lives back
[909.92 - 914.16] but the moderation trap is real and we
[912.56 - 915.92] have to be really careful you see it in
[914.16 - 918.16] every article out there you see people
[915.92 - 919.68] say no i can eat what i want it's cheat
[918.16 - 922.16] day right
[919.68 - 924.16] and so everybody does their cheat days
[922.16 - 926.16] too so they think they can do their
[924.16 - 927.68] cheat day in moderation so everybody
[926.16 - 930.24] still has their moderation now at the
[927.68 - 932.16] same time i don't shame anybody no
[930.24 - 933.76] judgment on anybody if you eat a
[932.16 - 935.36] chocolate cake tomorrow

[1003.04 - 1005.92] check it out
[1004.56 - 1007.76] so
[1005.92 - 1009.60] the whole thing about food is one thing
[1007.76 - 1012.32] about medical medium
[1009.60 - 1014.24] is my mechanism information right
[1012.32 - 1016.00] it's never about shaming
[1014.24 - 1018.72] or judging
[1016.00 - 1020.24] it's always being about being supportive
[1018.72 - 1022.08] with someone wherever they are with
[1020.24 - 1023.76] their foods because i know
[1022.08 - 1025.92] it is hard
[1023.76 - 1027.92] it is hard when you're living with
[1025.92 - 1029.92] family that are eating certain foods
[1027.92 - 1031.52] like i know so many of you guys are so
[1029.92 - 1033.52] you're you're in a situation where you
[1031.52 - 1035.36] got family members right loved ones
[1033.52 - 1036.88] they're eating a certain way
[1035.36 - 1039.44] they're doing what they want to do with
[1036.88 - 1041.04] foods and it's really hard for you
[1039.44 - 1042.56] and i completely understand that when
[1041.04 - 1044.64] it's really hard
[1042.56 - 1045.92] that makes it very difficult and one
[1044.64 - 1049.12] that makes it very difficult that i
[1045.92 - 1050.64] understand so there's that alone right
[1049.12 - 1052.48] so you guys so that's a whole other
[1050.64 - 1054.40] thing and i know that
[1052.48 - 1056.64] that it's different
[1054.40 - 1058.24] when you you're alone if you're somebody
[1056.64 - 1060.00] that lives alone then you could be like
[1058.24 - 1061.84] okay wait a minute i don't have the peer
[1060.00 - 1064.16] pressure someone's not bringing in
[1061.84 - 1066.88] pizzas someone's not bringing but at the
[1064.16 - 1069.04] same time it's easy to just say you know
[1066.88 - 1071.76] what this is what i want or this is what
[1069.04 - 1074.16] i want right so i get it you know and
[1071.76 - 1076.08] it's not an easy road when it comes down
[1074.16 - 1077.92] to food so
[1076.08 - 1079.52] yeah it's really difficult out there
[1077.92 - 1081.92] when you see somebody and they're so
[1079.52 - 1083.76] good with their foods right really like
[1081.92 - 1086.32] great with their foods and then you
[1083.76 - 1087.84] think that they are kind of harping on
[1086.32 - 1088.96] you because you're not that good with
[1087.84 - 1091.60] your foods
[1088.96 - 1093.36] it's it's difficult all around and i've
[1091.60 - 1094.96] seen all the different scenarios out
[1093.36 - 1097.68] there right but you got to keep one
[1094.96 - 1099.84] thing in your in your mind one thing you
[1097.68 - 1101.36] do a little bit out of time a little bit
[1099.84 - 1104.48] at a time
[1101.36 - 1106.24] so i like to kind of reframe moderation
[1104.48 - 1108.56] it's not about
[1106.24 - 1110.80] i could have this in moderation wow what
[1108.56 - 1112.32] a relief right i can have a little bit
[1110.80 - 1113.76] of this in moderation i could have a
[1112.32 - 1115.92] slice of this in moderation i'll have
[1113.76 - 1119.36] some popcorn today not about that
[1115.92 - 1122.00] it's about bringing in the other foods
[1119.36 - 1124.16] it's about bringing in more fruit it's
[1122.00 - 1126.48] about bringing in right
[1124.16 - 1128.64] more brussels sprouts more artichokes
[1126.48 - 1131.76] right more asparagus it's about bringing
[1128.64 - 1133.76] those in until you weed out until you
[1131.76 - 1136.80] push out
[1133.76 - 1138.80] like the moderation foods that's a way
[1136.80 - 1140.96] of doing it that's a great way of doing
[1138.80 - 1142.64] it it's a way you bring in more apples
[1140.96 - 1144.32] and you bring in more oranges and you
[1142.64 - 1146.00] bring in medical medium tools if you can
[1144.32 - 1147.68] like the heavy metal detox smoothies you
[1146.00 - 1149.84] bring in your celery juice and when you
[1147.68 - 1150.88] start bringing all this in it actually
[1149.84 - 1154.00] pushes
[1150.88 - 1155.76] the moderation foods away
[1154.00 - 1157.84] and you start getting stronger and you
[1155.76 - 1159.84] start feeling like better willpower more
[1157.84 - 1160.72] well strong willpower starts to take
[1159.84 - 1163.20] over
[1160.72 - 1164.96] and you can actually push those
[1163.20 - 1166.56] moderation foods away so when someone
[1164.96 - 1168.56] says no you can have that moderation
[1166.56 - 1170.72] you're always like no no you can start
[1168.56 - 1173.52] to feel strength coming up from the
[1170.72 - 1175.28] inner core and you can get that strength
[1173.52 - 1177.76] building up strong in the inner core
[1175.28 - 1180.56] like your soul gets stronger
[1177.76 - 1183.52] your ability to defend yourself
[1180.56 - 1186.24] against the the moderation foods
[1183.52 - 1188.72] starts to get stronger right you get
[1186.24 - 1190.88] that inner strength and it gets better
[1188.72 - 1192.32] that's because when you bring in more
[1190.88 - 1193.68] things so when you start bringing in
[1192.32 - 1195.28] things like
[1193.68 - 1197.28] tomatoes and you're bringing more of
[1195.28 - 1199.28] these and you're snacking on these
[1197.28 - 1201.68] tomatoes something changes when you
[1199.28 - 1204.32] start doing your lemon and lime water
[1201.68 - 1206.64] every single day something starts to
[1204.32 - 1208.72] change right this is when what happens
[1206.64 - 1211.68] so when you're bringing in these foods
[1208.72 - 1213.60] it starts to push away those moderation
[1211.68 - 1215.60] traps right and you're bringing in more
[1213.60 - 1217.44] onions and these are just a few things
[1215.60 - 1219.04] right you're bringing in some onions
[1217.44 - 1220.32] which you can't see right there and
[1219.04 - 1222.32] you're bringing other things when you
[1220.32 - 1224.00] start to bring in
[1222.32 - 1226.24] other foods look at these tomatoes right
[1224.00 - 1227.12] here look how incredible these are right
[1226.24 - 1229.68] and
[1227.12 - 1231.52] it starts to change the game the playing
[1229.68 - 1233.68] field gets different
[1231.52 - 1235.44] you can strengthen in a way because
[1233.68 - 1238.08] you're bringing all these different
[1235.44 - 1239.44] pieces right so what i recommend
[1238.08 - 1241.68] for anybody who's struggling with the
[1239.44 - 1243.44] moderation traps because i know so many
[1241.68 - 1245.68] people are i'm sure you guys are i'm
[1243.44 - 1247.60] sure maybe maybe some of you guys are
[1245.68 - 1248.72] you guys are solid right through the
[1247.60 - 1250.72] moderation
[1248.72 - 1253.60] has it the moderation isn't tempting you
[1250.72 - 1256.72] or the moderation trap isn't in your way
[1253.60 - 1258.32] but if it is in your way okay
[1256.72 - 1259.04] don't think about
[1258.32 - 1260.88] the
[1259.04 - 1262.56] food the unproductive foods and the bad
[1260.88 - 1264.56] foods in the troublemaker foods don't
[1262.56 - 1266.72] think about those as being like oh can i
[1264.56 - 1268.56] eat those think about what can i eat
[1266.72 - 1270.96] that's not these
[1268.56 - 1272.72] and you bring in these other foods you
[1270.96 - 1276.32] bring in the bananas
[1272.72 - 1278.08] right you pick up some cantaloupe okay
[1276.32 - 1280.32] things like you pick up some berries you
[1278.08 - 1283.20] get your frozen wild blueberries and the
[1280.32 - 1285.20] more and more things you bring in
[1283.20 - 1287.60] every even avocado if you gotta bring an
[1285.20 - 1290.56] avocado you bring the avocado in you
[1287.60 - 1292.80] bring that one in right there absolutely
[1290.56 - 1294.88] and then you bring in your leafy greens
[1292.80 - 1297.12] now one of the ways to beat the
[1294.88 - 1299.04] moderation food game
[1297.12 - 1301.12] is get the leafy greens in the trace
[1299.04 - 1302.80] mineral salts to get the celery juice in
[1301.12 - 1304.96] which is the trace mineral salts and to
[1302.80 - 1306.88] get the glucose which is the sugar you
[1304.96 - 1308.40] can get the sugar in because if you
[1306.88 - 1309.92] don't get the good sugar in you're going
[1308.40 - 1311.20] to be getting this sugar right here
[1309.92 - 1312.80] you're going to be looking for this
[1311.20 - 1314.72] sugar this is the one you're going to be
[1312.80 - 1317.04] looking for if you don't get the good
[1314.72 - 1319.76] sugar in if you don't get the good sugar
[1317.04 - 1321.92] in you're going to be trying to get this
[1319.76 - 1323.12] sugar in right here this is
[1321.92 - 1324.56] the sugar
[1323.12 - 1326.80] that's what you're looking for can be
[1324.56 - 1328.32] looking for this if you don't get
[1326.80 - 1329.68] the good sugar if you don't get the good
[1328.32 - 1330.80] sugar in
[1329.68 - 1332.96] you're going to be looking for this
[1330.80 - 1335.76] sugar right here all right that's how it
[1332.96 - 1338.16] works so if you don't get the good stuff
[1335.76 - 1340.24] in like the bananas okay
[1338.16 - 1342.48] you gotta have the stuff around so it's
[1340.24 - 1343.52] critical to have it around you don't
[1342.48 - 1345.92] have
[1343.52 - 1347.44] the trace mineral salt and the glucose
[1345.92 - 1350.48] then you're gonna be just eating
[1347.44 - 1352.40] whatever anything that comes your way
[1350.48 - 1354.08] any friend any neighbor any family
[1352.40 - 1355.36] member that's making something someone
[1354.08 - 1357.28] scooping some ice cream out of the
[1355.36 - 1359.36] freezer you're gonna eat it nothing's
[1357.28 - 1361.04] gonna stop a lot of people from grabbing
[1359.36 - 1363.04] a slice of pizza and then you're going
[1361.04 - 1364.88] to be thinking like well wait i had it
[1363.04 - 1367.92] last week or i had four days ago it's
[1364.88 - 1369.68] moderation i'll i should get by
[1367.92 - 1371.76] and the moderation is just going to beat
[1369.68 - 1373.60] us down it's going to beat us down and
[1371.76 - 1374.56] keep us down
[1373.60 - 1376.96] so
[1374.56 - 1378.64] one of the key things one of the key
[1376.96 - 1380.00] things to remember is you gotta have
[1378.64 - 1382.24] your trace mineral salts you gotta have
[1380.00 - 1384.16] your celery juice you gotta have your
[1382.24 - 1386.16] spinach and leafy greens
[1384.16 - 1387.76] if you can just bring in spinach salads
[1386.16 - 1390.32] every single day with tomatoes and put
[1387.76 - 1393.20] avocado on them just put avocado on them
[1390.32 - 1395.60] have a avocado tomato onion spinach
[1393.20 - 1397.20] salad if you can do your celery juice
[1395.60 - 1398.16] you could do the heavy metal detox
[1397.20 - 1400.08] smoothie
[1398.16 - 1402.00] if you can do the lemon water if you can
[1400.08 - 1403.68] get your trace mineral salts and lots of
[1402.00 - 1405.52] your glucose
[1403.68 - 1407.84] right there you're going to be beating
[1405.52 - 1410.00] the moderation trap you're going to be
[1407.84 - 1411.84] winning if you can get those in because
[1410.00 - 1414.16] you're going to be less
[1411.84 - 1416.48] less apt to actually eating the bad
[1414.16 - 1418.24] stuff when it comes your way so it's
[1416.48 - 1420.32] really about bringing the good stuff in
[1418.24 - 1422.88] and then you push away the bad stuff it
[1420.32 - 1424.64] becomes a natural push off is what
[1422.88 - 1426.56] you're doing a natural way of getting
[1424.64 - 1428.24] those things pushed away and getting
[1426.56 - 1430.88] them out of your life but you got to
[1428.24 - 1433.44] worry about the permission granters
[1430.88 - 1435.28] right got to worry about yeah health
[1433.44 - 1436.96] care providers that say you can have a
[1435.28 - 1439.12] little of this and you can have a little
[1436.96 - 1441.52] of that you can have some of that
[1439.12 - 1444.72] because they're doing it so they're
[1441.52 - 1446.16] doing it and maybe they're not sick yet
[1444.72 - 1447.60] but you could be somebody that's sick
[1446.16 - 1448.80] you're struggling with anxiety you're
[1447.60 - 1450.64] struggling with autoimmune you're
[1448.80 - 1451.92] struggling with neurological symptoms
[1450.64 - 1453.52] and then
[1451.92 - 1455.04] the people that are supposed to be
[1453.52 - 1457.52] watching your back
[1455.04 - 1459.04] because they do the moderation thing and
[1457.52 - 1460.16] eat whatever when they want they're
[1459.04 - 1461.36] going to give you little bits of
[1460.16 - 1462.96] permission and you're going to take
[1461.36 - 1464.56] those bits of permission
[1462.96 - 1466.64] and you're going to take that advice and
[1464.56 - 1468.96] it's going to slow you down
[1466.64 - 1470.08] so we got to remember that we got to
[1468.96 - 1471.44] look out for that of course i always
[1470.08 - 1473.84] want you listening to your doctors and
[1471.44 - 1475.52] practitioners 100 but i also want you to
[1473.84 - 1477.68] be able to protect yourself in any way
[1475.52 - 1480.24] you possibly can and maybe you find a
[1477.68 - 1481.92] doctor that doesn't offer all this other
[1480.24 - 1484.56] foods i'm going off to ig you guys i
[1481.92 - 1486.32] just want to give you a quick moderation
[1484.56 - 1487.52] talk because it's really hitting people
[1486.32 - 1488.64] hard right now
[1487.52 - 1490.48] and um
