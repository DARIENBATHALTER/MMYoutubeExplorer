[836.10 - 841.62] advantage of them say they're me
[839.58 - 843.48] and they're sick too there's some of
[841.62 - 845.28] these imposters are absolutely sick
[843.48 - 848.10] first of all they're all
[845.28 - 849.60] obviously sick right
[848.10 - 852.60] like
[849.60 - 854.94] you know and then on top of it some of
[852.60 - 858.54] them are really Disturbed really
[854.94 - 858.54] Disturbed individuals
[859.92 - 863.82] and then what happens is a couple of
[861.66 - 865.44] people be like I had a reading with
[863.82 - 867.54] medical meme this has been happening for
[865.44 - 870.38] years by the way I had a reading with
[867.54 - 870.38] medical medium
[871.08 - 876.30] no
[873.38 - 878.10] he did not
[876.30 - 882.08] so what I'm doing is mashing up these
[878.10 - 882.08] potatoes getting it ready for
[884.16 - 889.14] potato waffle machine
[885.96 - 891.00] says aw I hope you did not hit the
[889.14 - 894.24] turtle
[891.00 - 895.86] I dare say
[894.24 - 899.16] foreign
[895.86 - 900.60] I did not hit the turtle I promise I did
[899.16 - 904.62] not hit the turtle
[900.60 - 908.78] I helped Turtles and I saved Turtles
[904.62 - 908.78] but I definitely didn't hit the turtle
[910.92 - 914.16] what we're talking about marja what
[912.72 - 917.52] marja is talking about we're talking
[914.16 - 920.70] about the video I just released
[917.52 - 923.54] of me releasing the stones early
[920.70 - 923.54] this morning
[926.22 - 930.80] so we're just mashing these up a little
[927.84 - 930.80] bit more real quick
[939.72 - 943.40] I think what happens is that
[943.92 - 947.34] that there's some serious jealous
[945.96 - 949.50] jealous
[947.34 - 951.12] jealous people
[949.50 - 953.04] they're jealous because they see medical
[951.12 - 955.68] medium out there they're jealous because
[953.04 - 957.90] they see the books out there when you go
[955.68 - 960.90] into like Barnes and Nobles
[957.90 - 962.58] you go into Barnes and Nobles
[960.90 - 964.70] you see all the medical medium books in
[962.58 - 964.70] there
[964.86 - 970.20] and Barnes keeps them in there because
[967.68 - 972.42] people love the medical medium books
[970.20 - 973.86] and they people they heal from the
[972.42 - 975.72] medical medium books and then they tell
[973.86 - 978.36] somebody else about it and they say go
[975.72 - 981.96] to Barnes and Noble and people go in to
[978.36 - 984.36] the store and they get the books out of
[981.96 - 987.06] Barnes and Noble right but for haters
[984.36 - 989.22] and naysayers it's really annoying to
[987.06 - 992.16] have to walk into Barnes and Nobles
[989.22 - 993.48] like you know like naysayers do and they
[992.16 - 995.04] do that they go in there and they go
[993.48 - 996.78] into the health book Department because
[995.04 - 998.82] they're all interested in health and
[996.78 - 1000.56] they walk down the aisle and it's shoved
[998.82 - 1003.26] right in their face
[1000.56 - 1005.18] and they hate it and then they think
[1003.26 - 1006.98] they got all this power and their right
[1005.18 - 1009.08] their social media channel so they just
[1006.98 - 1010.76] use it to be like medical medium is
[1009.08 - 1013.18] terrible medical mediums this medical
[1010.76 - 1015.20] mediums uh it just eats them up alive
[1013.18 - 1019.12] that the books are sitting there in
[1015.20 - 1019.12] Barnes and no for years right
[1020.30 - 1024.04] okay let's make a waffle
[1024.38 - 1029.00] and they're so sick of hearing it
[1026.48 - 1031.42] everywhere edible medium celery juice
[1029.00 - 1031.42] whatever
[1032.18 - 1038.14] so Jeffrey says over there in YouTube I
[1035.24 - 1041.18] released my Stones today it was a relief
[1038.14 - 1044.24] frankly to let go of those three
[1041.18 - 1047.08] emotions they were released into a
[1044.24 - 1050.72] fast-moving Mountain Creek
[1047.08 - 1053.18] that is incredible
[1050.72 - 1054.68] you release them in a fast-moving
[1053.18 - 1057.80] Mountain Creek
[1054.68 - 1061.28] I wish I was there I wish I was standing
[1057.80 - 1063.80] by that Creek with you and I wish I
[1061.28 - 1066.86] watched the stones go in to that Creek
[1063.80 - 1070.22] that was rolling along I would love to
[1066.86 - 1071.84] see that just love to see that Miriam
[1070.22 - 1075.32] over there on YouTube where can I
[1071.84 - 1077.66] release them if no rivers around no Pond
[1075.32 - 1079.76] no Lake no River
[1077.66 - 1081.08] um no Waterway no beach if you don't
[1079.76 - 1083.90] have any of those options you can
[1081.08 - 1086.30] release them in nature a path a trail
[1083.90 - 1088.52] toss them into the woods it couldn't be
[1086.30 - 1091.40] literally on the side of a road Into the
[1088.52 - 1094.16] Woods back into nature where you just
[1091.40 - 1096.80] you send them out and they go and
[1094.16 - 1098.60] they're in nature getting grounded and
[1096.80 - 1100.28] regrounded and neutralized we'll talk
[1098.60 - 1103.16] about that in a little bit Tara Edmonton
[1100.28 - 1104.20] says nutritionists told me to avoid all
[1103.16 - 1107.18] fruit
[1104.20 - 1110.36] nutritionists had all these rules
[1107.18 - 1112.34] rolls rolls rolls Ellie Anderson said
[1110.36 - 1114.08] they told me my son should avoid all
[1112.34 - 1116.84] sorts of fruits and veggies such as
[1114.08 - 1118.28] lemons celery and mango thank God I
[1116.84 - 1120.32] found you very shortly after that
[1118.28 - 1122.90] because it was so stressful and scary
[1120.32 - 1125.54] and didn't make sense
[1122.90 - 1128.00] thank you Allie over there on YouTube
[1125.54 - 1131.18] this is the experiences people have out
[1128.00 - 1132.38] there and that's says a lot it says a
[1131.18 - 1135.32] lot
[1132.38 - 1138.38] so what you'll find out there okay that
[1135.32 - 1142.34] there's a movement a small movement of
[1138.38 - 1144.44] mm haters that's just let's just let's
[1142.34 - 1146.96] just call it like it is let's just be
[1144.44 - 1148.22] you know straight out about it right and
[1146.96 - 1151.10] they're trying to use different tactics
[1148.22 - 1153.26] one of the taxes tactics is
[1151.10 - 1154.96] um restrictions with medical medium
[1153.26 - 1158.30] first of all medical meme information
[1154.96 - 1161.12] can be literally just drinking celery
[1158.30 - 1162.92] juice and that's all you do and you eat
[1161.12 - 1165.74] whatever you're eating that you want to
[1162.92 - 1167.90] eat it can also be more than that it can
[1165.74 - 1169.22] be the morning cleanse then it can be
[1167.90 - 1171.56] the next thing that it can be the next
[1169.22 - 1174.08] thing you can do any you can take your
[1171.56 - 1175.94] feeling as far as you want to go but the
[1174.08 - 1178.22] information is there about how to do it
[1175.94 - 1180.86] but what happens is like the haters
[1178.22 - 1183.20] they'll be like you know they'll try to
[1180.86 - 1186.56] spook people out there and they'll say
[1183.20 - 1189.02] he makes you avoid this medical mediums
[1186.56 - 1190.88] to you know he too restrictive into this
[1189.02 - 1192.98] really
[1190.88 - 1194.24] because all you have to be is like a
[1192.98 - 1196.52] pregnant woman and walk into your
[1194.24 - 1200.24] functional medicine doctor's office and
[1196.52 - 1203.12] you will get an ass kicking when you
[1200.24 - 1205.16] walk in there no fish no this no that no
[1203.12 - 1207.02] this the list like this you walk out of
[1205.16 - 1209.18] there with a list this big
[1207.02 - 1211.70] you can be somebody that just okay let
[1209.18 - 1213.02] me check out this nutritionist dude that
[1211.70 - 1214.58] they're talking about or let me check
[1213.02 - 1216.56] out this dude over here there's this
[1214.58 - 1218.30] dietitian let me go check them out and
[1216.56 - 1219.56] you go in there and dietitian is like
[1218.30 - 1221.36] make sure you're this make sure it's
[1219.56 - 1222.86] pasture raised make sure your eggs are
[1221.36 - 1226.52] organic make sure you're this and just
[1222.86 - 1228.44] like what what there's a ton of rules oh
[1226.52 - 1230.90] stay away from carbs stay away from this
[1228.44 - 1232.34] say oh yeah you can have chocolate once
[1230.90 - 1233.90] in a while and you can have this once in
[1232.34 - 1235.64] a while but stay away from this this and
[1233.90 - 1237.86] here's the crazy thing
[1235.64 - 1239.90] they don't know why you're sick to begin
[1237.86 - 1241.70] with well you got all your neurological
[1239.90 - 1243.92] symptoms why you've been sick for 10
[1241.70 - 1247.82] years that's what's really funny right
[1243.92 - 1250.04] and then glycosate right like the whole
[1247.82 - 1251.84] thing with like
[1250.04 - 1254.00] um
[1251.84 - 1255.20] the whole thing too with pesticides
[1254.00 - 1257.36] right
[1255.20 - 1258.80] that whole thing too
[1257.36 - 1260.92] I've been talking about pesticides for
[1258.80 - 1264.02] years years years and they'll say avoid
[1260.92 - 1266.24] pesticides right
[1264.02 - 1267.98] avoid pesticides because pesticides have
[1266.24 - 1270.86] terrible things in them and look it's
[1267.98 - 1272.72] out there the whole bit
[1270.86 - 1274.70] and they'll do that too and it's like
[1272.72 - 1276.02] yeah because here we need to avoid
[1274.70 - 1277.94] pesticides you want to go and drink
[1276.02 - 1279.32] pesticides do you want to go and drink a
[1277.94 - 1280.94] whole bunch of pesticides yeah you got
[1279.32 - 1283.52] to avoid it of course you of course you
[1280.94 - 1284.72] do unless you just want to live in a
[1283.52 - 1286.64] world
[1284.72 - 1288.62] where
[1286.64 - 1290.60] there's there's words on here you've got
[1288.62 - 1293.06] to be careful what you said by the way
[1290.60 - 1294.74] on social I'm letting you guys know
[1293.06 - 1296.42] there's some words
[1294.74 - 1298.94] that are key words
[1296.42 - 1301.94] just you don't want to say in Social
[1298.94 - 1304.34] there's a reason whether it's it's wired
[1301.94 - 1306.08] in and there's a reason and I got enough
[1304.34 - 1307.76] I got enough
[1306.08 - 1308.96] censorship and everything else through
[1307.76 - 1310.76] the roof
[1308.96 - 1312.56] so you know what I mean by the pesticide
[1310.76 - 1315.32] thing and that word that I stopped
[1312.56 - 1317.78] myself from saying God
[1315.32 - 1319.64] right you know that word okay that word
[1317.78 - 1322.52] by the way is uh that's a trigger word
[1319.64 - 1323.96] on social in the engines anyway the
[1322.52 - 1325.58] whole point is
[1323.96 - 1327.38] is that
[1325.58 - 1329.84] um they
[1327.38 - 1332.00] of course I mean you can be somebody
[1329.84 - 1333.86] that doesn't avoid anything at all
[1332.00 - 1335.18] just eat what you want where are you
[1333.86 - 1336.80] where are you gonna hear that though
[1335.18 - 1339.38] where are you gonna hear that from any
[1336.80 - 1340.88] reasonable person eat and do everything
[1339.38 - 1343.28] you want
[1340.88 - 1347.00] while you're sick
[1343.28 - 1348.76] while you're sick and nowadays even when
[1347.00 - 1351.20] you're not sick people
[1348.76 - 1352.82] professionals aren't saying do what you
[1351.20 - 1355.40] want
[1352.82 - 1357.20] that's that those days are gone those
[1355.40 - 1361.46] days are gone they're in the dust
[1357.20 - 1365.06] they're in the past those days
[1361.46 - 1367.58] rules rules rules rules everywhere
[1365.06 - 1370.16] everywhere everywhere everywhere problem
[1367.58 - 1372.20] is though can have all the rules but not
[1370.16 - 1373.82] know what's wrong with the person and
[1372.20 - 1375.32] why they're really sick and struggling
[1373.82 - 1376.70] with their autoimmune and every other
[1375.32 - 1379.04] condition they have
[1376.70 - 1380.36] and the thing is with mm info it's
[1379.04 - 1381.98] healing people around the world and
[1380.36 - 1383.84] already has a track record of it because
[1381.98 - 1386.62] you find out why you're sick and what's
[1383.84 - 1389.72] wrong and then you find out why there is
[1386.62 - 1391.16] options choices you can make for this
[1389.72 - 1393.14] and choices you can make for this and
[1391.16 - 1396.44] what direction you want to go
[1393.14 - 1400.00] it's really quite incredible all right
[1396.44 - 1400.00] let's get a waffle going here
[1403.04 - 1407.12] but I mean seriously it's a real real
[1404.78 - 1409.64] head screw
[1407.12 - 1412.28] overall the amount of things people are
[1409.64 - 1415.52] told to avoid
[1412.28 - 1417.44] I think the worst thing I hear is avoid
[1415.52 - 1420.14] sugar
[1417.44 - 1421.88] and sweets when really it's not the
[1420.14 - 1423.56] sugar and the sweet I'm not saying it's
[1421.88 - 1426.14] good to eat a whole bunch of table sugar
[1423.56 - 1429.02] like you you shouldn't just go and scoff
[1426.14 - 1430.82] down a bag of table sugar
[1429.02 - 1432.20] you know like that's something you
[1430.82 - 1434.30] shouldn't do
[1432.20 - 1437.06] all right let's let's get a waffle in
[1434.30 - 1439.70] here let's see what size we have
[1437.06 - 1442.96] let's hope that pretty much does it
[1439.70 - 1442.96] yeah I think we did it
[1443.48 - 1446.98] kind of put a little weight on there
[1447.26 - 1451.34] but I think the carbs and the sugar
[1449.24 - 1453.56] avoid carbs and sugar without really
[1451.34 - 1455.06] understanding why and what kind of carbs
[1453.56 - 1456.98] you're talking about the reason I talk
[1455.06 - 1460.58] about it is because once you start
[1456.98 - 1463.58] healing you get attacked by people
[1460.58 - 1465.56] they will go out of their way to DM you
[1463.58 - 1467.90] and comment and convince you not to do
[1465.56 - 1470.18] medical medium and they use these
[1467.90 - 1472.16] tactics once you are seasoned enough to
[1470.18 - 1474.14] understand what I'm talking about you'll
[1472.16 - 1476.12] know what they're doing so the goal is
[1474.14 - 1477.74] to DM people that's what the haters are
[1476.12 - 1480.94] doing right now they have a full
[1477.74 - 1480.94] campaign on all the time
[1481.22 - 1487.64] the goal is to DM you or reach out to
[1485.42 - 1489.50] you or put posts out there to confuse
[1487.64 - 1492.70] people then reach out to them once they
[1489.50 - 1492.70] comment and be like yeah
[1492.74 - 1497.30] and it's tactics that that are being
[1494.96 - 1499.70] used to throw people off of their
[1497.30 - 1501.92] healing to throw them off of their game
[1499.70 - 1504.50] as they're trying to recover
[1501.92 - 1507.20] seasoned people can pick this off and
[1504.50 - 1509.12] understand this but unseasoned people
[1507.20 - 1510.62] will have to lose another two three
[1509.12 - 1511.82] years of their healing process maybe
[1510.62 - 1513.56] five years of the healing process
[1511.82 - 1514.82] because they've been thrown in a
[1513.56 - 1517.82] different direction
[1514.82 - 1520.28] people's families or friends also do it
[1517.82 - 1524.98] peer pressure happens all the time
[1520.28 - 1524.98] because it's no fun to avoid fun Foods
[1526.04 - 1529.84] all right so we got some waffles going
[1531.32 - 1537.76] that was a big waffle so here we go
[1534.80 - 1537.76] scoop that up
[1538.64 - 1542.90] great smell
[1540.92 - 1544.64] hmm
[1542.90 - 1546.92] so good
[1544.64 - 1548.90] excited
[1546.92 - 1550.58] I got some cayenne pepper here I can't
[1548.90 - 1552.68] get enough of my cayenne's out of the
[1550.58 - 1554.84] garden so I try to find every single
[1552.68 - 1557.42] excuse to use them I think what I'll do
[1554.84 - 1560.48] is I'll put a couple on top I've got
[1557.42 - 1562.70] some nectarines here actually my slice
[1560.48 - 1565.04] some nectarines
[1562.70 - 1567.56] put those on top of a waffle got maple
[1565.04 - 1569.18] syrup this is a real simple recipe you
[1567.56 - 1570.29] can go to town you can do what you want
[1569.18 - 1572.72] you can go to town
[1570.29 - 1575.56] [Music]
[1572.72 - 1575.56] that's right David
[1576.14 - 1580.36] it's always somebody watching
[1580.76 - 1584.78] so you guys if you just got here this is
[1582.80 - 1587.48] day seven of the medical meme collecting
[1584.78 - 1589.88] Stones meditation Journey
[1587.48 - 1593.00] I promised you you'll never forget this
[1589.88 - 1596.20] journey I promise you that you'll never
[1593.00 - 1596.20] ever forget it
[1597.92 - 1600.80] and
[1599.00 - 1602.72] this is a very moving day and a very
[1600.80 - 1604.88] emotional day I've released my Stones
[1602.72 - 1606.50] today I hope that you got a chance to
[1604.88 - 1608.42] release your Stones I know that many
[1606.50 - 1609.80] people are waiting probably towards the
[1608.42 - 1611.72] end of the day to release their stones
[1609.80 - 1613.64] and there may be even a few people that
[1611.72 - 1615.86] probably won't release them they should
[1613.64 - 1619.34] though it's good to release them today
[1615.86 - 1621.62] that would be fantastic
[1619.34 - 1623.06] Rhonda Johansson says some people just
[1621.62 - 1627.02] can't handle the truth about
[1623.06 - 1630.28] Troublemaker Foods that's true too
[1627.02 - 1630.28] I think we just lost TT
[1630.38 - 1636.16] I smell a waffle a delicious waffle
[1633.44 - 1636.16] cooking right now
[1637.88 - 1642.76] so let's talk about Road walks it's
[1639.38 - 1642.76] something that happens all the time
[1643.34 - 1646.58] say you're somebody and you're just
[1644.48 - 1649.52] eating complete just standard European
[1646.58 - 1651.32] or standard American
[1649.52 - 1653.00] that's what you do
[1651.32 - 1656.66] you're raised on standard American
[1653.00 - 1658.82] you're raised on standard European
[1656.66 - 1662.72] because they're both bad
[1658.82 - 1665.90] Europeans will tell you they're both bad
[1662.72 - 1668.90] and you're raised on that standard
[1665.90 - 1670.76] and then you start getting sick
[1668.90 - 1672.38] and then you seek help and you go to
[1670.76 - 1673.76] just a regular doctor and the doctor
[1672.38 - 1675.68] doesn't care about what you're eating
[1673.76 - 1677.06] you might find a doctor that just
[1675.68 - 1678.68] doesn't care they just want to do work
[1677.06 - 1680.06] up check things out they won't even ask
[1678.68 - 1681.98] you about your diet or anything like
[1680.06 - 1684.20] that
[1681.98 - 1686.48] and they send you on your way maybe they
[1684.20 - 1687.92] give you a drug or two prescription and
[1686.48 - 1690.08] they send you on your way
[1687.92 - 1692.06] and then
[1690.08 - 1694.22] you're just not getting better
[1692.06 - 1696.02] so you go to another doctor
[1694.22 - 1699.32] Jenny Jenn says the days of speaking
[1696.02 - 1701.86] freely and openly are gone bye bye
[1699.32 - 1701.86] I agree
[1703.52 - 1707.90] this waffle is cooking I have the
[1706.22 - 1709.34] temperature
[1707.90 - 1711.02] jacked up
[1709.34 - 1712.40] and then you go to another doctor and
[1711.02 - 1713.90] another doctor says you know what what
[1712.40 - 1715.22] are you doing for Foods because the
[1713.90 - 1716.66] doctor's more interested in that and
[1715.22 - 1718.58] you're like hearing it now all of a
[1716.66 - 1720.26] sudden you're like stay away from this
[1718.58 - 1722.42] stay away from sugar stay away from
[1720.26 - 1727.40] sweets you're starting to hear that it's
[1722.42 - 1729.08] a slow slow climb upward to your healing
[1727.40 - 1732.08] process
[1729.08 - 1733.58] and even then even if you find a guru
[1732.08 - 1735.14] somewhere that's telling you what to
[1733.58 - 1737.06] avoid
[1735.14 - 1738.92] chances are you won't know the answers
[1737.06 - 1740.66] to why you were sick to begin with and
[1738.92 - 1742.54] why you're even avoiding everything
[1740.66 - 1745.58] you'll just hear the blanket statement
[1742.54 - 1747.56] avoid these things because it causes
[1745.58 - 1749.84] inflammation
[1747.56 - 1751.64] avoid these things because it's not good
[1749.84 - 1753.86] with autoimmune
[1751.64 - 1755.84] but you're still in the woods and you're
[1753.86 - 1759.08] still deep in the hole
[1755.84 - 1761.42] because that's not enough
[1759.08 - 1763.04] and then you run into a whole bunch of
[1761.42 - 1764.96] different things in people along the way
[1763.04 - 1767.00] this person says tripod map this another
[1764.96 - 1768.80] person says right try gaps another
[1767.00 - 1770.54] person says boom triggers another person
[1768.80 - 1773.66] says oh try but let's type another
[1770.54 - 1775.52] person says oh try this try that
[1773.66 - 1776.36] and you hear it over and over and over
[1775.52 - 1778.94] again
[1776.36 - 1781.16] and then it oscillates
[1778.94 - 1783.74] and then it's lectins and then it's one
[1781.16 - 1785.24] thing after another carbs sugar too much
[1783.74 - 1788.86] sugar and then you hear it and now
[1785.24 - 1788.86] you're just in the abyss of hell
[1789.08 - 1792.86] let's see on IG you are doing the same
[1791.18 - 1796.16] thing you are saying they are doing
[1792.86 - 1798.68] laugh out loud over and over
[1796.16 - 1801.56] that's my point thank you for saying
[1798.68 - 1803.78] that on IG that's my whole point
[1801.56 - 1806.30] because they're telling me
[1803.78 - 1810.44] out there the haters have a campaign
[1806.30 - 1812.12] saying that I have restrictions that mm
[1810.44 - 1814.40] is restrictive and you should be allowed
[1812.12 - 1816.68] to eat anything you wanted
[1814.40 - 1817.94] by the way in the same breath they say
[1816.68 - 1820.04] that they say check out this
[1817.94 - 1822.32] nutritionist guy here on social check
[1820.04 - 1823.88] out this PhD over here on social check
[1822.32 - 1826.76] out this guy and when you check them out
[1823.88 - 1829.51] they're giving you a hundred rules
[1826.76 - 1830.72] that's my whole point
[1829.51 - 1832.34] [Music]
[1830.72 - 1835.84] but here's the best part of the point
[1832.34 - 1835.84] they don't know why you're sick
[1836.12 - 1839.60] and the medical medium books tell you
[1837.80 - 1842.12] why you're sick and that's why this the
[1839.60 - 1845.30] street cred and the record is that huge
[1842.12 - 1848.30] of people healing around the world but
[1845.30 - 1850.22] that makes me a dangerous person because
[1848.30 - 1852.56] too many people are healing and too many
[1850.22 - 1854.72] people are finding answers
[1852.56 - 1857.36] and then you get jealousy and hate in
[1854.72 - 1860.06] the competitor world of the natural food
[1857.36 - 1861.86] movement which is all about marketing
[1860.06 - 1864.50] and sales and they don't like medical
[1861.86 - 1866.66] medium in the way especially when
[1864.50 - 1868.46] medical medium blows the horn and the
[1866.66 - 1871.22] whistle on a whole bunch of things that
[1868.46 - 1873.74] are really bad for you out there
[1871.22 - 1875.72] and then I just become this thing that's
[1873.74 - 1877.82] in the way
[1875.72 - 1879.98] and that's how it works
[1877.82 - 1881.90] now let's take a look at this waffle but
[1879.98 - 1884.66] I'm not quite sure it's done
[1881.90 - 1888.04] a couple more minutes
[1884.66 - 1888.04] can't wait to make another one
[1888.20 - 1892.58] medical medium directory has a lot of
[1890.12 - 1894.08] things that I use check it out
[1892.58 - 1895.94] in case you're interested in something
[1894.08 - 1897.87] or whatever
[1895.94 - 1900.20] I don't own the companies
[1897.87 - 1903.14] [Music]
[1900.20 - 1906.56] getting a plate out
[1903.14 - 1909.64] people are asking questions
[1906.56 - 1909.64] that's why I said that
[1911.30 - 1915.44] lamb tail said on YouTube My Dentist
[1913.40 - 1918.02] told me to stop drinking lemon water and
[1915.44 - 1922.06] I said no laugh out loud he was not
[1918.02 - 1922.06] happy but I couldn't lie
[1924.02 - 1928.72] patient
[1925.52 - 1928.72] Dental patient
[1931.94 - 1936.10] do not use lemon water
[1936.26 - 1939.56] because you're going to destroy all your
[1938.00 - 1942.50] teeth you know what's going to destroy
[1939.56 - 1945.10] everybody's teeth vinegar
[1942.50 - 1945.10] vinegar
[1945.80 - 1950.66] do you see vinegar anywhere
[1948.02 - 1952.34] get rid of it
[1950.66 - 1954.74] can you still heal and do a little
[1952.34 - 1957.02] vinegar depends on what's wrong with you
[1954.74 - 1959.12] because there's a scale
[1957.02 - 1960.74] like I said you can drink celery just do
[1959.12 - 1963.32] celery juice your acid reflux is gone
[1960.74 - 1965.48] you move on with your life fine
[1963.32 - 1967.04] something else going on you you need to
[1965.48 - 1969.08] increase you need to bring in other
[1967.04 - 1971.60] things you got to learn how to become
[1969.08 - 1973.40] your expert your own expert and you need
[1971.60 - 1976.40] to know the tools and you can do that
[1973.40 - 1978.86] with MN mm info but keep in mind right
[1976.40 - 1981.68] if you're worried about teeth drop the
[1978.86 - 1984.02] vinegar because they will annihilate
[1981.68 - 1987.02] your teeth over time apple cider vinegar
[1984.02 - 1989.66] will by the way I pissed off the apple
[1987.02 - 1994.06] cider vinegar industry really bad in the
[1989.66 - 1994.06] last so-called years so many years
[1996.38 - 2001.66] Duff says on IG everything I've read and
[1999.44 - 2004.90] listened from you makes absolute sense
[2001.66 - 2006.70] and works I'm feeling great trying to
[2004.90 - 2008.80] spread the word to those that are
[2006.70 - 2010.54] willing to listen thank you you are a
[2008.80 - 2012.28] warrior
[2010.54 - 2016.30] you are a warrior because the medical
[2012.28 - 2017.92] medium Community takes a lot of crap
[2016.30 - 2020.38] when they say I'm healing with medical
[2017.92 - 2021.46] medium then a whole bunch of trolls come
[2020.38 - 2023.50] in
[2021.46 - 2026.14] or haters
[2023.50 - 2028.54] we all have a choice of what we consume
[2026.14 - 2030.28] over there NRG
[2028.54 - 2032.38] so I'm cooking this a little bit longer
[2030.28 - 2034.30] I let it hit that temperature Where It
[2032.38 - 2036.58] beeped Boop
[2034.30 - 2040.26] Boop letting it cook a little bit longer
[2036.58 - 2040.26] I want my Waffle crispy
[2040.30 - 2044.52] yeah if we know the truth about things
[2047.44 - 2051.40] Erie says Anthony can you consider the
[2049.48 - 2053.50] idea of visiting Sweden I would love to
[2051.40 - 2055.36] visit Sweden
[2053.50 - 2059.56] someday
[2055.36 - 2062.76] we only have a choice if we know
[2059.56 - 2062.76] we have a choice
[2062.98 - 2066.40] we can't make a choice if we don't know
[2065.14 - 2067.96] the answers
[2066.40 - 2069.22] we can't make a choice if we don't know
[2067.96 - 2070.96] why we're sick
[2069.22 - 2072.88] we can make a choice but it could be a
[2070.96 - 2074.92] wrong choice
[2072.88 - 2076.72] when we learn why we're sick truly why
[2074.92 - 2078.88] we're sick then we can make choices and
[2076.72 - 2081.60] if we know tools to really help us we
[2078.88 - 2081.60] can make choices
[2084.04 - 2087.90] I'm going to make a couple different
[2085.24 - 2087.90] waffles
[2098.28 - 2103.02] thank you for being in my kitchen you
[2100.84 - 2103.02] guys
[2103.60 - 2106.44] foreign
[2106.84 - 2112.08] I think I'm going to use this platter
[2108.58 - 2112.08] right here if you guys don't mind
[2112.96 - 2119.40] put it right here
[2115.14 - 2119.40] I'm going to make a couple of waffles
[2122.20 - 2125.40] letting it cook for another minute
[2126.88 - 2129.73] okay there we go
[2128.98 - 2133.33] I think
[2129.73 - 2133.33] [Music]
[2135.22 - 2139.36] even says that happened to me 11 years
[2137.50 - 2141.70] ago at the doctor's office and I had to
[2139.36 - 2144.16] figure out Health on my own and when
[2141.70 - 2146.68] vegan but have needed to clean up my
[2144.16 - 2148.42] diet even more as I got older and your
[2146.68 - 2151.48] info has saved me and I want to talk
[2148.42 - 2152.92] about that right now about vegans
[2151.48 - 2154.78] this is an important piece of
[2152.92 - 2156.94] information there's vegan and there's
[2154.78 - 2158.38] medical medium vegan
[2156.94 - 2161.26] there's animal based then there's
[2158.38 - 2163.18] medical medium animal base
[2161.26 - 2166.96] there's plant-based
[2163.18 - 2168.82] but there's medical medium plant-based
[2166.96 - 2170.74] very important to know entirely
[2168.82 - 2173.56] different two different things so many
[2170.74 - 2176.14] people went vegan and stayed sick or got
[2173.56 - 2178.30] sicker so many people went plant-based
[2176.14 - 2179.74] and stayed sick and got sicker they
[2178.30 - 2181.36] still had to learn why they were sick
[2179.74 - 2183.16] and then all the different tools and
[2181.36 - 2185.68] options they can apply while being
[2183.16 - 2188.32] plant-based or vegan
[2185.68 - 2190.00] The Details Matter Hannah says on
[2188.32 - 2193.02] YouTube Hannah I always read your
[2190.00 - 2193.02] comments on YouTube too
[2194.80 - 2199.66] so that's an important distinction right
[2196.72 - 2201.70] there and a critical one at that
[2199.66 - 2205.56] when someone says well I'm vegan I don't
[2201.70 - 2205.56] need to do medical medium it's like okay
[2206.08 - 2211.06] as if all the answers are encompassed
[2208.78 - 2213.22] and just being vegan
[2211.06 - 2215.50] you can be vegan and still eat all the
[2213.22 - 2217.30] wrong things while you're sick because
[2215.50 - 2219.58] you can still be vegan and not know why
[2217.30 - 2220.78] you're sick you can still be plant-based
[2219.58 - 2221.92] eat all the wrong things while you're
[2220.78 - 2223.54] sick
[2221.92 - 2225.64] and not know why you're sick as your
[2223.54 - 2227.14] plant-based you can be animal based and
[2225.64 - 2228.88] not know why you're sick and eat all the
[2227.14 - 2231.52] wrong things you can be this really
[2228.88 - 2234.76] healthy healthy meaning healthy kind of
[2231.52 - 2237.28] eating animal-based person
[2234.76 - 2238.30] still be sick get sicker not in a while
[2237.28 - 2240.70] you're sick
[2238.30 - 2243.22] you can that's how it works medical meme
[2240.70 - 2244.78] information isn't about
[2243.22 - 2246.52] you know
[2244.78 - 2248.68] I mean it's that's the bottom line
[2246.52 - 2251.44] Jackie B says before I found NM I was
[2248.68 - 2254.82] naive vegan so you weren't medical
[2251.44 - 2254.82] median vegan right
[2255.70 - 2259.30] and that's something that people don't
[2257.50 - 2261.52] understand they Encompass the whole
[2259.30 - 2264.90] vegan thing and that's it
[2261.52 - 2264.90] all right so let's get this out
[2269.14 - 2275.50] on IG Cosmic Affinity they were trying
[2272.62 - 2278.46] to get 12 vials of blood out of me
[2275.50 - 2282.52] yesterday and I wouldn't let them do
[2278.46 - 2285.48] that so I left thanks for the blood draw
[2282.52 - 2288.40] episode epic episode I think you said
[2285.48 - 2289.90] yesterday and wouldn't let me do less
[2288.40 - 2291.52] that's what it is so I left they
[2289.90 - 2294.48] wouldn't let you do less
[2291.52 - 2294.48] well
[2298.02 - 2304.54] I don't want to put you know put my
[2301.78 - 2307.54] blood in the waffle right here where my
[2304.54 - 2308.80] vials of blood right here
[2307.54 - 2310.30] um
[2308.80 - 2311.98] we'll talk about that for a little bit
[2310.30 - 2313.30] that's another important distinction
[2311.98 - 2315.58] right there the blood draw information
[2313.30 - 2316.96] is critical and it sets medical medium
[2315.58 - 2319.06] information apart from all the other
[2316.96 - 2321.10] vegan people out there in the world and
[2319.06 - 2322.60] plant-based authorities or whatever you
[2321.10 - 2324.10] call them I'm not against getting your
[2322.60 - 2325.66] blood drawn I'm about doing small
[2324.10 - 2327.22] amounts and I'll talk about that for a
[2325.66 - 2329.62] second I think it's well deserved
[2327.22 - 2331.78] deserving
[2329.62 - 2333.04] I just hope I cook this waffle good
[2331.78 - 2333.88] enough because
[2333.04 - 2336.72] um
[2333.88 - 2336.72] yeah I did
[2337.36 - 2341.38] do I drive you guys crazy when I cook in
[2340.06 - 2343.66] the sense where you're like I could do a
[2341.38 - 2346.48] better job than medical medium get me in
[2343.66 - 2349.60] that kitchen medical me
[2346.48 - 2352.18] he's always up to he's always up to no
[2349.60 - 2353.38] good when he's cooking
[2352.18 - 2356.58] okay
[2353.38 - 2356.58] get another waffle going
[2364.00 - 2369.30] I'm gonna put it right in the middle
[2366.34 - 2369.30] look at this
[2370.92 - 2374.70] let's get that rolling
[2376.72 - 2381.70] prime example of the difference between
[2378.88 - 2384.48] medical medium plant-based and regular
[2381.70 - 2384.48] plant-based
[2384.94 - 2389.40] because if your medical medium
[2386.32 - 2389.40] plant-based you'll learn
[2390.04 - 2395.10] that it's critical to be cautious on how
[2392.14 - 2395.10] much blood is drawn
[2395.86 - 2399.58] and you maybe would have heard the
[2397.60 - 2401.38] podcast or read the Brain book and
[2399.58 - 2404.44] learned all about it about
[2401.38 - 2406.44] getting half files getting asking your
[2404.44 - 2410.14] doctor for Less blood at one time
[2406.44 - 2412.18] because you lose your immune system
[2410.14 - 2414.34] you lose your immune system and you can
[2412.18 - 2415.90] be plant-based sick
[2414.34 - 2418.00] go to your functional medicine doctors
[2415.90 - 2419.92] that even are fine in baggy bean
[2418.00 - 2421.72] plant-based draw too much blood
[2419.92 - 2423.34] periodically because you're sick and get
[2421.72 - 2424.66] sick or plant-based and that's the
[2423.34 - 2426.34] difference between plant-based
[2424.66 - 2427.84] non-medical medium plant-based medical
[2426.34 - 2429.82] medium
[2427.84 - 2431.56] that's just one example keep that in
[2429.82 - 2433.66] mind
[2431.56 - 2434.98] by the way you guys were day seven of
[2433.66 - 2436.66] the medical medium collecting Stones
[2434.98 - 2440.16] meditation Journey
[2436.66 - 2440.16] and here's what's crazy
[2441.52 - 2447.04] like insane
[2444.88 - 2448.60] the sicker you get the more blood they
[2447.04 - 2450.70] take
[2448.60 - 2452.68] the sicker you get the more blood they
[2450.70 - 2455.86] take you think I'm done
[2452.68 - 2457.84] and the sicker you get again the more
[2455.86 - 2460.06] blood they take but the more blood they
[2457.84 - 2463.60] take and get ready for this
[2460.06 - 2466.24] you can be death bed sick and they will
[2463.60 - 2468.66] take even more blood essentially they'll
[2466.24 - 2468.66] kill you
[2469.18 - 2473.56] but ask your doctor what's right for you
[2472.06 - 2474.82] I'm just saying that's what I recommend
[2473.56 - 2476.62] friends and family
[2474.82 - 2478.48] be cautious about the the amount of
[2476.62 - 2480.76] blood being taken at once find a new
[2478.48 - 2483.54] Doctor Who will listen you can advocate
[2480.76 - 2483.54] for yourself
[2484.84 - 2491.34] pressing this waffle down a little bit
[2486.52 - 2491.34] because I want to just spread that out
[2496.60 - 2500.26] yeah
[2498.40 - 2502.06] and that's one of the examples right
[2500.26 - 2503.74] there which is really important just
[2502.06 - 2506.56] like you could be plant-based but
[2503.74 - 2509.20] literally fat yourself to death and
[2506.56 - 2512.98] throw yourself into pancreatitis you can
[2509.20 - 2515.56] be plant-based and be dropping oil
[2512.98 - 2517.50] eating too much Nut Butter I'm not
[2515.56 - 2520.00] against Nut Butter I'm not against
[2517.50 - 2521.38] avocado that's not it but if you're
[2520.00 - 2522.46] really sick and struggling and you don't
[2521.38 - 2524.68] know what's going on and you go
[2522.46 - 2526.96] plant-based and now you're just chowing
[2524.68 - 2528.64] the cacao and you're chowing all that
[2526.96 - 2530.02] cacao butter I'm serious you guys this
[2528.64 - 2532.00] is an important topic
[2530.02 - 2534.58] and you're you're gobbling down that
[2532.00 - 2536.50] cacao powder and that those cacao nibs
[2534.58 - 2538.24] and all those chocolate bars in your
[2536.50 - 2541.30] plant-based
[2538.24 - 2543.52] yeah you can still get yourself sick if
[2541.30 - 2545.98] you're sick
[2543.52 - 2548.62] light heart over on IG says that's what
[2545.98 - 2552.30] they did to my grandma with cirrhosis
[2548.62 - 2552.30] bled her to death
[2560.32 - 2565.30] reason why I have these vials and this
[2562.72 - 2567.94] vial this
[2565.30 - 2569.92] big tube of blood because when I was in
[2567.94 - 2571.60] I was in the doctor's office and they're
[2569.92 - 2573.22] pulling too much out I just grabbed it I
[2571.60 - 2575.14] said no you're not that that's it you're
[2573.22 - 2577.06] not taking any more I'm going and I went
[2575.14 - 2578.50] out the door I put it in my fridge you
[2577.06 - 2580.00] know I'm kidding around I didn't do that
[2578.50 - 2583.18] this is ketchup
[2580.00 - 2583.18] [Music]
[2583.66 - 2586.32] it's ketchup
[2589.06 - 2592.96] so all these things matter so we'll go
[2591.34 - 2594.16] into a little bit first I wanna I did
[2592.96 - 2595.30] promise you guys I was going to talk
[2594.16 - 2596.92] about
[2595.30 - 2598.42] The Seventh-Day collecting Stones
[2596.92 - 2600.52] meditation journey and releasing the
[2598.42 - 2603.16] stones I just want to give you this
[2600.52 - 2607.30] really important piece that's critical
[2603.16 - 2609.46] okay so what these Stones were doing all
[2607.30 - 2612.34] week as you were getting that connection
[2609.46 - 2615.34] with your Stones was absorbing
[2612.34 - 2617.92] Old Wounds old hardships all kinds of
[2615.34 - 2620.26] different scars on our soul
[2617.92 - 2622.30] on our spirit all of this that we
[2620.26 - 2624.58] contend with that's buried in stuff deep
[2622.30 - 2626.14] down inside of us and we're getting that
[2624.58 - 2628.12] and it's what's happening we're getting
[2626.14 - 2629.56] that out of us and it's drawing into the
[2628.12 - 2631.90] stones
[2629.56 - 2634.00] and as it draws into the stones Stones
[2631.90 - 2636.04] fill up because what those minerals do
[2634.00 - 2638.20] in the stones is they receive
[2636.04 - 2639.88] information and frequency and there's
[2638.20 - 2641.44] frequency within your voice there's
[2639.88 - 2643.78] frequency coming out of you there's
[2641.44 - 2646.78] frequency coming out of your body out of
[2643.78 - 2648.76] your soul all of it and the stones are
[2646.78 - 2652.42] absorbing that
[2648.76 - 2654.94] and then we throw the stones away into
[2652.42 - 2656.92] the water on the seventh day I did that
[2654.94 - 2659.20] this morning we throw them throw the
[2656.92 - 2662.44] stones back into nature and nature then
[2659.20 - 2665.20] eats up those emotions in a way that
[2662.44 - 2667.24] distance makes a distance between us
[2665.20 - 2668.86] different than if we went out to nature
[2667.24 - 2670.60] for a meditation or we went out to
[2668.86 - 2672.58] Nature to take a walk and clear our head
[2670.60 - 2676.06] and to actually
[2672.58 - 2678.40] change our own frequency when we got to
[2676.06 - 2681.28] Nature and we take a walk a hike we do a
[2678.40 - 2683.14] little run we go out there and meditate
[2681.28 - 2683.98] we listen to the birds we look at the
[2683.14 - 2686.08] water
[2683.98 - 2688.84] and we're doing that to help us heal
[2686.08 - 2691.96] right well what this does is the stones
[2688.84 - 2695.08] absorb a lot of that old hurt and then
[2691.96 - 2697.00] we let the stones go we pull the hurt
[2695.08 - 2699.22] further away from us when the hurt
[2697.00 - 2701.98] leaves the Stones The Hurt doesn't run
[2699.22 - 2704.08] back to us and recreate patterns we have
[2701.98 - 2706.78] this more of an empty space inside of us
[2704.08 - 2709.06] now for room for new experiences new
[2706.78 - 2711.46] references new positive experiences to
[2709.06 - 2713.32] fill back in on the void that was being
[2711.46 - 2715.42] taken over by all those stuff down
[2713.32 - 2719.82] emotions this whole time now we're
[2715.42 - 2719.82] sitting festering down deep inside
[2720.42 - 2726.46] mysticals Ms says I was unexpectedly in
[2723.22 - 2729.64] hospital last fall they took my blood at
[2726.46 - 2731.86] least twice per day as hemoglobin was
[2729.64 - 2733.84] low I said to a nurse maybe it would be
[2731.86 - 2736.06] better if they didn't take so much blood
[2733.84 - 2737.20] from me mystical Ms completely
[2736.06 - 2739.18] understand
[2737.20 - 2741.22] I've watched the industry bleed people
[2739.18 - 2744.46] to death but nobody accounts for it
[2741.22 - 2746.02] nobody talks about it nobody knows how
[2744.46 - 2747.70] much blood is taken from people when
[2746.02 - 2749.38] they're sick and then you go to a
[2747.70 - 2751.72] specialist and they take another 12
[2749.38 - 2753.52] vials then you go to another specialist
[2751.72 - 2754.96] they take another 12 vials wait a minute
[2753.52 - 2757.00] I'm not done
[2754.96 - 2759.28] then you go to a Lyme disease specialist
[2757.00 - 2761.86] and they take 40 vials
[2759.28 - 2765.82] do you know what happened to all of the
[2761.86 - 2769.00] early Lyme disease cases back in the 80s
[2765.82 - 2771.40] and back in the 90s they were bled
[2769.00 - 2773.32] sickness and then when they got sicker
[2771.40 - 2775.42] and sicker from their lime and from
[2773.32 - 2777.88] getting their blood draws they were bled
[2775.42 - 2781.84] more and bled more
[2777.88 - 2785.44] to Insanity to the death of many people
[2781.84 - 2788.76] to the death of many people
[2785.44 - 2788.76] very important to know
[2794.74 - 2801.06] it's terrifying Jackie B is terrifying
[2797.62 - 2801.06] exactly I concur
[2802.50 - 2808.56] smoking cigarettes was safe
[2805.18 - 2808.56] until it wasn't
[2809.86 - 2814.26] asbestos was safe until it wasn't
[2815.20 - 2818.92] thousands of pharmaceuticals were safe
[2817.30 - 2819.94] until they weren't and pulled off the
[2818.92 - 2822.96] market
[2819.94 - 2822.96] over the decades
[2823.24 - 2827.34] pesticides are safe till they weren't
[2829.90 - 2833.86] taking a ton of blood was safe until
[2832.18 - 2835.90] it's not
[2833.86 - 2838.72] cellular healing on IG says they took
[2835.90 - 2841.48] two vials wait a minute I almost said
[2838.72 - 2844.48]  I said
[2841.48 - 2848.38] cellular healing says they took 21 vials
[2844.48 - 2850.66] before I went into labor
[2848.38 - 2854.38] 21 vials
[2850.66 - 2854.38] before Labor
[2857.14 - 2862.72] so her healing says in a form of evil so
[2860.38 - 2864.64] you have to speak up for yourself it's a
[2862.72 - 2866.14] form of evil so you have to speak up for
[2864.64 - 2868.24] yourself you have to speak up for
[2866.14 - 2869.68] yourself and that's empowerment so what
[2868.24 - 2871.96] the haters don't realize about medical
[2869.68 - 2874.72] meeting medical meme information is its
[2871.96 - 2877.06] true empowerment for you to protect you
[2874.72 - 2878.38] I can't believe when I see it all the
[2877.06 - 2880.00] time but then I can believe it the
[2878.38 - 2882.46] haters I can believe the haters they're
[2880.00 - 2884.32] jealous right but you see the haters out
[2882.46 - 2886.42] there trying to rip down medical medium
[2884.32 - 2889.72] in any way possible you see it out there
[2886.42 - 2892.24] and you saw the attack on me
[2889.72 - 2894.28] not too long ago
[2892.24 - 2895.48] you see that
[2894.28 - 2897.46] right
[2895.48 - 2899.14] and medical medium information is
[2897.46 - 2900.58] telling people to protect themselves and
[2899.14 - 2902.32] Empower themselves so they don't get
[2900.58 - 2905.52] bled to death
[2902.32 - 2905.52] but they don't care
[2908.20 - 2914.14] Joe Catherine says they took blood from
[2910.18 - 2918.12] my very sick baby son until all of his
[2914.14 - 2918.12] veins had collapsed
[2918.52 - 2924.70] huge problem happening out there
[2922.54 - 2926.80] huge problem
[2924.70 - 2929.92] armett says I work in a children's
[2926.80 - 2935.26] hospital and off the Record advised my
[2929.92 - 2937.06] patients families to request half vials
[2935.26 - 2939.82] critical
[2937.06 - 2942.58] truly critical
[2939.82 - 2946.26] Infinite Wellness good to see you my
[2942.58 - 2946.26] lime doctor bled me dry
[2947.68 - 2952.90] tens of thousands of women were bled to
[2951.22 - 2955.06] death in the 80s
[2952.90 - 2958.18] from Lyme disease
[2955.06 - 2962.32] they didn't die
[2958.18 - 2964.48] from Lyme disease they were sick
[2962.32 - 2966.22] from live right and you know medical
[2964.48 - 2967.42] medium books talk about what causes lime
[2966.22 - 2970.62] they were sick
[2967.42 - 2970.62] they were never going to die
[2971.02 - 2974.32] meaning in that moment in their life in
[2973.06 - 2978.10] that condition in their life and that
[2974.32 - 2981.16] age in their life but they were bled
[2978.10 - 2984.04] to an endless sickness and to death for
[2981.16 - 2985.78] many of them that's the wake
[2984.04 - 2990.76] of the lime world
[2985.78 - 2993.10] there are authors and podcasts doctors
[2990.76 - 2995.68] that I won't name that were part of the
[2993.10 - 2997.78] LIE movement of bleeding women to death
[2995.68 - 3000.08] and nobody even knows this and knows
[2997.78 - 3000.08] their history
[3001.20 - 3004.62] the amount of information I know and
[3003.00 - 3006.12] what happened throughout alternative
[3004.62 - 3008.94] medicine is just would blow your
[3006.12 - 3011.58] freaking mind if you guys
[3008.94 - 3013.32] sat on a couch with me and had dinner at
[3011.58 - 3015.60] my house with my family and I told you
[3013.32 - 3018.48] what I knew in so many ways your heads
[3015.60 - 3021.78] would just explode
[3018.48 - 3023.76] he'd be like what that person that's out
[3021.78 - 3025.44] there well who oh my God your heads
[3023.76 - 3027.30] would just explode
[3025.44 - 3028.74] the thing is they don't have to take so
[3027.30 - 3032.10] much blood
[3028.74 - 3034.26] they don't have to take so much blood
[3032.10 - 3037.56] very important to know
[3034.26 - 3040.40] they only need to take a little drop
[3037.56 - 3040.40] I'll show you
[3042.78 - 3048.32] and I've showed this to you guys if you
[3044.52 - 3048.32] guys have known me for a long time
[3048.48 - 3054.60] the truth is is that little dot right
[3050.88 - 3058.14] there would give you a thyroid panel
[3054.60 - 3060.90] metabolism panel they call it
[3058.14 - 3063.36] a liver panel
[3060.90 - 3066.54] that in babies gives them a forgives
[3063.36 - 3069.36] baby's full thyroid panels
[3066.54 - 3072.06] diabetics don't even need a drop of
[3069.36 - 3075.78] blood down to check their sugar levels
[3072.06 - 3079.20] but only needed a drop tinier than this
[3075.78 - 3081.18] they can take a blood tinier than this a
[3079.20 - 3083.16] blood drop tinier than this off of a
[3081.18 - 3084.78] pair of jeans from a shallow grave from
[3083.16 - 3087.06] 1980 from somebody being murdered
[3084.78 - 3090.18] murdered and buried in the woods and
[3087.06 - 3092.76] they can go and scrape off a speck of
[3090.18 - 3094.62] old dried out blood
[3092.76 - 3096.12] and they can do a whole nutritional
[3094.62 - 3097.92] panel on it
[3096.12 - 3100.56] and don't ever get fooled by that whole
[3097.92 - 3102.78] BS thing that they need to do a serum
[3100.56 - 3105.30] that they need to do with serum that's
[3102.78 - 3108.12] not how it works
[3105.30 - 3110.88] Denise says I was told that the body
[3108.12 - 3113.82] replaces it in about four to five hours
[3110.88 - 3115.80] and that's probably the biggest line of
[3113.82 - 3118.10]  in the medical world I've ever
[3115.80 - 3118.10] heard
[3120.90 - 3125.52] is this waffle done let me get the blood
[3123.00 - 3129.44] off the cutting board if you guys don't
[3125.52 - 3129.44] mind you get it back in the fridge
[3134.82 - 3137.90] waffle number two
[3139.26 - 3143.28] meanwhile most people with symptoms have
[3141.60 - 3144.78] a low immune system or immune system
[3143.28 - 3147.06] problems
[3144.78 - 3148.86] their immune system doesn't come back in
[3147.06 - 3150.42] four to five hours could take weeks and
[3148.86 - 3152.76] could it take even months every time
[3150.42 - 3155.88] they draw the blood it could take months
[3152.76 - 3158.64] to get their immune system back on track
[3155.88 - 3160.56] their bones are struggling to produce it
[3158.64 - 3163.20] their bones are struggling they have to
[3160.56 - 3165.66] go into overload to produce all that
[3163.20 - 3169.40] immune cell
[3165.66 - 3169.40] look at that two waffles
[3170.06 - 3175.56] hog heaven without the hog
[3173.58 - 3178.02] the amount of stress on the body the
[3175.56 - 3180.66] electrolytes that are removed the
[3178.02 - 3182.58] um let's go check you for nutritional
[3180.66 - 3185.94] deficiencies
[3182.58 - 3188.52] and at the same time let's take 14 vials
[3185.94 - 3190.94] of blood or five vials of blood still
[3188.52 - 3194.40] too much let's take five vials of blood
[3190.94 - 3196.92] and remove all of your nutritional
[3194.40 - 3199.68] critical electrolytes trace minerals
[3196.92 - 3202.34] minerals immune cells let's just remove
[3199.68 - 3202.34] everything
[3203.22 - 3207.90] let me tell you something that's really
[3205.02 - 3210.00] important that'll blow your mind
[3207.90 - 3211.86] if you had a blood test right after a
[3210.00 - 3214.02] blood test
[3211.86 - 3216.06] okay check this out
[3214.02 - 3219.36] doctors won't do this no one will do
[3216.06 - 3221.22] this because it will literally show how
[3219.36 - 3223.14] sick the system really is and I'm not
[3221.22 - 3224.70] saying good doctors good doctors could
[3223.14 - 3227.28] be great doctors and just not know this
[3224.70 - 3229.20] that's not the problem check this out
[3227.28 - 3231.30] you can get a blood test for nutritional
[3229.20 - 3233.34] deficiencies and they take out five
[3231.30 - 3235.62] vials of blood
[3233.34 - 3237.42] and then if after they took those five
[3235.62 - 3239.40] vials of blood and they sent those five
[3237.42 - 3242.04] vials of blood out
[3239.40 - 3244.68] if that same day they took another five
[3242.04 - 3247.74] vials of blood you would see that the
[3244.68 - 3250.56] second round of blood would be truly
[3247.74 - 3253.56] deficient because the first round took
[3250.56 - 3255.36] so much critical parts of your supply
[3253.56 - 3258.42] your nutritional Supply that's how
[3255.36 - 3260.04] demented the whole thing really is
[3258.42 - 3262.02] all right what I'm going to do is I'm
[3260.04 - 3264.06] going to put my waffles here
[3262.02 - 3268.16] you guys okay with that
[3264.06 - 3268.16] whoa whoa don't roll away
[3277.44 - 3282.24] how's that
[3279.84 - 3284.70] Cara milch over there on YouTube what do
[3282.24 - 3286.62] you do if you lost three liters of blood
[3284.70 - 3288.90] still here
[3286.62 - 3292.20] but how do you repair yourself after
[3288.90 - 3295.88] losing that much blood so in so there's
[3292.20 - 3295.88] protocols in brain saver by the way
[3297.54 - 3301.86] even protocol protocols meaning
[3299.52 - 3304.32] protocols before blood tests protocols
[3301.86 - 3305.82] after blood work all of that so I'm
[3304.32 - 3306.96] going to do you guys is I'm going to
[3305.82 - 3310.40] slice
[3306.96 - 3310.40] this nectarine
[3310.68 - 3314.64] you don't have to do this
[3312.60 - 3316.08] I'm doing it but you don't have you know
[3314.64 - 3317.76] like this is just
[3316.08 - 3318.51] I have these really great nectarines
[3317.76 - 3321.30] right now
[3318.51 - 3323.52] [Music]
[3321.30 - 3325.20] oh crap
[3323.52 - 3328.14] I forgot
[3325.20 - 3331.32] we need to be deathly afraid of fruit
[3328.14 - 3333.54] like deathly afraid of nectarines that's
[3331.32 - 3336.24] right I'm that's right medical medium is
[3333.54 - 3339.48] so restrictive so like what am I doing
[3336.24 - 3341.28] I'm I'm poisoning you guys with fruit
[3339.48 - 3343.08] like what am I doing
[3341.28 - 3345.36] anyway I'm gonna slice up this nectarine
[3343.08 - 3347.94] heal infertility says now I know why I
[3345.36 - 3349.50] feel sick after a blood draw oh yeah
[3347.94 - 3351.66] and here's the problem if you're
[3349.50 - 3353.76] actually sick with a chronic illness and
[3351.66 - 3356.04] you don't recover fast enough from a
[3353.76 - 3357.90] blood draw check this out
[3356.04 - 3359.70] and you call the doctor and say look I'm
[3357.90 - 3361.44] feeling sick don't want you in for
[3359.70 - 3362.94] another line of blood for another blood
[3361.44 - 3364.50] draw and then ready for this you get
[3362.94 - 3365.70] sick or two weeks later because of that
[3364.50 - 3366.96] second round of blood and guess what
[3365.70 - 3368.88] you're now at a specialist office
[3366.96 - 3372.00] getting 24 vials of blood and now you're
[3368.88 - 3374.46] going downhill downhill fast they just
[3372.00 - 3375.96] need to take a lower amount of blood I
[3374.46 - 3378.38] talk about that all in the brain saver
[3375.96 - 3378.38] books
[3378.72 - 3382.58] so I'm going to do is I'm going to slice
[3388.62 - 3391.70] I'm gonna slice
[3392.30 - 3397.02] this here if you guys don't mind I'm
[3395.10 - 3400.44] gonna put that like that
[3397.02 - 3403.56] an IG Dale hodgin says like Anthony says
[3400.44 - 3407.58] they don't need loads of blood when at
[3403.56 - 3411.00] crime scenes for DNA profile
[3407.58 - 3413.10] one drop of blood at a crime scene
[3411.00 - 3415.26] would take care of a liver
[3413.10 - 3420.30] liver enzymes
[3415.26 - 3422.82] Billy Rubin all of it like thyroid panel
[3420.30 - 3427.58] um like you name it it would just take
[3422.82 - 3427.58] care of all that one stinking drop
[3430.50 - 3435.26] I'm gonna try to do it this way now I'm
[3432.06 - 3435.26] going to slice it different ways
[3436.65 - 3441.24] [Music]
[3437.94 - 3444.14] marja what an information
[3441.24 - 3444.14] wow
[3444.60 - 3447.66] I haven't talked about blood draw in a
[3446.34 - 3448.62] while it wasn't going to be a blood draw
[3447.66 - 3451.50] talk
[3448.62 - 3453.72] it just wasn't it's it's the seventh day
[3451.50 - 3455.28] the medical medium collecting Stones
[3453.72 - 3458.58] meditation Journey
[3455.28 - 3463.22] everybody's throwing their stones
[3458.58 - 3463.22] into nature letting go their stones
[3463.74 - 3466.82] can I have this
[3469.50 - 3471.50] um
[3475.62 - 3480.84] I'm Gonna Save this
[3477.78 - 3482.94] because I want to eat that part and then
[3480.84 - 3485.46] eat that part and then eat all the way
[3482.94 - 3486.90] around the pit
[3485.46 - 3488.94] good
[3486.90 - 3490.62] it's an insane nectarine nectarine
[3488.94 - 3494.22] season insane
[3490.62 - 3497.22] Alicia on YouTube the lab keeps saying
[3494.22 - 3499.14] if they take small amounts of blood that
[3497.22 - 3501.42] the patient needs to come back for more
[3499.14 - 3503.46] blood drawn because the lab can't run
[3501.42 - 3505.14] the test not true
[3503.46 - 3507.00] there are so many people who are so
[3505.14 - 3508.98] dehydrated and can they can't even get
[3507.00 - 3511.38] blood out of people and they take the
[3508.98 - 3514.82] smallest vial of blood
[3511.38 - 3518.22] it's just that that's how the scam works
[3514.82 - 3520.44] don't let it mess babies they take small
[3518.22 - 3522.00] vials and they run everything because
[3520.44 - 3525.00] they know better they know they can't
[3522.00 - 3526.86] take 12 large vials out of a baby
[3525.00 - 3528.78] because they'll kill the baby think
[3526.86 - 3530.88] about that so what they do is they take
[3528.78 - 3532.74] tiny baby vials in only a couple and
[3530.88 - 3534.84] they run all the same tests how do they
[3532.74 - 3536.46] do it you have to make a serum I don't
[3534.84 - 3539.42] understand it's a small amount of blood
[3536.46 - 3539.42] how does it work
[3542.72 - 3545.72] thank you
[3545.76 - 3550.20] I can ask myself questions all day long
[3548.10 - 3552.66] and I'll get the answers for it and it
[3550.20 - 3554.70] will be because the system is scamming
[3552.66 - 3556.92] people
[3554.70 - 3559.16] I'm just gonna throw one more waffle in
[3556.92 - 3559.16] here
[3560.10 - 3567.54] yoga love meditation on IG
[3564.12 - 3570.54] they took three vials to test for low
[3567.54 - 3574.86] iron and I fainted
[3570.54 - 3576.48] three full vials can do that for a lot
[3574.86 - 3578.28] of people
[3576.48 - 3579.42] they really need to do take quarter
[3578.28 - 3581.34] tubes
[3579.42 - 3582.78] two quarter tubes if the doctor says
[3581.34 - 3584.04] well we can only run these amount of
[3582.78 - 3585.60] tests with those two quarter tubes and
[3584.04 - 3587.22] you come back a couple weeks and you
[3585.60 - 3588.54] take two more quarter tubes right that's
[3587.22 - 3591.56] what I would do too
[3588.54 - 3591.56] if that's the case
[3593.04 - 3598.44] I have another waffle coming up I'm
[3595.62 - 3601.04] gonna try to make waffles that are a
[3598.44 - 3601.04] waffle that's

[3605.04 - 3608.72] it demands respect
[3609.66 - 3616.34] your blood is a life force that demands
[3613.74 - 3616.34] respect

[3623.34 - 3627.12] tell me
[3624.84 - 3629.52] where's it all gone sit through getting
[3627.12 - 3632.04] thrown out is it excuse for experiments

[3634.02 - 3636.36] it where they do what are they doing
[3635.10 - 3638.22] with all the blood
[3636.36 - 3640.26] Violet hummingbird says when I got my
[3638.22 - 3643.58] blood drawn the workers were dressed as
[3640.26 - 3643.58] vampires for Halloween
[3648.48 - 3651.86] I don't know why I'm laughing

[3693.18 - 3698.10] Max Vaughn says big drama here half hour
[3696.24 - 3701.28] before release time
[3698.10 - 3704.40] I dropped my smallest stone called anger
[3701.28 - 3707.64] and it rolled in a crack and I can't get
[3704.40 - 3710.10] it out all I could fish out was an old
[3707.64 - 3712.02] penny so that's that
[3710.10 - 3714.08] what
[3712.02 - 3714.08] what
[3717.20 - 3722.40] oh my God Lisa oh says on Facebook
[3720.48 - 3723.96] Anthony
[3722.40 - 3725.88] thank you for the stone collecting
[3723.96 - 3729.92] Journey so profound and healing thanks
[3725.88 - 3729.92] for cooking and inspiring us even more
[3732.30 - 3736.14] your stone fell into a tiny crack the
[3734.82 - 3738.06] anger Stone
[3736.14 - 3741.48] and you try to fish it out and the only
[3738.06 - 3743.40] thing you can fish out is an old penny
[3741.48 - 3744.42] there's got to be tremendous meaning in
[3743.40 - 3748.10] that
[3744.42 - 3748.10] tremendous meaning in that
[3760.50 - 3767.22] I know I'm speechless over that one I am
[3764.34 - 3769.46] because I'm asking SOC questions that's
[3767.22 - 3769.46] why
[3769.92 - 3773.24] I'm asking questions
[3778.28 - 3783.06] I got another waffle cooking if you guys
[3780.72 - 3784.02] don't mind we're live right now we're on
[3783.06 - 3785.82] day seven
[3784.02 - 3787.74] of the collecting Stones meditation
[3785.82 - 3790.74] journey I promise you this to be an
[3787.74 - 3793.38] experience that you'll never forget
[3790.74 - 3795.24] Elvis lives
[3793.38 - 3798.42] I love Elvis
[3795.24 - 3801.48] just released my jailhouse rocks
[3798.42 - 3805.26] let's rock explanation points everybody
[3801.48 - 3807.54] let's rock so you're an Elvis fan
[3805.26 - 3810.42] call it in a trap
[3807.54 - 3813.18] you're an Elvis fan
[3810.42 - 3815.84] I can't walk out
[3813.18 - 3815.84] all right
[3819.48 - 3824.64] educating myself good to see you my
[3822.42 - 3827.06] anger Stone spontaneously exploded laugh
[3824.64 - 3827.06] out loud
[3833.94 - 3837.96] I'm laughing a little bit but I'm not
[3836.28 - 3840.30] going into that whole like laugh attack
[3837.96 - 3841.50] thing thank God or you know I hit the
[3840.30 - 3843.60] floor
[3841.50 - 3845.94] remember that happened on the Amazon
[3843.60 - 3848.22] live a long time ago when I hit the I I
[3845.94 - 3850.20] hit the floor I was laughing so hard I
[3848.22 - 3851.54] couldn't I was rolling around on the
[3850.20 - 3854.64] floor
[3851.54 - 3857.10] Elaine says on YouTube they took three
[3854.64 - 3859.62] vials of blood from my daughter when she
[3857.10 - 3861.84] was about 10 years old and she hardly
[3859.62 - 3863.70] weighed anything she almost immediately
[3861.84 - 3866.34] vomited afterwards from the drastic
[3863.70 - 3868.50] changes it created
[3866.34 - 3871.74] hemorrhagic shock
[3868.50 - 3873.06] that's what I said I said hemorrhage
[3871.74 - 3874.74] um
[3873.06 - 3877.20] even the thing is is I talk about this
[3874.74 - 3879.00] in the brain saver books what determines
[3877.20 - 3881.28] hemorrhagic shock
[3879.00 - 3882.90] what determines it because science
[3881.28 - 3884.40] doesn't really know they're like well
[3882.90 - 3885.84] when most of the blood is drained out of
[3884.40 - 3887.34] your body that's pretty much when you go
[3885.84 - 3889.02] into hemorrhagic shock well really
[3887.34 - 3890.76] because there's people that go and
[3889.02 - 3892.08] donate blood and they're in hemorrhagic
[3890.76 - 3894.30] shock and they can't even get out of the
[3892.08 - 3896.22] chair they're in shock for weeks and
[3894.30 - 3898.26] weeks
[3896.22 - 3899.94] they barely can get them home in some
[3898.26 - 3901.56] apple juice in a cookie it doesn't cut
[3899.94 - 3905.18] it
[3901.56 - 3905.18] Michelle says love Elvis too
[3905.76 - 3909.02] respect respect
[3909.30 - 3914.58] marja says Dr Nesbitt came and helped

[3949.38 - 3955.46] the maple syrup on them yet I wanted to
[3951.72 - 3955.46] give it a little time before I do that
[3956.28 - 3961.76] you guys are at my kitchen
[3958.56 - 3961.76] I am at your service
[3962.10 - 3967.86] a mattress service marja says I release

[3978.96 - 3983.40] a lot I release my storage into a creek
[3981.06 - 3985.92] that I didn't know existed close to my
[3983.40 - 3989.04] place they guided me there I got back
[3985.92 - 3992.96] into my car and the song Freedom from
[3989.04 - 3992.96] George Michael was playing on the radio
[3993.12 - 3999.36] that's incredible
[3995.84 - 4000.74] loan over here on Facebook says I had a
[3999.36 - 4003.56] difference in my thoughts immediately
[4000.74 - 4006.02] after letting them go I don't think like
[4003.56 - 4009.50] I used to
[4006.02 - 4011.48] I had a extremely personal experience
[4009.50 - 4013.76] when I
[4011.48 - 4015.56] put my stones out there and yes one of
[4013.76 - 4017.84] the stones almost hit a turtle
[4015.56 - 4021.34] but it didn't hit the turtle
[4017.84 - 4021.34] it did not hit the turtle
[4021.56 - 4026.12] it almost hit the turtle and I was like
[4024.02 - 4028.36] whoa
[4026.12 - 4028.36] oh
[4031.52 - 4034.48] didn't hit the turtle
[4034.70 - 4041.48] Kimmy said my four day old newborn had
[4038.78 - 4046.04] so much blood taken to test
[4041.48 - 4049.34] oh my God for galactosemia it was the
[4046.04 - 4051.38] worst 18 hours of my life watching it
[4049.34 - 4054.04] unfold
[4051.38 - 4054.04] kills me
[4054.14 - 4056.74] it does
[4062.30 - 4066.50] the blood draw information is just one
[4064.34 - 4068.72] example of mm information you could be
[4066.50 - 4070.34] plant-based but not MediCal medium
[4068.72 - 4072.68] plant-based you could be animal based
[4070.34 - 4074.42] and not MediCal medium animal based
[4072.68 - 4076.52] you can say you're doing medical medium
[4074.42 - 4077.84] and not even really do medical medium I
[4076.52 - 4079.52] know that some people do that out there
[4077.84 - 4081.44] they do one little thing at one point
[4079.52 - 4082.76] and then they say I tried medical media
[4081.44 - 4084.14] but they really didn't even read the
[4082.76 - 4086.80] books there's so many different
[4084.14 - 4086.80] situations
[4087.02 - 4092.00] Ardent over there in Facebook says I
[4089.78 - 4094.04] collapsed after donating blood and never
[4092.00 - 4095.36] again exclamation point was tired for
[4094.04 - 4097.64] weeks afterwards
[4095.36 - 4100.70] people sick should not donate blood
[4097.64 - 4105.38] meaning like it's not it's too hard on
[4100.70 - 4107.72] the body and they only the the 98 of
[4105.38 - 4111.26] blood roughly around that that number
[4107.72 - 4114.56] depending on what year the majority of
[4111.26 - 4116.90] people donating blood are sick women
[4114.56 - 4118.34] because you're told to donate blood by
[4116.90 - 4121.88] their doctors
[4118.34 - 4123.08] and organizations they send women who
[4121.88 - 4124.64] are struggling and suffering with
[4123.08 - 4127.22] sickness and chronic illness to donate
[4124.64 - 4128.36] blood that's who's donating blood it's
[4127.22 - 4130.22] not all the people that are walking
[4128.36 - 4131.96] around fine and they're not suffering
[4130.22 - 4135.08] from chronic illness yet they're not
[4131.96 - 4137.12] told to donate blood it's literally all
[4135.08 - 4138.56] the women who are sick being told to
[4137.12 - 4141.26] donate blood
[4138.56 - 4143.80] does that make any sense to you
[4141.26 - 4143.80] oh
[4146.18 - 4151.16] Dr Fawn says yet if you create a company
[4148.52 - 4153.20] that can do many tests from a drop of
[4151.16 - 4156.14] blood you'll end up in jail and
[4153.20 - 4158.54] character assassinated correct you also
[4156.14 - 4159.80] help to heal millions of people around
[4158.54 - 4161.72] the world right with medical medium
[4159.80 - 4165.16] books and information you also get

[4252.62 - 4257.24] the Samara says on IG it gives me
[4255.14 - 4260.08] anxiety to read some people on Instagram
[4257.24 - 4262.58] questioning and bashing mm do they ever
[4260.08 - 4265.70] just really mean
[4262.58 - 4267.80] mean for people trying to heal it is and
[4265.70 - 4269.60] that's why they do it because they're
[4267.80 - 4271.76] mean-hearted mean-spirited they don't
[4269.60 - 4274.70] give up about anyone
[4271.76 - 4277.10] they don't like me

[4619.70 - 4622.84] We're All in This Together
[4623.12 - 4628.76] there's something that happens when we
[4626.00 - 4630.68] release these stones
[4628.76 - 4632.96] all jokes aside
[4630.68 - 4635.50] all kidding aside
[4632.96 - 4635.50] okay
[4638.84 - 4644.84] we carry baggage
[4641.66 - 4646.82] we do suitcases
[4644.84 - 4649.88] of baggage
[4646.82 - 4652.52] some smaller suitcases some bigger
[4649.88 - 4654.86] suitcases but we
[4652.52 - 4657.80] in order to survive here on Earth we
[4654.86 - 4659.30] stuff stuff down we say sometimes oh I'm
[4657.80 - 4662.86] just gonna let it roll off my back but
[4659.30 - 4662.86] it doesn't mean it rolled off your back
[4663.68 - 4668.84] and there's that phrase where people say
[4666.92 - 4669.92] I can forgive but I'm never going to
[4668.84 - 4671.30] forget
[4669.92 - 4673.52] you're never going to forget because
[4671.30 - 4676.40] that wound is actually in the soul it's
[4673.52 - 4679.10] actually a part of you now it travels
[4676.40 - 4681.86] with us when we leave here
[4679.10 - 4684.62] when we leave here
[4681.86 - 4687.38] this is an opportunity
[4684.62 - 4689.66] to start drawing some of that out of us
[4687.38 - 4691.04] so when we name those three stones and
[4689.66 - 4692.42] we make that connection with those three
[4691.04 - 4694.82] stones and those three stones have
[4692.42 - 4696.80] chosen us or we chose them or they chose
[4694.82 - 4699.80] us or we chose them
[4696.80 - 4702.38] those stones are absorbing that wound
[4699.80 - 4705.32] that information no scars and absorbing
[4702.38 - 4707.24] that and then we get to day seven and in
[4705.32 - 4709.70] that day seven it's time and we release
[4707.24 - 4713.02] those stones back out to Nature we
[4709.70 - 4713.02] release them back out there
[4714.50 - 4717.40] and those stones
[4717.44 - 4723.26] that were your friends all along that
[4720.32 - 4726.38] did not judge you did not make fun of
[4723.26 - 4728.72] you weren't mean to you
[4726.38 - 4729.80] they were there they were conduits they
[4728.72 - 4732.92] were
[4729.80 - 4736.10] sponges to absorb any pain suffering
[4732.92 - 4737.96] along the way Old Wounds to clear a
[4736.10 - 4739.76] space inside of us because when that
[4737.96 - 4742.40] space is filled up with all that hurts
[4739.76 - 4744.32] it's hard to press forward without being
[4742.40 - 4746.36] triggered and we get stuck in patterns
[4744.32 - 4750.08] so what I'm trying to say is those
[4746.36 - 4752.72] stones are the pattern Breakers
[4750.08 - 4755.50] come on we throw those stones away the
[4752.72 - 4758.78] stones take
[4755.50 - 4762.08] that hurt and that hurt doesn't come
[4758.78 - 4764.06] rushing back into you because it's
[4762.08 - 4766.16] thrown in the air it's attached to the
[4764.06 - 4767.48] Stones it's in the Stones it's absorbed
[4766.16 - 4768.32] into those minerals and when those
[4767.48 - 4771.40] stones
[4768.32 - 4771.40] go flying
[4773.12 - 4779.08] and hit that water or hit those woods or
[4776.60 - 4784.04] hit that nature
[4779.08 - 4787.76] boom it's already neutralizing
[4784.04 - 4790.46] already being diffused
[4787.76 - 4792.68] and unable to rush back to us if you're
[4790.46 - 4795.08] bedridden and you cannot release these
[4792.68 - 4797.18] stones of yours have someone else do it
[4795.08 - 4799.28] for you and if you can't do it on the
[4797.18 - 4801.08] day seven that's okay if you're someone
[4799.28 - 4803.24] who's bedridden if somebody who's you
[4801.08 - 4804.86] get so many you've been compromised in
[4803.24 - 4806.00] so many ways you've been injured or
[4804.86 - 4807.74] you've been suffering or struggling
[4806.00 - 4809.66] you're just too sick right now in the
[4807.74 - 4811.10] moment to get up and go somewhere or you
[4809.66 - 4812.90] don't have a way to travel and get
[4811.10 - 4815.30] somewhere have somebody else release
[4812.90 - 4816.68] your stones for you it's okay and if it
[4815.30 - 4820.06] can't happen today that's all right
[4816.68 - 4820.06] we're doing another day
[4821.48 - 4827.98] singing sweetly says can I start again
[4823.82 - 4827.98] tomorrow I have lots of baggage
[4828.08 - 4834.02] give it a couple days give it a couple
[4830.48 - 4836.72] days give it a week give it a little
[4834.02 - 4838.22] time to just let what happened happen
[4836.72 - 4840.56] because things are going to surface
[4838.22 - 4841.94] feelings are going to happen Sears gonna
[4840.56 - 4845.30] sense healing you're going to sense
[4841.94 - 4847.58] healing emotionally give it a chance to
[4845.30 - 4848.72] sense it to feel it give it a chance for
[4847.58 - 4851.98] it to happen

[4868.76 - 4873.92] that's flowing across the Earth
[4871.16 - 4878.12] that's going down the street
[4873.92 - 4880.16] and the rain that's coming from above
[4878.12 - 4882.56] all of that
[4880.16 - 4887.62] will eventually
[4882.56 - 4887.62] hit the stones and help neutralize them
[4891.26 - 4894.02] a lot of people aren't going to want to
[4892.64 - 4896.18] release stones
[4894.02 - 4899.38] but it's a good day to release them if
