you're listening to the medical medium

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,080

the most advanced healing information

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,759

is not found anywhere else and it's

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,120
decades ahead of what's out there now

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
and that that just reminded me about

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,920
something you guys that you know back

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,000
when back a few decades ago and just

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,840
even even not even a few decades ago

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
let's just go two decades ago the

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,960
internet wasn't in it you know it wasn't

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,879
in that stage it was in obviously if

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,879
there was even an internet at that time

20
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,680
and you know when someone was sick when

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
someone was sick and they had symptoms

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
they had like fatigue or they couldn't

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,320
function well or they had a weak

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,080
sensitive central nervous system or they

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,479
had vertigo balance issues being dizzy

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,479
um anything of that sort they weren't

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,920
well for some reason sinus infections

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,280
chronically chronic UTI mystery symptoms

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
aches and pains neuralgia you know

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,400
tingles and numbness the list goes on

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
migraines all unexplainable all mystery

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,680
when someone had all that there was

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,479
really no support system it didn't exist

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,560
if you walked into a

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
drugstore you couldn't get eation this

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,640
is hysterical you know I purposely

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,479
walked into a drugstore a long time ago

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,880
and this is decades ago I walked into

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,159
the drugstore to look at the vitamins

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,479
see if they had vitamins in the

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,240
drugstore and they had at the time you

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,119
know two major company vitamins you

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,840
probably know who they are right I'm not

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
going to mention any names and they're

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,640
just sitting on the shelf there and I

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,920
went to the pharmacist I said do you

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,520
guys have any eonia and they laughed at

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,600
at me they laughed at me literally

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,280
laughed me out of the

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,200
pharmacy okay I'm just telling you right

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,160
now and okay sure this is 25 30 years

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,760
ago but I'm telling you right now laugh

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,920
me out of the pharmacy think about that

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,440
for a minute okay and that wasn't just

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,680
there it was it was Nationwide like that

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,319
so what does that tell you just that

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,840
alone so when you were sick back then

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,200
with anything and some of you many of

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
you probably experienced it were are you

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,239
kidding I mean that's the whole point if

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,800
you were sick back then with

62
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,319
anything good luck good luck now you

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,640
would think things are actually better

64
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,159
now we have the internet thank God we

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,959
have all these different things thank

66
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,480
God okay and and you know we have

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,560
communication you think things would be

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,360
better now now you had all these fancy

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
books out we got experts everywhere but

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,599
chronic illness is

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,599
quadrupling forget quadruple it's it's

72
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,760
way past that it's way past it it's it's

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,799
by 10 it's by 15 times past it tripling

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,799
doubling doubling times five it that's

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,799
where chronic illness is going and

76
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,640
everybody's got a symptom you may know

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,000
people you may know family members you

78
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,080
you may know friends you may know loved

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,599
ones you may know anybody that's got a

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,440
problem that's got something and here's

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
the problem the problem is there's the

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,239
misinformation that's out there both

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
conventionally and alternatively it's

84
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,360
riddled in there everywhere so the iCal

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
medium radio show we're clearing that up

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,200
that's the whole point you stay with me

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
for the ride we're going to clear up

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,159
each each show we're going to just just

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,159
move forward all together we're going to

90
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,799
work together on this because I've said

91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,480
it before in some of the last shows I

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,360
need your help too to get the

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
information out there so you can help

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,799
and spread that and spread it to your

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,280
family and help people and help a friend

96
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,959
or a stranger that you run into because

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,079
it's incredible when that occurs because

98
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,439
you offer assistance just by accident

99
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,280
also just by just just being it just

100
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,000
starts to happen and the world starts to

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,640
change but back then forget it you get

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,799
chronic fatigue syndrome you're just

103
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,599
you're you're just stupid that's all

104
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,159
you're just stupid if it's something

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
that can't be tested for and measured

106
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,480
you're just you're just stupid that's

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,759
how bad it was it's still that bad in

108
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,000
other ways we're still in these weird

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,840
places now a lot of misinformation a lot

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,160
of trouble we're still we're still the

111
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,440
reason why is because we're dealing with

112
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Antiquities we're dealing with antique

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,800
tests antique information even with a

114
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,240
Best Equipment the best functional

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,759
equipment but you know the best

116
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,880
alternative you name it we're still in

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,759
the Dark Ages so we have to clear this

118
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,360
up because you don't have 10 years I

119
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,280
don't have 10 years we don't have 20

120
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,280
years I don't have 30 years to wait for

121
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,600
answers life is precious and it has to

122
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,199
be cleared up now and that's what we're

123
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,039
doing okay so today's show we're talking

132
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,720
bels on for sure okay for this one cuz

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,520
grains is a big topic and I don't mean

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,840
greens I'm not saying greens okay I'm

135
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,440
saying grains all right we're going to

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,639
talk about these grains it's really

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,840
important um so I'm excited so let's

138
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,880
let's talk about this hey you know and

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
and look remember there's an LA event

140
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,720
coming up Los Angeles there's an event

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,560
coming up I'm really excited for it

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,240
because since I was young when Spirit

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,720
was talking to me and still does of

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,319
course and I hear Spirit perfectly clear

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,319
and I diagnose my grandmother of lung

146
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,639
cancer after that you know after that

147
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,160
and growing up a little bit I asked

148
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,840
Spirit what more can I do what more can

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,440
I do for everyone I saw the suffering

150
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,560
Spirit was telling me everything that

151
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,280
was wrong with everybody I remember

152
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,840
being at this convention with my parents

153
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,680
and I was 8 years old and I was at this

154
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,280
convention and you know and I was it was

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,160
really crowded and anyone who knows me

156
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,919
or knows anything about me knows that I

157
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,520
go blind when I'm around too many people

158
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,400
that's why at the events I practically

159
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,400
fall off the stage it's it's actually

160
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,599
kind of humorous and embarrassing at the

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
same time because the more readings I do

162
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,639
it's it's why I have an assistant come

163
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,800
with me everywhere it's why I have to go

164
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,759
on the plane with my assistant because

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,759
150 passengers on the plane I'm going to

166
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,800
get readings for every last one of them

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,000
there's no break there's no relaxing

168
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,120
there's no going on a cruise and one

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
medium said to me oh that that's that's

170
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,639
I I could I can't shut it off either

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,720
that's not true because I see everybody

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,759
going on cruises I see everybody having

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,840
fun everybody taking vacations trust me

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,039
everybody can shut it down enough I

175
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,680
can't shut it down and so the

176
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,319
information's going to come nonstop it's

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,680
always been like like this I'm going to

178
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,000
know if someone's got a brain tumor on

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
the plane I'm going to know if somebody

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,560
walking by's got diabetes I'm going to

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,759
know if someone's got this and what

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,080
happens though is because of that I'm

183
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,599
forced to scan and I'm forced to hear

184
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,560
spirit and I start going blind so I go

185
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,160
almost permanently like mostly blind

186
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,440
depending on the situation and how many

187
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,000
people so at the events it gets kind of

188
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,759
funny so I asked so what happened when I

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,479
was younger I asked people you know I

190
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,240
mean I asked Spirit sorry about this I

191
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
asked Spirit what can I do what else can

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,639
I do and I remember being at a

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,639
convention with my family and it was

194
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,840
crowded it was mobbed and I was getting

195
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,560
the readings Non-Stop Non-Stop and I

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,479
came across this one person who was

197
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,840
really suffering just suffering really

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,879
bad had some terrible things going on

199
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,599
when I mean terrible means you know when

200
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,039
I looked inside the body I saw

201
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,840
everything wrong that was imaginable and

202
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,280
I was like how is this person even

203
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,319
standing and I said to Spirit what can I

204
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,520
do and spirit says let's do the light

205
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,280
blast let's do the light technique I'll

206
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,840
send down spirit said to me I'll send

207
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,879
down light on the crown of the person's

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,120
head full throttle

209
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,280
you just work with me on it and let's do

210
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,440
it we sent the light down on the person

211
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,879
and then I started doing it to everybody

213
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,520

hear it from everybody and there are are

274
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,040
answers to this question there are but

275
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,680
first we have to explore some

276
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,839
misunderstandings we have to explore

277
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,200
some misunder understandings are you

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,079
guys open for that are we going to do

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,399
that I'm just going to sip a little bit

280
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,920
of this tea right

281
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,040
here it's a grainfree

282
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,720
tea

283
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,200
um all right so here's the deal we have

284
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,480
to understand something about autoimmune

285
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,920
we have to we have to visit the

286
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,240
autoimmune topic I know I drive you guys

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,639
crazy sometimes with it but it's one of

288
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,720
the greatest mistakes of all time it's

289
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:12,360
the greatest mistake next to

290
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,320
nuclear nuclear weapons that are out

291
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,560
there sitting in bunkers okay this is

292
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:22,240
this is the next greatest mistake of all

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,440
history and of all time on the planet

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,959
and it's the confusion of autoimmune

295
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,000
where conventional and alternative

296
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,600
doctors and

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,240
practitioners believe that autoimmune is

298
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,000
the body attacking itself this could

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,959
never be more wrong than ever before

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
this happened due to the fact that

301
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,720
modern medicine doesn't know what's

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
wrong with someone and what's causing

303
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,639
their lupus symptoms their Celiac

304
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,839
problem their their um colitis problem

305
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,519
with their intestinal tract their

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
Hashimoto thyroiditis and and Medicine

307
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,040
Medical Research Medical Science doesn't

308
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
know what causes it so guess who takes

309
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,360
the blame you your body takes the blame

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,639
100% that's the easiest way out the

311
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,000
greatest way out for medical denial it's

312
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
the greatest way so you feel like crap

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,880
you feel like your body's attacking

314
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
itself you feel like your body's

315
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,360
betraying you you like the way that

316
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,720
feels I don't I don't like the way that

317
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,760
feels I had someone tell me someone tell

318
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,839
me who just you know believes in

319
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,360
alternative medicine you know enough and

320
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,240
believes in you know conventional

321
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,480
medicine but very this person's very

322
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,240
like you know um what is it black and

323
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,560
white in many ways or whatever which is

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,959
totally cool I'm not saying that's bad

325
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,279
and and this person's just like you know

326
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,279
no no medical science medical research

327
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,959
understands they know what autoimmune is

328
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,880
and I'm like no they don't they don't

329
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,160
know what it is it's not the body

330
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,680
attacking itself and they're like well

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,600
well of course it is and I'm like no of

332
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,760
course it's not of course it's not what

333
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,480
happens is with hosoo thyroiditis your

334
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,040
thyroid gets inflamed because there's a

335
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
pathogen called Epstein bar which I

336
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,000
brought to the attention to the world

337
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,399
years ago and I'm bringing attention to

338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,320
the world now and and we can fact check

339
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,399
it we could backdate it I brought that

340
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,639
to the world and you're hearing it here

341
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360

causes hasim modus thyroiditis all stems

345
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,040
from me with the information brought

346
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,040
from Spirit I'm boasting on that but

347
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,079
it's a fact so you know that any new any

348
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,680
new people logging into this show today

349
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,720

350
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,279
important to know so I want you to stay

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,920
tuned for further shows so you get

352
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:33,120
information that's moving people forward

353
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,880
information that's Advanced and so it's

354
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,639
what what happens is autoimmune is just

355
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,480
the body producing anti Auto antibodies

356
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,160
and antibodies to attack the virus not

357
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,040
the body not the physical body not the

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,880
physical organs they're not being

359
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,320
attacked at all in fact your body is

360
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,199
working handin hand to get rid of a

361
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,440
pathogen that's inflaming you so hear me

362
00:13:54,199 --> 00:14:01,759
out a pathogen virus like Hashimoto

363
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,800
thyroid itis it's a virus inflaming the

364
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,720
thyroid the virus is inflaming the

365
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,040
thyroid not the body the body's not

366
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,360
inflaming the the thyroid it's a virus

367
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,880
it's Epstein bar same thing with all

368
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,959
these other different autoimmune things

369
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,120
rheumatoid arthritis is a virus

370
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:20,160
inflaming the joints and the body is

371
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,560
trying to stop it and inflammation is

372
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,519
created by the pathogen inflaming the

373
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,240
joints and if you don't look if you want

374
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,680
to know more about this you you get the

375
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,320
medical medium book to be with and then

376
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,759
you know I talk about even more in

377
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,279
life-changing foods but what happens

378
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,800
here is that this confusion is one of

379
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,720
the worst of all time it really is I

380
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,600
could go into a lot of other ones too

381
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,160
but this one's one of the worst because

382
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,399
it breaks down your immune system and

383
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,120
messes you up messes you up because if

384
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,320
you think your body's attacking itself

385
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,399
you don't stand a chance you don't stand

386
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,279
a chance it's like like that's saying a

387
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,040
snowball's chance in hell or whatever it

388
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,160
is whatever it is you're not going to

389
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,160
stand a

390
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,440
chance so you have to rewire that right

391
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,160
now bam it's rewired I'm telling you so

392
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,000
it's important to know your body doesn't

393
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,440
attack itself and I'm not talking about

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,079
it on a spiritual way I'm talking on a

395
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,800
physical way I'm talking about science

396
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,560
that's not discovered that way that's

397
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,360
how I'm talking about it right here okay

398
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,279
and so the bottom line is is we have to

399
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,560
you have to adopt that you have to make

400
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,079
that a belief system you're going to

401
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,079
have to make that part of a factual

402
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,880
belief system because what happens is

403
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,240
autoimmune is really now wrapped up with

404
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,279
the grain thing grains you guys know

405
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,000
what I'm talking about you do right it's

406
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,920
all about grains causing autoimmune

407
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,279
grains causing inflammation that's not

408
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,279
accurate either that's not accurate at

409
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,800
all so wheat causing inflammation that's

410
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,600
not accurate at all I don't care if it's

411
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,800
the best newest autoimmune book that hit

412
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,839
the Shelf just recently or coming up or

413
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,000
whatever it is if it doesn't realize it

414
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
in that book or whoever's writing that

415
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,319
or doing whatever or talking on some

416
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,440
podcast if they don't realize it's the

417
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:24,680
wheat feeding a

418
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,399
pathogen such as a virus or bacteria and

419
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,120
that virus and bacteria eats the wheat

420
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,600
and then eliminates a

421
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,279
toxin or the virus and the pathogen eat

422
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,639
the wheat and grow stronger and cause

423
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:43,000
more damage that's the truth if no one

424
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
has that in their their books yet which

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,720
they don't we look out for that stuff

426
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,959
cuz we want everybody moving forward we

427
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
want people to know the truth then you

428
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,399
know what you're dealing with something

429
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000

430
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,880

is because Anthony's got all the answers

438
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,120
no this is just how it works what

439
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,880
happens is there's people out there that

440
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,199

Wheat and they're not getting inflamed I

464
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,159
know because I do scans I don't see any

465
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,320
inflammation and they're not complaining

466
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,039

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,159
fibromyalgia they're not complaining of

470
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,919
anything because they're lacking one

471
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,960
thing they're lacking the pathogen that

472
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,440
feeds off of something that's what

473
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,240
they're lacking do you see how it works

474
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,919

you're with me here because this is how

478
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,919
it works I mean do you know somebody

479
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,480
that's feeling good and they could eat

480
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,760
they could eat a chocolate cake just

481
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,760
filled with wheat and just throw some

482
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,640
lard in there too throw throw also MSG

483
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,799
in there too whatever you know throw

484
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,760
anything you want in there that fondant

485
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,440
that's on chocolate cake just filled

486
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,159
with God knows what weak gluten it's

487
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,440
100% weak gluten or whatever it is with

488
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:04,720
sugar pasted in it so you know and um

489
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,320
and that's how that's what I'm talking

490
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,440
about and it's like uh you know and so

491
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,679
here's the deal the deal is it's not the

492
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,760
wheat I'm not saying the wheat's good

493
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,240
and I'm going to cover that I'm going to

494
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,840
cover that and talk about what grains to

495
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,919
avoid what grains you know if you do

496
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,120
like you can have some I'm going to talk

497
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,480
about that so don't get me wrong I'm not

498
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,640
the pro weak guy I'm not the pro weat

499
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,360
guy I don't want anybody eating wheat

500
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm just telling you it's not what

501
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,600
causes the inflammation those books are

502
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,559
outdated I want them updated that's why

503
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm complaining I want them updated

504
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,520
that's what I want the reason why is

505
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
because like I said before we got the

506
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,880
internet now but there's still the wrong

507
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,000
information out there we got communities

508
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,960
but they're dealing with the wrong

509
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,360
information and people are still sick

510
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,280
staying sick and getting sicker and

511
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,679
sicker and sicker and like I said at one

512
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,240
show it's an epidemic but it's an epic

513
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,200
demic it's an epidemic and that's what

514
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,679
we're dealing with all all around you

515
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,200
guys that's what we're dealing with you

516
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,200
know you know you see it so so here's

517
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,080
the deal let's let's talk about grains

518
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,440
for a little bit let's go back down into

519
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,240
history a little bit too which is kind

520
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,159
of funny back in

521
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,880
the80s the the deal was sprouted wheat

522
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,400

got quinoa pasta whatever you know and

542
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
then you got corn you got all this corn

543
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,080
stuff as well and we're going to talk

544
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,840
about that too because corn is corn is a

545
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,960
grain as well corn is a grain as well so

546
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,200
you know people think it's a vegetable

547
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,360
um so we're going to we got to fix that

548
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,320
you know I heard somebody tell me

549
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,640
recently no Corn's a vegetable I'm like

550
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,480
no no no Corn's a grain and they're like

551
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,880
no it can't be I don't no I promise you

552
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,360
it's a grain and so that's you know

553
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
that's another thing to talk about we're

554
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,480
going to but back then all you had was

555
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,200
that sprouted wheat bread now we got

556
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,600
better options we got better grains too

557
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,159
you know singled out if you want to you

558
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
know get yourself some like organic

559
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,520
Millet you want to get yourself some

560
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,799
quinoa so we got different grains and

561
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,120
everything but back to the autoimmune

562
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:51,080
thing the great maake autoimmune just

563
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,120
back to that so if we eat something that

564
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,240
feeds a condition you know a pathogen

565
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,480
that's in us we get

566
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,039
inflammation I've been telling people

567
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,600
for years you eat eggs you're going to

568
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,200
get more Hashimoto because the obsin bar

569
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,240
and the thyroid that causes hasim Hashi

570
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,720
sorry Hashimoto thyroiditis the Epstein

571
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,640
bar in the thyroid that feeds off of

572
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,440
eggs so it eats the eggs and then it you

573
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,559
know and then it grows nodul you grow

574
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,640
nodules in your thyroid it creates cyst

575
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,679
in your thyroid it can create thyroid

576
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,559
cancer the Epstein bar can even create

577
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,480
thyroid cancer I'm the one who brought

578
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,240
the fact that thyroid cancer is caused

579
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,039
by Epstein bar um that's that

580
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,480
information Spirit and I brought to town

581
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,600
too and and also breast cancer is caused

582
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,000
by Epstein bar as well and guess what

583
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,559
now they're starting to finally bring it

584
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,039
out medical research and medical science

585
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,360
is talking about it for the first time

586
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,799
in history um um I've been talking about

587
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,400
Epstein bar um creating breast cancer

588
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:51,559
for over 30 years so anyway the bottom

589
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,400
line is is that you know these pathogens

590
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,200
they feed off of the eggs they feed off

591
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,720
of the wheat when it comes down to the

592
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,440
grains it feeds off the

593
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,240
corn that's what happens there so these

594
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,240
grains certain grains can feed a

595
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,360
pathogen and that's why it's all these

596
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,679
diet gluten-free diet books they're like

597
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,880
oh the autoimmune diet oh this

598
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,720
autoimmune you know no

599
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,159
actually it's really should be kind of

600
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,960
redone and refixed because the stuff is

601
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,760
outdated it's a pathogen feeding off of

602
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,080
the wheat this is why someone can eat

603
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,679
cupcakes every morning you know for like

604
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,159
50 years and not have a problem I've

605
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:38,400
seen this over and over again but times

606
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,559
are changing times are changing and

607
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,200
there's less people pathogen free

608
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:48,200
there's less people free of of viruses

609
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,919
less people free of bacteria you guys

610
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,559
and the less people there are that means

611
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,799
we're you know we're we're seeing

612
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,120
dinosaurs now people were you know

613
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,320
dinosaurs where you know they're they're

614
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,679
the last of the the breed that can eat

615
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,080
what they want and not have a problem

616
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,520
and then there's some rare young you

617
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,880
know young ones that are rare and they

618
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,360
can do it too right now but it's

619
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,799
becoming less and less and less because

620
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,400
we got people filled with more radiation

621
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,080
more toxic heavy metals plot lots of

622
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,480
pathogens you know utilizing it all and

623
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,080
then utilizing the Grain and this is why

624
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
grain doesn't

625
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,240
work so what grains are good what grains

626
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
are bad first of all if you're dealing

627
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,279
with any condition or any symptom you

628
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,159
want to keep wheat out chances are the

629
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,360
wheat's feeding something and when it's

630
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,120
feeding something that something is

631
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,600
creating a problem whatever that could

632
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,240
be when it's strep

633
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,600
related so that strep strepa cacus

634
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,039
feeding off of grain causing more sinus

635
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,480
problems more sinus congestion it's

636
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,039
strep Aus that causes all the UTI by the

637
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,440
way it's it's not yeast it's strep yeast

638
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,080
is just always around when you have a

639
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
bacteria that's causing the real problem

640
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,760
so when you think you have a yeast

641
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,600
infection it's a UTI it's actually a

642
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,679
strepa cacus infection with yeast being

643
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,120
present and they look for the yeast they

644
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,559
don't look for the strepa cacus just so

645
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,320
you know it's rare they even bother to

646
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,399
look for it so you get told you got a

647
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,799
yeast

648
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,399
infection and um and then when you get

649
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,600
you know if you get a UTI that gets so

650
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,159
bad where it gets to the kidneys and

651
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,679
there's bleeding then they finally say

652
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,760
oh yeah it's bacteria let's do lots of

653
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,200
antibiotics you know they just forget

654
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,880
the yeast tag they just don't use the

655
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,000
yeast tag anymore but it's always been

656
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,799
strepa cacus that's how it's always with

657
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,480
always has been with UT so when you're

658
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,840
dealing with grains like wheat you could

659
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,399
be feeding a condition can be feeding

660
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,080
strep it could be feeding you

661
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,559
coli you could be feeding um some SE

662
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,720
diff that's in your system that's been

663
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,559
sitting around slightly dormant for

664
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,919
years and years and years you could be

665
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,960
feeding um the viruses all the different

666
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,360
viruses there are if you're dealing with

667
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,840
a retrovirus you know like HIV you're

668
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,640
dealing with a retrovirus you don't want

669
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,399
to feed it grains so that's another

670
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
thing

671
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,000
too if you're dealing with stealth

672
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,120
viruses you don't want to feed them

673
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
grains um if you're dealing with the flu

674
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,520
you don't want to have a grain well a

675
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,960
grain like wheat you don't want to like

676
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,799
a grain like

677
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,039
corn so those are two that you really

678
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,399
don't want to

679
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,960
use um and and we want to be careful we

680
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,039
want to be careful so these SE are some

681
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,080
of the things to think about of how it

682
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,760
works um and and let's go into a couple

683
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,559
different things while we have time

684
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,399
about grains I don't want to leave you

685
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:43,399
guys hanging without covering like info

686
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:47,840
about them are there good

687
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:50,440
grains yes there are um quinoa is a good

688
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,559
grain um people are convinced it's not a

689
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,880
grain I think

690
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,799
psychologically it was a really good

691
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,080
twist but it's a grain just so you you

692
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,720
know people are convinced it's not a

693
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,720
grain people are convinced it's just a

694
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,399
seed that's incorrect I'm going to tell

695
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,320
you that right now it's a grain but the

696
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:14,520
technique of calling it a seed has upped

697
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,080
its value tremendously by taking it out

698
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,000
of the grain world it's a bril it was

699
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,799
brilliant it was absolutely brilliant

700
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,840
because it it really did Elevate Quin

701
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,720
elevated out of it it said no you're the

702
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,480
Jesus Christ of of the grains you're not

703
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,399
a grain and it elevated it up but it's a

704
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,799
grain sorry about that it is so so the

705
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:41,600
deal is is quinoa is a good one now if

706
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,080
you're you know into like um if you're

707
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,880
into like uh no car and autoimmune is

708
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,039
caused by grains you're you're not going

709
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,640
to be offered quinoa most

710
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,240
likely um but it's actually okay now if

711
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
you're somebody you're dealing with a

712
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,640
lot of different symptoms and a lot of

713
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,559
different varieties of symptoms you've

714
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,679
been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

715
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,880
it could be anything Hashimoto could be

716
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,360
anything lupus um and you know

717
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,159
Scleroderma to um you know anything

718
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,880
sarcoidosis to um you know spino litis

719
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,799
whatever it is that you're dealing with

720
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,720
all these different things ecomori to

721
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,360
different problems ra um chronic fatigue

722
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,880
then it's a good idea to keep even the

723
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,320
good grains out even the good grains out

724
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,559
but your heart set on it your heart set

725
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,320
on on it you really want the grain then

726
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,440
you want to be thinking about quinoa

727
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,919
it's one of the best ones if you um if

728
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,919
you know if you're not dealing with a

729
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,159
lot but you enjoy grains you can go with

730
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,279
quinoa let's talk about another one too

731
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,320
uh Millet Millet is a good one now the

732
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,559
problem is with grains now too is that

733
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,519
they're changing a little bit there's a

734
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,679
lot of GMO grains on the market they're

735
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,799
moving in that kind of ruined it in so

736
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,080
many ways like wheat's changed wheat's

737
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,720
been hybridized so many times that's one

738
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,360
way that that's kind of gotten it a

739
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,720
little messed up um the old days it was

740
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,200
hybridized and and hybridization is not

741
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,120
a bad thing but when it comes down to

742
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,000
when its grains it's not helpful at all

743
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,159
and um so Millet is something that's a

744
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,799
good grain too you can get Millet bread

745
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,480
but Millet bread usually comes with all

746
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,279
this other stuff so you're better off

747
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,000
just cooking up Millet on its own Millet

748
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:25,120
by itself is really nutritious it's a

749
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,240
gluten-free grain quinoa is gluten-free

750
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,600
and it's a really these are two

751
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,799
nutritious grains so it I learned this

752
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,200
too you know it's food is really

753
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:38,159
expensive really expensive I mean it it

754
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,760
it takes a whole paycheck to shop

755
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,279
nowadays um you're buying fruit you're

756
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,760
buying vegetables people don't buy a lot

757
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,159
of fruit really anyway you know so which

758
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,799
has to change in the world we got to get

759
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,919
people eating more fruit for their

760
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,440
longevity but you know people buy

761
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,600
vegetables people buy you know proteins

762
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,000
people you know and it's expensive and

763
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,480
it adds up really fast you know and I

764
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,120
have people that are on budgets I know

765
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,760
people that are on budgets they go go

766
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,760
look I only can have I only have $50

767
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,320
this week and what do I do you know only

768
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,000
have $25 this week what do I do and if I

769
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,679
think they're not so bad off with

770
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,039
different conditions and pathogens and

771
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,840
everything else if I think they're not

772
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,039
so bad off with all of that I'll say

773
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,279
look why don't you get some Millet why

774
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
don't you get some Miller it's really

775
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,679
cheap really inexpensive you can cook a

776
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,640
huge pot of it it's not going to feed

777
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,320
your

778
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
pathogens because you know Epstein bar

779
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,519
really doesn't feed off of millet it

780
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
really doesn't you know there's

781
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,799
pathogens that won't feed off of it it's

782
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,679
not the it's not great for anybody to be

783
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,919
on lots of grain or grain if they have a

784
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,399
lot of conditions because something

785
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,919
could potentially feed off of it but

786
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:49,880
Millet is one of those foods that

787
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,399
doesn't really do that so much so I'll

788
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,399
say to somebody who's only got $25 a

789
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,360
week uh which I totally get I totally

790
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:00,240
understand and it's like here you know

791
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,919
get a pot of millet cook that pot of

792
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,120
millet once a day and in the end that

793
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:05,279
pot of millet is going to cost you you

794
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,639
know every time you have a bowl of M

795
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,799
it's going to be 10 cents 15 cents I

796
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,519
don't know what it is something like

797
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,480
that and that's one option and the same

798
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,720
thing with with quinoa you can get

799
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,480
quinoa it Cooks up it's light and fluffy

800
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,559
you can get away with it um oatmeal

801
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,240
that's one right there oatmeal

802
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,960
gluten-free oatmeal why do we say that

803
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,760
cuz it's always process in factories

804
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,159
with gluten it's always processed in

805
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,840
factories with gluten and wheat and

806
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:34,480
everything else so you want to make sure

807
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,519
it's gluten-free so there's not gluten

808
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,000
if you're worried about gluten but

809
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,600
oatmeal still cut of Oats that works for

810
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,600
some people but listen listen understand

811
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,919
this some people they just don't do good

812
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,519
with grains but some people don't do

813
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,720
good with meat some people don't do good

814
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,880
with chicken some people don't do good

815
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,519
with you know fruit they say some people

816
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,760
don't do good with vegetables at all

817
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,240
some people can't eat a salad salad um I

818
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,720
have people who can't eat a salad but

819
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,120
they can eat oatmeal I have people that

820
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,720
can eat you seriously I got people that

821
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,760
all they could do is you know eat

822
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,240
chicken and they can't eat one

823
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,840
vegetable um you know I got people that

824
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,360
you know can only eat fruit it's the

825
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,720
only thing that feels good in their

826
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,240
stomach and they can't eat you know a

827
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,279
vegetable I got people that can only eat

828
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,720
fruit and can't eat meat I got people

829
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,080
that only you know can eat meat and and

830
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,159
like one vegetable so it's it's you know

831
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,760
it's it's kind of like that you got to

832
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,840
see where you're at but

833
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,600
oatmeal won't necessarily feed a bad

834
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,600
pathogen so if you need to use it or can

835
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,880
use it you can if you can you can um

836
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,960
Millet won't necessarily feed a pathogen

837
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,760
if you need it you can use it I like

838
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,480
Millet better uh than oatmeal I like

839
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,399
quinoa better than oatmeal and like I

840
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,120
said affordability it's pretty cool

841
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,639
definitely don't do Sprout at wheat it's

842
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,039
not it's a waste of your time it's a

843
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:05,840
sprout at wheat it's totally a waste of

844
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,840
your time um and stay away from wheat

845
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,559
completely if you're dealing with any

846
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,000
symptom or condition and if you don't

847
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,399
even have a symptom or condition I still

848
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,399
just don't even like wheat um cuz the

849
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,960
potential is there the potential is

850
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,760
there for something the potential is

851
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:25,519
there let's talk about rice arsenic are

852
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:28,320
no arsenic is arsenic in rice okay this

853
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,000
is this is going to blow your mind

854
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,919
is there arsenic and rice no there isn't

855
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,279
there isn't yeah do you have Stones

856
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,720
ready cuz you're going to have to Stone

857
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,440
me to death over here because there I'm

858
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,559
I'm going to get a lot of people angry

859
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,880
okay this was a

860
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:53,559
misconception there is arsenic in one

861
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,840
variety of stripped white rice okay one

862
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,799
variety of stripped white rice out there

863
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,240
there's some arsenic in there due to the

864
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,399
pesticides but those arsenic pesticides

865
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,279
are on

866
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,079
everything everything they on everything

867
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,839
and that's where it came from I mean

868
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,679
that's where where it's happening it's

869
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,280
everywhere it's copper and Arsenic and

870
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,040
it's on conventional stuff I mean if

871
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,200
you're really really in a financial

872
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,359
problem and you can't eat one thing

873
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,079
organic then we yes we do conventional

874
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,399
fruits and vegetables without a doubt

875
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,560
but the Arsenic is on

876
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,720
every it's in every pesticide it's

877
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,000
ladled everywhere it's it's on

878
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:40,200
everything so you get organic

879
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,440
rice and you pick organic brown rice the

880
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,919
safest and the best is organic short

881
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,919
grain brown rice organic short grain

882
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,440
brown rice okay that's the safest

883
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:53,720
there's no arsenic on it there's no

884
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,879
arsenic in it it's not it's not there

885
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,920
because arsenic comes from those heavy

886
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,960
laden pesticides sides especially in

887
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,599
other countries where they're still

888
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,040
using DDT everything else that's where

889
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,480
that arsenic is I'm just telling you

890
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,160
right now this was another Mass

891
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,960
confusion don't be afraid of rice um

892
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,960
rice is gluten-free can totally do rice

893
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,000
if you really like it um absolutely had

894
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,760
someone tell me hey look you know I ate

895
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,040
rice all these years I heard it's bad

896
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,720
for you now I heard it causes autoimmune

897
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,400
no rice doesn't cause autoimmune rice if

898
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,440
you eat a lot of it it could

899
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,640
potentially instigate a pathogen but if

900
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,200
you're feeling healthy enough you're

901
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,680
feeling stable enough you don't have a

902
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,440
lot of symptoms you don't have a lot of

903
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,359
conditions you don't have a lot of money

904
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,880
you want to have a pot of brown rice you

905
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,760
have a pot of brown rice if you really

906
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,480
want have it with

907
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,480
vegetables you see how it works it's not

908
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,400
about what Anthony's belief system is

909
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
like does Anthony you know believe in

910
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,079
this and this only or does Anthony

911
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,400
believe in that sounds silly but it's

912
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,880
not about that it's about what's right

913
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,440
it's about what works about what's

914
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,960
really wrong with someone's Health it's

915
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,800
about the right information if you

916
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,640
logged on to this show you're going to

917
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,040
get the right information you're going

918
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,200
to get why autoimmune is called called

919
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,480
Auto autoimmune and how the blame was

920
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,760
put on us you're going to get why you

921
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,839
know we're told their body's attacking

922
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,800
itself you're going to get why we get

923
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,680
sick you're going to get what's really

924
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,640
causing the sicknesses oh it's not the

925
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,359
grain you're also going to get a guy

926
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,800
that says which is me don't eat the

927
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,920
grain don't eat wheat don't eat corn

928
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,599
they'll feed the pathogens so it's not

929
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,520
like I'm sitting here saying oh you can

930
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,040
eat all the grain you want oh forget

931
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,000
autoimmune that's not what I'm talking

932
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,440
about you guys are listening so if you

933
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,480
just logged on to the show go back to

934
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,160
the beginning and you're going to have

935
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,839
to hear the beginning of the show

936
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,480
so how can grains work better for us if

937
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,440
we're going to eat them if you're going

938
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,880
to choose to eat them I mean me

939
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,839
personally I like eating some fruit

940
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,680
because I want the longevity I want the

941
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,079
antioxidants I want the

942
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,240
phytochemicals um I want the asparagus I

943
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,800
want the spinach I want the papaya you

944
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,119
know I like those because of what they

945
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,640
offer I talked about the raw honey I

946
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,400
like the raw honey I know I get the

947
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,160
vegans so upset I understand I get the

948
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,240
plant-based people so upset with the

949
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,400
honey but we're going to do a show and

950
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm going to talk about how honey really

951
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,720
is vegan by the way so this a whole

952
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,960
another misconception I have to help

953
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,359
everybody out with it's so important to

954
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,240
know this the vegans need to know this

955
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,680
that honey is okay to eat now I really

956
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,960
got everybody mad but here's the deal

957
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,000
here's the deal um it's all about

958
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,640
phytochemicals what has the most

959
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,800
medicine what can help and heal our

960
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,319
diseases and our conditions what can

961
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,160
protect us from cancer is why I did

962
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,800
lifechanging Foods book if you haven't

963
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
ordered a copy yet just don't forget

964
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,560
because it's it's my greatest prayers

965
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,319
and wishes that people actually have

966
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,640
that information and I want people to

967
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,960
heal and then you could help other

968
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,960
people heal and other people heal and

969
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,440
that's what it's about so you know it's

970
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,119
about this fight of chemicals it's about

971
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,599
the antioxidants it's about all of that

972
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,119
information it's not about what I like

973
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:06,640
what I don't like and so that's very

974
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,720
important it's not what about a belief

975
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,440
system I subscribe to it's about just

976
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:17,560
making sure you guys get what you need

977
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,040
celery works great with with uh grains

978
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,240
it works incredible you can you can cook

979
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,000
celery steam it chop it up have it in a

980
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,240
grain dish if you want you can have it

981
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,680
raw chopped up raw and put in a quinoa

982
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,680
dish celery is amazing you can for that

983
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,359
it's incredible for that really healing

984
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,400
really profoundly powerful when you put

985
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,760
it with a grain meaning that what celery

986
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,240
does is celery makes the grain work it

987
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,000
makes the grain um

988
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,160
eliminate its potential of

989
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,160
phytochemicals because grains have

990
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,480
medicine in them too so what happens is

991
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,839
when you have celery with with quinoa if

992
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,880
if you have celery with a little brown

993
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,319
rice if that's something you want if you

994
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,680
have that the celery the mineral salts

995
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:08,079
in the celery the the rare mineral salts

996
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,760
that are are not measured by science and

997
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,400
research turn the grain into something

998
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,720
that's what happens it Cates the grain

999
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,599
it Cates what is good the phytochemical

1000
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,240
in the grain could have that with quinoa

1001
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,400
you can have celery with any grain you

1002
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,079
choose cucumbers chop up cucumbers have

1003
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,760
that with a quinoa dish have that with a

1004
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,400
millet dish have that with a rice dish

1005
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,560
incredible cucumbers help as well they

1006
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,800
help balance the acidity of grains cuz

1007
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,079
grains are really acidic they're really

1008
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,079
acidic so they help so you know the

1009
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,440
Cucumber helps balance that acidity with

1010
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,359
the grain

1011
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,000
spinach spinach is incredible it

1012
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,839
actually helps the body break down

1013
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,119
digest and use the amino acids correctly

1014
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,800
from the grains

1015
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,960
one of the things is Arginine you know

1016
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,640
that's one of the amino acids

1017
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,240
everybody's worried about when it comes

1018
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,880
down to grains carnitine is the amino

1019
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,119
acid we have to worry about carnitine

1020
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,160
don't take carnitine supplements if you

1021
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:16,920
have a condition it'll blow it up it'll

1022
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:19,560
blow that condition out of the water for

1023
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,160
you in a bad way so don't you know

1024
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,240
carnitine that's the one that's

1025
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,400
Troublesome it ignites viruses it

1026
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,079
ignites everything Under the Sun arine

1027
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,920
is like a

1028
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:38,680
firecracker to carnitine which is like a

1029
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:42,560
bomb okay I'm just telling you right now

1030
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:45,200
so you know um spinach helps knock down

1031
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Arginine uh actually celery does too

1032
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,839
both those knock down Arginine levels if

1033
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:54,720
there if a grain has any of that in

1034
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:58,079
there um lettuce lettuce is really work

1035
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,480
good with grains rice can go in lettuce

1036
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,520
um lettuce wraps you can take Roma leaf

1037
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,720
lettuce we could put rice in there and

1038
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,200
um this is if your you're you dig grains

1039
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,800
you know like I did have a few people

1040
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,359
tell me look I love grains ate them my

1041
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,359
whole life the whole world's against

1042
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,119
them what do I do I'm like look as long

1043
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,680
as you're feeling this and feeling that

1044
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,079
and guidelines and everything else that

1045
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm talking about on the show then fine

1046
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,800
um Water Crest it's a great one with

1047
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,800
grains

1048
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,800
arugula that's a good one mhm

1049
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:35,200
sipping a little water here arugula

1050
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,880
that's a great one arugula is like a a

1051
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,839
tonic for the

1052
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,280
stomach arugula helps with hydrochloric

1053
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,240
acid as well those rare seven the seven

1054
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,000
hydrochloric acid blend and arugula

1055
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,560
helps stimulate that and create a little

1056
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,079
bit more hydrochloric acid a little a

1057
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,800
lot different than celery celer you know

1058
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,680
basically helps build the strength of

1059
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,960
your hydrochloric acid helps build the

1060
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,079
strength the

1061
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,000
sorry arugula tongue Tiding me there

1062
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,599
arugula does more than that in a

1063
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,079
different way it takes the the

1064
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:12,000
hydrochloric acid that you have and it

1065
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,920
strengthens it celery produces it get it

1066
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,640
actually allows a production of

1067
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,160
hydrochloric acid helps you know build

1068
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,280
that hydrochloric acid up levels of it

1069
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,839
up aruga you know amplifies it in a

1070
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,760
different way that was a little

1071
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,520
confusing but that's what ites does it

1072
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,079
they both work together and it's

1073
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,880
something to have in your diet one way

1074
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,640
or another but it works great with

1075
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,160
grains Sprouts micro grains help

1076
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,200
neutralize the acidity in grains because

1077
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,800
they're so alkaline that's another thing

1078
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,599

because the the the uh crust the wheat

1102
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,160
crust is going to feed some kind of

1103
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,680
pathogen the cheese is going to feed

1104
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,599
some kind of pathogen that's what's

1105
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,319
going to give you a problem when it

1111
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,920
really helpful for grains fresh tomatoes

1112
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,119
tomato salads tomato cucumber salads

1113
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,760
with some quinoa in it can't go wrong

1114
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,839
onions they work great with grains I'm

1115
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,760
not talking about Flavor I mean sure

1116
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:25,040
probably flavors it good but I'm talking

1117
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,599
about synergistically bio identically it

1118
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,400
connects to

1119
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:34,680
the grain um scallions and chives they

1120
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,720
work great with Millet TEF they work

1121
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,280
great with TEF that's another one they

1122
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,920
work great with amaranth you can use

1123
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,079
amaranth and TEF they're very good

1124
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,160
grains um you can definitely get into

1125
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,040
those if you need to Ginger it's

1126
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,079
incredible too it's an incredible um

1127
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,079
tonic for the stomach which helps you

1128
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,160
utilize the grain more turmeric um

1129
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,960
turmeric does something interesting it

1130
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,880
enhances enhances the good amino acids

1131
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,760
and Grains it enhances them pulls them

1132
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,280
out enhances them actually puts them as

1133
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,079
a star puts them up on a

1134
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,319
pedestal

1135
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,680
Rosemary I think I put that one in

1136
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:13,880
because it tastes so good with a grain

1137
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,359
Rosemary Rosemary does more than that

1138
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,839
Rose Rosemary stimulates um digestion

1139
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,839
strengthens digestion it's like a

1140
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:23,319
digestion Aid and when you have that

1141
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:26,640
with a grain they really work together

1142
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:28,680
good avocado goes great with grain

1143
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,920
because instead of using butter instead

1144
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,520
of using butter instead of using you

1145
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,000
know um cheese or some other type of fat

1146
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,839
um you can instead of using bad oil like

1147
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,720
canola oil you can use avocado with your

1148
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,839
Millet avocado with some rice avocado

1149
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,960
Azure

1150
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,800
butter and garlic Garlic's a great one

1151
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,559
because garlic the phytochemicals and

1152
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,359
garlic actually bind to the grain they

1153
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,640
become one so as they go down through

1154
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,440
your intestinal track they become Bug

1155
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,040
Killers garlic sticks to the Grain and

1156
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,319
it kills bugs as it goes down through

1157
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,240
your intestinal tract so anybody's

1158
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,280
worried about a worm that's a great way

1159
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,160
of

1160
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,400
deworming so these are some of the

1161
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,480
options that we have so here's the deal

1162
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:21,079
here's the deal if you're somebody that

1163
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,680
is afraid of eating fruit but you only

1164
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:26,079
eat grain try to switch it off try to

1165
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,119
move the grain out of your diet and eat

1166
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,559
more fruit there's no question um if

1167
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,599
you're somebody afraid of a lot of

1168
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,760
vegetables but you eat a lot of grain

1169
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,240
try to move the grain out and start

1170
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,040
bringing in more

1171
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,760
vegetables um if you're someone that

1172
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,280
likes a lot of fish keep the grains

1173
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,800
really low it don't want a lot of grains

1174
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,160
while you're doing a lot of fish you

1175
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,440
don't want too you know like a lot of

1176
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,079
people do fish and rice I would say

1177
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,559
quinoa is the safest grain with fish so

1178
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,640
if you like wild salmon and you want to

1179
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,720
do a grain or you're over somebody's

1180
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,319
house house that's what they're making

1181
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,119
whatever it is you know I mean or you're

1182
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,200
at a restaurant and you want to ask for

1183
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,160
something like that you can do like

1184
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,400
salmon and some kinoa but try not to do

1185
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,280
salmon and some a basket of bread at the

1186
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,920
restaurant too you know wheat bread try

1187
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,839
not to do wheat and salmon try not to

1188
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,280
have a salmon

1189
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:18,920
sandwich and um and same thing with rice

1190
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,440
try not do salmon and rice you try to do

1191
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,880
say salmon and quinoa or just salmon and

1192
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,160
vegetables or you know another fish that

1193
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,839
you like if you're a big meat eater keep

1194
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,520
the grains to literally a little bit of

1195
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:34,480
quinoa and maybe a little bit of of

1196
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,480
millet once in a while if you're doing a

1197
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,240
lot of meat meat doesn't go great with

1198
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,000
grains at all we've known this forever

1199
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,960
and I say we because I've seen that

1200
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,200
circulate among the um alternative

1201
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,559
communities and I agree with it since

1202
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,119
the beginning of its conception that the

1203
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:54,640
body has a hard time digesting digesting

1204
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,680
heavy amounts of protein while digesting

1205
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,760
a starch at the the same time if you're

1206
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,480
a big grass-fed beef eater keep your

1207
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,400
grains minimum you can do more fruit you

1208
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,079
can do lots of vegetables you can do

1209
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,240
more fruit you can do a few nuts and

1210
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,040
seeds but keep your grains down lower if

1211
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,280
you're doing animal protein once a day

1212
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,520
if you're a person who just likes to

1213
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,079
have a little bit of chicken at night or

1214
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,680
a little bit of turkey at night or

1215
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,000
something like that and you're doing

1216
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,280
animal protein once a day um don't do

1217
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,839
don't do grains more than once a day if

1218
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,119
you're grain eater if you really like

1219
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:31,599
grains so that's the kind of the you

1220
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,839
know a little bit of a systematic plan

1221
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:39,280
for you guys if you're really you know

1222
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:40,960
doing that um if you're raw vegan um

1223
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,920
just just stay away from grains all

1224
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,520
together um if you're dealing with a lot

1225
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,280
of illnesses or conditions stay away

1226
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,200
from grains altogether you know if

1227
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,559
you're feeling pretty good and and

1228
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,559
you're living your life and you want

1229
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,760
some Keen watch it'd be all right so

1230
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,280
it's kind of like that you got to play

1231
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,040
it by ear see where you are but but

1232
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,520
there's no skull and crossbones in front

1233
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,559
of quinoa Millet steel cut oats even

1234
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,280
buckwheat you know it's not buckwheat's

1235
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:08,839
not my favorite but you know meaning

1236
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,160
like I'm not that fond of it for a lot

1237
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:14,119
of health reasons but even buckwheat

1238
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,960
rice you know te amaranth there's no

1239
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:19,640
skull and crossbones in front of it okay

1240
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,480
they don't create autoimmune all right

1241
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:26,680
so that's how it works corn and wheat

1242
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:29,880
definitely feed bugs

1243
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,880
that mistaken the world as the body

1244
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,200
attacking

1245
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,200
itself okay when really it's the bug

1246
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,640
attacking the body by getting fueled up

1247
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,079
with wheat and corn so I'm trying to

1248
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,000
clarify that 100% so understand that

1249
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,839
that's important to know but there's

1250
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,200
still skull and crossbones in front of

1251
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,160
grains and um so if you need to

1252
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,760
incorporate them like I said some people

1253
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,200
they can't afford food and you can buy a

1254
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,480
big sack of millet and you can cook it

1255
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,040
each day and you could feed your family

1256
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,799
and you're feeding them healthy you

1257
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,440
really are so you got to you know there

1258
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:08,079
there's different ways of of doing

1259
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,920
things so anyway I hope I covered like a

1260
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,599
lot of grain stuff there's only a few

1261
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,680
minutes left so let me just cover one

1262
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,839
more thing mot toxins and mold and

1263
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,319
fungus okay that's a whole thing about

1264
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:22,040
grains so it's mot toxin that whole mot

1265
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:25,680
toxin thing um it's not what people

1266
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:28,359
think microt toxins are really not the

1267
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,280
the the problem with the grain as far as

1268
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:34,160
with the grain microt toxins are a

1269
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,559
problem when we get triggered by

1270
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,520
inhaling breathing in or eating or

1271
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,599
living in mold like the dangerous molds

1272
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,760
the black mold I did a mold show talking

1273
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,839
about this and the MotoX sins are

1274
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,680
actually poisons that are in the mold

1275
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:52,119
that the mold produces and grain does

1276
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,480
collect mold and we know it's been been

1277
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,680
you know capable of collecting mold but

1278
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,920
so does everything you can get the worst

1279
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,160
microt toxins from meat collecting Mo

1280
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,680
mold you can you know anything can

1281
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,359
collect mold fish can collect mold meat

1282
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,960
can collect mold anything can collect

1283
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,160
mold so you have to understand that the

1284
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,599
microt toxins are all around everywhere

1285
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,920
with every food item we have on this

1286
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,880
planet and that's just how it works so

1287
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,559
you just don't want to eat moldy grains

1288
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
is what I'm trying to say so when you

1289
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,200
get quinoa you just make sure it's good

1290
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,559
stuff high quality it won't have mold in

1291
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,960
it so you're not going to get any MIT

1292
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,960
microt toxins this is another huge

1293
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,960
confusion out there in the alternative

1294
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,440
movement about microt toxins and

1295
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,920
everything else and but wheat and corn

1296
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,319
feed viruses that create neurotoxins and

1297
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,799
those are the ones that make us

1298
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,640
neurologically sick not mot toxins I'm

1299
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,480
not saying mot toxins are good cuz mold

1300
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,599
isn't it does knock us down so that

1301
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,720
Epstein bar can take over and other

1302
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:53,720
things can take over so and we'll do

1303
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,640
another mot toxin show too to really

1304
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,520
