[178.24 - 184.88] toxins and one of my my favorite topics
[180.60 - 187.80] of all time Mercury aluminum copper
[184.88 - 189.28] heavy metals toxic heavy metals all of
[187.80 - 192.20] it I want to cut into this a little bit
[189.28 - 194.08] so I'm excited seriously though you guys
[192.20 - 196.40] I mean aren't you excited as well cuz
[194.08 - 198.96] this is going to be really fun check it
[196.40 - 201.00] out but go to medicalmedium.com if you
[198.96 - 204.24] can all right go to medical medium.com
[201.00 - 206.12] and check it out there because you can
[204.24 - 208.48] you can uh
[206.12 - 211.08] register so I'm excited let's get down
[208.48 - 212.80] to it let's get into the information a
[211.08 - 216.04] little bit I want to talk about some
[212.80 - 218.32] metals never before in our history and
[216.04 - 219.76] I'm reading right here at a new edition
[218.32 - 221.88] right here at a new bring the new
[219.76 - 224.76] addition bring this
[221.88 - 227.20] one never before in our history have we
[224.76 - 230.40] been exposed to so many poisonous
[227.20 - 233.36] substances and that's true never before
[230.40 - 235.00] in our history have we been exposed like
[233.36 - 237.76] this this includes the toxic heavy
[235.00 - 240.40] metals Mercury aluminum copper lead
[237.76 - 244.36] nickel cadan arsenic
[240.40 - 246.64] that's right and more air pollution such
[244.36 - 248.36] as Chemtrails pharmaceutical narot
[246.64 - 250.24] technology chemical sprayed on almost
[248.36 - 252.84] everything manufactured pesticides
[250.24 - 254.92] herbicides fungicides blah blah blah you
[252.84 - 257.44] know the drill you know how many poisons
[254.92 - 259.64] and toxins there are you guys know it's
[257.44 - 262.12] serious it's real out there people are
[259.64 - 264.00] getting exposed every single day and
[262.12 - 265.32] metals get passed down from generation
[264.00 - 267.20] to generation so I'm going to talk about
[265.32 - 269.40] the Mercury man and a little bit more in
[267.20 - 271.84] here too these poisons saturate our
[269.40 - 274.24] water or reservoirs they find their way
[271.84 - 276.56] in from the coffee you get at the coffee
[274.24 - 279.12] shop they find their way in they fall
[276.56 - 281.60] out of the sky the majority of these
[279.12 - 284.00] substances are so new that it'll take
[281.60 - 285.68] decades before science recognizes how
[284.00 - 289.40] dangerous they are to our health that's
[285.68 - 291.96] way when you hear people go glycate gate
[289.40 - 295.28] or they go you know and they go from
[291.96 - 297.20] alide from Malahide or they go you know
[295.28 - 300.04] something else right and they think
[297.20 - 302.24] they're onto the like the the the scary
[300.04 - 303.40] chemical the scariest poison and they
[302.24 - 305.40] think they're on to it and then it
[303.40 - 308.56] becomes the buzz word whatever it is
[305.40 - 311.56] there's way more than that and the
[308.56 - 314.04] industry knows this and knows it and
[311.56 - 316.72] they're like you guys worry about yeah
[314.04 - 320.12] you worry about those yeah you guys keep
[316.72 - 321.84] your eyes on that and the decoys you
[320.12 - 324.48] know they're bad the decoys don't get me
[321.84 - 325.64] wrong but you guys keep a little watch
[324.48 - 329.00] on the
[325.64 - 331.36] decoys and then the real scary stuff
[329.00 - 333.88] nobody knows about they keep that stuff
[331.36 - 337.36] top secret
[333.88 - 339.68] classified seriously people have no idea
[337.36 - 341.44] there's chemicals that are in things
[339.68 - 343.24] that just AR you don't know because it's
[341.44 - 344.80] in it and no one's talking about it and
[343.24 - 346.56] no one's going to like look at that
[344.80 - 348.80] chemical analiz it they don't even know
[346.56 - 350.36] it exists because if you don't know it
[348.80 - 352.04] exists you can't test for it then you
[350.36 - 355.92] can't find it you see how it
[352.04 - 358.04] works that's how it works they can take
[355.92 - 359.00] new chemicals a whole batch of them but
[358.04 - 360.24] if they don't know what that new
[359.00 - 362.88] chemical is
[360.24 - 367.56] they can't find it test for it and find
[362.88 - 368.96] it how crazy is that how crazy is that
[367.56 - 371.68] it's only if they know what they're
[368.96 - 374.48] looking for like the chemical was
[371.68 - 377.32] registered the chemical was put out
[374.48 - 379.80] there and if it was registered put out
[377.32 - 382.08] there and then they took samples of it
[379.80 - 384.24] and they brought it to the agencies and
[382.08 - 385.72] everybody knew what that thing was and
[384.24 - 387.48] they knew it and they can actually tag
[385.72 - 389.24] it and understand it so then they can
[387.48 - 390.76] look for it but that's the whole thing
[389.24 - 392.96] you guys don't know there's all these
[390.76 - 395.64] chemicals that research and Science and
[392.96 - 397.56] all that environmentalists don't know
[395.64 - 399.92] about nobody knows about but instead
[397.56 - 403.36] they focus on DET
[399.92 - 405.72] decoy chemicals to give them a detour
[403.36 - 407.92] that's how it is and even the decoy ones
[405.72 - 409.12] are bad but the point is is there's so
[407.92 - 410.48] many other ones out there so I just
[409.12 - 412.24] wanted to mention that because I haven't
[410.48 - 413.40] mentioned that yet I don't think in a
[412.24 - 415.80] long
[413.40 - 417.88] time the majority of these substances
[415.80 - 419.68] are so new that it'll take decades
[417.88 - 422.80] before science recognizes them that's
[419.68 - 425.56] the whole point you can't recognize them
[422.80 - 427.12] until someone registers it they know
[425.56 - 429.32] what it is it's got its patent number
[427.12 - 431.20] rigged it's ready they get a test sample
[429.32 - 434.24] they can say well who I've never seen
[431.20 - 435.48] that let's actually Mark that one and
[434.24 - 436.96] now we know we can look for it in the
[435.48 - 438.64] water system we can look for it in
[436.96 - 440.56] somebody's coffee we can look for it in
[438.64 - 442.56] somebody's drug we can look for it
[440.56 - 444.04] somewhere but you can't look for it if
[442.56 - 445.48] you don't know where it is and what it
[444.04 - 447.84] is you don't know what it is and can't
[445.48 - 449.76] identify and that's how many thousands
[447.84 - 451.80] of these chemicals are out there that's
[449.76 - 455.40] how much exposure people
[451.80 - 458.08] have I took my celery force
[455.40 - 460.36] today and those risks will only be
[458.08 - 462.24] discovered if funding in common sense go
[460.36 - 464.92] in the right direction we know how that
[462.24 - 469.16] works which is unlikely most Industries
[464.92 - 470.76] M Mo their MO is to put chemicals into
[469.16 - 472.68] our environment and deal with the
[470.76 - 475.08] consequences down the road you put the
[472.68 - 476.96] bad stuff out 50 years down the road
[475.08 - 480.80] something gets discovered somehow
[476.96 - 483.76] someway or talked about and then boom
[480.80 - 485.48] most of us are carrying around toxins
[483.76 - 487.20] that have been with us for almost their
[485.48 - 489.32] whole lives and have burrowed deep
[487.20 - 491.32] inside of us I just saw somebody it's
[489.32 - 493.64] this one right here just so you know
[491.32 - 497.20] it's medical medium New Edition right in
[493.64 - 499.08] my hands Incredible Book it's saved so
[497.20 - 501.80] many lives around the world so many
[499.08 - 504.00] people people getting out of wheelchairs
[501.80 - 506.60] because they got answers to why they
[504.00 - 509.80] were suffering their pain and all of the
[506.60 - 512.32] all the hell they've been through Chris
[509.80 - 514.40] over there um I'm bringing my friend
[512.32 - 516.52] that's a doctor and he drinks celery
[514.40 - 518.28] juice now too thank you you just
[516.52 - 520.56] reminded me to sip some of my celery
[518.28 - 522.32] juice Amanda Stefani says I registered
[520.56 - 526.00] just now I'm so excited whoa I can't
[522.32 - 529.12] wait I'll see you there whoa mhm I'm
[526.00 - 529.12] excited to see you there that's
[529.56 - 536.96] amazing toxic heavy metals for example
[534.08 - 538.44] can oxidize overtime and kill cells
[536.96 - 541.28] around them so I want to give you guys a
[538.44 - 543.32] little bit of that de
[541.28 - 546.40] demonstration let's bring this out for a
[543.32 - 548.72] minute let's look for some markers
[546.40 - 551.84] really quick let's
[548.72 - 556.40] go all
[551.84 - 560.76] right so you got your brain
[556.40 - 564.24] right okay got your brain right
[560.76 - 566.76] here got a little bit of the midline
[564.24 - 570.16] canal right there see the midline
[566.76 - 574.40] canal little bit of art happening
[570.16 - 576.80] okay all right and then you got your
[574.40 - 580.00] Metals you got your metal deposits that
[576.80 - 585.40] got in here from birth from both the
[580.00 - 588.08] parents passed on down from exposures
[585.40 - 590.80] antibiotics loaded with toxic heavy
[588.08 - 593.56] metals of all kinds right so we got the
[590.80 - 596.04] metal deposits right here okay let's
[593.56 - 598.24] make a nice big metal deposit right
[596.04 - 600.12] there let's get it to Glow a little bit
[598.24 - 602.96] maybe we could use some paint maybe you
[600.12 - 604.60] can see it maybe not there we go and
[602.96 - 606.88] then let's do another deposit somewhere
[604.60 - 609.12] else cuz I want to show you guys this is
[606.88 - 609.12] a
[609.92 - 614.00] brain yep that's a
[612.28 - 619.04] brain all
[614.00 - 622.64] right okay here's what happens okay over
[619.04 - 627.44] time in everybody's head some faster
[622.64 - 629.84] some slower in everybody's head over
[627.44 - 632.36] time oxidation happen happens to the
[629.84 - 635.12] toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum
[632.36 - 638.56] copper mainly those three and oxidation
[635.12 - 642.48] occurs and when oxidation occurs
[638.56 - 644.64] it leeches and that leeching comes out
[642.48 - 646.68] of those deposits you see this right
[644.64 - 650.12] here and there's a lot of things that
[646.68 - 653.40] make the metals leech fast really really
[650.12 - 655.52] high fat diet makes the metals leech
[653.40 - 657.64] more okay that's just an example right
[655.52 - 660.12] there and I I'll cover some other things
[657.64 - 661.72] that make it leech more as well
[660.12 - 663.16] adrenaline doesn't help that's for sure
[661.72 - 665.44] and a lot of people are jacked up all
[663.16 - 666.96] the time they're high on their caffeine
[665.44 - 669.20] and everything else I'm not blaming
[666.96 - 672.44] anybody or judging anybody so these
[669.20 - 674.60] metal deposits right here are
[672.44 - 678.24] leeching and guess what happens when
[674.60 - 680.00] they leech when they leech we end up
[678.24 - 684.16] getting
[680.00 - 688.48] dementia over time we end up losing our
[684.16 - 690.28] memory okay our memory we end up getting
[688.48 - 693.44] episodes and
[690.28 - 695.24] spells we get a lot of symptoms even if
[693.44 - 697.48] it's not diagnosed as
[695.24 - 700.92] dementia
[697.48 - 702.92] okay so as these leech these metal
[700.92 - 706.48] deposits right here some Mercury
[702.92 - 708.72] leeching there's some aluminum oxidizing
[706.48 - 711.48] there's some Alloys of mercury aluminum
[708.72 - 714.92] and copper there's some copper oxidizing
[711.48 - 718.24] right here okay you see this here
[714.92 - 721.04] right there we
[718.24 - 723.00] go so it's leeching now here's what
[721.04 - 725.44] happens when it leeches it leeches into
[723.00 - 728.00] adjacent tissue when it starts to leech
[725.44 - 729.68] into adjacent T tissue we start getting
[728.00 - 731.88] in big trouble because then it's
[729.68 - 734.12] spreading it's spreading into neuron to
[731.88 - 736.68] neuron to neuron and that's what toxic
[734.12 - 739.92] heavy metals do over time as we live our
[736.68 - 742.28] life the metals move they oxidize and
[739.92 - 745.24] they move and they start to spread and
[742.28 - 748.28] as they're spreading right as they're
[745.24 - 750.84] spreading they're leech they're leeching
[748.28 - 753.88] they're oxidizing they're out gassing
[750.84 - 756.36] that's what's happening they're out
[753.88 - 758.48] gassing and we end up getting in trouble
[756.36 - 761.80] so now tissue is actually being
[758.48 - 764.24] destroyed brain cells gal cells neurons
[761.80 - 766.60] are being affected metals are leeching
[764.24 - 770.76] they're oxidizing and they're branching
[766.60 - 775.08] over into gleo cells into other brain
[770.76 - 780.36] tissue exactly and into neurons when
[775.08 - 785.48] that happens our OCD heightens even our
[780.36 - 788.36] PTSD heightens our bipolar heightens our
[785.48 - 791.64] depersonalization heightens our anxiety
[788.36 - 795.24] heightens our depression heightens those
[791.64 - 798.64] are just some okay our schizophrenia
[795.24 - 802.04] heightens yes everything our Neurosis
[798.64 - 805.12] our psychosis anything else starts to
[802.04 - 807.20] advance itself right and so that's an
[805.12 - 808.64] example right there also other symptoms
[807.20 - 810.12] too we're going to go into autoimmune a
[808.64 - 812.36] little bit all kinds of other stuff
[810.12 - 814.32] around that how that works
[812.36 - 815.92] Christine I've been drinking you're over
[814.32 - 818.40] there on Facebook I've been drinking the
[815.92 - 822.00] heavy metal detox smoothie for 3 years
[818.40 - 825.88] every day it has been a game Cher as my
[822.00 - 830.92] thinking is so much more clear that is
[825.88 - 834.44] the most powerful metal remover there is
[830.92 - 836.84] safely and effectively gently without
[834.44 - 839.56] the side effects that's what that is
[836.84 - 841.72] from Spirit of compassion
[839.56 - 843.56] that heavy metal detox smoothie is
[841.72 - 846.76] saving lives around the world it has
[843.56 - 848.72] been for a very very long time I'm so
[846.76 - 851.56] glad you're using it the heavy metal
[848.72 - 853.60] detox is powerful and you don't have to
[851.56 - 855.88] have it in a smoothie just so you know
[853.60 - 858.36] you can have it in a bowl you can have
[855.88 - 860.60] it on your salad you can have it many
[858.36 - 862.36] different ways as long as you're getting
[860.60 - 864.92] three out of the five ingredients that
[862.36 - 867.12] are key but try to do five because
[864.92 - 869.08] that's the most powerful way of doing it
[867.12 - 870.76] you can separate the ingredients through
[869.08 - 872.52] throughout the day and you can have the
[870.76 - 874.04] five ingredients starting from the
[872.52 - 876.36] beginning of the day all the way to the
[874.04 - 878.48] end of the day you can do it that way
[876.36 - 880.76] but that's the heavy metal detox it's
[878.48 - 882.00] powerful it's lifechanging it's saving
[880.76 - 884.84] lives out there so let's talk about
[882.00 - 886.52] Metals a little bit longer and so glad
[884.84 - 888.56] you mention that if you guys just got

[1622.40 - 1625.20] passed down from generation to
[1623.68 - 1628.80] generation they sit inside of us in
[1625.20 - 1631.64] older Metals mm info all this metal info
[1628.80 - 1634.20] is MM info I mean just going back like
[1631.64 - 1637.12] even six years
[1634.20 - 1639.32] ago six years ago podcast doctors
[1637.12 - 1640.80] weren't talking about metals they were
[1639.32 - 1643.32] talking about eating better processed
[1640.80 - 1648.20] foods I don't know if you guys remember
[1643.32 - 1649.32] but back in 2018 17 16 15 all you would
[1648.20 - 1651.44] here is just about eating better and
[1649.32 - 1653.64] stay away from processed foods I don't
[1651.44 - 1655.84] know if you guys remember that right
[1653.64 - 1657.76] nobody knew that mercury caused anxiety
[1655.84 - 1659.68] and depression nobody knew that copper
[1657.76 - 1661.44] and aluminum caused you know all kinds
[1659.68 - 1663.44] of different issues nobody knew that
[1661.44 - 1665.32] ecem was caused by copper in the liver
[1663.44 - 1667.20] all medical medium information and what
[1665.32 - 1669.32] happened was the books got out and this
[1667.20 - 1671.16] book right here millions of this book
[1669.32 - 1673.44] got out around the world and this
[1671.16 - 1675.16] chapter right here blew people away and
[1673.44 - 1677.60] they learned how to do the heavy metal
[1675.16 - 1678.64] detox and when they learned how to do it
[1677.60 - 1680.24] they healed
[1678.64 - 1682.64] and when they healed they spread the
[1680.24 - 1684.76] word and guess what someone else got the
[1682.64 - 1687.36] book and healed and someone else got the
[1684.76 - 1689.60] book and healed right and then it got
[1687.36 - 1691.32] around and everybody was like ho ho ho
[1689.60 - 1692.80] all the health coaches and the podcast

[1870.76 - 1874.96] incredible all right we're going into
[1873.44 - 1876.32] some metal talk let's talk a little bit
[1874.96 - 1878.72] more I'm talking about how the metals
[1876.32 - 1881.56] move and how they contaminate more
[1878.72 - 1884.40] tissue gleo cells neurons and they
[1881.56 - 1886.00] contaminate as they move the metals move
[1884.40 - 1887.96] and they cause problems that's what
[1886.00 - 1889.60] happens to people it's really difficult
[1887.96 - 1891.72] and then guess what your symptoms crank
[1889.60 - 1893.68] up everything cranks up it gets very
[1891.72 - 1896.44] difficult gets very hard and that's what
[1893.68 - 1898.48] people go through and that is not easy
[1896.44 - 1900.20] not easy at all all right let's move a
[1898.48 - 1903.92] little bit through the
[1900.20 - 1906.24] information all right let's go Mercury
[1903.92 - 1909.04] for close to 2 200 years wait got
[1906.24 - 1912.88] another comment check this out on IG
[1909.04 - 1916.96] Barry gvy girl cool handle the hmds has
[1912.88 - 1919.24] helped relieve me of anxiety and panic
[1916.96 - 1921.32] attacks
[1919.24 - 1923.60] now I use it to protect me against the
[1921.32 - 1926.72] fragrances I'm exposed to every day
[1923.60 - 1927.96] that's acting as pathogenic fuel well
[1926.72 - 1931.16] here's what happens when you know
[1927.96 - 1935.76] information by the way um that's really
[1931.16 - 1938.80] powerful okay really powerful so um
[1935.76 - 1940.64] Julia check this out when you're using
[1938.80 - 1942.84] metals like that in those when you're
[1940.64 - 1944.40] using heavy metal detox smoothie like
[1942.84 - 1945.96] that and metals are getting into your
[1944.40 - 1948.76] system
[1945.96 - 1951.88] from that exposure those fragrances and
[1948.76 - 1954.16] so forth those fragrances become fresh
[1951.88 - 1955.72] they become fresh in the bloodstream and
[1954.16 - 1957.96] the heavy metal detox smoothie is doing
[1955.72 - 1961.16] two things at that point it's removing
[1957.96 - 1962.48] the fresh exposure the metals that come
[1961.16 - 1964.76] with the fragrance fragrances and
[1962.48 - 1966.44] everything it's removing the fresh
[1964.76 - 1969.12] Metals out of the bloodstream so they
[1966.44 - 1973.40] don't enter and stay and make homes
[1969.12 - 1977.00] right you guys and then the other aspect
[1973.40 - 1979.32] of the heavy metal detox is removing old
[1977.00 - 1981.32] stuff old stuff passed down from
[1979.32 - 1983.28] generation to generation to generation
[1981.32 - 1985.80] and it's grabbing onto that and pulling
[1983.28 - 1988.12] that out but it's doing two things it's
[1985.80 - 1990.32] eating up exposure so that's what
[1988.12 - 1994.16] happens so here's our brain right
[1990.32 - 1997.20] here and then here's brand new exposure
[1994.16 - 1999.80] okay so now you're somebody you're
[1997.20 - 2001.84] exposed you're breathing in fragrances
[1999.80 - 2004.84] and that exposure and that fragrance is
[2001.84 - 2006.88] is just floating around okay that's a
[2004.84 - 2008.92] good color for fragrances by the way
[2006.88 - 2010.76] it's a very good color
[2008.92 - 2014.72] all
[2010.76 - 2017.32] right and then we're breathing in right
[2014.72 - 2020.40] here those fragrances those fragrances
[2017.32 - 2023.40] are entering in the sinus cavities the
[2020.40 - 2025.64] bloodstream they're entering
[2023.40 - 2027.36] in and they're getting into the brain
[2025.64 - 2031.28] and body when you're doing the heavy
[2027.36 - 2034.60] metal detox every day you're
[2031.28 - 2037.96] absorbing and sucking all that up out of
[2034.60 - 2039.88] the bloodstream new exposure and you're
[2037.96 - 2041.72] getting rid of the new exposure because
[2039.88 - 2043.96] here's what happens to everybody the new
[2041.72 - 2046.80] exposure adds to the old
[2043.96 - 2050.60] exposure so let's talk about
[2046.80 - 2052.76] that the new exposure adds to the old
[2050.60 - 2055.60] exposure any new exposure from
[2052.76 - 2058.80] pesticides herbicides fungicides from
[2055.60 - 2060.32] fire okay retardant from all kinds of
[2058.80 - 2062.16] stuff that people are up against every
[2060.32 - 2063.80] single day from formal theid to
[2062.16 - 2067.00] chemicals that are pumping out of the
[2063.80 - 2069.36] walls of houses and apartments to Lawns
[2067.00 - 2071.28] being treated and sprayed to
[2069.36 - 2074.32] insecticides falling out of the sky when
[2071.28 - 2076.72] they do mosquito spraying all of it is
[2074.32 - 2078.88] entering into our bodies because that's
[2076.72 - 2081.04] life here on planet Earth we can't
[2078.88 - 2082.72] change that planet Earth but that's
[2081.04 - 2085.32] what's happening and as we're breathing
[2082.72 - 2086.72] all that in it's going into our
[2085.32 - 2088.20] bloodstream and if we're not being
[2086.72 - 2089.92] proactive if we're not doing the heavy
[2088.20 - 2093.20] metal detox and we're not taking care of
[2089.92 - 2096.72] ourselves that enters into our organs
[2093.20 - 2099.92] like the brain and then it joins in with
[2096.72 - 2103.52] metal pre previously there metal finds
[2099.92 - 2106.92] metal metal looks for Metal By the way
[2103.52 - 2110.24] metal loves metal that's what it does
[2106.92 - 2114.76] Pockets get bigger and bigger and bigger
[2110.24 - 2118.44] they expand more more more more exposure
[2114.76 - 2122.12] Comes In Pockets get bigger more
[2118.44 - 2124.68] exposure Comes In Pockets get bigger
[2122.12 - 2126.44] over time you don't know where you are
[2124.68 - 2128.08] you don't know who you are there's a
[2126.44 - 2129.92] rise of all kinds of things is happening
[2128.08 - 2131.32] not just brain fog but a rise of like
[2129.92 - 2132.56] memory loss and everything else where
[2131.32 - 2134.08] people are having episodes they don't
[2132.56 - 2136.04] even know people are walking down the
[2134.08 - 2138.24] street their underwear now they have no
[2136.04 - 2140.88] idea what they're doing that's happening
[2138.24 - 2143.12] because of years of this expansion of
[2140.88 - 2144.88] pockets getting bigger metals never
[2143.12 - 2147.24] coming out nobody's doing the heavy
[2144.88 - 2149.96] metal detox in that situation and
[2147.24 - 2152.52] they're not getting the stuff out
[2149.96 - 2154.96] cristelle over there on YouTube had CT
[2152.52 - 2157.36] scan today and picking up ingredients
[2154.96 - 2159.44] for radiation exposure brain shot I love
[2157.36 - 2162.60] that brain shot it's an incredible brain
[2159.44 - 2165.24] shot it's reassuring and empowering

[2207.52 - 2214.00] wisdom was Mercury oh yeah that's right
[2211.76 - 2216.96] source for the Eternal wisdom in ancient
[2214.00 - 2218.96] Chinese medicine Mercury was so revered
[2216.96 - 2221.84] that countless Emperors died for mercury
[2218.96 - 2223.68] Elixir that healers vowed would end all
[2221.84 - 2226.72] their problems which I guess you could
[2223.68 - 2228.52] say they did if you take a morbid view
[2226.72 - 2230.96] of
[2228.52 - 2233.72] things but they've been using mercury
[2230.96 - 2236.32] worldwide everywhere Mercury wasn't only

[2737.40 - 2743.80] thank you back Leslie thank you
[2740.44 - 2744.96] back all right okay I want to talk a
[2743.80 - 2746.64] little bit about Mercury for a couple
[2744.96 - 2752.24] more minutes because I know some people
[2746.64 - 2754.16] they love Mercury info love it okay all
[2752.24 - 2756.60] right the treatment was especially
[2754.16 - 2758.96] common method to force a miscarriage
[2756.60 - 2761.96] Mercury to force a miscarriage and to
[2758.96 - 2763.80] treat what was labeled as female
[2761.96 - 2766.68] hysteria a lot of reasons for
[2763.80 - 2769.52] miscarriages every single day is mercury
[2766.68 - 2772.80] every single day women have storage bins
[2769.52 - 2775.12] of mercury storage bins of metals from
[2772.80 - 2778.04] generation to generation to generation
[2775.12 - 2781.08] and metals move can have one baby and
[2778.04 - 2784.64] then now you have a miscarriage because
[2781.08 - 2787.60] Metals move and they gravitate they
[2784.64 - 2790.60] actually move and spread
[2787.60 - 2793.60] okay the 19th century wasn't exactly the
[2790.60 - 2795.72] Stone Age it had been established that
[2793.60 - 2798.08] mercury was a dangerous toxin that
[2795.72 - 2800.16] destroyed life they didn't know really
[2798.08 - 2803.24] what it did besides it killed you if you
[2800.16 - 2805.44] had too much of it if you played with it
[2803.24 - 2807.64] and ate a big hunk of it for centuries
[2805.44 - 2810.12] already people had born witnessed to the
[2807.64 - 2812.72] millions who died from Mercury exposure
[2810.12 - 2815.12] so why was it still favored still
[2812.72 - 2817.92] favored one factor was the great
[2815.12 - 2823.28] industrial demon that sat behind Mercury
[2817.92 - 2827.80] did you hear that a great demon yes a
[2823.28 - 2829.84] great big demon that sat behind the
[2827.80 - 2832.28] Mercury
[2829.84 - 2835.88] industry that alone was enough for it to
[2832.28 - 2838.84] be pushed as the top cure all
[2835.88 - 2841.76] Trend there were interest groups pushing
[2838.84 - 2844.60] it Forward interest groups that had evil
[2841.76 - 2847.16] and darkness behind them that would push
[2844.60 - 2850.12] Mercury and the use of mercury and push
[2847.16 - 2852.76] it into guess what
[2850.12 - 2855.40] Pharmaceuticals and push it into other
[2852.76 - 2857.12] things it's
[2855.40 - 2859.96] crazy
[2857.12 - 2862.04] yep the Mercury movement finally hit a
[2859.96 - 2865.96] speed bump in the mid
[2862.04 - 2868.36] 1800s doctors had become more accessible
[2865.96 - 2870.16] than ever before in history to people
[2868.36 - 2872.68] from all walks of life which seemed like
[2870.16 - 2874.64] a good thing yet in increasing numbers
[2872.68 - 2877.80] of people went to visit these new
[2874.64 - 2879.36] medical graduates Observers caught on
[2877.80 - 2881.68] that more and more of these patients
[2879.36 - 2885.08] were coming down with uncontrollable
[2881.68 - 2888.80] shaking fevers Madness rage body ticks
[2885.08 - 2891.00] jerking gibberish talk gibberish talk it
[2888.80 - 2893.60] became obvious that a visit to the
[2891.00 - 2897.00] doctor could result in poisoning so in
[2893.60 - 2899.68] the 1800s it was figured out yeah it was
[2897.00 - 2902.52] figured out that mercury was causing so
[2899.68 - 2904.96] many problems in the Pharmaceuticals in
[2902.52 - 2907.28] the drugs in the Mercury Elixir Mercury
[2904.96 - 2908.96] was causing so much trouble back in that
[2907.28 - 2911.60] day in the
[2908.96 - 2913.96] 1800s for example a wife and mother of
[2911.60 - 2917.00] five might have sent her husband to the
[2913.96 - 2919.08] doctor to help the husband with his gout
[2917.00 - 2922.20] upon arriving home her husband would be
[2919.08 - 2924.52] delusional yelling out children's Rhymes
[2922.20 - 2926.68] as his eyes twitched after just one
[2924.52 - 2929.32] experience like this a family would say
[2926.68 - 2931.92] we have had enough following this
[2929.32 - 2934.40] widespread realization there was a
[2931.92 - 2937.28] 25-year ghost town period for medical
[2934.40 - 2938.40] businesses did you guys know that in the
[2937.28 - 2940.92] late
[2938.40 - 2943.12] 1800s there was a
[2940.92 - 2945.88] 25e
[2943.12 - 2949.80] absence of no one going to the medical
[2945.88 - 2954.32] doctors anymore 25 years a medical
[2949.80 - 2957.44] doctor barely saw a patient in their
[2954.32 - 2959.88] tenure whatever you call
[2957.44 - 2961.80] it they knew that a visit to the doctor
[2959.88 - 2963.88] would lead into mercury poisoning
[2961.80 - 2967.28] medical universities hit their all-time
[2963.88 - 2968.28] low funding and were broken by busted by
[2967.28 - 2971.76] the late
[2968.28 - 2975.12] 1800s this is this is sick
[2971.76 - 2978.96] information right Michael Charles on
[2975.12 - 2981.80] YouTube right there CJ and heavy metal
[2978.96 - 2983.00] detox smoothie got me back on my feet
[2981.80 - 2986.24] symptom
[2983.00 - 2988.68] free you're awesome bro you're awesome
[2986.24 - 2990.96] okay this was exactly the break that
[2988.68 - 2993.04] natural practitioners and healers needed
[2990.96 - 2995.40] to gain some credibility for the first
[2993.04 - 2997.84] brief time in history practically in
[2995.40 - 2999.92] modern history or early forms of Home
[2997.84 - 3001.68] Homeopathy chiropractic treatment and
[2999.92 - 3005.12] other varieties of alternative medicine
[3001.68 - 3007.52] exploded in popularity by 1900 finally
[3005.12 - 3009.08] traditional doctors offices caught on
[3007.52 - 3012.56] and started advertising that they were
[3009.08 - 3014.36] no longer carrying Quicksilver
[3012.56 - 3017.08] Quicks that's what they called it
[3014.36 - 3019.24] Quicksilver liquid mercury drinks and
[3017.08 - 3021.64] traditional medicine gained back some
[3019.24 - 3023.88] credibility because they dropped the
[3021.64 - 3026.88] Mercury so medical schools were starting
[3023.88 - 3028.76] to get students once more again in there
[3026.88 - 3030.16] and patients were starting to go back to
[3028.76 - 3033.32] doctors
[3030.16 - 3035.04] again finally traditional doctor offices
[3033.32 - 3037.72] caught on and started advertising that
[3035.04 - 3040.64] they no longer offered Mercury Elixir
[3037.72 - 3042.32] anymore Mercury Quicksilver Elixir and
[3040.64 - 3045.32] traditional medicine gained back that
[3042.32 - 3048.84] credibility like I said yet the demon
[3045.32 - 3052.48] behind mercury still wanted the
[3048.84 - 3056.72] population to get plenty of exposure the
[3052.48 - 3059.92] demon behind mercury still wanted to use
[3056.72 - 3062.00] to get Mercury so inventive ways were
[3059.92 - 3065.20] created and figured out so you got
[3062.00 - 3067.32] mercury in you not only were Industries
[3065.20 - 3069.28] dumping mercury into every river lake
[3067.32 - 3071.84] and Waterway possible but other forms of
[3069.28 - 3073.60] mercury containing medicine were born by
[3071.84 - 3076.04] the turn of the 20th century plus
[3073.60 - 3078.76] dentists were still using mercury malum
[3076.04 - 3081.08] fillings and that's just the start baby
[3078.76 - 3084.44] that's just the start over there on

[3173.00 - 3179.92] life I'm now symptom free from high
[3176.92 - 3182.72] blood pressure cholesterol and thyroid
[3179.92 - 3187.56] the hmds and celery juice changed my
[3182.72 - 3187.56] life forever that's incredible that's
[3188.24 - 3194.52] incredible that's incredible even got
[3191.12 - 3196.60] your cholesterol back to where it should
[3194.52 - 3199.60] be it's
[3196.60 - 3203.44] amazing because it's the dirty
[3199.60 - 3205.64] secret why am I going to tell you why am
[3203.44 - 3207.84] I going on like this about Mercury
[3205.64 - 3209.48] Mercury Mercury
[3207.84 - 3211.20] because it's the dirty secret we're not
[3209.48 - 3213.16] supposed to talk about and we have
[3211.20 - 3215.16] mercury in our brains and bodies from
[3213.16 - 3217.92] generations of ancestors who are exposed
[3215.16 - 3220.12] to it you're not supposed to know about
[3217.92 - 3223.28] what mercury has done to shape history
[3220.12 - 3224.80] and you're certainly certainly not
[3223.28 - 3227.92] supposed to know what mercury has done
[3224.80 - 3229.84] to you on any level right up to this
[3227.92 - 3233.16] present moment Mercury can be toxic even
[3229.84 - 3235.80] in tiny dosages you can't see you can't
[3233.16 - 3238.44] see it and there's no hazard sign saying
[3235.80 - 3238.44] beware
[3239.68 - 3244.04] Mercury if it were up to the Mercury
[3242.00 - 3245.92] demon he would think Mercury was
[3244.04 - 3248.48] harmless even good for us better yet
[3245.92 - 3250.92] Mercury would be entirely
[3248.48 - 3253.08] hidden and we wouldn't even know it
[3250.92 - 3256.08] existed Mercury never goes away unless
[3253.08 - 3260.84] you take specific steps to detoxify it
[3256.08 - 3263.60] and get it out Mercury casts an evil in
[3260.84 - 3268.36] soulless shadow that has engulfed so
[3263.60 - 3268.36] many and destroyed so many lives
[3269.36 - 3275.32] this toxic heavy metal becomes a part of
[3271.96 - 3280.04] us and that reflects itself in our
[3275.32 - 3282.44] health greed carelessness darkness and
[3280.04 - 3285.72] ignorance are the major factors that
[3282.44 - 3289.00] have allowed Mercury to prey on the
[3285.72 - 3292.00] population a Mercury mind owner of the
[3289.00 - 3295.00] past likely didn't care if workers only
[3292.00 - 3297.60] live 6 months to 3 years after starting
[3295.00 - 3301.84] at the mine the Mercury mine because
[3297.60 - 3305.12] there was money to be made money to be
[3301.84 - 3307.48] had what good has mercury ever done none
[3305.12 - 3309.92] it's said nothing good for us absolutely
[3307.48 - 3312.48] nothing it's an unnecessary dangerous
[3309.92 - 3314.84] neurotoxin it could have been replaced
[3312.48 - 3318.76] in its medical and Industrial uses with
[3314.84 - 3322.20] something safer but no and I'll tell you
[3318.76 - 3325.48] why because the Mercury demon for some
[3322.20 - 3326.88] reason has a grip on the hierarchy on
[3325.48 - 3329.32] this planet
[3326.88 - 3332.52] especially the hierarchy that loves
[3329.32 - 3335.28] pharmaceutical world and that hierarchy
[3332.52 - 3337.80] wants Mercury sprinkled about in it it
[3335.28 - 3341.36] wants mercury in a
