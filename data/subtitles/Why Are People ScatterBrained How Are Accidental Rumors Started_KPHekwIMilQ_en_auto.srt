1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,500
here we are again talking about brain

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,980
saver the brain saver book's gonna read

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,540
in the chapter called Static brain it's

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,759
about scatter brains you know anybody

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,740
who's scatterbrained like you know what

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,480
are you scatterbrained you hear that a

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,640
lot right A lot of people have said that

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,939
over the years that's a term

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,560
so there's a network of neurons inside

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,779
your brain

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,039
that need to be clean and healthy and

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,740
pure

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,440
they need to be

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,260
in good standing so the neurons inside

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,300
our brain are not supposed to be

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,700
polluted they're not supposed to be

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,940
corrupted and polluted and saturated

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,059
with all kinds of waste and sludge and

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,620
Gunk and toxins and poisons but what

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:56,160
happens is in our lives we have brains

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,260
that become like a filter and they're

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,940
saturated with all kinds of toxins

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,219
poisons all kinds of junk and garbage

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,719
and waste and everything else byproduct

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,180
everything right

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,040
and so our brains have all this stuff in

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,560
it that's not supposed to be in there

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,740
and when that stuff is in there and it's

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,720
saturating the neurons of your brain

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,939
then all of a sudden we become scatter

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,619
brains and anything can go wrong even

32
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,119
accidental rumors could happen I'm going

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,340
to read a little bit about that it's so

34
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,960
cool in here so this is mind-blowing

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,520
information you guys

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,380
the books are on sale right now

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,100
amazon.com us

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,380
take advantage of it if you can take

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,820
advantage of it the very heavy the books

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,400
good to see you guys again very heavy

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,979
the books loaded with information and a

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,320
forewarning to you too there's so much

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,619
to digest there's so much information to

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
take in it's insane how much line for

45
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,299
line it is absolutely incredible and I'm

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,420
just gonna be I'm just gonna be farting

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,159
around in your static brain right here

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,200
and

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm not even talking about the amount of

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,159
information the anxiety chapter and the

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,719
Alzheimer's chapter in the bipolar

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,119
chapter in the OCB chapter and the

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,280
eating disorder chapter that's just a

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,560
few things there's symptoms conditions

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,000
and explanations and incredible

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,099
information so this is groundbreaking

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,739
information that's not known out there I

58
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,540
want to make that clear because

59
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,940
you know I saw somebody earlier make a

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,940
comment like oh he must be just reading

61
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,599
all the latest Neuroscience really that

62
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,340
must be a genius or something okay or

63
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,080
you know spiritual compassion is a

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,599
genius or whatever you want to say but

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,220
this isn't the latest Neuroscience you

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,020
know Neuroscience doesn't have this

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,180
information this is far more advanced

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,620
than our Neuroscience today as far as

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,620
what's out there

70
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,200
and which is incredible so this is

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,800
Advanced this will become

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,379
the latest Neuroscience it will because

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,140
already information for medical medium

74
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,260
throughout the last 10 10 years and even

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,540
before has become Staples in the

76
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,400
Neuroscience world and I even talk about

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,519
some of that in here

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,400
so about how you know I published it

79
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,440
first and whatever so I'm just going in

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,300
here into static brain the most advanced

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,659
comprehensive detailed information about

82
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,659
how our brain works is in these two

83
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,120
books brain saver brain saver protocols

84
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,860
so take a look when you get the chance

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,360
these books are so good Sherry said good

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,879
to see you these books are so good I'm

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,800
honored I'm so glad you have the books

88
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,420
and let's get into it a little bit you

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,300
guys

90
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,300
so your static brain so I'm on page 10

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,060
of this massive book

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,680
and there's two books remember that

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,620
some of you like which book do I get

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,319
there's two books they become one big

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,239
book so I'm in a network of neurons I'm

96
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,420
reading right out of here so each line

97
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,280
is packed and powerful and filled with

98
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,400
information

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,819
when it comes to your brain

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,860
neurons mean practically everything

101
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,540
healing brain related symptoms and

102
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,220
conditions whether those symptoms and

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,680
conditions are traditionally associated

104
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,659
with the brain or not

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,400
critically depends on understanding the

106
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,160
neurons that reside inside of it so if

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,600
we don't understand our neurons inside

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,740
our brain

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,860
we can't heal our brain we cannot heal

110
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,960
so if we don't understand our neurons we

111
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,240
can't understand what's wrong with us we

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,240
can't understand our brain it's critical

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,040
neurons a type of nerve tissue

114
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,560
are the means by which communication

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,720
occurs in the nervous system enabling it

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,820
to send and receive messages neurons are

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,680
about input and output so your neurons

118
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,720
inside your brain are about information

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,699
going in information going out

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,780
information going in information going

121
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,919
out

122
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,520
neurons are your transcribers

123
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,400
that's your transcription method

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,860
so your neurons are your transcribers to

125
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,340
information coming in

126
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,759
that's what they are

127
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,440
imagine okay

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,560
imagine

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
billions of tiny people inside your

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
brain

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,020
can you imagine that

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,020
billions of tiny people inside our brain

133
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,479
each sitting at a desk in front of a

134
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,180
computer

135
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,000
translating information that's coming in

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,300
through your ears or eyes or other

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,680
senses such as smell taste or touch and

138
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,320
trying to decipher it so imagine

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,039
billions of tiny little people inside

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
your brain

141
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,020
the neuron transcriber's job is to make

142
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,300
sense out of what you're experiencing

143
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,000
and then pass that along to the next

144
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,600
tiny neuron person inside your brain

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,960
the hope is that a the information

146
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,539
travels uninterrupted and that's the key

147
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,759
uninterrupted that's the key so I'm

148
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,440
getting someplace right now check this

149
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,440
out travels uninterrupted

150
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,979
the hope is that a the information

151
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,380
travels uninterrupted to that next

152
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:26,280
transcriber neuron

153
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,620
and B that next transcriber neuron

154
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,100
takes the information that was just

155
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,259
deciphered keeps it in purified form and

156
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,780
possibly adds an addendum that's

157
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,360
efficient and accurate and prepares it

158
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,880
for the next tiny person neuron inside

159
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
your brain to receive

160
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,259
so you got this transcriber which is a

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
neuron receiving information through

162
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,720
electricity

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,759
and then

164
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,759
transcribing it organizing it and

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,300
sending it back out if the neurons

166
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,400
are not interrupted but everybody's

167
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,680
walking around with brain problems

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
everybody's walking around with a brain

169
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,419
issue and they're sick in all kinds of

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,699
different ways so something's getting

171
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,840
interrupted something inside their head

172
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,840
is getting interrupted

173
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,259
aren't these aren't these fun to do you

174
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,240
guys

175
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,240
so let's let's keep on going here

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,460
you can imagine

177
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,860
your brain as a tiny spaceship

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,400
so imagine your brain is this tiny

179
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,400
spaceship

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,180
flying through the universe that's

181
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,680
pretty cool that's really cool

182
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,860
your neurons are billions of tiny aliens

183
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,759
inside that spaceship so your neurons

184
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:53,639
are tiny aliens billions of them inside

185
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,740
your spaceship right

186
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,880
so your brain

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,880
is a spaceship

188
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,860
and you got billions of type poor grogu

189
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,080
grow grogu's being used as an example

190
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,340
tonight you got billions of tiny little

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,340
aliens inside your brain

192
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,319
and all of these aliens

193
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,599
are communicating together

194
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,020
at the same time there's a Supreme Being

195
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,860
oh whoa whoa whoa at the same time

196
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,520
there's a Supreme Being

197
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,620
on the ship watching all of it so you

198
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,080
got your brain as a spaceship it's got

199
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,820
billions of tiny aliens inside of it

200
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,979
communicating with each other and

201
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,719
there's a supreme being inside that

202
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,000
spaceship that's strange

203
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,140
what's the Supreme Being inside that

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,019
spaceship what is it what can it be

205
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,500
so you have the Supreme supernatural

206
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:58,560
being that's sitting inside the

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
spaceship watching over all those

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,540
billions of tiny aliens communicating

209
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,720
inside there

210
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:10,459
that Supreme Being is your soul

211
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,459
that's your soul

212
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,260
your sensory input isn't the only

213
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,640
information your neurons decipher and

214
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,180
pass along they also translate

215
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,519
information about your body processes

216
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,260
neurons apply to every single function

217
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,459
your body has and how healthy your

218
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,339
neurons

219
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:33,120
are determined on how comfortable you're

220
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,940
going to be in your mind and body

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,580
that is neurons are involved you guys

222
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,019
got your books I'm on page 12. you guys

223
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,019
will probably read it better than I can

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,320
so

225
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,420
that is neurons are involved in both

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,420
mental functioning and your state of

227
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,420
health so neurons involved with your

228
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,279
mental health

229
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,880
mental health not just physical health

230
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,620
mental health and physical health

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
when you have brain related symptoms

232
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,060
even on the mildest scale such as mild

233
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,100
fatigue and Mild brain fog It's really

234
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,440
because neurons can't transfer

235
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,060
information properly to the next group

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,060
of neurons

237
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,339
so if you've got brain fog

238
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,019
or anything like brain fog It's really

239
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,899
because neurons can't transfer

240
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,820
information properly to the next group

241
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,100
of neurons something is hindering the

242
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,260
pathway where the electricity is

243
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,060
traveling so as electricity is traveling

244
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,959
through your brain something is

245
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,600
hindering the passageways the pathway

246
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,100
something's in the way he had all these

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,779
people with brain fog and every kind of

248
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,540
problem and all these other issues

249
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,700
what's going on something is actually

250
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,300
impeding the information traveling

251
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,000
across to neuron to neuron

252
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,760
something is blocking or otherwise

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
impeding the pathway within the synapsis

254
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,459
so the neurons sending out electrical

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
impulses are not reaching other neurons

256
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,940
that need the information we're not

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,740
reaching the neurons as intended so

258
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,880
what's happening is you got all these

259
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,240
people man

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,100
she's just walking around

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,660
they're seeing their psychiatrists their

262
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,760
doctors their MDS their functional

263
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,980
medicine doctors their therapists their

264
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,019
counselors they're depressed they got

265
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,720
anxiety they got to personalization they

266
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,880
got bipolar diagnoses

267
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,160
they got depression in the worst way

268
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
different ranges they got dementia and

269
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,620
Alzheimer's if you want to add those in

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,480
they got all kinds of different issues

271
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,640
they're triggered easy they're emotional

272
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,920
emotionally sensitive all these things

273
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,019
but there's real problems it's not their

274
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,200
fault

275
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,200
foreign

276
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,220
you can see this in everyday life when

277
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,680
you're telling someone a story about

278
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,000
apples and they and they find out that

279
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,140
the whole time you find out the whole

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
time they thought you were talking about

281
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,040
oranges

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
so you're telling somebody a story and

283
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,320
you're talking you're talking about

284
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,760
apples you're like this apple tree is

285
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,959
incredible and then by the time you're

286
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,260
done they're like what was that orange

287
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,260
tree

288
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,420
right any kind of a p impedement within

289
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,399
a person's neurons can mean that the

290
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,680
information their neurons process gets

291
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,660
altered affecting that person's ability

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,820
to focus listen or properly receive

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,680
information from a conversation or story

294
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
so here's how it works you're

295
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,019
conversating with somebody you're

296
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,300
talking to somebody and you're not

297
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,800
getting along like you know

298
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,920
something's happening in that

299
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,260
relationship something's going wrong no

300
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,880
one's seeing eye to eye it could be a

301
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,440
couple it could be a relationship could

302
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,480
be family members it could be friends

303
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,740
but you're not seeing eye to eye it

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,240
could be somebody you just met on the

305
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,800
street but you're not seeing eye to eye

306
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,380
and you don't know why you're not seeing

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,060
eye to eye what is wrong what is going

308
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,680
on here

309
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,360
there's a good chance it's because that

310
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,940
person you're not seeing eye to eye with

311
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,160
has got an impedement in the neurons and

312
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,760
that information going through is being

313
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,760
blocked

314
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,040
a lot of people don't actually hear what

315
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,320
I said or what's in my books it happens

316
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,880
all the time you see it out there people

317
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,339
say he didn't say that and I did or

318
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,220
he said this and I didn't

319
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:23,399
I've seen that for years on social media

320
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,680
people have problems with their neurons

321
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,260
and so when they read the medical medium

322
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,940
books sometimes they don't it's hard to

323
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,880
get the information in I've seen this

324
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,440
it's why it's critical to do the cleanup

325
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
so many people don't read things

326
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,380
correctly either or hear things

327
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,779
correctly because their neurons are

328
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,420
having problems

329
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,440
so we have billions of people on this

330
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,220
planet

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,760
and they all got brain problems

332
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,440
it's easy to have

333
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,700
it's nobody's fault in the end except

334
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,740
the industries

335
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,980
an evil

336
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,620
because they want everybody just

337
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,839
scrambled eggs in the brain

338
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,260
but what happens is when we get when our

339
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
brains get too many toxins and poisons

340
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,860
and junk and metals and everything else

341
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,440
and pathogens and pathogen toxins inside

342
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,279
of our brain it becomes this filter and

343
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,540
then

344
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,540
we get scatterbrained

345
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,620
misread initial question guess I need

346
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,620
brain saver so that come up

347
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,420
Nobody's Perfect

348
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,980
Nobody's Perfect

349
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,600
there's a lot of people suffering and

350
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,880
struggling with their brain and I'd love

351
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,100
to see people get better I would love to

352
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,100
see them get better so badly

353
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,720
then that person may tell someone else

354
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,120
in entirely different version of the

355
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,160
original story that was told to them

356
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,500
you ever had that happen like you tell

357
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,480
somebody a story and they change the

358
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,519
story as they tell somebody else's Story

359
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,100
how crazy is that and it's not that it's

360
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,500
crazy it just happens but think about

361
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,839
that you tell somebody a story you're

362
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,699
like hey look I'm telling you this is

363
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,740
what happened I got this this you got

364
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,019
this yeah you got that okay great go

365
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,100
okay and they go tell somebody and

366
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,380
they're telling somebody and they're

367
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,940
like you know the the guy had this and

368
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,459
he fell off the cliff and next thing you

369
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,459
know it he he broke his leg I didn't

370
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,620
break my leg I I sprained an ankle but

371
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,779
everybody's confused the story go gets

372
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,920
passed on down the line and passed down

373
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,199
the line

374
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,519
and it gets completely

375
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,199
right dismantled and

376
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,160
deconstructed and reconstructed and it

377
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,160
goes on Down the Line

378
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,420
Chris it says telephone

379
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,339
I'll have to get the telephone

380
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,600
this is how gossip and rumors can be

381
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,600
twisted and turned into hearsay

382
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,660
the game telephone

383
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,899
so this is how gossip and rumors can be

384
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,600
twisted and turned into hearsay as the

385
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,399
story goes from person to person

386
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,139
it goes through each person's

387
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,300
contaminated impeded blocked or

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,800
diminished neurons and the story changes

389
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,199
dude

390
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,880
it goes through everybody's contaminated

391
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,300
neurons

392
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,920
so the stories changing and it turns

393
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,120
into this different story and this

394
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
different story and this different story

395
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,380
and it goes down the line and when it

396
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,959
reaches another person

397
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,060
it can get twisted up again

398
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,339
this can happen on the most basic level

399
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,779
and it can happen on even the hierarchy

400
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,779
on this planet as well

401
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:46,320
people that run this planet

402
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,699
don't have pure neurons

403
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,980
where they're

404
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,779
completely uncorrupted

405
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,579
they don't have any toxins poisons

406
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,500
metals and junk and pharmaceuticals and

407
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,060
everything else in their neurons so when

408
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,160
they hear the story they get it all

409
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,800
right

410
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,839
people that run this world have this

411
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,339
problem too and what comes out of their

412
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,079
mouth is all twisted up but the problem

413
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,520
is everybody pays the price when they

414
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,559
don't get their stories right and the

415
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,559
information right crazy how it works

416
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,179
Matt says definitely need to read

417
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,780
them and re-read them and reread them

418
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:24,439
and reread them one more time incredible

419
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,439
thank you Matt

420
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,160
look I've been schooled by Spirit of

421
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,260
compassion big time on these books

422
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,960
every single word that went into the

423
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,299
books SOC would be like

424
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
gotta add this gotta add this you gotta

425
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,140
add that you got to fix this this is

426
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
what it is this exact word

427
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,100
and man I was schooled and I had to

428
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,660
learn

429
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,260
still learning I have to read the books

430
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,260
over and over again

431
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,799
scattered brains

432
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,020
as electricity travels through an

433
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,059
impeded neuron system it can become

434
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,980
diminished meaning that electricity

435
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,320
within the brain is no longer traveling

436
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,940
at its full capacity

437
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,880
so as electricity is running through

438
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,660
your brain it no longer runs at that

439
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,660
capacity

440
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,539
that is a group of neurons can receive a

441
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,340
fully charged electrical impulse and

442
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,100
then in the process of assimilating and

443
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,960
registering that electricity

444
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,760
which is filled with information and

445
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,500
sending it through the synapsis to

446
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,700
another group of neurons electricity can

447
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,799
be diminished so here's how it goes

448
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,720
you've got a full power source boom

449
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
electricity you got full electricity

450
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,340
going through your brain and then it

451
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,100
hits the contaminated neuron bam and

452
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,160
then it diminishes

453
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,020
that's how it works

454
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,580
you got some electricity to get super

455
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,500
powered that electricity it's running

456
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,020
good in here but then it's moving over

457
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,880
to here you guys it's moving over and as

458
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,280
it's moving over it hits a contaminated

459
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,570
part of our brain it goes boom and all

460
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,419
of a sudden it diminishes

461
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,660
[Music]

462
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,600
Mateo Mr Taco says I thought they were

463
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,760
just extremely extremely emotional

464
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,559
they're just too emotional that's what

465
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,720
it is

466
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,880
go see a counselor you're too emotional

467
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,100
now there's real problems why we're so

468
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,480
emotional and when we get hurt

469
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,100
emotionally listen here's what's

470
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,500
incredible about the brain saver books

471
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,460
if you've been hurt emotionally mentally

472
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,980
like mentally damaged from abuse

473
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,160
emotional damn emotionally damaged

474
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,220
from abuse and hardship and loss it does

475
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,440
something to our brain physically which

476
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,480
is medical medium information because

477
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,760
you know Neuroscience doesn't know that

478
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,160
this is all originally unique

479
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,340
information in these books

480
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:49,559
from first page to the last page

481
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:52,740
and our brains can emotionally

482
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,660
get injured but physically injured from

483
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,360
an emotional occurrence physically

484
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,580
injured and then impediment happens and

485
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,380
then we're sensitive Vivian says oh my

486
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,660
God yes I have that

487
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,160
happen in the grocery store I was

488
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,860
telling a lady something and she

489
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,780
repeated a whole other story I was

490
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,760
confused I didn't say anything back to

491
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,140
her out of respect I never understood

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,600
what happened

493
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,460
you were talking about apples

494
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,260
and after you're done and you really

495
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,000
explained that story probably a really

496
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,400
great top-notch

497
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,960
the lady said

498
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,740
what

499
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,740
oranges

500
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,760
foreign

501
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,480
with electricity is something that's

502
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,480
mysterious

503
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,980
and not understood the truth is that

504
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,840
electricity isn't just electricity so

505
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,340
medical research in science doesn't know

506
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,660
that electricity in your brain holds

507
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,280
information did you guys know that

508
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,919
that's medical medium information it's

509
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,900
in the brain saver books they don't know

510
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,940
they don't know how the brain holds

511
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,500
information they have no idea

512
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,260
so research in science the best

513
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,480
Neuroscience out there does not know how

514
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,620
your brain holds information like where

515
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,620
is it they don't know

516
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,080
the electricity in your brain that's

517
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,720
swimming around that's flying around and

518
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,980
rotating is carrying

519
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,980
the information

520
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,780
it's information traveling within the

521
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,179
electricity kind of how we use

522
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,679
technology today a thought is not just

523
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,720
something that resides within the

524
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,000
neurons and glial cells the brain tissue

525
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,700
and stays there a thought can travel

526
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,100
with the electricity that leaves a

527
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,200
neuron electricity can carry tremendous

528
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,960
amounts of thoughts Ronnie says this is

529
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,240
brand new information yay thanks

530
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,240
it is it is the brain saver books

531
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:02,220
it's the brain saver books ready ripe

532
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,659
for poaching from podcast doctors like

533
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,860
the other books and everything else and

534
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,559
they won't cite it back to Medical

535
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,340
medium I know I say that a lot but

536
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,340
it's sad

537
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,919
because what's going to happen is

538
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,740
someone's gonna be like whoa whoa doctor

539
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,020
podcast guy that was an amazing piece of

540
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,600
information you must be so smart I'm

541
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,740
gonna buy your Apple Cider gummies and

542
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,299
your diatomaceous earth charcoal powder

543
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,640
you know whatever and all your other

544
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,740
stuff and your whey protein powder and

545
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,020
all that because you must be so smart to

546
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,179
have that advanced information what's

547
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,340
happening is Dr podcast guy's not saying

548
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,760
where you got it from so people could

549
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:45,140
find out what to avoid and also be

550
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,140
cautious about at the same time

551
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm trying not to be too snarky today

552
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,700
you guys

553
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,299
because the people can't find their way

554
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,260
back to heal that's why I'm Starkey

555
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,100
because

556
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,100
it's sad

557
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,380
electricity traveling through the brain

558
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,840
can carry information you won't or don't

559
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,340
use so electricity going through your

560
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,020
brain can carry information you're never

561
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,659
gonna even use you're not even going to

562
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,179
access man it's there for the taking

563
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,280
within the electricity so how do we take

564
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,980
that information out of electricity you

565
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,280
got electricity going through your brain

566
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,919
going through and it's information you

567
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,559
may never use ever ever you're receiving

568
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,760
but you'll never use it a bird chirps up

569
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,500
here you're not going to use that

570
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,820
information a squirrel makes a noise

571
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,059
over here you're not going to use that

572
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,020
information of you know an eagle flies

573
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,000
through the sky you're not going to use

574
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,559
that information anything going around

575
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,820
you your brain could be picking up the

576
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,039
electricity fills up with that

577
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,059
information a horn blows way over here

578
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,240
but you're not going to use the

579
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,240
information

580
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,820
we're trying to tell someone something

581
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,940
that we're getting from that electricity

582
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,159
and at the same time

583
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,840
leaving out information within that

584
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,280
electricity as well so here it is you're

585
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,020
trying to tell somebody like look I

586
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
gotta tell you I'm trying to tell you

587
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,080
something I'm trying to understand what

588
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,520
happened happened and electricity has

589
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,260
all this information and in your brain

590
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,940
but you can't get all of it out of the

591
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,320
electricity so you can't even tell the

592
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,330
person everything you wanted to tell

593
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,460
them

594
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,460
[Applause]

595
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,780
this is extremely Advanced unique

596
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,580
information so everybody knows I have to

597
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,559
put that disclaimer out constantly

598
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,860
someone new could come on here and be

599
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,860
like oh

600
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,539
we may feel there was something more to

601
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,740
say yet we don't know what it really was

602
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,760
you ever have something on the tip of

603
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,799
your tongue

604
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,919
it's on the tip of my tongue

605
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,780
it's on the tip of my tongue I gotta

606
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,059
tell you I can't remember what is that I

607
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,280
was gonna tell you something it was

608
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,600
there a second ago I have to tell you I

609
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,980
want to tell you I just don't know what

610
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
it is it'll come later it'll hit me

611
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,140
later

612
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,140
maybe it'll hit me later

613
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,299
it has already passed by us our

614
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,760
companion may say

615
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,700
were you going to say something else so

616
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,580
your friend your partner

617
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,260
someone that you're talking to

618
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,020
may say

619
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,840
were you going to say something else and

620
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,400
we may reply yeah I was so busy with

621
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,480
other thoughts I can't remember what it

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,279
was

623
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,740
that's because you let the electricity

624
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,419
was harboring the information inside

625
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,419
your brain was holding on to that

626
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,360
information inside your brain but you

627
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,700
couldn't grab it out of there

628
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,100
we're not having a memory lapse it's

629
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,140
information that slipped by inside our

630
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,200
brain's electrical grid that we didn't

631
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,360
access it's not a memory problem it's

632
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,760
not like oh God I got a bad memory right

633
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,760
now I don't know what I was thinking

634
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,320
Maria Lourdes says it happens to me all

635
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,320
the time

636
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,059
it's actually not a memory lapse signs

637
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,559
of research doesn't know that you're

638
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,320
losing your memory

639
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,360
no it's not a memory lapse right there

640
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,460
in that situation there's tiny nuances

641
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,860
and detailed information Susan Denise

642
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,840
says I need every protocol on the book

643
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,480
good grief bless you Anthony thank you

644
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,940
for being here

645
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,320
damage neurons can change thoughts

646
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,679
altering how someone perceives

647
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,679
information

648
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,779
damaged neurons

649
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,299
can change our thoughts we put our

650
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,700
perception can go off because of damaged

651
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,740
neurons Emma says I have been battling

652
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,539
severe depression for over a decade now

653
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,880
this knowledge is everything thank you

654
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,700
for being here

655
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,340
a monitor here Linda Larkin said thank

656
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,960
you for these mind-blowing books so glad

657
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,240
you guys are here I can't wait for you

658
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,760
guys hold these books in your hands

659
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,039
you'll feel it when you have them in

660
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,039
your hands it's really just incredible

661
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,840
that's because damaged neurons mean

662
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,820
altered disorganized and poorly

663
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,159
reorganized electricity so here it goes

664
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,600
if you have an injured neuron you guys a

665
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,539
damaged neuron the electricity

666
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,580
traveling through that neuron is going

667
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,580
to have scrambled information

668
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,580
scatterbrains

669
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,059
as electricity travels through synapsis

670
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,100
and heads to another group of neurons

671
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,679
information in that electricity could

672
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,720
become disorganized before it enters the

673
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,700
new group of neurons so as you've got

674
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,980
one group of neurons and electricity

675
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,919
goes into it it's going to go into a

676
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,380
whole bunch of of saturated contaminated

677
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,360
or injured neurons when that electricity

678
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,400
goes into that batch of saturated

679
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,740
contaminated neurons

680
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,120
it's going to get scrambled up so now

681
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,279
our thoughts

682
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,320
and our emotions everything and when

683
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,000
that electricity leaves that batch of

684
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,039
neurons and heads to another batch of

685
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,020
neurons it's got different information

686
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,860
in it meaning it's scrambled up it's

687
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,919
like

688
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,919
the brain fog brain fog starts to happen

689
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,220
won't the previous books address this

690
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,799
too all the medical medium books

691
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,900
are incredible books this is all new

692
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,580
information with even more information

693
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,440
on the brain packed with brand new

694
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,260
information

695
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,159
so that's why all the books are

696
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,279
important

697
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,460
often people say you know can I just get

698
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,080
one book you can look each medical

699
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,080
meeting book has been life-changing and

700
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,200
saved countless lives out there but it's

701
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,480
additional tools and protocols and I'm

702
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,520
only one human being one little human

703
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,840
being that

704
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,940
you know

705
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,799
can only put the books these books would

706
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:55,140
take other I mean this these books

707
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,240
if someone wanted to write medical books

708
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,860
with this much information say using

709
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,039
whatever was out there in the world of

710
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,679
medicine now it took them five years and

711
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:08,039
they would have a team of people citing

712
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,720
every study and what and I think it

713
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:12,179
would take them five ten years to to

714
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,860
finish a book like this

715
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,200
it's different in this situation getting

716
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,539
the information

717
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,860
both these books you know forget oh

718
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,860
these books take them 20 years

719
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,940
but that would be useless information

720
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,100
thank you

721
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,299
unlike these books

722
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,299
okay so let's go

723
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,440
so it's not just brain tissue that

724
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,000
Harbors thoughts and controls how we

725
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,520
feel and how we physically function

726
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,140
electricity itself also has the power

727
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,539
over our thoughts and physical control

728
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,940
but the electricity itself in our brain

729
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,799
has the power

730
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,600
that's what's incredible

731
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,419
it's part of how we can heal because the

732
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,659
electricity has its own power in our

733
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,659
brain

734
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,080
one job of neurons is to eventually pass

735
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,399
along information to the brain's

736
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,980
billions of glial cells where

737
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,240
information stays stored cataloged and

738
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,460
organized

739
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,679
the glial cells are clogged contaminated

740
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,600
saturated distorted or even mutated from

741
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,820
poisons and toxins a disconnected

742
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,440
breakdown can occur between your neuron

743
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,020
system and the glial cell system so when

744
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,940
your neurons are all messed up

745
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,039
that's one thing electricity going

746
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,740
through them with misinformation or

747
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,480
sorry scrambled up information then if

748
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,039
they get stored in their glial cells and

749
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,779
your glial cells are contaminated so

750
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,700
many people have Metals in their glial

751

can heal right

877
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,380
some of these strategies are how we

878
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,380
think right

879
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,960
I have been doing your protocols for the

880
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,960
last four years and my husband has only

881
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,599
jumped on board this week yeah you are

882
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,640
getting your information out amazing

883
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,640
tell them I said hi please

884
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,760
it's often about how we trick our

885
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,560
thoughts and perceptions trying to

886
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,880
better our lives with how we think right

887
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,560
when we're trying to master our mind

888
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,900
some of these strategies are positive

889
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,880
see I'm being positive I'm not being

890
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,500
sarcastic right there

891
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,000
I know everybody's trying to hack their

892
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,440
brains with some kind of technique and

893
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,839
stuff and I'm being positive I'm not

894
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,460
being negative about it it's often about

895
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,480
how we trick our thoughts you know

896
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,640
everybody's trying to trick their

897
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,680
thoughts trick them trick them out of

898
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,060
something right and perceptions trying

899
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,740
to better our lives with how we think

900
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,839
some of these strategies are positive

901
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,180
and can be very helpful temporarily

902
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:42,060
because I don't mind trying to manage I

903
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,160
want people to be able to manage

904
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,079
if you're doing stitches and patching up

905
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,820
some emotional physical conditions in

906
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,380
some situations you have to manage it

907
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,880
then you've got to use these hacks they

908
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,920
still don't get to the root of why we're

909
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,900
struggling I want to get to the root of

910
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,780
why I wish why we're struggling and I

911
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,940
said to SOC I want to get to the root I

912
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,980
need to know why everybody's suffering

913
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,500
and the spiritual bachelor's like yes

914
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,060
that's why we're here doing this and

915
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,359
it's in here

916
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,760
it's not about managing and hacks

917
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,320
Michelle oh I've heard doctors say they

918
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
already knew medical medium information

919
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,339
laugh out loud really because you've

920
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,900
been around for a long time in the

921
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,859
health field I know a lot of other

922
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,720
people that have too and nothing existed

923
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:26,820
literally medical media book one when it

924
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,640
came out

925
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,460
all original unique

926
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,280
and brand new and everybody knew it and

927
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,980
there wasn't one paper one study one

928
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,800
doctor that knew any of it and this is

929
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,140
eight years ago

930
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,880
and millions see the little gold emblem

931
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,099
there millions of these copies got

932
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,119
around the world and in every doctor's

933
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,119
office and everything else

934
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,380

blood draw information you guys

00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,180
I mean it was just absolutely incredible

944
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,119
to blood draw information

945
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,619
and I go into real epic detail about

946
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,619
blood draw in the books

947
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,880
with these thought techniques we may

948
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,980
over compensate to the point that we

949
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,420
exhaust ourselves we try so hard to

950
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,280
control our thought patterns have you

951
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,079
ever tried that hard to keep positive

952
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,599
thoughts to create new references to

953
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,460
focus on confidence Builders positive

954
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,380
thinking right awareness it's all good

955
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,359
stuff new thoughts about how we feel

956
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,579
about our lives and we find that we're

957
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,560
still struggling with our problems why

958
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:58,200
why are we still struggling with their

959
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,240
problems when we tried so hard to

960
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,099
actually control our thought patterns

961
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,500
keep positive thoughts create new

962
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,720
references focus on confidence building

963
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,820
positive thinking awareness and all

964
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,520
that's good but why

965
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,960
why are we still struggling when we're

966
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,720
doing all that

967
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,599
because no one has shown us the root of

968
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,640
the problem and how to fix it for real

969
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,980
physical issues in our brains and

970
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,140
nervous systems all our energy goes into

971
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,180
trying to correct and battle our minds

972
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,859
by doing everything we can to make

973
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,780
ourselves better people spiritually

974
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:33,599
emotionally mentally but we don't know

975
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,460
what's wrong with ourselves

976
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,720
