somewhere else she heard it from a

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,680
professional she heard it from an

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
article she heard it from a functional

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
doctor she heard it from a chinese

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,039
medicine doctor she heard it from a

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
registered dietitian she heard it from a

162
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,400
naturopathic doctor

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,000
she heard it from a western naturopathic

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,199
doctor whatever and what she heard

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,639
was a health professional being exposed

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,000
as a fraud because celery juice

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,360
exposes and angers the frauds

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,400
that's all it is

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,199
so whoever told that cashier

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
not to drink the celery juice and was a

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,479
professional in any kind of arena of

172
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,120
health doesn't care about the person

173
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,120
healing doesn't care which means they're

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
not in it for the patient to win it

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,880
angela gibbons my psoriasis is so much

176
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
better and healing a lot nothing else

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,479
moved the needle no matter how much

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,160
money i spent with a variety of

179
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,280
practitioners over the last six years

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,880
exactly

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
and if there's a practitioner that

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,080
denies it or denies someone's story last

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
five years unbelievable denies that

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,800
story denies what it can do and then

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
turns around after hearing that story

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,280
and says to another patient don't you

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,039
drink celery juice then they are a fraud

188
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
because what it is is they're not in it

189
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039

all those fraudulent products and trends

237
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,000

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,399
the boards and and you know board

exposes their game

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,959
celery juice is like this light

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
light

248
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,800
it's like a light

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
in a ocean of darkness

250
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
and

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,440
that's what it is

252
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,120
and the farmers aren't making money off

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
of it

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,560
the media won't cover this but it's the

255
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,880
largest crop in the world

256
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
in the fruit vegetable herb and spice

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,839

cover it

260
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,519

and no one's talking about it besides

294
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,920
talking about it and talking it

295
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640

it down

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,519

keeping it going

300
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000

and they drink it in the closet

330
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,480

seller juice is the guilty pleasure i

346
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
just saw that

347
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
people are at different levels of

348
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
sickness always remember this some

349
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
people they just need a glass of celery

350
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,320
juice and boom they change in one night

351
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,760
some people they need to have it

352
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
increased and they need to be doing

353
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
other tools but the celery juice is a

354
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,760
critical part of moving the needle and

355
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,120
getting people to where they need to go

356
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,279
so it's it's a major major tool

357
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
it's one of those most powerful healing

358
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,839
foods of our time

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
and it's an herb

360
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
it's an herb i gotta say that over and

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
over again because everybody still

362
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,240
thinks it's a vegetable a veggie

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
sue is celery force the same as drinking

364
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
celery no it's not there's no celery in

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
southern forest

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,240
celery force is amazing i just took some

367
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,360
so i'm going to try to slow the speed of

368
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,279
of i might a little talk so fast

369
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
i just throw a bunch of celery force and

370
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,000
send it down and

371
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,079
something just happens

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,800
but yeah it's not the same thing

373
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,079
you need your celery juice you do

374
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
so

375
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,959

417
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,480
stop

418
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,279

it on youtube only

422
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,040

doing youtube lives and only that

425
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,079

426
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,839
option for me to go live so when they

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,680
have that option i'll probably probably

428
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
be on there only for something on

429
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
youtube

tick tock too i might not be on there

431
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,070
live in the future either because they

432
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,360
don't notify anybody

433

just so you guys know

437
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
it's a medical device

438
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,079
why would i

439
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,639
back

440
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,950
and support

441
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,320
a juicer

[Applause]

443
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
because it's a medical device that can

444
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,720
save you money

445
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,519
mj taurus doctors say that it's not

446
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,000
healthy to drink it daily oh really

447
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
where would they get such a uh piece of

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
information that would

449
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
science and research come up with that

450
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,920
no they don't do anything on celery so

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
doctors say that it's not healthy to

452
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,720
drink it daily because celery contains

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,160
oxalates

454
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,399
and these interfere with calcium

455
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,880
absorption okay

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,959
but it but doctors are okay with green

457
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,039
tea daily caffeine right

458
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
age you give you sun spots burn out your

459
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,360
adrenals

460
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,839
just burn you out coffee's okay daily

461
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,079
yeah chocolate's okay daily

462
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,439
those are okay daily by doctors that's

463
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,919
right because the caffeine industry

464
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,360
guess what is part of pharma

465
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,880
there's caffeine almost in every single

466
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,319
pharmaceutical even the ones they say

467
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
there isn't

468
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,439
so caffeine's in every single

469
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
pharmaceutical

470
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,840
it's a psychoactive drug but that's okay

471
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,360
to do daily

472
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,440
sure let's get our kids addicted to

473
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,880
caffeine too so they're drinking coffee

474
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
nice and early

475
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,679
then they're just addicted to caffeine

476
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,440
and espressos and everything else

477
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,919
burning out their adrenals

478
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,520
and oxalates that's a funny one because

479
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,360
oxalates are in every single fruit and

480
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,039
vegetable urban spice so don't eat a

481
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,080
fruit and vegetable again

482
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,320
uh

483
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,559
don't oxalates are in grass grass-fed

484
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,320
beef

485
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,640
cattle that's eating grass are ingesting

486
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,240
and consuming oxalates from the grass

487
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,440
their meat is filled with oxalates but

488
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,799
don't eat meat so you know what i guess

489
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
you just don't eat

490
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,360
don't eat meat

491
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,440
don't eat uh

492
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
we're going to eat turkey

493
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,280
just be on turkey

494
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
turkey has a little less oxalates in it

495
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
than anything else why don't you just be

496
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
on turkey

497
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,160
don't eat anything no fruit no vegetable

498
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,080
don't do celery don't do anything just

499
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
eat turkey

500
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,520
and then you can't poo

501
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,120
and then you'll get a hernia and then

502
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
you'll be getting a surgery and then you

503
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,840
know what they'll have you on insurer or

504
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
something in the hospital how about that

505
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
it's a bad theory the oxalate theory

506
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
isn't even real it's a bad theory

507
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,320
because nobody knows why anybody's sick

508
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
i remember

509
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,960
the oxalate theory came out of the the

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,720
the whole

511
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,280
like bloom of chronic illness where

512
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,400
nobody knew was that why anybody is sick

513
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,960
in the 1970s and 1980s nobody knew why

514
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
anybody was sick 1990s people suffering

515
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,400
and laying in bed nobody knew why

516
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
anybody has anything nobody knows why

517
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,559
people have ms nobody knows anything

518
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,880
oxalates was a theory along with other

519
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,240
things like that

520
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,320
you know i mean really that's what it is

521
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,880
meanwhile heavy metals and pathogens are

522
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,720
why people get sick viruses bacteria

523
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
toxic heavy metals

524
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,559
you know that's why we get sick and then

525
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
we get intoxicated from perfumes and

526
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
colognes and air fresheners and scented

527
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
candles and then we get intoxicated by

528
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,200
caffeine so doctors will support

529
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,440

563
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,039
because i didn't it's not because of the

564
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,320
celery juice i drink

565
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,320
if i die

566
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,240
it's not because of

567
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,720
you know all the fruits and vegetables

568
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,120
and wild foods i've eaten

569
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,600
if i die it's because yeah i did it to

570
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,559
myself i burned myself to the ground to

571
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,559
the ground

572
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,880
right

573
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,600
because i want to look out for people

574
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,000
you know i see the spirit of compassion

575
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,840
fruit of compassion tells me many times

576
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,200
like look

577
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
you're gonna have to you're gonna have

578
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,720
to slow down

579
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,720
you can't do 21-hour days all the time

580
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
i'm writing a new book right now it's

581
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,120
the best book ever

582
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,960
they're all best books ever but

583
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,880
this book

584
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,559
is so big

585
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,039
i'm worried about people being able to

586
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
hold it

587
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,000
it's gonna blow people's doors off

588
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,159
[Music]

589
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,159
but i gotta say i'm paying the price

590
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,400
cheese says i'm so excited i am finally

591
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,640
salt free yo

592
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
i never thought i could do it and i owe

593
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,960
it to you mmm

594
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
what's your heart

595
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,159
celery juice let's talk about celery

596
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,679
just for a little bit i'm i think i'm

597
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
just going off in different directions

598
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,919
on you guys and i want to keep it spot

599
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,559
on succinct whatever we want to call it

600
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,039
pertinent information

601
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,440
okay 16 ounces on an empty stomach right

602
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,120
you guys know the rules

603
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
so you can do less if you're sensitive

604
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,760
no problem do 8 ounces 4 ounces 6 ounces

605
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,080
try to work up to 32 ounces ideal if you

606
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,360
have to do 64 ounces or 50 ounces so

607
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,559
somebody left a

608
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,159
somebody left to come and i think on

609
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,919
youtube saying they did 50 ounces and

610
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
i'm like wow they did 50 ounces for a

611
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,760
long time if you're sensitive start out

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,919
slow though start out low whatever works

613
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,520
strain it don't add anything in it

614
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,960
but i love that right

615
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,960
lorraine it's unbelievable so you're in

616
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,400

617
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,720
instead it's so sad when you hear that

623
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,720
carolyn says my husband had kidney

624
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,520
stones and he was he told me to watch

625
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,520
how many oxalates i eat and i put in his

626
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
food

627
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,960
you know what causes kidney stones

628
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
leaching calcium right calcium that's

629
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
leeched

630
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,280
how does calcium get leech let's go into

631
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,280
it right now

632
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,880
okay

633
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,080
so got a little friend here all right

634
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
and

635
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,279
let me give you guys a little run down

636
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
real quick

637
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,440
here's how

638
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,880
your skull shrinks

639
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,480
it shrinks from the inside out

640
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,039
letting you know

641
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,240
your skull shrinks and weakens from the

642
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,559
inside out

643
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,640
because of vinegar

644
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,440
caffeine

645
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,520
and too much fat

646
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,279
when you're 60 years old then you fall

647
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,600
on a sidewalk you crack your head open

648
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
when you're 20 years old your skull is

649
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,000
thick enough to not crack it open so

650
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,159
easily you will sustain some pretty good

651
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,440
confusions and blows but not have this

652
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,960
fracture across half your skull

653
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
unless it's a hit that just can't be

654
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
avoided it's a hit that's just so hard

655
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,960
then it'll crack anybody's call

656
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,440
the point is is our skulls

657
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,640
get diminished they get eaten away from

658
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,720
the inside out from caffeine

659
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,600
and vinegar and guess where the calcium

660
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,880
goes

661
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,360
in your kidneys and builds a stone

662
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,720
not from some phantom oxalate made-up

663
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,960
story that there's no science and

664
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,200
research behind

665
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,799
the high fat diets

666
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,159
are so acidic

667
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,480
fatty acid how should i say that

668
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,720
fatty acids

669
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,720
fatty acids

670
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
fat is acid

671
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
all the fat is acid your butter straight

672
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,919
acid

673
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,679
your dairy products your straight acid

674
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,679
your butter straight acid your eggs are

675
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,159
straight acid they're not alkalizing on

676
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,320
any level they're all acid fat fat fat

677
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,400
is acid and then you lose your bones and

678
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,640
then you add more acid to it you guys

679
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,279
pump the kombucha tea because it's being

680
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
pumped by money 24 7. kombucha tea

681
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,960
people hate the celery juice thing

682
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
because it people say well you know what

683
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,240
i'm going to spend my money on celery

684
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,840
juice i'm not going to spend it on

685
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,000
buying more expensive kombucha tea

686
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,919
celery juice exposes those frauds like i

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,360
said before

688
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,919
kombucha tea

689
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,600
literally dissolves your bones

690
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,200
vinegar dissolves your bones

691
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
okay

692
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
fat dissolves your bones and then that

693
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,840
calcium ends up in your kidneys and in

694
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,279
your gallbladder that's

695
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,279
a fact jack entirely different than what

696
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,200
people think they think they're wrong

697
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,520
misinformation out there and it's really

698
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
sad

699
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,679
if i had a kidney problem on any level

700
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
or kidney stones if i had anything like

701
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,919
that you know what i'd be doing if i was

702
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,080
an animal protein eater gone gone no

703
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,760
animal protein for me

704
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
and i'm not even against animal protein

705
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,640
eating for people

706
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,600
i'm pro-animal protein if that's what

707
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,200
your heart desires and i'm

708
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,919
pro-plant-based if you guys want to be

709
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
eating lettuce all day i completely i'm

710
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,080
on your side

711
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,919
but i want you guys to do it right

712
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,039
so that you can heal

713
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,760
but if i had a kidney problem man that

714
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,440
that animal protein would be gone boom

715
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,120
you think i mean i would i would get rid

716
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,159
of that stuff so fast it wouldn't even

717
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,720
be funny

718
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,720
be gone

719
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,799
so if i had a kidney problem or kidney

720
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,360
stones those meat patties

721
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,679
those meat patties toss them out

722
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,720
chicken chicken cutlets those chicken

723
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,640
breasts grilled gone if i had a kidney

724
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,880
problem that's what you that's what

725
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,400
you're going to have tell your husband

726
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
any kind of kidney issues tell your

727
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,679
husband it ain't the oxalates you got to

728
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,039
worry about you keep on eating that

729
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,840
chicken he's going to wind up with

730
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,320
another another kidney problem

731
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,440
even salmon

732
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,440
i'm not against animal proteins

733
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,559
i'm just telling you how it works

734
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,279
okay so let's talk about uh celery juice

735
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,399
i want to strain it you guys got to

736
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
strain it

737
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,320
you have to

738
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,559
now i just juiced this right the mm-900

739
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,039
hds

740
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,240
this is dry this pulp

741
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,679
this pulp is dry

742
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,039
it's dry

743
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
saving money

744
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,000
every celery stick that goes in

745
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
saves you money

746
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,480
you buy half the celery of what you used

747
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,919
to buy at least for me

748
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,760
that's what it is i used to have to go

749

753
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,520
this juicer has paid for itself dozens

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,679
of times at this point i can't count it

755
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760

that's the whole thing

779
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,000
and i'd rather have this medical device

780
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,159
than be hooked up to tubes

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,559
i'd rather have this medical device be

782
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,640
all hooked up to to oxygen because of

783
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,640
oxygen going up my nostrils

784
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
that omega juicer

785
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,320

it's gonna pay for itself over and over

792
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
again i've never seen a juicer out of

793
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,720
all the juicers out there i've never

794
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,720
seen a juicer you guys pay for itself

795
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,640
and pay for itself and pay for itself

796
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,399
it's ridiculous it's almost stupid at

797
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
this point it's stupid

798
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,320
literally it's stupid it you know what i

799
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
counted like it paid for itself by its

800
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,279
10th time one time because i was keeping

801
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,120
track of all the numbers in the in the

802
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,279
usage and how much celery juice and all

803
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,279
that and how much i buy and it paid for

804
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,200
itself like for its 10th time and i said

805
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,640
at this point it's just stupid

806
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,559
that's how ridiculous that's how

807
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,120
incredible it is it just it got it got

808
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,550
dumb got stupid

809
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,760
what i love about the mm-900 hds

810
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,360
[Music]

811
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,440
you don't see metal gears rubbing

812
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,120
against each other

813
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,880
you don't see metal gears running

814
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,640
rubbing against each other

815
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,880
like someone tried to throw that at me

816
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,039
oh yeah this juicer company over here is

817
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,279
the best they even talk about how

818
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,520
they're better than the omega oh really

819
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,159
because i see metal gears in there so

820
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,480
unless i want a juice filled with tiny

821
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,520
bits of metal nobody sees

822
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,520
unless i want that

823
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,039
i think i took too much celery force

824
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,120
natalie question is it okay to juice the

825
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,360
celery leaves yeah it's okay

826
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,039
it's okay they don't come with a lot

827
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,399
normally but if you get some wild celery

828
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,919
like the wild crazy stuff like you know

829
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,240
a friend of mine grew a bunch of celery

830
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,480
and and i went to check it out and and

831
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
it was just only leaves right it was

832
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,279
only leaves i was like dude

833
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
you need to be careful on how much you

834
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,480
juice of that right off the running

835
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,960
that's bitter it's it's astringent

836
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,000
it's going to knock your socks off just

837
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,679
just do

838
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,919
some of that

839
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,240
you know at a time because that's

840
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,240
nothing but leaves it was only leaves

841
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,080
there wasn't even any stalks it was just

842
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
a whole bush of leaves

843
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,000
and he's like cutting the leaves and i'm

844
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,640
like oh dude you gotta like you gotta

845
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
chill on that

846
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
but yeah of course you do leaves when

847
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,039
you're doing stalks and you do some

848
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,039
leaves with it yeah of course you can

849
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,679
is there a special juice

850
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,880
it's look it's it's

851
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,960
the thing is with celery juice is

852
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,440
keep in mind that

853
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,840
it works it work its ability to work is

854
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,480
in it's in the fact that it's in single

855
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,399
herbal extraction

856
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,200
you know what you guys hear me out on

857
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,360

proof you can tell me i'm wrong tell me

862
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,159

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,760
you can give me the comments to say

865
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,360
you're wrong aw you're wrong and it's

866
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,120
okay if you tell me that

867
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,960
human nature

868
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,519
doesn't like it simple

869
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,159
we think we like things simple right

870
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,880
but we really don't like we need to

871
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,320
think that a pharmaceutical is a

872
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
scientific

873
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,880
you know

874
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,480
invention of all these things in there

875
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,880
we need to think that this herbal

876
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,360
formula has 20 herbs in it that was

877
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,679
synergistically proprietary put together

878
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,399
for some we we think that

879
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,480
it's always got to be complicated

880
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,880
to heal

881
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,880
complicated

882
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,200
right that's human nature no it's got to

883
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,440
become it can't be just celery juice

884
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,519
that's too ridiculous it's too simple it

885
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,600
can't be celery juice

886
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,440
it's got to be complicated right right

887
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,840
because everybody everybody it's got to

888
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,880
be complicated always has to be no it's

889
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,360
got to be

890
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,440
scientifically tested and proven and 20

891
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,559
million things in there and and then

892
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,320
maybe oh that must be some mysterious

893
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,720
that must be the way the synergistic way

894
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,519
that was systematically all these things

895
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,679
put in there that works not just one

896
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,799
thing

897
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,799
and that's a grave mistake we make

898
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:30,159
simplicity is in

899
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,039
the power is in the simplicity the power

900
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,360
is in the simplicity

901
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,360
yep

902
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,919
jefferson says with plastic gears then

903
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,679
you get plastic in your juice

904
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,000
okay let's talk about that a little bit

905
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,000
right

906
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,480
plastic

907
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,559
is in every single thing you touch it

908
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,159
every day you touch your credit card you

909
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,600
just rub plastic and that's a bad

910
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,440
plastic on that

911
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,760
any kind of saran wrap any kind of

912
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,760
whatever whatever you know plastic wraps

913
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,159
any kind of plastics plastic this

914
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,200
plastic cups plastic everything right

915
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,760
plastic

916
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
okay there's plastic in petrofuel

917
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,440
there's plastic and gasoline you breathe

918
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,280
in plastic every day when you take a

919
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,040
walk on the street and a car goes by

920
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,399
there's plastic in everything and

921
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,599
anything

922
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,960
and plastic isn't the scary toxin

923
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,000
you know what is you know what the scary

924
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,200
attack toxin is it's metal

925
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,079
run from it for your life with your life

926
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,359
you don't want metal

927
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,839
metal does a whole bunch of bad stuff

928
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,520
okay and this isn't cheap plastic this

929
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,280
is bpa free plastic in here

930
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,879
but the point is is that even if a bpa

931
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
free plastic

932
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,800
right

933
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,480
even if some residue of plastic somehow

934
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,480
got into your body it comes out easy

935
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
because this not only takes out plastic

936
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
outside of your body but it takes out

937
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
plastic from every other thing inside

938
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
your body all plastic that's been in

939
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,000
your body this removes it this removes

940
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,480
celery just removes plastic you can't

941
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,240
get enough plastic in fast enough while

942
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,920
celery juice is pulling it out that's a

943
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,960
whole other thing too about why it's so

944
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
powerful and with detoxifying people

945
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,040
but metal

946
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,800
metals a

947
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,520
you want to play with metal gears

948
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,160
rubbing against each other uh-huh

949
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,119
you want more adhd you want more brain

950
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,280
fog you want more anxiety

951
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,119
keep on playing with metal

952
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,000
that's half of why everybody's sick is

953
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,400
because of metal copper aluminum mercury

954
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,400
cadmium lead nickel steel

955
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,960
steel

956
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,760
anyway guys just just a reminder like i

957
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,880
said this is 20 off

958
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,960
omegajuicers.com is the sale it's only

959
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,240
on this juicer it's only running for a

960
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,520
couple of days

961
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,280
just letting you know

962
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,119
saves you a lot of money and it saves

963
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,680
you a lot of money when you're juicing

964
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,599
because it's literally doing the dry

965
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,240
pulp the dry pulp okay there's no juice

966
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,320
down in here the pulp all the pulp

967
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,560
little drops come right off there's

968
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,040
nothing moist in here

969
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,640
it's not moist it's dry

970
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,119
i've never seen that with any other

971
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
juicer

972
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,560
so that's really cool

973
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,040
so

974
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,599
i just want to say one thing back to one

975
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,359
little topic right i support the animal

976
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,320
protein crowd is support the plant-based

977
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,560
crowd

978
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
both crowds right both crowds know they

979
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,000
get sick

980
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,000
both crowds do things wrong

981
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,160
both crowds are misled non-stop out

982
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,160
there

983
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,680
and

984
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,839
i'm not here to judge someone

985
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,320
because they're eating a piece of meat

986
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,760
and i'm not here to judge someone

987
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,839
because they think they're the smartest

988
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,839
plant-based person there is because they

989
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,640
watched all the plant-based

990
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,800
documentaries they talk to some

991
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,640
plant-based doctors

992
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,240
they think they got it all down and

993
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,240
they're indestructible

994
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,680
and i'm not judging them either

995
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,599
and then they think they're smart as

996
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,359
anything

997
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,040
and i'm not judging the keto person who

998
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,480
thinks they got it all down and they all

999
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,640
know what's going on and they think

1000
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,280
they're smart and all the keto doctors

1001
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
talking that

1002
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
you know which brings me to and i'm not

1003
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,200
judging anybody

1004
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,800
but everybody gets sick

1005
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,320
i've seen it over and over again you can

1006
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
act like you got it down i think you got

1007
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,839
it down and then you get sick and you go

1008
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,520
down

1009
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,000
and then you find out

1010
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,000
that that keto or that paleo diet or

1011
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,720
that plant-based diet something was

1012
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,160
wrong you don't know what it is

1013
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,520
hell you don't even know why you're sick

1014
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
you don't even know you got pathogens

1015
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
and

1016
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,760
viruses and bacteria and you don't know

1017
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,839
you've got metals you don't go no you

1018
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,119
don't know nothing

1019
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,640
because the plant-based crowd doesn't

1020
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,920
know why anybody's sick and the animal

1021
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,920
protein crowd doesn't know why anybody's

1022
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,000
sick everybody's in the dentist chairs

1023
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
all the same getting their teeth drilled

1024
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,200
they're all doing apple cider vinegar

1025
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,119
the plant-based crowds do an apple cider

1026
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,440
vinegar the animal protein crowds do an

1027
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,760
apple cider vinegar get this the

1028
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,640
plant-based crowd they're doing caffeine

1029
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,240
the animal-based crowds doing caffeine

1030
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
the plant-based crowd are doing fat

1031
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,880
fat robot

1032
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,359

myself to death that robot

1040
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,800
fat robot

1041
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,920
there's a protein robot

1042
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,920
is the protein robot

1043
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
there's a fat robot

1044
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,200
and there's the chocolate robot too

1045
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,200
anyway

1046
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,320
which is fat

1047
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
look

1048
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,640
it's viruses bacteria toxic heavy metals

1049
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,200
toxins the high fat diet

1050
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,359
these are the things

1051
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,640
that are taking out

1052
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,720
the animal protein people in the

1053
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,280
plant-based people but they're both

1054
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,119
doing the bad stuff guess what

1055
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,480
guess what

1056
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,000
the animal protein people are doing

1057
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,599
nutritional yeast every day and the

1058
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,760
plant-based people are doing nutritional

1059
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,359
yeast every day the animal protein

1060
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,839
people are taking the nuts in the seeds

1061
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,680
and the oils and the avocado and the ana

1062
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,440
and the plant prostate protein people

1063
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
are taking the nut seeds avocado in the

1064
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,560
oils

1065
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,520
they're both fattening themselves to

1066
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,760
death

1067
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,440
vinegaring themselves to death

1068
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
they're both kombucha teeing themselves

1069
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
to death

1070
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,400
that's right fermented foods they're

1071
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,640
both they're both they're just they're

1072
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,440
just pickling themselves and they're

1073
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,480
both over salting themselves to death

1074
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,640
our body needs a certain amount of salt

1075
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,720
when it's in the right form

1076
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,240
when it's in the right form

1077
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,480
the animal protein and plant-based

1078
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,720
people just throw salt in everything

1079
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,400
salt salt salt here salt here let me

1080
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,640
drink salt salt they salt themselves to

1081
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
death

1082
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,720
kimwood says i have a food sensitivity

1083
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,720
to celery juice what do i do

1084
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,720
uh first of all you have to be your own

1085
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,599
detective so let me help you be your own

1086
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,599
detective

1087
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,720
celery juice

1088
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,920
swells up your throat you can't

1089
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,240
swallow and breathe

1090
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,319
does celery juice make you break out

1091
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,560
with a big ration hives right away once

1092
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,119
you just take a sip of it

1093
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,960
the celery juice make you get oh son you

1094
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,359
got a tight chest and you can't and you

1095
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,119
got all since something happens and you

1096
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,800
all these things break out on your head

1097
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,920
and you're just all all just tears

1098
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
running down your eyes because you're

1099
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,160
having some kind of reaction

1100
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,240
because if that's happening don't drink

1101
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,240
it

1102
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,680
or

1103
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,599
is it a bs test

1104
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
fabricated by the food sensitivity

1105
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,880
people

1106
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,880
when they tell you you're allergic to

1107
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
this so this to this i got a phone call

if you're eating a celery stick and your

1193
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,119
throat closes up don't eat it if you're

1194
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,480
eating a

1195
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,480
piece of lettuce and your throat's

1196
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,880
closing up don't eat it

1197
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000

because then don't eat it tests are

1200
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,520
faulty because they don't even know why

1201
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,280
anybody's sick

1202
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,520

1203
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,640
sensitivity tests food sensitivity tests

1204
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,040
they don't even know why anybody has

1205
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,440
fibro hashimoto's

1206
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,079
can i just ask you guys something

1207
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,599
does it make sense to you

1208
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,280
when all these years nobody knows why

1209
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,680
anybody's sick with chronic illness they

1210
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,800
just call it autoimmune now

1211
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,240
and but yet they have all the answers

1212
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,920
because i'm confused i'm scratching my

1213
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
head a little bit on that one

1214
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,920
they have all the answers but they don't

1215
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,920
know why anybody's sick

1216
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,480
yeah

1217
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,119
see

1218
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,640
tests are faulty

1219
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,319
yeah

1220
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,560
see innard uh brutal says i have heard

1221
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,480
that you can develop an intolerance to

1222
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,240
something you consume a lot

1223
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,599
of over time surely not celery juice

1224
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,240
i know a lot of alcoholics

1225
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,440
they could just drink and drink and

1226
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,240
drink and drink

1227
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,160
and then they don't stop drinking

1228
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,079
well i don't know they don't build any

1229
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,240
kind of problems to it they'll drink

1230
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,079
until they die down the road they'll

1231
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,440
drink and they'll drink and they'll

1232
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,920
drink and they'll drink i'm gonna get a

1233
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,359
glass of wine you guys don't mind

1234
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,359
i would love to just drink

1235
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,040
i don't know they're building an

1236
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,079
intolerance to it getting myself some

1237
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,079
some white wine right now

1238
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,800
so

1239
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,520
i'm gonna have a glass of white white

1240
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,240
wine

1241
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,680
right when we get done with this live

1242
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,280
i'm gonna have

1243
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,359
white wine

1244
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
five seconds after i finished my celery

1245
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,240
juice

1246
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,520
that's a terrible idea by the way

1247
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,400
what happens is what people don't

1248
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,520
realize is that

1249
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,240
you can eat a healing food

1250
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,160
for a long time

1251
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,119
long time

1252
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,240
there's no intolerance you get from it

1253
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,560
right

1254
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,160
i i don't know i've been drinking celery

1255
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,680
juice since i was a kid every single day

1256
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,280
i don't know what intolerance you're

1257
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,880
talking about

1258
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,319
but i do know this

1259
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,280
okay

1260
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,000
that

1261
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,480
if someone has

1262
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,400
some type of reaction and they think

1263
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
it's because

1264
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,400
of a food healing food they're using

1265
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,000
that healing food could be cleaning out

1266
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,280
yeast mold unproductive fungus viruses

1267
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,839
bacteria

1268
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,560
byproduct metals

1269
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,520
the cleansing process gets mistaken

1270
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:50,160
sometimes is intolerance

1271
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,160
but you know and and that gets mistaken

1272
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,000
when someone eats eggs they feed all

1273
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,880
their bugs

1274
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,800
they're gonna feel okay

1275
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,119
they're gonna feel okay you know i ate

1276
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,280
some eggs i feel good i made myself a

1277
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,720
nice egg dish

1278
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,319
a friend of mine tells me that they see

1279
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,319
it on youtube all the time all the

1280
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,599
youtube influencers are like making

1281
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,760
their food

1282
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,319
they toss their little salad of greens

1283
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,800
with oil and vinegar with olive oil they

1284
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,400
get their little soft-boiled eggs

1285
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,240
and they put their soft-boiled eggs on

1286
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,319
their salad

1287
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,200
right goes down easy

1288
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,680
but

1289
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,440
the minute you get buggy and get buggier

1290
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,200
those eggs will feed the bugs and feed

1291
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,359
them and feed them and feed them to the

1292
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,720
point where whether to the point where

1293
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,599
every time you eat an egg you'll feel

1294
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,359
fine or eventually you'll just get so

1295
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,839
sick but not know the egg is feeding the

1296
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,839
bugs

1297
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,960
lorraine says i'm getting really

1298
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,040
intolerant to bs but that's about it

1299
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,280
mary fox says to think i limit it

1300
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,359
limited my fruit potatoes and all but

1301
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,520
