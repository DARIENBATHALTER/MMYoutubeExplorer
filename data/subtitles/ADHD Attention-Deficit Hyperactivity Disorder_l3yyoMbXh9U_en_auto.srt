1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
HD incredible comprehensive information

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,080
all through the brain saver books I just

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,700
want to read a little to you real quick

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:15,480
here's what ADHD isn't genetic it's not

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,640
genetic and it's not gut related neither

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,740
of those popular explanations addresses

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,080
the true underlying causes of ADHD so in

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,060
here I talk about how the midline canal

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,760
right there so there it is the midline

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,500
canal you guys if you take a look

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,520
right here

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,000
this section here gets filled up with

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,579
particles of toxic heavy metals they

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,940
actually fill into the midline canal

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,059
right here then as you get older the

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,059
brain pushes together

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:55,140
and seals up the midline canal right

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,020
there then the metals get trapped in

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,239
that Canal making it harder for them to

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,520
be removed unless you have the right

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,119
things to use the right information the

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,280
right protocols so ADHD is a compilation

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,840
of mercury and aluminum so I'm going to

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,939
go into the book a little bit right here

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,659
so I'm reading out a brain saver I'm

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,600
excited about this actually so what

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,259
really causes ADHD is Mercury and

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,320
aluminum settling in the brain's

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,420
cerebral midline Canal which divides the

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,040
brain's left hemisphere and right

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,140
hemisphere

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
along with some additional metal so

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,939
here's the other part that's interesting

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,579
so ADHD isn't just the midline canal and

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,240
the metals settling into there it's also

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,579
metal sprinkled about throughout the

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,920
brain in different areas so it's kind of

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,360
like that Christmas light Christmas tree

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,700
effect going throughout the brain Plus

40
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,979
midline Canal with the metals

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,000
and that's important to know it's the

42
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,659
same causes autism as well same exact

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,119
cause the difference though is just like

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,759
anybody's differences with ADHD or

45
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,160
Autism depends on how much metal how

46
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,200
much is settled in the midline canal how

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,480
much is also sprinkled about in the left

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,819
and right hemispheres

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,160
when these Metals take up resonance in

50
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,400
the midline canal they block internal

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,099
Communications within the brain as a

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,099
result the brain must adapt so what

53
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,620
happens is Communications inside the

54
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,959
brain is blocked from the metals you've

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,819
got electricity going through the brain

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,620
right here everybody has a certain

57
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:41,000
amount of electrical current going

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,920
through some run hotter some run cooler

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,120
some intense is really intensified

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,580
depending on what's Happening

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,739
emotionally what's going on in our lives

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,099
but either way we have this electrical

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,319
grid running through the brain and then

64
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,480
the midline canal being filled with

65
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,160
Mercury and aluminum and mercury and

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,500
aluminum being sprinkled about within

67
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,080
the brain

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,879
Communications get interfered with

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,900
so when these Metals take up resonance

70
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,700
inside the midline canal there has to be

71
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,860
adapting we need that ability because

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,920
internal Communications within the brain

73
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,140
get messed up so let's read a little bit

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,019
more this is why you often find a child

75
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,540
with ADHD behaving in one manner

76
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,720
when you're asking them to behave in

77
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,400
another the evolving domestic chemicals

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,140
children are up against and adults are

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,040
another problem on its own so let's go

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,440
into that

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,780
so not only do we get the Mercury and

82
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,519
aluminum inside the brain and that

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,379
interferes with communication because

84
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,900
electrical grid is hitting them so let's

85
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,280
hit that area too talk about that so as

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,239
electricity is traveling through the

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,540
brain

88
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,840
it's hitting these Mercury and aluminum

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,780
deposits when it does the actual

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,540
electrical current ricochets or gets

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,700
derailed into adjacent tissue throughout

92
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,519
the brain this makes communication

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,860
difficult or focused and concentration

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,720
or so many other different symptoms

95
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,019
along with it

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,900
when it comes down to an aluminum is

97
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,640
more present than mercury in many ways

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,139
for some people and then Mercury is more

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,060
present than aluminum from some other

100
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,519
people you guys I'm reading out a brain

101
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,560
saver we're just talking about ADHD now

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,960
in this book here

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
brain saver protocols now remember I

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,479
don't know if you guys know this is

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
because I was talking about this the

106
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,419
other day

107
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,960
that's one big book right there okay and

108
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:40,199
it had to be broken into two huge books

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,199
right because it was too big to publish

110
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,600
this is brain saver protocols so let's

111
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,979
go into this section here brain server

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,500
protocols and ADHD is right here in one

113
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,380
of the protocols now that's just one

114
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,080
part of this book 300 symptoms

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,139
conditions in here and then there's the

116
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,120
brain shot therapies you guys when you

117
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,220
apply the brain shot therapies it's a

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,900
new medical medium tool that's in these

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,759
books you will be so impressed at the

120
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,680
instant relief of the brain shot

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,540
therapies which is a therapeutic tool

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,139
it's a medical medium tool inside the

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,699
brain saver books but hey when you have

124
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,680
them in your hand and you check that out

125
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,539
you'll be like whoa so let's go into

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,400
this a little bit longer now too we'll

127
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,220
we'll take another look

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,979
so I'm in symptoms and conditions right

129
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,280
here inside inside insect brain saver

130
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,440
symptoms and conditions that's where I

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
am so right before ADHD it says

132
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,660
addiction that's one right there then

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,419
there's ALS then there's anxiousness

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,780
then there's Alzheimer's anorexia

135
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,580
anxiety there's autism there's Bell's

136
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,720
Palsy there's brain fog there's bipolar

137
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,699
disorder

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,259
there's balance and dizziness issues

139
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,479
there's brain inflammation it goes on

140
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:02,220
and on 300 different symptoms and

141
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:07,560
conditions and seven heavy metal detox

142
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:10,020
cleanses inside these books seven heavy

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,699
metal detox cleanses inside these inside

144
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,380
these books which is really incredible

145
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:19,020
so back to ADHD so what you'll hear

146
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,820
often out there is it's genetic and what

147
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,860
people don't realize is that toxic heavy

148
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,680
metals are passed down from generation

149
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,680
to generation to generation that's how

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
it's done so in the womb in utero we

151
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,160
take metals on that's what happens is as

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,759
a baby we actually absorb Metals inside

153
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,340
the brain from the family line going

154
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,740
back further and further and further 500

155
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,419
years 700 years a thousand years

156
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,660
generation after generation after

157
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:51,120
generation toxic heavy metals are passed

158
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,940
along the way and then we pick up new

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,840
toxic heavy metals and then we as adults

160
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,699
pass it on to the next Generation so

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,560
what you'll see out there now and you'll

162
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,440
find that a lot more children are

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,180
getting ADHD a lot of adults too and

164
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,479
it's worsening out there because more

165
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,460
Metals including domestic metals and

166
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,380
inherited metals are getting into our

167
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,900
children and adults and it's being

168
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,840
passed on Generation generation also

169
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,759
gathered here every single day as these

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,340
Metals get into the brain it interferes

171
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,380
with communication the electrical grid

172
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,360
and some people have it worse than

173
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,759
others that's why there's the scale is

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,699
so huge that's why the scale for autism

175
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,380
the scale for ADHD is so big because

176
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,139
there's so many different variables

177
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,840
where are the metals what kind of metals

178
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,000
how many of them are they deposited are

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,639
they just sprinkled about how much metal

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is in the midline canal all of this

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,699
changes everything to behavior to the

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,919
symptom condition Focus concentration to

183
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,380
understanding information to being able

184
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,979
to communicate and talk all of it

185
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,199
changes to the how hyperactive if how

186
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,000
not like all of it matters and changes

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,940
