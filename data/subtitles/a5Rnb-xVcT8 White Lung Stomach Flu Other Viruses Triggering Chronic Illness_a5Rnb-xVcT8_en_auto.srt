1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
are you seeing it out there people catch

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,759
a bug they get sick they're coughing

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,000
they got fevers going up and down they

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,279
start to recover they go to a doctor

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,680
they get on an antibiotic whatever it is

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,880
they start to recover and then they stay

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,359
sick they think they're going to recover

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,920
and bounce back completely but they're

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,920
dragging or 2 weeks later they're doing

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,239
a little better and then it hits them

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,559
and they're dragging and they're going

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,000
down and what's happening out there

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,559
people are getting sick and then they're

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
falling into this chronically ill

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,079

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,840

body and aches and pains and fatigue and

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,520
brain fog again and they just don't feel

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,120
themselves and now they're triggered

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,640
into something entirely different

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,120
because of the bugs going around right

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,480

happens if you get the neuro virus and

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,720
you got the stomach flu and it's ripping

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
through your guts and you're sitting

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,360

45
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,799
what happens when boom you get that

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
neuro virus and you got the stomach flu

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200

so it's good information very important

87
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,760
but I'm here to talk about our immune

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
system and how it's getting pretty beat

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
up these days with what people are going

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
through do you know anybody that's

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760
coughing do you know anybody that's got

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,920
a sore throat and a fever do you know

93
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,519
anybody who's been hit with anything

94
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,840
that's going on because people have been

95
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,360
getting hit it's like a insurgence of it

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,439
insurgence of it happening right now

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
this is like one of those hot spots

98
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,560
we're in where it's just really starting

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,239
to pick up pace I hear it all the time

100
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,400
people are sick for a month with it

101
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:49,280
coughing out their lungs the whole bit

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,599
but then to add insult to injury there

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,079
is a Norovirus stomach flu hyper catchy

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,159
hyper catchy that's actually steaming

105
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,040
streaming right out of new England land

106
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,360
right now and it's going to be cutting

107
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,280
across the country and you know overseas

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
and everywhere else and that one really

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
sucks really really sucks so what I'm

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,599
doing right now is the reason why I'm

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,600
even here is because I'm saying are you

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,199
taking care of your immune system are

113
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,440
you taking care of your immune system

114
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,520
right so I have my family on this right

115
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,199
here just a safeguard I need a safeguard

116
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,639
my family and my closest friends you

117
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,000
know safeguarding them too and all that

118
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,080
so that's the total immune blend do you

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
have it and what's crazy out there is

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
what I'm seeing right now is all these

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,120
different supplements are coming out

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440

123
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,199

the to immune I'm living off of it to

134
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,120
protect myself cuz I can't get sick

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,240

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,759
cold but you know how there's no colds

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,039
anyway but it's this back in stock it's

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
back and stock so I give you a little

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,919
closeup on this before I move on because

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,160
we're going to talk about some stuff in

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,319
the immune system which is really

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,039
important so that's total immune blend

145
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,000
right

146
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,080
there there it is that's the vimergy I

147
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,160
don't know if you guys see it there it

148
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,120
is

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,000
very important critical critical um

150
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,280
resource right there it's got the time

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,319
it's got the Mullin it's back in stock

152
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,479
it's sold out like this when it came out

153
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,280
so a lot of people armed themselves and

154
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,880
armed their immune systems for what was

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,280
coming but I want to talk about even

156
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,720
more than that I want to go into like

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,560
what people are dealing with post

158
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,240
getting sick and what they're dealing

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,280
with pre getting sick because everybody

hasn't immune system problems and that's

161
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,319
that's a big thing right there all on

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
its own if you got a

163
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,240

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,960
it's struggling that's the whole point

185
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,240
it can't handle exposures it can't

186
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
handle the toxic heavy metal exposures

187
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,759
and then the herbicide and the fungicide

188
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,720
exposures and the

189
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,720
fragrances and the caffeine addiction it

190
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,360
can't handle the immune system can't

191
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,720
handle that so many people are drowning

192
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,080
themselves with coffee and espresso

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,919
drinks and they're just beating the crap

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,240
out of their immune system so immune

195
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,240
system is just under attack all the time

196
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,160
and So eventually what that leads us to

197
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,560
is a sickness no matter what

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
but everyone is going to get a symptom

199
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,720
no matter what you see somebody out

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
there right now they're on social like

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,639
yeah I'm doing this and do and that I'm

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Into Fitness I'm into this you're going

203
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,240
to have a symptom you're going to have a

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,479
symptom it's going to come later maybe

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
but you're going to be pushed over the

206
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,960
edge too many exposures your immune

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
system is going to finally kick down and

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,960
you're going to be in the immune system

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
pit just like everybody else so keeping

210
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,440
our immune system strong is critical

211
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,199
having immune system power is

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,360
critical having it strong and you'll

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,000

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,920
entirely to a point where all articles

everywhere and that's the world we live

255
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,720
in that's the world we're going to be

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,360
living and and that's how crazy it

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
really is when you really think about it

258
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,000
right I mean did you ever expect that

259
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,240
did you ever expect

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
that yeah you're not alone so let's talk

261
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,440
about the immune system a little bit and

262
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
why it's so important to support it not

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,000
just support it rebuild

264
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,920
it rebuild it critical really is writing

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,399
for truth on IG says do you take the

266
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,680
total immune blend every day even when

267
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:11,640
not sick I do I take it every single day

268
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,399
even when not sick I take it every day

269
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,160
okay but you can take it every day right

270
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,440
do what your doctor wants to do but I

271
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,320
tell my family you can take it every day

272
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,640
but you can take a smaller dosage if

273
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,360
you're not sick every single day then

274
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,440
when you get sick or you're struggling

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
with something you can increase the the

276
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,120
dosage to what your whatever doctor

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,079
leaves or however what's in it a thyme

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,240
blend of thyme and Mullen and a little

279
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,920
touch of zinc it's this perfect

280
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
combination right here and what people

281
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,480
don't realize it's the quality of the

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,360
time on top of it it's the quality of

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,279
the Mullen that you don't get in other

284
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,120
places it doesn't happen it just doesn't

285
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,680
I know I know the quality I know what

286
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,639
they do I know how they do it and it's

287
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,120
unbelievable able it's about making sure

288
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,519
that alcohol wasn't used that alcohol is

289
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,800
not involved at any level making sure

290
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,399
all these different things matter that

291
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,600
this is really clean but the real thing

292
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
not everybody saying good quality this

293
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,560
is good quality everybody's allowed to

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
say that did you know that you're

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,920
allowed to say everything's good quality

296
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
did you know that anybody who just opens

297
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
up a door hangs a shingle and sells

298
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,320
something they're allowed to say our

299
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,240
quality is great nothing beats our

300
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,200
quality there is a difference huge

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,000
difference that's important to know it

302
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,519

Matter Details Matter I agree I see that

309
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
right there okay so let's go into it a

310
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,880
little

311
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,959
bit all right couple of things to know

312
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,399
one

313
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,639
is why are immune systems so chopped up

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,519
why are they so beat up and that's

315
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,800
something that nobody really talks about

316
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,959
they're just like this is immune

317
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,519
supportive immune supportive everybody's

318
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
immune system is just beaten to a pulp

319
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,079
basically and that's why everybody's so

320
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,440
sick it's struggling immune system you

321
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,480
got to remember that if there's anything

322
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,959
someone's dealing with instantly the

323
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,279
immune system is under siege Under Siege

324
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,440
if someone's got panic attacks and they

325
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,000
got the Titan chest and they got that

326
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,079
vagus nerve I talk about that vag nerves

327
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,800
the

328
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,639
inflammation and they're dealing with

329
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,920
all kinds of anxiety and panic and all

330
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,760
these other things immune system

331
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,399
everything is like that thyroid

332
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,040
condition at all thyroid anybody

333
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,680
hypothyroid hyperthyroid any kind of

334
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:04,040
thyroid problems at all anything grave

335
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,240
whatever it is nodules in the thyroid

336
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,680
whatever it is immune system was

337
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,240
challenged the thyroids immune system

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,480
was challenged the liver's immune system

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,680
was challenged and then weakened and

340
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,600
then kicked down a notch so people walk

341
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,120
around with weak immune systems that's

342
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,320
what they do all day long and then the

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,720
thyroid disorders creep up and then the

344
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,760
panic and the aches and pains creep up

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
and then the vertigo and the tentis and

346
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,000
the Les and numbness and the body aches

347
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,519
and pains and the trigeminal neuralgia

348
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,320
all creep up because their immune system

349
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,240
is suffering their immune system is

350
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,079
struggling so very important to know so

351
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,760
let's talk about like stomach flu I want

352
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:50,639
to go into that a little bit stomach

353
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,120
flu okay so the reason why I would take

354
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,639
like something every single day or I

355
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,160
tell family to take something every

356
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,600
single day like I tell my family take a

357
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
little bit of this take a little bit of

358
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,360
the

359
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
every single day right little bit of the

360
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,639
golden seal every single day this is

361
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,360
what I tell my family to do all the time

362
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,440
and a little bit of B12 and I want to

363
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,639
talk about why B12 is critical cuz when

364
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,759
we catch something like the neuro virus

365
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,639
or white lung yeah which is really

366
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,079
hurting a lot of people I mean they get

367
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,240
scar tissue in the lung that lasts

368
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,079
forever I mean that's just unfair like

369
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,519
why do they put bugs out there like this

370
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,240
so that we get injuries in our lungs and

371
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,759
then for lifetime we actually have scar

372
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,279
tissue in our lungs like does that make

373
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:39,199
any sense so I tell my friends and

374
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,680
family it's critical to get B12 in you

375
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,639
after especially after you've been hit

376
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,759
with something because you need that

377
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,720
extra B12 to power up the nerves so

378
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,480
important that alone okay and so what

379
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,279
I'm telling my family right now with all

380
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,199
these these hard times of people getting

381
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,880
sick cuz it's it's really sad when you

382
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
see somebody really struggling they get

383
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,800
what feels like a cold to start with

384
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,800
then it then it lingers then it runs

385
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,160
into a fever and up and down and then

386
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,399
after that when they're better they're

387
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,120
not better because now their immune

388
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,279
system was dropped and they were

389
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,160
triggered into something else an epine

390
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,519
bar rising up out of nowhere herb

391
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,880
simplex one rising up from nowhere

392
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,160
because that's what's happening to

393
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,120
people people are getting shingles a

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,600
month after they get white lung a month

395
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120
later they have the shingles because

396
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
their immune system was so kicked down

397
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,720
to the bottom that the jingles virus

398
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,959
said this is my time to shine and then

399
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,880
it comes up and it just boom it's up

400
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,000
there let's talk about the Norovirus

401
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,399
that's coming around and it's

402
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,120
circulating right now and it's it's

403
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,160
kicking up so right now there's a

404
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,000
stomach bug out there and what people

405
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,720
don't realize is that a stomach bug can

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,560
knock your gut balance off for a really

407
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,680
long time really long time but what you

408
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,040
what you'll never see out there is what

409
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,519
happens inside the intestinal tract when

410
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,720
that bug is around so let's go into that

411
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,000
let's let's try to like makeshift a

412
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,240
little bit of an intestinal track

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,759
okay so let's do that we'll make shift a

414
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:23,079
little bit of a a colon here

415
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,839
right all right and then we'll just do a

416
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,920
little intestinal track in the center

417
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,519
here if you guys can see this

418
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,480
okay

419
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,000
so you pick up the stomach flu pick up

420
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,079
the neuro virus you get it in your

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,880
mouth just goes in you you breathing in

422
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:45,079
it's on your tongue now it's heading

423
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,519
down to your gut okay and it's on its

424
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:51,759
way so that virus is getting there okay

425
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,560
virus goes down the dadum it's it starts

426
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,519
in your stomach right it goes down your

427
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,959
stomach in your dadum it's heading in

428
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,240
there and what that virus is doing is

429
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,240
it's multiplying really fast and it's

430
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,720
feeding off of foods that you eat so

431
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,160
it's multiplying it's exploding so what

432
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,480
a stomach virus does is it proliferates

433
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,079
at a speed no other bug Pro proliferates

434
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,640
no other bug fires up to that degree to

435
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,760
multiplies to that degree spawns to that

436
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,840
degree but the neuro virus

437
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,960
explodes and it feeds off of undigested

438
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,720
proteins it feeds off of gluten that's

439
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,640
in the system from something you ate a

440
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,559
week ago yeah a week ago it feeds off of

441
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,559
any egg residue egg material any kind of

442
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:45,280
egg material in your gut it feeds off of

443
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,480
that and then it feeds off of any dairy

444
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,000
products and then it feeds off of other

445
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,600
things it'll feed off of soy

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,159
potentially it'll feed off of virtually

447
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,760
anything right so what it does is it

448
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:04,559
feeds and it explodes it

449
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,600
produces itself rapidly like rapidly and

450
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,120
it's highly toxic so what the Norovirus

451
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,280
is is it's a bug that when it produces

452
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,280
the bug then goes to the intestinal

453
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,640
lining walls and it starts to make

454
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,280
divots it starts to basically try to

455
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
poke holes in your intestinal tract and

456
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,000
your colon but nobody talks about this

457
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,480
they're just like you got a stomach bug

458
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,760
you know that's it wait till it's over

459
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,760
and then take a probiotic

460
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,240
so that's what they'll say some of the

461
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
best functional medicine doctors will be

462
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,400
like well you got a stomach flu um go to

463
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,720
the hospital you got a stomach flu and

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,720
then make sure you get on our probiotics

465
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,640
at our clinic or or our doctor's office

466
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,520
make sure you get on our probiotics so

467
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,280
that's all they do but what people don't

468
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:55,640
realize is that

469
00:18:50,280 --> 00:19:01,080
virus is mean really mean so stomach

470
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:06,440
bugs stomach flu EXP load they multiply

471
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:10,840
fast real fast thousands upon thousands

472
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,360
of replicas then all those bugs end up

473
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,840
attaching themselves to everything the

474
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,760
stomach lining the dadum lining the

475
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,280
small in top of the small intestinal

476
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,600
track all through and as it's happening

477
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,240
if you have a weakened immune system

478
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,280
it's not slowing it down it's not

479
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,760
stopping it and instead that person is

480
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,200
now diarrhea they got stomach pains

481
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,440
they're really nauseous they got a fever

482
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,520
cranking

483
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,559
up because their immune system isn't

484
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,559
stopping it it's not breaking it down so

485
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,440
their immune cells are not there's not

486
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,960
enough immune cells number one to stop

487
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
the neuro virus to that degree and if

488
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,559
someone has a weakened immune system

489
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,240
then they really have very small amounts

490
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,640
of immune cells going into this area

491
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,880
trying to stop the neuro virus so the

492
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,280
neuro virus the stomach flu the stomach

493
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,799
bugs what they do is they attack the

494
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,679
Linings of the small intestinal tract

495
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,159
and this is why people get Pockets later

496
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,039
this is why people get divots

497
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,080
diverticulitis

498
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:23,039
diverticulosis this is why people end up

499
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,240
with crohn's later on meaning a trigger

500
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,679
to get into Crohn's where other bugs can

501
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,240
actually contribute it's all about not

502
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,720
knocking the immune system down allowing

503
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,840
other problems to happen there's people

504
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,039
who get stomach flu that never have a

505
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,799
normal stomach intestinal track ever

506
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,400
again in their life they don't know how

507
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,520
to recover it they know don't know how

508
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,080
to rebuild it they don't know about Mono

509
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,679
eating from the medical medium book

510
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,679
series they don't know about all these

511
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,919
different things they can do they're

512
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,400
just stuck their intestinal tract is

513
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,679
rocked for a very long time and then if

514
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,840
they're older and they're not younger

515
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,159
and they're older it affects them even

516
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,000
more because they already have

517
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,600
intestinal tract issues on so many

518
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,159
levels so the neuro virus explodes and

519
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,200
then it attaches itself to the Linings

520
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,159
of the intestinal tract and if you're

521
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,000
somebody that has pockets of undigested

522
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,000
protein from a weak liver that I talked

523
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,320
about in the last episode or if you're

524
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,120
somebody that's dealing with anything

525
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,520
like putrified rancid fats that are

526
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,760
caked along your intestinal track old

527
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,159
feal matter that's just stuck there and

528
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:40,080
plastered against the intestinal Linings

529
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:42,320
and bad bacteria like strep it all Rises

530
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,640
up so the neuro virus and the stomach

531
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,679
flu and the stomach bugs go ripping

532
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,240
through you and then it awakens all the

533
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,200
strep all the staff all the tiny bits of

534
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,120
SEI that you were keeping under control

535
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,279
you know just managing your immune

536
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,039
system was managing all this time and

537
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,520
then what

538
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,159
happens is we get triggered now we have

539
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,679
all kinds of intestinal tract

540
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,440
disturbances years later down the road a

541
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,360
month later so as the virus is ripping

542
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,400
through the gut it's clinging to the

543
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,320
wall of the intestinal tract and it

544
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,360
starts to try to burrow holes inside the

545
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,159
intestinal tract just like white lung is

546
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,919
doing to people when they're getting the

547
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,480
C and they're getting the flu and the C

548
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,640
and the RS V in the white lung right now

549
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,559
and it's going in it's injuring lung

550
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,559
sacks well the stomach flu is

551
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,640
created

552
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,440
manufactured to injure the lining of

553
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,480
your intestinal

554
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:52,559
tract stomach dadum and so forth it's

555
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,720
there to scar tissue and burrow and

556
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:59,159
weaken the

557
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,360
lining and wake up other predator

558
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,520
that lie inside of our intestinal tract

559
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,559
like the strep and the seiff and

560
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,159
different varieties of staff and the

561
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,840
hpylori

562
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,320
so as that neuro virus and that stomach

563
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,279
flu is ripping through and exploding and

564
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,000
people are having like explosions of

565
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,600
diarrhea and they're sick and they're

566
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,120
nauseous and they're throwing up or

567
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,960
they're fevered and they're getting the

568
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,039
runs and they're really struggling for a

569
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,200
day or two sometimes a week right now

570
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,080
there's one that's ripping through

571
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,520
that's really messing people up

572
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,120
and when that's happening it wakes up

573
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,200
the strep it wakes up SEI it wakes up

574
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,720
staff it wakes up other bugs like

575
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,799
viruses that could be in the intestinal

576
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,600
tract and then it tries to burrow holes

577
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:48,039
in the Linings because that's what it

578
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,200
does the bugs go in and they try to

579
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:54,320
destroy tissue so they're cell

580
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,200
destroyers the reason why we're having

581
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,520
diarrhea and fever and everything else

582
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,720
around it is cuz our body is

583
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,840
reacting and mucus is being produced off

584
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,039
the lining of her intestinal tract

585
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,400
because it's burrowing little holes tiny

586
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,760
little divots in our intestinal tract

587
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,520
and so our intestinal tract is releasing

588
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,360
gobs and gobs of mucus and water and

589
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,640
mucus and it's just streaming out it's

590
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,279
streaming out to try to defend against

591
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,559
the Invader but the Invader causes a lot

592
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,000
of Havoc reaches a lot reaks a lot of

593
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,559
havoc and a probiotic is not going to

594
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,679
fix it after a really bad stomach flu a

595
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,440
fever and also intestinal tract being

596
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,919
invaded like that it takes time to heal

597
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,480
it takes time to eat the right Foods it

598
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,880
takes time to understand what you're

599
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,080
doing and it's critical to keep the

600
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,600
immune system

601
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,880
strong

602
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,039
so I just wanted to show you that right

603
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000
there and there's other stuff to talk

604
00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:00,320
about cuz we are here talking about the

605
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
fun stuff for sure all right then move

606
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,640
this over a little

607
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,720
bit

608
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,559
okay it takes a tremendous amount of

609
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,880
adrenaline to fend off any bug that's

610
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:15,640
out there right now any kind of flu any

611
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,559
kind of sea any kind of white lung RSV

612
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,760
any kind of neuro virus or stomach virus

613
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,760
it takes

614
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,240
adrenaline heart rate goes

615
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,440
up as you're getting sick your heart

616
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,000
rate goes up that's how it works because

617
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,000
epinephrine is being being released

618
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,919
adrenaline is being released to try to

619
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,200
protect you but adrenaline itself

620
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,960
doesn't help the immune system so what

621
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,039
these bugs do and these viruses do that

622
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,440
get into us when they get into us our

623
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,440
adrenals end up fire alarming it and

624
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,480
releasing all this adrenaline to try to

625
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,279
because that's actually this response

626
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
this automics response that's happening

627
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,600
immediately when an Invader enters into

628
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,640
our system but as that's happening our

629
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,080
immune cells are struggling even more

630
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,039
because we have so much adrenaline

631
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,720
pouring into our bloodstream and immune

632
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:12,960
cells hate adrenaline hate adrenaline it

633
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
holds them back it keeps them from

634
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,640
functioning as good as they can function

635
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,960
so our immune cells need

636
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,960
fuel need

637
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,440
fuel and that's why I talk about like I

638
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,960
have my family and my closest friends on

639
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,640
protocols I have them on

640
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,799
supplements it's critical because when

641
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,240
you get sick if you're somewhere and

642
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,919
look no one has no one has it perfect

643
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,279
where well man you know what I could be

644
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,000
wrong about that there's people on

645
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,919
Instagram that they never have to work a

646
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,480
day in their life right they're young

647
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,240
they come for money or something or

648
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,320
they're just extremely wealthy or

649
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,760
whatever it is everything's taken care

650
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,080
of and all they have to do is sleep 12

651
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,799
hours every night they could sleep as

652
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,039
many hours as they want they don't have

653
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,120
to stress out about work they don't have

654
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,520
to they just worry about their

655
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,720
appointments their stress is their

656
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,600
appointments like I'm getting my

657
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,480
lymphatic drainage here I'm getting this

658
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,320
here I'm doing this here I'm going on a

659
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
vacation here with my friends here I'm

660
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,919
going to Europe whatever it is that's

661
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,880
their stress right and there are people

662
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,440
like that and they can at least protect

663
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,799
themselves because they're not living

664
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,640
with a lot of real life scenarios

665
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,240
situations they're not trying to work

666
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,840
three jobs to survive they don't have

667
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,559
you know like all these problems in

668
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,159
their life meaning from other family

669
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,279
members or something happening and they

670
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,480
don't you know there's a lot going on in

671
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,039
a lot of people's lives and we can't

672
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,200
help it because there's so many people

673
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,919
that don't have that perfect life life

674
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,480
where they can just relax all day long

675
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,399
and never have to worry about working a

676
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,720
day in their life you know there's a lot

677
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,279
of people that are struggling and they

678
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,120
have to fight to survive and when you do

679
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,519
that right we're always up against a lot

680
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,960
and it's important to keep our immune

681
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,760
system strong and in the eventually

682
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,679
someone who has it really good in their

683
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,519
life and they're young and strong now

684
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,200
still will get symptoms later they'll

685
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,159
still wind up in trouble they'll still

686
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,360
wind up sick I see it all the time but

687
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,120
it usually comes later instead of

688
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,799
early let's see sole purpose on IG says

689
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,240

but that's how they set it up you have

698
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,640
to understand that's how they set it up

699
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,399
so that's what they do okay so let's do

700
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559

Whiteboard okay I don't know why my

702
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,399
whiteboard doesn't really work that

703
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:49,080

right

709
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,919
okay that is the bug manufacturing plant

710
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,919
that's what that is that's right that's

711
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,760

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,640
plant yes

713
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,679

let out all kinds of stuff out their

726
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,640

bugs lots of bugs and they do it

730
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,320
purposely and they time it just right

731
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,320
okay and these bugs end up going to the

732
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,320
village and everybody gets

733
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,840
sick apologize for my my writing

734
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,679
my artistry

735
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:37,120
skills I did not go to art

736
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:40,240
school and uh I wish I did I really do

737
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,519
anyway listen so check this out you guys

738
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,360
bugs are layered on top of bugs

739
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:51,679
purposely so they release them with a

740
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,320
schedule okay so there's a

741
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,919
schedule there it is here got all the

742
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,760
different days of the

743
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,600
month

744
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,200
right here's the first here's the second

745
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:08,039
here's the third the fourth the fifth

746
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,760
each month they release one flu bug on

747
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,360
the first of whatever day of the month

748
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,880
they want to release it

749
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,080
on when they know it's gotten out there

750
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,919
good enough and it's running its course

751
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,320
they time it and they have schedules and

752
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,200
they release another one on another

753
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:28,240
month maybe they'll release it on the 3D

754
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,880
okay they layer the manufactured bugs

755
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,639
purposely so it kicks the crap out of

756
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,320
people they want you to be

757
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:42,039
triggered and injured so you're kept

758
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,200
down and you feed the system that's how

759
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:49,480
it's done see so you catch the one flu

760
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,440
six weeks ago you catch another flu 3

761
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,360
weeks ago you catch the stomach flu last

762
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,559
week it's layered they put them out like

763
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,639
that and they want everybody in the

764
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:06,039
village to get sick everybody and they

765
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:08,960
want older people elderly people to die

766
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:11,679
correct they want them to die and get

767
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,799
knocked off that's how it's done they

768
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,960
want them sick and they want them gone

769
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,519
that's how the system is set up it's a

770
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,519
kind of a fun little system isn't

771
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,529
[Music]

772
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,440
it they Manu facture the bugs and they

773
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,559
then they stick the bugs in a

774
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,639
containment unit with a bunch of white

775
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,600
mice and they see if the mice all die

776
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:41,279
they see if the mice live they see if

777
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,440
the mice chalk you know cough and choke

778
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,159
on fleem they see if the mice have

779
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,639
diarrhea all around the mouse

780
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,480
tank and then they kind of say well

781
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,399
we're ready and they eventually let it

782
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,200
out that's the system that's way it's

783
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,519
built lady paath over there in IG just

784
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,320
said I really appreciate how you pointed

785
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,159
out that most of us have so many

786
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,399
stresses bringing down our immune

787
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:12,559
systems indeed everybody does I am

788
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,760
included in that I am not immune to that

789
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,600
I have stress just like anybody else

790
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,720
plenty of it in fact a lot of it and

791
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,840
that's what happens when you have the

792
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,360
most healing stories on the planet of

793
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,000

794
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,080
with multiple sceris that got out of

795
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,080
wheelchairs in

796
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,279

who somebody in the influencer world is

799
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,840
stealing and poaching it and using it

800
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,799
because they can't get their own

801
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,919
information and all these people are

802
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:46,559
healing around the world and it creates

803
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,039
tremendous amount of stress that's how

804
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,240
it works you're not allowed to get

845
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,320

847
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,079
this right here do you guys know about

848
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,280
this can I show you this is also a

849
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
collagen

850
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,520
Builder and the one thing about medical

851
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,480
medum information is I was the first to

852
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,400
blow the horn on the BS [ __ ]

853
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,720
collagen Market where the collagen

854
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,359
Market was selling all this collagen but

855
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,119
you can't build collagen eating collagen

856
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,000
just like you can't fix your eye eating

857
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,720
an eyeball you can't eat a pig's eyeball

858
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,119
to fix your eyeball you can't eat a

859
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,319
liver to fix your liver it doesn't work

860
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,560
that's not how it works you can't

861
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,800
rebuild collagen in your body you can't

862
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,160
rebuild collagen in your body eating

863
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,280
collagen it's not going to happen so

864
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,160
medical medium information was the first

865
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,680
to call that out that you can't get

866
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,960
better on collagen you can only build

867
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,160
your collagen with collagen Builders

868
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,839
that's how you do

869
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
it all right so I got some water heated

870
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,800

I mean this this is actually exciting

951
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,440
this cheers me up because I've been

952
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,680
wanting to talk about some of the things

953
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,119
that I'm using my family's using the

954
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,079
medical medium Skin Potion have you

955
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,319
tried it which is the MSM it's the

956
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,960
vitamin C right the micro C and let me

957
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:24,359
just be clear about this so you guys

958
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,480
know okay if you're interested this

959
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,680
isn't ascorbic acid this isn't the thing

960
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,680
that burns holes in people's

961
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,720
stomachs that that's what I'm talking

962
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,240
about that's a different difference with

963
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,839
vimergy that is the difference right

964
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
there because people don't realize that

965
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,520
they go and take the ascorbic acid and

966
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,400
next thing you know they got the runs

967
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,440
they got diarrhea they got stomach upset

968
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,359
it's burning their Linings it's burning

969
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,440
their gut if they're sensitive they had

970
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,880
ulcers in the past and they're taking

971
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,640
all that ascorbic acid it's in there

972
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,560
like sizzling up the ulcers like I I

973
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,599
can't I can't even go even go there like

974
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,240
I will never take an ascorbic acid

975
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,520
straight ascorbic acid vitamin C ever

976
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,040
again in my life I've taken it when

977
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,960
there is nothing else available out

978
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,560
there in the world I've taken it when

979
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,760
there was nothing available I will never

980
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,640
ever ever take a Scorpio ass trate to

981
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,920
Scorpi acid vitamin C ever again ever

982
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,680
and so I'm just I'm just like I know

983
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,400
that I'm blessed to know that this is

984
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,960
out there for me to take personally for

985
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,520
my health and for people to take

986
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,040
personally for their health and I'm

987
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,319
blessed to know that this is actually

988
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,960
here it's just it's incredible this

989
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,880
isn't about like supplementation and

990
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,000
supplements and selling supp this is

991
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,920
about stuff that literally is critical

992
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,040
for life like because of what it is and

993
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,359
what they do it's it's a real Mission

994
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
that's the difference with vimergy and

995
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,280
then people just trying to Hawk

996
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,520
supplements grifter H you know selling

997
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,280
and Hawking supplements because they're

998
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,440
just trying to make a buck big

999
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,560
difference I don't own this company I

1000
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,200
don't have a percentage a share stock

1001
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,640

you right now I know what they're doing

1003
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,359

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,000
endorse them like flying colors kind of

1005
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,640

1038
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,359
podcast like some influencer guy was on

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,119

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,440
bugs do it knocks them down and their

now they're sick and it's unfair it's

1050
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,760
not right that this happens to people we

1051
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,680
shouldn't have to live our lives sick

1052
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,559
life is short and as it is life is short

always checking in case you don't get

1118
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:49,599
notified yeah I know okay okay so the

1119
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,920
total immune is really revolutionary all

1120
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,640
on its own okay it's like with me I I

1121
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,760
know that people need their immune

1122
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,559
system strengthened

1123
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,480
but they need them

1124
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:07,680
rebuilt rebuilt not just fortified not

1125
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,880
just strengthened not just supported but

1126
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,920
rebuilt because that's the kind of

1127
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,160
immune system trouble so many people are

1128
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:19,240
in thyroid problems hypo hyper you know

1129
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,680
nodules cysts on the thyroid whether

1130
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:24,040
they're tiny or large people that deal

1131
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,319
with all kinds of issues under the sun

1132
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,640
everything from neurological problems

1133
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:31,760
from skin problems our immune systems

1134
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:35,119
are under attack from everything from

1135
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,720
fragrances and anything people who drink

1136
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,240

drink okay and then suddenly now years

1146
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,319
after I've been talking about how bad

1147
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,839
alcohol is and I was getting crap for it

1148
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,839
that was taboo you weren't allowed to

1149
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,960
talk about it on a podcast anywhere you

1150
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,599
weren't allowed to about talk about it

1151
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,160
on social you mentioned that alcohol was

1152
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,160
bad everybody The Gauntlet came down on

1153
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,319

1154
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,040

00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,800
with it stayed with it talked about

1156
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,720
stayed with it was heavy on it said no

1157
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,559
you can't do this if you want to heal

1158
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,160
you got to get off alcohol it's bad for

1159
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,440
you whatever and then now guess what

1160
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,280
they're all paring it now like yeah

1161
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,119
alcohol is bad for your brain really cuz

1162
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,400
science doesn't say that where did you

1163
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,960
get that

1164
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,160
idea all right look what I like about

1165
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,359
total

1166
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,160
immune okay

1167
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,200
is

1168
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,480
um the fact that it works that's just

1169
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:02,440
one right off the the bat Mei over there

1170
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,240
on YouTube I noticed that Mayo Clinic

1171
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Now talks about non- rashing shingles no

1172
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,040
mention of the source um there is a

1173
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,240
hijacking of the medical medium non-

1174
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,319
rashing shingles information both there

1175
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,280
at Mayo PubMed wherever all of all of it

1176
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,839
like they've just hijacked medical

1177
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,559
medium information with no science and

1178
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,119
no studies behind it no studies behind

1179
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,599
it and when you look when you look at

1180
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,240
whatever they show check this out how

1181
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,440
sick is this when they look when you

1182
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:35,440
look at what they show they're talking

1183
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,640
about post herpetic pain when the rash

1184
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,359
goes

1185
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,280
away but they're trying to chalk that up

1186
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,799
as it it's non- rashing shingles no they

1187
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,599
had the rash it went away and then they

1188
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:48,799
had pain for a year so science of

1189
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:52,839
research did do a couple of papers where

1190
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,880
you have pain for a year or more after

1191
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:56,839
shingles but that's not non- rashing

1192
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,799
shingles non- rashing shingles is

1193
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,680
medical medium information it's having

1194
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:03,839
shingles never a rash ever and having

1195
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,040
symptoms right well now they're claiming

1196
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,640
they knew that when they didn't no signs

1197
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,920
to back it up but mayo and everybody

1198
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:14,720
else is using medical Mee information on

1199
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,079
that just it's crazy you know what

1200
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,400
there's you know there's good news

1201
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:22,359
though because they're so evil that when

1202
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,880
you leave here that evil and you don't

1203
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:27,240
make good with that you don't resolve it

1204
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,880
you don't

1205
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,599
you don't work on that you don't come

1206
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,440
clean about like how many people you

1207
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,480
screwed over with chronic illness that

1208
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,000
couldn't get back to the source to heal

1209
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,040
and it's your fault that so many people

1210
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,799
aren't going to heal because you were

1211
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,319
evil and you didn't care and you stole

1212
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:47,920
that information to just manipulate

1213
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:50,720
people and then you're on your deathbed

1214
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,839
many years down the road you think

1215
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,319
you're just in the clear with that you

1216
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,319
think you're in the

1217
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,760
clear I say my medicinal home on YouTube

1218
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,520
propolis shock therapy is in the brain

1219
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,480
saver protocol book it helped heal my

1220
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,839
canker source and that's the propolis

1221
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,280
right there I'll give you a close-up on

1222
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,799
the propolis you

1223
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:19,280
guys I mean honestly look if you look if

1224
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:21,960
if you can get one thing one thing okay

1225
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,359
you can't you can't lose with total

1226
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,599
immune you can't lose with propolis pure

1227
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:31,000
if you can get twoo th things it's like

1228
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,920
total immune propolis pure right if you

1229
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,079
can get two things that's how critical

1230
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,799
that is for our immune systems right

1231
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:40,880
there that's how critical that is all

1232
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:42,960
right you guys we're talking about all

1233
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,000
kinds of good stuff flu and everything

1234
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,280
else in post flu and post RSV RSV and

1235
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,160
white lung and neuro viruses which are

1236
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,359
going around and we talked about like

1237
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,400
manufacturing they got the manufacturing

1238
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,960
plant right there they're growing the

1239
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,079
viruses spawning them right out of egg

1240
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,720
themselves and then they get released

1241
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:03,599
magically into our environment and it

1242
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,240
hits the village right here and then

1243
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,280
they calculate it on the calendar of

1244
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,680
when they're going to release the next

1245
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,440
one and next one because they want to

1246
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,319
clobber the crap out of everybody's

1247
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,480
immune system and they want elderly

1248
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,480
people to die early so that's the

1249
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,240
plan and if you don't believe it then

1250
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,359
fine it's all make

1251
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,200
believe sure we can think that maybe

1252
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:29,319
it's just all make believe and it never

1253
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,480
happened no and that's fine whatever you

1254
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:33,280
want to think but yeah it's interesting

1255
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,640
isn't it all right so what I'm doing

1256
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,839
right here is I am I got my total immune

1257
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,200
right there I take shots of it I put it

1258
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:43,520
in the shot glass just like this

1259
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,839
okay and I'm going to pop a little bit

1260
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,440
of orange juice so I want to talk about

1261
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,520
this there's a lot of people that even

1262
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,960
though these don't taste bad these taste

1263
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,319
good some of some of the vimergy

1264
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:56,000
products taste amazing that people don't

1265
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,720
like to use water they can use juice

1266
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,720
then so so here I got some fresh

1267
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,000

supplement my body first and foremost

1317
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,599
right always remember that even if

1318
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,280
you're not sleeping if you're just

1319
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,839
laying there and you're resting your

1320
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,079
nerves and your eyes are shut your

1321
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,839
immune system is recovering just from

1322
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,319
that alone and I want to say this this

1323
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:30,160
is very important for people who can't

1324
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,559
sleep or can't get enough sleep they're

1325
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,720
working hard everything's off right is

1326
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,039
that when you're even laying there

1327
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,039
you're laying there and you're calm and

1328
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,280
you're shutting your eyes your immune

1329
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:44,559
system is responding and it's

1330
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,119
reproducing and it's building back up

1331
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,960
even if you're just laying there you

1332
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:49,760
guys keep that in mind even if you're

1333
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,359

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,599
or you have some kind of sleep issue

1335
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,960
your immune system is sitting there

1336
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,520
building and rebuilding up when when

1337
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,839
you're actually just laying there with

1338
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,160

1339
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,319

1402
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,760
which has happened to people out there

1403
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,720
right it's like you know like there's a

1404
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,599
lot of things that I do to keep the

1405
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,200
immune system strong and you know what I

1406
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:58,079
do is I eat every couple of hours so

1407
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,559
that my dream aren't flooding so if you

1408
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,079
want to keep your immune system strong

1409
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:03,839
you want to build your immune system

00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,119
back up you make sure you're not

1411
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,240
trashing your adrenals get caffeine out

1412
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,599
of

1413
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,200
there get caffeine out that's critical

1414
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,200
by the way there's no science behind

1415
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,720
caffeine hurting the immune system but

1416
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,200
recently I saw something out there of

1417
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,559
somebody like yeah stay away from

1418
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,799
caffeine really because there's no

1419
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:25,039
science that says it they science says

1420
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:27,000
caffeine is good for you it's

1421
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,799
crazy

1422
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,599
so how it is the point is is staying

1423
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:35,160
away from caffeine eating every couple

1424
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,760
of hours don't intermittent

1426
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,079

1427
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,039

1434
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:59,640
you just trash your renals people who

01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,319
years ago and how great you were doing

1444
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,440
yeah but then I went to carnivore and

1445
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:21,880
then I got really sick on Carnivore and

1446
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,799
then I tried this and then I tried that

1447
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,079
and I was trying this new program that I

1448
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:27,520
just purchased for $5,000 from this guy

1449
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,160
says he's a chiropractor or something

1450
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,359
like and then I just did this and did

1451
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,240
that and people are just like they're

1452
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,079
everywhere and it's like Yeah because it

1453
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,119
didn't work intermittent fasting burns

1454
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,280
out the adrenals so what I like to do is

1455
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:44,280
I like to eat every couple of hours I'll

1456
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,920
have a banana I'll have some oranges

1457
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,200

together I'll have some kale and some

1468
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,920
dat I'm just saying that this is what I

1469
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,640
do and it's to keep the

1470
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,119
adrenals strong then I'll have some

1471
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,280
steamed potatoes later but it'll keep

1472
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,839
the adrenals strong and it'll also stop

1473
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,480
the adrenals from releasing and that

1474
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:28,920
lowers the immune system there's so many

1475
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,440
things you can do I mean that's what I

1476
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,359
do right there keeping myself like

1477
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:37,160
