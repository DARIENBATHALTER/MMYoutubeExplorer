1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
get sick what are the causes of sickness

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,759
why does everybody go around

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,279
looking for answers and they think they

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,040
have an answer but they really don't

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,880
have an answer and then they stay sick

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,960
another two months another six months

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
and then two years go by and then five

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
years go by and then 10 years go by i

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,480

been sick been sick for 25 years i'm

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
like oh my god and then they get the

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
answers and things start going away and

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
as things start going away they go

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,120
anthony why didn't i find you 25 years

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,000
ago and i'm like well

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,559
since this is 25 years ago

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
uh 25 years before that i would have

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
been very little so the point is is

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
people just they go around they look

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
around if they're trying to find help

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
and they can't find the answers and yet

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
this is a special time and it's not

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
about me it's not because i'm special or

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,680
anything like that is because

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,840
we have answers now it's it's the

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
information i get from the source i hear

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,240
right whether somebody likes that or not

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,360
or somebody thinks it sounds kind of you

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,000

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,200
a fact since age four i've been hearing

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
nat says anthony can you help me with

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
trigeminal neuralgia please been

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
following protocol for two months no

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
results yet so here's what happens now

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
with trigeminal neuralgia right i've

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,160
talked to a lot of doctors about this

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
that have come to me because they i know

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
doctors that deal with trigeminal

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,879
neuralgia and they in their cases lots

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,400
of cases and i've taught them a lot of

78
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
things and one thing that's critical to

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,160
know about trigeminal neuralgia

80
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
is that you can have the shingles virus

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,720
causing trigeminal neuralgia and you can

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
even have the simplex one fever blister

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,879
cold sore that you don't even see so you

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
don't even have the cold sore or fever

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
blister but it's in the nerves it's in

86
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
the cranial nerve so let's do this a

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
little bit because we're going to talk

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,599
about this now why do we get trigeminal

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,640
neuralgia

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,360
because of a low-grade viral infection a

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
low-grade viral infection and that

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
low-grade viral infection are these

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,239
little bugs right here that's the

94
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
low-grade viral infection right here

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
it's these bugs

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,800
and these bugs sit inside of us right

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,159
and so it takes time for some stubborn

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,239
stubborn trigeminal neuralgia cases take

99
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,519
time gotta make sure there's no gluten

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,440
there you gotta make sure there's no

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
eggs in there you gotta make sure

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
there's no dairy products you gotta make

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
sure that you're keeping the fats low

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,599
low you got to make sure and then

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
protocols what protocols are you on

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,959
right and that's important too

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
right

108
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,040
how far are you on the protocol what's

109
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
going on there if i had trigeminal

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
neuralgia i'd be doing the protocol and

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
i would be you know taking a look in

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,159
here and you'll see all the different

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
stuff with the protocol right here and

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
you make sure you're on your vitamin c

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
make sure you're on there b12 you make

116
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,959
sure you're on your your different

117
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
things that you need

118
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
zinc is critical too now ask your doctor

119
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
what's right for you but if i had

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
trigeminal neuralgia

121
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,799
i'd be

122
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
i'd be 100 fat free if it was bad if i

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,560
was suffering 100

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,280
no fats right

125
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
i'd be doing i'd be doing the papaya

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,840
banana mono cleanse possibly be doing

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
the heavy metal detox smoothie i'd have

128
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,000
that in there you know you can pick and

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
choose what you feel like doing but you

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
can get there one thing's for sure is

131
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
i'd stay away from the eggs the gluten

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
the dairy products if i had a

133
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
neurologist stay away from all of that

134
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
keep the fats down to zero if you can

135
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
and then get the antivirals in that are

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,320
in cleanse the heal right because you're

137
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,720
looking at knocking out that shingles

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,960
virus and that and the

139
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
simplex virus you're looking at knocking

140
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
those out so you can do a simplex

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
protocol you can be doing the shingles

142
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,560
protocol so that's the one you want and

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
cleanse the heal take it to your doctor

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
ask them what's right for you but the

145
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,360
shingles protocol so that's important

146
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,360
right there and and sometimes those you

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,880
know i'll tell you right now i've never

148
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
seen the needle move for trigeminal

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,840
neuralgia for anybody out there except

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
for medical medium protocols i've never

151
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
seen it move i mean i've talked to

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
hundreds of doctors for the last 35

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
years and trigeminal neuralgia is that

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
kind of thing that never budges unless

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
you do the right thing so there are

156
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,000
answers you got to stay with it you got

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
to you know learn how to chip away and

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
chip away until those viral that viral

159
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,479
inflammation is down and gone and when

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,479
it's gone all of a sudden you can chew

161
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
again oh my god i can chew again all of

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,160
a sudden you can start feeling better

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,080
what happens is

164
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
cranial nerves right here so cranial

165
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
nerves

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320
the trigeminal nerve right that's your

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,039
cranial nerve so trigeminal neuralgia is

168
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,199
about an inflamed cranial nerve cranial

169
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
nerves are why people are sick with so

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,320
many different things

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
and this is just one thing right there

172
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
so

173
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880

yeah you guys so let's talk a little bit

180
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
more about why we're sick just like

181
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
we're doing now and we'll keep on doing

182
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,319

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,000
struggling for a long time

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
you've been you've been trying to find

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
answers right

188
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,080
you want to know why you're sick and you

189
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
get answers and you get answers like

190
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
things like it's all in your gut or

191
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
something and that's not an answer i've

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
seen this so so many times with people

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,280
laurie says what causes a burning

194
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
sensation in the mouth when eating food

195
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,120
ebv or something else if i had a burning

196
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,800
sensation in my mouth okay

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
so if i had a burning sensation in my

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
mouth right

199
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
burning sensations i call it burning

200
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,840
tongue burning gums burning mouth right

201
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,080
that's that right there okay that's a

202
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,599
viral issue too so keep that in mind so

203
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
it's a viral issue when we go to the

204
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,120
doctors they don't know what burning

205
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
mouth burning tongue is they don't know

206
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
what burning cheeks are they don't know

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
what any of that is

208
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,400
and unless they're learning and they're

209
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,919
picking up medical medium information

210
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
because i've noticed that that that's

211
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,360
what's happening i noticed that the

212
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
clinics are taking mm info they've never

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,919
had

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
they're taking it right out of published

215
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
medical medium books and they're

216
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,880
starting to put it on their websites

217
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
like information that doesn't have a

218
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,280
study behind it but it came from

219
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,680
these books right so i noticed that

220
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,520
right now there's a big like thirst for

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
stealing information it's actually

222
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,599
hilarious but whatever

223
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,280
but what happens is when you go to the

224
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
best clinics and you tell them you've

225
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,560
got a burning tongue burning mouth

226
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,919
burning gums

227
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
and they'll just look at you like you're

228
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,720
crazy they won't know

229
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,440
they won't know that's also trigeminal

230
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,000
neuralgia and other cranial nerves that

231
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,919
cause the burning tongue burning face

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
you know burning face too burning face

233
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
