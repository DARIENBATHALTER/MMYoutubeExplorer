[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.68] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.28] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.68 - 20.00] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[18.28 - 22.52] you're listening to the medical medium
[20.00 - 25.00] radio show where each week I talk about
[22.52 - 27.12] the most advanced healing information
[25.00 - 30.20] and secrets about health much of which
[27.12 - 31.96] is not found anywhere else and is De
[30.20 - 34.24] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[31.96 - 37.40] always said who has 10 or 20 years to
[34.24 - 40.92] wait for answers to their illnesses life
[37.40 - 43.40] is precious and there's no time to spare
[40.92 - 46.24] let's get started now Today's Show is
[43.40 - 49.84] about gene mutation the
[46.24 - 52.64] mtfr gene mutation this is an important
[49.84 - 54.60] show it's going to be an historic show
[52.64 - 56.44] in many ways because what you're going
[54.60 - 59.96] to hear is
[56.44 - 63.44] mindblowing if you're a connoisseur of
[59.96 - 66.48] genes or gene mutations mtfr gene
[63.44 - 68.60] mutations and I'm not saying that it's
[66.48 - 71.24] going to be a show with information
[68.60 - 72.72] about genes and how they work and how
[71.24 - 75.16] they're they're connected to us it's not
[72.72 - 80.56] going to be there instead it's going to
[75.16 - 83.04] be protecting you against Gene fraud
[80.56 - 85.92] okay and that's something really it's
[83.04 - 88.24] critical to understand Gene fraud and
[85.92 - 90.92] what that means is things that are
[88.24 - 93.16] created so you think your body is
[90.92 - 95.32] destroying itself that your body is
[93.16 - 98.36] attacking itself that your genes are
[95.32 - 101.08] faulty that your genes are useless that
[98.36 - 104.12] your genes are attacking you or or
[101.08 - 107.08] melting down on you so that you don't
[104.12 - 109.40] have a chance to heal and that's the
[107.08 - 111.84] weakness that's thrown on us so if
[109.40 - 113.24] you're a gene expert you hang on to your
[111.84 - 116.52] seat you're either going to hate me
[113.24 - 118.72] after the show or or you're going to you
[116.52 - 119.96] know keep in one eye open and one ear
[118.72 - 122.40] open and you're going to be like hey you
[119.96 - 124.60] know what that makes sense because this
[122.40 - 126.48] is that important the show totally so
[124.60 - 128.56] that's that's what we're talking about
[126.48 - 130.76] today remember to go to my website

[236.84 - 240.80] heal and everything else so it's about
[238.72 - 243.40] you guys and that's the the key so
[240.80 - 245.08] anyway and hey look you know if if this
[243.40 - 248.20] the first time on the show it all
[245.08 - 250.28] started for me at age 4 when I heard a
[248.20 - 252.68] voice perfectly clear it led me to the
[250.28 - 256.76] diagnosis of my grandmother I've
[252.68 - 258.84] dedicated my entire life um to helping
[256.76 - 260.56] people tens of thousands of people get
[258.84 - 262.16] the answers they need so that's more
[260.56 - 263.80] about me I hear a voice that tells me
[262.16 - 265.56] what's going on and and we're going to
[263.80 - 267.68] go into the whole Gene thing right now
[265.56 - 270.16] so the so let's start so fasten your
[267.68 - 273.56] seat belt you know get ready
[270.16 - 277.28] fasten that seat belt hold on hold on to
[273.56 - 279.04] your seat because um this is a big deal
[277.28 - 282.40] today and maybe some of you don't even
[279.04 - 284.16] know about the gene mutation thing maybe
[282.40 - 286.16] you know you haven't heard it or or
[284.16 - 290.88] you're just done you're not aware of it
[286.16 - 293.16] or anything like that but the MTHFR gene
[290.88 - 297.72] mutation is taking the World by storm in
[293.16 - 300.12] holistic medicine at this point and if I
[297.72 - 302.72] go with the ride
[300.12 - 303.76] and just you know hop on that ride hop
[302.72 - 306.88] on that
[303.76 - 309.92] Trend um it's going to do you an
[306.88 - 312.52] injustice it really is you need to know
[309.92 - 315.96] this so I'm going to explain where I sit
[312.52 - 318.12] with this where it has its good place or
[315.96 - 321.40] it's good points and where it's
[318.12 - 323.64] completely backwards in a way that's not
[321.40 - 326.72] good at all for you your well-being for
[323.64 - 328.68] your children and for your family so
[326.72 - 331.32] this is really important to understand
[328.68 - 333.92] so see you know I'm not against every
[331.32 - 336.64] Trend in fad that's you know that's not
[333.92 - 339.36] it I mean look the celery juice Trend
[336.64 - 341.08] that started from me and everybody's
[339.36 - 343.08] doing now and it's going everywhere it's
[341.08 - 345.20] just it's it's crossing the Earth right
[343.08 - 346.88] now that's a trend that came from me
[345.20 - 349.44] okay so yeah I'm not going to be against
[346.88 - 352.44] the celery juice Trend because a you
[349.44 - 354.56] know Spirit created it but there and I'm
[352.44 - 357.32] not against other trends that are out
[354.56 - 359.52] there too that someone else came up with
[357.32 - 361.16] somehow or figured it out through Maybe
[359.52 - 363.28] a scientific thing that then became
[361.16 - 365.96] trendy I support a lot of different
[363.28 - 368.80] Trends too but there's some that there's
[365.96 - 371.88] there's no way it it deserves the
[368.80 - 373.40] support the support from me it doesn't
[371.88 - 375.04] one of the things that we got here is
[373.40 - 378.32] this gene mutation
[375.04 - 380.72] so what what is an Mt you know MTHFR
[378.32 - 383.72] gene mutation it's the inability to
[380.72 - 385.76] convert folate so that's the thing it's
[383.72 - 387.60] the inability to convert folate that's
[385.76 - 391.28] what you're going to hear out there so
[387.60 - 394.48] when you look into it you dial it up on
[391.28 - 396.12] your computer or you talk to a doctor or
[394.48 - 399.56] practitioner it's going to be this
[396.12 - 402.04] inability to convert fate or folic acid
[399.56 - 404.80] you know into usable forms into a form
[402.04 - 407.64] where the body can accept it and you
[404.80 - 408.96] know that part alone has some Merit to
[407.64 - 410.44] it but this I'm just going to give you
[408.96 - 413.68] what's out there now a little bit and
[410.44 - 415.80] you hey you could be an expert on this
[413.68 - 418.92] and you know have all these you know
[415.80 - 424.36] details that go along with all this but
[418.92 - 425.20] so basically the the MTHFR Gene produces
[424.36 - 428.52] an
[425.20 - 431.04] enzyme okay so methylene Tetra hydrolate
[428.52 - 433.12] that's the enzyme it produces so
[431.04 - 434.60] scientifically that's what's been
[433.12 - 437.40] discovered out there but I'm going to
[434.60 - 441.48] tell you right now about something about
[437.40 - 445.20] science okay science is
[441.48 - 446.88] incredible when it comes down to hey you
[445.20 - 448.48] break your leg I talked about that a
[446.88 - 450.56] zillion times you're probably like okay
[448.48 - 453.68] I've heard that before or you need a
[450.56 - 455.68] heart transplant okay or you need
[453.68 - 458.08] something else or your your gallbladder
[455.68 - 459.52] explodes because it got highly infected
[458.08 - 460.96] or stone got caught in there because
[459.52 - 462.76] you're doing a gallbladder flush and you
[460.96 - 465.04] flush the stone into the duct and now
[462.76 - 466.36] you need your your gallbladder removed
[465.04 - 468.28] hence is why I don't like the
[466.36 - 471.44] gallbladder flushes by the way you guys
[468.28 - 473.96] and so whatever it is that you know
[471.44 - 475.88] Sciences we have great surgeons got
[473.96 - 477.68] neurosurgeons you name it that can
[475.88 - 481.32] remove aneurysms out of people's brains
[477.68 - 482.64] with robots and and that's incredible
[481.32 - 483.92] that's the part of science that I love
[482.64 - 485.80] and there's there's plenty of it there's
[483.92 - 489.16] a decent amount of it but then there's
[485.80 - 491.68] chronic illness chronic illness massive
[489.16 - 494.20] you know amount of space out there
[491.68 - 496.96] complete mystery to science complete
[494.20 - 499.80] mystery and and you know for real
[496.96 - 503.00] mystery illness and anything you can tag
[499.80 - 505.20] a name onto it I don't care what it is
[503.00 - 507.88] tag a name onto it Celiac just so you
[505.20 - 509.68] know that's still a medical mystery um
[507.88 - 511.72] you know Hashimoto thyroiditis still a
[509.68 - 513.56] medical mystery until I brought the
[511.72 - 515.04] because I've been the first one to bring
[513.56 - 517.56] out the truth that the Epstein bar
[515.04 - 519.40] causes Hashim Modas and now people are
[517.56 - 521.40] picking that up now and they don't they
[519.40 - 523.84] don't say it came from me and whatever
[521.40 - 525.44] I'm seeing that out there out there and
[523.84 - 527.84] fine you know as long as the information
[525.44 - 532.04] gets out there it's incredible but the
[527.84 - 534.16] point is is that there are all these
[532.04 - 538.28] different chronic mystery illnesses with
[534.16 - 539.80] no real truth to what's going on behind
[538.28 - 542.36] any of them
[539.80 - 544.60] and and I mean the list goes on colius
[542.36 - 547.56] Myster illness that alone I mean you
[544.60 - 550.00] know uh depression depression depression
[547.56 - 552.32] is a mystery illness anxiety mystery
[550.00 - 554.08] illness I mean especially when it comes
[552.32 - 557.52] down to stuff like that and then you
[554.08 - 560.36] know ra um lupus multiple sclerosis
[557.52 - 563.48] still a mystery uh go on down the line
[560.36 - 566.68] ALS still a mystery and you know you can
[563.48 - 570.12] keep on going and keep on going so the
[566.68 - 571.88] point is is that since chronic illness
[570.12 - 573.52] is mystery illness and I dedicated the
[571.88 - 576.64] medical medium book The First Medical
[573.52 - 578.88] medium book to that um check that out if
[576.64 - 580.24] you haven't seen it go check a book out
[578.88 - 582.92] and and or pick one up or wherever you
[580.24 - 584.40] can get one and you know you'll see
[582.92 - 586.52] about how mystery and chronic illness
[584.40 - 588.48] and how it's designed how there's labels
[586.52 - 591.32] on things but technically the label
[588.48 - 593.40] really isn't the answer um how we need
[591.32 - 595.92] to deem these things mystery in order to
[593.40 - 597.68] get real help and they won't nobody
[595.92 - 599.20] won't the medical world won't medical
[597.68 - 602.16] communities won't deem any of these
[599.20 - 604.44] mystery illnesses because if they do
[602.16 - 607.52] that then they'll just be showcasing how
[604.44 - 609.28] they've been wrong the whole time um
[607.52 - 613.64] with just putting labels on things and
[609.28 - 616.00] that's it so and so where it falls in
[613.64 - 618.52] here's what I'm talking about now got
[616.00 - 621.72] all this chronic illness out there it's
[618.52 - 623.12] all mysterious it's not mysterious here
[621.72 - 624.60] it's not mysterious here and if you're
[623.12 - 626.68] someone who just logged on to the show
[624.60 - 627.72] and you don't know you don't know me or
[626.68 - 629.32] anything like that what's going on
[627.72 - 631.60] you're going to think oh so this guy has
[629.32 - 633.20] all the answers big Mr medical medium
[631.60 - 634.84] has all the answers here in this show
[633.20 - 637.52] but all the science and all the world
[634.84 - 639.88] doesn't have it it's not me that knows
[637.52 - 642.84] that it's a source that I've been given
[639.88 - 645.08] as a gift to receive whether you like it
[642.84 - 647.20] or not I've helped tens of thousands of
[645.08 - 649.56] people get to where they need to be
[647.20 - 651.68] regardless so you know putting this
[649.56 - 653.44] aside though putting this aside okay
[651.68 - 654.84] science doesn't have the answers to why
[653.44 - 656.56] mommies can't get out of bed and take
[654.84 - 658.12] care of their children to why people
[656.56 - 660.76] can't walk down the street because they
[658.12 - 662.60] got aches and pains but all these
[660.76 - 664.32] different things science does not cover
[662.60 - 666.40] any of that I don't care what anybody
[664.32 - 668.52] says I've seen the suffering I've seen
[666.40 - 671.80] what people have gone through I see it
[668.52 - 673.96] every day and things have to be done and
[671.80 - 676.96] we need real information from real
[673.96 - 679.00] sources so the whole point about The
[676.96 - 681.76] Chronic and mystery illness is because
[679.00 - 685.24] there's no answers we get blamed the
[681.76 - 687.04] blame game okay the blame game yes
[685.24 - 688.64] talking about it again I might have
[687.04 - 689.92] talked about it in the last show might
[688.64 - 692.00] have talked talked about a little bit in
[689.92 - 696.00] the last show before that but here's
[692.00 - 698.20] where it really kicks in really kicks in
[696.00 - 699.60] so when you get told you have an
[698.20 - 702.00] autoimmune
[699.60 - 703.60] disease you're told that your body is
[702.00 - 705.88] attacking itself you've heard this from
[703.60 - 707.92] me here's how it works we walk into the
[705.88 - 709.32] the doctor's office they don't know no
[707.92 - 711.08] one knows what's really wrong with
[709.32 - 713.12] anybody they don't know what's causing
[711.08 - 714.40] Hashimoto that's just a quick example
[713.12 - 716.64] because you know what so many people
[714.40 - 719.40] have thyroid problems and so it's it's
[716.64 - 722.08] easy to understand and we get hold their
[719.40 - 724.24] body is attacking itself the blame
[722.08 - 727.76] gamees going on okay this is one of the
[724.24 - 731.32] great mistakes I talk about but there's
[727.76 - 735.20] blame another blame game and it's a bad
[731.32 - 738.36] one it's really bad it's the genan blame
[735.20 - 741.68] game it's a losers game everybody walks
[738.36 - 743.32] away a loser on this one it's no fun
[741.68 - 746.72] it's it's
[743.32 - 747.60] insulting insulting terribly insulting
[746.72 - 750.72] it's
[747.60 - 755.24] demeaning it's the gening because of
[750.72 - 757.60] jees you name it it is what it is and
[755.24 - 759.52] what the what I'm trying to say is you
[757.60 - 762.20] got something wrong with you and you got
[759.52 - 764.36] some bad jeans you got some rotten jeans
[762.20 - 766.92] you got some faulty jeans your jeans
[764.36 - 769.04] don't work that's your problem you're
[766.92 - 770.88] sick because you got bad jeans over
[769.04 - 773.36] there that person over there is healthy
[770.88 - 775.52] cuz they got good jeans you got bad
[773.36 - 778.28] jeans cuz you feel like
[775.52 - 780.44] crap okay that person's overweight oh
[778.28 - 782.08] they got bad genes that person you know
[780.44 - 784.72] has all kinds of problems they got bad
[782.08 - 786.84] genes that's where it's going because it
[784.72 - 788.16] has to go there because medical research
[786.84 - 789.72] and medical science whether anybody
[788.16 - 792.04] likes it or not I'm just going to tell
[789.72 - 794.92] you right now doesn't have the answers
[792.04 - 796.48] it doesn't have the
[794.92 - 800.84] answers
[796.48 - 801.80] 90% of Health and Wellness is mysterious
[800.84 - 805.56] it's
[801.80 - 807.92] mystery that's the bottom line and where
[805.56 - 809.76] the gene mutation comes in this is where
[807.92 - 812.44] you got to be careful you get sucked
[809.76 - 815.40] into the G mutation you're going to get
[812.44 - 818.56] in trouble big trouble because you're
[815.40 - 821.48] going to lose you got to be careful and
[818.56 - 823.72] I'm saying that now now it's pretty bold
[821.48 - 827.52] to go against a trend that's catching on
[823.72 - 830.16] like lightning out there lightning it's
[827.52 - 833.48] it's so so yeah so I'm being pretty bold
[830.16 - 836.80] about this but I'm going to put my butt
[833.48 - 839.36] on the firing line to do everything I
[836.80 - 842.28] can to protect you your children and
[839.36 - 843.92] your well-being that's the bottom line
[842.28 - 846.16] and what you're going to hear is going
[843.92 - 847.96] to make sense it's going to make a lot
[846.16 - 849.96] of sense is what you're going to hear as
[847.96 - 852.44] we go through this show this is a very
[849.96 - 856.12] important show just as important as the
[852.44 - 858.36] lime disease show just as important as
[856.12 - 862.32] you know as as other shows that have
[858.36 - 865.04] done and maybe even more important okay
[862.32 - 867.96] um so let's let's run into it a little
[865.04 - 872.00] bit so science is telling us is
[867.96 - 873.00] dictating to us right now that our genes
[872.00 - 876.84] become
[873.00 - 877.68] mutated and they can't produce enzymes
[876.84 - 880.92] that are
[877.68 - 882.52] needed and these enzymes help you know
[880.92 - 886.12] with glutathion production they help
[882.52 - 887.68] with folate and folic acid um
[886.12 - 890.52] involvement as far as easily
[887.68 - 893.40] assimilating into the body and and it
[890.52 - 895.20] involves chemical compounds as well so
[893.40 - 896.84] we're told that if you have the gene
[895.20 - 898.08] mutation whatever variety of gene
[896.84 - 900.96] mutation you might have there's
[898.08 - 902.80] different m th hfrg mutations now there
[900.96 - 904.88] was used to be just one now there's two
[902.80 - 907.40] now there's three and I'm sure there'll
[904.88 - 909.20] be 10 more because you know why science
[907.40 - 912.60] doesn't know what it's doing in this
[909.20 - 915.12] it's just it it's just moving in a in a
[912.60 - 917.00] path that's not a good place now good
[915.12 - 919.76] meaning practitioners and
[917.00 - 922.00] doctors is they're you know they're for
[919.76 - 923.32] you they're for you they're looking out
[922.00 - 924.84] for you they're looking after you they
[923.32 - 927.32] care about you just like I care about
[924.84 - 929.56] you I'm sure they do you know that's the
[927.32 - 932.52] whole point we go into this because we
[929.56 - 935.96] care and that's what it's about but it's
[932.52 - 939.04] easy for a practitioner to get LED down
[935.96 - 942.24] this path of genes because it makes so
[939.04 - 945.56] much sense that that much must be what's
[942.24 - 948.76] behind you being sick and and whoever's
[945.56 - 950.64] sick it's behind it so it's easy to go
[948.76 - 953.52] right down that
[950.64 - 955.96] path and and and head there and be like
[953.52 - 957.44] okay yeah jeans heck yeah why not we're
[955.96 - 959.44] made up of jeans look at all the
[957.44 - 963.88] hereditary traits we have
[959.44 - 966.32] but the genan blame game is a tricky one
[963.88 - 968.48] it's the trickiest of all because when
[966.32 - 970.72] you have a child and your child takes on
[968.48 - 973.96] hereditary traits you can't ignore the
[970.72 - 976.24] fact that genes are not playing a role
[973.96 - 977.88] when you have some similarities to your
[976.24 - 981.36] forefather to your mother your father to
[977.88 - 984.12] your grandfather it wins the case
[981.36 - 988.00] immediately that jeans have to be while
[984.12 - 990.12] you're sick it wins the Case Case Closed
[988.00 - 993.04] bam
[990.12 - 996.48] because you get it it's
[993.04 - 999.96] inescapable you can't get away from the
[996.48 - 1003.16] fact that your mother or your father or
[999.96 - 1006.80] your grandfather looks the same or maybe
[1003.16 - 1010.52] even feels the same or maybe even has a
[1006.80 - 1014.72] symptom that's the same regardless it's
[1010.52 - 1018.92] it's impossible to ignore so this is by
[1014.72 - 1022.36] far one of the most evil miscon
[1018.92 - 1024.48] inceptions there has to be because no
[1022.36 - 1028.16] matter what and no matter probably what
[1024.48 - 1029.12] I say here it's just easy to fall into
[1028.16 - 1031.88] this
[1029.12 - 1034.12] pit what this means is generations to
[1031.88 - 1035.56] come are going to all think no matter
[1034.12 - 1037.36] what their chronic illnesses are Gene
[1035.56 - 1038.88] related and that medical research and
[1037.36 - 1040.92] medical science better be up on the
[1038.88 - 1043.64] genes and better be working to help our
[1040.92 - 1045.80] genes and money and billions of dollars
[1043.64 - 1048.52] has to go into genan Jean genan Jean
[1045.80 - 1049.96] genes yep that's right and guess what
[1048.52 - 1052.64] people are not only going to be sick
[1049.96 - 1056.20] they're going to be sicker in the future
[1052.64 - 1060.60] and that's why this is by far one of the
[1056.20 - 1062.44] worst so the point is how do we escape
[1060.60 - 1064.72] this and what do we do okay we're filled
[1062.44 - 1066.28] with genes they have their purposes
[1064.72 - 1068.60] absolutely they have their purpose they
[1066.28 - 1069.84] do genes are involved in our body in so
[1068.60 - 1071.76] many different
[1069.84 - 1074.12] ways but your
[1071.76 - 1079.40] Gene can't become
[1074.12 - 1082.60] mutated it can't become mutated
[1079.40 - 1085.88] it's not truly a real mutation if you've
[1082.60 - 1091.92] been diagnosed with an mthf FRG mutation
[1085.88 - 1095.40] it's technically not a real gene
[1091.92 - 1098.04] mutation even if the gene is
[1095.40 - 1102.56] under problems of some kind meaning
[1098.04 - 1105.56] under some kind of um contaminant some
[1102.56 - 1108.72] kind of chemical some kind of pollutants
[1105.56 - 1113.00] creating a gene to not function function
[1108.72 - 1114.24] is good it's not technically mutated so
[1113.00 - 1117.24] you need to understand this so when you
[1114.24 - 1118.60] get diagnosed with MTHFR gene mutation
[1117.24 - 1120.44] it's not you don't have a gene you don't
[1118.60 - 1122.36] have a gene that's mutated you don't you
[1120.44 - 1126.04] don't have a gene that's not working in
[1122.36 - 1130.12] fact when it comes down to mfrg mutation
[1126.04 - 1132.44] the gene isn't even
[1130.12 - 1136.92] problematic there's something else
[1132.44 - 1141.24] triggering off the faulty MTHFR gene
[1136.92 - 1144.00] mutation test tests the faulty
[1141.24 - 1147.36] tests that's what's going on there the
[1144.00 - 1150.64] mthf FRG mutation tests are not accurate
[1147.36 - 1152.28] they're inaccurate to begin with okay so
[1150.64 - 1154.60] that's what's going on there doesn't
[1152.28 - 1156.32] mean you don't have to you doesn't mean
[1154.60 - 1158.36] you don't stop and get one I mean you
[1156.32 - 1161.36] can still get your G mutation test the
[1158.36 - 1162.64] whole bit but I'm trying to let you know
[1161.36 - 1166.00] they're not
[1162.64 - 1168.84] Ironclad not Ironclad at all and if you
[1166.00 - 1170.88] do ring up a gene mutation test gets
[1168.84 - 1173.04] rung up positive I'm going to tell you
[1170.88 - 1177.28] what's going on so we can really cut
[1173.04 - 1180.56] into it so we have methylation problems
[1177.28 - 1183.80] that's the real part we have inabilities
[1180.56 - 1185.48] inability to methylate methylate is
[1183.80 - 1187.84] conversion it's all about conversion
[1185.48 - 1191.64] inside the body that's what methylation
[1187.84 - 1194.40] is it's all about conversion uh breaking
[1191.64 - 1196.56] down chemicals into smaller chemicals
[1194.40 - 1198.72] breaking down smaller chemicals into
[1196.56 - 1201.84] smaller chemicals breaking down those
[1198.72 - 1204.60] smaller chemicals into smaller chemicals
[1201.84 - 1206.96] it goes on and on and on if you look
[1204.60 - 1209.20] into methylation or you look into the G
[1206.96 - 1211.28] mutation out there on the trendy stuff
[1209.20 - 1213.16] that's trending they'll just kind of you
[1211.28 - 1214.88] know cut it clear they'll say well you
[1213.16 - 1217.88] know it's an enzyme and then they'll say
[1214.88 - 1219.88] you know this enzyme um you know um this
[1217.88 - 1222.72] enzyme is involved with methylene
[1219.88 - 1224.16] another enzyme and that they bind on
[1222.72 - 1226.16] together they break down folate they
[1224.16 - 1228.84] break down folic acid and it it's pretty
[1226.16 - 1231.16] much where it stops but
[1228.84 - 1233.76] what's really happening is we have
[1231.16 - 1235.84] chemical breakdowns in the body that
[1233.76 - 1238.52] science is so far away that it would
[1235.84 - 1241.24] take a thousand years we're talking
[1238.52 - 1243.76] about it doesn't stop at chemicals
[1241.24 - 1246.00] breaking down and converting into more a
[1243.76 - 1249.32] smaller chemicals or more easily viable
[1246.00 - 1251.72] chemicals it keeps on going the mystery
[1249.32 - 1254.36] of what our body does how many chemicals
[1251.72 - 1256.96] we have is is unbelievable and I'm going
[1254.36 - 1259.96] to talk about something here something
[1256.96 - 1264.96] very important okay okay medical science
[1259.96 - 1269.44] and research only believes the liver is
[1264.96 - 1272.44] responsible for anywhere from 400 to 500
[1269.44 - 1274.08] chemical uses or chemical
[1272.44 - 1276.48] responsibilities okay chemical
[1274.08 - 1278.40] responsibilities in your body to do
[1276.48 - 1281.76] things to do things to keep you alive
[1278.40 - 1283.04] and well the liver has thousands of
[1281.76 - 1285.44] chemical
[1283.04 - 1288.24] responsibilities thousands that haven't
[1285.44 - 1291.16] even been discovered yet and these
[1288.24 - 1294.16] thousands of responsibilities play into
[1291.16 - 1296.60] methylation which is still in its baby
[1294.16 - 1298.64] stage of understanding but the problem
[1296.60 - 1301.84] is it sends you down the direction that
[1298.64 - 1304.72] your Gene is mutated and that's the
[1301.84 - 1307.28] problem the problem with that is the
[1304.72 - 1311.08] real issue in your health is not being
[1307.28 - 1312.72] seen whatsoever not being seen not being
[1311.08 - 1314.40] understood but then you might get a
[1312.72 - 1317.28] diagnosed well you got this methylation
[1314.40 - 1320.48] issue this MTHFR gen mutation issue you
[1317.28 - 1323.48] got that you're me not methylating fine
[1320.48 - 1324.92] and and you know youve got some candida
[1323.48 - 1326.44] you may have this oh you've been
[1324.92 - 1329.64] diagnosed with lime you got a little bit
[1326.44 - 1331.96] borderline lime it's a mess it's a hot
[1329.64 - 1335.44] mess out there so let's talk about how
[1331.96 - 1337.60] it works what what creates the test the
[1335.44 - 1341.28] triggers off the test to begin with what
[1337.60 - 1346.00] triggers it off is inflammation the
[1341.28 - 1350.40] MTHFR G mutation test is just as good as
[1346.00 - 1353.56] an Ana anti- nuclear antibody test just
[1350.40 - 1355.80] as good as that test it's just as good
[1353.56 - 1360.60] as a C-reactive protein test they're
[1355.80 - 1363.84] just basic inflammatory marker tests but
[1360.60 - 1369.36] the mthf FRG mutation test is under the
[1363.84 - 1372.08] guce of a gene test it's just another
[1369.36 - 1374.56] basic you got some inflammation
[1372.08 - 1378.28] throughout your entire
[1374.56 - 1382.12] body test that's what it is just just so
[1378.28 - 1383.04] you know so where does this lead this
[1382.12 - 1384.56] leads
[1383.04 - 1387.36] to
[1384.56 - 1390.20] misdiagnosis this leads to
[1387.36 - 1392.08] misinformation less information for our
[1390.20 - 1394.44] health and well-being kind of like the
[1392.08 - 1397.84] anti-nuclear antigen test antibody test
[1394.44 - 1401.20] the Ana test that test for
[1397.84 - 1403.12] Lupus tells you if you have Lupus first
[1401.20 - 1405.40] of all it doesn't tell you if you have
[1403.12 - 1409.16] Lupus it's just another inflammation
[1405.40 - 1412.52] test for mystery illness or mystery
[1409.16 - 1415.52] issues the mthf FRG mutation test should
[1412.52 - 1417.36] just be a tool to show that yes there's
[1415.52 - 1420.52] something else wrong with you or going
[1417.36 - 1423.40] on with you but it should not be
[1420.52 - 1425.52] deciphering or defining you and saying
[1423.40 - 1427.28] that you have a gene mutation or that
[1425.52 - 1430.64] your child has a gene
[1427.28 - 1433.40] mutation it's so detrimental to your
[1430.64 - 1435.76] health and well-being you have to back
[1433.40 - 1439.12] out of that and say okay you know what I
[1435.76 - 1442.16] don't have a gene mutation it's not
[1439.12 - 1443.84] possible what I have though is a marker
[1442.16 - 1446.08] that's telling me something else is
[1443.84 - 1448.68] going on and that's the part where I'm
[1446.08 - 1452.04] okay about the test itself because the
[1448.68 - 1453.92] test is a basic inflammatory test just
[1452.04 - 1457.56] like many of the other ones that get a
[1453.92 - 1460.16] tag and get a label so if you do or you
[1457.56 - 1462.56] have been diagnosed with MTHFR gene
[1460.16 - 1466.08] mutation one of the gene mutations and
[1462.56 - 1468.32] you have been diagnosed and you have
[1466.08 - 1470.12] that test has been done and you've been
[1468.32 - 1473.16] told this is what's going on what you
[1470.12 - 1475.56] have to do is it's okay it's okay you
[1473.16 - 1477.92] just have to know your Gene's not
[1475.56 - 1480.08] mutated you have to know that
[1477.92 - 1482.76] immediately you don't have a gene
[1480.08 - 1485.12] dysfunction but you have to realize the
[1482.76 - 1488.00] test is not really accurate it's in its
[1485.12 - 1490.64] baby stages I mean that you give it 20
[1488.00 - 1492.40] years and you watch where that test is
[1490.64 - 1494.48] and you have to realize it's just a
[1492.40 - 1497.44] marker that's showing that you have
[1494.48 - 1498.80] something else going on so that's how
[1497.44 - 1501.88] you have have to see it and this is
[1498.80 - 1505.12] where I'm supportive of the gene
[1501.88 - 1507.56] mutation test it really they should just
[1505.12 - 1509.56] change the name of it they should change
[1507.56 - 1513.80] the name of it and get out of the whole
[1509.56 - 1516.52] Gene blame game it's a dangerous game so
[1513.80 - 1517.72] here's the deal you go to the doctor
[1516.52 - 1519.28] you're not feeling good whether you're
[1517.72 - 1520.52] not feeling good or not people get the
[1519.28 - 1522.88] test and it rings off and they're
[1520.52 - 1524.88] feeling fine but you go to the doctor
[1522.88 - 1527.28] you get the test or your
[1524.88 - 1530.80] practitioner test comes up positive that
[1527.28 - 1532.60] you got the MTHFR gene mutation okay
[1530.80 - 1534.52] what you have to realize right away
[1532.60 - 1536.88] something else is going on there's
[1534.52 - 1538.48] something happening inside the body and
[1536.88 - 1541.44] let me tell you what's happening and
[1538.48 - 1544.76] where it is all gene
[1541.44 - 1546.08] mutations meaning the test itself
[1544.76 - 1548.80] providing somebody with the
[1546.08 - 1551.88] misinformation of having a gene
[1548.80 - 1554.96] mutation all these lead to a
[1551.88 - 1557.72] dysfunctional problem in the liver
[1554.96 - 1559.84] that's where it's all going on it's the
[1557.72 - 1564.72] liver second part is the intestinal
[1559.84 - 1568.32] tract but the liver is where the trouble
[1564.72 - 1571.16] lies see what triggers off the
[1568.32 - 1574.28] inflammation that then determines if you
[1571.16 - 1578.28] have an mthf FRG mutation what triggers
[1574.28 - 1582.40] all of this off is byproduct byproduct
[1578.28 - 1585.44] coming out of the liver floating in the
[1582.40 - 1588.60] bloodstream wreaking havoc causing
[1585.44 - 1592.64] homocysteine levels to rise or to fall
[1588.60 - 1594.96] or become useless it's it's these these
[1592.64 - 1597.12] other chemicals these toxins they're
[1594.96 - 1601.56] floating around the bloodstream from the
[1597.12 - 1604.88] liver from sources in combinations of
[1601.56 - 1607.88] pathogens viruses inside the liver
[1604.88 - 1611.76] viruses or heavy metals or both
[1607.88 - 1615.56] technically it really is both most cases
[1611.76 - 1618.76] of having heavy metals inside the liver
[1615.56 - 1621.56] having a lot of byproduct a lot of slug
[1618.76 - 1623.40] sludge a lot of Gunk a lot of junk
[1621.56 - 1627.12] inside that
[1623.40 - 1629.16] liver from pathogens that are producing
[1627.12 - 1630.72] that also things that the liver have
[1629.16 - 1635.40] collected over the years like the toxic
[1630.72 - 1639.24] heavy metals and that junk and garbage
[1635.40 - 1641.84] starts making the liver less efficient
[1639.24 - 1645.16] stops letting it function as good stops
[1641.84 - 1648.88] it from cleaning your blood when you get
[1645.16 - 1652.28] your F Mt mthf R gene mutation test and
[1648.88 - 1654.28] it comes up positive you got dirty blood
[1652.28 - 1656.88] that's what it means it doesn't mean you
[1654.28 - 1659.84] have a faulty Gene it means you have a
[1656.88 - 1665.96] you have dirty blood it means your dirty
[1659.84 - 1669.28] blood is preventing folate or folic acid
[1665.96 - 1672.72] from converting methylating being usable
[1669.28 - 1675.44] by the body so here's where the parts
[1672.72 - 1678.72] more than true there's a methylation
[1675.44 - 1681.68] issue correct I'm not against the
[1678.72 - 1684.76] methylation issue I've been talking
[1681.68 - 1689.24] about methylation for 30
[1684.76 - 1692.32] years so that's how long it's been and
[1689.24 - 1694.48] so I'm totally for it because that's
[1692.32 - 1697.44] where it lies that's where the truth
[1694.48 - 1698.68] holds it holds in there it's not that
[1697.44 - 1702.20] you have a g
[1698.68 - 1706.16] mutation but you do have a methylation
[1702.20 - 1708.12] problem so what the practitioner and the
[1706.16 - 1712.04] doctor is discovering is you do have a
[1708.12 - 1714.56] methylation problem but it's under the G
[1712.04 - 1718.36] it's under the hidden
[1714.56 - 1720.48] roof you know that dark pit of it's your
[1718.36 - 1724.20] Gene causing all this
[1720.48 - 1726.76] trouble and guess what if your Gene's
[1724.20 - 1729.72] causing all the trouble you can't fix
[1726.76 - 1731.52] that you can't just fix that Gene if
[1729.72 - 1734.00] your Gene's causing all the
[1731.52 - 1736.32] trouble but here's the irony you fix
[1734.00 - 1739.36] somebody's methylation problem and the
[1736.32 - 1741.08] test doesn't ring off off anymore so
[1739.36 - 1743.80] when you fix somebody's methylation
[1741.08 - 1745.56] issue where they're methylating their
[1743.80 - 1749.20] liver is getting better their blood
[1745.56 - 1753.12] isn't dirty they don't trigger off the
[1749.20 - 1756.64] gene mutation test anymore isn't that
[1753.12 - 1758.48] interesting one week that test rings off
[1756.64 - 1761.00] that you got the you got two two
[1758.48 - 1764.00] versions of G mutations one one week
[1761.00 - 1766.48] that test rings off that you're it shows
[1764.00 - 1768.44] you got this mthf FRG mutation and it's
[1766.48 - 1770.48] really bad
[1768.44 - 1773.60] and then you start methylating
[1770.48 - 1775.52] again and you start fixing the problem
[1773.60 - 1778.04] that's creating the dirty
[1775.52 - 1782.52] blood and that's inside the
[1778.04 - 1784.32] liver and guess what that test goes away
[1782.52 - 1787.44] the Tex test goes away I know
[1784.32 - 1790.52] practitioners that are baffled because
[1787.44 - 1792.48] because the person did the right thing
[1790.52 - 1794.80] not offered by the practitioner but did
[1792.48 - 1797.44] the right thing by finding and sourcing
[1794.80 - 1799.64] the right information to to heal a meth
[1797.44 - 1801.68] a problem like the adino silab balamin
[1799.64 - 1804.56] we talk about like the B12 we talk about
[1801.68 - 1806.40] you guys and really creating the you
[1804.56 - 1808.84] know creating methylation in the body
[1806.40 - 1812.28] cleaning up the liver getting the viral
[1808.84 - 1813.56] load down and then the test goes away
[1812.28 - 1815.00] and then literally the practitioner
[1813.56 - 1817.76] scratching the head like this is
[1815.00 - 1819.44] impossible this you know maybe the blood
[1817.76 - 1821.40] was switched to the lab maybe the blood
[1819.44 - 1823.92] was switched here maybe you know they
[1821.40 - 1826.60] can't understand how it's possible you
[1823.92 - 1829.68] lose the tag the label it's possible
[1826.60 - 1832.88] because once you fix the real issue you
[1829.68 - 1835.28] lose that inflammation the inflammation
[1832.88 - 1836.88] disappears and it won't trigger off the
[1835.28 - 1840.08] gene mutation
[1836.88 - 1842.44] test so just recap a little bit gene
[1840.08 - 1844.44] mutation test number one is really just
[1842.44 - 1845.48] an inflammatory test with a fancy name
[1844.44 - 1848.12] blaming your
[1845.48 - 1849.20] jeans I'm just being straightforward now
[1848.12 - 1850.88] if you're a practitioner you're like
[1849.20 - 1853.16] that's not true I know how the test
[1850.88 - 1856.04] works it's a real Gene we're looking at
[1853.16 - 1857.52] no no no no no no yeah that part yeah
[1856.04 - 1861.36] you're looking at that you're looking at
[1857.52 - 1864.08] a real Gene but the test still comes up
[1861.36 - 1866.88] wrong it's how look you can name you can
[1864.08 - 1871.44] take any test and name it anything you
[1866.88 - 1874.12] want in any way capacity possible but
[1871.44 - 1877.36] it's going to end up being in many cases
[1874.12 - 1880.44] an inflammatory test and this is a new
[1877.36 - 1884.20] version of showcasing inflammation in
[1880.44 - 1886.20] the body yeah rocking the B rocking the
[1884.20 - 1887.96] you know rocking the boat when it comes
[1886.20 - 1890.60] down to homosysteine
[1887.96 - 1893.28] and rocking the boat in
[1890.60 - 1895.56] methylation but nevertheless it's an
[1893.28 - 1896.84] inflammatory marker that's what it is
[1895.56 - 1898.44] just like I've talked about all the Lyme
[1896.84 - 1901.20] disease tests all these years why do you
[1898.44 - 1903.36] think Lyme disease testing is oh your
[1901.20 - 1905.28] borderline it's either you have the
[1903.36 - 1907.92] pathogen or you don't but for some
[1905.28 - 1909.32] reason we're told oh but it's borderline
[1907.92 - 1911.20] so yeah we would say you do because it's
[1909.32 - 1913.60] borderline what's borderline you either
[1911.20 - 1915.68] you either have it or you don't the
[1913.60 - 1918.36] reason why it's borderline because it's
[1915.68 - 1920.16] an inflammation test another version of
[1918.36 - 1922.40] an inflammation test you listen to the
[1920.16 - 1925.24] lime show you I think I talk about it
[1922.40 - 1926.88] there and uh and I'll do another another
[1925.24 - 1929.52] lime show in the future what you're
[1926.88 - 1932.00] going to find anybody who's viral and I
[1929.52 - 1933.52] talked about this Lyme disease is viral
[1932.00 - 1935.28] the reason why I'm mentioning this it's
[1933.52 - 1937.72] important to know Lyme disease is viral
[1935.28 - 1939.72] not bacterial at read if this is the
[1937.72 - 1941.52] first time hopping on the show you know
[1939.72 - 1944.04] hopping into the show read the book
[1941.52 - 1946.52] medical medium read the lime chapter but
[1944.04 - 1949.12] same thing with ra it's viral same thing
[1946.52 - 1951.52] with multiple sclerosis that's viral you
[1949.12 - 1953.48] can go on and on and on and all these
[1951.52 - 1956.04] different illnesses that we have there's
[1953.48 - 1958.52] probably hundred I can name maybe even
[1956.04 - 1960.88] 200 but it would just drive you nuts if
[1958.52 - 1963.84] I sat here naming a list of 200
[1960.88 - 1967.00] illnesses in these 200
[1963.84 - 1970.08] illnesses understand that viruses play a
[1967.00 - 1974.24] role and those
[1970.08 - 1976.08] viruses sit inside the liver muck it up
[1974.24 - 1979.48] whether you feel good or you don't feel
[1976.08 - 1981.52] good releasing poison and toxin or
[1979.48 - 1983.68] filling up toxins in the liver so when
[1981.52 - 1985.36] you're diagnosed with Lyme disease
[1983.68 - 1988.12] you're going to have an mthf FRG
[1985.36 - 1991.68] mutation everybody with lime now is
[1988.12 - 1993.00] getting the Mt MTHFR G mutation test now
[1991.68 - 1997.40] and they're all coming up positive
[1993.00 - 2000.08] because it's viral issues in the liver
[1997.40 - 2005.68] causing dirty blood and triggering off
[2000.08 - 2007.68] the mtfr gene mutation test so that you
[2005.68 - 2010.24] get diagnosed with a G
[2007.68 - 2011.64] issue anybody with multiple sclerosis
[2010.24 - 2013.68] now they're getting they're they're
[2011.64 - 2018.04] saying they they got the mthf FRG
[2013.68 - 2021.44] mutation everybody with lupus MTHFR G
[2018.04 - 2023.00] mutation see what's happening here is
[2021.44 - 2024.88] when you have a viral condition that's
[2023.00 - 2026.36] causing lupus like the Epstein bar virus
[2024.88 - 2028.68] that causes lupus they talk about it in
[2026.36 - 2030.12] the book or you got you know or you got
[2028.68 - 2032.80] the multiple sclerosis or a different
[2030.12 - 2035.36] variet variety of Epstein bar causing Ms
[2032.80 - 2039.16] whatever it is or Lyme disease where
[2035.36 - 2040.96] it's hhv6 HH B7 or shingles or the
[2039.16 - 2042.52] Epstein bar varieties or multiple
[2040.96 - 2045.08] varieties of all these creating Lyme
[2042.52 - 2047.96] disease whatever it is you're going to
[2045.08 - 2049.00] see mthf FRG mutation eventually come up
[2047.96 - 2052.36] and you're going to see methylation
[2049.00 - 2055.96] issues the methylation issues homo homoy
[2052.36 - 2061.08] issues are because the liver gets
[2055.96 - 2065.04] clogged up clouded up filled the toxins
[2061.08 - 2068.16] from having to deal with viral issues
[2065.04 - 2072.16] and this flood of toxins viral viral
[2068.16 - 2074.60] bodies viral casings spets that actually
[2072.16 - 2078.20] are viral because casings of viruses
[2074.60 - 2081.52] look like spyit you name it all of this
[2078.20 - 2084.56] stuff dumps into the bloodstream along
[2081.52 - 2087.08] with neurotoxins Dermot toxins that go
[2084.56 - 2089.84] to the skin and create eczema psoriasis
[2087.08 - 2090.88] all of this dumps into the bloodstream
[2089.84 - 2093.76] floats
[2090.88 - 2095.24] around and triggers off the MTHFR gene
[2093.76 - 2096.68] mutation test and then you're told you
[2095.24 - 2098.16] have a mutated Gene which doesn't help
[2096.68 - 2099.76] you you heal from Lyme disease it
[2098.16 - 2101.60] doesn't help you heal from Ms it doesn't
[2099.76 - 2103.40] help you heal from eximus risis it
[2101.60 - 2106.08] doesn't help you heal from SAR cardosis
[2103.40 - 2108.64] it doesn't help you heal from you know
[2106.08 - 2113.40] uh colitis or whatever it is it doesn't
[2108.64 - 2116.72] help you heal to think and that you have
[2113.40 - 2120.16] a gene mutation and if you think that
[2116.72 - 2122.68] that's not true you're wrong it sits in
[2120.16 - 2126.28] the back of the Mind in a subconscious
[2122.68 - 2129.40] place that your jeans suck and it eats
[2126.28 - 2131.28] away at the immune system so you got to
[2129.40 - 2132.72] flip the switch now you got to know that
[2131.28 - 2135.64] you have no gene
[2132.72 - 2138.44] mutation you got to flip it and know you
[2135.64 - 2141.04] don't have a gene mutation but what you
[2138.44 - 2143.60] have is a methylation problem and that's
[2141.04 - 2145.28] where the gene mutation test or the
[2143.60 - 2148.28] philosophy or the theory because it's
[2145.28 - 2151.16] all theoretical just so you know it's
[2148.28 - 2152.92] all you know just know that there is
[2151.16 - 2155.96] though a methylation issue cuz when that
[2152.92 - 2158.96] liver gets clogged up and it gets dirty
[2155.96 - 2160.72] and the blood gets get dirty and all
[2158.96 - 2162.84] that's going on and stuff's flooding
[2160.72 - 2165.24] into the bloodstream and into the
[2162.84 - 2167.20] intestinal tract and clouding it up and
[2165.24 - 2169.16] you're not eating the right foods and
[2167.20 - 2171.28] that's elevating more inflammation and
[2169.16 - 2174.56] feeding more pathogens and whatever's
[2171.28 - 2176.88] going on just know methylation is not
[2174.56 - 2181.12] going to go good you're going to get
[2176.88 - 2184.84] minimum methylation minimum
[2181.12 - 2187.40] conversions minimum conversions of
[2184.84 - 2189.40] important chemicals and chemical
[2187.40 - 2192.92] compounds and phytochemicals that come
[2189.40 - 2195.96] through from food and come from all the
[2192.92 - 2199.64] things that we involve come from the Sun
[2195.96 - 2202.36] it come from food Sun clean
[2199.64 - 2204.92] water and we're going to we're not going
[2202.36 - 2207.72] to get the methylation
[2204.92 - 2210.56] needed and there's this little spot I
[2207.72 - 2214.04] talk about a lot it's in the colon It's
[2210.56 - 2216.80] the eloel the Elum it's right there in
[2214.04 - 2218.40] the Elum it's a little spot right right
[2216.80 - 2221.96] after your small intestinal track and
[2218.40 - 2224.92] right before your colon that spot has
[2221.96 - 2226.76] probiotics called elevated biotics from
[2224.92 - 2228.88] when you eat an apple you picked off a
[2226.76 - 2230.48] tree not an apple you just get in the
[2228.88 - 2233.12] supermarket that's been sitting there
[2230.48 - 2234.84] waxed I'm talking about when you when
[2233.12 - 2236.28] you that one time in your life you went
[2234.84 - 2237.76] to an apple orchard because you went to
[2236.28 - 2240.76] go pick some apples and drink a little
[2237.76 - 2243.52] fresh apple cider that has these
[2240.76 - 2245.72] elevated biotics in it it's a
[2243.52 - 2248.04] microorganism that helps you methylate
[2245.72 - 2250.64] that produces B12 when you pick a little
[2248.04 - 2252.88] piece of kale out of the
[2250.64 - 2255.44] garden that
[2252.88 - 2258.16] produces B12 because it has
[2255.44 - 2260.52] microorganisms that get to the Elum this
[2258.16 - 2261.88] little section after your in small
[2260.52 - 2265.48] intestinal
[2261.88 - 2267.64] tract so methylation is a big deal we
[2265.48 - 2270.20] got to clean up the liver we have to get
[2267.64 - 2272.52] the diet right we have to lower any kind
[2270.20 - 2275.76] of viral issues if you have a gene
[2272.52 - 2277.36] mutation test that comes back positive
[2275.76 - 2280.72] and your doctor says you're not
[2277.36 - 2282.48] methylating then you better go antiviral
[2280.72 - 2284.52] and talk to your doctor tell your
[2282.48 - 2285.96] practitioner say look that means you
[2284.52 - 2288.16] know I heard from Anthony that means
[2285.96 - 2289.72] that I got low levels of viral issue
[2288.16 - 2292.36] maybe in the liver that's what's causing
[2289.72 - 2295.24] some of my symptoms my fatigue my eggs
[2292.36 - 2299.68] and pains my Hashimoto and I got this
[2295.24 - 2303.12] low level of viral you know viral um
[2299.68 - 2307.56] activity going on making my blood toxic
[2303.12 - 2310.64] and maybe that's why I don't detox good
[2307.56 - 2312.36] because what the G mutation test leads
[2310.64 - 2314.04] to as a practitioner then teaching
[2312.36 - 2317.08] people you know hey it means you can't
[2314.04 - 2319.44] detox you have no ability to detox your
[2317.08 - 2321.88] homocysteine is all messed up your your
[2319.44 - 2324.16] you know all this stuff is going on and
[2321.88 - 2326.44] you can't detox you're not
[2324.16 - 2329.88] detoxing because you're toxic because
[2326.44 - 2333.36] you have a viral issue creating toxins
[2329.88 - 2335.44] weakening the liver so that conversions
[2333.36 - 2337.92] don't happen back to the liver liver is
[2335.44 - 2342.60] responsible for thousands thousands of
[2337.92 - 2343.64] of of of um of chemical activities
[2342.60 - 2345.56] chemical
[2343.64 - 2348.08] procedures okay chemical
[2345.56 - 2350.80] responsibilities the liver is
[2348.08 - 2353.72] responsible and and in this
[2350.80 - 2358.36] responsibility Factor all this going
[2353.72 - 2360.20] on is the breaking down of chemicals to
[2358.36 - 2363.12] chemicals to chemicals to chemicals
[2360.20 - 2365.04] meaning being used so that Amino and and
[2363.12 - 2366.96] and the production of amino acids and
[2365.04 - 2369.40] the breakdown and the combin ining of
[2366.96 - 2372.36] aminos and the combining of aminos with
[2369.40 - 2375.04] other chemicals all this is done in the
[2372.36 - 2380.04] liver it's one of the most important
[2375.04 - 2382.16] places there is and it's responsible for
[2380.04 - 2383.72] methylation so if you got a viral thing
[2382.16 - 2386.00] in the liver if you've had chronic
[2383.72 - 2389.44] fatigue you got the Epstein bar in the
[2386.00 - 2391.20] liver if you got Hashimoto you got the
[2389.44 - 2393.76] Epstein bar in the liver you're
[2391.20 - 2396.68] eventually going to end up with a gene
[2393.76 - 2399.96] mutation diagnosis which will be in
[2396.68 - 2403.84] accurate the only accurate part is is
[2399.96 - 2407.36] that yes your methylation has dropped
[2403.84 - 2409.16] your ability to methylate and to to you
[2407.36 - 2411.40] know and to combine the folate and the
[2409.16 - 2414.16] folic acid mean with other chemicals and
[2411.40 - 2417.32] break them down so they're usable is
[2414.16 - 2420.96] diminishing that part is correct that's
[2417.32 - 2423.76] why a big part of the whole methylation
[2420.96 - 2426.56] thing and the g mutations I
[2423.76 - 2431.08] like but it's still got holes in it that
[2426.56 - 2435.20] we're covering all in here today so you
[2431.08 - 2437.92] know the conversion of homocysteine to
[2435.20 - 2441.08] um to methionine okay that
[2437.92 - 2444.56] conversion is something that gets
[2441.08 - 2447.40] interfered with when you can't methylate
[2444.56 - 2450.72] so your homocysteine levels can rise the
[2447.40 - 2453.72] conversion is not there once again from
[2450.72 - 2455.40] the liver being clogged up whether
[2453.72 - 2456.92] you're overweight whether you're
[2455.40 - 2460.36] underweight
[2456.92 - 2462.96] whether you feel good whether you don't
[2460.36 - 2466.00] whether your child's diagnosed with the
[2462.96 - 2468.04] G mutation and you know feels fine in
[2466.00 - 2470.12] the moment and then you think your child
[2468.04 - 2472.52] has a gene mutation it means the liver
[2470.12 - 2475.20] is showcasing signs of some wear and
[2472.52 - 2479.28] tear whether it's a really early on
[2475.20 - 2481.72] which happens all the time or later on
[2479.28 - 2483.08] and that will give you the mfrg mutation
[2481.72 - 2484.84] but like I said before if you've been
[2483.08 - 2487.04] diagnosed with any chronic illness
[2484.84 - 2488.64] that's still a mystery and a mystery to
[2487.04 - 2490.68] Alternative doctors to and alternative
[2488.64 - 2492.52] medicine still a mystery and you're
[2490.68 - 2493.96] diagnosed all these different labels
[2492.52 - 2496.40] many of them which we talked about
[2493.96 - 2498.96] already then chances are you'll
[2496.40 - 2501.08] eventually get that MTHFR mutation test
[2498.96 - 2504.12] and be and be told you have
[2501.08 - 2505.52] that but really what's happening is yes
[2504.12 - 2508.20] you have things going on with your
[2505.52 - 2509.44] health and that your health is having
[2508.20 - 2512.72] you know you're struggling with the
[2509.44 - 2516.60] methylation process because of the dirty
[2512.72 - 2519.28] blood the detoxic detoxification issue
[2516.60 - 2520.88] from having dirty blood and the liver
[2519.28 - 2523.08] not being able to perform what it needs
[2520.88 - 2527.16] to perform so the blood gets toxic and
[2523.08 - 2530.52] dirty and you end up with the gene
[2527.16 - 2533.08] mutation test so what do we do being a
[2530.52 - 2535.28] positive so what do we do we can turn
[2533.08 - 2536.88] this around you can change this you can
[2535.28 - 2540.44] get yourself
[2536.88 - 2542.76] better and clean this up so that when
[2540.44 - 2545.32] you go and get your mthf FRG mutation
[2542.76 - 2548.44] test you can get rid of the positive on
[2545.32 - 2549.84] that test and blow the doctor or
[2548.44 - 2552.84] practitioner's
[2549.84 - 2554.80] mind you can because what it's going to
[2552.84 - 2557.60] mean is you're going to lower your
[2554.80 - 2562.20] inflammation so it doesn't trigger off
[2557.60 - 2565.56] the faulty test that was created another
[2562.20 - 2567.52] test that's really not accurate I mean
[2565.56 - 2569.48] it showcases something it showcases a
[2567.52 - 2571.56] little a little bit of elevation of
[2569.48 - 2573.40] inflammation so it's accurate on that
[2571.56 - 2576.16] level it showcases that leads to a
[2573.40 - 2579.64] methylation problem on that level so
[2576.16 - 2581.48] what can we do well first of all go
[2579.64 - 2583.76] antiviral that's the first thing get
[2581.48 - 2586.00] your zinc up to par it's the first thing
[2583.76 - 2588.40] you want to do get your zinc up the par
[2586.00 - 2591.80] start drinking some th tea a little bit
[2588.40 - 2593.64] of thme tea get some oregano capsules
[2591.80 - 2597.20] okay so you can find you know you can
[2593.64 - 2599.60] find any of this stuff also on on uh you
[2597.20 - 2601.68] know I have a little um directory of all
[2599.60 - 2603.60] these things you can find so people know
[2601.68 - 2606.16] the Best Brands just go to medical
[2603.60 - 2608.32] medium.com and and look for this stuff
[2606.16 - 2609.84] we don't sell it okay so we don't have a
[2608.32 - 2612.04] store where we're selling anything but
[2609.84 - 2614.20] it's there so you don't buy the zinc
[2612.04 - 2616.44] that has citric acid so you burn your
[2614.20 - 2620.20] stomach and and create an
[2616.44 - 2622.44] ulcer okay so we so that doesn't happen
[2620.20 - 2625.20] all right so you don't buy the the
[2622.44 - 2627.80] tincture that has corn grain alcohol in
[2625.20 - 2629.68] it so you feed another bacteria or feed
[2627.80 - 2631.96] some kind of sibo problem or whatever it
[2629.68 - 2634.12] is so you know you want the right
[2631.96 - 2636.92] supplements so you do the oregano oil
[2634.12 - 2639.20] capsules that's important Olive Leaf you
[2636.92 - 2642.16] want to bring a little olive leaf in
[2639.20 - 2643.52] cat's claw that's another great one you
[2642.16 - 2647.52] want to have the right
[2643.52 - 2649.88] zinc bring in the zinc the supplement
[2647.52 - 2653.16] methylfolate this is the most critical
[2649.88 - 2654.28] part of methylation right here but yeah
[2653.16 - 2655.56] you might know about it your
[2654.28 - 2657.32] practitioner offers it with a
[2655.56 - 2659.04] methylation problem or a g mutation
[2657.32 - 2661.96] issue they offer the methylfolate but it
[2659.04 - 2664.44] won't work unless your B12 supplement
[2661.96 - 2666.68] has adoil cobalamin in it you won't find
[2664.44 - 2668.84] that information anywhere else but here
[2666.68 - 2670.68] that's how you methylate regardless of
[2668.84 - 2672.68] your liver condition or anything else or
[2670.68 - 2675.08] the dirty blood fixed up and all that
[2672.68 - 2677.08] better you still can methylate when you
[2675.08 - 2678.96] combine these two so that's the
[2677.08 - 2680.72] important part all the other b12's never
[2678.96 - 2682.92] have adinos Sil cobalamin in it so
[2680.72 - 2685.68] methylation still doesn't occur when
[2682.92 - 2687.84] someone has a problem and you want
[2685.68 - 2690.96] vitamin C because vitamin C helps you
[2687.84 - 2693.60] detox like it gets the poisons out of
[2690.96 - 2697.08] the blood so they get
[2693.60 - 2699.88] removed and pushed on Down the Line
[2697.08 - 2702.04] so you want vitamin C and enough vitamin
[2699.88 - 2708.00] C so that's
[2702.04 - 2712.52] important so keep that in your regime um
[2708.00 - 2715.04] line that's a big deal line lowers viral
[2712.52 - 2717.28] loads viral loads are responsible for
[2715.04 - 2719.92] methylation issues viral loads are
[2717.28 - 2722.12] responsible for problems dirty blood the
[2719.92 - 2725.24] liver not working good so get the
[2722.12 - 2727.72] lysine so that's a great one to bring in
[2725.24 - 2730.28] foods get out the eggs get out the dairy
[2727.72 - 2732.16] get out the wheat okay and you'll know
[2730.28 - 2734.68] you go to your alternative practitioner
[2732.16 - 2739.12] you go to your um holistic
[2734.68 - 2741.12] practitioner and you're going to be told
[2739.12 - 2742.68] to get off the weak gluten of course
[2741.12 - 2744.72] you're going to be told to get off maybe
[2742.68 - 2746.80] some dairy products so you want to get
[2744.72 - 2749.28] off of those that's really
[2746.80 - 2752.92] important so when it comes down to the
[2749.28 - 2754.24] foods you want less fat in the foods
[2752.92 - 2756.92] this is really important so you don't
[2754.24 - 2758.40] want the dairy okay you don't want the
[2756.92 - 2760.20] you know you don't want the eggs in
[2758.40 - 2762.88] there you don't want foods that have
[2760.20 - 2765.64] real high fat if you're a meat eater
[2762.88 - 2768.24] lower the fats by lowering the amount of
[2765.64 - 2770.68] meat you're eating because we're talking
[2768.24 - 2772.12] about it's your liver and your liver is
[2770.68 - 2774.68] creating the methylation problem it's
[2772.12 - 2776.68] creating the mthf FRG mutation problem
[2774.68 - 2778.44] that means the more fat in your liver
[2776.68 - 2780.96] the more fat that your liver has to you
[2778.44 - 2784.60] know break down the more bile it has to
[2780.96 - 2787.20] produce and break down more fat in your
[2784.60 - 2788.76] your diet the the less it's going to
[2787.20 - 2791.04] have the ability to rejuvenate the less
[2788.76 - 2793.12] it's going to have the the ability to
[2791.04 - 2795.24] get rid of the poison that's actually
[2793.12 - 2796.92] causing the conversion problems that's
[2795.24 - 2798.80] actually causing the folate and the
[2796.92 - 2800.84] folic you know the the folic acid
[2798.80 - 2803.12] conversion problems and the amino acid
[2800.84 - 2806.76] conversion problems you know with MTHFR
[2803.12 - 2809.60] gene mutation issues so the whole point
[2806.76 - 2811.12] here is if you're doing Foods whe so say
[2809.60 - 2815.04] you're on a plant-based diet don't
[2811.12 - 2816.52] overdo the nuts don't overdo the avocado
[2815.04 - 2818.28] you know so if you're on a plant-based
[2816.52 - 2821.52] diet you know more fresh fruits and
[2818.28 - 2822.96] vegetables more obviously um and you
[2821.52 - 2826.76] know more sweet potatoes but if you're
[2822.96 - 2828.20] on say a Palo diet or a meat eating diet
[2826.76 - 2829.88] you know whatever that might be like you
[2828.20 - 2831.72] do chicken twice a day or something or
[2829.88 - 2834.36] you do turkey for lunch chicken for you
[2831.72 - 2835.88] got to break it down to once a day
[2834.36 - 2838.52] because if you don't you're going to
[2835.88 - 2840.88] have a little too much fat going on so
[2838.52 - 2843.36] that means you know for lunch maybe do
[2840.88 - 2846.00] avocado Which is less fat than chicken
[2843.36 - 2848.72] for lunch so that you just knock down a
[2846.00 - 2850.72] level of fat intake greatly and then at
[2848.72 - 2852.56] dinner do something that you like that's
[2850.72 - 2855.20] in the animal protein realm if you're if
[2852.56 - 2858.76] you're big in animal protein the point
[2855.20 - 2863.48] is is lowering the fat in the diet in
[2858.76 - 2866.28] any way helps stop the the the liver
[2863.48 - 2869.20] from declining so it can pick speed up
[2866.28 - 2871.76] again so it can start to heal clean up
[2869.20 - 2873.36] and so you can start using the different
[2871.76 - 2875.80] things to knock out the viral load that
[2873.36 - 2877.88] could be in the liver that's producing
[2875.80 - 2879.88] the gene mutation test triggering it off
[2877.88 - 2882.92] by producing all of that byproduct
[2879.88 - 2884.96] floating around in the bloodstream so
[2882.92 - 2887.28] for instance let's go over Foods the
[2884.96 - 2889.80] wild blueberries really heal and cleanse
[2887.28 - 2891.80] the liver celery juice cleanses the
[2889.80 - 2894.00] liver so you could do the 16 ounces look
[2891.80 - 2895.24] go to my blog go to my blog and check
[2894.00 - 2898.12] out different things you check out the
[2895.24 - 2899.32] celery juice and it's for you and I want
[2898.12 - 2901.16] you to go into my blog because you're
[2899.32 - 2903.40] going to see a big snap snazzy picture
[2901.16 - 2905.84] of me holding up celery juice that's not
[2903.40 - 2908.00] it I want you doing the celery juice you
[2905.84 - 2909.24] to do it okay I'm doing it at home
[2908.00 - 2911.12] that's already happening so you don't
[2909.24 - 2913.52] need to see that on the blog get there
[2911.12 - 2915.72] and know what the recipe is understand
[2913.52 - 2917.36] do the celery juice and then you know
[2915.72 - 2919.68] bring in the sweet potatoes they help
[2917.36 - 2922.40] cleanse the liver because there's no fat
[2919.68 - 2925.60] in the sweet potato virtually virtually
[2922.40 - 2928.60] none in there and so that helps with the
[2925.60 - 2931.72] liver winter squash helps with the
[2928.60 - 2934.24] healing of the liver so these are some
[2931.72 - 2936.52] of the foods you can do and you know hey
[2934.24 - 2938.60] look if it's winter it's it's cold you
[2936.52 - 2940.92] do more sweet potato do sweet potatoes
[2938.60 - 2944.28] for lunch if you if you love animal
[2940.92 - 2945.96] products you know Skip skip the you know
[2944.28 - 2948.64] whatever it is for lunch turkey or the
[2945.96 - 2950.72] chicken or the the the meat for lunch
[2948.64 - 2952.04] and do the sweet potatoes for lunch
[2950.72 - 2955.64] you're going to be getting your gene
[2952.04 - 2958.04] mutation you know reversed you're going
[2955.64 - 2960.00] to be getting things reversed and then
[2958.04 - 2962.32] for dinner time you can then do whatever
[2960.00 - 2964.04] it is that you do you know and if you're
[2962.32 - 2966.08] and once again if you're vegetarian or
[2964.04 - 2968.12] you're you know vegan or PL base or
[2966.08 - 2970.80] whatever you you want to be that you
[2968.12 - 2973.28] feel is good you know it's incredible
[2970.80 - 2975.84] for liver problems that create the gene
[2973.28 - 2977.68] mutation okay or create the false gene
[2975.84 - 2981.28] mutation test that we talked about all
[2977.68 - 2985.24] through here and so but the best thing
[2981.28 - 2989.20] to do ever is to at least take a moment
[2985.24 - 2991.72] in your life and have it really lowfat
[2989.20 - 2993.28] that means you're doing lots of salads
[2991.72 - 2996.12] with fruit in them or you're doing
[2993.28 - 2997.52] smoothies green smoothies and we talk
[2996.12 - 2999.48] about that all the time the different
[2997.52 - 3001.32] smoothies and everything I mean you'll
[2999.48 - 3003.00] see them on Facebook and Instagram and
[3001.32 - 3004.64] all that so you'll get you get an idea
[3003.00 - 3007.08] better smoothies and you'll find recipes
[3004.64 - 3008.16] in the life-changing Foods book any of
[3007.08 - 3011.24] the
[3008.16 - 3014.00] recipes you know are helpful for the
[3011.24 - 3015.28] gene mutation issue that we have that's
[3014.00 - 3018.92] that's rampant out there that we're
[3015.28 - 3020.96] talking about see lowering the fats gets
[3018.92 - 3023.20] the liver to produce less bile and it
[3020.96 - 3024.76] gets it to rejuvenate fast so when
[3023.20 - 3026.88] you're doing that celery juice and then
[3024.76 - 3029.24] eating some oranges in the morning
[3026.88 - 3032.08] having a mango then lunchtime having a
[3029.24 - 3035.36] spinach tomato you know um spinach
[3032.08 - 3037.44] tomato soup and then in the afternoon
[3035.36 - 3040.16] you're having um you're having celery
[3037.44 - 3042.20] sticks and apples and other things like
[3040.16 - 3044.20] that and then you know for dinner time
[3042.20 - 3047.24] you do the sweet potatoes for dinner
[3044.20 - 3049.92] it's something like that in that realm
[3047.24 - 3052.88] that lowers your fats enough in one day
[3049.92 - 3056.36] to purge the liver so that you're not
[3052.88 - 3059.72] told you can't detox so that your liver
[3056.36 - 3062.92] can recover and cleanse and when it
[3059.72 - 3065.48] recovers and cleanses you're home free
[3062.92 - 3068.48] with the methylation issue and you can
[3065.48 - 3070.68] be freed from the test that tells you
[3068.48 - 3073.04] you have a gene mutation you can
[3070.68 - 3075.00] actually be freed from that over time
[3073.04 - 3077.20] part of that like I said is getting the
[3075.00 - 3079.92] viral load down because it's
[3077.20 - 3082.28] viruses and some heavy metals that lie
[3079.92 - 3084.44] in the liver that they lay in the liver
[3082.28 - 3086.76] there they hide in there and they're
[3084.44 - 3089.36] working on creating junk and byproduct
[3086.76 - 3091.40] and garbage and this could be
[3089.36 - 3093.04] responsible for your symptoms too the
[3091.40 - 3095.08] whole thing the viruses that create
[3093.04 - 3097.20] chronic fatigue fibromyalgia the Epstein
[3095.08 - 3099.32] bar that's a big one all of these
[3097.20 - 3101.00] different viruses that sit in the liver
[3099.32 - 3105.00] they create whatever your symptoms are
[3101.00 - 3108.64] and your additional mtfr gene mutation
[3105.00 - 3112.72] you see what I mean it even creates that
[3108.64 - 3115.64] so in short the viral issue is creating
[3112.72 - 3117.60] your gene mutation that's that's what
[3115.64 - 3119.20] I'm talking about being inside the liver
[3117.60 - 3122.08] getting it clogged up getting it
[3119.20 - 3124.40] sluggish getting it problematic and then
[3122.08 - 3126.76] your blood gets dirty your methylation
[3124.40 - 3128.80] ability drops greatly because the liver
[3126.76 - 3130.16] has so much to do with methylation along
[3128.80 - 3133.36] with that part in the colon I was
[3130.16 - 3136.44] talking to you about you guys about and
[3133.36 - 3138.24] so what do you do you get the antivirals
[3136.44 - 3140.28] going on like we talked about the zinc
[3138.24 - 3142.52] and you bring in some ibrite try some
[3140.28 - 3144.72] ibrite too talk to your practitioner say
[3142.52 - 3147.80] you want to go antiviral bring in some
[3144.72 - 3150.76] ibrite bringing lemon bomb red clover
[3147.80 - 3152.92] tea cleans out the blood real nice by
[3150.76 - 3155.12] the way could really reverse that
[3152.92 - 3158.48] inflamation that's triggering off that
[3155.12 - 3160.88] gene mutation test you know and lemon
[3158.48 - 3162.76] bomb the nettle Leaf the olive leaf I
[3160.88 - 3165.40] talked about earlier you bring a little
[3162.76 - 3167.68] bit of that in the cat's Claw is amazing
[3165.40 - 3171.20] the reason why cats claw works so good
[3167.68 - 3173.04] with lime patients now and you know and
[3171.20 - 3174.92] cats claw has been you know that's been
[3173.04 - 3178.24] something that Spirits always promoted
[3174.92 - 3181.04] back since I was a child and that cat's
[3178.24 - 3183.76] claw works because it's killing off
[3181.04 - 3186.72] viruses and it eventually can lead you
[3183.76 - 3188.72] to not having a methylation problem now
[3186.72 - 3190.24] you may have already a diagnosis of
[3188.72 - 3192.32] something and you don't trigger off as a
[3190.24 - 3194.68] methylation problem it doesn't mean you
[3192.32 - 3197.60] don't have one the test itself is not
[3194.68 - 3199.72] concrete it's not Ironclad so it's
[3197.60 - 3202.28] picking up inflammation sometimes and
[3199.72 - 3205.20] sometimes it doesn't it's not perfect
[3202.28 - 3207.96] there's no test in medical research and
[3205.20 - 3211.88] IAL science that is absolutely perfect
[3207.96 - 3214.52] and even blood typing is not perfect in
[3211.88 - 3217.08] science and research testing sometimes
[3214.52 - 3219.28] someone can have one blood type and two
[3217.08 - 3221.00] months later get it tested again and it
[3219.28 - 3223.52] be different that has happened in
[3221.00 - 3225.76] history That's Not Unusual so what I'm
[3223.52 - 3230.28] saying is even the most Ironclad what we
[3225.76 - 3231.92] feel like sometimes is not lemon water
[3230.28 - 3234.56] get the lemon water make sure you're
[3231.92 - 3236.96] doing it every day 16 oun twice a day
[3234.56 - 3238.96] can help your can reverse a methylation
[3236.96 - 3241.28] problem remember the B12 I talked about
[3238.96 - 3242.92] as well all these things combined keep
[3241.28 - 3245.44] your fats low and you're heading in the
[3242.92 - 3247.76] right direction and you will reverse the
[3245.44 - 3250.64] diagnosis listen I love you I stand
[3247.76 - 3252.48] behind you 100% thank you for hanging in
[3250.64 - 3254.20] there on this show this show might have
[3252.48 - 3256.40] gotten some people mad might have gotten
[3254.20 - 3259.20] some people upset hang in there have
[3256.40 - 3261.12] faith stay strong I love you and just
[3259.20 - 3262.44] know that you know one day at a time you
[3261.12 - 3265.44] take care
[3262.44 - 3265.44] bye-bye
