post medical medium books the internet

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
has changed everything

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,440
all the major clinics without any

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,000
evidence or or data or or any kind of

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,840
evidence on any level

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,080
which because they don't they have now

124
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,240
taken all the diseases all the major

125
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,199
clinics and they've taken medical medium

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,199
information that epstein-barr

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,080
could be causing all the different

128
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
conditions like fibro and hashimoto's

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,080
and guillain-barre and multiple

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
sclerosis and all these things and i

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
thought i was the crazy epstein-barr guy

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,720
that nobody would

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,240
think was was legit or something

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
they still don't have it totally right

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
because they say i've seen bars a

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,759
trigger

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,080
or linked to

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
because they can't go all the way

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
because if they go all the way they're

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
going to discredit the whole body

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
attacking itself theory which is

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,160
grandfathered in and you can't go

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
against that theory if you're a doctor a

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,280
practitioner or a clinic but the clinics

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
took

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,199
published medical medium information all

147
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,199
the clinics the major clinics now in the

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,240
world have have poached and taken

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,479
medical medium documented information

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
medical medium publication material that

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
was all pre any of it and they've

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,759
rewritten history now

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
it on the internet

154
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
medical medium brought up the whole

155
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
thing about the plague being the plague

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,320
creating reactivated epstein-barr well

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
they took that too after the fact after

158
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,680
it was published so here i am the

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
epstein-barr guy articles out there lots

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
of articles about the medical medium

161
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,199
ripping me down and tearing me apart and

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,520
telling me that i didn't know what i was

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,000
talking about and i'm not a really smart

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
guy because i'm just a medium

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,840
or a psychic or something and he doesn't

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
know anything about epstein-barr then

167
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759
how come the major clinics you know the

168
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
one like mayonnaise

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
you like the mayonnaise clinic

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,120

171
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
clinic you guys know what i'm talking

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880
about

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,120
right so the mayonnaise clinic

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,120
has now re-changed it we changed

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,880
everything with no science behind it

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,560
they have no studies that show an

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,560
epstein-barr bug actually doing anything

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,400
and the mayonnaise clinic now

179
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
has literally because all the functional

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
medicine doctors that work alongside the

181
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
conventional doctors in the mayonnaise

182
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
clinic

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,080
they literally take

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
the medical medium epstein-barr

185
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
information

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
and they rewrite it the way they want to

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
see it but they take it all

188
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,680
and it's kind of crazy how it works when

189
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,160
you think about it little old me this

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
little old medium guy that's just not

191
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
important in the world and has never

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
done anything for anybody and whatever

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,919
these big clinics with billions of

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
dollars behind it for some reason all

195
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,840
their all their doctors have to litter

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
and the researchers have to go to

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
medical medium books

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,479
and they actually have to take it out of

199
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,479
here

200
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
and put it on the internet so we're

201
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
talking about the four stages of

202
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,400
epstein-barr that's where we're at right

203
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
now

204
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,639
and it's not just mono it's not just

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
mono we're talking about right we're

206
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
talking about epstein-barr which yes

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,280
puts you into a mononucleosis state

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
we're going into that a little bit

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
good to see you guys we're live right

210
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,960
now this is a fun day we're going into

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
ebv we got some information we're going

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
to talk about how ebv works inside the

213
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,319
body we're going to talk about what ebv

214
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
feeds on

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,560
we're going to talk about how to destroy

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,560
and kill ebv how about that too we're

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,919
going to talk about how to annihilate

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,720
ebv so ebv doesn't ruin your life

219
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,560
or ruin your life down the road

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
it's pretty simple

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
you can come into this world

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,879
with epc bar

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
right

224
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
you can come into this world with

225
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
epstein var

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,080
and you can leave this world

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
with epstein-barr

228
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,319
okay

229
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
you can come into the world with

230
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
epstein-barr

231
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
and you can leave this world with

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,759
epstein-barr

233
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,360
that's how it works

234
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
in the womb

235
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,759
you can contract epstein-barr it's where

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,320
a lot of people contract it

237
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
from their parents

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
and then

239
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,519
we can die down the road many many years

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,159
down the road

241
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,159
suffering from epstein-barr

242
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,160
or

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,480
you can contract epstein-barr and

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
annihilate it and kill it

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
and that's what you want to do

246
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
you want to break it down

247
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,399
destroy it and that's what you want to

248
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,240
do okay

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
the end says you're just trying to make

250
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
money

251
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399

252
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
somebody else because you can get the

253
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,279

261
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,839
unless that wasn't for me and that was

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
for somebody else that could have been

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
for somebody else the end if that's for

264
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
somebody else i'm totally grateful for

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
you

266
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,920
epstein barr

267
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,600
okay in stage one you cut contract

268
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,560
epstein-barr

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,959
right in stage one it sits in your body

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,720
and floats around is what it does so

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,920
when you first get your first epstein

272
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
bar like

273
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
you kiss somebody and you end up getting

274
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,839
epstein barr or you kiss somebody or

275
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
you you're on a public toilet seat and

276
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,040
you pick up efficient bar you're in a

277
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
restaurant a chef cuts their finger and

278
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
bleeds in your food and you catch two

279
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,760
epstein bars you can catch two epstein

280
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
bar varieties in one shot just from a

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
chef cutting their finger in the

282
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
restaurant

283
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
right

284
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
so you get your first epstein bar your

285
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
second epstein bar it sits in your body

286
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,519
and it floats around and it could float

287
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,480
around for a long time six months two

288
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,720
months a year two days

289
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
it can go into

290
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,560
mononucleosis within two days it can go

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
into mononucleosis six years from now it

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,720
can go into mono ten years from now but

293
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
it can float around and what happens is

294
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
it floats around until you have a weak

295
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,079
spot

296
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,200
and that weak spot is could be anything

297
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,440
trauma an emotional hardship a divorce a

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
breakup a friendship a relationship a

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
fight with a co-worker stress financial

300
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,000
stress whatever it is and then you break

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,079
your your immune system starts to weaken

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
and break down and break down and break

303
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
down

304
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,399
and when it starts to break down

305
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
we get in trouble you guys see a bunch

306
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
of supplements in the front someone

307
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,399
might say hey look what's he trying to

308
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,160
do i'm not sponsored by the companies

309
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,880
and i purchased these

310
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,640
i purchased them so these i bought

311
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,519
and paid for and i'm not sponsored

312
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,160
the point is here i want to just get

314
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,680
that on the table right now before

315
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
someone thinks is he just trying to do a

316
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,079
sales pitch today right

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,079
and the books they're so marked look so

318
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,440
low on amazon right now

319
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,560
so low

320
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
it's like

321
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
ridiculous so i'm just laying it which

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,360
it so low i want people to get it at the

324
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
cheapest price they possibly can so

325
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
we're on epstein-barr right now you guys

326
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
forced four stages of epstein-barr we're

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
talking about

328
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,200
we contract and catch mono it sits in us

329
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
and then our immune system breaks down

330
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,519
when we have some kind of trauma

331
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,480
or maybe exposure

332
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,200
any kind of exposure chemical exposure

333
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,760
breaks down the immune system

334
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,920
right scented candles with fragrances

335
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,560
breaks down the immune system so any

336
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,360
kind of exposure pharmaceuticals break

337
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,480
down the immune system right there

338
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
okay

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
when it breaks down the immune system at

340
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
the same time it can also feed the

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,440
epstein-barr virus right so you can also

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,760
feed it so the virus loves to eat things

343
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,000
it loves the perfumes colognes chemicals

344
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
and perfumes colognes chemicals and

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
scented candles it loves to eat them

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,079
giving you a rundown loves to eat metals

347
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,360
and pharmaceuticals it loves to eat

348
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
copper

349
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
copper you're drinking out of copper

350
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,480
thermoses you're going to feed your

351
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,440
epstein bar and you will guarantee

352
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,839
eczema and psoriasis down the road

353
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
if you want a hundred percent guaranteed

354
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
to get excellent psoriasis down the road

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
i promise you this and you can just be

356
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,000
and you're going to have epsilon

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
symptoms down the road like eczema

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,920
psoriasis

371
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,600
this is an important day right here to

372
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,360
talk about this because people don't

373
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,440
realize the suffering that's happening

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,480
out there you guys know you guys know

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240

390
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,320
neurological lime you've got the

391
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,839

back on

401
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
it's here right the information is here

402
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
you just came on and you're wondering

403
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,920
what does he know well

404
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
the clinics all around the country and

405
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
the world are taking medical medium

406
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
information about abstinent bar

407
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,560
published here first and now they've

408
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,160
rewritten history on the internet

409
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
and they're attaching epstein-barr to

410
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
everything

411
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,959
meanwhile i was laughed at for years for

412
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,760
being the epstein-barr guy

413
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,000
by naysayers and haters

414
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
so we're about saving lives medical

415
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
medium new edition is right here this

416
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
book has saved a lot of lives over the

417
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
years it's well known for that which is

418
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
incredible and a lot of doctors use the

419
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
information all around the country and

420
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,880
around the world so let's go a little

421
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,959
bit into this how does epstein-barr work

422
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,000
stage one it goes in you

423
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,720
when your immune system gets broken down

424
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,720
it goes into stage two

425
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,360
mononucleosis

426
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,959
mononucleosis is stage two is what it is

427
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
you guys

428
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,880
that's what happens right there

429
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,360
stage 2 is mononucleosis

430
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,079
and so when you're in mononucleosis your

431
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,800
immune system is battling so now your

432
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,800
immune system is at war right here so

433
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,959
keep that in mind so your white blood

434
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
cells are at war

435
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,240
with

436
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
your

437
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,880
invader

438
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,680
so you got the invader

439
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
and you got your white blood cell that's

440
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,120
mononucleosis right there

441
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
you don't think you had mono but all you

442
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,279
had to do was have a scratchy throat and

443
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,399
fuel under the weather that's all

444
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
you may think you didn't have

445
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,920
mononucleosis but in college you might

446
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,519
have been sick for two weeks what seemed

447
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
to be like a cold and you were coughing

448
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
and all flammy and not feeling good and

449
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,240
tired that was mono

450
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
mono

451
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
it comes in so many different ways it

452
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,680
doesn't mean it's a serious mono where

453
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
you're sick for three months with mino

454
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,639
or six months because many people are

455
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,040
sick with mono for three months six

456
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,440
months two months eight months

457
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,240
you can just be sick with mono for just

458
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,839
a week but you had your motto and your

459
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
immune system went into war with the

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
variety of epstein-barr that you've been

461
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,680
infected with

462
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
after were infected with the epstein

463
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,199
barr and we went into war

464
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,519
your immune system eventually overcomes

465
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,800
and it pushes epstein-barr

466
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
away

467
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,880
epstein-barr doesn't leave the body it

468
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
stays in your body and then it enters

469
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,959
into

470
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,880
your organs now what epstein-barr likes

471
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,120
to do is it likes to head into the liver

472
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,279
that's the number one place epstein-barr

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,680
likes to go it's the liver so keep that

474
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
in mind right there

475
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,040
esteem bar loves the liver

476
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,959
after mononucleosis stage two it goes

477
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,680
into the liver and it camps out and

478
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,120
hides out but it also can go into the

479
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
spleen

480
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,839
not only can it go into the spleen but

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
it can go into the reproductive system

482
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
too so keep that in mind as well i've

483
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,360
seen bar likes to go into the

484
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,440
reproductive system

485
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,040
so it heads into

486
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
the uterus

487
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,520
it heads into the ovaries and now we

488
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,439
have pcos

489
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
so epstein-barr starts to cause problems

490
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,839
like pcos endometriosis and fibroids

491
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,720
because after

492
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,839
stage two mononucleosis it camped out in

493
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,679
the reproductive system spleen and liver

494
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,400
that's where it likes to be

495
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,919
as the time goes by it could be years it

496
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,439
could be months depending on how low

497
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
your immune system it could be years

498
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,520
that go by maybe it's even a decade that

499
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,280
goes by something happens

500
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
an epstein-barr

501
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,160
ends up

502
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
proliferating

503
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,400
it could have been proliferating because

504
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
it's actually feeding off of chemicals

505
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
it could be

506
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
it could be growing in numbers because

507
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,799
it's feeding off of all different kinds

508
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
of exposures it could be growing in

509
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
numbers because you were told to eat a

510
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,760
really healthy egg diet

511
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,440
and so when we're told that look you

512
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,960
need to be on eggs that's what you need

513
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
to be do you think you know you think

514
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
you're doing the right things and then

515
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,919
the epstein-barr feeds off of the eggs

516
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
every time you're eating the eggs it

517
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,919
feeds off the eggs and then out of

518
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,600
nowhere a relationship problem happens

519
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
something occurs

520
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,080
your life gets toppled a little bit

521
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,160
emotionally and between the bad foods

522
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,799
that feed the virus plus the emotional

523
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
things that are happening you end up

524
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,480
having another bout of mono but it

525
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
doesn't feel like that

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
the virus

527
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,720
takes advantage of a lowered immune

528
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,720
system and starts to head to where

529
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,280
to your thyroid

530
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
now you're a candidate for down the road

531
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
to have hypothyroidism so now you're at

532
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,840
your functional medicine doctor's office

533
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,520
or regular doctor's office or your

534
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
naturopathic doctor's office he's

535
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
running some tests she's running some

536
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,000
tests and she's like hey um i think you

537
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,320
might have hypothyroid

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,480
i think you might have hashimoto's what

539
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
no one realizes that was actually

540
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,880
epstein-barr it got into the thyroid and

541
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,440
it created hypothyroidism

542
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,600
hyperthyroidism it created hashimoto's

543
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,760
thyroiditis hey you might actually have

544
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,160
a cyst on your thyroid you might

545
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,720
actually have a little tumor on your

546
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
thyroid

547
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,120
you might have a nodule on your thyroid

548
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,799
no one realizes that's the epstein-barr

549
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,520
see how it works you guys

550
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,919
so now we're in stage three stage three

551
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,760
of epsinbar virus is your thyroid that's

552
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,360
when the thyroid conditions can happen

553
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
and they may be overlooked completely by

554
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
your doctor because you can have a

555
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
hypothyroid problem and it not even be

556
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,360
detectable so many doctors know that now

557
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,960
they're learning that now

558
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
this is all medical medium information

559
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
this isn't me researching stuff so if

560
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,880
you hear copycats out there in research

561
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,720
papers they've taken it from here or

562
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
books or whatever or people on the

563
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
internet

564
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,120
this has always been medical media

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,640
information since i was five years old

566
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320
and it hasn't changed it's always been

567
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,039
consistent

568
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,880
and not contradictive

569
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,120
so hold the whole point is here we're in

570
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
stage three of epson bar so you guys on

571
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,559
telegrams good to see you guys on tick

572
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,000
tock glad you guys are here too on

573
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,360
youtube facebook rumble

574
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,919
so

575
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,280
stage three of fcm bar is when the

576
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,360
epstein bar

577
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,640
sits inside the thyroid

578
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,720
camps out

579
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,120
and creates eventually hypothyroidism

580
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,159
hyperthyroidism graves

581
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,880
right cysts nodules tumors

582
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,280
hashimoto's thyroiditis but you may not

583
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,520
even see the numbers

584
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
yet it takes years sometimes for

585
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
epstein-barr just to sit into that

586
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
thyroid but here's the next problem

587
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
the next problem is is it sits in your

588
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,039
thyroid it starts to break down your

589
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,280
immune health more and more as time goes

590
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,919
on and we get more and more exposure so

591
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,760
now we're in stage three epstein barr

592
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,039
and we're eating more eggs than that

593
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
what's what we're doing because we're

594
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,480
taught to eat more eggs

595
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
you showed his healing says so much

596
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
stolen medical medium information out

597
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,559
there but then they want to use it to

598
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,240
point people to their crappy products

599
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,760
or their pharmaceuticals or their fake

600
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,360
genetics their

601
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,440
theories it wasn't like this five years

602
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,600
ago each other it's turned into an

603
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,280
insanity out there everybody's using

604
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
medical medium info that was published

605
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,440
and documented by medical medium first

606
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,880
they're all using it every influencers

607
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
are using it they're actually writing

608
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
things post about it out there and never

609
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
and never anyone's

610
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,320
even saying where it comes from it's a

611
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,679
doggy dog world

612
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
everybody's trying to sell something i

613
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,960
have i have respect for that i mean

614
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,000
anybody wants to do whatever they want

615
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
to do i

616
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
i'm not to judge him i can't judge

617
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,760
anybody

618
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,159
but i will say this

619
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,159
just doing people who are sick of this

620
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
dish in this justice because what

621
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
happens is when you're sick and can't

622
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
find your way back to know where the

623
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,919
information is and how are you going to

624
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,159
heal they're going to say oh you've got

625
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,159
epstein-barr oh really i do i finally

626
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,240

628
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
this charcoal

629
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,960
and then you get sick and you die in

630
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
five years or eight years or you get so

631
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,320
sick you can't function

632
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,559
wait a minute i have seen bar what do i

633
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,120

634
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,360
great you gave me the answer at 17 bar

635
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,520
let me take all this apple cider vinegar

636
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,679
or some other crappy product so what

637
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
happens is people end up getting totally

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,919
taken because they don't know where the

639
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,360
information comes from and then

640
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,200
i care because the suffering suffering's

641
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,679
great out there

642
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,360
so in stage 3 epstein-barr when the

643
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,200
epstein-barr virus is in the thyroid

644
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
what happens you guys is that the immune

645
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
system can break down again we can go

646
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,400
through a divorce we can go through a

647
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
relationship breakup we can go through a

648
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
great loss we can go through a lot of

649
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,840
stress we can go through some hard

650
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,039
struggles everybody goes through a bunch

651
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,280
of stuff

652
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,679
right or we're getting exposed we're

653
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
getting so exposed by so many toxic

654
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
chemicals chemicals we're getting more

655
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,960
metals in us we're getting more metals

656
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,039
than ever before we're eating lots of

657
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
tuna we're getting whatever it is that's

658
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,960
happening we're getting exposed we're

659
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,799
told to have fish oil capsules right and

660
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,480
we're getting exposed so what happens is

661
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,280
eventually your immune system cracks

662
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,240
maybe the last ticket

663
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,159
the last problem that was created maybe

664
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
the last problem that like the straw

665
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
that broke the camel's back

666
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,400
maybe the straw that broke the camel's

667
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,159
back

668
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,320
was here you are your immune system was

669
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,600
weakening you're 40 years old you're 35

670
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,559
years old your immune system is

671
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,559
weakening right

672
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,720
and then

673
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,080
all of a sudden

674
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,840
you think you've got a tick bite or

675
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,919
something because you're so sick you're

676
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,320
getting neurological symptoms and the

677
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
neurological symptoms

678
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
are getting worse so now you're at a

679
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,280
specialist now you're at a neurologist

680
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,080
now that you're at another doctor but

681
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,240
you don't know it which you have instead

682
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,240
of lyme disease for some reason it won't

683
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,799
stay up there today instead of lyme

684
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,520
disease

685
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,279
you have epstein-barr

686
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,159
that's what you have

687
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,159
you got the ebv

688
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,640
the tick is the trigger but there's a

689
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,559
lot of other triggers

690
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,559
maybe a divorce was a trigger maybe a

691
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,240
car accident was a trigger maybe a

692
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
stressful car accident was a trigger

693
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,760
maybe the loss of a loved one was a

694
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,919
trigger maybe something else was true

695
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,000
maybe a beast thing was a trigger maybe

696
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,840
something was a trigger the tick can be

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
a trigger because it knocks the immune

698
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,000
system lower and then

699
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,960
the epstein bar that's been sitting in

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,159
your thyroid in stage three

701
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,159
goes to stage four

702
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,480
what people don't realize

703
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,960
is that the majority of people walking

704
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,559
around with neurological conditions and

705
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,840
symptoms

706
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,400
are stage four

707
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,799
ebb

708
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,159
they're stage four

709
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,360
stage four

710
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,279
ebv is not like stage four cancer

711
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,360
it's stage four ebv

712
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,080
what that means is it hit the nervous

713
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,640
system epstein-barr leaves the thyroid

714
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,720
you guys on tick-tock

715
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,880
it leaves the thyroid when your immune

716
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,880
system is broken down

717
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,679
and it heads to the nerves

718
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,440
which nerves the vagus nerves so let's

719
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,559
go into this a little bit one of the

720
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
places

721
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,760
and you you'll you'll be mind blown with

722
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,159
this

723
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,279
one of the places

724
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:15,840
that have seen bar heads

725
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
is the nerve channel in the ear

726
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,640
so stage 4 epstein barr

727
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,200
means

728
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,799
the bug

729
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,279
will go into the inner ear and when it

730
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,600
goes into the inner ear it affects the

731
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,600
nerve channel in the inner ear

732
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,159
and then you get tinnitus and ringing in

733
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,840
the ears how many people do you know

734
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,960
have the popping fluttering buzzing

735
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
hissing poofing

736
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,400
sound and ringing sound and vibrating

737
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,919
sound in the ear and they have all these

738
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,799
problems with their tinnitus and

739
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,720
everything else right that's from

740
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,640
epstein-barr bug

741
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,080
that's what it is that's stage four eb

742
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,320
bug

743
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
i have to use that

744
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,240
that term

745
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,559
okay i talk about that in the first book

746
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,559
right

amazon it's a great gift for people you

754
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
know if they're sick

755
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,520
if you got the ringing in the ear you

756
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
got the tinnitus or get it free at the

757
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,000
library get it free of the library you

758
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,679
got the tinnitus in the ring in the year

759
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,159
you got the bug that's stage four bug

760
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,840
another place it goes is in the vagus

761
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,559
nerves so the ebv bug goes into

762
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,799
the vagus nerves when it goes there

763
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,799
you've got the vertigo the dizziness the

764
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,200
vertigo the feeling of being on a boat

765
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,880
the rocking on a boat you got all that

766
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,279
and on top of that

767
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,279
epstein barr can create anxiety because

768
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,000
of the phrenic and vagus nerves get

769
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,159
inflamed they swell

770
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
so when the vagus nerves and the phrenic

771
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,120
nerves swell you guys you get the

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
balance problems

773
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,960
you get the vertigo

774
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,679
you get the feeling on a boat you get

775
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,360
the dizziness you get the anxiety

776
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,200
this is medical medium information about

777
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,520
anxiety and got anxiety

778
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,760
and now you see out there epstein barr

779
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,960
causes anxiety someone wrote about

780
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
something or really because there's no

781
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,640
science that shows it and it was

782
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,320
published here first

783
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,120
or epstein-barr has something to do with

784
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
vagus nerves

785
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,480
vagus nerves when they swell up you end

786
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,480
up getting the anxiety so what happens

787
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,559
is the virus in stage 4 releases

788
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,880
neurotoxins the neurotoxins go to the

789
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,200
vagus nerves swell them up and you end

790
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
up with anxiety that's why people have

791
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
the panic attacks that's why people

792
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,960
can't they got the panic attacks they

793
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,399
got this they're sweating profusely

794
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,399
they're nervous they feel like they

795
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,240
gotta run around or they can't handle

796
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,559
they can't sit still or they're just

797
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,760
trapped with their stomach flipping the

798
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,760
whole bit

799
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,320
and the fact that they're even trying to

800
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,080
link the vagus nerves to anxiety that's

801
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,080
medical medium information originally

802
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,440
so

803
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,760
we're in stage 4 epstein-barr right now

804
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
fc bar can create tinnitus ringing in

805
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,000
the ear when it's in in stage four it

806
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,760
can create vertigo and dizziness when

807
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,159
it's in stage four you guys it can

808
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,399
create a lot of problems and what

809
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,159
happens is as we get older we start

810
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,600
getting all these epstein-barr symptoms

811
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,440
and then we get these autoimmune

812
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,240
diagnoses you can end up with any kind

813
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,320
of diagnosis lupus and r.a and

814
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
neurological lyme and fibromyalgia and

815
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
chronic fatigue syndrome and people

816
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,799
don't realize this is all epstein-barr

817
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,039
related and it's stage four epstein-barr

818
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,720
this is neurological symptoms caused by

819
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,840
epstein-barr so what are we gonna do

820
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,799
about it this is stage four

821
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,240
we gotta learn to kill

822
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,559
the bug no one knows how to do that the

823
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,240
reason why so many people got their

824
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
lives back with medical medium

825
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,159
information the reason why lives were

826
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
saved around the world the reason why

827
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
when it was first published and this

828
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,279
information got out there people were

829
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,960
like oh my god i now i know what's wrong

830
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,360
with me i can't believe it

831
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,200
i can't believe this

832
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,640
and the reason why they're learning now

833
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,559
like

834
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,559
what's happening now like because of the

835
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,919
plague the reactivated epstein-barr

836
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,919
comes from medical medium information

837
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,640
right people are like oh my god it's

838
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,360
like i know the answers now so what do i

839
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440

or anything like that i talk about

863
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,880
reactivated ebv in this book right here

864
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,840
where it was published first medical

865
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
medium publication

866
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,880
the deal is

867
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,559
it's like there's something we can do

868
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
for it and about it so let's get into it

869
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,960
right now

870
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,840
how does anybody know

871
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,840
how to knock down ebv

872
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
out there

873
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
when there's nothing out there that can

874
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,000
help anybody figure that out they don't

875
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,919
know what kills off ebv they didn't even

876
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,880
know ebv causes all these problems i

877
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,799
just ran by you guys

878
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,960
but what i have seen

879
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,960
from the source of information that i

880
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
was blessed to have starting since age

881
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,720
four

882
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,039
was i've seen miraculous results

883
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,720
when you use specific things

884
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,200
for these conditions

885
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,960
when you're going after ebv

886
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,360
and so i talk about this so let's go

887
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,120
into some basics right here

888
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,519
if i had

889
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,600
epstein-barr and i was struggling

890
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,360
suffering and i had the thyroid problems

891
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,440
and i had all these other conditions and

892
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,200
i had the ringing in the ears

893
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,600
and i had the dizziness and i had the

894
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,120
aches and pains and the fatigue and i

895
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
had even more than that the eczema

896
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,320
psoriasis or whatever it is all combined

897
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,159
or an autoimmune diagnosis

898
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,799
then i'd be doing some really good stuff

899
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,960
here w green says well you've helped me

900
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,960
to fix all the boat rocking anxiety and

901
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,200
tinnitus bless your heart so glad you're

902
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
here

903
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,240
yeah age four age four

904
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,080
so what i've learned okay

905
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,440
because i'm a student

906
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,320
is what i am

907
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
right

908
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,080
i'm a student

909
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,080
of the source of information the source

910
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,799
that since age 4 has been teaching me

911
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,799
i'm a student and a messenger

912
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,159
is what i am

913
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,279
and so all i can do is tell you what has

914
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,880
worked

915
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,640
what the information that was delivered

916
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,279
to me how it helps so many people

917
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,440
and that's why the mm info has the

918
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,120
street cred that's why it has the street

919
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
credibility

920
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,320
that's why it's net it's known out there

921
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,679
in the world because it works right i'm

922
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,760
the messenger for it but it works

923
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,360
so what do we do so if i had

924
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,559
epstein-barr and i was suffering and

925
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,840
struggling

926
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,840
i'd make sure i was on zinc

927
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,000
been 35 plus years trying to teach

928
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,840
people to take zinc right it's critical

929
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,840
that's what i would do you ask your

930
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,919
doctor what's right for you i'm just

931
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,000
going to tell you if i had epstein-barr

932
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,399
i'd be taking the liquid zinc sulfate

933
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
this is the best one this is the vimergy

934
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
i'm not sponsored

935
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,519
but it's of emergency fees and victor i

936
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,519
am is in mary e-r-g-y

937
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,559
vimergy.com that's the zinc i would take

938
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,840
there's no additives there's nothing

939
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,039
like that in there it's the best stuff

940
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,159
there is

941
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,720
i would take golden seal

942
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,880
is what i would do

943
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,320
like for me if that was happening to me

944
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,360
and i had all these problems i'd be

945
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,919
doing four dropper fulls twice a day

946
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,159
and i'd be doing that periodically but i

947
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,640
got protocols in the book i'd be doing

948
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,720
two dropper holes twice a day if i was

949
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,399
somebody i maybe i would do one but i

950
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,519
would do a little something maybe you're

951
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,159
somebody that doesn't take any

952
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,279
supplements you do six tiny drops twice

953
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,080
a day

954
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,640
but that's what i would do right

955
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,039
that's what i would do

956
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
i would take licorice root

957
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,840
periodically ask your doctor what's

958
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,640
right for you i'm just telling you what

959
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,320
i would do and what i recommend my loved

960
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,960
ones

961
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
and friends

962
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,240
i would do licorice root and the quality

963
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,359
matters because if you don't have the

964
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,560
right stuff you can't knock down that

965
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,040
ebv

966
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,520
it takes the right things to knock down

967
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,679
and crush that bug yeah if you don't

968
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,079
have the right things then you work with

969
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,560
other stuff

970
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,480
you work with protocols like the foods

971
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,079
you take it on that angle

972
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520
the one thing about medical medium

973
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,679
information

974
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,320
is that you can literally start with

975
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,879
celery juice

976
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,639
and start knocking down bugs

977
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,639
you might be so sick though and have so

978
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,240
many bugs going on for so long you might

979
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,599
need a little bit more and then a little

980
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,119
bit more and then you take it to the

981
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,119
next level to the next level

982
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,000
i see a lot of people jennifer says

983
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,560
quercetin quercetin

984
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,560
is a fine enough antioxidant but you'll

985
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,160
see it's not on the list of things

986
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,440
because it doesn't knock down

987
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,599
epstein-barr

988
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
so what it does though

989
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,640
is the vitamin c

990
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,800
that's critical

991
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,560
right that's critical

992
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,800
so that's that's a really important key

993
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,320
right there you'll see a lot of times

994
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,000
out there what people have done over the

995
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
years if they they've taken medical

996
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,640
medium information from the books a lot

997
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,800
of doctors right

998
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,560
and they've used it so it's given them a

999
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
platform

1000
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,839
and then like a lot of internet doctors

1001
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,200
that are selling a lot of things and

1002
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,960
stuff like that gives them a platform

1003
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,520
and then they'll sell corset tin but

1004
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
quercetin doesn't knock down

1005
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,880
fsteen bar

1006
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
it doesn't do what it it's that's not

1007
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,119
enough to really knock down epsine bar

1008
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,680
but the vitamin c is right so that's the

1009
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,839
micro c the one that really

1010
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,920
is gentle and powerful right that's the

1011
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,079
vimorgy if anybody wants to know right

1012
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,040
there that's bimrgy.com i'm not

1013
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,280
sponsored it's just the stuff that works

1014
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,839
these are victor i am as the mary e r g

1015
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,880
y energy.com

1016
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,640
ray

1017
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,280
lysine

1018
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,760
it's critical epstein-barr is a herpetic

1019
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,040
family virus so it's a

1020
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,040
it's the herpes family that's what it is

1021
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,800
and a lot of people that have ebv also

1022
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,400
have simplex they got the fever blisters

1023
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,560
they got the shingles viruses they got

1024
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,960
hhv-6 they've got cytomegalovirus so

1025
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,720
lysine is critical it's critical to

1026
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,200
knock down that epstein-barr or anything

1027
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,119
else in the herpetic family

1028
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
that's another aspect that has to be

1029
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,240
there another piece

1030
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
by the way vimergy came out that

1031
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,359
elderberry syrup which is

1032
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
insane there's nothing like it out there

1033
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,599
i mean what's it's incredible it's only

1034
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,000
elderberry syrup that has a mulberry

1035
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,520
extract in there and vitamin c and a

1036
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
mulberry extract

1037
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,800
so that's something that's mind-blowing

1038
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,280
right there i just told a family member

1039
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,760
that for their kids they should be doing

1040
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,839
a couple of teaspoons every single day

1041
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,240
when they're not sick of the elderberry

1042
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,480
syrup as an immune system support right

1043
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,720
now now that we're going into all the

1044
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,720
flues all the that whole thing and we're

1045
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,960
going into that time time of the year

1046
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,040
through the winter in a lot of places so

1047
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,839
i got all my friends i got my family

1048
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,440
family members friends everybody i know

1049
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,040
i got them on the elderberry syrup like

1050
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,280
one teaspoon for maintenance every

1051
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,119
single day or twice a day two teaspoons

1052
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,640
their children one to two teaspoons

1053
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,640
right you ask your doctor what's right

1054
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,400
for you but that's what i have family

1055
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,960
and friends and that's great too and

1056
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,440
it's helpful for epstein-barr which is

1057
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,440
really incredible right

1058
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,359
so

1059
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,960
memory came out with a new product right

1060
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,480
here now it doesn't look like it's new

1061
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
because it's lemon balm so it's just

1062
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,560
like the lemon balm here but this is a

1063
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,680
10 to 1 ratio

1064
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,440
highly highly potent

1065
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,880
so if i had

1066
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,359
dizziness and vertigo and tinnitus and

1067
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,960
aches and pains and fatigue and anxiety

1068
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,200
and depression and anything else that

1069
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,040
was neurological

1070
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,560
i would be doing that one right there

1071
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,760
too so i would be doing the ten to one

1072
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,000
ratio as well it's really potent potent

1073
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
right so they just keep on upping their

1074
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,320
game

1075
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,240
all their stuff's incredible but they

1076
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,520
upped their game incredible for anything

1077
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,040
epstein barr

1078
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,200
amy batchelor

1079
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,720
all these supplements are wonderful easy

1080
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,560
to take and gentle on the gut they

1081
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,240
really are amy they really are gentle

1082
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,079
that's that's one of the greatest

1083
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,800
reasons why i love them

1084
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,440
i'm super sensitive and do well with all

1085
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,880
of them thank you anthony amy thanks

1086
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
you're the greatest

1087
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,839
bless your heart amy

1088
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,640
so

1089
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,200
low quality supplements gives

1090
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,760
good quality supplements a bad rap and a

1091
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,079
bad name so many people are burned so

1092
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,119
bad from the bad stuff that

1093
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,480
the low quality stuff ruins it for

1094
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,400
people

1095
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,960
because then they just won't even try

1096
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,520
the good stuff they won't even know

1097
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,720
john smith they went from four to one to

1098
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,880
ten to one and didn't raise the price

1099
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,040
and that's really something

1100
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,920
it is and the thing is with it i'm

1101
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,760
probably

1102
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,200
yeah i know they're probably hurting

1103
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,960
from that one too

1104
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,480
exactly but other companies they would

1105
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,480
just they would never do that other

1106
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,640
companies would never do that

1107
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,200
things with energy actually care and

1108
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,160
that's the difference they actually care

1109
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,280
you know

1110
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,720
so but the bottom line is this is one

1111
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,760
potent form

1112
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,800

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,760
got all these different problems i got

1133
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,480
numbness and i got tingles in weird

1134
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,599
places

1135
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,160
you know and they're like i'm like look

1136
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,440
get on the ten to one get on your your

1137
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,960
zinc get on your licorice

1138
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
okay all these things matter

1139
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,280
all these things matter

1140
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,680
tests for epstein-barr do not always

1141
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,520
show up so if you have the epstein-barr

1142
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,960
the test may not show up because the

1143
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,960
test tap because the epsilon bar

1144
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,839
technically has to be in the blood

1145
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,599
for it to really ring and pick off and

1146
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,920
then the virus loves to sit inside

1147
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
organs and hide out in the thyroid in

1148
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,000
different organs that's why it's really

1149
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,480
hard i explained that in detail of where

1150
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,520
the confusion is with epstein-barr

1151
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,520

1152
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,480
