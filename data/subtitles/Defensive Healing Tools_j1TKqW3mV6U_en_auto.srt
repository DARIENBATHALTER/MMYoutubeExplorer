breaks when somebody betrays us when

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,680
we're struggling emotionally when

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,760
someone misunderstands us when we feel

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,039
all bottled up we can't let it out when

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,039

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,599
information and it's Computing inside

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,160

adrenals if you guys just came on here

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,480

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,200
that we're going to be on the defensive

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,920
with our immune system protecting us CR

63
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,480
that we have immune system protectors we

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,640
get bad news we receive that bad news in

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,360
the brain obviously we hear it with our

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,040
ears those nerves go straight to the

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,159
brain the information gets there and

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,680
then the brain sends information to your

69
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,599
adrenals it sends information now to

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,360
your adrenals your adrenals then explode

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,840

adrenaline immune

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,080

betrayed when there's a trust issue

109
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,080
adrenaline is like poison to the immune

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,039
system and then we get that adrenaline

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,880

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,960

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,560
adrenaline is rushing into the

131
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,919
bloodstream right here and I'm going to

132
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,160
make another bloodstream over here too

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,639

134
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,319

right is that adrenaline is rushing in

136
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,720
here it is it's scorching the immune

137
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,039
cells so our immune system gets beaten

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,639
down by it it scorches the immune cells

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,880
okay it's a little immune cell right

140
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,120
there you guys can see it and adrenaline

141
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,000
tends to Scorch it we get bad news we

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,280
receive it right here in the

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,639
brain right information goes from the

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,520
brain into the brain stem out the nerves

145
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,840
out the cranial nerves heads out to the

146
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,720
adrenals the adrenals get a message

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,800
saying fight ORF flight fight or flight

148
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,919
fight or

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,880
flight and then the adrenals are dumping

150
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,080
adrenaline okay

151
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,039
and then that adrenaline goes right in

152
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,680
you know how many people get the flu

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
they get the flu during some kind of a

154
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,520
strange moment a strange time where

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
they're under pressure they're under

156
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,759
some kind of stress they're emotionally

157
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,240
going through something and then they're

158
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,080
just boom down with a flu you know how

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,919
many people get

160
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,560
mononucleosis because of something

161
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,759
they've gone through and ups and downs

162
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,280
breakups with relationships and then

163
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
they just hit the wall and they just

164
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,120
they have mono right how many people

165
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,240
have done that and maybe you're not just

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,919
up against the emotional stuff maybe

167
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,680
you're just wearing yourself out maybe

168
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,919
because you have no choice or whatever

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,440
it is but the emotional stuff is a big

170
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,840
deal because it floods that adrenaline

171
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,599
into the system the adrenaline gets in

172
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,479
there and it hits the immune cells so

173
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,800
here's how it works as the adrenaline's

174
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,360
going in it's scorching weak immune

175
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,720
cells so weak immune cells

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,639
explode weak immune cells explode

177
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,680
they do they die off so as all that

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,039
adrenaline goes through during that bad

179
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,039
news you got immune cells dying off now

180
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,919
and as those immune cells are dying off

181
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,479
it's

182
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,280
leaving space for

183
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,720
Invaders it's leaving space for

184
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,560
Invaders Elena says every time I am

185
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,639
severely stressed I get the flu happens

186
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,240
to a lot of people don't think it just

187
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,120
happens to you on that there are so many

188
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,520
people that when they get that stress

189
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,440
when they're under that kind of

190
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,599
emotional turmoil whatever it is what

191
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,039
happens is they get the flu or they get

192
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,400
you know something else or they get the

193
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,280
c or RSV or something like that so okay

194
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,039
so let's make some new immune cells

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,319
right here okay we got your immune cells

196
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,960
this is your bloodstream right here all

197
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,000
right there's a reason why I'm talking

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,000
about this we can help protect immune

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,879
cells we can also put things in us that

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,759
protect us in a lot of other ways but we

201
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,800
can protect our immune cells our immune

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,919
system there's a way to do it so when

203
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,760
we're going through ups and downs where

204
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,919
we are protected when we're going

205
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,000
through ups and downs if we're dealing

206
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
with any kind of psychological abuse any

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,480
kind of mental abuse any kind of serious

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,360
gaslighting we're up against any kind of

209
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,440
bullies that we're up against yep

210
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,079
anything like that any other difficult

211
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,160
um struggles at all we can protect our

212
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:04,320
immune cells so they don't get scorched

213
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,839
to death so they don't get scorched and

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,079
die quickly so immune cells get scorched

215
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,440
and die quickly what happens is when you

216
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,959
start protecting your immune cell your

217
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,640
immune system and you start putting

218
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,120
things inside of you that protect your

219
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,640
immune system you make your immune cells

220
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,839
strong you also help to produce more

221
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,760
immune cells and more immune cells so

222
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,440
over

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,200
here what you see right here okay

224
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,440
is I'm just putting this green right

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,959
here

226
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,800
okay that's bone mirrow all

227
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,600
right that's some bone marrow right

228
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,920
there there's some bone marrow might not

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,959
even be able to see that there's some

230
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,160
bone marrow all right maybe you guys

231
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,600
can't see

232
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,079
that okay immune

233
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,640
cells many of them get produced out of

234
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,440
the bone marrow your bones producing

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,279
immune cells you see this there's the

236
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,920
immune cells being produced out of your

237
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,680
bone

238
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,959
marrow as immune cells are being scored

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
and dying off from adrenaline shooting

240
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,519
into the

241
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:18,079
bloodstream okay your bones go into

242
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:21,560
overdrive to produce new immune

243
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,959
cells so those immune cells eventually

244
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,800
get back into the bloodstream like right

245
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,000
here all

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,440
right what happens when we go through a

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,360
mar emotional hardships we lose sleep we

248
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,480
don't sleep good we're under emotional

249
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,639
turmoil we don't get a lot of sleep our

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,959
immune system tends to drop it loses a

251
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,839
lot of its strength okay that's why I

252
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,160
like to tell family you got to be on the

253
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,519
propolis every day is maintenance not

254
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,200
just when you catch something or you got

255
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,120
a cold sore okay or you got a canker

256
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,519
sore or something like that it's about

257
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,279
maintenance because you don't know when

258
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,240
you're going to get whacked you don't

259
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,760
know that's how it works when we're up

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,399
against different things and we're up

261
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,600
against different turmoil our emotional

262
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
struggles it comes and goes it's like a

263
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,320
roller coaster ride right why do you

264
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,200
think people say relationships are like

265
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
roller coaster rides a lot of people

266
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,240
have said that over the years right

267
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
where it's like you're going up and then

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,760
you're going down relationships some

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,959
relationships could be just friendships

270
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,600
could be like everything's going great

271
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,320
everything's going great and everybody's

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,959
going up great up up up they're all

273
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,200
going up and then they're at the top

274
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,959
there and all of a sudden something

275
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,920
plateaus and somebody says something

276
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,800
stupid and

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,040
then everybody's going down like

278
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,760
that and then they go back oh we're

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,639
making up we're making up friends

280
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,399
friends are making up things seem to be

281
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
okay status quo everything's okay

282
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,800
balance them you're going up there all

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
of a sudden plateauing something says

284
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,360
somebody says something terrible

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
something happens and everybody's going

286
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,680
to scream I hate you I hate you and

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,079
they're down here that roller coaster

288
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,839
ride

289
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,480
is really difficult on the immune system

290
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,079
that's why maintenance is critical Bri

291
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,000

292
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,279

they're living on cat's claw because of

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,839

333
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,600
of bugs throughout their life and

334
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,199
they've got a lot of exposures their

335
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,959
immune system was up against a lot and

336
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,759
they actually have to be on cat's claw

337
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,160
every day to to keep them stable they

338
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,320

344
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
them taking the cat's claw and they got

345
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,519
to be on cat's claw I know people that

346
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,959

347
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,759
every day to keep that immune Health

349
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,279
back to it a little bit you guys right

350
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,199
here I got propolis I'll talk a a little

351
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,959
bit about that I got the cats claw right

352
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,399
here and then total immune those three

353
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,639
are from viy that's the brand I trust

354
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,560
and there's a reason because guess what

355
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,360
when everybody had alcohol and all their

356
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,639
crap they didn't people have all these

357
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,759
percentages of undisclosed ingredients

358
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,040
you don't know about in all their

359
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,959
supplements they won't do that it's

360
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,279
incredible really anyway so let's go to

361
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,160
you got your bloodstream here you got

362
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,199
your bloodstream here adrenaline rushing

363
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,160
in here comes the adrenaline it's

364
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:03,320
rushing in right you were given some bad

365
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,120
news maybe you're going through some

366
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,600
mental abuse maybe just anything you're

367
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,720
having a bad day maybe you're nervous

368
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,040
about something and you're worried and

369
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,920
then those adrenals are releasing

370
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,800
adrenaline the adrenaline is getting

371
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,279
sucked right up into the veins and

372
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,079
arteries and getting in there and then

373
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,279
it's hitting the immune cells it's

374
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,000
hitting the immune cells right here so

375
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,839
you got the adrenaline hitting the

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,440

there and here's the adrenaline rushing

378
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,600
the adrenaline rushes and boom hits the

379
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,759
immune cell right there the immune cell

380
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,360
weakens because that's fight or flight

381
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,519
adrenaline it's corrosive it's Burns see

382
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,920
that right there you got an immune cell

383
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,519

cell takes a hit and it gets scorched

388
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,560
okay now there's a lot of immune cells

389
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,000
you have in your body that will sustain

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,199
they will be able to sustain the

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,959
scorching but there are a lot of immune

392
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,800
cells different varieties of immune

393
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,399
cells that don't

394
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,560
sustain they don't and then overdrive

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,199
cells producing where do those immune

405
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,839
cells go they go right into the

406
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,240

experience you're up against new

410
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,720
emotional trouble okay once again here

411
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,399
comes the adrenaline rushing in here it

412
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,319
go goes and it's hitting these immune

413
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,919
cells adrenaline hits these immune cells

414
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,280
okay and that's why maintenance is

415
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:13,720
critical you guys maintenance is

416
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,120
critical you can go through something

417
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,720
that seems mild to someone else someone

418
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,880
could get into a really bad car crash

419
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,640
they're in life support for a month they

420
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,480
come out they recover they're still in

421
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,799
bad shape nothing seems to bug them

422
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,240
anymore

423
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,559
after what they went through okay in

424
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
that car

425
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,000
crash and and so it takes a lot to maybe

426
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
really shake them up because they've

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,799
been there they've been in that car

428
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,600
crash and then you take somebody who it

429
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,640
seems like everything is good there's

430
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,200
silver spoonfed everything's happy and

431
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,000
then little things get to them little

432
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,720
things because they seeming seemingly

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,360
have a protective cushy life and then

434
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,840
little things like my friend just called

435
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,240
me an [ __ ] and they Shake they're

436
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,520
shaking over it they're so pissed at

437
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,320
this one friend meanwhile that person

438
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,799
who got to a car crash they're on life

439
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,640
support for a month that's a joke to

440
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,480
them that's a joke but either whether

441
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,559
it's small or large what happens is your

442
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,240
adrenaline can still rush into your

443
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,840
bloodstream all the same that's the

444
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,640
point I'm trying to make right here you

445
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,039
can have somebody where life is going

446
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,919
good I'm not going through any real

447
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,200
trauma but then they're getting really

448
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,679
upset over little things if it isn't

449
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,240
just right and I understand that

450
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,240
situation too because then that goes

451
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,840
into also some OCD as well and then that

452
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,919
could be really triggering too but

453
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,520
either way adrenaline can Rush In on

454
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,840
what someone might think is a really

455
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,799
small thing and somebody might think is

456
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,520
a really big thing right I got so Terry

457
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,799

458
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,640

don't know what else to do and they're

554
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,039
just bombarding their patients with

555
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,440
those heavy heavy

556
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,320
antibiotics and over time because of the

557
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,320
medical medium books and lectures

558
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,000

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,440
off just like

737
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,039
that and that's how it works every day

738
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,159
people's immune systems are struggling

739
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,760
and then what happens is all of a sudden

740
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,679
that's right all of a

741
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,200
sudden an Invader comes in you just got

742
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,159
exposed to the flu you're down and out

743
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,000
you got all this chemical exposure it's

744
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,600
in your bloodstream it's knocking out

745
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,880
immune cells and then just by chance do

746
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,039
you want to call it happen stance do you

747
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,039
want to call it by luck do you want to

748
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,279
call it just bummer luck you get exposed

749
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,960
to a flu here you go right there and now

750
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,519
you got a flu bug right there you just

751
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,320
got exposed you were somewhere and you

752
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,000
got exposed you took a nice deep breath

753
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,440
at a yoga

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
class nice deep breath in a yoga

755
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,320
class and everybody went breathe in and

756
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,200
everybody was breathing in and the flu

757
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,960
virus was floating around in that little

758
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,320
room and everybody was exhaling and then

759
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,519
you're breathing in and now between the

760
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,000
chemical exposure and the adrenaline

761
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,320
exposure and then you bring in that flu

762
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,120
bug now you're in the flu bug mode it

763
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,799
gets into the bloodstream and now you

764
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,519
got the flu bug in your bloodstream and

765
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,519
guess what your immune system is

766
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,679
weakened so the flu kicks your butt

767
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,480
you're coughing your guts out it's

768
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,480
getting into your

769
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,279
lungs and then you hear about everything

770
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,120
else happening to people these days the

771
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,360
amount of stuff people are going through

772
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,880
with their health because their immune

773
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,240
systems are down we have to do

774
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:58,840
maintenance we have to do defensive

775
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,559
maintenance it is critical at this time

776
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,200

mouth propolis they got to be on

856
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,200
propolis after you come back from the

857
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,720
dentist you're taking propolis and

858
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,760
you're taking it every single day for a

859
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,240
while a so you don't catch a flu or

860
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,599
something else what happens in the

861
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,960
dentist office it's easy to catch a lot

862
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,000
of different bugs from the drills and

863
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,200
the tools things because of people

864
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,359
touching things like the lamp the light

865
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,839
because they're touching this they're

866
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,880
touching that what I tell friends and

867
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:42,200
family you tell the dentist or the or

868
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,560
the the hygienist you tell them to

869
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,320
change out their gloves because they're

870
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,119
putting gloves on but they're putting

871
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,520
gloves on to protect their hands from

872
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,319
you they're protecting themselves from

873
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,640
you they're not putting gloves on

874
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:57,280
technically to protect you when they

875
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,560
have their hands in your mouth they're

876
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,920
putting gloves on to protect themselves

877
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,680
from you keep that in mind so what

878
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,720
happens is they're touching everything

879
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,240
they're doing this and that and I I I'll

880
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
tell family you tell them to change

881
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,680
their gloves a couple of times

882
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,319
throughout the process if they're like

883
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,960
well they're 50 cents a glove you pay

884
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,200
for it you pay for it anyway that's the

885
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
propolis after dental work after oral

886
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,960
work any kind of stuff like that oral

887
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,640
surgery I mean ask your dentist what's

888
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,920
right for you but I tell friends and

889
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,400
family you got to be on propolis you got

890
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,880
to be on

891
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,720
propolis is is it okay to

892
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,160
take wild the blueberry is shot right

893
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,880
after yes it is

894
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,319
definitely it's what I would

895
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,240
do okay so we're going into propolis a

896
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:46,119
little bit we're going into cat's

897
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:50,000
claw so what I love about cat's Claw is

898
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:54,560
it's like an immune system

899
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,920
modulator so it doesn't tend to wear off

900
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,319
it won't wear off your system doesn't

901
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,160
get used to it right because you're on

902
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:09,160
it every day it's a immune system

903
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,000
enhancer but modulator keeps everything

904
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,839
balanced so it's like that defensive

905
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,599
nature keeping things balanced it's what

906
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,040
I love about cat's claw all right and so

907
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,200
many people they're up against so much

908
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,800
out there I mean you guys see it out

909
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,079
there like everything from autoimmune

910
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,680
Under the Sun so many people are dealing

911
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,240
with stuff all that is immune system

912
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,560
that's how it

913
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,560
works because that's what went

914
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,240
wrong something had to have gone wrong

915
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,599
first if they got viral or they got any

916
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,200
kind of pathogens or any kind of bugs

917
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,440
it's because their immune system wasn't

918
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,560
handling it properly if they're sick and

919
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,119
they got all kinds of different

920
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,400
conditions that's because their immune

921
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,800
system is struggling you see how it

922
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,280
works you guys Hill over there on

923
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,240
YouTube says vimer pure propolis was a

924
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,040
huge game Cher for me with my head in

925
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,440

does aw think about this what does a aw

929
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:15,040
think about doing this and and I sound

930
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,560
like a broken record I'm like propolis

931
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,000
propolis why are you not on the propolis

932
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,319
the stuff is is god-given gifted

933
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,760
Heavenly scent it is unbelievable it's

934
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:30,040
the combination of Supernatural Mother

935
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,319
Nature Supernatural God it's a

936
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,720
combination of all of that to be in our

937
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,720
hands right now in this day and

938
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,160
age and you got to think about something

939
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,079
like with the propolis you got the bees

940
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,720
Gathering nectar and and and right

941
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,480
pollen from so many different species so

942
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,119
many different flowers from so many

943
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,960
different species with all kinds of

944
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,359
hundreds of micronutrients like hundreds

945
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,760
of phytochemical compounds per species

946
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:01,839
right and they're all bringing that

947
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,440
back right and then they spackle up some

948
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,400
propolis the bees spackle up some

949
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,560
propolis they use it as a protected

950
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,000
inside the hive to glue the hive

951
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,400
together but it's also antiseptic right

952
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,599
it's a protected it's like the protector

953
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,640
the defense mechanism for the Beehive

954
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,119
it's

955
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,119
incredible and vimergy does it in such a

956
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,440
way they use a process that is so clean

957
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,760
and so pure and so good for the bees

958
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,680
that I can't trust anybody's propolis

959
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,560
out there there's no way I can't I can't

960
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,599
thumbs up for the best it is the best

961
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,359
stuff so you guys we're talking about

962
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,880
the immune system we're talking about

963
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,480
all that let me just clear the board for

964
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,760
another second you guys have another few

965
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,599
minutes to learn some

966
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,000
stuff you guys up for that at all you

967
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,000
guys got you guys got a couple more

968
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,400
minutes all right we just clear this

969
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,400
board off a little bit

970
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,440
all

971
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:09,079
right we're back okay all right

972
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,960
bloodstream again bloodstream there you

973
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,200
go

974
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,000
okay all

975
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,800
right immune

976
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,280
cells yep there they

977
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,000
are immune cells you know what their job

978
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,040
is your immune cells their job is to

979
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,800
collect debris get ready

980
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,599
that's right everybody's bloodstream

981
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,280
ends up getting dirty dirty blood

982
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,280
Syndrome from debris so what kind of

983
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,880
debris are we talking about we're

984
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,480
talking about everything from plaque

985
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,400
From Plaque

986
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,440
deposits even younger people we're

987
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,960
talking about toxic

988
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,760
calcium yeah toxic

989
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,960
calcium building up in here we're

990
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,520
talking about debris solids it's called

991
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,599
our bloodstream is not supposed to be

992
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,480
filled up entirely with solids it's only

993
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,280
supposed to be partial solids in the

994
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,560
form of micro minerals macrominerals

995
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,680
trace minerals but our bloodstreams get

996
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,440
dirty because of our stagnant livers and

997
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,040
when our bloodstream gets dirty from our

998
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,520
stagnant livers solids

999
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,040
accumulate and when they do your IM

1000
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,520
immune system jumps on them you know why

1001
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,200
your immune system jumps on the solids

1002
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,079
do you know why because it has to go and

1003
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,000
break it down and eat it that's what it

1004
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,880
has to do our bloodstream gets filled

1005
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,280
with solids that aren't supposed to be

1006
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,440
there and then our immune system has to

1007
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,720
gobble it up and consume it and eat it

1008
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,760
and guess what happens to our immune

1009
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,119
system it weakens every day our immune

1010
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,520
system

1011
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,560
weakens and then it dies it dies off in

1012
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,560
our bloodstream and then once again you

1013
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,599
got your marrow over here your bone

1014
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,359
marrow it's overdrive your bone marrow

1015
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:08,160
is an overdrive trying to produce immune

1016
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:11,880
cells to eat up solids that's

1017
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,680
right dirty blood syndrome beats down

1018
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,839
the immune cells we have to protect our

1019
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,280
immune cells it is critical that's why

1020
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,640
what I believe in from what Spirit of

1021
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,640
compassion has taught me throughout my

1022
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,480
life is you got to have a maintenance

1023
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,880
immune system plann you have to have it

1024
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,760
everyday

1025
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,160
a maintenance immune system plan that's

1026
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,640
what we have to that's what we have to

1027
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,760
okay put something up there in the

1028
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,839
tech it's critical for people to

1029
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,760
understand this maintenance is critical

1030
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,950
big piece of it all on its own all right

1031
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,760
so let's

1032
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,960
[Music]

1033
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,960
go all

1034
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,240
right lymphatic system how many of you

1035
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,640
guys are in into the lymphatic system

1036
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,920
okay that's your

1037
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,480
lymphocytes lymphocyte production

1038
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,000
lymphatic system okay everybody's trying

1039
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,359
to drain their lymphatic system

1040
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,839
everybody's trying to get lymphatic

1041
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,839
drainage everybody's talking about their

1042
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,400
lymphatic system everybody's talking

1043
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,920
about lymphatic drainage there's tools

1044
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,680
out there trying to drain people's

1045
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,359
lymphatic systems but guess what they're

1046
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,880
not talking about they're not talking

1047
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,880
about how to keep your lymphocytes

1048
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,920
strong

1049
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,079
you can play with your lymphatic system

1050
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,640
all day

1051
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,200
long and if you don't clean up the liver

1052
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,400
and the liver stagnant and sluggish the

1053
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,079
lymphatic system blows right up the next

1054
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,240
day or or three hours later do you ever

1055
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,920
see that when someone comes out of

1056
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,800
lymphatic drainage massage but at the

1057
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,680
end of the day they're like this

1058
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,200
again just spend $300 and I'm like this

1059
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,000
again okay I better go back tomorrow and

1060
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,280
do it all over again because their liver

1061
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,720
is stagnant and sluggish they're not

1062
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,839
addressing the liver so they're

1063
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,119
constantly battling the lymphatic system

1064
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,760
but let's talk about the most important

1065
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,640
part about this lymphatic system means

1066
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,520
lymphocytes those babies are a part of

1067
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:14,480
your immune system and what happens is

1068
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:18,200
with lymphocytes they die easy they die

1069
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,200
easy and lymphocyte production becomes

1070
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,520
minimalized because at some point in

1071
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,520
your life it was maximized and it was

1072
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,559
just boom lots of lymphocytes everywhere

1073
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,000
and then slowly over time they were

1074
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,240
broken down they're dying they're beaten

1075
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,960
down and your production is not as

1076
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,760
strong as it was in the

1077
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,440
past and so we need maintenance on

1078
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,559
lymphocytes maintenance to support your

1079
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,920
lymphocytes big piece of how to

1080
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,599
heal I don't talk about the lymphatic

1081
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,880
system every day because I talk about

1082
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,680
the liver the very thing that makes it

1083
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,480
so your lymphatic system gets dirty to

1084
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,480
begin with I don't like doing the

1085
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,200
topical crap I like going to the root

1086
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,119
cause down to really what's going on

1087
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,640
what's causing things if you don't clean

1088
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,040
up your liver your lympha you're going

1089
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,200
to be chasing after your lymphatic

1090
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:07,280
system the rest of your life you are if

1091
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,960
you don't clean that sluggish stagnant

1092
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,960
toxic liver up you're going to be

1093
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,440
chasing after your lymphatic system

1094
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,040
rainbows you're going to be chasing your

1095
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,599
tail chasing your tail chasing your tail

1096
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,200
but one thing people don't realize

1097
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,319
overall with the lymphatic system it's

1098
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,119
the lymphocytes we got to keep those

1099
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:25,000
strong and if you don't do maintenance

1119
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,319

1120
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,040

and they're

1129
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,280
struggling they're struggling with

1130
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,359
something that they're battling if we

1131
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,000
don't do maintenance we can't protect

1132
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:40,040
our lymphatic system the lymphocytes in

1133
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,680
our lymphatic system and so what I tell

1134
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,319
friends and family if you're not doing a

1135
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,040
maintenance plan then what are you

1136
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:47,319
really doing for your lymphatics so well

1137
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,240
I'm getting lymphatic drainage three

1138
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:51,040
times you know a week that's what I'm

1139
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,800
doing but are you protecting your

1140
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,200
lymphatics immune system because if

1141
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,520
you're not protecting that then you're

1142
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,119
not truly really protecting

1143
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,280
yourself if you're not protecting your

1144
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,079
lymphocytes if you're not doing that

1145
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,400
then you're not really protecting

1146
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,440
yourself and then what what do I do what

1147
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,319
do I do prop list I told you about the

1148
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,920
prop list oh that's right I didn't order

1149
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:17,839

1150
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,480
propolis critical to be on some kind of

1151
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:24,000

00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,000

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,599
with the thyme and the Mullen which you

1222
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:04,480
propolis pure right there like I said I

1223
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:06,880
know people they never saw a mouth ulcer

1224
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,000
again canker stur were the size of

1225
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,680
quarters and dimes in their throat the

1226
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,559
doctors were like kerur were in their

1227
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,880

insane and then you got the cat's claw

1229
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,040
right there and I got friends and family

1230
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,920
doing the maintenance doing the

1231
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,880
maintenance that's why I support these

1232
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,880
guys it's the best stuff there is out

1233
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,440
there that's why I support these guys

1234
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,119
there isn't like 20 things in here where

1235
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,559
you're getting ripped off with a little

1236
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,920
bit of this and a little bit of that and

1237
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,119
a little bit of seamos and a little bit

1238
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,359
of this and a little bit of this and a

1239
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,799
little bit of this and you can't get

1240
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,559
better because it's 20 30 things in a

1241
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:47,440
bottle and all cheap ingredients all

1242
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,319
mixed up in there and your body's like I

don't even know what you're taking it's

1244
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:54,040
different when you go Powerhouse and

1245
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:55,720
you're taking that cat's claw direct and

1246
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,880
you're taking that propolis direct and

1247
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,160
you're taking that total immune direct

1248
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,359
there's a big difference than 50 things

1249
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,400
in one container cuz somebody comes up

1250
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,760

1251
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,040
this stuff in here a little bit of this

1252
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,839

1253
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,520

1254
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,799
like this and it's like in this form

I do I have family members that do both

1280
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,319

that's got the time and the Mullen

1292
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:45,160

1294
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,559
the rundown on how it works with the

1295
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,079
adrenaline how it works with the with

1296
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,880
the immune system and what we're trying

1297
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,839
to

1298
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:59,720
do what's the point what's the point

1299
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,880
seriously what is the point if we can't

1300
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,920
take

1301
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:08,520
care of our immune system and we're just

1302
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,119
being dragged down by sickness because

1303
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,000
we can't keep our immune system stable

1304
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,000
long enough even when people do a little

1305
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,119
something for their immune system and

1306
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,680
whether they know they're doing it or

1307
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,720
not they do a little something for their

1308
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,079
immune system but what if what if they

1309
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,520
did a lot for their immune system and

1310
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,920
longterm like a maintenance where it's

1311
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,480
long term where all of a sudden 6 months

1312
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:35,440
later the symptom goes away 8 months

1313
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,440
later the symptom goes away four months

1314
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,720
later wait a minute I can't believe it

1315
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,200
but I forgot about that symptom I used

1316
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,640

with vimergy they know what it's like

when they're taking vmer and they know

1338
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:30,839
that difference when they take other

1339
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,920
things versus other things and they know

1340
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:35,200
the

1341
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,200
difference they understand it they know

1342
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,319
it yep what brand uh people everybody's

1343
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,040
asking what brand it's vimergy okay

1344
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,559
these in Victor I am is and Mary E RG y

1345
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,880
That's a propolis pure right there these

1346
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,680
three supplements but you guys it

1347
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,920
matters you know why I support them too

1348
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,240
you know why I actually support BG

1349
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,280
because there's nothing like this on the

1350
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,319
planet and I don't want it to go away I

1351
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,319
don't want it to go away

1352
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:02,920
because if it goes away and I think

1353
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,559
about the loss of people's like

1354
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,760
opportunities to heal and to move

1355
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:10,839
forward and protect themselves that

1356
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,599
right there that that just really is sad

1357
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:14,680
anyway it's one of the reasons why I

1358
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,520
also support him because when

1359
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,040
something's this good you don't want to

1360
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,400
lose it you don't want to lose it that's

1361
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,680
true you guys check out medical meem
