different issue going on different like

275
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,079
toxic load somebody else might have more

276
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,279
petrochemicals because they had gas

277
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,040

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,279
mowing the lawn 10 years ago somebody

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,320

280
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,160
liver inside their body somebody may

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
have more pharmace euticals inside their

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
body from taking a lot of

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,360
pharmaceuticals to you know and that

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,639
happens too and so there's some people

285
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,040
that have a lot of anti-depressants

286
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,399
sitting in their liver and other parts

287
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,120
of the body some people have um a lot of

288
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,320
antibiotics they took them for years

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
that's sitting in there so you got to

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,120
always keep in mind that everybody's

291
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,200

people and making sure they're getting

413
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:13,000
to where they go and I've seen people

414
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,800
who walked into my office okay with

415
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,320
walking sticks and braces on their legs

walking sticks braces on their legs or

417
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,040
being wheeled into my office I've even

418
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:29,279
seen situations where I've seen people

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,600
carried into my office over the decades

420
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,720
and uh and and I'm telling you the power

421
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,160
is unbelievable about what can happen

422
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,800
when you get fruits and vegetables and

423
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,560
the right kinds of fruits and vegetables

424
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,800
in your diet the power the power is is

425
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,800
is is you know just amazing it is and

that's what I'm talking about and that's

427
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,199
what matters that's what

428
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,360
matters and so you take it one day at a

429
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,759
time it's not to be scary it's not to be

430
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
like frightening when you hear about a

431
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,199
cleanse when you hear about what can I

432
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,959
do to change my diet you know that's

433
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,720
that's it's more than that it's better

434
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,839
than that it's better than any of that

435
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,639
there's nothing scary about it if you

436
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,600
can only do it for one week then you do

437
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,360
it for one week if that's all you can do

438
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,120
and you do it one week at a time then

439
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,360
hey I'm doing the 28 day cleanse I'm

440
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,319
doing it 7 days because you know what's

441
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,399
going to happen you're going to end up

442
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,240
doing it two weeks someday you might

443
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,560
even end up doing two weeks after your

444
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,920
one week so you go so you go two weeks

445
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,720
two

446
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,440
weeks and um and that matters and you

447
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,600
might even go three weeks you might even

448
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,120
go four weeks so think about that and

449
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
that's what used to happen I remember

450
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,680
years and years and years ago and over

451
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,079
the years I remember people coming into

452
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,399
the office and I've watched what the

453
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:53,160

cleanse has done for them I have watched

455
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,800

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
even believe that people are

457
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,839
experiencing now all over the world

458
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,240
world but I've seen things you wouldn't

459
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,120
even believe and that's what I'm talking

460
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,120
about quite quite an amazing amazing

461
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,679
amazing story that goes on out there

462
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,480
with people's healing in their body and

463
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,400
what they can do had people that have

464
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,240
done the 28 day cleanse for 6 months in

465
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,039

468
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,319
cleanse for 3 months got them out of the

469
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,919
worst cases of Xmen psoriasis where

470
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,839
their body was just riddled with Xmen

471
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,160
psoriasis I mean yeah I've seen the 28

472
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,760
day cleanse

473
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,400
turn people's neurological systems

474
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,000
around so they could start talking again

475
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
functioning again getting out of bed

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
dropping the fatigue I've seen the

477
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,520
28-day cleanse turn lives around like no

478
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,080
other over the years and the decades

479
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,240
I've seen people walking in with the

480
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,799
worst cases of neurological lime

481
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,160
starting their 28 day cleanse at home

482
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,760
doing it for a year and then getting

483
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,280
stronger than they ever have there's

484
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,720
people now that are 75 80 85 years old

485
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,440

they never turned back they never turned

488
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,840
back and I'm saying that that's the

489
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,400
power of the body that's the power of

490
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,960
the body and what the body can do it's

491
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,600
quite extraordinary and quite unique

492
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,799

vegetables in their raw form and that

525
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,440

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,200
actually terrifying for some it's not

529
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,320

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,720
believe it and you know what happened

543
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,280
they ended up going 8 Days 9 days 10

544
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,159
days because they're getting results 11

545
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,559
Days 12 days 13 days 14 days 15 days

546
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,039
next thing you know it they're in their

547
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,000
third week next thing you know it you're

548
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,880
in your fourth week it's like that's

549
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,679
what I mean hey do it for three days you

550
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,559
might end up at seven

551
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,960
days that's what you that's okay there's

552
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,559
nothing wrong with that if that's what

553
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,240
you got to do I'll do it with you so

554
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,039
it's really important so the deal is

555
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,960
your body doesn't have to process any

556
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,559
cooked food your body doesn't have to

557
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,400
process any cooked food which actually

558
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,000
is a little bit more of a burden on the

559
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,280
body sometimes than raw food is that's

560
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,320
the whole point the raw foods filled

561
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,559
with all the enzymes all the fresh

562
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,760
enzymes and living enzymes it does help

563
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,799
digestion there's no question about it

564
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,799
so even if you're you're doing paleo why

565
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:57,200
would you eat salads if you're doing

566
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,640
paleo if you're doing high protein diet

567
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,039
why bother eating salads just eat meat

568
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,120
three times a day just eat meat five

569
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:04,320
times a day never touch a vegetable you

570
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,919
touch a salad because salads have those

571
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,360
living enzymes in them you touch a salad

572
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,960
because it actually helps your animal

573
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,760
protein digest there's nothing wrong

574
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,880
with that and when your liver gets

575
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,360
stronger and stronger and stronger

576
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,600
because you do say a 28 day cleanse

577
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,039
where it's all raw fruits and vegetables

578
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,400
and that's all it is raw fruits and

579
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,240
vegetables there's no Meats there's no

580
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,640
Dairy there's no there's no eggs of

581
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,200
course there's no fish but when you're

582
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,039
doing that and your liver starts

583
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,279
building up and your liver starts

584
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,840
getting stronger and next thing know

585
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,320
your bile production gets stronger it

586
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,360
gets increased it gets more powerful

587
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,679
next thing you know your hydrochloric

588
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,799
acid in your stomach gets stronger and

589
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,679
stronger and stronger and that gets

590
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,360
increased and now you're able to digest

591
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,960
better and better so when you bring on

592
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,960
your vegetarian diet and you happen have

593
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,919
fish in there you're breaking that stuff

594
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,279
down better you bring on your paleo diet

595
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,760
you bring on your animal protein diet

596
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,039
whatever fancy name is on the animal

597
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,520
protein diet and next thing you know it

598
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,240
you're actually breaking down the animal

599
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,480
protein better than you ever did before

600
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,480
the 28d cleanse is not just a vegan

601
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,799
thing it's not just a plant-based thing

602
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,000
it yes it's raw fruits and vegetables so

603
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,960
it is raw plant-based but it's not about

604
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,320
that if you're into doing the high

605
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,880
animal protein what you're doing is

606
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
you're getting a reboot you're rebooting

607
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,279
your liver you're actually redirecting

608
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
your liver you're actually giving it a

609
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,279
chance to recover you're actually bring

610
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,080
it around and then you're also doing the

611
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,840
same for your HCL and your hydrochloric

612
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,120
acid you're actually bringing that

613
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,600
around and what's Happening Here is

614
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,799
you're making it so yeah you want to

615
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,559

620
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,120
you're going to have more actually more

621
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,720
steam in the engine you're going to have

622
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,480
more steam in The Liver More Steam in

623
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,080
other places it's going to be remarkable

624
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,400
it's going to be remarkable think about

625
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,799
that think about the power of that it

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,600
matters that

627
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:56,360
much it matters that much all of it so

628
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,679
if you're totally into some diet of any

629
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,760

guess what's going to happen you're

668
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,520
going to be able to ma maximize that

669
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,039
diet better you might start digesting

670
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,360
those trans fatty acids that are in the

671
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,559
fried oil you might start digesting that

672
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,440
lard grease from this fried you know

673
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,720
from like whatever the fried eggs and

674
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
and and some Diner somewhere and the

675
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,960
bacon grease and everything else you

676
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,919
might be able to digest it better but

677
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,480
you know what I'm trying to say you want

678
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,159
to go to healthier diets you don't want

679
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,559
to go to that diet but that's what I'm

680
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,399
trying to say is in general is that if

681
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,440
you're into like a good diet like say

682
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,120
you're into a healthy paleo diet right

683
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,760
say you're into a healthy ketogenic diet

684
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm not a fan of ketogenic diets I have

685
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,279
to be honest say say you're you know

686
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,080
you're a fan of what whatever it is

687
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,799
vegetarian or however it is or all

688
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,880
cooked or whatever an all cooked diet if

689
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,039
you're a fan of all these this can get

690
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,080
you to a place to maximize your

691
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,799
bioproduction so you can break down and

692
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,399
get the nutrients out of all those other

693
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,320
diets that you live for or that you love

694
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:15,679
or that you were told is the best for

695
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,679
you and they seem to be healthy because

696
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,960
they have no processed food no processed

697
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
foods in there and they seem to be

698
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,080
healthy because they have no no junk in

699
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,360
there and all this other stuff so hey

700
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,360
but you can maximize and get all the

701
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,720
nutrients out of those Foods that you

702
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,480
wouldn't normally get out of it before

703
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
unless you did the 28-day cleanse

704
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,520
because the 28-day cleanse is

705
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,720
reestablishing your liver for the first

706
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,120
time and probably your whole life the

707
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,320
20day cleanse is rebuilding your

708
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,200
hydrochloric acid faster and better than

709
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,039
anything could better than any HCL

710
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,039
supplement which doesn't work and never

711
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:52,480
worked for

712
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,240
anybody think about that so now you can

713
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,039
go hey I really believe in in this

714
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
trendy diet I always have I've been on

715
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,960
it but now you're going going to

716
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
maximize the nutrients in that trendy

717
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,000
diet that you like you're going to

718
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,679
actually get more out of the diet that

719
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,679
you like or whatever like you like and

720
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,799
you if you don't want to go to your

759
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,799
of illnesses who tried all the different

760
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,960
trendy diets of all them the elimination

761
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,240
diets everything last one this is this

762
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,159
is one of those things those tools that

763
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,159
Spirit gave me a long time ago when I

764
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,320
was a kid that actually got people out

765
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,559
of the worst trouble in the worst jams

766
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,679
and because it has the power to do so it

767
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,360
has the power to do so but you got to

768
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,760
work with it and you got to start with

769
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,279
it and you got to see where you can go

770
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,840
with it maybe you can do it for a week

771
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,480
maybe you can do it for 6 months

772
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,519
depending on what condition you have

773
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
I've seen people where they're just

774
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,000
Gravely ill and it took four years of

775
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,320
doing it but they were Gravely ill for

776
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,440
20 years and the four years they did it

777
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,880
straight consecutively got them right

778
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,679
out of the woods they lived their life

779
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,159
for the first time ever in year and

780
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,600
decades but either way some people it's

781
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,080
fast some people it's slower some people

782
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,919
they instantly start feeling better hey

783
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,559
oh my God I'm not Les I'm less achy I'm

784

00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,840
all the time like oh my God my digestion

787
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,360

the 28 day cleans let me just see if I

814
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,200
can take a couple of days out of 28 day

815
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,480
cleanse and get my family member to do

816
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,919
it a little bit let me just see if I can

817
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,480
get somebody to do the celery juice out

818
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,279
of the 28 day cleanse the original

819
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,279
original source of celery juice by

820
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,440
itself is in book one medical medium

821
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,799
28-day cleanse it's in the book that's

822
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,240
the original source and before that

823
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,760
there were other original sources that I

824
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,679
put out there going back teaching people

825
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,000
how to do Straight celery juice and

826
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
being the only source for that and the

827
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,120
reason why is cuz Spirit knew what

828
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,039
helped people heal and how to get them

829
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,720
healed and how to get them better and

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,360
how to give them a chance in a break in

831
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,799
life when all seemed lost and hopeless

832
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,559
and all seemed down and they weren't

833
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,519
getting the right information that

834
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,679
celery juice has been the miracle the

835
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,320
miracle along the way and it's in this

836
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:14,279
book for a reason Spirit wanted it in

837
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,120
this book it wasn't just for me helping

838
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,640

chopped scallions these are some of the

1025
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,480
things you can do that spinach soup if

1026
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,960
you eat it every day the things that it

1027
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,839
can do for you people say oh I eat

1028
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,839
spinach I eat spinach that's what people

1029
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,280
say they'll be like oh I eat

1030
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,920
spinach that's what they'll do I'll eat

1031
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,760
spinach

1032
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,200
and and and I'll say really what what

1033
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,920
what what do you mean tell me about it

1034
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,319
okay well I had some spinach I I think I

1035
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,520
had some spinach on my salad it was

1036
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,359
mixed in in the greens it was last week

1037
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm like okay the difference here when

1038
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,560
you're doing the creamy spinach soup the

1039
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,599
raw spinach soup every single night for

1040
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
a little while and you can change it off

1041
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,760
if we want to do modifications and I'll

1042
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,079
talk about that in a minute but every

1043
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,760
night what it can do is UN it's it's

1044
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,040
unimaginable actually because what what

1045
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,200
happens is I've seen it turn people

1046
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,599
around conditions you can't even believe

1047
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,480
skin conditions acne I mean it's just

1048
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,280
it's endless I've seen people with eye

1049
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,720
problems start to disappear because

1050
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,359
they're doing the spinach soup the kotes

1051
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,079
literally the spinach the power and the

1052
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,480
vitamins and spinach to that degree

1053
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,319
blend it up so your body digests it so

1054
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,079
easy including all the different enzymes

1055
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:23,440
that are in it it's really that amazing

1056
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
and the thing is you're not adding in

1057
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,319
all these bad foods cuz people will say

1058
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,359
well I had spinach with something else I

1059
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:32,960
had spinach with my whatever and that

1060
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,560
whatever wasn't that great it was

1061
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,119
burdening the liver giving people

1062
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,119
problems it was giving them have a hard

1063
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,400
time they weren't able to heal remember

1064
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,280
this is about clearing the air giving

1065
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,160
you some Freedom getting you better so

1066
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,040
you can actually do this and heal that's

1067
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,079
what this is all about very

1068
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,560
important so moving into the evening if

1069
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,200
you're still hungry after dinner you can

1070
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,839
snack on an apple and a date now listen

1071
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,880
some people who do the 28 28 day cleanse

1072
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,760
a lot of them because it's it's a

1073
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,920
cleanse they end up eating like hardly

1074
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,480
anything so you need to know that that's

1075
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,920
not where you go with this you just you

1076
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,160
just don't say oh my God I'm on to

1077
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,880
cleanse because I remember I did a

1078
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,640
cleanse from some other guy I did a

1095
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,359
say no I'm doing it to the letter no I'm

1096
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,400

done no I'm doing it I got the book I'm

1098
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,720

1100
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,520

you don't want to go without food you

1102
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,920
want to go and buy enough fruits and

1103
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,280
vegetables and have a stock you don't

1104
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,599

it's really a great way of doing it

1112
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,040
let's talk about

1113
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,079
modifications if you don't want to eat

1114
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,680

long as you're eating I know it's not

1141
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,880
about a starvation diet this is not a

1142
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,599
starvation diet this isn't about

1143
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,760
stopping eating this isn't about eating

1144
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:16,480
no more it's about eating

1145
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,560
more so that's that's the whole thing

1146
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,920
here so you could cycle through

1147
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,440
different salad greens so salad soup

1148
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,760
greens if you need to as well I mean

1149
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,920
that's the whole thing don't pay any

1150
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,280
mind to the myth that spinach will harm

1151
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,359
you when it's raw it's the opposite

1152
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,200
cooked spinach is the one where the

1153
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,920
where the the oxyc acid actually tends

1154
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,160
to run and become

1155
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,960
destabilized that's the problem right

1156
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,520
there I can't believe to this day the

1157
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,680
spinach myth has been flipped and it's

1158
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,960
flipped where raw bad and Cook's

1159
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,280
actually the way to do it for spinach

1160
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,920
it's the opposite raw spinach is this is

1161
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,240
the way to do it to get the miraculous

1162
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,440
benefit without any harm at all on any

1163
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,359
level and you know and that's something

1164
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,079
to really really understand so that's

1165
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,599
misinformation out there you want

1166
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,839
spinach in its raw form it's not like

1167
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,440
other vegetables you can steam you don't

1168
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,000
want spinach cooked or sauteed if you

1169
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,079
eat raw spinach soup every day for a

1170
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,599
month it will be the best thing you ever

1171
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,760
done for yourself I'm going to repeat

1172
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,960
this if you eat raw spinach soup every

1173
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,720
day for one month it will be the best

1174
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,359
thing

1175
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,640
you've ever done for

1176
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,400
yourself don't be afraid to eat as many

1177
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,160
greens as you'd like too and this is

1178
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,680
this is all important to do it's okay to

1179
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,920
to eat an entire meal of just fruit if

1180
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,720
you had to perfectly fine actually if

1181
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,839
that's what you want to do so these are

1182
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,680
some of the different options you can

1183
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,480
balance it with a few celery sticks and

1184
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,760
maybe even some celery juice in the

1185
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,359
morning which would be amazing I never

1186
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,920
told anybody in my life to only eat

1187
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:01,640
fruit and fruit only and that's it where

1188
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,880
it's fruit only with nothing else never

1189
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,880
have I ever told anybody in my life to

1190
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,000
do that but yet misinformation goes

1191
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,800
around hear people like oh he's all

1192
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,040
about fruit you only eat fruit yeah sure

1193
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,440
sure sure never said it in my life I

1194
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,319
mean you could eat only fruit you could

1195
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,520
but in the medical medium 20day cleanse

1196
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:25,480
you'd be doing celery sticks you'd be

1197
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,480
doing the other options too it would

1198
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,640
just be fruit for dinner see this is

1199
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,559
what I'm talking about and very

1200
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,960
important to understand you can do

1201
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,200

1202
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960

1204
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,559
to could chop up mangoes tomatoes

1205
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,359
cucumbers don't be afraid of tomatoes

1206
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,640
whatever you do do not get suckered in

1207
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,520

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,520
can there's what you can do if you

1256
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,240
really have to if you really have to add

1257
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,680
in a cooked

1258
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,079
option add in a cooked option I'm trying

1259
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,800
to work with you for sure add in a

1260
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,559
cooked option like a potato so a steamed

1261
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,280
potato not baked potato a steamed potato

1262
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,520
steamed only you have it chopped up and

1263
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,240
thrown on your salad as a dinner

1264
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,480
option now if you're not getting you

1265
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,000
know the greatest results ever it might

1266
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,040
it's don't think it's because you got

1267
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,480
the potato on there which you you've not

1268
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,040
getting the greatest results ever you

1269
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,720
just got to do the 28 day cleanse as

1270
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,920
long as you can you can do it for a week

1271
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,079
you can do it for two weeks you can do

1272
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,640
it three weeks you can do it four weeks

1273
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,079
and that potato is going to do great for

1274
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,280
you because it is healing and it can

1275
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,400
help you heal so it is an option and I'm

1276
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,079
saying don't blame the potato if you're

1277
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,960
not getting a result quick or anything

1278
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,160
like that because there's potato

1279
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,680
propaganda trying to destroy the the

1280
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,079
healthy potatoes that actually help us

1281
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,359
heal and get us better and everything

1282
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,680
else it's just that the 28 day cleanse

1283
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,839
I'm trying to maximize all the raw food

1284
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:49,200
enzymes but the potato will be perfectly

1285
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,720
fine if you need that option so giving

1286
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,760
you that option the other option would

1287
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,720
be butternut squash or winter squash of

1288
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,839
some kind steaming it not baking it with

1289
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,640
olive oil steaming it and having some

1290
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,280
slices of it or having some of that um

1291
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,599
some pieces of the butternut squash or

1292
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,839
cut it up in squares whatever you want

1293
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,720
to do and steam it and put that in your

1294
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,520
salad so that's another great option too

1295
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,359
so you feel like hey wait a minute I can

1296
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,880
actually do just you know a couple

1297
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,760
little cooked options at dinner it has

1298
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,079
to be at dinner time it really

1299
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,240
does so if you need and I'm talking

1300
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,920
about this if you need to pull back the

1301
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,599
rains on this diet by swapping out

1302
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,920
spinach soup dinner for a meal of Simply

1303
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:34,800
cooked vegetables Steam and roast them

1304
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,520
it's not going to be responsible for why

1305
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,880
you didn't get a result after the first

1306
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,880
day of doing it don't be like oh no I'm

1307
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,559
doing the steam cooked vegetables and

1308
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,280
maybe that's why I'm not better in 3

1309
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:49,040
days no no no no no you can do you can

1310
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,520
pull back the rains you can swap things

1311
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,720
out if you're really have to you're

1312
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,839
still going to get benefits you're still

1313
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,119
going to move forward you're still going

1314
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,760
to be doing some great things but I

1315
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,520
still would like for you to maximize the

1316
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,400
quickest quickest quickest the most

1317
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,559
powerfullest of course doing it raw 28

1318
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,720
Days Raw but you have these options and

1319
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,480
they're not going to get in your way

1320
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,839
they're going to help you so you do some

1321
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,040
simply cooked vegetables you can you

1322
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,680
know you can even you know do some other

1323
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,880
things too you got the winter squash I

1324
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,480
talked about you got zucchini you can

1325
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,160
play with too by steaming that potatoes

1326
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,480
yams even some broccoli and califlour

1327
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,200
and even steaming asparagus you can do

1328
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,200
that if you need to put it on your

1329
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,040
salads at night at the end of the day

1330
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,800
that's how you do it so you put it on

1331
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,400
salads at night at the end of the day

1332
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,599
and that would be really you know that

1333
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
would be a great way of doing it because

1334
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,280
I know so many of you might be like hey

bit of those very things I just said the

1344
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,640

of your salad or your spinach salad or

1347
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,280

1348
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,720
the day and have that for dinner and

1349
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,559
start back up all over again in the

1350
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,960
morning and keep on going you might even

1351
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,119
find you might even find yourself

1352
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,720
actually eventually saying you know what

1353
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,160
I don't need to do the steamed vegetable

1354
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,480
at the end of the day I'm actually good

1355
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,240
just give me the salad give me the salad

1356
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,040
and I'm good you might actually head in

1357
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,359
that direction you might be there how

1358
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,359
amazing is

1359
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:41,079
that you might even be there on that

1360
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:44,480
level so the body is forgiving the body

1361
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:46,960
is forgiving it really is when we're

1362
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,960
giving it the things we need when we're

1363
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,280
giving it the things that the body

1364
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,440
really truly needs and loves so let's

1365
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,119
recap what is the power of the 28 day

1366
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,920
cleanse the medical medium 28- day

1367
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,319
cleanse what is the power what are we

1368
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,880
talking about what's the deal that we're

1369
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:03,599
talking about here okay first of all

1370
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,079
we're rebuilding our hydrochloric acid

1371
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,559
in the stomach that's the gastric juices

1372
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,520
the seven blend that I talk about in

1373
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,119
medical medium book one we're restoring

1374
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,839
and that's the Undiscovered hydrochloric

1375
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,319
acid complex that's actually in your

1376
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,240
stomach that science of research hasn't

1377
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,240
even discovered yet we're restoring that

1378
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,040
to help break down food digest food and

1379
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,839
to move you forward what else are we

1380
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,799
doing we're we're cleansing and cleaning

1381
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,720
out a liver that could have

1382
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:28,359
Pharmaceutical in it old antibiotics

1383
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,520
anti-depressants who knows what else is

1384
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,760
in there any kind of drug it can have

1385
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,960
anything recreational drugs from 2030

1386
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,720
years ago it can have um petrochemicals

1387
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,640
you know air fresheners all kinds of

1388
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,280
toxins everything else on the sun could

1389
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,000
easily be in their perfumes colognes

1390
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,720
they're all inside the liver you don't

1391
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,040
think they are in there they're in there

1392
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,720
you want to live in denial we can live

1393
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,920
in denial but they're in there the liver

1394
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,720
takes it on all of it every last bit of

1395
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,440
it heavy metals included and what are

1396
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,799
you

1397
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,160
doing you're you're actually getting

1398
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,640
your liver back taking it out of

1399
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,599
sluggishness taking it out of fatty

1400
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,599
liver restoring it making the bile

1401
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,799
production stronger and that bile goes

1402
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:08,839
right into Theo digestive tract and what

1403
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:10,359
does it do it breaks down rancid fats

1404
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,079
that have been making you sick for years

1405
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:15,839
and years and years putrified rancid sat

1406
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,760
putrified rancid fats that have been

1407
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,119
literally along the lining of the

1408
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,520
intestinal tract and colon and even

1409
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,799
bottom of the stomach and it starts to

1410
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,920
break all that down and eat it up 20th

1411
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:28,119
day cleanse is going to do a lot for

1412
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,400
your liver your body it's going to help

1413
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,040
feed nutrients to your central nervous

1414
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,520
system so you can start repairing from

1415
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,480
all the different neurological symptoms

1416
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,839
we suffer from that I covered and many

1417
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,839
more at the beginning of the

1418
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,680
show it's going to help support your

1419
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,040
adrenals make your adrenals uh Stronger

1420
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,839
because when you're eating like the

1421
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,400
snacks in between and everything else it

1422
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,480
helps to support your adrenals if

1423
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,040
someone tells you you should only eat

1424
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,920
twice a day once a day no no no no no

1425
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,280
actually no it's not that's not how you

1426
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,200
restore your your adrenals it's not how

1427
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,520
you st not how you do

1428
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,359
it I mean you can do some intermittent

1429
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,200
fasting you know along the way there's

1430
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:06,040
other ways of doing you can you can eat

1431
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,000
light you can do some different stuff

1432
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,760
but it's not good to be doing that long

1433
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,240
term forever you got to make sure you're

1434
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,559
supporting the adrenals and and in

1435
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,920
medical medium I talk about all about

1436
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,720
that making it better and better so

1437
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,319
you're restoring your adrenals you're

1438
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,880
actually helping there you're also

1439
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,680
lowering your viral load because you're

1440
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,359
not eating foods like eggs and cheese

1441
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,640
and other things that feed and gluten

1442
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,920
that feed viruses to make you sick

1443
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,640
because that's why people are sick

1444
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,760
