everything and they're just like i'm

122
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
transformed just from that alone right

123
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
yeah because we get we get so in our

124
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
heads i mean look

125
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,200
it's like you know there's a lot going

131
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,000
on so getting getting that mind right is

132
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
yeah but i think even when i am like

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
doing a ton of music

134
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
and i'm working really hard lou knows

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
this as well like

136
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,680
i tend to actually get in my fields

137
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,680
and get depressed and get anxiety

138
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
but the one time that like right now i'm

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
feeling great because i'm

140
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
working out every day i'm doing my best

141
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
to like

142
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,199
you know eat really healthy i actually

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,840
made cake last night that doesn't count

144
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,080
but like like i do my best to like

145
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,199
because the only time i actually

146
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,680
feel right and feel like i can like

147
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,600
create well communicate well

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,199
is whenever i'm eating healthy and

149
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
exercising every day

150
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,919
like without going to the gym like i

151
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
wake up like so drowsy and like i

152
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
i don't know there's just something

153
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000
about that that completely opens

154
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
your mind yeah you're moving your blood

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
you're circulating

156
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
toxins that are floating around in there

157
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
because what happens is those toxins

158
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
just build up

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
and they they build up they get into the

160
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,919
brain they sit inside the liver

161
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,120
then your liver gets stagnant and

162
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,880
sluggish and then you're eating things

163
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
you're not supposed to eat well well

164
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,199
whatever someone might think they're

165
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
supposed to eat things and then so

166
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
whatever but you're eating things that

167
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
may not be good for your liver

168
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
and then it's getting really sluggish

169
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
and then all of a sudden you're dragging

170
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
and you're just like dragging your butt

171
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
you wake up the morning you don't feel

172
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,680
clear you don't feel good you get

173
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
depressed

174
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
for no reason or and all that just

175
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
starts kicking in and really

176
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
it's about moving those toxins through

177
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,440
and everything celery cheese is a big

178
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
piece of it it's why

179
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
it's why spirit of compassion brought

180
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
celery juice to the world because

181
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
it it gets it helps people get all that

182
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
going it's just it's part of it

183
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
let's elaborate on that spirit of

184
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
compassion yeah yeah

185
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
so medical medium where does that come

186
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,759
from well it comes from my my

187
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
great-grandfather

188
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
uh named me the medical medium when i

189
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,039
was a child so that's when when i got to

190
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
receive the gift of hearing a voice

191
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
perfectly clear that tells me what's

192
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
going on with somebody's health so

193
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
anybody around me

195
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880

decade

199
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
over the decades and then eventually

200
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
spirit of compassion said you have to

201
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000

202
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,039
like male or female or how does that

233
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
come across you whenever you

235
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
person to ever

236
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
ask that question in that way in that

237
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
way like

238
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
is it something you hear in your head

239
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,599
yeah or is it something

240
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
else and it's out it's from out here so

241
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,280
it's like having like

242
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
you hear me now clear right i hear the

243
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
same way from the spirit of compassion

244
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
from the voice i hear clear like you

245
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,759
hear me right now

246
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
the same voice every time same voice

247
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
every time and it can be blocked a

248
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
little bit too because it's coming into

249
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,720
the right ear so i could take my hand

250
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,560
and just do this and kind of block it a

251
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
little bit because it's coming it's real

252
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
time it's in real time

253
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,880
right now anytime it's coming through

254
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
yeah and that's how it works so it's not

255
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
in my head it's not like i'm channeling

256
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
i'm not channeling anything

257
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
or it's not my intuition and i'm kind of

258
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
thinking what does my voice inside of me

259
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
say or what is that

260
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
what does that child voice in myself say

261
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
or what is no that's not it at all

262
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
it's a voice that's been basically

263
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,000
torturing me since i was four years old

264
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
so there you go so

265
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,759
you like be on a date and you say

266
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
something wrong and then the spirit of

267
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,720
compassion is like no

268
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
not that exactly always correcting me

269
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,240
always trying to keep me you know

270
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
making sure i say the right things all

271
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
of that because

272
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,440

277
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
things and

278
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
let's work together after this interview

279
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,039
hey look we'd love to and aches and

280
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240

281
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
mystery fatigue do you know anybody

282
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,960

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
tired they're like more tired than just

284
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,719
tired parents

285
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
yeah absolutely i feel like i've been

286
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,719
slept since 2005.

287
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,240
so like yeah

288
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
we have to get strong we got to get that

289
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
energy back and so there's so many

290
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
people dealing with all these things

291
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,640
they're going around but we're all

292
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
supposed to pretend it's normal

293
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
we're all supposed to pretend that it's

294
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,279
a normal occurrence happening

295
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
yeah that we're supposed to be sick now

296
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,240
everybody's supposed to have a symptom

297
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
or something wrong with them that's how

298
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
we're that's kind of how we're go like

299
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
it's the new normal

300
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,240
oh what do you got you got a thyroid

301
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
problem oh whatever it actually is it's

302
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
scary yeah right yeah

303
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
and so but it's not supposed to be like

304
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
no and that's

305
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
it's like a constant complain of

306
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
illnesses exactly

307
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,160
i mean you know as complaints can be but

308
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
i mean i guess we're conditioned

309
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
to be negative as a race anyway yeah so

310
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,800
i mean if we were conditioned to be

311
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
positive then a negative negative

312
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,080
situation comes in we would kind of

313
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
brush it off because now we brush off

314
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
the positive situations as it's because

315
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
it doesn't feel right to us

316
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,080
because it's not the normal feeling of

317
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,480
it exactly um so celery juice

318
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
in terms of is it the placebo effect is

319
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
it the actual juice that's healing

320
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,600
people or is it people believing

321
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,000
that this or is it a mixture of both

322
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,279
well when did placebo fix

323
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
the world i don't get it wouldn't

324
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,360
everybody be better placebo worked

325
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,760
true think about this a placebo worked

326
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,959
yeah they would have ingeniously

327
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
you know science of research would have

328
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
placeboed everybody out to get to get

329
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,080
them better

330
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
they'd all be better everybody would be

331
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
better yeah because

332
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,800
all you need is any kind of placebo tell

333
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,240
somebody that this pill works if it

334
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,399
doesn't they should be better

335
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,680
yeah it's a placebo yeah but see so

336
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,800
placebo doesn't work

337
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,360
it never did yeah if it did i mean

338
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,200
i could hand you like a candy corn okay

339
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
a little piece of candy and say hey like

340
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
you know what i mean we can

341
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,800
it just you can't you you can't get

342
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,519
better on that yeah

343
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,399
i believed it and for a fact 100 it

344
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
would

345
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,959
well because in terms of how i live my

346
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
universe if i believe things for fact

347
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,399
yeah they shall appear well you know

348
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
what when you're when you're

349
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,839
when you're bedridden yeah and you can't

350
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,360
push out of bed

351
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
and your body your body's covered with

352
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,920
exomar psoriasis yeah and you're really

353
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
sick

354
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,959
and and there's no placebo that can fix

355
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
that yeah

356
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,399
it just isn't i don't care what doctor

357
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
whoever comes in and says

358
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,600
take this pill and it's a placebo yeah

359
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
you're going to get out of bed you're

360
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
going to be able to function you're

361
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
going to get rid of that brain fog and

362
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
no that brain fog stays no matter

363
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
what's happening that's the difference

364
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
when you're chronically sick

365
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,399
man it's a whole other story and i've

366
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
been batting for the chronically sick

367
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
that's the whole thing i'm the messenger

368
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
to

369
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
kind of have their back because they've

370
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
been swept under the carpet and

371
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,360
kind of pushed aside for the decades

372
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,839
it's been unbelievable right

373
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200

374
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
science and research

375
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,920

376
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000

that's how it's working and it's

400
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
spreading it's spreading like wildfire

401
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,680
you gotta remember something you guys

402
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
there's no money behind it celery juice

403
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,320
isn't a trend because

404
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
it was like backed by tons of money to

405
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
make it trendy

406
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,399
yeah celery juice is trendy because the

407
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
stuff

408
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,560
works yeah it just does i think you've

409
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
single-handedly pushed the price of

410
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
celery up

411
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,600
in los angeles yeah yeah yeah yeah

412
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,200
no it's crazy it's been you should come

413
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
out with your own line of celery

414
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,720
your own farm of celery

415
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
is that is there a difference for you

416
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,399
between say organic celery and kind of

417
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,399
normal normal celery or celery or that

418
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
or organic fruits in general do you have

419
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
to juice it what if you just

420
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
eat a celery you can eat it it's good

421
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,360
for you it's not going to fix anything

422
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
better juice it yeah it's not going to

423
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,240
fix anything eating

424
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,880
squeeze the [ __ ] out of it drink it yeah

425
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
it never fixed anybody eating it it just

426
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
hasn't

427
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
it but it's the juicing has to be

428
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
juicing on an empty stomach

429
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
yeah that's you know 16 ounces minimum

430
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,600
on an empty stomach

431
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
32 ounces and you're moving forward i

432
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
mean you're moving forward that's a lot

433
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,200
of celery

434
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,959
64 ounces yeah if you really have

435
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
something that's major going on with

436
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,560
your health is that every day

437
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
like sweet and salty

439
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,720
sometimes it's like just too astringent

440
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,720
and like bittersweet i'm asking because

441
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,680

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,519
when you juice it it actually tastes

454
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,279
better than eating it really

455
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,279
or something to make it better it has

456
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,000
like a sweet taste to it when you drink

457
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,760
it

458
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
but yeah when i eat it like i have to

459
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,000
like dip it in hummus or do some other

460
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,560

461
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,880

466
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,079
sensing some chicken fingers

467
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,279
in here i actually have a question

468
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,880
okay so it says you're you

469
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,320
really discovered like that you had this

470
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,160
amazing gift when you were four

471
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
yeah that's when it started at age four

472
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,040
with your grandmother

473
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,199
right there and um you just had

474
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
you kept getting this feeling that she

475
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,800
was sick with

476
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
cancer well i couldn't avoid it because

477
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
the information came through all the

478
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,959
time

479
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,639
so spirit spirit of compassion would say

480
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,920
you know this is what she has going on

481
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
and you know you're four years old you

482
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,880
don't know what the words mean

483
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
so you're trying to pronounce my

484
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,160
grandfather died when i was four of lung

485
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,760
cancer so that's why

486
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,279
yeah so it's crazy so that's why i

487
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,440
wanted to ask you like

488
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,720
when you got that did you did they take

489
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,720
her to the doctor

490
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
yeah a few a few weeks later a few weeks

491
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
because she was fine she didn't have a

492
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,320
symptom

493
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
there was no symptoms she was perfectly

494
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,199
fine but it took about three weeks

495
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,800
later and took her in because i was

496
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,120
saying it too much

497
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920

that have healed from the medical medium

516
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,199
information that no

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
it's not a ghost they know what the

518
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,800
information is because

561
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
amazon naked

568
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000

571
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,400
yeah they just do things like that right

572
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,079
me you know it's not like that and i

573
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
always say the spirit well how come me

574
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,079
and spirit said because

575
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,039
you can handle it because it's really

576
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
difficult

577
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,160
it's really difficult on a way because

578
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
you can't

579
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,559
you don't live a normal life whatsoever

580
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,320
yeah and i mean a normal life i mean

581
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
you're just that's it when it started

582
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
happening it was

583
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,520
it was like okay you know look i

584
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
couldn't pursue anything else couldn't

585
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,000
pursue a dream couldn't pursue anything

586
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
else couldn't do

587
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
anything it had to be this only there

588
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
was no way out

589
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,160
wow and it takes it takes a skin for

590
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,120
this yeah and i didn't know i have the

591
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,600
skin for it but

592
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
but apparently i i might have it because

593
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
i'm still

594
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
here and i didn't jump ship no so it's

595
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,919
yeah

596
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,320
does the spirit uh of compassion ever

597
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
talk to you about was it predetermined

598
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
you were supposed to was this pre-birth

599
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
or is it

600
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,880
of a spiritual nature or did they say

601
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
where they why they come to you where

602
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
they come from

603
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,600
what plane they live on i think it's the

604
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
strongest that that can handle the

605
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,559
strongest that survive it

606
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,400
yeah you know because when i when i

607
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,160
asked questions a lot of that it was

608
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,120
given to others but they didn't stay

609
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
here long

610
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,320
yeah because it wasn't easy

611
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
the teenage time is the hardest when

612
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,919
you're a teenager with it that's when

613
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,360
you lose it that's when you lose your

614
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
mind with this gift yeah

615
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,200
because you want to like just be normal

616
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
you want to do normal things you want to

617
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
have fun and you're hearing a voice

618
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,120
telling you that someone's got a brain

619
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,520
tumor you hear a voice

620
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,039
non-stop you go into a crowd and then

621
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
everybody in that crowd is being

622
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,480
assessed by spirit and

623
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,720
information is flying in coming in you

624
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,679
know if i get on if i get on a plane or

625
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
something like that

626
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
everybody on that plane i mean i was on

627
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,760
a plane one time

628
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,200
and uh you know my assistant was sitting

629
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
with me because i have to go with an

630
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
assistant because

631
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
it's just too much with the readings and

632
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
and all of that

633
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,280
and so so i'm i'm on the plane and

634
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
there's all this commotion going on all

635
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,160
this commotion from spirit

636
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,080
well actually well there's commotion

637
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
going on on a plane like stewardesses

638
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,720
are running around there's all this

639
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,200
stuff happening

640
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
and spirit tells me that somebody in the

641
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
back is seizuring

642
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,760
so they're seizuring in the back wow

643
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,440
it's like it's a guy back there at

644
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
seizuring and everything so

645
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,200
i tell my assistant so the finally

646
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
everything calms down after about 20

647
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,919
minutes half an hour or so

648
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
and then my assistant asked the

649
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
stewardess what's happening and she goes

650
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
there's a man back there seizuring

651
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,679
and it's it's always there and i can't

652
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,720
get away from it and when i was a

653
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
teenager

654
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,760
just think about that that's a difficult

655
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
time for everybody

656
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
when this is all you have to do or all

657
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,679
you you all you're supposed to do you

658
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
can't get out of it you can't get away

659
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,919
from it

660
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,280
you got to be strong yeah i mean there

661
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
was times like i'm not

662
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,600
i'm not going on yeah with this i'm i

663
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
might jump ship so

664
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
but you know what i hung in there and i

665
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,320
think that's what predetermined it

666
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,400
it's like okay picking you you can

667
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
probably handle it for some reason yeah

668
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,360
who knows what that reason is

669
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,960
yeah but yeah that's how it went i mean

670
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,159
obviously the reason is this

671
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,200
yeah spreads spread the knowledge of of

672
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,520
health so is it only the the medical

673
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
that

674
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
the the spirit of compassion speaks to

675
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
you about it's the most important so if

676
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,039
you was to say eat a pizza it'd be like

677
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,520
nah bro not today don't eat that

678
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,320
well you know what of course like small

679
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,080
talk like that

680
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,080
yeah you know it's always there with

681
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
spirit absolutely don't worry

682
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
spirit's never short for all that stuff

683
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,159
yeah without a doubt

684
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,919
but the medical is the most important

685
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,919
because if you don't feel good

686
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,679
yeah if you're if you can't like do your

687
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,120
work if you can't live your life

688
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
if you can't be happy in your

689
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,960
relationship because you're sick if

690
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,640
if you just got diagnosed with something

691
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,559
and and the doctor said well

692
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
hey your body's attacking itself because

693
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,320
you got an autoimmune disease

694
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,679
which actually is incorrect how it works

695
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
the body doesn't attack itself but the

696
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,559
point is when you're

697
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,799
driving from that doctor's office and

698
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
you've been told you got something yeah

699
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,559
you're miserable you're in misery it

700
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,320
takes over so many people are like oh my

701
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
god what is this now i got like thyroid

702
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
problems now

703
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,640
or what do i have i have this and and

704
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,440
it's hard so

705
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
medical is the most important and that's

706
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,320
the whole point it's your health it's

707
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,520
the most important thing yeah

708
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,640
i agree yeah yeah so in terms of say

709
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,440
for example um can can diet uh

710
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,240
make you know aid in anxiety and

711
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
depression

712
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
and all these type of aspects to the

713
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
human you know psyche

714
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
or uh does it have an adverse effect on

715
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,200
it should i say

716
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,400
well it has diet plays a role in getting

717
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
those things better

718
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
yeah but the problem is science of

719
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
research doesn't know

720
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,520
why or how someone can get better why

721
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
food does work

722
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,520
doesn't work we're still in those really

723
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,159
early stages of understanding it

724
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,000
what's the cause of anxiety unknown yeah

725
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
it's unknown right now right that's what

726
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
it is

727
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
well spirit of compassion knows the

728
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
cause of anxiety mystery anxiety

729
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,520
the cause i write it in the books i put

730
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
it in the books the information is there

731
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,480
people have been able to heal it because

732
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
they know the cause that's what i've

733
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
been able to do

734
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,440
is with this voice that comes to me i've

735
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,919
been able to bring that information

736
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
forward

737
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,200
and it's never happened before it's

738
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,120
never happened yeah there's an actual

739
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,720
cost to anxiety there's actual cause for

740
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,960
all these illnesses for aches and pains

741
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,120

honestly if there is please don't tell

751
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,039
me because i'm a really big

752
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
hypochondriac

753
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,559
and i go to my cardiologist and have him

754
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,320
take blood all the time and he's always

755
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,600
like noah you've got to stop coming

756
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,000
because you're okay

757
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,720

that stuff so

759
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,559
don't tell me if something's wrong but

760
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,200
how come that does happen

761
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,799
what is that it stops after a second

762
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
yeah but that's different that's like

763
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,919
just

764
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,600
little little earrings comes and goes

765
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,200
once in a while

766
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,960
no maybe that's your spirit of

767
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,640
compassion trying to get through

768
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,000
i have i do have to say like for me

769
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
i think we've talked about this before

770
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,320
my dad is very spiritual

771
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,440
and as am i so like i different from you

772
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,120
my whatever my like feelings that i get

773
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,960
or not like

774
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
so standing next to somebody and

775
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,559
somebody will tell me what's going on in

776
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,720
their lives but like i've definitely

777
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,720
always had like a more spiritual

778
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
connection where i've been able to like

779
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
with

780
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
being in my house or like things like

781
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,880
that or like i just have very strong

782
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,039
connection with my grandfather who i

783
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,200
know for a fact that i like get

784
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,039
these message from messages from you're

785
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,080
connected i'm very connected

786
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,760
my dad was very connected my whole life

787
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,120
and like i think that's where i

788
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,600
definitely get that from

789
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,520
yeah and like i don't know i think

790
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
that's always been like when i was a kid

791
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
i was actually like i would get kind of

792
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
freaked out

793
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,880
because like i lived in a very like

794
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,559
historical home in a historical part of

795
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
nashville where there was a battle of

796
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,880
franklin and

797
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,400
all the energy is so actually heavy i

798
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,400
know that's like

799
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
not your field of like vibes that you

800
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
get but i that's just something that

801
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
like i grew up with was like i would be

802
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,360
at home and i could like

803
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,120
feel like oh my grandfather is like

804
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
sending me like a message

805
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,159
what do you think about that do you

806
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
believe in that

807
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,760
oh absolutely absolutely i mean i could

808
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,360
use spirit for that i could use spirit

809
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,520
for those things

810
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,960
oh yeah i mean i can but it's it's never

811
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
the most important

812
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,640
when and i'm not saying that's not

813
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,880
important that's important 1 000

814
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
but when a mom can't get out of bed to

815
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
take care of her three children

816
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,840
and she loses her part-time job and

817
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,919
she's like

818
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,440
and she can't even barely walk or take a

819
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,919
shower because that chronic fatigue hits

820
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
her

821
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,080
and no one nowhere can help her 20

822
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
doctors 10 neurologists

823
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
10 cardiologists um everything

824
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,640
information on the internet can't help

825
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,919
her

826
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,919
yep and that's the most important so

827
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,919
that's what that's what the books have

828
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,799
done it's for millions that are in that

829
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,640
condition

830
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,600
and that's why i have to keep on using

831
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,360
that so if if i do take the time out

832
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
and and go the other direction

833
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
spiritually which i love to do don't get

834
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,200
me wrong i love to do

835
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,200
have you used spirit yeah absolutely

836
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,880
absolutely i have for for all those

837
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
different things exactly

838
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,360
but once again the need is unbelievable

839
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
there's a way there was a waiting list

840
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480

841
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840

their loved ones in different ways or

898
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,320
what's happening in the moment like

899
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,240
is the ringing in their ear some some

900
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,600
something yeah a message coming through

901
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
what was that dream

902
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,840
you had the one that the one that like

903
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240

905
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
exactly yeah

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
like that's why i looked right at you

908
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200

910
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,840

and talking spirit of compassion and

912
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,440
being like what does her dream mean

913
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,440
because that is like that's there's

914
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
something there was it a past life

915
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
was it something in the future that we

916
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,559
don't know about was it something in the

917
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,480
moment where it's about to happen or is

918
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,399
it a direction where you're going to be

919
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,520
focused on soon because of a passion

920
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,760
inside of you is it

921
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,279
healing a wound that you have from a few

922
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
years ago from somebody

923
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,440
is the dream about a wound that's

924
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,200
healing because you had kind of a bad

925
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,440
a betrayal going on or something some

926
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
kind of trust was broken

927
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,480
and all of that that's powerful stuff i

928
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,120
love it

929
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,520
i want to dedicate time on it i can't

930
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,240
yeah

931
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,120
i can't that's how it is it's funny

932
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,760
because um

933
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,159
i had a dream recently and i beat myself

934
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,640
up

935
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,559
for not remembering the detail of it but

936
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,159
i i dreamed that i found the formula to

937
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,200
see the other side while still being

938
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,679
alive

939
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,679
yeah and i saw the formula on some paper

940
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,679
we were running all these weird tests

941
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
like using human blood and [ __ ] like

942
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
that and then all of a sudden you would

943
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
have that dream i would have that dream

944
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
right

945
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,039
and they would have that dream and then

946
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,200
literally

947
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,080
um we did all those tests and it went on

948
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
for ages and then

949
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
there was just this paper and it was

950
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
just believing you could see the other

951
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
side

952
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,200
but i couldn't remember what the formula

953
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,039
was for it

954
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,520
and i was like [ __ ] and it felt so real

955
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,320
yeah yeah and there's there's reasons

956
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,840
for that

957
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,679
one thing you get connected to you want

958
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,000
to get connected to is angels you want

959
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
to

960
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
always focus about angels and focused on

961
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,559
angels

962
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,440
you believe in god yeah i believe in god

963
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,559
absolutely but

964
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,159
hey high five for god but but but at the

965
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,679
same time if someone believes in the

966
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,960
universe and that's what they believe in

967
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
and they don't believe in god but it's

968
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,799
the universe i'm i'm i stand behind them

969
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,399
yeah if they believe in the light

970
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
and there's some kind of light if they

971
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,000
believe in the creator if they believe

972
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
in nothing that we're on this big rock

973
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
and it's just a ball it's just a ball of

974
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,880
gravel and it's floating through space

975
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,760
and then you live and you die and that's

976
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,080
what they believe in

977
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,880
look i'm okay with that i mean i believe

978
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
in god

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,679
of miles before you get to it

1042
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,519
yeah a lot of bottom line too yeah the

1043
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,360
first fence is just the first fence and

1044
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,039
you got what 300 miles so yeah

1045
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,200

1048
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,240

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,760
no way yes sorry survived in my fields

1050
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,679
you know the bottom line is with that

1051
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,039
it's like it i always that's one of

1052
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
those soul decisions

1053
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,360
yeah okay because there's there's a few

1054
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
things that are so soul decisions

1055
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,679
it's in the person's soul and i don't

1056
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,120
have a place to say

1057
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,760
yay or nay or or where i stand on it

1058
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,360
yeah because it's it's different than

1059
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,440
what's the cause of

1060
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
rheumatoid arthritis what's the cause of

1061
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,600

yeah what's the cause of lupus i have a

1065
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,039
stand i have a place in that

1066
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,960
spirit allows me to have that marijuana

1067
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,720
totally up it's a sole decision of

1068
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,360
somebody whether

1069
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,919
they think they need it don't need it

1070
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,080
use it

1071
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,080
don't use it it's one of those it's kind

1072
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,679
of like abortion it's a sole decision i

1073
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
have no place

1074
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,039
to say you you shouldn't get an abortion

1075
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
or you should get one i mean there's

1076
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,840
that's

1077
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,080
that's this is one of those this is one

1078
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,559
of those epic soul decision places

1079
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
like vaccinations it's like what you

1080
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,960

1082
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,080
some people think it it kills the world

1083
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
some people think you know what i mean

1084
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
it's like

1085
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,399
it's like marijuana is one of those it's

1086
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,960
like the sole decision that i have no

1087
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,200
place to decide or actually give you

1088
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,320
even my opinion on it because that's

1089
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
something that's like

1090
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,440
that's that that's something that's

1091
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
deeper within

1092
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
that you just can't you can't touch and

1093
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
you can't play with it

1094
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
yeah yeah would that be the same for

1095
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,519

i'm the fairy god so vaccinations

1111
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,720
what do we feel about those that's the

1112
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,760
same thing same thing it's like the

1113
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,000
marijuana yeah

1114
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,039
okay it's because what happens is

1115
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,919
there's people that

1116
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,080
they think there's they they believe

1117
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,960
that without it the world will end

1118
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,840
yeah and and that's that's in the soul

1119
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
of the person

1120
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,200
yeah and then there's people that

1121
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,960
believe no you stay away from it

1122
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,240
it's the worst thing you could ever do

1123
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,159
yeah and and

1124
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,720
and it's not just the decision that

1125
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,320
occurs it's more than that

1126
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,399
it's like something that you can't

1127
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,079
penetrate it's it's it's part of

1128
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,639
who they are in a soul that decides that

1129
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,200
you see what i mean so it's

1130
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,280

all the time you know my dad he's like

1142
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,919
terrified of getting sick well i haven't

1143
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,200
thought about it i mean i haven't

1144
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,879
thought about it haven't i

1145
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,960
i've had no need for i haven't gotten

1146
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,359
any so i i haven't thought about it

1147
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
i mean but but if you if you're thinking

1148
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
about it

1149
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
yeah and you're really worried or

1150
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,040
something that's when it clicks in that

1151
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,119
soul decision clicks in you know where

1152
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
where you you know you can you can

1153
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,960
research both sides

1154
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,320
you can then decide whatever lands in

1155
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,000
that area you know

1156
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
that kind of thing like i've never had

1157
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,880
to worry about any health stuff because

1158
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,640
it's spirit compassion so

1159
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,280
i'm a different i'm the wrong person to

1160
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,480
ask that question

1161
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,280
do you partake in a little herb i i

1162
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,240
don't

1163
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
but i've i've got a nice glass of red i

1164
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,800
i no i don't

1165
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,960
oh wow neither neither no i love that

1166
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,720
okay i know but but but that has nothing

1167
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,480
to do with someone else you know no no

1168
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,599
i'm intrigued there's there's people

1169
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,440
there's people that if they don't have

1170
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,800
that glass of red wine i mean they

1171
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,800
they might have a stroke because of the

1172
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,240
amount of stress they're under yeah that

1173
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
glass of red wine

1174
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,800
is the saving grace on the weekend yeah

1175
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,440
you know has probably saved a few lives

1176
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,839
yeah sure used the wrong way and it's

1177
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,839
probably ended a few lives yeah

1178
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,520
bottom line but the bottom line is so

1179
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,480
you know it but i've never yeah i've

1180
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880

yeah exactly exactly and i mean look

1190
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,040

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,599
yeah i mean for everybody here

1192
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
okay so do you want a reading noah yeah

1193
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,320
i'm scared

1194
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,400
well well well actually remember

1195
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,599
he's a hyper kind you can do me then no

1196
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,480
don't do that

1197
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,280
you told me you're a hyper contractor no

1198
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
no

1199
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,200
let's not do noah i'm down are you sure

1200
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,359
oh yeah i volunteer

1201
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,320
are you sure yeah i'd love to if you do

1202
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,640
it i'll do it

1203
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,000
fine you sure yeah sure wait is it that

1204
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,079
bad

1205
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,760
no no we do a little fun thing but

1206
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,599
usually what i don't do i don't do

1207
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,480
here's this is this is fun this is good

1208
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,640
yeah but i don't do big serious readings

1209
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
meaning the reason why is because

1210
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,119
there's millions of people waiting that

1211
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,359
are really sick

1212
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,720
absolutely yeah and so i you know so but

1213
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,079
but this is fun this is just a little

1214
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,480
stuff your adrenals

1215
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,240
okay you have to get those better they

1216
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
are they are weakened my what your

1217
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
adrenals

1218
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,440
okay okay that's one thing your adrenal

1219
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,599
glands they sit on top of your kidneys

1220
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,599
so you have to do some things for that

1221
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,200
that the celery juice is important for

1222
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,560
that all on its own so you should be

1223
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,000
doing that that's going to improve your

1224
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,480
adrenals automatically

1225
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,200
okay but that's one focus we have to

1226
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,119
kind of catch

1227
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,680
now so that a few years down the road

1228
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
they're not

1229
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,520
like giving out a little bit on you and

1230
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,960
then you're then you're really dragging

1231
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,560
okay so so that's one thing what effects

1232
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,079
i can't even pronounce the word what am

1233
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,040
i doing wrong what what

1234
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,599
is it is it diet is it what what well

1235
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,599
you know

1236
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,960
you know i mean here's the thing like

1237
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,599
there's times where you don't eat

1238
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,119
yeah and there's times where you do it

1239
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,000
it's inconsistent with you

1240
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,680
oh my god yeah it really is yeah it is

1241
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,920
well spirit knows so that's

1242
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,440
weird knows why yeah well that's part of

1243
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,200
it because what's happening is when you

1244
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,160
get inconsistent your adrenals are

1245
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,000
flooding a lot

1246
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
you run on adrenaline a lot more than

1247
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,440
you should be

1248
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,520
and that's what's happening you're over

1249
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,920
using your adrenaline storage

1250
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,640
because you're not eating consistently

1251
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
wow

1252
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,839
at consistent times so you're burning

1253
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,359
out your adrenals

1254
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,640
thank you spirit so that's the studio

1255
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,800
the other thing is you got a little bit

1256
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,520
of mercury

1257
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
and in here oh i eat a lot of sushi well

1258
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
you got a little bit of mercury in your

1259
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
brain

1260
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,720
i'm mercury poisoning you got some more

1261
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,560
it's not really like a poisoning

1262
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,280
poisoning or anything it's not like that

1263
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,240
you just got a lot of traces and they're

1264
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
building up

1265
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,760
some is in your brain some is in the

1266
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,280
liver so we

1267
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,480
we should get the heavy metals out we

1268
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,560
should get the mercury out because

1269
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,000
that's going to start causing

1270
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,760
brain fog it's going to start causing

1271
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,520
little short circuits you're going to

1272
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,040
start getting more anxiety

1273
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,480
we got to kind of nip that in the butt

1274
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,079
between the adrenals and the mercury

1275
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,440
that's the two things with you

1276
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,560
that's it that's it for today the fun

1277
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,960
stuff yeah

1278
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,960
so there

1279
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,079
so celery juice

1280
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,359
to help the kidneys yeah and that would

1281
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,119
help the it'll help the adrenals

1282
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,599
and then what's with what do i do to

1283
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,800
help the mercury issues eating guys

1284
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
i'm treating sushi gotta get on

1285
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,440
spirulina oh yes

1286
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,320
we have that right right you gotta get

1287
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,160
on spirulina

1288
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,320
you gotta get on barley grass juice

1289
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,800
powder yeah you gotta get on that

1290
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,640
cilantro you gotta get those in there

1291
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,839
wild blueberries you could do the frozen

1292
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,400
wild blueberries

1293
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,520
is sushi bad for you yes so i should

1294
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,520
stop eating sushi yes

1295
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,839
oh my god okay your turn

1296
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,119
that was easy your turn

1297
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,440
oh man hopeless case today so no no no

1298
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
just kidding yeah exactly no you look

1299
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
good your liver

1300
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,000
getting stagnant and sluggish it's

1301
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
running hot yeah to get a hot liver

1302
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,599
so that's one thing going on that we

1303
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,320
have to be concerned about yep pancreas

1304
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,079
for you

1305
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,760
okay so it's another thing too so down

1306
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,079
the road i'm worried about diabetes for

1307
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,000
you

1308
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,520
okay even though you eat pretty healthy

1309
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
yeah but i'm worried about a little bit

1310
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,880
of a

1311
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,960
a1c rising type a type 2 diabetic

1312
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,400
because like hypoglycemia you had years

1313
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,280
ago so you had a little blood sugar

1314
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,119
inconsistency

1315
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,560
i did yeah yeah so absolutely did

1316
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,960
somebody tell you you had that

1317
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,960
yeah yeah someone what is it the my red

1318
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,560
blood cells are thicker than

1319
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
they should be or something like that so

1320
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,040
you lin or whatever that's called

1321
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,560
so you've you've been in that zone yeah

1322
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,319
so that's one thing so i got to kind of

1323
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,760
watch that so when i'm doing a read and

1324
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,119
taking a look and then i'm actually

1325
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,040
going partially blind right now good

1326
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,200
thing i wore the shades today

1327
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,240
okay because when i do the readings this

1328
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,920
white light comes

1329
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,680
and then i get snow blindness and now

1330
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,119
i'm going to be you know tripping all

1331
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
over the place for a little bit

1332
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,319
in a little while but the bottom line is

1333
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
i'm looking through your body

1334
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,680
i don't see any diseases so to speak or

1335
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,280
anything scary

1336
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,040
i mean i don't see any anything that's

1337
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
that's that's you know someone would be

1338
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,440
afraid of yeah

1339
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,760
but um future diabetes diabetes as far

1340
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,000
as

1341
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,520
pre-diabetes okay probably in about

1342
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
seven eight years you'll probably get a

1343
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,000
a1c going up

1344
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,800
uh pre-pre-diabetes diagnosis and

1345
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,319
and that's where you're going to be

1346
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,359
sitting and you've got blood sugar and

1347
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,240
inconsistencies absolutely

1348
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,839
pancreas is is with you it's always been

1349
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,400
a little weakened on and off you had

1350
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,720
food poisoning years ago spirit said and

1351
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,560
i'm trying to remember as far as spirit

1352
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,800
told me about two minutes ago so i'm

1353
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,200
asking against he had food poisoning

1354
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
i think it was probably within the last

1355
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,079
three to five years it was in his pocket

1356
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
that weakened your pancreas so that's

1357
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,240
that's why

1358
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,079
i got to look out for you and noah

1359
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
you're looking good don't worry i'm not

1360
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,800
worried i'm

1361
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
not worried about you why i'm good

1362
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
you're making your doctor's appointment

1363
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,400
for seven and eight years

1364
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,920

1365
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,440
pretty healthy eater anyway

1366
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,000

literally just

1412
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,200
advanced medical information not

1413
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,599

1437
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,079
like these three things that you buy

1438
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,079

them what it is is that

1443
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,040
here's what happened years ago years ago

1444
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,319
decades and decades ago okay

1445
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,359
there were viruses and bacteria raised

1446
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,760
in labs

1447
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,119
yep and in those labs they had to feed

1448
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,920
the viruses and bacteria

1449
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,319
yep okay and they did and eggs was the

1450
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,880
food

1451
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,000
they fed them yeah the chronic illness

1452
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,720
of today is from

1453
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,839
pathogens it's from pathogens yeah

1454
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,200
that's what it's from

1455
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,640
you get the lyme disease you've got the

1456
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
multiple sclerosis you've got the you

1457
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,359
know rheumatoid arthritis hashimoto's

1458
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
thyroiditis you've got the lupus

1459
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,880
the chronic fatigue syndrome

1460
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,640
fibromyalgia that's all i try to do as

1461
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,599
fast as i can you know i could ramble

1462
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,720
off others

1463
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,880
but those are from viruses

1464
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,160
and so we walk around with these bugs in

1465
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,920
us like epstein-barr

1466
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,760
the epstein-barr virus and one that's

1467
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,720
just that's one of 60 varieties of

1468
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,040
epstein-barr

1469
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,319
we walk around with that virus in us and

1470
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,960
it creates fatigue

1471
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,359
it creates problems and then we feed it

1472
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,839
we feed it eggs it's not that i hate

1473
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,560
eggs

1474
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,000
they're delicious everybody loves them

1475
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,000
we have connections to them

1476
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,599
our parents make us eggs their mom makes

1477
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,520
us eggs right who made you eggs

1478
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,119
who who made did anybody make you eggs

1479
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,560
um yeah

1480
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,400
i mean me and the wife make eggs pretty

1481
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,720
much on the weekends exactly right and

1482
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,599
there's there's a feeling with that yeah

1483
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,960
right i mean

1484
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,640
what about you know it you don't like

1485
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,040
them you know what it's

1486
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,960
weird actually i like them kind of

1487
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,200
but there's something about them that

1488
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
kind of grosses me out at the same time

1489
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,079
so like i'm very

1490
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,520
indifferent it actually genuinely

1491
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,040
depends on the day

1492
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,520
like since it's 100 degrees outside

1493
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,359
today

1494
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,440
yeah there's no way you'd catch me

1495
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,200
eating eggs in 100 degree weather

1496
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,640
i don't know what it is but it has to do

1497
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,240
with the weather i swear to you and

1498
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,000
everyone makes fun of me

1499
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,119
like my my best friend makes farming for

1500
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,480
it all the time he'll like let's go get

1501
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,319
breakfast and i'm like okay

1502
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,920
but i can't eat eggs it's hot outside

1503
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,880
and whenever it's hot outside

1504
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,200
eggs extremely gross me out yeah but if

1505
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,119
it's not hot and like i'm not

1506
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,480
i don't know it's something i don't know

1507
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,480
what it is but like

1508
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,760
it just depends on the day with me and

1509
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,520
eggs because like

1510
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,680
i think i'm the same though i think that

1511
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,599
makes sense it kind of grossed me out

1512
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,520
my grandma used to have an obsession

1513
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,680
with egg whites

1514
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,280
but then she'd like burn them kind of

1515
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,800
and they'd smell really bad and make the

1516
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,920
kitchen smell bad for a while and i

1517
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,760
think that really like

1518
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,280
changed my mind on eggs for a second

1519
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,680
yeah that's fine i'm indifferent about

1520
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,520
them

1521
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,400
yeah well you know well you're you're

1522
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,240
rare because so many people love them

1523
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,480
and then what happened was those viruses

1524
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,480
somehow escaped the labs

1525
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,640
they got into people over the last 70 80

1526
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,359
years we have chronic illness because of

1527
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,480
it

1528
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,920
you know and and eggs are feeding it

1529
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,680
so it's not that i'm against them or

1530
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
anything i'm just saying look if if you

1531
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,119
want a fighting chance

1532
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,520
if you've got anything wrong with you

1533
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,960
eczema anything psoriasis anything

1534
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:12,480
like in sclerosis if you have rosacea

1535
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,000
if you anything and eczema yeah well

1536
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,079
that's that's actually toxic heavy

1537
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,839
metals involved in that and then

1538
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,520
with all of that you want to get rid of

1539
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,760
the eggs you just do there's there's a

1540
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,520
reason for this so the bottom line is

1541
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,520
i took a lot of flak from that going

1542
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,839
against eggs just actually just you know

1543
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,119
there's torches picks pitchforks you

1544
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,680
know i can imagine everything

1545
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,800
what about the um what's your vibe on

1546
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,720
dairy then

1547
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,160
i mean dairy does something similar it

1548
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,480
does feed bugs it does

1549
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,240
but it's not the number one bug feeding

1550
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,280
food if someone's worried about fungus

1551
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,400
if they're worried about yeast if

1552
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,760
they're worried about mold if they're

1553
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,520
worried about bacteria if they're

1554
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,920
worried about bad bacteria whatever it

1555
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,280
is

1556
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,720
don't eat an egg you're just going to

1557
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,760
feed it yeah that's all i was just

1558
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,400
delivering the message

1559
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,400
kindly nicely it's kind of like the have

1560
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,480
you read the the china study

1561
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,920
i haven't read it but but i i hear

1562
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,839
there's good information yeah

1563
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,520
yeah and he's he basically says the same

1564
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,640
thing he feeds like rats

1565
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,119
and mice eggs and dairy and

1566
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,319
feeds the other set of mice and rats on

1567
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,000
plant-based foods

1568
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,440
yeah and the ones who got fed the dairy

1569
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,960
in eggs developed

1570
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,400
more severe cancers and diets

1571
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,760
prematurely than the ones who were i

1572
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,200
think that's a plant i think that's a

1573
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,440
plant-based book right yeah

1574
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,040
see what happens is i'm neither nor

1575
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,800
either more i'm not in the food world oh

1576
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,720
it's actually no it's just a study

1577
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,079
but there was a book after that from the

1578
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,440
writer of the china study that had a

1579
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,359
plant-based

1580
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,119
i gotcha i got you know it's so funny

1581
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,200
because i stay out of the food war you

1582
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,040
got the vegans angry at the paleo people

1583
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,960
you got the paleo anger the vegans

1584
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,319
if you're a vegan i feel so bad for

1585
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,240
vegans and plant-based people because

1586
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,240
all you have to do is sneeze

1587
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,480
and it's blamed on your diet yeah if

1588
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,119
you're paleo if your keto animal protein

1589
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,720
whatever

1590
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,760
you can sneeze you can have an injury i

1591
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
mean you could have anything you could

1592
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,000
have bad health

1593
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,720
you could have a problem you could be

1594
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,319
sick no one blames your diet but if

1595
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,839
you're plant-based it's your diet you

1596
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,240
know what i mean so all these vegans are

1597
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,920
like

1598
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,359
they're falling from grace you know and

1599
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
i feel bad for them because they get a

1600
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,760
sniffle

1601
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,280
and then they run back to animal protein

1602
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,480
but the funny thing is animal protein

1603
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,200
people are flipping too everybody's

1604
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
flip-flopping

1605
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,119
they're all going here some people vegan

1606
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,640
some back here and what happens is

1607
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,720
they're confused though they don't know

1608
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,520
what causes illness they're playing with

1609
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,119
food

1610
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,040
they're playing guessing games with food

1611
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,400
mostly i'm not trying to insult anybody

1612
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,960
i'm just just trying to let everybody

1613
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,880
know

1614
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,480
i don't have a belief system i don't

1615
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
have a belief system that plant-based is

1616
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,960
going to save the world and i don't have

1617
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,040
a belief system that

1618
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,079
animal protein is the best way to eat

1619
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,880
whatever it is

1620
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,160
i don't have that but what i do have is

1621
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,720
i will give you the cause of your

1622
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
illness

1623
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,800
and tell you what foods actually fix it

1624
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,800
you choose what diet you want to sit on

1625
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,160
that's fine and that's what a that's a

1626
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,599
spirit of compassion there's no belief

1627
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,400
systems here it's about providing

1628
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,400
information

1629
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,920
so everybody's not confused yeah because

1630
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
it's a ball of confusion you know what

1631
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,720
the thing is

1632
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,480

let me hear it and and in the end it was

1732
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,760
just somebody that had a spiritual

1733
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,520
connection and they heard a voice

1734
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,920
periodically inside their head

1735
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,640
yeah and i i have all respect for that

1736
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,400
and i just

1737
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,079
pat on the back like you know that's

1738
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,359
great i'm really i'm really glad for

1739
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,760
that but i was looking yeah

1740
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,400
to find somebody that hears it all the

1741
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,200
time

1742
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,920
in real time no matter what and can read

1743
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,680
people

1744
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,079
on the spot see it doesn't matter if i'm

1745
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,280
totally trashed i mean like exhausted

1746
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,800
like no sleep

1747
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,480
writing all night like last night i was

1748
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,079
writing the book all night i had like

1749
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,319
two hours of sleep last night so

1750
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,599
and i'm and i'm tired but the point is

1751
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,520
is that

1752
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,960
it doesn't matter spirit's gonna talk to

1753
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,000
me see how it goes

1754
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,400
because psychics and mediums once

1755
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,520
they're

1756
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,920
wasted and totally tapped out they can't

1757
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,440
they're the connection goes yeah they're

1758
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
you know when they get burnt out

1759
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,559
literally that's been one of the

1760
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,800
problems with this is

1761
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,480
i can be like i could be pushed to the

1762
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,640
limit to the point of literally

1763
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,400
practically dying because of it but

1764
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,920
spirit will still talk because it's like

1765
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,559
your best friend still talking to

1766
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,400
did you ever have a friend where is it

1767
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,960
she's your best friend or he's your best

1768
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,040
friend

1769
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,319
but you just can't hear it right now

1770
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,640
yeah did you ever have

1771
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,319
that where you're like no i'm tired i

1772
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,520
and your friend wants to talk and wants

1773
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,040
to talk in here well

1774
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,000
guess what it's me when lou wants to

1775
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,880
turn his phone off at 9pm

1776
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
which i do so it always happens i've

1777
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,079

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,000
somebody with that yet and i've never

1779
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,119
found someone that knows advanced

1780
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
information

1781
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,280
ahead of science of research that's

1782
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,119

1784
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,240
hoping it happens because you know what

1785
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,720
i'm kind of i kind of want to

1786
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,079
be done and retire i want somebody else

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,520
to take take it over

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,280
let them take it over let them put the

1789
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,400
books out i'm um it's

1790
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,400
such a unique position has any doctors

1791
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,319
put a hit out on your head yet

1792
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,440
no you're not friends i'm friends with a

1793
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,359
lot of guys there's a lot of great

1794
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,559
doctors out there one great doctor dr

1795
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,160
alejandra younger

1796
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,920
yeah he did the forward for the first

1797
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,760
medical medium book he's he's a he's a

1798
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,599
genius he's a great doctor he's a lot of

1799
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,079
amazing doctors i know

1800
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,440
over the years i've troubleshooted for

1801
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,960
doctors that's how i

1802
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,960
that's how i've been doing this all

1803
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,839
these years doctors have been using me

1804
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,160
they actually

1805
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,319
look for the information because you

1806
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,160
know why doctors got compassion

1807
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,359
yeah they went into it originally

1808
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,160
because they don't want to see people

1809
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,000
suffer

1810
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,200
so a lot of doctors they kind of like

1811
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,480
break that ego thing

1812
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,480
and they say i want to hear what he has

1813
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,920
to say i want to know what he has to say

1814
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,559
yep so there's a lot of great doctors

1815
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,200
out there do

1816
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,480
do you um do you teach nutrition because

1817
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,960
i feel like whenever i go into like a

1818
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,760
hospital or a doctor's surgery or

1819
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,559
nutrition is so far removed from any of

1820
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,880
the

1821
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,799
the diagnosis of any illnesses ever i

1822
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,280
mean that's just my interpretation of it

1823
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,319
other people may be different but um i

1824
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,319
feel like they don't have enough

1825
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,400
knowledge in nutrition

1826
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,000
well you you can use you could see it

1827
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,680
like there's articles yeah there's

1828
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,200
there's articles on me all the time out

1829
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,480
there yeah they're like writing dozens

1830
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
of articles out there and it's actually

1831
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
really funny

1832
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,359
because they write these articles they

1833
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,880
never have any of the information right

1834
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,160
about the medical medium which is funny

1835
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,839
that always makes me laugh but that's

1836
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,040
nice

1837
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,559
then then a dietitian will come on which

1838
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,559
i know some great dietitians

1839
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,160
but a dietitian will come on and not

1840
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,319
even realize celery

1841
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,480
is an herb so they're sitting there

1842
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,559
ripping apart the celery juice movement

1843
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,079
saying it's placebo saying it doesn't

1844
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,040
work right they're saying all these

1845
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,920
things

1846
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,480
and then they're calling it a vegetable

1847
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,880
when it's an

1848
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,760
actual herb and it's just like oh my god

1849
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,119
you know and

1850
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,680
they haven't dealt with the chronic

1851
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,119
allele recovering from diseases using

1852
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,280
celery juice so they're just complete

1853
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,040
so yeah you know nutritionists

1854
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,480
dietitians i have total respect for them

1855
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,160
people in the health field movement all

1856
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,119
the health professionals respect for

1857
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,160
everybody

1858
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,000

now i gotta convince you lou here's the

1905
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,319
difference

1906
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,839
okay everybody's juiced carrots before

1907
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,799

00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:11,040
everybody's juiced

1909
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,960
everything before no one's recovered

1910
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,079
from literally death defying illnesses

1911
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,559
because of it

1912
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,319
what celery juice has okay this is an

1913
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,720
entirely different thing this is

1914
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,400
i'm so i mean we have it like full time

1915
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,480
four five times a week

1916
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,599
not quite 16 ounces though yeah you got

1917
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,000
maybe half of that

1918
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,880
you should be on 32 ounces jeez every

1919
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,599
single day

1920
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,119
you do that for 60 days and you will

1921
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,720
never go off of it again

1922
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,839
