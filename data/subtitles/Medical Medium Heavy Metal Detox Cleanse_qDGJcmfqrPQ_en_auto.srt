40
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,520
part of anxiety

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,079
heavy metals involve their brain

fog a big contributor to brain fog right

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,680
how about that one anybody deal with

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,680
that you guys depersonalization

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
how about the personalization toxic

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
heavy metal especially when we don't

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,079
know why

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
we have that depersonalization we always

56
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
try to do band-aids out there for all

57
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
these things like we're trying to do the

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,040
meditation i've seen people do that

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
for 40 years i've seen people do you

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
know all different breath work and they

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
do all kinds of positive

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
you know everything from affirmations

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,879
all the band-aids we use to try to

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
push by and and spiritually grow and

65
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,680
spiritually get better while we're

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,160
healing and all that but

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
when the toxic heavy metals are there it

68
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
gets in the way

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
it gets in the way because i've seen

70
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
people work so

71
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,560
hard to try to get their lives back

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
and try to get out of that

73
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,319
depersonalization that depression that

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
anxiety

75
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,760
and then they get hung up they're just

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
they get and they fight for it but

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
they're still

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,800
sick and that's really hard for people

79
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,040
focus and concentration issues

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640

als and more i mean we're talking about

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
toxic heavy metals

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
got to tell you guys something cleans

91
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
the heel this is this is actually

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
unbelievable i was blown away when i saw

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
this last night i don't know if you saw

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
my post all right

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,159
cleanse the heel is so low in price

96
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
right now it's it's unbelievably

97
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,599
ridiculous unprecedented

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,959
and i'm really happy about amazon.com

99
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,280
right amazon reduced it they

100
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,480
they make the price they want that's

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
what they do

102
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
and when this book first came out it was

103
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
35

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
when it first came out and it still

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
didn't even pay for itself because this

106
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
book is a medical textbook and it

107
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
costs more to print this what happened

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
is amazon lowered it and they reduced

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,599
the price they reduced the price but

110
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,959
just as of last night

111
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,440
they made it 16.99 so if you're someone

112
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
who

113
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,480
who couldn't afford it when it was 20

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
and that was 40

115
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
off if you're somebody who couldn't

116
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,000
afford it at 20 dollars

117
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,920

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,439
the library you know if you want get it

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
free at the library and don't even pay

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,920
for it don't even bother

122
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,040
but the point is it's mind-blowing i had

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
to tell you guys

124
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
you know because i got friends that are

125
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
getting more of them for more of the

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,439
books because of the price right now for

127
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
their friends and they're for family and

128
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,319
people they know

129
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
you know a backup book whatever so they

130
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
could be in a different place with it or

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
something

132
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
like that but the whole point is i had

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
to tell you guys i'm blown away

134
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
by the way these books have street cred

135
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
because millions have healed

136
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
all around the globe with medical medium

137
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,759
information

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
got their lives back all around the

139
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,280
globe and that's why we've been the

140
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
largest health community for the

141
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
chronically ill and safe space

142
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
that's ever been for people to get their

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
lives back

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
and you know and you think that would

145
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,400
make people so happy right

146
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,080
they're like oh my god there's the

147
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,759
answers and everything but you know

148
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
there's a lot of jealousy out there in

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
the in the health world

150
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
a lot of haters a lot of naysayers they

151
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
just don't like

152
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
people getting better unless they're in

153
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
control of it unless

154
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
other people in the industry have

155
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,039
control over people

156
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
but this is the largest health community

157
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,800
and safe space for the chronically ill

158
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,080
and it's really an incredible credible

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,759
thing and it's basically because i'm

160
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
discriminated against for hearing a

161
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,720
voice and that's where the information

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
comes from if you're new here

163
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
most people in the medical medium

164
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
community started their journey

165
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,880
so it's going to be part of the the

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320

170
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,479
people see a lot of doctors and they

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
don't get the answer some people skip to

192
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,440
50 doctors that's how the community was

193
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
formed

194
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
it wasn't formed because i had a great

195
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
idea

196
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
it wasn't formed because you know

197
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,600
because whatever

198
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
it was informed because there were money

199
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
behind it there was no

200
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
money behind the entire thing there was

201
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
no money behind it

202
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,520
it was formed because people saw

203
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,039
lots of doctors had no answers and

204
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
needed a way out

205
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,759
and they found the information and they

206
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
healed and that's how it worked

207
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,240
and that's how the community has been

208
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
basically constructed all that

209
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
and so i was known as the guy if

210
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
anybody's new here that you bring

211
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
bizarre symptoms to that's what it was

212
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
like all these years

213
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
and i don't do consultations so if you

214
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
see someone that's impostering me and

215
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
they're

216
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
saying they're anthony william and they

217
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,520
offer a consultation that's not me i

218
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
haven't done them for years because it's

219
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,720
all been about

220
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
getting information to the masses

221
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,639
getting information

222
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,039
so people can heal so that's what it was

223
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
all about also i don't offer classes too

224
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,039
so if someone's trying to get 500

225
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,720
400 from you or whatever it is and

226
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
they're saying they offer a class and

227
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
they're me

228
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
it's not me so always remember that i've

229
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
worked with many doctors over the years

230
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,039
helping them troubleshoot their

231
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,479
difficult cases most difficult cases

232
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,319
that's what i was known for

233
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
i've worked with hundreds of doctors

234
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
throughout the years and more

235
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,000

if you'd like for sure because we're

244
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
going to cover a lot of stuff like that

245
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,240
so keep in mind

246
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,759
keep in mind that lots of doctors read

247
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,319
the medical medium books

248
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,440
and they even say they do lots of them

249
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,039
across the country

250
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
and around the globe there's a lot of

251
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
doctors where they their ego

252
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
doesn't control or run them so it

253
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
doesn't control or run them

254
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
and they so they'll say yeah we we do

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,599
medical medium information we love

256
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,280
medical medium information

257
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
patients bring medical medium books to

258
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
doctors there's that group and there's

259
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
many doctors that actually use medical

260
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
medium information but won't admit it

261
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,560
because

262
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,560
their egos run them it's perfectly

263
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
normal so that's life it's life here on

original they're not unique and they're

286
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
in a pamphlet

287
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,080
this is actually a real book these are

288
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
textbooks they were meant for doctors

289
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
originally so

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
when i came out the medical medium first

291
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,959
book that was

292
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
meant for doctors and it was meant for

293
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,320
doctors and practitioners

294
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,560
and then but i also made i i made it

295
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
also at the same time meant for course

296
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
people who weren't doctors and

297
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,399
practitioners

298
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,760
but doctor but what happens is books

299
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,920
aren't written like that they're not

300
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,360
written also for doctors as well that's

301
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
why the books have done so good in

302
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,680

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
exposed to toxic heavy metals you guys

361
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
almost nobody believes they've been

362
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,480
exposed to a toxic heavy metal

363
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,040

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
sure

365
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
they can get sick and get their symptoms

366
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
along the way and

367
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,160
maybe if they're sick enough and they've

368
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
seen enough doctors or practitioners or

369
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,440
they lost something in their life

370
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,160
throughout the process like the quality

371
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
of life

372
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
or or impeded their life do they come to

373
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
that place

374
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
once they learn information like this

375
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,480
that wait a minute

376
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
okay is toxic heavy metals doing this

377
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
what's happening

378
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,120
if you're wondering if you have toxic

379
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,839
heavy metals and where they could come

380
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
from

381
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
these suggestions may offer

382
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
enlightenment so i just want to cover a

383
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
little bit here

384
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,399
have you ever had a stick of gum have

385
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,040
you guys ever had a stick of gum

386
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,360
that was wrapped in a foil wrapper have

387
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,200
you ever used aluminum foil at a cookout

388
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,240
what about that right aluminum foil have

389
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,959
you ever used aluminum foil at a cookout

390
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
there's some bad aluminum foils and

391
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,120
they're all bad

392
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
but there's ones that are so bad that if

393
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,720
cheese

394
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,120
if cheese touched that aluminum foil

395
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,800
in heat where there would be like a

396
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,160
reaction that occurred from

397
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,800
cheese touching aluminum foil that was

398
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,440
heated right so see you got a like nice

399
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,000
mac and cheese in the oven and you've

400
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
got

401
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
foil over the top and you've got it

402
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,399
bacon in that oven

403
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,720
flakes of aluminum foil that you can't

404
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
see and even can see sometimes it's

405
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
rainbow you can't

406
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,120
flakes of aluminum foil will literally

407
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
be all throughout the top of that mac

408
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
and cheese

409
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
people just don't know this and that

410
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,560

411
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000

448
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
out of a can soft drinks from an

449
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,079
aluminum can once

450
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,399
maybe once maybe twice still

451
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,600
what about silver fillings i know a lot

452
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,760
of people don't have

453
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
them they're not getting silver fillings

454
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
you know not like the old days

455
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
a lot of people had the silver fillings

456
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,000
but here's the thing

457
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,199
what about mom having the silver

458
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,920
fillings

459
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,199
what about dad having the silver

460
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,839
fillings

461
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,839
it passes on from generation to

462
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,399
generation to generation

463
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
you can be 30 years old right now not

464
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,920
have silver fillings

465
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,320
have a child the child can still

466
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,160
have toxic heavy metals like mercury

467
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
from that silver filling

468
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,000
because the 30 year old who doesn't have

469
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,360
any silver in their mouth

470
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,920
doesn't have any in those malgams in

471
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
their mouth has gotten the mercury from

472
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,279
mom and dad who

473
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,720
had the mercury fillings or their mom

474
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,959
and dad that's how

475
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
mercury works it goes down the line just

476
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
like that okay and you guys don't have

477
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,920
to be scared it's not about that

478
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,600
and you know look it's just about

479
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,839

right i don't want you scared of

484
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
silverware it's not about that

485
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,959
it's literally about let's get the

486
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,839
medals out while we're living our life

487
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,360
down here

488
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,360
you know let's get the medals out why

489
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
we're like trying to like live

490
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
and that's what it's about it's about

491
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
empowerment you guys know this i don't

492
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
know

493
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
maybe the new people here might not be

494
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,600
aware of this yet but medical medium

495
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
information has always been about

496
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,120
empowerment in fact

497
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
when the first medical media book came

498
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,240
on the scene it was the only

499
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,600
medical empowerment book out and i'm not

500
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,639
talking about spiritual about

501
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,560
medical empowerment having answers it

502
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,360
was the old first time boom there was

503
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,720
there was actually

504
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,079
answers to why we're sick it's all about

505
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
that so

506
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,360
many people have been exposed to mercury

507
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
throughout the you know throughout those

508
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,880
dental fillings

509
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
having them removed you know isn't just

510
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,000
an easy fix either

511
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
you know that's how we also get more

512
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
mercury in this but even though we have

513
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,639
to get some

514
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,320
removed over time because they break

515
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
like i talk about or crack or the tooth

516
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
cracks or something that's when you get

517
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
them out

518
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,959
the extraction process can be re-exposed

519
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
you know can be a re-exposure for

520
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,120
someone with the mercury fillings

521
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,399
because it emits mercury vapor

522
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
throughout the bloodstream that's why i

523
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,880
recommend only having one silver filling

524
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,959
removed per dentist visit

525
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,560
and that's only if the silver filling is

526
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
starting to fall apart or loosen or if

527
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
there's a problem with the tooth

528
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
so we're gonna be reading we're gonna

529
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
i'm gonna walk you through the heavy

530
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,920
metal detox cleanse

531
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,920
so that's what we're going to do have

532
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
you ever had a fluoride treatment

533
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,519
yeah right how many people had a

534
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680
fluoride treatment even if not recently

535
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,400
have you had one at any point over the

536
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,400
years perhaps going back to childhood

537
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,839
the fluoride used for treatments is a

538
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,120
byproduct of aluminum

539
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,280
a methyl aluminum neurotoxin created

540
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,360
from manufacturing aluminum

541
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,520
almost all of us have been exposed to it

542
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
in one way or another

543
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,480
and whether from fluoride treatments

544
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,280
from toothpaste or fluoridated tap water

545
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,799
and if we're if we have that exposure it

546
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
hasn't left our bodies unless we've

547
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,160
taken the proper

548
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,320
steps to remove it make sure if you're

549
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
worried about fluoridated tap water

550
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,679
if you're worried about these things in

551
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,640
your tap water make sure you have a

552
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,840
water pure

553
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,080
of fire not a water filter not not

554
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,520
a water not an alkaline water ionizer

555
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
machine that doesn't take care of these

556
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,919
things

557
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,760
most of these things it just won't make

558
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
sure it's a water purifier if you're

559
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,559
really worried about what's in your

560
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
water and i've been saying that to

561
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,640
people

562
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,559
forever speaking of tap water town and

563
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,360
city water supplies

564
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
all have trace levels of toxic heavy

565
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,320
metals such

566
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
as lead arsenic copper aluminum and even

567
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
mercury

568
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,679
they're deemed safe enough for

569
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
consumption without true knowledge of

570
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,240
what happens

571
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
when those trace minerals accumulate in

572
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,840
our body so we drink the tap water and

573
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,840
those metals accumulate in our body

574
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,440
that's what happens we drink them we

575
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,480
drink the tap water and

576
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,000
our those metals accumulate in our body

577
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
and i just don't want confusion because

578
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
people say well my alkaline ionizer

579
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
water machine takes care of all that in

580
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
the tap water it doesn't

581
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
it doesn't so it's very important to

582
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,520
know these things

583
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,039
so we you know and i've talked about

584
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,039
that before but i just want to make sure

585
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,240
since we're talking about water

586
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,679
that that's clear so you know ro takes

587
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
care of it other things take care of it

588
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
that's it

589
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
you know that's the whole thing so even

590
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,200
if you have a water filtration system at

591
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,840
home a good one like a purifier

592
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,559
a purifier you're exposed when eating

593
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,720
out

594
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,480
so we're exposed when eating out you

595
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,160
guys consider for example getting a

596
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,080
coffee at your favorite coffee shop

workout whatever it is

615
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
the point is is that water is not

616
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
filtered like you think it is it's just

617
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
not

618
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,760
so i just want to be straight up about

619
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,120
this stuff it's like what do i do do i

620
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,360
not tell you guys the truth and just

621
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,000
play neutral 24 7 and you guys pay the

622
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,240
price

623
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
or do i say it like it is and take all

624
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,360
the crap i get

625
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,320
24 7 from all the naysayers and haters

626
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,640
and everybody else

627
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,720
i'd rather have your back that's better

628
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,039
because then i could sleep at night

629
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
you know so here's the deal so you know

630
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,000
so you know

631
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,160
one cup of coffee made from the shops

632
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
tap water seems perfectly safe

633
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,559
but it's not one does you know and so

634
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,960
does one glass of tap water

635
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,640
at a restaurant seems perfectly safe but

636
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,039
it's not so does one

637
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
you know one ice in a restaurant that's

638
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
another thing

639
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520

642
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,720
hooked up has anybody ever had that

643
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
before soda from like a restaurant

644
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,760
right no one thinks about what happens

645
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,720
after 10 years of stopping by

646
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,559
for your coffee every day of how many

647
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
medals accumulate right

648
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,320
you know it's like you know i was

649
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,919
thought about it i thought about it and

650
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
i was like okay do i want to drop the

651
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,799
medals

652
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
the talk about medals and everything and

653
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,600
i'm like yeah like

654
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
aren't they supposed to know isn't

655
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,400
everybody supposed to know

656
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,880
because okay live in denial or be afraid

657
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
or

658
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
learn and learn how to get metals out

659
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,400
and heal i mean

660
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
right it's the only thing that makes

661
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,159
sense

662
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,280
um so you know we get accumulations of

663
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
lead aluminum

664
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,480
arsenic mercury copper and what happens

665
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,720
when they get in our brain over time

666
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,799

pre-made though

672
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
because you know it's i'd be hard right

673
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
now to get a blender get everything else

674
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,799

unknown to research in science and and

682
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
only known to the medical medium

683
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
information

684
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,640
copper plays a role copper inside her

685
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,760
liver plays a role

686
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,600

687
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,120
consuming food cooked food that have

been used

689
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,640
metal utensils oh my god so many

690
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,799
restaurants

691
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,280
they beat the crap out of the bottom of

692
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,480
those

693
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,080
pots with metal tools and they're making

694
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
and they're doing the sauce in there and

695
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,880
they're

696
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
doing this like that and all these pots

697
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
i know people that i know people that

698
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
own restaurants i know people that

699
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,559
worked in restaurants

700
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
and the pots i remember being at my

701
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,120
friend's restaurant and standing there

702
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
in the back kitchen

703
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,480
and i would look at the pots they were

704
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
high quality but

705
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,080
the amount of gouges that were on the

706
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
bottom of that

707
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
pot i'm like where did i said to my

708
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,280
friend where do you think all this went

709
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,039
it's like what do you mean those are

710
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,120
high quality pots those are 150

711
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
a piece i'm like where do you think all

712
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,679
that metal went

713
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,159
it went into everybody's meals everybody

714
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
not at my restaurant no in everybody's

715
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,760
restaurant

716
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,679
um so anyway isn't this fun

717
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
it's probably annoying right all right

718
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,799
so restaurants are one of the most

719
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,840
common sources of toxic heavy metal

720
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,720
exposure

721
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
not that it's anybody's fault the

722
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
well-meaning restaurant

723
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,880
you know owner of course we just need to

724
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,600
work on taking the medals out if we want

725
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,679
to play

726
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,960
if you guys want to play reindeer games

727
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,720
out there right

728
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,200
if we want to play reindeer games and

729
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,880
live you know we want to be a roman

730
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
live like what all the romans and we

731
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,280
want to do that then

732
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
we got to also be proactive about taking

733
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
care of ourselves

734
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,000
or we just end up with dementia way down

735
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,080
the road or memory problems

736
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,720
or or whatever everything i was talking

wild blueberry kiss medical medium

739
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,720
protocols have significantly shifted my

740

psoriasis

741
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,880

i love when people want to pin me down

747
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520

839
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,080
are like bones cut and other things

840
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,880
machinery

841
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,679
grease on machinery i've seen i know

842
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,600
that when

843
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200

i

846
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,799
we got animal protein people here we got

847
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,559
vegans plant-based people here

848
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
because this is about answers not about

849
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,440
what diet belief system is better or not

850
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,400
right

851
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,080
and when they're cutting up the cow

852
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
they're using machines

853
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
you know bone broth people don't know

854
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,039
that when to cut that

855
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,919
bone there's grease which has metal in

856
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,880
it

857
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
with a saw blade like one of those saw

858
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,520
blades

859
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,039
that cuts through those bone pieces so

860
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520
you can make your bone broth

861
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,000
the amount of metal people get in bone

862
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,240
broth is unbelievable and no one knows

863
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,840
it so let's do something to get it out

864
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,720
nobody knows this stuff

865
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,159
and um and and you know and all of that

866
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
you know it's the whole bit you wouldn't

867
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,039
believe what they have to do for tools

868
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,919
when when they're cutting grass-fed beef

869
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,279
up you wouldn't believe

870
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,440
because those knives dull so quick

871
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,880
going through all that it's unbelievable

872
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
it's just to resharp and resharp and

873
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,559
resharp and metal metal metal and then

874
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,320
the grass fed the grass is still got

875
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,520
metals on the grass

876
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,520
it comes out of the sky it's in jet fuel

877
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,240
it's dropping from all over the places

878
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,520
it's in it's in ddt that floats around

879
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,120
the atmosphere

880
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,760
it's in it's in uh chemtrails

881
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,840
metal is dumping out of chemtrails

882
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,880
pouring out of chemtrails

883
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,840
on everyone okay it's not about being

884
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
afraid

885
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,080
i'm not afraid because i have the tools

886
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,480
to get the medals out

887
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,240
that's the whole point as simple as that

888
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
and listen if you guys think i have an

889
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,000
ego you know people are like oh he's got

890
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
an ego it's just for saying nobody knows

891
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
this

892
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,520
this what am i gonna do am i gonna what

893
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,279
am i gonna do am i not gonna be truthful

894
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
okay am i not gonna be truthful about

895
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,880
unique published information

896
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,039
in these books that my publisher knows

897
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,520
these books aren't cited for a reason

898
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,120
i can't get away with doing medical

899
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,240
books without citing

900
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,320
every single thing of where it came from

901
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,000
and there's no citations in these

902
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,600
the reason why there's no citations in

903
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,159
these it's all original

904
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,919
and unique so am i going to just pretend

905
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,760
that everybody knows all this so you can

906
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,600
go get information over there

907
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,440
the problem is when you go over there

908
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,200
you don't get the whole story

909
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
or you don't get all the information you

910
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,840
need and then you end up like blueberry

911
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,640
kiss she tried everything for 30 years

912
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,080
until she got rid of her psoriasis

913
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
through the medical medium information

914
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,760
but if i don't let people

915
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
know that how are they going to know how

916
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,640
are they going to know

917
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
all the things that that are original in

918
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
here how

919
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,679
you know and it's kind of sad it's like

920
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,200
it's like the whole thing is like one of

921
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,039
you know the whole thing about that is

922
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,399
really interesting is

923
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,919
how are people going to find their way

924
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
to get the answers so that's what it's

925
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,440

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,600
when it comes down to that and in the

935
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,039
air we breathe the toxic heavy metals

936
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,840
are coming out of exhaust

937
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,279
that too i mean listen there's so many

938
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,520
places you guys can get toxic heavy

939
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,600
metals it's

940
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,159
unbelievable unbelievable and

941
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,080
and um but yeah if you want you can call

942
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
it an ego i don't care that's fine with

943
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
me

944
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,120
i call it just you know hey i'm gonna

945
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,080
say the truth of where it comes from

946
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,039
i've helped 30

947
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,000
for 35 years i helped over 250 000

948
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,080
individuals one-on-one for 35 years

949
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
before publishing the medical medium

950
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,279
books i didn't appear

951
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,600
out of social media thin air like boom

952
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,360
and that's why when you look here

953
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
and you'll see millions of copies sold

954
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,880
of the medical media book series

955
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,080
millions around the world

956
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,720
that's because the platform isn't social

957
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,559
media

958
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
it's everywhere around the world in

959
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,080
almost every country in the world

960
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,520
and that's how many people are healing i

961
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,399
just for any new people because i know

962
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
they're going to come across

963
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,320
and say wait a minute my this other

964
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,159
person i know talks about medals

965
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
well we're going to talk we talk about

966
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,559
things and what's happening like nobody

967
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,240
does it's important so let's go

968
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,000
here we are and um

969
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,440
i want to go into a little bit more here

970
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,440
too there's so much information

971
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
truth is many varieties of toxic heavy

972
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,919
metals build up in us

973
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,279
over time they build up anus over time

974
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,279
and these are only some of the

975
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,080
opportunities we have in us for toxic

976
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,840
heavy metals

977
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,159
for collecting toxic heavy metals in our

978
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,279
bodies toxic heavy metals are hidden

979
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,399
and unseeable we don't see it we don't

980
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,039
think we have a problem

981
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,960
technology is not up to par for finding

982
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,799
out about toxic heavy metals

983
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,080
technology can't see the decaying

984
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:15,760
flesh inside our brains with alzheimer's

985
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,720
from oxidative material byproduct

986
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,159
oxidating and rusting off of pockets of

987
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,640
toxic heavy metals

988
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,039
and then leaching into adjacent tissue

989
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
and and making it impossible for someone

990
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,840
to heal

991
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,880
with alzheimer's unless they get metals

992
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,880
out hair testing doesn't do the trick

993
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
it doesn't hair testing doesn't do the

994
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
trick because

995
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,519
the metals are in our organs that's

996
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
where the metals go unless you just got

997
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,159
brand new exposure a heavy dosage and

998
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
then you can

999
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
check it in the bloodstream and but

1000
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,840
that's only for a day or two after

1001
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
a day or two boom it's in organs and

1002
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,240
that's where it goes

1003
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,159
so toxic heavy metals are hidden and

1004
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,200
unseeable it's impossible to witness

1005
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,440
that they reside within us you guys

1006
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,120
it's hard to see that no technology has

1007
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,120
been created yet to truly determine the

1008
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,760
toxic heavy metals inside our organs the

1009
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,159
need

1010
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,799
for such technology isn't even on

1011
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,679
research and sciences radar okay wait a

1012
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,000
minute here

1013
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,519
research in science doesn't care about

1014
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,760
metals inside of us

1015
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,519
you guys know this you guys know how

1016
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,919
controversial medals are

1017
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,919
so many of you guys do right season you

1018
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,799
know like you guys are seasoned

1019
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,679
and research and science doesn't care

1020
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,760
about metals

1021
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,200
they don't care about metals with

1022
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,559
anxiety depression

1023
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
all the different conditions i talked

1024
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,679
about focusing concentration brain fog

1025
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,000
they don't care

1026
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,320
well so let's go into a little bit while

1027
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,679
direct exposure to a large amount of

1028
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,679
heavy metal

1029
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,760
such as lead can be detected in the

1030
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,919
bloodstream temporarily

1031
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,279
all the other exposure that we get just

1032
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
goes and goes and goes

1033
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,440
into organs that's the whole point

1034
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,440
instead medical research and science

1035
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,440
tends to blame chronic illness on our

1036
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
faulty bodies and genes that's how it

1037
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,919
works the research

1038
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
research of science doesn't want to know

1039
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,840
it's toxic heavy metals

1040
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,799
research in science wants to think it's

1041
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,279
your genes

1042
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,039
research in science wants to think it's

1043
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,159
your body attacking itself

1044
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,279
alternative research in science

1045
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,640
alternative wants to believe it's your

1046
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,200
body attacking itself

1047
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,960
when you crack down to it it goes right

1048
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,399
down to conventional did you know that

1049
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,000
that alternative medicine

1050
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,000
still is is is basically the puppy dog

1051
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,320
for conventional medicine in so many

1052
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,919
ways alternative medicine will still

1053
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,360
be like no it's your fault in the end

1054
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,480
and then spiritual medicine will tell

1055
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
you that you created

1056
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,440
created it with your own thoughts and

1057
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,799
that's why you're sick spiritual

1058
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
alternative medicine and that's not the

1059
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,840
way to go i mean plans to heal right now

1060
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,559
if you guys don't know it's 16 it's it's

1061
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,799
51

1062
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,399
off at amazon.com i've never seen that

1063
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,559
before ever it's really amazing so let's

1064
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,039
go into this a little bit more

1065
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
what toxic heavy metals do to us let's

1066
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,240
go into this

1067
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and then i'm going to walk you through

1068
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,039
the medical medium heavy metal detox

1069
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,080
cleanse

1070
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,000
much as we may not want to believe it we

1071
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
all have toxic heavy metals inside our

1072
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,200
bodies

1073
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,960
mercury aluminum copper lead nickel

1074
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
cadmium barium arsenic

1075
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,440
and toxic calcium accumulate in

1076
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,879
different areas of different organs

1077
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,200
the two most popular places that gather

1078
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,119
are in the brain and the liver that's

1079
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,399
the spots they gather that's where it

1080
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,240
goes

1081
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,599
toxic heavy metals carry a disruptive

1082
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,280
charge that interferes with the

1083
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,560
electricity that travels through your

1084
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,040
brain

1085
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,879
toxic heavy metals interfere with the

1086
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
electrical impulses all that electricity

1087
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,800
that runs to our brain that's swimming

1088
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,520
around

1089
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,599
so really important to know

1090
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,919
neurotransmitter chemicals

1091
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,159
are meant to use the electrical neural

1092
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,960
highway there to carry information

1093
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,679
and life force to every cell in your

1094
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
brain

1095
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,879
when toxic heavy metals such as mercury

1096
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,040
and aluminum are

1097
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,760
present or present electrical impulses

1098
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,879
weaken

1099
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,760
as they hit these deposits electrical

1100
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,960
impulses

1101
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,079
weaken as they hit all of these deposits

1102
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,960
so important to know electrical activity

1103
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,240
becomes diffused and that's why we get

1104
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,160
that depression

1105
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,440
why am i depressed why do i have

1106
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,599
depersonalization

1107
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,520
why do i have anxiety what about brain

1108
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,839
fog focus and concentration issues

1109
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
why do i have all these problems

1110
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,119
electrical activity becomes diffused and

1111
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,960
that leads to a host

1112
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,960
of symptoms and conditions that can

1113
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,920
develop over a lifetime

1114
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,760
brain fog memory issues confusion

1115
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,960
anxiety you guys dealing with any

1116
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,720
anxiety that you're like well i don't

1117
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,320
know why i have anxiety i shouldn't

1118
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,599
this other person is also stressed out

1119
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,440
and they don't have anxiety but i'm

1120
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,839
stressed out and i do

1121
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,520
got to get the medals out depression are

1122
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,560
just a few toxic heavy metals in the

1123
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,440
brain can lead to

1124
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,960
alzheimer's disease dementia als

1125
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,520
parkinson's and even die

1126
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,200
and even diagnosis is such bipolar mania

1127
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,079
and schizophrenia so it's important now

1128
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
this is advanced

1129
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,359
unique information people don't know

1130
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,320
that out there that's not

1131
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,880
out there so um and i have to tell you

1132
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,359
because

1133
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,079
it's not it it all these illnesses and

1134
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,440
diseases and metals being the cause

1135
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,040
is actually originally all medical

1136
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
medium information and just letting

1137
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
people know

1138
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
and and it's important you know a doctor

1139
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,880
friend of mine tells me

1140
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,560
your information's unique why aren't you

1141
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,720
telling them that because then they're

1142
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,720
kind of like they don't know they think

1143
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,480
it's somewhere else or they think that

1144
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,240
everybody has this or

1145
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,440
and then they get lost and they can't

1146
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,200
they can't heal because they're just

1147
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,800
going to go spinning around

1148
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
and a doctor friend told me that by the

1149
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,920
way i'm going to have um a doctor friend

1150
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,079
on

1151
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,839
live coming up and i'll let you guys

1152
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,359
know when it is but i'm going to have a

1153
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,800
guest on and we're going to split the

1154
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,839
screen and we're going to do this it's

1155
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,520
going to be great

1156
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,760
anyway there's so much good stuff coming

1157
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,640
i'm so excited by the way

1158
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,480
so let's go into a little bit more here

1159
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,240
it's not only that heavy metal deposits

1160
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
themselves can be a problem so having a

1161
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,320
heavy metal deposit in our brain can be

1162
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,920
a problem all right toxic

1163
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:01,359
heavy metals oxidize inside

1164
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,400
our body they oxidize

1165
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,160
they actually oxidize and

1166
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,560
that's the problem and they discharge a

1167
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,440
byproduct

1168
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
that's why we get sick is a big piece of

1169
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,560
it

1170
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,440
that's why we get sicker in so many ways

1171
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,680
you guys

1172
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,480
because not only do we have the metal

1173
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,119
deposits

1174
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,160
inside our brain and inside our body in

1175
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,599
other places

1176
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,720
it starts to get old it starts to

1177
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
oxidize

1178
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,560
it starts to discharge and when it's

1179
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,119
discharging

1180
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,320
we get sicker the memory starts going

1181
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,240
starts going more

1182
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
starts going more anxiety starts getting

1183
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,839
worse starts getting worse more

1184
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,280
all these things because the metals are

1185
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,200
oxidizing and then

1186
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,960
if we learn how to eat better we can

1187
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
kind of curve it a little bit okay

1188
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,400
we can curve it because we're doing

1189
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,920
something to help at least get some of

1190
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,599
the oxidation out but not

1191
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,160
enough so let's go in here a little bit

1192
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,160
more okay

1193
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,160
okay so we're heading to the heavy metal

1194
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,359
detox cleanse

1195
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,400
i'm gonna cleanse the heel right here

1196
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,640
i'm glad to be here you guys okay

1197
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,560
and by now you can see the value

1198
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,920
of getting toxic heavy metals out of

1199
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
your body i'm just reading straight out

1200
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,880
of here

1201
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,480
all right the heavy metal detox cleanse

1202
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,240
is critical for anyone struggling with

1203
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
the above symptoms and conditions and

1204
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,599
also critical for eczema

1205
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,800
psoriasis critical for eczema

1206
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,440
and psoriasis because nobody knew

1207
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
that copra was the problem like one of

1208
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,560
the big

1209
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,079
issues with x-men psoriasis until the

1210
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,560
medical medium information

1211
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,400
that's why there's miraculous excellent

1212
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,800
psoriasis stories

1213
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,800
thousands of them around the world

1214
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,280
thousands of people healing it

1215
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,800
and no one's seen that before it brings

1216
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
me a lot more hate though

1217
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,480
brings a lot more associations and

1218
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,119
groups

1219
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,920
and medical this and this and this they

1220
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,000
don't like that

1221
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,200
they don't like people healing to that

1222
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,359
degree

1223
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,200
that they just don't like it it's not

1224
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,920
just about fruits and vegetables that

1225
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,320
game is

1226
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,760
that game is is cute and all oh just

1227
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,880
fruits and vegetables and no processed

1228
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,960
foods um

1229
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,400
no it's not you can do fruits and

1230
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,920
vegetables no processed foods and i've

1231
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,520
seen people they can't even put a shirt

1232
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,839
on their ex was so bad they're

1233
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,880
suffering suffering unless they know

1234
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,480
about getting

1235
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,079
the copper out so important you guys it

1236
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,240
really is

1237
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,520
ex excellent psoriasis or signs of

1238
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,400
someone dealing with

1239
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,359
an elevation of toxic copper inside the

1240
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,119
liver

1241
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,800
where epstein-barr is also present

1242
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,160
because you need a pathogen such as

1243
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
epstein-barr to feed

1244
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,599
off of the copper and the copper

1245
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,160
by-product

1246
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,480
and then when the virus that everybody

1247
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,400
has inside of us feeds off of that

1248
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,160
copper it releases a dermatoxin

1249
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,160
so the people with excellent psoriasis

1250
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,920
have the copper

1251
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,119
unlike somebody else who doesn't have

1252
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,480
the copper somebody else could have

1253
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,960
chronic fatigue syndrome

1254
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,880
because they have the epstein-barr okay

1255
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,880
but they don't have the copper

1256
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,400
and somebody else will have the copper

1257
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
and the epstein bar is feeding off the

1258
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,839
copper

1259
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,839
releasing a poison when the poison's

1260
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,920
released it's called a dermatoxin

1261
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,440
that's a advanced information ahead of

1262
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
science and research and doctors are

1263
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,800
actually looking to these books

1264
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,079
because of this now and then that

1265
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
dermatoxin

1266
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,839
goes to the skin especially when the

1267
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,240
liver is toxic sluggish

1268
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,000
and it goes to the skin and it creates

1269
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,680
those eruptions and the rashes and

1270
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
everything else

1271
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,640
the dermatoxin is pushed into the

1272
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,240
bloodstream and that's what happens from

1273
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,680
the liver so

1274
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
i'll talk about some other thing

1275
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,480
vitiligo is an

1276
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,960
overload of aluminum

1277
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,640
over a load of aluminum inside the liver

1278
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,000
that's vitiligo so you might be a

1279
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
vitiligo sufferer

1280
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,760
and you've already had damaged pigment

1281
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,640
in your skin the melanin you've already

1282
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,760
had that

1283
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,280
but you know it'll keep on continuing on

1284
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,640
and off oh sure if you eat better take

1285
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,960
away processed foods and

1286
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,160
eat cleaner eat clean paleo eat clean

1287
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
plant-based eat clean

1288
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,079
high protein keto whatever you want to

1289
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,000
do and you can slow it down

1290
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,280
because you're at least giving your body

1291
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,520
a chance for the liver to

1292
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
to clean a little better the bloodstream

1293
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,839
to flow a little bit better

1294
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,079
but the vitiligo can still not only not

1295
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,079
heal but keep on getting worse as the

1296
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,359
years go by until you address the

1297
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,720
aluminum inside the liver

1298
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,400
and young children with levels of

1299
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,920
undetected mercury and aluminum inside

1300
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
the liver and brain often deal with

1301
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,640
attention deficit hyperactivity

1302

symptoms can shape who we are they

1316
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,520

and they become our story

1319
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,040

celery juice comes next to loosen

1453
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,599
up metals preparing them to be gathered

1454
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,400
up by the heavy metal detox smoothie

1455
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,040
so it takes more than just the lemon

1456
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,079
water

1457
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,880
to loosen these up okay the celery juice

1458
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,960
is the next

1459
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,560
phase to loosen up these toxic heavy

1460
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,880
metals getting them

1461
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,599

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,040
that's really important okay celery

1464
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,720
juice also helps restore areas

1465
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,480
where the toxic heavy metals cause

1466
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,680
damage they cause damage

1467
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,400
metals sit and rust and rot

1468
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,119
that's what they do and they sit and

1469
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,920
they hurt

1470
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,040
cells they hurt tissue that's what

1471
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,079
metals do

1472
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,839
okay well you remove the metals you

1473
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,440
still got the damaged tissue you still

1474
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,720
got the cells in it you know they still

1475
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,319
got the neurotransmitters

1476
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,800
electrical impulse problems still got

1477
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,000
all this stuff but what's fixing it

1478
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,040
what's helping fix

1479
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,680
it that's the whole point and so celery

1480
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,760
juice

1481
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,680
also helps restore areas inside organs

1482
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,240
that have been damaged by toxic

1483
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,520
heavy metals while the sodium cluster

1484
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,400
salts

1485
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,200
not sodium sodium cluster salts which is

1486
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,280
a subgroup

1487
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,720
of sodium undiscovered by research in

1488
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,160
science i talked about it

1489
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,079
all through the medical medium books

1490
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,960
okay you can look into it

1491
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,559
sodium cluster salts the undiscovered

1492
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,839
subgroup of sodium that science and

1493
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,920
research has not

1494
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,920
uncovered yet and i don't think they're

1495
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,839
going to care to look to be honest

1496
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,800
because mainstream media just loves to

1497
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,800
say sorry juice doesn't work

1498
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,400
meanwhile we know what happened with how

1499
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,880
the whole world has changed because of

1500
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,760
it

1501
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,839
um so that's it's amazing basically the

1502
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,960
sodium cluster salts and celery juice

1503
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,839
you guys

1504
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,400
helps disarm the toxic heavy metal

1505
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:25,599
charge metals inside our body

1506
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,800
have a destructive charge aluminum

1507
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,920
lead mercury arsenic all of it copper

1508
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,760
has a destructive charge the celery

1509
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,079
juice the sodium cluster salted celery

1510
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,319
juice

1511
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,839
help to disarm that charge to make them

1512
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,440
less aggressive

1513
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:44,240
and make them more malleable malleable

1514
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,960
for the next phase of the heavy metal

1515
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,359
detox cleanse so let's go into there

1516
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,200

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,440
you want longer too if you want a little

1518
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,880
bit longer you drink the heavy metal

it's incredible and that smoothie right

1550
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,520
there

1551
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,359
is in millions of people's homes right

1552
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,160
now in in almost every country in the

1553
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,200
world

1554
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,480
and you know it it's really important to

1555
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,520
know this all right so let's go

1556
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,599
so i saw a comment i think about okay

1557
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,880
someone earlier or somebody earlier said

1558
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,760
that spirulina

1559
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,960
has too much copper okay it doesn't

1560
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,079
that's the whole thing

1561
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,359
and what happens is here is that there's

1562
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:23,440
bad copper bad copper that's the

1563
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,119
difference right there okay

1564
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,280
hard bad copper from copper pipes

1565
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,480
from other sources that we have copper

1566
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,559
passed down to us

1567
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,400
from fungicides that's on your clothing

1568
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,760
so here's the difference

1569
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,599
the copper inside a fungicide

1570
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,960
that's on your brand new clothing that

1571
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,720
you try on

1572
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,119
that gets into our body and inside our

1573
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,280
liver is not the same copper that's in

1574
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,400
fruits not the same copper that's in

1575
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,880
vegetables

1576
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,440
not the same copper that's in herbs not

1577
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,880
the same copper that's in spirulina

1578
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,200
it's not the same copper that's trace

1579
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,920
mineral that's trace mineral copper

1580
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,319
that's in

1581
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,359
all of our foods so i just don't want

1582
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,119
that confusion

1583
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,359
so it's really a good question right

1584
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,319
there there's trace minerals in

1585
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,520
all of our foods that's different than a

1586
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,880
copper pipe

1587
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,280
that's decaying with hard toxic copper

1588
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,960
destructive charge that's not a food

1589
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
that's getting into our bodies

1590
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,319
from all these different on all these

1591
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,880
different levels you know

1592
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,319
and a high quality spirulina like you

1593
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,920
know if you look at the directory you'll

1594
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,160
see in the back of the book and the

1595
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,240
medical medium.com you go to directory

1596
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,680
you'll see high quality spirulina you

1597
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,520
don't it's even

1598
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,200
even better no matter what all the way

1599
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,200
so let's go into this a little bit i

1600
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,640
know the vimergy uh one

1601
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,440
the vimergy spirulina has been tested

1602
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,559
tested they actually test it

1603
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,119
independently

1604
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,040
for toxic heavy metals they test it

1605
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,800
independently of energy

1606
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,079
and that doesn't happen everywhere else

1607
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,079
that's really rare

1608
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,240
so that's what's incredible and it's not

1609
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,480
grown it's not grown

1610
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,680
in the ocean either so that's another

1611
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,040
thing so not only is the

1612
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,079
vimergy spirulina tested independently

1613
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,839
for toxic heavy metals they pay for that

1614
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,280
the amount of cost that is other

1615
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,359
companies they don't do that the amount

1616
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,359
of cost for that is unbelievable

1617
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,880
it's not grown in the ocean where you

1618
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,319
have toxic heavy metals in the ocean

1619
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,760
either so it's another thing too so

1620
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,119
let's go into this a little bit more and

1621
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,680

1622
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,520

i actually make my own applesauce i love

1667
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,640
that and

1668
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,480
if you don't want to make your own fresh

1669
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,319
applesauce you know and you want to find

1670
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,359
an applesauce that has no preservatives

1671
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,079
a cooked one

1672
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,920
that's in a glass jar that's fine too if

1673
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,559
you can't find apples write pears for

1674
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,000
snacks

1675
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,440
so that's important too so let's go in

1676
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,599
here a little bit and i'm going to go

1677
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,240
into the why with the apples

1678
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,960
if you're hungry later in the morning

1679
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,880
apples are an

1680
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,119
excellent snack because they're a

1681
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,480
powerful medicinal cleansing food i'm

1682
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,480
reading right of the book here

1683
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,319
the pectin in apples helps absorb bile

1684
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,000
coming from the liver into the

1685
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,599
intestinal tract

1686
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,160
bile that may have traces of toxic heavy

1687
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
metals

1688
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,480
in it due to everything that we're

1689
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,200
dealing with

1690
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,960
a liver filled with metals all of it a

1691
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,640
liver filled with metals you name it

1692
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,400
and the heavy metal detox smoothie is

1693
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
uprooting metals

1694
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,960
everywhere so if you have traces that

1695
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,640
are in the bile because the heavy metal

1696
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,240
detox smoothie is uprooting it and

1697
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,839
taking out of the body

1698
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,440
the apples is a great snack because it

1699
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,079
even helps to absorb that bile that

1700
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,480
could have

1701
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,839
some of that you know extra metal but

1702
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,520
that's what's incredible about it so

1703
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,599
there's a reason

1704
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,359
you're keeping your morning free from

1705
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,680

1707
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,440

second you guys

1785
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,119
hi anthony i was doing the heavy metal

1786
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,880
detox movie every day but i felt

1787
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,960
suddenly sickened by them

1788
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,000
you were doing it every day for how long

1789
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,200
quite a while

1790
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,280
it could have been something else that

1791
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,839
easily could have tripped you up i was

1792
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,559
having symptoms of too many minerals

1793
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,319
is it possible that one teaspoon of

1794
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,839
spirulina and barley grass juice powder

1795
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,640
could be too much no that's actually the

1796
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,119
minimum

1797
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,000
and it's a tiny amount um what else were

1798
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,839
you eating that day

1799
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,160
the day before what was happening during

1800
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:15,359
that week are you up against any stress

1801
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,400
any emotional stuff happening um what

1802
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:19,839
products are you using um all these

1803
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,880
things matter

1804
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,839
and and how would you know the minerals

1805
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,480
are tripping you up

1806
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,280
like where'd that information come from

1807
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,280
um

1808
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,359
all these things matter the the smoothie

1809
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,520
is so gentle and benign

1810
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,799
um it's unbelievable compared to what's

1811
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,200
out there it's incredible

1812
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,720
i mean anything i mean there's so many

1813
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,319
different things that could have got you

1814
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,240
could have got you down for a little bit

1815
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,640
so what i'm saying is don't give up

1816
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,599
um and you know bring it back in when

1817
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,960
you get a chance or

1818
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,839
you know or talk to your practitioner

1819
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,000
your doctor or however bring it back in

1820
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,160
slowly

1821
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,599
if you'd like which i tell people to do

1822
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,880
is you bring it back slowly if i ever

1823
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,280
see something like that

1824
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,640
what happens is too is we we have other

1825
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,960
things happening

1826
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,720
in our body and it's good to actually

1827
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,640
always know that hey wait a minute here

1828
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,040
i've been doing the smoothie for a while

1829
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,680
um didn't have any problems with it so

1830
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,119
make sure you

1831
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,599
you can always try to bring it back

1832
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,280
another thing is do a small amount

1833
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,599
you can do small amount do a half

1834
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,640
teaspoon do a quarter teaspoon do a

1835
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,319
much small one and the heavy metal detox

1836
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,240
smoothie can't cause neurological

1837
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,119
symptoms so that's one thing it can't

1838
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,839
cause

1839
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,760
um pathogens cause neurological symptoms

1840
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,359
