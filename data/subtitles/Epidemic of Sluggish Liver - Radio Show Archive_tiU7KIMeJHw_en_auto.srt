difficult world when it comes down to

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,960
chronic illness science and research is

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,760
behind the times with chronic illness

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,680
it's ahead of the times with so many

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,160
awesome things it really is and

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,079
including in medicine life-saving

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,760
medicine without a doubt we're we're way

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,480
ahead to where we were before but not in

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,120
chronic illness not in chronic

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,879
illness and Today's Show is about

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,119
sluggish liver sluggish liver is a term

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,119
that I've actually been using all these

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,080
decades in and and working with people

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
and everything sluggish liver is is

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,520
that's that's where it's derived from

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
this isn't fatty liver this isn't fatty

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,840
liver this is sluggish liver someone

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,759
said to me wait a minute never heard

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,159
sluggish liver yeah because that that's

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,920
that's the thing that I've been actually

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,280
trying to teach people along the way so

40
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,640
they know what's going on so you can

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,360
kind of see the symptoms and everything

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,880
and what's scary about sluggish liver

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,720
about the liver being stagnant and

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,159
sluggish what's spooky about that well

45
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,640
you can get all kinds of different

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,240
things all kinds of different illnesses

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
and diseases and everything else and

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,200
that's what we have to avoid our liver

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,520
gets filled up with all kinds of toxins

50
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,600
and poisons I'm going to go into it but

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm also going to show you the signs so

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,719

it comes down to the liver with getting

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,800
rid of a sluggish liver and and a

64
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,080
sluggish liver isn't just about having

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
weight gain you can have no weight

66
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,760
coming on and have a sluggish liver I'm

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
going to talk about this this is really

68
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,920
an important episode without a doubt so

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,800
I want you to be uh I want you to be

70
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,360
comfortable get some herbal tea whatever

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,040
you need sit back and and just you know

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
let me let me throw it all at you so you

73
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,200
can say okay okay and you could sit back

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,040
and everything else let me do the work

75
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,239
here let me do the work and then you sit

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
back relax and uh let's go for the ride

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,879
fasten your seat belts though cuz this

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,800
isn't going to be a pretty this isn't

79
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,959
going to be a pretty show this isn't

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
going to be a pretty one you know the

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,920
funny thing is the symptoms and

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,879
conditions that result from a

83
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,959
compromised liver aren't only the ones

84
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,800
you would expect not the ones you would

85
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,120
expect so you have to always know that

86
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,319
the liver gives us all these different

87
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,120
symptoms that we're not aware of and

88
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,720
conditions that we're not aware of so we

89
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,200
have to think about that for a minute

90
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,040
okay so contrary to popular belief Xmen

91
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,480
sasis isn't a a like autoimmune

92
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,560
condition where the body's attacking

93
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,480
itself that's not what causes ecos

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,040
psoriasis see that's just one condition

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,680
that is a liver problem see the liver is

96
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,560
why someone has examon psoriasis it's

97
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,480
their liver and it's not their body

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,080
attacking the liver their body is not

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,040
attacking the liver at all but that is

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
one prime example that research and

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
science has no idea about has no idea

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,120
that xasis is literally just a liver

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,560
problem and with Xmen psoriasis it's

104
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,640
copper in the liver coupled with a viral

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,159
um a viral load so a lowgrade chronic

106
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,360
viral infection that sits in the liver

107
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,159
for for could be for decades starting

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
from childhood sitting in the liver and

109
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,959
what it does it feeds off a copper

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,200
releases a

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,879
dermatoxin um that dermatoxin floats to

112
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,599
the surface of the skin creates XML or

113
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,799
psoriasis or rosacea and so forth so

114
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,479
that's that one but see you know science

115
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,400
of research isn't there yet so example

116
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,280
so here's the deal like an overloaded

117
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,600
liver can cause acne too nobody knows

118
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,120
that part science and research is still

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,960
kind of hung up on the whole hormone

120
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,360
thing like it must be hormonal something

121
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,039
must be going on but that's not it at

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
all sure you can get acne breakouts

123
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,000
during hormonal period times in your

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,800
life whether it's puberty or menstration

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,520
or anything like that

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,080
because because the immune system drops

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
during anything anything happening

128
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,520
hormonally including a bad experience

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,960
including high stress where your

130
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,440
adrenals are pumping and all those

131
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
hormones are flooding through your body

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,400
from your adrenal glands you can then

133
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,520
get acne a week later nobody knows you

134
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,240
can't connect the dots that happens all

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
the time so it's all about the IM immune

136
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,440
system from dropping because of

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,160
experiences that are hormonal that lower

138
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,639
the immune system research and science

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,759
doesn't know that part so but a sluggish

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,080
liver leads to acne so that's a whole

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,680
another thing you know and and and just

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,600
I could go on and on and on and I think

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,520
I will and I think I will we're told

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,280
it's only hormonal like I said for skin

145
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,039
related but that's not true it's a sign

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,240
that that that basically there the the

147
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,280
liver is under some type of duress some

148
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,120
type of duress and with with acne when

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
the immune system lowers strep which

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,840
sits inside the liver and sits inside

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
the lymphatic vessels and everywhere

152
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,759
else in the body can kind of rise up and

153
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,400
strep causes what you know causes the

154
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,639
body to build up sebum oil and then you

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,120
got the acne and the whole bit and then

156
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,000
you got the cystic acne which is Strep

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
related that's why when doctors used

158
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,080
antibiotics in the old days and a long

159
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
time ago for the first acne cases they

160
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,039
were just like whoa It's Working For A

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
Minute exactly and then it created new

162
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,759
antibiotics and new antibiotics and the

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
strep gets resistant new antibiotics and

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,800
hey you know keep people on antibiotics

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,000
for years try to keep their strep down

166
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,680
they don't know it's strep they don't

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,280
know what's happening that's what I was

168
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,160
saying this is Advanced information so

169
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,759
you can be like armed so you can be

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
protected so you can have armor so you

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,080
can have your Shield so you can be an

172
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,199
expert there's nothing better than being

173
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,479
an expert there's nothing better than

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
being an expert and that's what you are

175
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,319
when you get all this information and

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,960
that's it you can kind of you can hold

177
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,800
that sword hold that Shield in the whole

178
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,840
bit it's important to to protect

179
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,759
yourself when it comes down to health

180
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,639
being an expert in health is really

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,440
important so so we're talking about this

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,280
mystery high blood pressure mystery high

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,599
blood pressure how about that one okay

184
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,400
mystery high blood pressure means they

185
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,880
they don't really see a big old clog

186
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,840
somewhere they don't see a big old clog

187
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,599
like in the artery like tons of plaque

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,120
buildup and and you know and even people

189
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,199
with plaque buildup and all that they

190
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,520
don't have have to have high blood

191
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,440
pressure at all and they don't see a

192
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,360
heart problem a direct heart problem so

193
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
they're thinking like you know hey wait

194
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,280
well you got high blood pressure it's

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
just probably genetic or it's just you

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,479
know maybe your father had it maybe

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,319
whatever and this is what happens or

198
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,039
your you know your mom had it or

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,160
whatever it is and so they go by things

200
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,199
like that but unless they see a direct

201
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,680
like clog somewhere you know that's some

202
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,680
arteries that are really being clogged

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
up and the passageways are getting more

204
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,160
narrow for blood flow and then the blood

205
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,680
pressure can go up because of that but

206
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,160
even with that it doesn't mean blood

207
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,960
pressure is up with a lot of people that

208
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,199
have artery and plaques and plaque

209
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,919
inside their their you know inside the

210
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,759
arteries arterial plaque so what happens

211
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,840
is that it's the liver that has

212
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,720
everything to do with high blood

213
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,479
pressure sluggish liver sluggish

214
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,800
stagnant liver mystery heart

215
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,720
palpitations once again sluggish

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,199
stagnant liver but in that case that

217
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,039
case it has a lot to do with something

218
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,800
viral inside the liver creating a

219
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,560
jelly-like substance that's the Epstein

220
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,440
bar virus that jelly-like substance gets

221
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,479
sucked out of the liver pushed up the

222
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,159
highway right up to the heart collects

223
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,599
in the valves creates heart palpitations

224
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,319
rhythmia ectopic heartbeat and so forth

225
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,039
so science of research doesn't know any

226
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,800
of that either and at all including the

227
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,560
high blood pressure thing I just said

228
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,960
you medical communities are unaware of

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,000
any of this so you're getting really

230
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,759
Advanced information out of Liver Rescue

231
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,560
right here if you don't have a copy of

232
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,759
Liver Rescue you should get a copy of a

233
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,320
rescue if you can't afford a copy go to

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,880
the library I see it all the time I know

235
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,120
I sound like a broken record but that's

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,440
how bad I want you to have the book I

237
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,800
want you to be able to help yourself so

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
we have um and in a book if you don't

239
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,880
have I don't know what it is if you can

240
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,760

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,720
do or at the library so the har

243
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,320
reputations Diabetes Type 2 diabetes see

244
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,880
what happens is science and research

245
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,360
thinks type two diabetes has everything

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,079
to do with nothing but sugar consumption

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,839
and you know insulin resistance from

248
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,120
sugar consumption they're thinking you

249
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,200
know pancreas gets weak A1C goes up got

250
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,440
type 2

251
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,200
diabetes um everything's wrong again

252
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,200
wrong wrong wrong what happens is it has

253
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,440
everything to do with the liver you

254
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
change your diet the liver gets better

255
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,279
okay you start eating better the liver

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
starts getting better your numbers go

257
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,399
down that's how it works if you keep on

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,880
eating all this bad food all this bad

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,079
food that's filled with fat and sugar

260
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,640
combined toiv gets burdened the liver

261
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:33,120
gets burdened the liver gets burdened

262
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,839
gets sluggish sluggish sluggish type two

263
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,279
diabetes is a sluggish liver you get

264
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,120
your liver a little bit better you you

265
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,399
lose the type two diabetes or the or the

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,600
the blood sugar issues that's sluggish

267
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,959
liver right there so think about that

268
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
and I mean I'm I'm going through all

269
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,519
these different conditions right here

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,680
which is kind of cool you know I didn't

271
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
expect that on the show I didn't expect

272
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,040
it I was going to go about I was going

273
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,560
to talk about other things about the

274
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,640
liver being sluggish how it works and

275
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,959
everything but it's I guess it's good to

276
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,839
actually connect the dots right here of

277
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,240
the conditions that sluggish liver

278
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,839
brings I think that that's the best way

279
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,240
to do it I mean I just realized it just

280
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,200
now I was just going to give you this

281
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,480
whole bunch of stuff about sluggish

282
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,519
liver which we're going to do which

283
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,440
we're still going to do but this is

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,240
really cool um I'm excited about this so

285
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,360
in Liver Rescue I talk all about this I

286
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,720
have whole section in the book on

287
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,079
sluggish liver it's important to know

288
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,839
all this stuff and I can't scratch the

289
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,440
surface of what Liver Rescue has in this

290
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,760
radio show I I know some some of you are

291
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,959
probably listen to radio show well I

292
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,519
don't need to get the book I got his

293
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,320
radio shows actually actually the book

294
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,760
is massive and the the word count is

295
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,920
huge and I can't even scratch a surface

296
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,240
it's not even possible but this is fun

297
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,639
so we got um we got the type 2 diabetes

298
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,399
so what happens with diabetes is and

299
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,399
I'll give you the quick rendition of it

300
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,800
because we'll probably do another

301
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,839
diabetes show down the road the quick

302
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,720
rendition is with type 2 diabetes is the

303
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,920
liver gets sluggish toxic and it's from

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,680
the high fat diet all high fat diet it

305
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,320
just so happens people usually eat a lot

306
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
of bad sugar with their High fats so

307
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,160
what does that mean bad sugar where your

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
hide fats it's ice cream it's fat sugar

309
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,839
that's just an example right there you

310
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,800
know milk lactose fat that's milk I mean

311
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,040
it's you know cheese fat sugar that's

312
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,880
that's what that is cheese you have

313
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,680
cheese to just you have fat and sugar

314
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,959
what that does is it creates a real

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,800
sluggish liver creates a real sluggish

316
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,079
liver it puts lots of fat in the

317
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,120
bloodstream puts poor quality sugars in

318
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,600
the bloodstream at the same

319
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,720
time and but but really you can do that

320
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,839
you can put you can put ice cream into

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
people and young people and they're not

322
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,560
getting type 2 diabetes they're not

323
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,839
getting insulin resistance because their

324
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,240
liver isn't sluggish yet you see how it

325
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,560
goes your liver starts getting sluggish

326
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,120
from all the junk in it from all the

327
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
garbage in it from high fat diet for

328
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,519
many years

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
you know a teenager is not on a high fat

330
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200
diet for many years but when you start

331
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
getting in your 20s and you're getting

332
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,760
in your 30s you're still doing high fat

333
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
diets and now we're told to eat high fat

334
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,079
diets high protein high fat diets now

335
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,279
but minus the sugar as if that's the

336
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
answer if that's actually the answer

337
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,760
which it's not it's not in Liver Rescue

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,320
I explain the whole thing it's not the

339
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
answer I have a whole section of the

340
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,160
book talking about the high fat Trend

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
and where it came from how it started

342
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,040
and why it's not right and what's right

343
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,560
and what isn't what's wrong what's not

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,800
whatever just so you got the right

345
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
information

346
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,600
just so you don't waste time I mean I

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,320
don't know life is precious and when I

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,160
think about it when I think about how

349
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,079
precious life is and um every day is

350
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,880
precious every hour is precious I mean

351
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,880
come on face it I mean right and when I

352
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:50,240
think about wasting time on information

353
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,720
that that is isn't correct or doesn't

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,399
get you anywhere or you think it is but

355
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
in the end it tricks you and it's like

356
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,320
falls through your hand like sand and

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,040
then it doesn't get you anywhere down

358
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,959
the road it's really disappointing

359
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,279
because how much time was invested how

360
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:07,079
much money is invested whatever it is

361
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,560
it's really sad and and life here on

362
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,240
Earth is precious we need every minute

363
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,040
we can get so getting the real

364
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,600

382
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,000
every podcast they almost can't even

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,959

your time and that's the key right here

392
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,440
so what happens is when somebody's

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,880
younger and they're and they're not

394
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,199
getting that kind of they're sluggish

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,480
they're not getting that sluggish liver

396
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,240
yet and let me tell you something young

397
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
people get sluggish liver too and

398
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,959
they're not getting that sluggish so

399
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
many are are younger they're not getting

400
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,240
the sluggish liver quite yet what

401
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,160
happens right there is they're not going

402
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,600
to show signs of A1C Rising they're not

403
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,680
going to show signs of diabetes 2

404
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,880
they're not going to show signs of any

405
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,880
of that they might see you might see

406
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,160
some hypoglycemia I've seen a lot of

407
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,399
teenagers with hypoglycemia without a

408
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,040
doubt without a doubt not hyper so much

409
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,800
but always hypo so that's a sluggish

410
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,600
liver starting right there all on its

411
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,279
own but the point is it's not you know

412
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,040
not not not the most normal thing it's

413
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,199
just yeah there there are teenagers

414
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,759
going through that and then people in

415
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,240
their 20s go through it more people in

416
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,600
the 30s go through it even more sluggish

417
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,279
liver gets worse and worse and worse you

418
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,079
got the fat and the sugar combinations

419
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,639
you fat and sugar combinations fin liver

420
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
is just like oh my God I can't take this

421
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,560
anymore I can't handle this anymore the

422
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,399
liver can think I can think it can

423
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,320
function it has over 2,000 chemical

424
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,320
functions undiscovered by research and

425
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,040
Science and in those 2,000 chemical

426
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,120
functions it it it's it's at a place

427
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,000
it's at a place where it you know it has

428
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,320
to think for you it actually has to

429
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,959
think for you if it doesn't think for

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,120
you it can't protect you it can't do the

431
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,079
best it can to give you that longer life

432
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,399
and we just trash our livers and that's

433
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,800
the whole thing

434
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,920
we do trash or livers I mean it's it's

435
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,480
that's how it works here do we do it on

436
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,040
purpose I I don't know if anybody really

437
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,000
does it on purpose even if someone

438
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,440
drinks I don't know if they're trashing

439
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,040
the liver on purpose even if someone

440
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,040
drinks so it's just a really really

441
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,279
strange situation on that whole thing

442
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
but so but basically we do trash your

443
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,000
livers maybe it's by default maybe it's

444
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,160
by just being here but either way so

445
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that sluggish sluggish liver what

446
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,920
happens is it starts to get so clogged

447
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,279
up with

448
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,759
fat and it loses its glucose

449
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,759
reserves on top of that that's that's

450
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,360
what happens then the pancreas starts to

451
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,040
give away a little bit starts to give

452
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,759
away a little bit weaken a little bit

453
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,480
too it's really the sluggish liver that

454
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,920
gets you into the diabetes the type 2

455
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
diabetes but what happens is someone

456
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,279
starts exercising and they start shaking

457
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,720
up their liver and they start changing

458
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,000
their diet and they start taking out the

459
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,600
sugar and they still keep their high fat

460
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,639
diet but they take out the sugar their

461
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,720
A1C goes down and the doctor's like look

462
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,079
you're already getting better but

463
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,680
doesn't mean your liver's not sluggish

464
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,120
as heck and diabetes can't come back in

465
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,199
the drop of a hat when you eat a little

466
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,440
sugar what you really need to do is drop

467
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,839
the fat and bring healthy carbohydrates

468
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
in healthy sugars and that's how you

469
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,560
beat it and that's how you get rid of

470
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
your sluggish liver but that's just

471
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,560
diabetes that's was just a quick a quick

472
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,319
rendition of that real quick you know

473
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,720
it's it's actually a joke it's like it's

486
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,400

they're walking a little bit more

492
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
they're eating a little bit better maybe

493
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,400
they ate a couple of pieces of fresh

494
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,360
fruit maybe they had some

495
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,360

496
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,000

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
they get a little more sun but they're

500
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,880
helping their liver and then what about

501
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,720
all those people that don't have

502
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
Seasonal effective disorder their liver

503
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,280
is not as bad yet so they kind of tend

504
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,280
to do okay in the winter

505
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
but everybody you know everybody in the

506
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,039
winter months you know does doesn't do

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
that great unless they're you know

508
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,760
exercising and they're in the gyms and

509
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,880
everything else and they're taking care

510
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,200
of the liver a little bit and they're

511
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,039
eating still a little bit better and

512
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,840
then they can kind of but seasonal

513
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,440
effectives order like it was a big

514
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,080
Discovery unbelievable I think it's a

515
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
group of I don't know a group of doctors

516
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,159
or group of experts have their name on

517
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,159
seasonal effectiv disorder from back in

518
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,039
the 80s it's like oh my God yawn my God

519
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,200
because it's it's like when you think

520
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,919
about it you can't even scratch the

521
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,320
surface to what it really is or even get

522
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,919
to it not to men you get all the people

523
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,799
with chronic illness meaning a chronic

524
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,039
fatigue syndrome where it gets worse in

525
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
the winter or it even gets worse in the

526
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,720
summer because their nerves are inflamed

527
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,919
and that's the whole thing seasonal

528
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,200
effect disorder went to Summertime

529
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,559
because it was getting so kind of like

530
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,760
shady where it wasn't the winter there

531
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,440
all these people they're exhibiting

532
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,600
symptoms and it's summertime too and

533
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,679
they're exhibiting symptoms in the

534
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,280
spring and exhibiting symptoms in the

535
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,480
fall it's kind of was ridiculous what

536
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,240
was happening because do people have

537
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,919
viruses in their liver they got chronic

538
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,240
illness they got Epstein bar inside

539
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,679
their liver they got chronic fatigue

540
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,039
syndrome on and off they got all kinds

541
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,720
of different things going on and it all

542
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,360
reflects on you know how their nerves

543
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,880
feel and if they can't handle the heat

544
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
they swell up with the humidity and in

545
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,440
the winter time they hurt and they're

546
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,559
sore and they're achy and is it sad no

547
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
it's so many other

548
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,159
things and that's the joke about

549
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
Seasonal effective disorder but if you

550
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,200
take seasonal effect disorder you know

551
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,799
serious for what it you know for the

552
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,960
name or whatever it is you look at it's

553
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,600
a liver problem and it's all these other

554
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
problems with the liver it's all these

555
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,400
other problems with the liver so can set

556
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,679
you up dark circles under the eyes

557
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,919
that's a sluggish liver because the

558
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,080
blood's getting filled with so many

559
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,720
toxins so the blood's getting filled

560
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,360
with so many toxins unless you haven't

561
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,760
slept unless you don't

562
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,799
sleep I'll get a few dark circles under

563
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,400
my I'll get a few days of it without a

564
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,039
doubt because I'm working on the books

565
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
and I don't want to stop sometimes you

566
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,159
get on a roll and you just you just

567
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,600
don't want to stop and spirit's giving

568
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,200
you the information you don't want to

569
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,720
stop you just don't want to say oh no I

570
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,760
I I can't do this right now you just

571
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
want to just take that medical

572
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,039
information from Spirit you want to put

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,640
it in you want to put it in you want to

574
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,640
write it write it write and so if that

575
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,600
means three days of being up mostly and

576
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,679
sleeping on and off on the

577
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,120
couch for a few hours or whatever it is

578
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,640
yeah I'll get some dark circles but if

579
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,679
you have dark circles and you're getting

580
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,720
all the

581
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,120
sleep you're getting all the sleep I

582
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,799
mean you're getting 8 hours a night 7

583
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,880
hours a night whatever 6 hours a night

584
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,120
you're getting your sleep you got some

585
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,240
dark circles that's the sluggish liver

586
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,039
and those are toxins in the blood blood

587
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,280
toxins floating around floating around

588
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,760
those blood toxins are floating around

589
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,120
and they surface to this thin skin the

590
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,360
under your eyes you got your thinnest

591
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,080
skin that's your thinnest skin under

592
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,039
your eyes I don't I mean the under your

593
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,159
armpits and under your eyes it's your

thinnest skin especially under the eyes

595
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,960
and so you'll see you know you see the

596
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,600
dark circles because that's actually

597
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,679
blood that's toxic

598
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,120

599
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,000

could be sitting in there not doing much

768
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,159
but it bogs the liver down and weight

769
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,240
gain occurs get the hot flashes you get

come bloating can come so it's just you

774
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,559
know sluggish liver can lead to anything

775
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,000
and what happens is what happens when

776
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,840
the liver gets sluggish talk about that

777
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,480
a little bit long longer before I go

778
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,440
into more symptoms and conditions when

779
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:07,080
the liver gets sluggish bio

780
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:10,399
reserves break down they break down bio

781
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,360
production weakens so bio production

782
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,919
weakens why is bio so important you guys

783
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,880
because it goes up into your gut goes up

784
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,919
drops into your intestinal tract drops

785
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,720
into your dadum drops down in there and

786
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,840
it's there to disperse fats so it's

787
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,640
there to disp disperse fats and if it

788
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,880
doesn't disperse fats and we keep on

789
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,279
bombarding our we keep on bombarding

790
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,399
ourselves with these high fat diets

791
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,799
including the healthy ones right now all

792
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,519
that bile got to be produced wearing

793
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,240
down the liver let's wear out the liver

794
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:48,159
let's wear it wear it down so it's got

795
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,279
to produce all its bio reserves and wear

796
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,080
it down and break it down no one even

797
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,519
talks about this stuff they don't even

798
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,399
know not even the experts out there

799
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,279
so-called experts you know I talked to

800
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,880
some of those experts out there also

801
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,399
writing books or whatever in health and

802
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,960
everything and it's almost like I I

803
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,320
can't talk to them because they they

804
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,320
they they think you're talking Chinese

805
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,399
when you talk about because they've

806
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,360
never heard this information before they

807
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,440
don't understand it they don't know that

808
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,519
sluggish liver means bio reserves break

809
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,799
down then then fats can't disperse from

810
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,240
the high fat healthy diet and then the

811
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,960
fats have to go somewhere and you know

812
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,600
where it goes It goes on the lining of

813
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,080
your intestinal tract grows ran it and

814
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,519
feeds bacteria and they look at you they

815
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,480
don't know they don't understand it's

816
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,559
crazy they'll just say um well you know

817
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,559
it's it's good to get rid of sugar and

818
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,120
carbohydrates and um and healthy fats

819
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,559
are good for you and they're good for

820
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,440
your brain I that's where it stops it's

821
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,640
actually unbelievable and then they say

822
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,200
oh and stay away from grains you got to

823
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,640
stay away from grains this is where it

824
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,720
stops and I'm like oh my God am I am I

825
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,120
talking to who am I talking to and

826
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,080
they're just like well you need your

827
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,279
protein and you got to get rid of your

828
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,240
car carbohydrates and you got to get rid

829
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,640
of your grains Okay okay you get to rid

830
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,519
of gluten you got to worry about your

831
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,679
lectins oh okay sure sure and you got to

832
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,440
get rid of this and then you know and

833
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,880
and this way you know you're you don't

834
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,960
get the insulin resistance you get rid

835
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,720
of your sugars out of your diet got to

836
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,080
exercise it's almost like oh my God I

837
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,000
just got stupider I just got stupider

838
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,480
it's unbelievable to me

839
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,519
really and you know and so the bottom

840
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,840
line is what happens is if your bile

841
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,960
breaks down because of the high fat diet

842
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,399
you've been on for so many years meaning

843
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,240
the poor fats you've been eating then

844
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,960
the good fats whatever all the same to

845
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,519
deliver eventually in the end you got to

846
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,279
just lower them you don't just you can

847
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,440
have fats and I'm not saying some fats

848
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,600
aren't good for you that's not it but

849
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,320
the liver it gets so beaten down so

850
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,360
burdened down so then the bile can't

851
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,880
actually break down any fats anymore

852
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
what this happens is with your sluggish

853
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,799
liver it also causes your stomach to

854
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,240
lose its hydrochloric acid so that

855
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,039
breaks down down so you can't break down

856
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,240
your proteins good anymore and then you

857
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:04,600
get gut rot and then you get diagnosed

858
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,600
with sibo strep with strepa cacus that

859
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,919
doctors don't even know either and I was

860
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,240
talking to another expert and I was like

861
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,000
well what what what kind of bacteria do

862
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,240
you think's in there and they're like um

863
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,039
it's just bacteria you know it's an

864
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,320
overgrowth of bacteria I go what kind of

865
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,919
bacteria I'm like well we don't know

866
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,679
nobody knows what bacteria it is I go

867
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,360
yeah of course it's strep that's what it

868
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,200
is people are loaded with it from their

869
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,720
mouth down to their butt and they loaded

870
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,639
with it it's in their throat deep in

871
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,639
their tonsils just sitting there it's

872
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,039
coming out in acne

873
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,080
everywhere yeah it's just chronic

875
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,799

for you it's bad for the liver oh my God

944
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,600
dear Lord I'm going to tell you now that

945
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,240
that's what it's like out there it's

946
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,360
that's exactly what it's like out there

947
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,359
I am not exaggerating here and I'm not

948
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,879
just I'm not yeah I'm not just saying

949
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,200
this the whole bit so when it comes down

950
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,679
to weight gain you got the sluggish

951
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,040
liver the bio reserves break down so

952
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,359
then your fats that are in your gut

953
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,839
they're going in there that's why the

954
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,320
weight is coming on so fast for so many

955
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,760
people the bile can't break it down

956
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,280
disperse it into the bloodstream and

957
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,919
even if it does break it down disperse

958
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,440
it into the bloodstream you still got

959
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,639
all this fat in the bloodstream causing

960
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,159
problems and going back up into the

961
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,359
liver again that's a whole another

962
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,839
problem but that's why you got to lower

963
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:41,679
the fats in the diet for the for the

964
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,040
sluggish liver but weight gain has a lot

965
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,560
to do with that sure people lose weight

966
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,320
when they go on like they when they go

967
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,800
on they go off of all sugar they go on a

968
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,560
radical change of their diet their body

969
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,679
goes into shock they start exercising an

970
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,200
hour a day and they start losing weight

971
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,359
they're just eating you know some some

972
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,839
protein and which is fat some protein

973
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,200
and fat and some vegetables and they've

974
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,359
changed everything they stopped eating

975
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,839
the pizza their body goes in the shock

976
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,040
but their liver still stays sluggish

977
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,320
they still have a high-fat diet and

978
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,880
they're still prone to heart attacks all

979
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,119
the time I've seen people in the best

980
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,200
shape with sluggish livers get heart

981
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,680
attacks just heart attacks I I see it so

982
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,839
I mean it's so unbelievable out there 39

983
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,640
years old heart attacks 38 years old 42

984
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,000
44 whatever even exercising taking care

985
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,599
of themselves I'm not talking about

986
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,040
people that aren't taking care of

987
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:32,160
themselves at all because what it is is

988
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,079
you got this liver completely stagnant

989
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,720
and sluggish no one's doing anything

990
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,680
about the liver they're still on a diet

991
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,560
that's not that's not helping the liver

992
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
it's hurting the liver they've gotten

993
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,960
weight off they've shifted things

994
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,760
they're exercising but it's not enough

995
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
we have to do more we have to do more if

996
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,920
everybody thinks if anybody thinks

997
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,440
they're just you know

998
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,160
protected I mean you know no no you have

999
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,200
to do things for yourself and the live a

1000
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,520
rescue that's what I talk about here so

1001
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,440
so with the weight gain all that F it's

1002
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,200
rants it sits on the Linings it's built

1003
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,760
up on the Linings of the intestinal

1004
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,440
tract the walls everywhere it gets

1005
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,760
rancid starts getting hard gets in the

1006
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,440
bloodstream too much it gets in the

1007
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,319
liver starts getting hard it gets in the

1008
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,359
liver sits there gets stagnant sluggish

1009
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,560
liver gets like that hydrochloric acid

1010
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,000
starts to break down in the stomach

1011
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,480
because the liver is breaking down the

1012
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,319
liver is weakening so HCL has to

1013
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,480
overproduce until it burns out so your

1014
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:29,319
gastric acid built Burns Out you start

1015
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,839
bloating you get weight gained and

1016
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:32,520
you're bloating the whole thing can go

1017
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,200
wrong and this is just I'm just

1018
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,319
scratching A A Touch of this I mean I

1019
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,880
could do a we're going to do a whole

1020
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,240
show on all this stuff chemical

1021
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,560
sensitivities chemical

1022
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,680
sensitivities that's one right there

1023
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,480
that's a sluggish liver a liver filled

1024
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,200
with a lot of poisons and toxins in the

1025
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,119
body reacting as these toxins are

1026
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,240
actually leaving the liver not only that

1027
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,440
they're in the liver stored and then you

1028
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,839
can't do any it can't store anymore more

1029
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,800
so then the chemicals anything anything

1030
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,200
you're exposed to you name it sits

1031
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,400
around in your system longer and longer

1032
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,839
and longer it can't even be vacuumed up

1033
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,160
into the

1034
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,880
liver I mean once again that's a real

1035
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,440
stagnant sluggish sluggish liver and

1036
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
I've seen people with a lot of weight on

1037
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
them with chemical sensitivities a lot

1038
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,640
of weight on them with the worst

1039
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,359
chemical sensitivities just really

1040
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,880
sluggish lymphatic system the liver

1041
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:25,599
sluggish a lot of weight on them the

1042
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,319
whole bit and I've seen people skinny as

1043
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,880
rails so skinny with chemical

1044
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,640
sensitivities and you still can have a

1045
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,599
dysfunctional fatty sluggish liver

1046
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,160
that's how how it works too you can have

1047
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,200
both things with different people

1048
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,280
easily easily with different people and

1049
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,440
for different reasons but that's how it

1050
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,200
works and then I've seen people they're

1051
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,920
really skinny but then they gain all the

1052
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,319
weight later so they chemical

1053
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,119
sensitivity is really skinny and they

1054
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,079
gain all this weight later after their

1055
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,079
adrenals start to really burn out but

1056
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,839
the adrenaline is actually keeping

1057
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,839
keeping their weight off I've seen

1058
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,280
people go 10 15 years really thin really

1059
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,720
thin not eating good not eating great

1060
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,280
really thin no carbohydrates I mean the

1061
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
healthy carbohydrates all on fat and

1062
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,720
protein thin in a bad way meaning like

1063
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
where where everybody's

1064
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,200
worried and then and then what happens

1065
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,960
is eventually catches up the adrenaline

1066
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,520
stops the whole thing what happens it's

1067
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,800
what when you're on the fat high fat

1068
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,920
diets when you're on the high fat diets

1069
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,119
whether we're talking about chemical

1070
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,599
sensitivities for a second but let's

1071
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,280
just go up when you're on these high fat

1072
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,640
diets it it it it burns the adrenals out

1073
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,280
because when you put fat when you eat

1074
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,240
too much fat over fat of any kind your

1075
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,359
adrenals have to flood the body with

1076
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,440
adrenaline to keep the blood as thin as

1077
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,319
possible it just wears the adrenals out

1078
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,200
too breaks it down totally kills them

1079
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,760
that's another example and I was

1080
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,839
explaining that to one guy and I was

1081
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,319
like look I said you have to understand

1082
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,839
the more fat you're putting in every day

1083
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,960
the more your adrenals have to keep on

1084
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,280
flooding and and you'll get a little

1085
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,560
high off of it but your adrenals are

1086
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,359
just going to be going and going and

1087
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,960
going how long can that last before all

1088
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:13,359
this weight comes back on before all

1089
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,079
this weight comes back on cuz that's

1090
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,280
what

1091
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,880
happens I was talking to a couple of you

1092
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,800
know trendy experts that got like books

1093
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,240
out and stuff and they're like yeah but

1094
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,480
and and I realized they they haven't

1095
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,560
been really doing it that long they

1096
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,520
might be doctors but they were doctors

1097
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,520
different field of medicine and they

1098
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,880
were doing conventional medicine and

1099
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,520
they decided to go alternative you know

1100
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,560
in The Last 5 Years so they don't even

1101
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,800
have a track record of seeing people

1102
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,160
sick for 20 30 years and heal for 2030

1103
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,319
years and going through all the

1104
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,599
different things and that's another

1105
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,920
thing I'm seeing now but they put out

1106
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,119
all this data and everybody bites it's

1107
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,160
amazing it's amazing and I'm saying this

1108
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,520
because you got to protect yourself and

1109
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,560
not be afraid of fruit you got to

1110
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,880
protect yourself and lower your fats I

1111
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,119
can teach you how to do it we'll do it

1112
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,319
in every show we it's it's doable you

1113
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:05,040
can do it so chemical sensitivities

1114
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,280
that's the blood being toxic with a lot

1115
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,720
of different poisons but also it means

1116
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,800
you're viral so with chemical

1117
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,400
sensitivities you have to be viral there

1118
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,880
has to be a virus inside the liver

1119
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,240
feeding off of all kinds of different

1120
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,839
poisons and releasing different

1121
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,200
varieties of toxins not just dermat

1122
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:22,599
toxins and and and uh neurotoxins that

1123
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,400
these viruses are

1124
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,720
releasing including bacteria but

1125
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,720
releasing other forms of toxins the body

1126
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,800
gets allergic to and sensitive to so

1127
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,520
this way you become hyper sensitive to

1128
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,480
whatever exposure out there because you

1129
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,520
have exposure internally that's all

1130
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,200
sluggish liver begin with it's viral

1131
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,359
sluggish liver but it's sluggish liver

1132
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,720
but it's viral sluggish

1133
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:50,800
liver I mean we can go we can go on here

1134
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,040
and on bloating low hydrochloric acid

1135
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,720
because of a sluggish liver low gastric

1136
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,440
acid because of a sluggish liver low bio

1137
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,680
reserves it just just talked about that

1138
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,800
that's bloating that means the liver got

1139
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,319
sluggish a long time ago and you can do

1140
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,280
something about it we can fix all this

1141
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,920
we can fix all of this so you know if

1142
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
anybody's just you know cluing on to the

1143
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,800
show or just got on to the show I'm

1144
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,680
talking about Liver Rescue I'm talking

1145
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,040
about rescuing our liver sluggish liver

1146
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,599
is what I'm talking about it's very

1147
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,280
important constipation once again

1148
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,040
sluggish liver filled the bacteria

1149
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,839
though constipation has a lot to do with

1150
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,800
bacteria sometimes viruses inside the

1151
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,680
liver

1152
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,240
a lot of toxins and poisons is another

1153
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,440
thing

1154
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,359
so it's amazing and I got to tell you

1155
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,160
something it's completely unknown that

1156
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,440
these and more originate at the liver so

1157
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,200
it's completely unknown that these

1158
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,480
symptoms and conditions and more a lot

1159
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,760
more that I even that I talk about in

1160
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,480
this book too are related to the

1161
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,640
liver and that's how it

1162
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,200
works that's how it works it's just

1163
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,920
incredible how it works so it's not just

1164
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,680
sluggish liver I say or anything like

1165
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,760
that I say stagnant liver that's what I

1166
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,520
say and you can say that too that's fine

1167
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,960
um but but there's so much to learn

1168
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,440
about this so let's talk a little bit

1169
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,200
more too about all of

1170
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,240
this you know it it's it's when you take

1171
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,839
when you take a walk every single day

1172
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,319
what are you doing you're saying well

1173
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,240
I'm glad I'm walking I'm glad I'm taking

1174
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:24,040
a walk when you take a walk every day

1175
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,119
I'm glad I'm you know people I talk to

1176
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,359
people and they're like well I took a

1177
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,359
walk today was good and I was doing this

1178
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,040
I was doing that I was really

1179
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,720
active and and it's incredible because

1180
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,280
someone's thinking about I was eating

1181
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,000
really good today I've said people tell

1182
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,200
me hey aw I'm eating really good today

1183
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,640
I'm actually I'm actually you should see

1184
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,359
it you should see what I'm doing and

1185
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,480
it's

1186
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,280
incredible and everything we do for

1187
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,040
ourselves we have to think about what am

1188
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,760
I doing for my liver is this helping my

1189
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,760
liver and and eating better can help

1190
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,160
your liver everything I'm doing can help

1191
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,559
the

1192
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,160
liver and so that's important I want to

1193
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,400
talk about bugs inside the liver for a

1194
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,440
couple of minutes

1195
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,200
too I really do and we'll go into this

1196
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,480
so there's all these unwanted bugs and

1197
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,240
poisons in our liver that are actually

1198
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,760
that are our liver is dealing with and

1199
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,119
our liver has its own immune system to

1200
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,640
help kill off these bugs so we want to

1201
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,280
support the liver's immune system so

1202
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,839
helping sluggish liver by supporting the

1203
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,119
liver's immune system is another way of

1204
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:23,559
getting it out of sluggishness because

1205
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:25,280
you're killing off the bugs that are

1206
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,640
inside of the liver and that's really

1207
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,599
important

1208
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,000
and the thing is it takes a lot of

1209
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,559
nutrients inside the liver in order to

1210
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,160
battle anything so that's why foods are

1211
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,119
so important in taking care of ourselves

1212
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,119
that's why we need to lower all the fats

1213
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,559
and we got to get all these other

1214
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:47,040
nutrients in there it's incredible the

1215
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:50,520
last thing a liver needs is fat the last

1216
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,280
thing if you ever hear that glucose

1217
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,480
sugar of any kind healthy sugar I mean

1218
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:02,240
hurts the liver is bad for the liver you

1219
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,800
have just heard the most negligent and

1220
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,400
disappointing

1221
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,000
and unbelievable pieces of

1222
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,920
misinformation there is in the

1223
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,760
industries if you hear that out there

1224
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,319
see that on the internet you just heard

1225
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,400
the worst of it because because what

1226
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,079
what happens out there is when you hear

1227
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,400
that then you don't know what to do the

1228
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,880
fat doesn't the fat isn't good for the

1229
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,839
liver doesn't want any fat going into it

1230
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,160
it doesn't want to deal with any fats so

1231
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,119
you have to remember that so when it's

1232
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,040
overburdened with having to deal with

1233
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,280
fat because it's overburden with Epstein

1234
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,319
bar bacteria heavy metals old DDT

1235
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,960
aluminum exposure it's pesticides and

1236
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,200
all the different cousins of pesticides

1237
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,920
insecticides everything like that you

1238
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,280
know I remember I

1239
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,720
remember when I got an apartment it was

1240
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,960
laced it was laced with insecticide when

1241
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,880
I got an

1242
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,800
apartment it was laced you can smell it

1243
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,559
I you to talk to a landlord landlord's

1244
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,760
like well yeah we did you know we we we

1245
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,440
do and we do an insect spray you know

1246
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,720
they come in here and they got the

1247
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,880
little you know they get the little

1248
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,160
machine and they're just got a little

1249
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,480
backpack and they're just spraying every

1250
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,720
corner of every wall and you know we're

1251
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,400
they they're spraying for this and

1252
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,400
spraying for that and it's just it's

1253
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,920
unbelievable where did all that go when

1254
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,760
I was standing there inhaling all that

1255
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,800
or living in it where did it all go when

1256
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,520
inside the

1257
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,119
liver it it just does even carpet

1258
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,280
cleaning chemicals just goes inside the

1259
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,000
liver everything goes in there so you

1260
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,960
got all these different

1261
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,960
things our livers are meant to purify

1262
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:47,520
and filter and hold on to the

1263
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,640
good so hold on to the good stuff so

1264
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,680
it's it they our livers become hoarders

1265
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,960
they hold on to the good things but they

1266
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,319
also have to hold on to the bad things

1267
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,520
the more bad things we get in the liver

1268
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:04,800
the less ability it can hold on to the

1269
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,960
good things and that's how it

1270
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,920
goes so we have to always remember that

1271
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,920
the more bad things the liver fills up

1272
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,240
creates a sluggish liver the more it can

1273
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,200
hold on to the good things the liver is

1274
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,520
filled with vitamins and nutrients going

1275
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,160
all the way back all the way back since

1276
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,640
the beginning including inherited

1277
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,240
meaning inherited meaning like literally

1278
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,040
from the family l nutrients from Mom and

1279
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,119
and and and her mom there are some

1280
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:37,119
nutrients that get passed along to our

1281
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,559
lier it has to have nutrients it holds

1282
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,640
on to a whole whole bunch of nutrients

1283
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:46,359
like unbelievable how many and then it's

1284
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,280
conversion the conversion ability cuz

1285
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,760
the liver converts everything it plays

1286
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,640
with things it moves things around it

1287
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,720
converts it I mean this is it's

1288
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,160
unbelievable about what the liver does

1289
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,960
and it releases

1290
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,319
nutrients and minerals and hormones all

1291
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,839
into the bloodstream and that's its job

1292
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,359
but yet its other job is to actually

1293
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,640
filter out all those poisons I just

1294
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,599
talked about and all those toxins that

1295
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,000
make it sluggish what happens is when

1296
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,200
those toxins are going up up up up up

1297
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,079
and up and they're climbing and they're

1298
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,800
climbing and climbing all the ability

1299
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,400
for the SL all the ability for that

1300
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,079
liver to actually being sending it to

1301
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,160
send out the right hormones the right

1302
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,640
conversions of nutrients methyl ating

1303
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,440
everything cuz the liver methylates

1304
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,760
virtually

1305
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,480
everything so all of that going on the

1306
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,760
liver can't do that anymore so you can

1307
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,720
get people who are mineral deficient or

1308
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,839
deficient or going to going to doctors

1309
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,240
or whatever it is and they're going to

1310
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:43,480
all these different doctors and they're

1311
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,839
getting all these different blood work

1312
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,520
all the profile and everything it's like

1313
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:47,960
you're deficient in this this this this

1314
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,559
this that's because of a liver problem

1315
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,119
and nobody even knows that and then

1316
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,960
they'll give you the wrong diet that

1317
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,480
will still keep your liver sluggish and

1318
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,880
keep it harmed that's the irony they'll

1319
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,359
take you off of you make sure you're not

1320
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,559
doing any fruit they'll make sure you're

1321
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,559
doing high protein which is high fat and

1322
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,720
they'll whatever including even if

1323
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,760
you're vegan or plant-based this isn't

1324
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,119
about animal protein people you're vegan

1325
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,720
or plant-based there just put lots of

1326
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,760
lots of fats and you could be hardly

1327
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,920
doing any fruit or leafy greens really

1328
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,440
just being doing lots of fats and so

1329
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,119
what happens is you got all these

1330
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,280
deficiencies it's all showing up

1331
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,800
everywhere and that's the liver

1332
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,319
that's how it

1333
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,400
works so I mean it goes goes on and on

1334
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:35,920
and on

1335
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,079
basically basically it's good to know

1336
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,440
that there's warnings that happen here's

1337
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,040
how it works with the liver too the

1338
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,359
liver neutralizes so it

1339
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:49,680
neutralizes it has to neutralize poison

1340
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:52,760
all the time it has to stop

1341
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,200
poisons and neutralize them so that you

1342
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,200
know what happens is when it's

1343
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,599
neutralizing I'll say it over and over

1344
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,880
again it's that important of a word for

1345
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,000
this that's why it's that

1346
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,799
important what that means is it's

1347
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,079
stopping the toxin from being as harmful

1348
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:12,839
as it really is so that when it leaves

1349
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,480
the liver it doesn't hurt you as much

1350
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,440
that's the power of the liver and what

1351
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,520
the liver can do it's it's

1352
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,799
extraordinary and so it's doing that so

1353
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,240
it has over 2,000 chemical functions

1354
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:26,200
that involve detoxification neutralizing

1355
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,000
poisons and everything else and what

1356
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,520
happens when your liver gets sluggish

1357
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,520
from all the different poisons that are

1358
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,200
already in the liver and then you're

1359
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,920
bombarding it with high fat diets and

1360
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,680
everything else what

1361
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,200
happens it loses it neutralizing

1362
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,799
capability that's how you age fast down

1363
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,480
the road sure you might not be looking

1364
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:46,720
like you're aging when you're in your

1365
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,440
20s you might not be looking like you're

1366
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,200
aging when you're in your

1367
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,200
30s but you know you start aging too

1368
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,400
fast when you get or people do you know

1369
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,280
they start aging too fast and that can

1370
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,559
happen that's a neutralizing ability is

1371
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,760
lost because of a sluggish

1372
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:08,640
liver the liver also has an anti-s

1373
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,079
sluggish emergency alarm response it's a

1374
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,480
chemical induced response that brings in

1375
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,720
new vital energy to break up stagnancy

1376
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:23,280
the response is a liver spasm this spasm

1377
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:26,480
can result in A tingle a twitch a slight

1378
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,920
ache a warmth a heat a pulling bloating

1379
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,520
a prickly feeling A Stitch in the

1380
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,000
side that's what this

1381
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,720
is it's incredible but you even lose

1382
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,559
that opportunity when the liver gets too

1383
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,559
sluggish and it starts breaking down you

1384
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:45,680
even lose that opportunity and that's

1385
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,440
the sad sad thing there are five

1386
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,160
varieties of sluggish liver so five

1387
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,480
varieties of sluggish liver I'll give

1388
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,079
you that real

1389
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,040
quick there's the middle of the liver

1390
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,640
that's one variety of sluggish liver so

1391
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,520
the middle of the liver can get

1392
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,440
sluggish science of research has no clue

1393
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,720
that's like 30 40 50 years from

1394
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,359
now maybe I mean that's if we're

1395
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,839
lucky it's not even about the liver

1396
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:14,720
itself as a whole becoming sluggish it's

1397
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,040
different sections of the liver that

1398
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,599
become sluggish and I'm just going to

1399
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,240
give you this rundown really quick see

information I was blown off my seat so

1403

the middle of the liver that's the

1404
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,160
deepest part of the liver and that's

1405
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:37,240
when you can get hot flashes night
