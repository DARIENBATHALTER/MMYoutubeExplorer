[7.88 - 11.80] amazing time and I'm deeply honored
[9.72 - 14.20] you're here hyperthyroidism
[11.80 - 16.48] hypothyroidism
[14.20 - 17.56] Hashimoto this is going to be a fun one
[16.48 - 19.92] we're going to talk about a lot of
[17.56 - 22.16] different things all around that you
[19.92 - 24.56] should have your book by now if you
[22.16 - 27.92] pre-ordered it you should have it by now
[24.56 - 30.68] this is an unbelievable time I am so
[27.92 - 33.96] excited I am so excited
[30.68 - 35.12] if you uh read it more than once read it
[33.96 - 38.40] more than
[35.12 - 41.84] once um because there's there's a lot of
[38.40 - 44.16] hidden little jewels and gems in there H
[41.84 - 45.92] little diamonds that are in there and
[44.16 - 48.52] sometimes you know if you're you know if
[45.92 - 50.12] you're you hey you might get distracted
[48.52 - 51.28] with your phone or something else why
[50.12 - 54.48] you're in the middle of the book and
[51.28 - 57.32] skip over a part that's so critical or
[54.48 - 59.04] important and not realize it it it's so
[57.32 - 61.40] easy to happen that way cuz we live in a
[59.04 - 63.20] world of distraction So reading it again
[61.40 - 65.36] you might all of a sudden hit that spot
[63.20 - 67.00] and be like whoa wait a minute what or a
[65.36 - 69.44] couple of different spots so I don't
[67.00 - 72.76] want you to lose anything that's in
[69.44 - 75.20] there um so uh hopefully some of you
[72.76 - 79.64] have started reading it already and
[75.20 - 81.76] maybe you guys haven't but I'm excited I
[79.64 - 83.16] can't wait for you to dive into it we're
[81.76 - 84.68] going to be talking about a lot of great
[83.16 - 86.60] stuff here like I said before I'm
[84.68 - 90.32] honored that you're with me on this
[86.60 - 94.56] webinar right here um it's an important
[90.32 - 97.40] webinar it's an important time and you
[94.56 - 101.20] know knowing the truth about
[97.40 - 105.72] something um is that powerful is truly
[101.20 - 108.76] that powerful and it means it means a
[105.72 - 111.80] lot of freedom it means a lot of freedom
[108.76 - 114.00] you know not every truth has Freedom
[111.80 - 116.12] attached to it you know you've heard the
[114.00 - 118.48] saying oh there's still okay who's truth
[116.12 - 122.96] this truth that truth what is a truth is
[118.48 - 125.72] it not everybody claims the truth and um
[122.96 - 127.80] but what happens is is that the reason
[125.72 - 130.24] why truth is so confusing in so many
[127.80 - 133.44] different ways is because truth is
[130.24 - 136.84] backed by things that makes
[133.44 - 138.88] it kind of a a false truth so truth gets
[136.84 - 141.16] backed by things it gets backed by
[138.88 - 143.88] medical funding you know with lots of
[141.16 - 146.08] strings attached it gets backed by
[143.88 - 147.88] internal Kickbacks and persuaded belief
[146.08 - 151.16] systems and private panels of
[147.88 - 153.60] influencers and health field pay offs it
[151.16 - 156.48] gets backed by trendy traps and
[153.60 - 159.80] different interest groups it gets backed
[156.48 - 161.28] by things and that's why it's could be
[159.80 - 163.60] truthful some of it out there in the
[161.28 - 165.84] world of Internet information about
[163.60 - 167.68] thyroid or books or experts working on
[165.84 - 169.72] it but there could be pieces in there
[167.68 - 171.80] missing there could be pieces that are
[169.72 - 175.20] skewed like the thumb on the scale
[171.80 - 177.96] because it has stuff attached to it the
[175.20 - 180.40] information in here doesn't have any
[177.96 - 182.56] contamination attached to it so the
[180.40 - 187.48] information you have in front of you is
[182.56 - 190.24] clean it's clean it's not attached to
[187.48 - 192.20] something that's conditional something
[190.24 - 195.00] that's conditional that might have
[192.20 - 196.84] altered it or made it just right so it
[195.00 - 199.44] fits into the world
[196.84 - 200.88] today that's not how it should be you
[199.44 - 202.28] need to know the truth about your health
[200.88 - 205.20] you need to know the truth about your
[202.28 - 207.80] thyroid you need to learn these things
[205.20 - 210.24] it's so important to learn these things
[207.80 - 213.44] it is so important to know
[210.24 - 216.16] what the truth really is with healing
[213.44 - 219.32] and your thyroid in general with
[216.16 - 221.40] anything and so that information here
[219.32 - 224.72] comes from a pure place untampered with
[221.40 - 228.00] Place Advanced Clean Source a higher
[224.72 - 230.16] source and that's what the information
[228.00 - 232.44] is in here and that's what it is you
[230.16 - 235.84] know painstakingly I took the
[232.44 - 238.04] information down from my source um day
[235.84 - 240.84] in day out day in and day out and made
[238.04 - 246.48] sure it was in there just the way my
[240.84 - 249.12] source wanted it to be and um and so
[246.48 - 252.00] this doesn't have the thumb scale on it
[249.12 - 255.32] this doesn't have the dollars behind it
[252.00 - 257.60] this doesn't have things that make make
[255.32 - 260.00] it and shape it into something that fits
[257.60 - 261.68] just right so that all the interest
[260.00 - 263.36] groups out there in the medical Fields
[261.68 - 265.92] both conventional and alternative are
[263.36 - 267.84] happy no that's not what this is about
[265.92 - 271.16] this is about making you happy this is
[267.84 - 272.76] about meaning making you better not just
[271.16 - 275.48] not about making you happy making you
[272.76 - 277.76] better make giving you that freedom a
[275.48 - 278.60] false happiness this is the freedom that
[277.76 - 282.72] we
[278.60 - 285.48] need and um and to and to be a part of
[282.72 - 288.24] it together blows me away to be a part
[285.48 - 289.64] of it together blows me away seriously
[288.24 - 291.56] it really does so we're talking about
[289.64 - 293.24] Hashimoto today we're talking about
[291.56 - 294.76] Hashimoto we're talking about
[293.24 - 297.48] hyperthyroidism we're talking about
[294.76 - 299.36] hypothyroidism we're just talking about
[297.48 - 301.76] we're going to just Bop around and talk
[299.36 - 306.40] about a lot of different things there's
[301.76 - 308.52] cool stuff going on with all of it um
[306.40 - 309.88] I'm going to start a little bit with I
[308.52 - 312.28] think I'll start a little bit with
[309.88 - 315.12] history a little bit with history just
[312.28 - 316.80] about Hashimoto in general you know when
[315.12 - 319.60] you get diagnosed with
[316.80 - 322.20] Hashimoto you should think okay well I
[319.60 - 324.64] have something here meaning meaning
[322.20 - 326.96] science and research is there they're
[324.64 - 328.08] there they know they get it Hashimoto
[326.96 - 331.60] science and
[328.08 - 337.56] research there's nothing scientific or
[331.60 - 339.72] research about Hashimoto yet yet I'm
[337.56 - 341.64] just going to tell you right now that's
[339.72 - 344.20] what one of the saddest parts of it all
[341.64 - 347.60] is first of all it's discovered back in
[344.20 - 350.44] the early 1900s how by a physician
[347.60 - 351.56] putting his hand on a patient's throat
[350.44 - 352.68] and feeling that there might have been
[351.56 - 355.56] some
[352.68 - 358.16] inflammation and that's with thyroiditis
[355.56 - 361.32] was that was the birth of thyroiditis
[358.16 - 363.36] Hashimoto thyroiditis there it is that
[361.32 - 367.28] was the birth of it that was the birth
[363.36 - 370.32] of it and the only thing that's come out
[367.28 - 373.36] of it since then the only thing that's
[370.32 - 375.40] come out of it since then which is a
[373.36 - 378.60] theory a
[375.40 - 381.16] theory okay is the discovery of an
[378.60 - 384.36] antibody discovery of an auto
[381.16 - 386.64] antibody that Discovery okay but but not
[384.36 - 388.64] knowing what Auto antibodies do you guys
[386.64 - 391.20] not knowing what they do not having any
[388.64 - 394.08] clue any idea aidea just
[391.20 - 397.00] theoretically believing that an auto
[394.08 - 399.16] antibody is creating inflammation and
[397.00 - 401.00] attacking your thyroid that was just a
[399.16 - 403.44] theory that was a theory because it was
[401.00 - 405.08] the safest one to go to which backed
[403.44 - 406.52] science and research the reason why it
[405.08 - 409.00] backed science and
[406.52 - 410.68] research it backed science and research
[409.00 - 412.92] because it put the blame on you your
[410.68 - 414.56] body that was the safe fault for science
[412.92 - 415.88] and research is a perfect safe fault
[414.56 - 417.60] because science of research never wants
[415.88 - 420.20] to admit they're behind the times or
[417.60 - 422.64] they're in a non-discovery Zone they
[420.20 - 425.56] hate it they hate it they hate it they
[422.64 - 427.36] hate feeling or knowing that the
[425.56 - 428.84] billions of dollars and the trillions of
[427.36 - 431.00] dollars that have gone into science and
[428.84 - 434.20] research about anything they hate
[431.00 - 438.32] knowing it hasn't amounted to
[434.20 - 440.08] anything they hate that and so they have
[438.32 - 443.88] to take theories and they have to make
[440.08 - 446.08] them law law law of the land which only
[443.88 - 450.00] hurts you law of the land that only
[446.08 - 451.92] hurts you and that becomes false truth
[450.00 - 455.08] that becomes false
[451.92 - 458.52] truth that's what that becomes and then
[455.08 - 460.92] it becomes law of the land a fake truth
[458.52 - 464.32] a false truth becomes law of the
[460.92 - 466.52] land so Hashimoto is this so this only
[464.32 - 469.80] other thing that came out of Hashimoto
[466.52 - 473.16] in science is there was this discovery
[469.80 - 476.24] of of of a random Auto
[473.16 - 480.16] antibody with no identification of what
[476.24 - 483.28] it does or where it even goes where it
[480.16 - 487.32] even goes what it
[483.28 - 491.08] does nothing nothing just a
[487.32 - 493.48] theory attached to it it must be why you
[491.08 - 495.64] get
[493.48 - 498.76] thyroiditis and that's how bad things
[495.64 - 500.44] are that's how sad things are and that's
[498.76 - 503.80] where we are with the most advanced in
[500.44 - 505.32] in in in thyroid and somebody one of you
[503.80 - 506.88] might be out there saying well no not
[505.32 - 507.84] true there's all these triggers and all
[506.88 - 510.16] this other stuff we're going to talk
[507.84 - 511.68] about triggers
[510.16 - 514.60] we're going to talk about
[511.68 - 517.48] triggers but but and you'll see there's
[514.60 - 519.80] a list of triggers actually that I put
[517.48 - 522.48] in there you'll see it the list of
[519.80 - 523.88] triggers but they're just triggers
[522.48 - 526.68] they're not the cause they're just
[523.88 - 529.96] triggers they're just triggers just like
[526.68 - 534.96] anything just like any kind of
[529.96 - 536.88] trigger just a trigger so so the theory
[534.96 - 539.28] was the only thing that came next after
[536.88 - 544.56] all that 10 and something years here we
[539.28 - 546.64] we are what year is it now and look two
[544.56 - 550.56] things came out of Hashimoto's
[546.64 - 552.20] thyroiditis two things a guy feeling
[550.56 - 553.88] somebody's thyroid which named it
[552.20 - 558.52] Hashimoto's
[553.88 - 560.52] thyroiditis and a guy 50 years later a
[558.52 - 563.32] guy 50 years later a doctor 50 years
[560.52 - 565.48] later finding an auto antibody but not
[563.32 - 567.56] having a clue to what it does so it was
[565.48 - 570.28] a madeup
[567.56 - 572.28] theory compounded
[570.28 - 574.28] that was basically well this is probably
[572.28 - 578.00] what it's doing let's do this it's the
[574.28 - 581.76] safest way out let's create the
[578.00 - 583.32] autoimmune fallacy the autoimmune Theory
[581.76 - 586.44] the autoimmune theory of your body
[583.32 - 591.12] destroying itself cuz you know why it it
[586.44 - 593.72] sets it protects science and research
[591.12 - 597.44] till the cows come home till the cows
[593.72 - 599.52] come home it protects and protects and
[597.44 - 602.24] protects and protects like you don't
[599.52 - 604.28] even know because it's your fault that's
[602.24 - 606.12] your body being faulty and since they
[604.28 - 609.24] still don't have answers to what causes
[606.12 - 610.92] anything it becomes your genes now and
[609.24 - 614.32] you'll see a little genan section in
[610.92 - 616.32] this book read that read that baby like
[614.32 - 620.08] three four times that Gene
[616.32 - 622.92] section you have to Deb brainwash
[620.08 - 625.60] yourself it's so critical it's so
[622.92 - 628.04] critical to Healing it's so critical to
[625.60 - 633.20] the conditioning that
[628.04 - 634.76] occurs so this is an important step this
[633.20 - 638.44] is an important
[634.76 - 639.16] step right here where we are in history
[638.44 - 642.00] right
[639.16 - 643.64] now this information is an important
[642.00 - 646.32] step in history right now this just
[643.64 - 650.52] isn't just a book you
[646.32 - 654.32] know is isn't a book to do anything like
[650.52 - 656.80] further my career or anything like that
[654.32 - 658.56] it's not that's not what it is you know
[656.80 - 660.80] it's a funny thing someone even said to
[658.56 - 663.84] me ah you
[660.80 - 666.12] authors this isn't a memoir this isn't
[663.84 - 669.28] you know yeah I'd love to do something
[666.12 - 671.24] silly like uh a whole book on on the
[669.28 - 674.88] medical medium starting from when I was
[671.24 - 677.52] birthed to to now and in a whole you
[674.88 - 679.56] know level of the painstaking crap I've
[677.52 - 682.36] gone through my whole entire life
[679.56 - 683.60] hearing Spirit it'd be a fun book
[682.36 - 687.48] meaning to
[683.60 - 689.96] read it would just you know further my
[687.48 - 691.44] career on that way
[689.96 - 693.84] and that's not what these books are
[691.44 - 697.20] about I put a little touch the origins
[693.84 - 699.48] of of of me in the first
[697.20 - 701.12] book but what it's about is getting you
[699.48 - 704.12] the truth and the information that's all
[701.12 - 707.28] I care about I I'm not going to be able
[704.12 - 709.56] to cover the whole book in this webinar
[707.28 - 711.60] but we're going to cover what we can but
[709.56 - 713.32] I had I have to give you the basis of
[711.60 - 716.44] the understanding of the
[713.32 - 718.72] two the two discoveries is all we have
[716.44 - 720.24] for thyroid meaning the two discoveries
[718.72 - 723.40] that's signs and research have that
[720.24 - 725.20] everybody's holding on to literally like
[723.40 - 728.44] it's like it's
[725.20 - 730.20] everything a mystery Auto antibody that
[728.44 - 732.44] no one knows what's going on or what
[730.20 - 734.00] it's doing putting the blame on you that
[732.44 - 735.52] your body's attacking itself and
[734.00 - 737.80] destroying itself and destroying the
[735.52 - 740.08] thyroid and at the same time the
[737.80 - 743.52] discovery of hasimoto to begin with some
[740.08 - 746.08] guy some guy felt a swollen thyroid back
[743.52 - 746.08] in the early
[746.32 - 751.56] 1900s and let me tell you something I do
[749.20 - 752.56] respect and appreciate both of those
[751.56 - 754.76] very
[752.56 - 757.20] things as much as I sound like I'm
[754.76 - 759.84] talking down about it I'm talking down
[757.20 - 762.80] about the fact that it becomes law and
[759.84 - 764.96] nobody just even has a clue or debates
[762.80 - 767.04] it or understands any of it nobody in
[764.96 - 769.12] the professional world of medicine or
[767.04 - 771.04] anything and just move just keep on
[769.12 - 773.08] moving
[771.04 - 776.76] forward and then you don't get the
[773.08 - 780.36] answers you need you don't get the truth
[776.76 - 781.76] you don't you don't get any of that
[780.36 - 783.44] we're going to talk about Epstein bar a
[781.76 - 785.56] little bit Epstein bar gets into the
[783.44 - 786.88] thyroid and that's what causes Hashimoto
[785.56 - 789.28] we're going to go into it a little
[786.88 - 791.72] deeper today but you'll see the new
[789.28 - 793.64] experts that recently took information
[791.72 - 796.72] from book one the origins you know book
[793.64 - 799.84] one medical medium they took information
[796.72 - 801.52] because spirit and I published how it
[799.84 - 802.72] works with Epstein bar and the thyroid
[801.52 - 804.12] and everything like that and they took
[802.72 - 806.00] it and they sprinkled it on their
[804.12 - 807.84] websites and they sprinkled it in and
[806.00 - 809.76] out of their their other kind of books
[807.84 - 812.12] now thyroid books sprinkle it in and out
[809.76 - 814.68] because they don't want to be left out
[812.12 - 817.08] but they call it a trigger because they
[814.68 - 818.84] just don't trust in the fact of what's
[817.08 - 822.40] going on because they're so married to
[818.84 - 825.12] the laws the two laws a guy in 1950 in
[822.40 - 826.72] the 1950s that found an auto antibody
[825.12 - 829.16] but doesn't know what's going on so the
[826.72 - 830.40] theory became it's your body attacking
[829.16 - 832.28] itself and then of course the guy
[830.40 - 833.88] Hashimoto felt the thyroid and felt it
[832.28 - 836.16] was swollen they don't want to leave
[833.88 - 836.16] these
[836.76 - 842.08] laws but that doesn't really protect you
[840.40 - 843.68] sure you could clean up the diet maybe
[842.08 - 848.36] get your numbers a little better on the
[843.68 - 848.36] thyroid but that's not the answer either
[848.88 - 855.28] entirely this is serious stuff we're
[851.36 - 856.32] talking about this is serious stuff this
[855.28 - 858.48] is no
[856.32 - 861.32] joke this is no
[858.48 - 865.88] joke
[861.32 - 869.12] so um by the way you
[865.88 - 871.00] know have your tea have your herbal
[869.12 - 872.40] whatever you need I got mine right here
[871.00 - 874.64] because we're going to go deeper into
[872.40 - 876.32] this and we got we got a lot of time
[874.64 - 878.08] we're going to be doing this so I'm
[876.32 - 882.32] going to be sipping some tea along the
[878.08 - 884.76] way being this is live it's uh you know
[882.32 - 888.28] might get a little dry throat from
[884.76 - 890.24] talking so much but thank you for just
[888.28 - 892.72] listening and holding on tight fasten
[890.24 - 894.96] the seat belts is what I'm saying if
[892.72 - 896.60] you've already done that because already
[894.96 - 898.20] you should have the seat belt fastened
[896.60 - 899.64] for just what we're talking about just
[898.20 - 901.72] what we've been talking
[899.64 - 903.64] about we should already have them
[901.72 - 904.92] fastened all right so talk a little bit
[903.64 - 908.04] about the
[904.92 - 910.68] history of hashimotos the swollen
[908.04 - 914.88] thyroid now
[910.68 - 918.08] originally in the 17 1800s late 1700s
[914.88 - 921.48] early 1800s originally right around that
[918.08 - 923.56] time there was there was a goer
[921.48 - 926.24] developing this was from iodine
[923.56 - 930.48] deficiencies in certain areas of the
[926.24 - 933.16] world goers and that was from a real
[930.48 - 936.20] true 100% you know iodine
[933.16 - 938.20] deficiency that was different than the
[936.20 - 940.52] thyroiditis always different than the
[938.20 - 941.96] thyroiditis that was creeping up come
[940.52 - 945.24] around the turn of the
[941.96 - 947.16] century right around the late 1800s all
[945.24 - 949.00] these food experiments were happening
[947.16 - 950.72] that not even people know when they know
[949.00 - 952.84] about the Green Revolution and they know
[950.72 - 956.12] about all that kind of stuff that was
[952.84 - 959.36] going on in 1950s and how food was being
[956.12 - 961.48] you know um monog grown and sprays were
[959.36 - 963.80] being you know uh the whole thing with
[961.48 - 967.36] pesticides and everything there were a
[963.80 - 970.84] lot of different experiments pre
[967.36 - 976.40] 1900 all in the late you know in the
[970.84 - 978.60] 1860s 1870s 1880s tremendous experience
[976.40 - 981.84] experiments I mean lots of them
[978.60 - 985.72] tremendous amounts of them I mean due to
[981.84 - 987.80] food they were dropping off canisters at
[985.72 - 989.08] every Farm whether it's small Mom and
[987.80 - 991.92] Pop to a little bit bigger to
[989.08 - 994.76] everybody's backyard to farmers markets
[991.92 - 998.12] dropping off cans of contaminated
[994.76 - 1001.60] materials to BL and put
[998.12 - 1005.28] on everybody's food that was growing in
[1001.60 - 1007.88] that time 1860 1870 this is
[1005.28 - 1010.08] completely hidden hidden in the in the
[1007.88 - 1011.28] world because people can't handle this
[1010.08 - 1013.68] they just don't want to they didn't want
[1011.28 - 1016.72] to know then they don't want to know
[1013.68 - 1017.48] now these were experimental insecticides
[1016.72 - 1019.60] the
[1017.48 - 1021.24] earliest these were experimental
[1019.60 - 1022.56] antibiotics before the birth of
[1021.24 - 1024.84] antibiotics before the birth of
[1022.56 - 1028.20] penicillin in the
[1024.84 - 1031.76] 1900s and it was experimented on our
[1028.20 - 1034.56] food really broke our immune systems
[1031.76 - 1038.60] down like never before in
[1034.56 - 1040.76] history it also fed a harmless bug a
[1038.60 - 1044.48] friendly little bug that was never
[1040.76 - 1048.04] against us ever which was Epstein
[1044.48 - 1049.92] bar Epstein bar it was a virus that
[1048.04 - 1054.00] actually only worked in our favor it
[1049.92 - 1056.08] destroyed enemies and it helped us it
[1054.00 - 1060.36] was a friend not a
[1056.08 - 1064.12] foe it was a friend a friend friend to
[1060.36 - 1068.68] our immune system it protected us from
[1064.12 - 1071.72] disease it was a bug actually it had not
[1068.68 - 1074.32] a mean streak in it on any level but it
[1071.72 - 1075.88] was tampered with and it was fed poison
[1074.32 - 1080.00] and it was beaten
[1075.88 - 1083.16] down and by 1900
[1080.00 - 1084.68] it was getting into some thyroids was
[1083.16 - 1086.92] creating the first
[1084.68 - 1088.60] thyroiditis the first thyroiditis that
[1086.92 - 1091.88] wasn't just an iodine
[1088.60 - 1095.36] deficiency it wasn't just a
[1091.88 - 1098.28] goer and it got into the thyroid isn't
[1095.36 - 1100.44] this fun isn't this fun though I'm still
[1098.28 - 1102.76] have I'm having too much fun I'm sorry
[1100.44 - 1105.60] I'm sorry I'm having too much fun I just
[1102.76 - 1107.96] I waited for this this book to come out
[1105.60 - 1109.20] I just waited we waited we waited okay
[1107.96 - 1112.92] all right
[1109.20 - 1115.60] so the virus became a little bit more
[1112.92 - 1119.60] meaner developed a little bit
[1115.60 - 1121.64] more of a meanor streak it wasn't in
[1119.60 - 1124.52] everybody it wasn't spread it wasn't
[1121.64 - 1126.88] spread to everybody it wasn't getting
[1124.52 - 1131.40] too far there weren't a lot of
[1126.88 - 1131.40] cases of this thyroiditis it was
[1131.68 - 1138.40] rare But as time went on in the
[1135.36 - 1140.40] 1900s the virus changed and it mutated
[1138.40 - 1144.04] ated and a few more strains developed
[1140.40 - 1147.24] and by 1940 women discovered they had
[1144.04 - 1150.32] symptoms for the first time in women's
[1147.24 - 1153.28] history of the symptoms they had which
[1150.32 - 1154.96] seemed like very which seemed very odd
[1153.28 - 1157.28] and strange medical community was
[1154.96 - 1159.04] completely baffled 100% had no idea what
[1157.28 - 1160.80] the hell was going on there were
[1159.04 - 1162.80] neurological symptoms there were the hot
[1160.80 - 1165.52] flashes hot flashes in the first time
[1162.80 - 1167.24] first time ever real recorded documented
[1165.52 - 1169.36] hot
[1167.24 - 1171.00] flashes up and down temperature
[1169.36 - 1173.68] fluctuations
[1171.00 - 1176.52] fevers aches and pains
[1173.68 - 1178.92] fatigue hair falling out hair falling
[1176.52 - 1181.84] out hair didn't fall out before then
[1178.92 - 1184.60] hair didn't fall out before
[1181.84 - 1187.72] then there were you know hair loss the
[1184.60 - 1190.28] brittle nails all the different
[1187.72 - 1192.52] symptoms and medical science was
[1190.28 - 1195.44] completely
[1192.52 - 1197.16] baffled and what was happening was the
[1195.44 - 1199.08] epin bar virus was growing into
[1197.16 - 1200.12] something different growing into
[1199.08 - 1202.76] something
[1200.12 - 1205.44] different and more cases of thyroiditis
[1202.76 - 1208.04] were developing more thyroid problems
[1205.44 - 1209.04] for women more cases of thyroiditis were
[1208.04 - 1211.12] uh was
[1209.04 - 1214.20] developing
[1211.12 - 1216.20] and Medical Research Medical Science
[1214.20 - 1218.32] didn't know what to do besides they were
[1216.20 - 1219.88] already in the process in the late 40s
[1218.32 - 1221.52] and mid mid to late 40s they were
[1219.88 - 1224.16] already in the process of developing and
[1221.52 - 1226.68] working on hormones they're working on
[1224.16 - 1229.48] hormones they were in the process this
[1226.68 - 1233.40] was the perfect perfect match ever
[1229.48 - 1235.68] before in history the perfect match by
[1233.40 - 1238.20] 1950s so many women were literally
[1235.68 - 1240.56] lining the doctor's
[1238.20 - 1243.20] offices the ones that were
[1240.56 - 1245.04] wealthy they were told they had a they
[1243.20 - 1246.36] they they had a problem the ones that
[1245.04 - 1248.48] weren't wealthy were told they were
[1246.36 - 1250.24] insane that's how medicine worked back
[1248.48 - 1251.92] then by the way that's how conventional
[1250.24 - 1254.12] medicine worked this is an alternative
[1251.92 - 1256.48] medicine alternative medicine was a
[1254.12 - 1258.36] beautiful thing back then no doubt
[1256.48 - 1261.84] conventional medicine was an absolutely
[1258.36 - 1264.52] hot mess a complete disaster at this
[1261.84 - 1266.76] point so when very wealthy rich women
[1264.52 - 1268.56] came into the doctor's office the
[1266.76 - 1270.64] doctors are like well you know you do
[1268.56 - 1272.52] have something going on and now since
[1270.64 - 1274.28] big Pharma gave us all these hormones
[1272.52 - 1275.36] here let's let's make sure we apply
[1274.28 - 1276.92] these because we think you have just
[1275.36 - 1278.68] hormone problems and they were really
[1276.92 - 1281.52] steroidal these hormones that they were
[1278.68 - 1283.24] giving these women which led to some
[1281.52 - 1285.68] suppression of some of the symptoms but
[1283.24 - 1287.68] not a lot of suppression at all in fact
[1285.68 - 1291.20] even worse symptoms in many to most
[1287.68 - 1294.44] women at that point but it was
[1291.20 - 1296.48] completely birthed the hormone movement
[1294.44 - 1298.44] at that point of it's your hormones it's
[1296.48 - 1299.80] your hormones women that were poor that
[1298.44 - 1301.92] went to the doctor that got to the
[1299.80 - 1304.08] doctor and they were on the lower class
[1301.92 - 1305.36] scale at that time frame in history they
[1304.08 - 1309.72] were told they were
[1305.36 - 1314.88] nuts just hysterical crazy lying
[1309.72 - 1317.72] bored so and um and maybe hormonal too
[1314.88 - 1320.48] depending on who the doctor was so this
[1317.72 - 1323.88] is what was going on in this time frame
[1320.48 - 1323.88] medicine was was
[1324.52 - 1329.96] disgusting and you know and so but what
[1327.16 - 1334.64] was really happening was Epstein bar all
[1329.96 - 1339.60] the women that were born in 1900 1905
[1334.64 - 1342.60] 1904 1894 1898
[1339.60 - 1342.60] 1897
[1342.84 - 1350.04] 1910 by the 40s and 50s 1940s and 1950s
[1347.48 - 1351.72] they were 40 years old 45 years old 50
[1350.04 - 1355.04] years old so it seemed like it matched
[1351.72 - 1357.24] the change of the of of
[1355.04 - 1359.20] menopause so that's why the hormonal
[1357.24 - 1360.72] thing just really kicked in as being the
[1359.20 - 1363.12] the the the tell all for what these
[1360.72 - 1364.84] symptoms were but before that women in
[1363.12 - 1366.40] their 40s didn't experience that women
[1364.84 - 1370.48] in their 50s didn't experience that
[1366.40 - 1373.76] before that this is a firsttime thing in
[1370.48 - 1376.96] history the change was never a painful
[1373.76 - 1382.20] toxic kind of
[1376.96 - 1384.44] thing meaning both emotionally mentally
[1382.20 - 1387.68] historically but it was the Epstein bar
[1384.44 - 1390.52] creating a whole new barrage of
[1387.68 - 1393.24] symptoms and thyroid problems were more
[1390.52 - 1395.12] common too more common which leads to
[1393.24 - 1396.52] where we are today where the experts
[1395.12 - 1398.48] today are like well the thyroid is
[1396.52 - 1400.80] causing most of all this now yes and
[1398.48 - 1402.00] you're going through a change and the
[1400.80 - 1403.80] thyroid is causing most of these
[1402.00 - 1407.08] problems now because it's all kind of
[1403.80 - 1409.04] seeming like the same time frame but not
[1407.08 - 1411.48] really because women now in their 20s
[1409.04 - 1415.68] have thyroid problems 30s have in their
[1411.48 - 1417.68] 20s and early 30s teens have thyroid
[1415.68 - 1420.72] problems so that's also kind of a
[1417.68 - 1423.04] baffling aspect of it all but they're
[1420.72 - 1425.00] just it's all just thrown into hey it's
[1423.04 - 1426.00] autoimmune in the bodies attacking these
[1425.00 - 1429.48] young women
[1426.00 - 1432.04] early on the basis of that false Theory
[1429.48 - 1432.04] to begin
[1432.96 - 1439.48] with so right now today we're in a place
[1437.32 - 1442.12] where Hashim Oto we think we have the
[1439.48 - 1444.68] answers when we don't we do now what's
[1442.12 - 1448.00] in your hand it's
[1444.68 - 1450.72] there but we're still in Antiquity land
[1448.00 - 1453.04] until we drop a the body's attacking
[1450.72 - 1454.56] itself and going after the thyroid and
[1453.04 - 1456.16] these Auto antibodies are there to
[1454.56 - 1457.56] destroy the thyroid and if we can get
[1456.16 - 1459.76] out of that land then we're out of
[1457.56 - 1463.08] antiquity
[1459.76 - 1466.76] land but we're not going to get out of
[1463.08 - 1469.00] there because that married law is still
[1466.76 - 1470.88] in is still going to impregnate and
[1469.00 - 1472.28] still going to saturate every single
[1470.88 - 1475.48] expert from here on out that's coming
[1472.28 - 1478.08] out except you as an expert you it
[1475.48 - 1481.72] won't you're getting the
[1478.08 - 1483.44] truth you know when it says the truth in
[1481.72 - 1486.96] the subtitle of the
[1483.44 - 1489.40] book when it's anything medical medium
[1486.96 - 1492.20] then it's the darn
[1489.40 - 1494.16] truth you need to know the difference
[1492.20 - 1496.32] between that and the truth you see and a
[1494.16 - 1498.24] lot of other self- health books you need
[1496.32 - 1499.72] to know the difference this is the
[1498.24 - 1501.76] difference you're hearing it now you're
[1499.72 - 1503.72] going to read it it's important to
[1501.76 - 1505.24] understand this isn't me boasting this
[1503.72 - 1506.64] is about taking Health seriously and
[1505.24 - 1509.20] really getting better this is about
[1506.64 - 1511.08] really making a difference with the
[1509.20 - 1512.60] people around you you yourself if it's
[1511.08 - 1514.52] just you yourself then that's that's
[1512.60 - 1516.96] that's all I need if it's people around
[1514.52 - 1518.56] you great that's wonderful it's people
[1516.96 - 1521.04] around them wonderful if it's getting
[1518.56 - 1524.44] the message out wonderful whatever it
[1521.04 - 1526.68] is whatever it
[1524.44 - 1530.36] is
[1526.68 - 1532.24] Hashimoto is a stage of Epstein bar
[1530.36 - 1534.24] after Epstein bar leaves the liver
[1532.24 - 1536.68] Epstein bar leaves the liver and it
[1534.24 - 1540.08] heads to the
[1536.68 - 1544.12] thyroid and Hashimoto thyroiditis is a
[1540.08 - 1546.28] stage hypothyroidism is a stage it's
[1544.12 - 1549.00] just the same thing it's the virus
[1546.28 - 1551.72] leaving the liver going into the thyroid
[1549.00 - 1551.72] that's the Epstein
[1552.08 - 1559.08] bar and the Hashimoto is a little bit
[1556.20 - 1561.68] more heavy dut Beauty version where it's
[1559.08 - 1564.32] not just keeping at a hypothyroid but
[1561.68 - 1566.64] it's all the same a lot of people with
[1564.32 - 1569.20] hypothyroid end up hashimotos later
[1566.64 - 1571.16] because the thyroid was in the the the
[1569.20 - 1572.52] thyroid was in the stage of the Epstein
[1571.16 - 1575.68] bar sitting in there working on the
[1572.52 - 1578.72] thyroid so over time it then
[1575.68 - 1580.96] became seeable as far as antibodies
[1578.72 - 1583.48] being pre present in the blood
[1580.96 - 1584.84] work but that's also a lot of times you
[1583.48 - 1586.28] can have Auto antibodies and it's not
[1584.84 - 1588.80] even present in the blood works so you
[1586.28 - 1590.32] can even have that with hypothyroid
[1588.80 - 1592.64] doctor won't even know cuz blood tests
[1590.32 - 1595.08] aren't aren't so easy to read which
[1592.64 - 1597.28] you'll see there's a guest tests guest
[1595.08 - 1599.76] test chapter in this in this book
[1597.28 - 1601.80] thyroid guest tests talking about how
[1599.76 - 1603.08] why and what why it's so difficult and
[1601.80 - 1604.88] why a lot of doctors now and
[1603.08 - 1606.76] practitioners are guessing and just
[1604.88 - 1609.20] saying well you need to go on thyroid
[1606.76 - 1611.12] medication you need to be on thyroid
[1609.20 - 1613.08] medication even though your numbers look
[1611.12 - 1616.60] good or they look borderline you'll see
[1613.08 - 1620.00] why when you read that
[1616.60 - 1621.04] chapter and so what is going on with the
[1620.00 - 1623.52] auto
[1621.04 - 1625.40] antibody well as you'll also read the
[1623.52 - 1627.32] auto antibody is designed by your immune
[1625.40 - 1630.96] system to go after only one thing a
[1627.32 - 1633.72] virus it has tagged a virus it has
[1630.96 - 1636.08] tagged a virus it has
[1633.72 - 1637.68] found it's not going after thyroid
[1636.08 - 1639.96] tissue the virus goes after thyroid
[1637.68 - 1642.72] tissue the virus inflames the virus
[1639.96 - 1646.56] itself inflames and this is not known
[1642.72 - 1649.04] till this day it is not known yet in any
[1646.56 - 1652.24] in any
[1649.04 - 1653.60] place in any place where we got the
[1652.24 - 1656.72] research of Science and we got the
[1653.60 - 1659.12] experts it's just not known
[1656.72 - 1661.00] yet will they ever learn down the road
[1659.12 - 1665.40] it depends because breaking the
[1661.00 - 1667.40] autoimmune Theory means admitting you
[1665.40 - 1669.76] don't science of research doesn't know
[1667.40 - 1671.40] what's wrong with their patients yet it
[1669.76 - 1673.08] admits that and that it's not the
[1671.40 - 1674.60] patient's fault and it's not your body
[1673.08 - 1677.80] attacking itself and that's not going to
[1674.60 - 1681.72] be something easily admitt ever by the
[1677.80 - 1684.40] medical research department or in even
[1681.72 - 1686.76] experts that put out books because it it
[1684.40 - 1689.72] it it it it outdates their book
[1686.76 - 1693.12] instantly in the thyroid
[1689.72 - 1694.60] Market think about it that's serious you
[1693.12 - 1698.28] put out a book you got something you
[1694.60 - 1700.48] believe in but you can't drop a theory
[1698.28 - 1702.44] to get people better to move forward
[1700.48 - 1704.84] because it it it cancels out what you
[1702.44 - 1707.08] did in your work so how is it ever going
[1704.84 - 1709.24] to change think about that right I mean
[1707.08 - 1711.20] that's difficult and I don't blame a
[1709.24 - 1713.16] practitioner or a Healer or a doctor
[1711.20 - 1715.48] that's written a book that has outdated
[1713.16 - 1718.20] thyroid information I don't blame them
[1715.48 - 1721.92] at all it's like it's like your work is
[1718.20 - 1725.76] all there and then you're like holy crap
[1721.92 - 1729.04] I can't let those theories down because
[1725.76 - 1732.68] it means it it outdates my book the work
[1729.04 - 1734.24] I put into and that's why it's that hard
[1732.68 - 1736.68] to get people
[1734.24 - 1738.20] better that alone is that what that's
[1736.68 - 1740.44] that's that's why it's that hard to get
[1738.20 - 1740.44] people
[1740.88 - 1746.20] better so the auto
[1744.16 - 1749.96] antibody the auto
[1746.20 - 1752.32] antibody goes after the virus itself and
[1749.96 - 1753.96] only the virus the body is brilliant
[1752.32 - 1756.28] your body is brilliant your body is such
[1753.96 - 1759.08] a healing machine oh my
[1756.28 - 1761.08] God lord it's a healing
[1759.08 - 1764.24] machine like no
[1761.08 - 1767.48] other your immune system is like no
[1764.24 - 1769.80] other it sends out soldiers it creates
[1767.48 - 1772.84] soldiers called Auto
[1769.80 - 1775.64] antibodies not Auto as in destructing
[1772.84 - 1779.04] you and hurting you or whatever no no no
[1775.64 - 1780.88] no is going specifically after the virus
[1779.04 - 1783.12] and even if research and science
[1780.88 - 1785.80] discovered this they probably
[1783.12 - 1788.04] wouldn't put it out
[1785.80 - 1789.60] there because it means they have to open
[1788.04 - 1791.00] up such a huge can of worms about
[1789.60 - 1794.80] Epstein bar and they have to give
[1791.00 - 1797.28] Anthony upstein and Dr bar
[1794.80 - 1799.04] credit and then they have to find billi
[1797.28 - 1800.88] ions of dollars and do research on
[1799.04 - 1802.40] Epstein bar they so don't want to go
[1800.88 - 1805.08] there because it takes billions away
[1802.40 - 1808.48] from investing into genes and genetics
[1805.08 - 1810.92] which puts the blame on you once again
[1808.48 - 1812.60] so how are we ever going to get that
[1810.92 - 1815.60] truth out there well we're going to get
[1812.60 - 1816.88] it out there you guys us we're going to
[1815.60 - 1820.40] get it out
[1816.88 - 1822.88] there takes a little time got to have
[1820.40 - 1824.72] patience but that auto antibody goes
[1822.88 - 1827.56] exactly after the virus and only after
[1824.72 - 1830.32] the virus it's there to break down that
[1827.56 - 1830.32] virus go after
[1830.36 - 1837.76] it and even when it's not detectable
[1833.88 - 1839.72] on on a blood test or through blood
[1837.76 - 1842.44] blood profile even if it's not even you
[1839.72 - 1844.84] can find it even if you can't even find
[1842.44 - 1847.08] it your body's still going after that
[1844.84 - 1850.60] virus even when you're in just hypo
[1847.08 - 1850.60] instead of just
[1851.96 - 1856.56] Hashi it's going after the virus it's
[1855.20 - 1857.84] designed to go after the virus it's
[1856.56 - 1860.48] actually programmed to go after the
[1857.84 - 1863.76] virus it's it's
[1860.48 - 1866.20] tagged to go after the virus it's
[1863.76 - 1868.44] looking to only tag the virus
[1866.20 - 1870.00] itself the virus is what causes the
[1868.44 - 1871.60] inflammation inside the thyroid the
[1870.00 - 1874.52] virus is what causes cigar tissue the
[1871.60 - 1876.56] virus is what causes uh thyroid nodules
[1874.52 - 1881.44] the virus is which what causes any kind
[1876.56 - 1884.48] of cyst or any kind of tumor inside a
[1881.44 - 1885.72] thyroid all from the Epstein bar there's
[1884.48 - 1889.16] different varieties you'll read about
[1885.72 - 1889.16] those two
[1889.80 - 1896.04] and is this information
[1893.12 - 1898.16] helpful it's beyond
[1896.04 - 1899.96] helpful because when you know your body
[1898.16 - 1902.96] is doing the right thing and you know
[1899.96 - 1907.36] it's going after something the right way
[1902.96 - 1907.36] you can heal fast and
[1907.56 - 1912.52] faster knowledge is power when it comes
[1909.92 - 1914.88] down to this it comes down to this
[1912.52 - 1918.88] knowledge is incredibly powerful I can't
[1914.88 - 1923.24] even say it enough incredibly
[1918.88 - 1923.24] powerful I can't even say it
[1924.24 - 1931.12] enough so let's talk
[1928.20 - 1933.68] about symptoms a little bit H
[1931.12 - 1935.28] hypothyroid symptoms what you're
[1933.68 - 1936.60] experiencing when you're experiencing
[1935.28 - 1938.88] hashimotos or
[1936.60 - 1940.36] hypothyroid those symptoms aren't the
[1938.88 - 1943.24] thyroid causing it and you're going to
[1940.36 - 1945.16] learn that there's very few symptoms the
[1943.24 - 1947.96] thyroid actually causes from bonking out
[1945.16 - 1950.24] on us from getting affected by Epstein
[1947.96 - 1951.92] bar in anyway very few symptoms some
[1950.24 - 1955.40] temperature fluctuations is pretty much
[1951.92 - 1958.52] it I think maybe a couple more I put in
[1955.40 - 1961.64] there but that's
[1958.52 - 1963.56] it well there's a lot of people I I know
[1961.64 - 1965.48] somebody's mind is blown there's a lot
[1963.56 - 1968.80] of people and I'm going to explain this
[1965.48 - 1970.24] that's why there's a lot of people they
[1968.80 - 1971.80] get their hormones balanced just right
[1970.24 - 1975.24] for the
[1971.80 - 1977.44] thyroid they get rid of even I mean
[1975.24 - 1979.00] their Auto antibodies don't even show
[1977.44 - 1980.32] but they're still dealing with lots of
[1979.00 - 1981.48] symptoms they always have they're still
[1980.32 - 1982.68] dealing with the fatigue or they're
[1981.48 - 1983.68] still dealing with something else or
[1982.68 - 1985.32] they're still dealing with some
[1983.68 - 1987.48] different symptom they're still dealing
[1985.32 - 1990.60] with weight gain whatever it
[1987.48 - 1993.24] is because it's not coming from the
[1990.60 - 1995.00] thyroid and I explain in symptoms and
[1993.24 - 1997.24] conditions list you'll see where a lot
[1995.00 - 2000.64] of these symptoms are coming
[1997.24 - 2003.68] from I can't believe I can even say that
[2000.64 - 2003.68] that means you got the
[2005.96 - 2011.88] book
[2007.76 - 2015.40] and that that's that's amazing so
[2011.88 - 2018.08] understand that Hashimoto and
[2015.40 - 2019.36] hypothyroidism the symptoms are not
[2018.08 - 2022.36] thyroid
[2019.36 - 2024.80] related but they're liver related other
[2022.36 - 2027.48] things related they're viral related
[2024.80 - 2032.12] they're about being
[2027.48 - 2034.92] viral I've had people without a
[2032.12 - 2038.24] thyroid have all the same symptoms
[2034.92 - 2039.88] nothing went away nothing changed
[2038.24 - 2041.44] or they had their thyroid killed off all
[2039.88 - 2043.08] the same symptoms they had their the
[2041.44 - 2044.48] hormones up to par the hormones were up
[2043.08 - 2047.48] the
[2044.48 - 2049.36] level all the same symptoms same thing
[2047.48 - 2050.64] with somebody with hypothyroid all the
[2049.36 - 2053.16] same
[2050.64 - 2054.72] symptoms sometimes a thyroid medication
[2053.16 - 2057.16] can suppress and I talk about that in
[2054.72 - 2060.04] here it's a steroid so it can suppress
[2057.16 - 2061.56] some symptoms and they put a lot of of
[2060.04 - 2063.00] thyroid medication in you the reason why
[2061.56 - 2064.68] is cuz you're they want to keep those
[2063.00 - 2066.40] numbers up because the liver keeps on
[2064.68 - 2067.76] sucking up that medication sucking up
[2066.40 - 2069.92] that medication sucking up that
[2067.76 - 2071.40] medication and keeps on absorbing it
[2069.92 - 2072.96] finally the liver maxes out and it's
[2071.40 - 2074.68] like I can't absorb anymore and then
[2072.96 - 2076.08] finally you get balanced meaning they're
[2074.68 - 2078.40] like okay you don't have to really
[2076.08 - 2080.36] change your your your thyroid medication
[2078.40 - 2081.84] amount because it seems to be level in
[2080.36 - 2084.28] the bloodstream that's cu the liver had
[2081.84 - 2084.28] to fill
[2085.08 - 2090.48] up and with all that steroid compound
[2087.52 - 2093.60] floating around it can sometimes
[2090.48 - 2096.16] suppress symptoms viral symptoms and
[2093.60 - 2098.36] sometimes it doesn't you'll read about a
[2096.16 - 2100.32] little bit of that to
[2098.36 - 2103.12] too
[2100.32 - 2105.20] so what happens is just like it happened
[2103.12 - 2106.64] starting in 1940s and 1950s all these
[2105.20 - 2109.72] symptoms
[2106.64 - 2112.40] occurred and the blame was on hormones
[2109.72 - 2115.08] only like the change the menopause men
[2112.40 - 2118.68] had had these symptoms they didn't
[2115.08 - 2121.96] complain it was a stoic time back then
[2118.68 - 2124.04] and Men weren't allowed to complain they
[2121.96 - 2125.80] were scared to death to tell their
[2124.04 - 2128.00] doctor they had a
[2125.80 - 2129.52] symptom they were also scared to death
[2128.00 - 2131.32] of telling their workplace because they
[2129.52 - 2135.16] would be
[2131.32 - 2138.36] fired let go seen as unusable or not
[2135.16 - 2140.08] usable or not or useless symptoms were
[2138.36 - 2143.80] not a good
[2140.08 - 2145.24] thing if a man had hot flashes it was
[2143.80 - 2149.88] totally
[2145.24 - 2154.24] just canceled out as work
[2149.88 - 2157.20] sweat and just shaken
[2154.24 - 2159.40] off a man a man had to be stoic back
[2157.20 - 2163.04] then in the greatest
[2159.40 - 2166.08] sense and couldn't have a
[2163.04 - 2167.72] complaint were allowed to complain now
[2166.08 - 2170.04] you know men are allowed to complain all
[2167.72 - 2171.24] day long they're allowed to feel their
[2170.04 - 2175.44] emotions
[2171.24 - 2177.28] and contemplate and wonder who they are
[2175.44 - 2179.88] and whatever they're allowed to do that
[2177.28 - 2182.28] they weren't allowed to do that then it
[2179.88 - 2184.24] was seemed it was it was
[2182.28 - 2187.76] odd it was
[2184.24 - 2188.84] odd he had to roam with the pack survive
[2187.76 - 2192.48] in the
[2188.84 - 2196.56] world no time for complaining about any
[2192.48 - 2198.96] kind of symptom thank God women were
[2196.56 - 2201.92] bold strong and said I don't care what
[2198.96 - 2204.64] it takes I need to get my message out I
[2201.92 - 2206.56] don't care who what where knows it
[2204.64 - 2207.76] doesn't know it I need to go to the
[2206.56 - 2209.40] doctor I need to let the doctor know
[2207.76 - 2211.88] there's something going on here and
[2209.40 - 2212.88] thank God for that because it has helped
[2211.88 - 2215.76] it has
[2212.88 - 2218.72] helped but the the hormone time period
[2215.76 - 2221.12] was birthed at at that point and then
[2218.72 - 2223.40] eventually it just fell into thyroid
[2221.12 - 2225.72] later on after that and then of course
[2223.40 - 2227.68] down to thyroid and the hormone period
[2225.72 - 2231.04] it's just thyroid and the hormone period
[2227.68 - 2234.68] time now where we're just it's it's PR
[2231.04 - 2236.36] per menopause and thyroid but what is
[2234.68 - 2237.72] not understood with all the per
[2236.36 - 2239.56] menopause symptoms and menopause
[2237.72 - 2241.28] symptoms and postmenopause symptoms is
[2239.56 - 2243.84] those are all epin bar symptoms those
[2241.28 - 2245.40] are all viral symptoms and yes there's a
[2243.84 - 2247.80] thyroid problem that has occurred
[2245.40 - 2250.40] because that's a stage of when the virus
[2247.80 - 2252.72] gets from the liver to the
[2250.40 - 2255.52] thyroid the thyroid is just another
[2252.72 - 2257.44] victim in the batch of symptoms that's
[2255.52 - 2261.92] occurring the thyroid is just another
[2257.44 - 2264.84] symptom that is the big big big thing
[2261.92 - 2269.24] right there that's
[2264.84 - 2269.24] it that's the big boy right
[2270.32 - 2276.04] there and
[2272.16 - 2278.48] that that's ignored meaning research and
[2276.04 - 2279.80] science don't want you knowing that even
[2278.48 - 2282.84] if they
[2279.80 - 2287.24] knew they
[2282.84 - 2287.24] don't it's just one other
[2290.04 - 2294.76] thing it's just one other thing
[2292.12 - 2297.24] happening it's one other symptom it's
[2294.76 - 2300.28] one other part of of all of that but
[2297.24 - 2301.96] it's not the cause it's not the cause of
[2300.28 - 2303.72] the aches and pains the fatigue the
[2301.96 - 2306.36] brain fog the confusion the
[2303.72 - 2309.28] lightheadedness the vertigo the tentis
[2306.36 - 2311.80] the the uh hot flashes the mood swings
[2309.28 - 2316.56] the brittle nails the hair falling
[2311.80 - 2319.04] out it's not a part of that it's
[2316.56 - 2320.40] not and that's a big thing that's a big
[2319.04 - 2325.00] thing that's why I'm even pausing
[2320.40 - 2327.48] because it's just it it's it's
[2325.00 - 2330.16] unbelievable what's going on in in in
[2327.48 - 2332.68] the medical world right now and what's
[2330.16 - 2335.16] happening and how it's things are seen
[2332.68 - 2337.40] and understood we're still behind
[2335.16 - 2339.40] chronic illness is still behind
[2337.40 - 2341.08] look I totally love research and science
[2339.40 - 2343.72] love it love it love it it just it's
[2341.08 - 2345.64] just not there with thyroid disease and
[2343.72 - 2349.00] thyroid illness and everything about the
[2345.64 - 2349.00] thyroid it's not there
[2350.64 - 2355.28] yet
[2352.92 - 2357.24] hyperthyroid hyperthyroid is the epin
[2355.28 - 2361.72] bar going into the
[2357.24 - 2361.72] thyroid and accelerating tissue
[2361.88 - 2367.08] growth because it's attacking the
[2364.20 - 2368.80] thyroid so feverishly that the thyroid
[2367.08 - 2371.36] protects itself and develops a little
[2368.80 - 2374.52] bit more tissue this is a protection
[2371.36 - 2374.52] meth mechanism for
[2374.84 - 2381.28] you the bulging eyes for Graves and
[2378.84 - 2383.08] hyperthyroid that comes from fluid
[2381.28 - 2385.68] buildup from having the virus fluid
[2383.08 - 2388.32] build up specifically behind the
[2385.68 - 2390.16] eyes it's not the thyroid necessarily
[2388.32 - 2391.88] causing bulging eyes the thyroid problem
[2390.16 - 2394.36] itself is not causing the bulging eyes
[2391.88 - 2395.68] this is fluid buildup behind the eyes
[2394.36 - 2398.28] this is something research science
[2395.68 - 2401.16] doesn't know either yet understands that
[2398.28 - 2401.16] symptom yet
[2402.52 - 2407.40] entirely
[2404.60 - 2409.28] somebody can still gain weight with
[2407.40 - 2411.00] hyperthyroid because they'll also have
[2409.28 - 2414.44] another variety of Epstein bar which is
[2411.00 - 2414.44] the one that slows down the
[2416.40 - 2421.04] thyroid meaning that's the one that sits
[2418.76 - 2425.36] in the liver allowing the liver to get
[2421.04 - 2428.36] super super sluggish causing the weight
[2425.36 - 2428.36] gain
[2428.60 - 2433.88] so what happens is if the liver has a
[2431.72 - 2436.68] lot of viral material in it so it has
[2433.88 - 2438.12] two varieties of viruses or even three
[2436.68 - 2439.76] some people have even more they have
[2438.12 - 2441.92] different kinds of viruses but if they
[2439.76 - 2444.32] have two varieties of the Epstein
[2441.92 - 2447.88] bar the liver really gets sluggish and
[2444.32 - 2449.64] slows down so even if someone has the
[2447.88 - 2451.48] hyperthyroid virus and it's in the
[2449.64 - 2452.92] thyroid creating a little accelerating
[2451.48 - 2455.08] the tissue growth a little bit which is
[2452.92 - 2457.32] more hormone
[2455.08 - 2459.32] production they also can have the other
[2457.32 - 2460.80] Epstein bar inside the liver that's also
[2459.32 - 2462.96] inside the thyroid but it's inside the
[2460.80 - 2465.32] liver really really really slowing the
[2462.96 - 2468.00] liver
[2465.32 - 2470.16] down which then affects the
[2468.00 - 2472.00] thyroid but it's the liver being the
[2470.16 - 2473.80] problem it's the liver being the symptom
[2472.00 - 2476.40] that's the problem the liver is where
[2473.80 - 2478.28] that's at it's not the thyroid in the
[2476.40 - 2479.64] end but it's the liver that's actually
[2478.28 - 2482.00] causing that and that's a whole another
[2479.64 - 2485.40] thing the liver is causing
[2482.00 - 2487.04] literally dozens and dozens of symptoms
[2485.40 - 2491.28] because Epstein bar sitting inside the
[2487.04 - 2493.64] liver causing symptoms and causing
[2491.28 - 2495.44] problems for the thyroid and for other
[2493.64 - 2497.08] things in the body cuz the thyroid like
[2495.44 - 2499.16] I said is just this other victim it's
[2497.08 - 2503.92] just this other thing that's happening
[2499.16 - 2503.92] it's another part of what's being
[2506.16 - 2510.52] problematic and when somebody gets a
[2508.12 - 2512.88] thyroid killed off there's still thyroid
[2510.52 - 2514.84] tissue working and there's still thyroid
[2512.88 - 2517.12] working and when someone gets their
[2514.84 - 2519.00] thyroid removed you'll and you'll read
[2517.12 - 2521.08] about that how that works someone gets
[2519.00 - 2523.20] their thyroid
[2521.08 - 2526.56] removed there's still thyroid tissue
[2523.20 - 2528.80] always left producing
[2526.56 - 2532.36] hormone but what
[2528.80 - 2534.20] hormone is the most important hormone
[2532.36 - 2536.84] you're thinking T4
[2534.20 - 2539.24] T3 no they're the least important
[2536.84 - 2542.40] hormones there's two undiscovered
[2539.24 - 2545.52] hormones that you're going to read
[2542.40 - 2547.48] about that are really important to
[2545.52 - 2549.04] thyroid
[2547.48 - 2551.84] healing
[2549.04 - 2553.80] now um so let's go into a couple of
[2551.84 - 2556.72] other things here let's go into a couple
[2553.80 - 2559.28] other things that we need to go
[2556.72 - 2561.44] into we're going to talk about the role
[2559.28 - 2563.40] of the thyroid a little bit this is fun
[2561.44 - 2565.92] this is fun we're going to talk about
[2563.40 - 2570.68] the role of the
[2565.92 - 2572.12] thyroid now the thyroid its function is
[2570.68 - 2574.32] a lot different than we think we think
[2572.12 - 2577.92] it's the metabolism function we think
[2574.32 - 2581.20] it's just for controlling weight it's
[2577.92 - 2584.16] it's we think we we don't science
[2581.20 - 2587.00] research believes that the thyroid does
[2584.16 - 2589.88] a whole bunch of the T4 D T3 means
[2587.00 - 2591.48] everything meaning it basically sustains
[2589.88 - 2594.48] our
[2591.48 - 2597.00] life and it's these the ultimate
[2594.48 - 2598.80] metabolism hormones too keeping weight
[2597.00 - 2601.00] off and everything like that and by the
[2598.80 - 2602.96] way that's just not true there are so
[2601.00 - 2606.52] many women that have either normal
[2602.96 - 2608.24] numbers or they have or they have um
[2606.52 - 2609.76] hormone replacement they have the
[2608.24 - 2611.20] thyroid medications and they're still
[2609.76 - 2613.20] gaining weight like crazy because like I
[2611.20 - 2615.72] said before it's the liver and it's the
[2613.20 - 2617.36] virus inside the liver that does that
[2615.72 - 2619.40] just like when someone has two viruses
[2617.36 - 2621.76] like I said with hyperthyroid that's why
[2619.40 - 2623.68] hyperthyroid people they they tend to
[2621.76 - 2625.20] gain weight too and just so you know
[2623.68 - 2627.32] people with
[2625.20 - 2629.56] hyperthyroid there's more people with
[2627.32 - 2631.64] hyperthyroid gaining weight meaning
[2629.56 - 2633.88] overweight hyper thyroids than there are
[2631.64 - 2636.64] people underweight
[2633.88 - 2638.56] hyperthyroid very important to know very
[2636.64 - 2641.04] important to
[2638.56 - 2644.16] know that that's a critical critical
[2641.04 - 2646.16] point to know by the way but boy they'll
[2644.16 - 2647.72] make it out like different they'll
[2646.16 - 2649.48] completely make it out different to try
[2647.72 - 2651.56] to prove a point that they have a theory
[2649.48 - 2653.96] that they have so they'll make it seem
[2651.56 - 2655.96] like no no no then you're you're the
[2653.96 - 2657.92] only one that's gaining weight with
[2655.96 - 2660.40] hyperthyroid that's how they'll act and
[2657.92 - 2662.92] be it's unbelievable research of science
[2660.40 - 2664.48] will they'll just you're the only one
[2662.92 - 2665.64] everybody else they're all losing weight
[2664.48 - 2667.68] they can't keep their weight on with
[2665.64 - 2669.16] hyper thyroid and you're the only one
[2667.68 - 2671.44] gaining weight with hyperthyroid you're
[2669.16 - 2673.96] just an anomaly oh okay just here's your
[2671.44 - 2677.84] medication see you off on your
[2673.96 - 2680.20] way no no no no there's more people much
[2677.84 - 2681.76] more it's like 70% of people with
[2680.20 - 2683.48] hyperthyroid are gaining weight and
[2681.76 - 2686.44] they're overweight and they're dealing
[2683.48 - 2689.72] with weight issues 30% are either normal
[2686.44 - 2693.28] with their weight or losing
[2689.72 - 2695.08] weight and that's even that's even not
[2693.28 - 2697.76] even right meaning in the sense that
[2695.08 - 2702.20] that 30%
[2697.76 - 2703.72] um 30% is complicated it's complicated
[2702.20 - 2706.08] it means people still stay the same
[2703.72 - 2708.24] weight most of that 30% and then they
[2706.08 - 2710.88] gain weight later is what I mean they
[2708.24 - 2712.08] gain weight later so it all depends on
[2710.88 - 2713.44] where the person is in their time
[2712.08 - 2715.72] someone could have hyperthyroid when
[2713.44 - 2717.40] they're 30 and have their weight stable
[2715.72 - 2721.44] or even lose a little but for some
[2717.40 - 2724.20] reason here they are later on gaining
[2721.44 - 2726.16] weight and and before any kind of iodine
[2724.20 - 2729.16] treatment radioactive iodine or any kind
[2726.16 - 2731.16] of kill off or anything else like that
[2729.16 - 2732.48] or any removal of thyroid or anything
[2731.16 - 2734.48] like that and then they're gaining
[2732.48 - 2736.80] weight before any of that even happens
[2734.48 - 2738.48] that's another thing none of this is
[2736.80 - 2740.60] they don't document all this all the
[2738.48 - 2744.88] different variables and what
[2740.60 - 2746.44] happens so in essence most hyperthyroid
[2744.88 - 2747.76] people don't have a weight loss problem
[2746.44 - 2750.60] they have a weight gaining problem one
[2747.76 - 2750.60] time or another
[2751.76 - 2756.28] eventually
[2753.48 - 2758.52] because the amount of thyroid having the
[2756.28 - 2760.48] other thyroid virus I was talking about
[2758.52 - 2763.04] the other Epstein bar not the one that
[2760.48 - 2764.28] accelerates uh hormones and tissue
[2763.04 - 2765.96] growth in the thyroid that you'll read
[2764.28 - 2768.12] about with hyperthyroid but the other
[2765.96 - 2770.56] one that slows down the liver which
[2768.12 - 2772.16] slows down everything the other one
[2770.56 - 2774.28] sitting in the thyroid and that slows
[2772.16 - 2775.80] down the
[2774.28 - 2779.84] liver
[2775.80 - 2783.04] so um so let's go into what the thyroid
[2779.84 - 2785.60] does what does it really
[2783.04 - 2787.40] do what does a thyroid really do I mean
[2785.60 - 2789.88] that that's another thing too well first
[2787.40 - 2793.24] of all it's like the second
[2789.88 - 2796.92] brain it's your body's data
[2793.24 - 2801.08] center it's not the metabolism
[2796.92 - 2804.72] manager that everybody wants it to
[2801.08 - 2808.04] be it cataloges everything it's it marks
[2804.72 - 2808.04] everything it cataloges
[2808.96 - 2813.12] everything its goal is to create
[2811.28 - 2815.52] homeostasis throughout the body but
[2813.12 - 2817.60] homeostasis throughout the body balance
[2815.52 - 2819.36] throughout the body it's the complaint
[2817.60 - 2822.20] center and you'll even read about that
[2819.36 - 2824.04] the this is really funny the complaint
[2822.20 - 2826.36] center that's where every organ every
[2824.04 - 2828.56] gland in the whole body can send out a
[2826.36 - 2830.76] complaint to the
[2828.56 - 2833.56] thyroid but what's it sending out a
[2830.76 - 2836.92] complaint for so that T4 and T3 can do
[2833.56 - 2840.08] anything no no no no it's not sending
[2836.92 - 2842.32] out a complaint so that T4 and T3 can
[2840.08 - 2844.48] save the world within the body that's
[2842.32 - 2848.24] what I'm trying to
[2844.48 - 2849.68] say it's not doing that these other two
[2848.24 - 2851.12] hormones that are undiscovered by
[2849.68 - 2854.12] research and
[2851.12 - 2854.12] science
[2854.48 - 2858.44] okay these other two hormones that
[2856.88 - 2862.04] you're going to read
[2858.44 - 2864.48] about they are radio frequency
[2862.04 - 2866.56] hormones because research and science
[2864.48 - 2868.80] only looks for one kind of
[2866.56 - 2871.08] hormone a special chemical that
[2868.80 - 2873.64] determines if it's a hormone or not
[2871.08 - 2876.60] meaning a a different kind of there's
[2873.64 - 2880.04] different kinds of hormones
[2876.60 - 2882.88] some that aren't just the the blatant
[2880.04 - 2883.80] steroid variety what I'm saying is the
[2882.88 - 2886.48] only
[2883.80 - 2890.04] hormone the only hormone variety
[2886.48 - 2891.68] research and science has documented so
[2890.04 - 2894.56] they know what they're looking for is a
[2891.68 - 2896.64] steroidal based hormone that means we
[2894.56 - 2898.92] have all these different hormones in the
[2896.64 - 2901.52] body all these different hormones but
[2898.92 - 2903.48] they all have a steroid touch to it they
[2901.52 - 2905.32] all have an identification of steroid
[2903.48 - 2908.04] but there's this whole group of hormones
[2905.32 - 2910.28] in the body in general in all kinds of
[2908.04 - 2912.20] places that I'm going to have to get
[2910.28 - 2914.08] information from Spirit along the way my
[2912.20 - 2915.36] source and get it to you but there's a
[2914.08 - 2918.16] whole bunch of different kinds of
[2915.36 - 2921.72] hormones that aren't steroid
[2918.16 - 2925.00] based so they're not identified in the
[2921.72 - 2927.32] lab because the lab is only literally
[2925.00 - 2930.04] programmed with data to find a
[2927.32 - 2930.04] steroid-based
[2930.32 - 2934.68] hormone these hormones are radio
[2932.44 - 2937.12] frequency hormones cu the body is way
[2934.68 - 2939.52] more complicated than anybody knows than
[2937.12 - 2942.64] research and science has ever discovered
[2939.52 - 2942.64] radio frequency
[2944.12 - 2948.52] hormones they're not a steroid compound
[2947.08 - 2951.08] attached to
[2948.52 - 2952.36] it there's there's no chemical compounds
[2951.08 - 2955.60] in the steroid Department that are
[2952.36 - 2957.76] really Affiliated or understood with the
[2955.60 - 2960.20] radio frequency
[2957.76 - 2962.36] hormone and the radio frequency hormone
[2960.20 - 2964.56] has chemical compounds but they're not
[2962.36 - 2967.24] going to be understood as the regular
[2964.56 - 2968.72] steroid the regular steroid that
[2967.24 - 2971.20] everybody knows about which is
[2968.72 - 2973.04] everything T4 T3 which is progesterone
[2971.20 - 2974.24] and and estrogen which is testosterone
[2973.04 - 2975.96] which is all the different hormones
[2974.24 - 2978.88] which is you know all of that the sex
[2975.96 - 2981.60] hormones all of that they are steroids
[2978.88 - 2984.36] the adrenaline hormon
[2981.60 - 2986.40] steroids
[2984.36 - 2988.44] steroids well that's what they are so
[2986.40 - 2990.44] they're identified like that in the labs
[2988.44 - 2992.20] but radio frequency hormones are not
[2990.44 - 2996.04] discovered
[2992.20 - 2999.16] yet and the thyroid has two of them that
[2996.04 - 3002.00] play a bigger role in our thyroid health
[2999.16 - 3005.68] and our body's physical health than than
[3002.00 - 3005.68] no one even can imagine
[3005.88 - 3010.76] yet and so these frequencies get
[3009.24 - 3012.52] delivered to different parts of the body
[3010.76 - 3014.12] to keep it balanced delivered to the
[3012.52 - 3015.84] liver delivered to the pancreas
[3014.12 - 3019.84] delivered to other glands and
[3015.84 - 3022.84] organs and that's the powerful real
[3019.84 - 3026.72] role of the
[3022.84 - 3030.00] thyroid so if the thyroid gets d
[3026.72 - 3032.40] damaged if the thyroid gets
[3030.00 - 3033.60] hurt if the thyroid gets injured by
[3032.40 - 3035.96] Epstein
[3033.60 - 3037.56] bar the thyroid is still going to send
[3035.96 - 3040.84] out those radio
[3037.56 - 3042.28] frequencies cuz radio frequencies are
[3040.84 - 3043.40] powerful in the thyroid to the point
[3042.28 - 3044.64] where you only need a little bit of
[3043.40 - 3046.24] thyroid tissue left you're still going
[3044.64 - 3049.72] to have a lot of radio frequency coming
[3046.24 - 3051.36] out of those little pockets of tissue
[3049.72 - 3053.88] even if your thyroid scarred and damaged
[3051.36 - 3053.88] and everything
[3054.44 - 3058.48] else
[3056.48 - 3060.24] and the liver stores a tremendous amount
[3058.48 - 3062.16] of interesting chemical compounds that
[3060.24 - 3065.72] help out the thyroid when a thyroid
[3062.16 - 3068.96] calls out for radio with the radio
[3065.72 - 3072.04] frequencies and the adrenals
[3068.96 - 3074.56] overcompensate as well the adren
[3072.04 - 3078.56] adrenals can even mimic T4
[3074.56 - 3080.92] T3 in its own way can do all kinds of
[3078.56 - 3083.84] things for us to give us to give us
[3080.92 - 3086.92] backup hormones the thyroid works with
[3083.84 - 3090.52] every organ and every gland and this is
[3086.92 - 3094.16] a big deal and this right here we're not
[3090.52 - 3096.88] there yet as far as research and science
[3094.16 - 3100.20] T4 T3 play a role in our health but a
[3096.88 - 3102.16] small one T4 T3 really just helped the
[3100.20 - 3104.48] immune system stay balanced which is
[3102.16 - 3106.16] important don't get me wrong it is
[3104.48 - 3108.56] important but other things keep the
[3106.16 - 3112.32] immune system balanced too other thing
[3108.56 - 3112.32] other things in the body keep it
[3113.24 - 3119.72] balanced and so
[3115.88 - 3124.00] T T4 T3 help with temperature
[3119.72 - 3127.04] controls so you don't feel cold in the
[3124.00 - 3130.20] morning or you don't feel kind of like
[3127.04 - 3130.20] there's a little bit temperature
[3130.64 - 3138.68] off but that's pretty much
[3134.44 - 3141.24] it your thyroid sends a 911 call out to
[3138.68 - 3145.12] the liver for backup for storage of T4
[3141.24 - 3147.88] and T3 if your thyroid needs it it sends
[3145.12 - 3150.16] an 911 call through a radio frequency
[3147.88 - 3152.84] hormone the Undiscovered radio frequency
[3150.16 - 3157.48] hormones to the liver to
[3152.84 - 3159.68] get the liver to convert some T4 to T3
[3157.48 - 3163.36] and also to get some T3 to begin with
[3159.68 - 3165.88] and T4 going out of the liver if
[3163.36 - 3167.44] needed that's the power of the thyroid
[3165.88 - 3171.08] that's one of its
[3167.44 - 3174.44] roles and it can do that even if it's
[3171.08 - 3176.96] injured even if epine bar has invaded
[3174.44 - 3179.80] the thyroid
[3176.96 - 3183.36] the adrenals can create T4 and
[3179.80 - 3186.88] T3 and even a little bit of radio
[3183.36 - 3189.76] frequency R5 and R
[3186.88 - 3192.36] six has
[3189.76 - 3195.12] backup so this is important
[3192.36 - 3197.00] information okay let's take a sip I'm I
[3195.12 - 3201.16] am I I don't know you guys but I'm going
[3197.00 - 3201.16] to take a sip here of some tea bear with
[3202.16 - 3209.68] me that's a mix of peppermint and lemon
[3206.28 - 3213.72] Bal it's very good very
[3209.68 - 3215.84] good okay so um let's go into symptoms
[3213.72 - 3218.28] let's talk about symptoms a little bit
[3215.84 - 3223.20] let's do that that that's kind of
[3218.28 - 3226.32] fun um weight gain liver the liver
[3223.20 - 3227.92] causes weight gain um the liver becomes
[3226.32 - 3231.12] toxic over the
[3227.92 - 3232.88] years um uh builds up little fatty
[3231.12 - 3236.64] deposits even if it's not diagnosed as a
[3232.88 - 3239.28] fatty liver yet and and that's the very
[3236.64 - 3244.64] basis behind weight
[3239.28 - 3247.52] gain mostly the basis basis behind
[3244.64 - 3249.60] it metabolism
[3247.52 - 3252.12] metabolism that's really just the liver
[3249.60 - 3253.92] once again um make sure you read the
[3252.12 - 3256.00] metabolism
[3253.92 - 3259.12] chapter whatever you
[3256.00 - 3261.76] do you can't forget about the metabolism
[3259.12 - 3266.44] chapter so make sure you you look into
[3261.76 - 3269.40] that one um hair loss
[3266.44 - 3270.96] hair loss that's adrenals that's that's
[3269.40 - 3272.64] that's cortisol that's adrenals that's
[3270.96 - 3274.40] adrenals being in you can be under
[3272.64 - 3276.60] stress for three four years five years
[3274.40 - 3278.88] in your life you could be drinking
[3276.60 - 3280.16] coffee being stressed out um not taking
[3278.88 - 3282.16] care of yourself getting really
[3280.16 - 3284.52] deficient but the adrenals play the
[3282.16 - 3287.04] largest role in hair loss hair thinning
[3284.52 - 3289.60] not the thyroid the adrenals
[3287.04 - 3293.32] do and you can read more about it you
[3289.60 - 3295.40] know more kind of cleaner version in the
[3293.32 - 3297.72] book I'm glazing over it right right now
[3295.40 - 3298.84] meaning that symptoms hair texture
[3297.72 - 3300.76] that's straight
[3298.84 - 3302.28] deficiencies that's one of the things
[3300.76 - 3304.96] straight
[3302.28 - 3307.44] deficiencies
[3304.96 - 3309.48] insomnia insomnia is a neurotransmitter
[3307.44 - 3311.64] problem usually Epstein bar and Epstein
[3309.48 - 3314.52] bar creates deficiencies just eats away
[3311.64 - 3318.08] at at our um vitamin storage
[3314.52 - 3320.16] bin slows down the liver um all that
[3318.08 - 3321.92] stuff so we we get less vitamins less
[3320.16 - 3324.64] conversion with vitamins less
[3321.92 - 3326.64] methylation that's all that's that all H
[3324.64 - 3329.64] happens with um Epstein bar inside the
[3326.64 - 3331.72] liver insomnia neurotransmitters due to
[3329.64 - 3333.40] neurotoxins you can read and you can see
[3331.72 - 3336.20] neurotoxins that do a really good
[3333.40 - 3337.88] explanation in there of neurotoxins
[3336.20 - 3341.40] dermatoxin
[3337.88 - 3344.96] byproduct so make sure you get into that
[3341.40 - 3347.56] sometime brain fog concentration
[3344.96 - 3349.68] neurotoxins once again floating in the
[3347.56 - 3352.92] bloodstream coming from the liver coming
[3349.68 - 3354.76] from an Epstein bar floating around um
[3352.92 - 3356.92] toxic heavy metals also either in the
[3354.76 - 3360.56] brain brain that are also oxidizing but
[3356.92 - 3363.08] feeding viruses causing neurotoxins to
[3360.56 - 3365.12] cause more brain fog more confusion more
[3363.08 - 3367.52] concentration that's not a thyroid
[3365.12 - 3369.24] problem that is not a thyroid symptom so
[3367.52 - 3370.84] I'm comforting some of these symptoms so
[3369.24 - 3374.40] you know what's not a thyroid symptom
[3370.84 - 3376.52] too chills that's not a thyroid problem
[3374.40 - 3378.44] that's a viral problem someone coming
[3376.52 - 3380.32] down with Hashimoto with serious serious
[3378.44 - 3383.24] fatigue and chills it's blamed on the
[3380.32 - 3385.68] Hashimoto no it's not the thyroid
[3383.24 - 3388.56] causing problems because the virus is in
[3385.68 - 3391.20] the thyroid it's the virus in general in
[3388.56 - 3393.88] the body causing the problems causing
[3391.20 - 3395.84] the chills causing the fevers causing
[3393.88 - 3397.68] the fatigue causing the neurological
[3395.84 - 3400.80] fatigue that's the Epstein bar that's
[3397.68 - 3403.32] the chronic fatigue syndrome Epstein
[3400.80 - 3405.68] bar what science and research is good at
[3403.32 - 3407.28] though is renaming things they've
[3405.68 - 3409.72] already named chronic fatigue syndrome
[3407.28 - 3411.20] you know five times I don't know what it
[3409.72 - 3413.88] is now they'll probably name it another
[3411.20 - 3415.52] five times just to keep us
[3413.88 - 3418.80] distracted
[3415.52 - 3422.00] um cold hands and
[3418.80 - 3424.12] feet cold hands and feet is liver
[3422.00 - 3427.04] circulation because of the liver and a
[3424.12 - 3430.24] lot of toxins in the liver namely many
[3427.04 - 3432.36] could be viral puffy face puffy eyes
[3430.24 - 3433.96] lymphatic system and liver once again
[3432.36 - 3437.52] liver being clogged
[3433.96 - 3439.52] up and that's edema that's a mild edema
[3437.52 - 3441.12] and then regular edema if a doctor can't
[3439.52 - 3443.84] find kidney problems or heart problems
[3441.12 - 3445.36] which which is which is easy to find
[3443.84 - 3446.44] with what we have in research science
[3445.36 - 3448.04] thank God and that's what I love about
[3446.44 - 3450.20] research of science is they have so much
[3448.04 - 3453.44] that is helpful that I do love in so
[3450.20 - 3455.64] many ways and surgeons I love surgeons I
[3453.44 - 3457.60] love everybody committed to bettering
[3455.64 - 3458.92] people's lives and we have so many great
[3457.60 - 3460.16] things and I've talked about that over
[3458.92 - 3462.80] and over again you guys don't need to
[3460.16 - 3465.96] hear that again from me you know I'm Pro
[3462.80 - 3468.24] I'm Pro uh Pro doctor Pro surgeons Pro
[3465.96 - 3471.56] Specialists Pro experts too you know
[3468.24 - 3473.28] even know I I say what I say about you
[3471.56 - 3474.88] know in the thyroid World in other world
[3473.28 - 3478.56] it's just a chronic illness is falling
[3474.88 - 3480.52] short so I do I do say that everybody is
[3478.56 - 3483.28] kind of behind the times in that area of
[3480.52 - 3484.72] course that that that I stand by been
[3483.28 - 3488.48] chronic illness is where it's all
[3484.72 - 3490.40] falling through um and has been for
[3488.48 - 3492.28] decades and decades so the puffy face
[3490.40 - 3494.76] puffy eyes that's liver lymphatic
[3492.28 - 3497.52] sluggish liver problematic
[3494.76 - 3499.84] liver so these are just some of the
[3497.52 - 3502.52] symptoms um and you can see other
[3499.84 - 3505.68] symptoms too that are that are in there
[3502.52 - 3506.92] that are you know of what's going on
[3505.68 - 3508.12] that's a that's another thing now
[3506.92 - 3510.44] medication I want to talk about
[3508.12 - 3513.96] medication a little bit of medic
[3510.44 - 3516.04] medication is is a funny thing um you
[3513.96 - 3518.24] know talk to your doctor with any of
[3516.04 - 3520.12] that um you know your practitioner
[3518.24 - 3521.88] whatever if you want to play with your
[3520.12 - 3523.28] medications you know a lot of doctors
[3521.88 - 3524.84] these days are definitely open to
[3523.28 - 3526.80] playing with medications they're open to
[3524.84 - 3528.60] reducing them in case you're getting a
[3526.80 - 3532.52] side effect from a medication they're
[3528.60 - 3534.32] open to uh changing them sometimes too
[3532.52 - 3536.12] um so they're they're they're they're
[3534.32 - 3537.44] open to to a lot of different things
[3536.12 - 3539.64] some you know I've seen a lot of great
[3537.44 - 3541.04] doctors where they learn about Epstein
[3539.64 - 3542.60] bar they learn about the thyroid they
[3541.04 - 3544.80] see their patient getting better doing
[3542.60 - 3546.12] anti-in bar protocols I've seen this
[3544.80 - 3547.68] because they're doing stuff out of say
[3546.12 - 3550.68] the medical medium book or
[3547.68 - 3553.12] something and um and the doctor
[3550.68 - 3556.84] minimizes the medication for them along
[3553.12 - 3557.84] the way they feel better um and so
[3556.84 - 3559.20] there's a lot of different things you
[3557.84 - 3560.84] can do with medication but one thing
[3559.20 - 3563.16] about thyroid medication it does make
[3560.84 - 3565.00] the liver sluggish so if someone goes on
[3563.16 - 3568.32] thyroid medication because they have a
[3565.00 - 3569.68] hypothyroid say in their 30s or in their
[3568.32 - 3570.92] they're in their 20s so if if you've
[3569.68 - 3574.24] ever experienced that if you know
[3570.92 - 3577.52] somebody or maybe it's you going through
[3574.24 - 3579.28] it what happens is that if you're on
[3577.52 - 3581.60] that medication for 20 years you're just
[3579.28 - 3583.08] given that medication for Life what
[3581.60 - 3584.52] happens is the medication ends up
[3583.08 - 3586.96] slowing down the liver clogging up
[3584.52 - 3588.68] causing weight gain sometimes it's not
[3586.96 - 3592.36] even the upstein bar somebody's life is
[3588.68 - 3596.36] going good where they're not triggering
[3592.36 - 3597.84] so easily their Epstein bar
[3596.36 - 3599.60] and you know there's not a lot of
[3597.84 - 3602.40] terrible things happening or stressful
[3599.60 - 3606.20] things or changes in their life like big
[3602.40 - 3607.80] breakups and heartbreak and divorces and
[3606.20 - 3609.96] um things that we go through in life
[3607.80 - 3611.72] that everybody goes through in life you
[3609.96 - 3613.40] know all the normal things that cause
[3611.72 - 3615.68] stress Financial stress everything else
[3613.40 - 3619.00] the triggers the triggers and you'll see
[3615.68 - 3622.24] the trigger section there so if you're
[3619.00 - 3623.28] not going through a lot of triggers if
[3622.24 - 3625.36] you're not someone that's going through
[3623.28 - 3627.00] a lot of triggers things could all be
[3625.36 - 3630.60] going smooth you got this very mild
[3627.00 - 3632.72] hypothyroid because the mono you had
[3630.60 - 3634.40] that you may not even know you had
[3632.72 - 3635.64] really mild it could be like I talk
[3634.40 - 3638.40] about a medical
[3635.64 - 3640.04] medium that could just literally be
[3638.40 - 3641.96] giving you you know the exposure of a
[3640.04 - 3643.52] very mild epine bar in the liver it's
[3641.96 - 3645.36] not doing much then it goes to the
[3643.52 - 3648.16] thyroid causing the hypothyroid in your
[3645.36 - 3649.80] 20s or 30s it's not doing much it just
[3648.16 - 3651.16] sits in there it's not doing much and
[3649.80 - 3655.76] you don't have a lot of triggers things
[3651.16 - 3659.40] are going smooth life is going great
[3655.76 - 3662.16] and next thing you know it though the
[3659.40 - 3663.56] medications end up clogging up the liver
[3662.16 - 3665.40] over time by the time you're get into
[3663.56 - 3667.16] your 40s you're noticing weight gain you
[3665.40 - 3669.88] can't control and then that gets thrown
[3667.16 - 3671.56] into hey you need estrogen testosterone
[3669.88 - 3673.32] you need all everything rebalanced you
[3671.56 - 3676.32] need progesterone you need all your you
[3673.32 - 3677.92] need all your hormones looked at because
[3676.32 - 3679.36] then the hormone thing gets thrown into
[3677.92 - 3681.12] but really what's happening is you got
[3679.36 - 3682.40] this liver problem from old Epstein bar
[3681.12 - 3683.84] sitting in there so long and you got all
[3682.40 - 3685.52] the medications built up from your
[3683.84 - 3687.48] thyroid medication and that happens to
[3685.52 - 3689.36] millions of women where things are kind
[3687.48 - 3692.72] of going smooth they're not getting too
[3689.36 - 3694.68] many triggers too many upsets in life um
[3692.72 - 3697.08] and uh just maybe some of the basic
[3694.68 - 3698.88] upsets or basic triggers and you know
[3697.08 - 3701.76] the upstein bar hasn't really Advanced
[3698.88 - 3703.84] too far causing too many symptoms and
[3701.76 - 3705.52] then the thyroid medication builds up
[3703.84 - 3707.36] and builds up and builds up in the liver
[3705.52 - 3708.88] from 20 years of thyroid medication
[3707.36 - 3710.60] which is bottles after bottles of
[3708.88 - 3713.24] thyroid medication being stored inside
[3710.60 - 3714.80] the liver and then finally weight gain
[3713.24 - 3716.48] comes on then it's blamed on hormones
[3714.80 - 3719.60] it's blamed on per menopause it's blamed
[3716.48 - 3721.00] on menopause and if then if they get any
[3719.60 - 3722.60] kind of triggers at that point in your
[3721.00 - 3724.36] life so if you get a trigger in that
[3722.60 - 3725.68] point in your life now it's years later
[3724.36 - 3727.76] you're in your 40s you're in your early
[3725.68 - 3729.72] 50s and you're getting triggers now
[3727.76 - 3731.40] something happens divorce stress or any
[3729.72 - 3734.20] kind of other you know or any kind of
[3731.40 - 3736.52] thing trauma or anything well then the
[3734.20 - 3740.00] virus can amp up a bit causing other
[3736.52 - 3741.72] symptoms fatigue brain fog other things
[3740.00 - 3743.40] and when that happens then the doctor
[3741.72 - 3744.92] say well definitely menopause per
[3743.40 - 3746.36] menopause symptoms and this was the
[3744.92 - 3749.48] mistake made in
[3746.36 - 3752.60] 1950 this was the mistake made in
[3749.48 - 3755.16] 1950 and I talk about it here in thyroid
[3752.60 - 3757.76] healing but I thought I would you know
[3755.16 - 3760.76] talk about it a little bit also in this
[3757.76 - 3760.76] webinar
[3760.96 - 3767.04] um so uh so
[3764.84 - 3769.88] basically we don't want to build up that
[3767.04 - 3772.12] much medication in the liver either over
[3769.88 - 3773.72] time so we do want to play with
[3772.12 - 3776.04] medication if we can I mean if you're do
[3773.72 - 3777.44] meaning if you're doctor's open to it
[3776.04 - 3780.40] you can talk to your doctor and see if
[3777.44 - 3783.36] he's open to it and you do the protocols
[3780.40 - 3786.32] that um that Spirit KN have outlined in
[3783.36 - 3787.80] the book for knocking down Epstein bar
[3786.32 - 3789.56] and what's happening is with these
[3787.80 - 3791.68] protocols inside the book it's about
[3789.56 - 3795.12] knocking down Epstein
[3791.68 - 3797.08] bar that's what it is and that's that's
[3795.12 - 3798.68] the key and it's some some of the
[3797.08 - 3801.08] supplements too are to revive the
[3798.68 - 3802.72] thyroid from Epstein bar damage because
[3801.08 - 3804.64] we want to protect the thyroid so it can
[3802.72 - 3807.32] keep strong and keep our radio active
[3804.64 - 3811.76] frequencies and everything else going on
[3807.32 - 3813.28] but it's about the foods not to eat you
[3811.76 - 3815.92] know you do the best you can you take
[3813.28 - 3818.28] one thing at a time try not to get
[3815.92 - 3820.52] overwhelmed and you do the best you can
[3818.28 - 3822.72] you take out some of the foods that feed
[3820.52 - 3824.52] the virus that you can back down and
[3822.72 - 3826.12] that's what happens with a lot of also
[3824.52 - 3827.56] you know diets out there is they take
[3826.12 - 3829.28] away some of the foods or a lot of the
[3827.56 - 3830.56] foods that do feed Epstein bar but they
[3829.28 - 3833.04] don't know that that's what they're
[3830.56 - 3835.40] doing and then they call it the thyroid
[3833.04 - 3837.80] fix but really what's
[3835.40 - 3840.44] happening when they do get results they
[3837.80 - 3842.84] don't know why they have the wrong
[3840.44 - 3845.40] reasons of why they're getting
[3842.84 - 3847.80] results it which is fine as long as
[3845.40 - 3849.32] someone's getting results but you need
[3847.80 - 3850.72] to know why you're getting results you
[3849.32 - 3852.32] can keep on it stay on it so it's
[3850.72 - 3853.76] nothing creeps up and comes back 10
[3852.32 - 3855.56] years down the road 5 years down the
[3853.76 - 3858.24] road or something else happens you want
[3855.56 - 3859.92] to really get rid of the epsteen bar and
[3858.24 - 3862.20] clean it up you really want to revive
[3859.92 - 3863.96] your thyroid but you want to know why
[3862.20 - 3866.92] and how and that's that's what we're
[3863.96 - 3869.36] trying to do in thyroid healing so that
[3866.92 - 3871.40] once you take out those foods that feed
[3869.36 - 3873.76] the virus and and and cause the virus to
[3871.40 - 3875.72] cause more symptoms and whatnot once you
[3873.76 - 3877.88] you know you're using take out the foods
[3875.72 - 3879.72] that don't help and you're using foods
[3877.88 - 3881.24] that do help revive the thyroid you're
[3879.72 - 3884.32] using foods that do help knock down
[3881.24 - 3885.72] Epstein bar then you're moving forward
[3884.32 - 3886.84] but you know why you're moving forward
[3885.72 - 3888.08] you know what you're after you know what
[3886.84 - 3889.72] you're doing and you know why you have
[3888.08 - 3891.80] the auto antibodies and you know why
[3889.72 - 3894.44] things are going on that matters so you
[3891.80 - 3895.44] don't pop off course one day on a
[3894.44 - 3897.88] different
[3895.44 - 3899.00] Trend or you're on the same Trend and
[3897.88 - 3900.48] you're but now you're not getting
[3899.00 - 3902.20] results and you don't know why a year
[3900.48 - 3904.36] later that's because it wasn't really
[3902.20 - 3906.44] specifically for what the real knowledge
[3904.36 - 3908.48] is which is about knocking down Epstein
[3906.44 - 3910.48] bar which is about knocking down the
[3908.48 - 3914.04] viral load it's viral the Epstein bar is
[3910.48 - 3915.44] not a trigger and that's what happened
[3914.04 - 3918.12] that's what happened if you read a note
[3915.44 - 3920.72] for you at the beginning of the book
[3918.12 - 3922.76] read that note you don't have to read it
[3920.72 - 3925.64] now but you know or anytime but when you
[3922.76 - 3928.68] get a chance read that note that the
[3925.64 - 3933.20] note for you I I wrote that note for
[3928.68 - 3935.36] you and in that note it's important to
[3933.20 - 3938.28] understand um some of the things that I
[3935.36 - 3939.40] I put in there because it it it'll help
[3938.28 - 3942.52] it'll
[3939.40 - 3945.08] help it's because what happens is
[3942.52 - 3946.96] that the information for instance like
[3945.08 - 3948.20] book one getting Epstein bar out there
[3946.96 - 3950.16] about how it got into the thyroid they
[3948.20 - 3951.88] got a lot of people upset out there they
[3950.16 - 3954.08] got a lot of professionals upset so what
[3951.88 - 3956.20] happened was they started using the
[3954.08 - 3958.08] abene bar thing you know but they're
[3956.20 - 3960.32] using it as a they're putting it in the
[3958.08 - 3962.16] trigger basket which is the wrong place
[3960.32 - 3964.36] they're putting it in a trigger basket
[3962.16 - 3966.52] it's not a trigger it's not a trigger
[3964.36 - 3970.52] it's the cause of Hashimoto it's the
[3966.52 - 3973.12] cause it's the th it's the cause of
[3970.52 - 3976.08] hashimotos it's the cause of Hashimoto
[3973.12 - 3978.12] symptoms it's the cause of hypothyroid
[3976.08 - 3980.32] it's the cause of
[3978.12 - 3983.16] hyperthyroid it's the cause of thyroid
[3980.32 - 3985.00] cancer it's the cause so um it's
[3983.16 - 3986.92] important to know that
[3985.00 - 3988.28] and and being you know back they're just
[3986.92 - 3990.40] you know when they're trying to protect
[3988.28 - 3992.16] themselves and they're taking our
[3990.40 - 3993.68] knowledge here and then kind of
[3992.16 - 3995.24] manipulating it so it works in their
[3993.68 - 3997.60] favor but doesn't work in your favor
[3995.24 - 4000.04] entirely that's just that's that's how
[3997.60 - 4003.28] things get messed up and screwed around
[4000.04 - 4006.24] with or skewed around with that's how
[4003.28 - 4009.60] that you know that's how that
[4006.24 - 4011.36] happens and um and so just keep an open
[4009.60 - 4013.28] mind when you read a note for you so you
[4011.36 - 4015.00] can kind of say that's why he's saying
[4013.28 - 4015.92] all this it's part of why he's saying
[4015.00 - 4018.48] all
[4015.92 - 4022.60] this so that's a really
[4018.48 - 4024.96] important important fact
[4022.60 - 4027.16] so the deal is with the supplement
[4024.96 - 4029.52] section look supplements are always
[4027.16 - 4032.28] overwhelming take it one day at a time
[4029.52 - 4034.40] the supplements there are geared to
[4032.28 - 4036.48] killing off Epstein bar they're geared
[4034.40 - 4038.44] to helping the nervous system recover
[4036.48 - 4041.92] from Epstein bar symptoms they're geared
[4038.44 - 4045.56] with they're geared to helping you know
[4041.92 - 4047.32] heal damaged tissue in the thyroid take
[4045.56 - 4049.04] it one day at a time I you could work
[4047.32 - 4051.84] with your practitioner and healer and
[4049.04 - 4054.04] doctor and friend whoever you have you
[4051.84 - 4056.72] know you can work with them on the
[4054.04 - 4058.08] supplements you can take one at a time
[4056.72 - 4059.76] if you're afraid of supplements
[4058.08 - 4061.04] altogether hold off and just work with
[4059.76 - 4063.20] the
[4061.04 - 4064.96] foods if you're somebody that loves
[4063.20 - 4066.48] supplements or doesn't mind taking
[4064.96 - 4068.24] things and knowing what you're taking
[4066.48 - 4069.72] whatever you don't mind what you know
[4068.24 - 4072.20] you love knowing what you're taking what
[4069.72 - 4074.64] it's for then you know then go into it
[4072.20 - 4079.20] the way you feel you need to go into it
[4074.64 - 4081.60] so baby step baby step baby step baby
[4079.20 - 4083.80] step well that's what I would do is baby
[4081.60 - 4085.80] step and if you're confused about what
[4083.80 - 4087.68] kind of vitamins because different zinc
[4085.80 - 4089.52] and it's true I've seen zincs out there
[4087.68 - 4091.84] where I've tried where I've almost I've
[4089.52 - 4093.64] spit it out and I couldn't believe what
[4091.84 - 4095.44] went in my mouth because it had so much
[4093.64 - 4099.44] citric acid in there it was like poison
[4095.44 - 4102.44] it had it had so much preservative in
[4099.44 - 4103.96] it I couldn't believe what entered my
[4102.44 - 4107.68] mouth I've tried all so many different
[4103.96 - 4110.60] things out there and I I would squirt
[4107.68 - 4112.96] this zinc from a reputable company just
[4110.60 - 4115.24] right in my mouth and and it would burn
[4112.96 - 4117.76] a hole in my mou throat and mouth
[4115.24 - 4122.00] because it had it had an ounce of citric
[4117.76 - 4125.28] acid just in there oh my God and so for
[4122.00 - 4127.84] that reason I I I put a note in there
[4125.28 - 4129.72] saying go to my directory I don't sell
[4127.84 - 4131.80] the supplements on my directory I'm not
[4129.72 - 4133.08] in the supplement you know business or
[4131.80 - 4135.04] anything like that I don't sell the
[4133.08 - 4137.48] supplements but go to my directory so
[4135.04 - 4139.52] you don't go to the store and buy the
[4137.48 - 4141.08] zinc that has all that citric acid in it
[4139.52 - 4142.92] or something like that and it's like
[4141.08 - 4144.56] that with with with all supplements
[4142.92 - 4147.92] meaning you just got to be cautious with
[4144.56 - 4151.92] whatever so I put I put a note saying if
[4147.92 - 4153.64] you want the ones that I trust that will
[4151.92 - 4157.12] you that make that list or whatever then
[4153.64 - 4159.80] go to the directory at at Medical medium
[4157.12 - 4162.60] and did that to protect you
[4159.80 - 4163.76] um and so uh so when it comes down to
[4162.60 - 4165.04] supplements you know work with your
[4163.76 - 4167.32] ition you might have a practitioner
[4165.04 - 4169.32] that's really really liberal with
[4167.32 - 4170.84] supplements really liberal and they're
[4169.32 - 4172.32] just and they're just like no okay
[4170.84 - 4174.12] listen I want you on this I want you on
[4172.32 - 4176.96] that I want you on this this this this
[4174.12 - 4178.24] this this is great and then you and you
[4176.96 - 4180.76] might have practitioners already have
[4178.24 - 4182.20] you on a few of those supplements so
[4180.76 - 4183.80] they're like okay no this is great you
[4182.20 - 4185.88] can do this you can do this so you just
[4183.80 - 4186.80] you know you you you take it one step at
[4185.88 - 4189.08] a
[4186.80 - 4191.52] time
[4189.08 - 4193.72] um but just
[4191.52 - 4195.00] know that you're moving yourself to
[4193.72 - 4197.08] healing and if you're afraid of
[4195.00 - 4198.76] supplements in general and you don't
[4197.08 - 4200.76] like them or don't have any money you

[4267.80 - 4273.36] medical medium their thyroid issues and
[4270.68 - 4276.48] that's just from one chapter in medical
[4273.36 - 4279.08] medium one chapter on thyroid in the
[4276.48 - 4281.32] book medical medium that's all I did was
[4279.08 - 4284.16] one chapter this is a whole book on
[4281.32 - 4287.00] thyroid but there's just one chapter
[4284.16 - 4287.00] and they heal their
[4287.12 - 4290.40] thyroids and and and I'm not just
[4289.04 - 4291.72] talking about one or two people I'm
[4290.40 - 4293.40] talking about hundreds of people and
[4291.72 - 4295.92] hundreds of people have healed their
[4293.40 - 4298.64] thyroids from just that one chapter and
[4295.92 - 4300.00] knowing information that count it and so
[4298.64 - 4303.12] that's what's happening here and you got
[4300.00 - 4304.52] a whole whole book to read through so if
[4303.12 - 4306.36] you if you need to be slow on
[4304.52 - 4309.48] supplements if you need to be kind of
[4306.36 - 4311.48] you know slow on the subs or slow on you
[4309.48 - 4314.08] need to be slow on the
[4311.48 - 4315.60] foods then take your time then take your

[4315.60 - 4318.60] is going to help you take one day at a
[4316.96 - 4320.20] time but you'll get to the foods and
[4318.60 - 4322.24] you'll get to some of the
[4320.20 - 4323.88] supplements you'll get to some of those
[4322.24 - 4325.60] supplements that are really helpful
[4323.88 - 4328.84] there's a whole thing on iodine in there
[4325.60 - 4330.28] how iodine Works Sea vegetables and so
[4328.84 - 4332.12] forth because there's a complete
[4330.28 - 4336.52] misconception out there about iodine
[4332.12 - 4338.08] iodine is a disinfectant the reason why
[4336.52 - 4339.88] some people with hashimotos have a
[4338.08 - 4342.44] reaction if they put a whole bunch of
[4339.88 - 4344.24] iodine in them because they actually in
[4342.44 - 4346.08] this in this reaction is considered
[4344.24 - 4348.44] negative and you don't want a huge
[4346.08 - 4350.08] reaction but it's considered negative to
[4348.44 - 4351.52] practitioners and doctors so they say oh
[4350.08 - 4353.64] stay away from iodine it could flare
[4351.52 - 4356.68] Hashimoto what iodine
[4353.64 - 4358.72] does is it goes after the virus meaning
[4356.68 - 4360.72] it actually is a disinfectant it kills
[4358.72 - 4362.72] all bugs all pathogens you put a
[4360.72 - 4364.08] pathogen in a Petri dish and you stick
[4362.72 - 4365.24] iodine in there and guess what the
[4364.08 - 4368.04] pathogen
[4365.24 - 4369.88] dies you put iodine in your throat and
[4368.04 - 4371.68] you got Hashimoto's and it's saturated
[4369.88 - 4374.64] with Epstein bar that has that that that
[4371.68 - 4376.20] thyroid with Hashimoto is saturated with
[4374.64 - 4377.56] with epine bar and you put you put
[4376.20 - 4378.80] iodine in there and you're going to get
[4377.56 - 4380.52] you're going to it's like shocking the
[4378.80 - 4383.32] thyroid because it's killing off so many
[4380.52 - 4385.64] bugs you don't want to do it that way
[4383.32 - 4387.72] but you can't be afraid of a little
[4385.64 - 4389.84] iodine and a half a teaspoon of
[4387.72 - 4392.48] Spirulina or a little touch of iodine
[4389.84 - 4394.76] and some dolls or a little bit of
[4392.48 - 4396.60] kelp because you don't want to be iodine
[4394.76 - 4398.32] deficient with Epstein bar you don't
[4396.60 - 4399.84] want to be iodine efficient with any
[4398.32 - 4402.36] kind of thyroid disease or thyroid
[4399.84 - 4405.20] illness or thyroid
[4402.36 - 4407.00] problems so that's something be to
[4405.20 - 4409.04] consider you know read that whole area
[4407.00 - 4411.16] read that whole that whole area
[4409.04 - 4413.40] carefully so um that's a whole another
[4411.16 - 4418.24] kind of thing
[4413.40 - 4421.32] and now you may Wonder there's an
[4418.24 - 4424.56] insomnia there's a sleep
[4421.32 - 4426.56] section A sleep section in thyroid
[4424.56 - 4429.24] healing I'm going to take another sip of
[4426.56 - 4429.24] tea bear with
[4430.72 - 4437.28] me you may Wonder why that's in there
[4434.36 - 4439.88] like is it odd is it out of sorts it
[4437.28 - 4442.04] actually the opposite insomnia and
[4439.88 - 4445.40] sleeping problems is blamed on thyroid
[4442.04 - 4447.84] more now than it ever has been in
[4445.40 - 4449.68] history maybe you've already experienced
[4447.84 - 4451.16] that because you're sleeping problems
[4449.68 - 4452.48] and then wait a minute your thyroids off
[4451.16 - 4455.80] as Hashim Modas that's why you're not
[4452.48 - 4458.88] sleeping I hurt it every day I hurt it
[4455.80 - 4461.20] every single day out there over and over
[4458.88 - 4463.08] and over again well I've had sleeping
[4461.20 - 4464.12] problems my doctor thinks it's uh it's
[4463.08 - 4467.76] the
[4464.12 - 4470.08] thyroid IT it became the easy out
[4467.76 - 4471.72] symptom any kind of sleep problems
[4470.08 - 4475.48] that's your
[4471.72 - 4478.44] thyroid so I had to dedicate a section
[4475.48 - 4480.52] with multiple chapters in the sleep in
[4478.44 - 4483.24] the Sleep World in the Sleep Department
[4480.52 - 4486.16] in the thyroid book I had no
[4483.24 - 4488.48] choice because yes it's a symptom but
[4486.16 - 4490.24] it's it's it's now there's so many
[4488.48 - 4492.52] people and you may be experiencing that
[4490.24 - 4494.28] are having sleep problems in general
[4492.52 - 4496.08] having sleep problems for anything for
[4494.28 - 4497.52] to to having sleep problems one way or
[4496.08 - 4498.76] another whether it's restless legs or
[4497.52 - 4500.72] just having sleep problems or they're
[4498.76 - 4503.40] having whatever it
[4500.72 - 4506.52] is and it's being all thrown in the in
[4503.40 - 4508.72] the thyroid basket if it's not diagnosed
[4506.52 - 4511.40] with lime which is a whole another thing
[4508.72 - 4512.84] whole another story on down the road
[4511.40 - 4514.52] I'll have to put a whole book out on
[4512.84 - 4516.56] Lime to set the record
[4514.52 - 4518.36] straight I'm definitely going to have to
[4516.56 - 4519.96] do that I did a chapter in book one
[4518.36 - 4521.56] medical meeting but I have to do a whole
[4519.96 - 4524.00] a whole book on it and I know that I'm
[4521.56 - 4525.64] I'm dreading it I'm dreading it cuz when
[4524.00 - 4527.20] it gets controversial when anything gets
[4525.64 - 4528.92] too controversial you just get nothing
[4527.20 - 4530.72] but Stones thrown at you you get
[4528.92 - 4532.96] pitchforks and knives and Tor you know
[4530.72 - 4534.76] torches you get all that starts
[4532.96 - 4537.72] happening cuz when you put real truth
[4534.76 - 4540.36] out there you know what happens which by
[4537.72 - 4542.12] the way is there any way any anybody
[4540.36 - 4545.44] there if you like thyroid healing can
[4542.12 - 4550.00] you put a review on Amazon for spirit
[4545.44 - 4551.96] and I Spirit would love it um I like it
[4550.00 - 4554.00] because the spirit likes it because it
[4551.96 - 4555.48] can help people
[4554.00 - 4557.88] it can truly help them because they'll
[4555.48 - 4559.84] know there's there's some good
[4557.88 - 4562.12] information in this document there's
[4559.84 - 4564.72] some good information that's healing for
[4562.12 - 4566.28] people so if you can I know you're busy
[4564.72 - 4568.92] and you got busy lives and it's a pain
[4566.28 - 4573.16] in the butt but if you can just put any
[4568.92 - 4575.24] kind of review you feel um uh on Amazon
[4573.16 - 4577.88] uh for thyroid healing we would be so
[4575.24 - 4579.56] grateful grateful grateful because
[4577.88 - 4581.96] there's going to be an onslaught of also
[4579.56 - 4583.64] torches and pitchforks because of
[4581.96 - 4586.08] because of how controversial this is
[4583.64 - 4587.68] because when you when you show the truth
[4586.08 - 4590.32] and you show the body's not attacking
[4587.68 - 4593.04] itself and you and you try to get the
[4590.32 - 4595.52] truth out there there's also this this
[4593.04 - 4597.40] small army of people that just hate that
[4595.52 - 4599.28] and they end up just you know throwing
[4597.40 - 4601.80] stones and rocks so if you can do that
[4599.28 - 4603.56] that would be so appreciated I can't
[4601.80 - 4606.00] even tell you and I hate asking anything
[4603.56 - 4608.76] of you I swear to God I hate
[4606.00 - 4610.64] it because you know I know you're busy
[4608.76 - 4612.52] and I know you got so much going on in
[4610.64 - 4614.56] your life and just know that I care and
[4612.52 - 4617.92] I totally understand
[4614.56 - 4619.44] that um but when you have the truth in
[4617.92 - 4622.48] your hand it's going to help you in
[4619.44 - 4624.00] every way possible in every way possible
[4622.48 - 4627.72] it's going to
[4624.00 - 4630.64] help so the Sleep Department needed more
[4627.72 - 4632.68] it just it just needed more I mean sure
[4630.64 - 4635.52] there could be chapters on every single
[4632.68 - 4638.60] symptom that's in there that Spirit can
[4635.52 - 4640.76] provide additional information but in
[4638.60 - 4642.48] the Sleep realm it's being packaged into
[4640.76 - 4644.76] thyroid and it's not a thyroid problem
[4642.48 - 4647.24] sleeping is not a thyroid
[4644.76 - 4650.00] problem but sleeping can be anything
[4647.24 - 4652.04] from stress cortisol adrenals viral
[4650.00 - 4653.80] issues like Epstein bar the liver being
[4652.04 - 4656.52] unhappy the liver being sluggish the
[4653.80 - 4657.60] liver being completely burdened um
[4656.52 - 4659.76] sensitive nervous systems
[4657.60 - 4663.20] neurotransmitter issues all these
[4659.76 - 4665.56] different things is our sleeping
[4663.20 - 4667.32] problems from different varieties of
[4665.56 - 4668.72] stress from different varieties of worry
[4667.32 - 4670.48] from subconscious worry from
[4668.72 - 4672.96] subconscious stress from all kinds of
[4670.48 - 4675.28] things could be your sleeping problem so
[4672.96 - 4677.00] so I had to put a good section in there
[4675.28 - 4678.92] because they can't get all picked off as
[4677.00 - 4680.44] just thyroid so it had the record had to
[4678.92 - 4683.16] be set with sleeping so I hope you
[4680.44 - 4685.48] enjoyed that there's a chapter in there
[4683.16 - 4687.96] a very small one of why bad dreams are
[4685.48 - 4690.68] pretty good for you you might get a kick
[4687.96 - 4692.64] out of it I know it's t you know it's
[4690.68 - 4696.20] it's I know it's taking it's going a
[4692.64 - 4696.20] little bit on the spiritual side of
[4696.76 - 4703.68] things and um but it's it's
[4700.28 - 4705.44] powerful because what happens is we heal
[4703.68 - 4707.00] through our bad dreams it doesn't mean
[4705.44 - 4708.48] when you have good dreams and only good
[4707.00 - 4711.00] dreams that you're never healing or
[4708.48 - 4713.28] you're a bad person that's not it at
[4711.00 - 4715.08] all I just said every now and then if
[4713.28 - 4717.08] you ever get a bad dream one every 10
[4715.08 - 4719.60] years one every 30 years one every 20
[4717.08 - 4722.04] years is's a reason for it that's your
[4719.60 - 4723.68] body healing if you get a bad dream
[4722.04 - 4726.44] every night there's a reason for it I
[4723.68 - 4727.20] get a bad dream I get bad dreams I do
[4726.44 - 4729.60] some
[4727.20 - 4732.12] healing I do some healing I get some bad
[4729.60 - 4733.72] dreams here and there I've seen so much
[4732.12 - 4735.16] in my life and I've been through so much
[4733.72 - 4736.52] in my life and with this gift and
[4735.16 - 4740.24] everything
[4736.52 - 4742.68] else that yeah I have some bad
[4740.24 - 4745.64] dreams but that's how you let things
[4742.68 - 4746.92] loose and let things out and you heal in
[4745.64 - 4748.08] different ways different parts of
[4746.92 - 4749.72] healing you don't have to have bad
[4748.08 - 4751.44] dreams to heal in all kinds of different
[4749.72 - 4753.32] ways you don't have to have bad dreams
[4751.44 - 4755.04] to heal your thyroid but just letting
[4753.32 - 4757.96] you know since we were talking about
[4755.04 - 4761.12] sleep so much in those chapters that I
[4757.96 - 4763.76] thought I would throw that little tidbit
[4761.12 - 4766.52] that Spirit has taught me so much
[4763.76 - 4768.08] out and I hope you enjoy it I hope you
[4766.52 - 4772.56] enjoy
[4768.08 - 4775.92] it when we get diagnosed with
[4772.56 - 4778.88] something it it can hit us really
[4775.92 - 4780.44] hard you know I when especially when
[4778.88 - 4782.72] when we're younger too when we're
[4780.44 - 4786.48] younger I mean I've seen so many people
[4782.72 - 4788.36] in their early 20s and late 20s get
[4786.48 - 4790.64] diagnosed with with a thyroid condition
[4788.36 - 4793.64] and they feel like their life is
[4790.64 - 4795.32] over and and even their spouse or their
[4793.64 - 4797.04] fian or their boyfriends or their
[4795.32 - 4798.64] husbands they just can't they can't hack
[4797.04 - 4799.92] it I've seen this happen so many times
[4798.64 - 4802.16] I've seen so many
[4799.92 - 4806.16] breakups so many
[4802.16 - 4809.68] breakups because it was just scary for
[4806.16 - 4812.52] the boyfriend or the husband or the or
[4809.68 - 4813.60] the uh fiance it was just so scary that
[4812.52 - 4816.52] their
[4813.60 - 4818.44] 25-year-old partner you know has this
[4816.52 - 4819.96] thyroid problem so what next and then
[4818.44 - 4821.44] when you look into thyroid problem and
[4819.96 - 4824.52] you look into Hashimoto of the body
[4821.44 - 4826.96] destroying and it's attacking itself
[4824.52 - 4829.08] it can make a a person run away from a
[4826.96 - 4832.32] partner and this is one of the most
[4829.08 - 4835.12] disturbing reasons I feel is part of the
[4832.32 - 4836.68] misinformation trap that's out there
[4835.12 - 4840.16] I've seen
[4836.68 - 4842.96] couples completely alter their Destiny
[4840.16 - 4845.92] and completely split up when they were
[4842.96 - 4847.40] very happy together because of
[4845.92 - 4848.60] information that floats around in the
[4847.40 - 4850.04] internet and other books like for
[4848.60 - 4851.88] instance like Hashimoto is being the
[4850.04 - 4853.60] body destroying itself which is wrong
[4851.88 - 4855.44] it's about the body attacking itself and
[4853.60 - 4857.12] causing all this harm and how where
[4855.44 - 4859.56] things can go if it's not under control
[4857.12 - 4861.04] and all these things and I've seen
[4859.56 - 4864.48] people run from each
[4861.04 - 4866.80] other and young women just lose partners
[4864.48 - 4870.44] and have to and and just and and wallow
[4866.80 - 4873.60] in in agony over that their
[4870.44 - 4875.64] diagnosis and it's
[4873.60 - 4877.96] heartbreaking and I I I've seen this
[4875.64 - 4880.08] with women in their 30s men and women in
[4877.96 - 4883.44] their 30s
[4880.08 - 4884.60] happening and um and even seen it with
[4883.44 - 4887.04] women in their
[4884.60 - 4888.64] 40s the divorce suddenly happens during
[4887.04 - 4890.84] the Hashim Modas
[4888.64 - 4893.56] diagnosis I've seen
[4890.84 - 4895.20] this and so this is from misinformation
[4893.56 - 4898.72] out there that's what this is putting
[4895.20 - 4901.96] fear into women and into and into uh the
[4898.72 - 4904.00] system in general that creates these
[4901.96 - 4905.68] imbalances what I'm saying is if you've
[4904.00 - 4907.48] been diagnosed young or you're you're
[4905.68 - 4910.64] young now and you're diagnos with with
[4907.48 - 4912.16] Hashim just don't fear it don't get
[4910.64 - 4913.60] scared don't think your life is over
[4912.16 - 4914.88] don't think you're dependent on hormones
[4913.60 - 4915.92] for the rest of your life don't think
[4914.88 - 4917.52] that you're going to have problems for
[4915.92 - 4920.08] the rest of your life don't think any of
[4917.52 - 4923.20] that you've had a little bug in you a
[4920.08 - 4925.76] little viral issue that you've had that
[4923.20 - 4927.56] frankly most people have in their system
[4925.76 - 4930.32] doing something one way or another that
[4927.56 - 4933.08] we all live with that you can clean up
[4930.32 - 4935.76] and break down and help and
[4933.08 - 4937.08] restore and get your life back mentally
[4935.76 - 4940.16] emotionally and
[4937.08 - 4941.64] physically and you can take control so
[4940.16 - 4942.84] if your moms and you have a daughter
[4941.64 - 4943.68] this is something you can tell daughter
[4942.84 - 4945.12] that's going through the same things
[4943.68 - 4946.44] it's not because mom had it now the
[4945.12 - 4949.32] daughter has it and it's genetic that's
[4946.44 - 4951.40] not how it works that's not how it
[4949.32 - 4952.72] works and then your child's going to
[4951.40 - 4955.24] have it because it's genetic no that's
[4952.72 - 4957.96] not how it works that's another big
[4955.24 - 4960.56] round of misinformation that's out there
[4957.96 - 4963.84] that's one more thing I just wanted to
[4960.56 - 4965.60] tell everybody here about before um the
[4963.84 - 4967.96] webinar ends and I just I just wanted
[4965.60 - 4968.92] everybody to know this and it's
[4967.96 - 4970.00] difficult when you're young because
[4968.92 - 4970.92] you're starting your career you're
[4970.00 - 4971.96] trying to look for a career you're
[4970.92 - 4973.16] trying to figure out school you're
[4971.96 - 4974.96] trying to figure out what you're doing
[4973.16 - 4976.12] maybe your job maybe you love your job
[4974.96 - 4977.56] maybe you're doing things and you get
[4976.12 - 4979.32] given this diagnosis and you got these
[4977.56 - 4982.32] symptoms you don't understand them you
[4979.32 - 4984.60] fight you fight forward you heal up you
[4982.32 - 4986.68] you take what you deserve meaning good
[4984.60 - 4989.24] health and freedom and you grab that
[4986.68 - 4991.32] freedom you deserve it and you take that
[4989.24 - 4993.72] and you hold it in your hand and you
[4991.32 - 4995.28] keep that as armor and you fight for it
[4993.72 - 4996.92] and you do what you need to do and I say
[4995.28 - 4998.48] that for anybody in any age it's just
[4996.92 - 5000.16] that the younger people I noticed they
[4998.48 - 5003.48] suffer more mentally and emotionally
[5000.16 - 5006.52] when they're not feeling well
[5003.48 - 5008.80] and and and it's just it's unbelievable
[5006.52 - 5010.60] with with what younger younger people
[5008.80 - 5012.20] have to go through and of course I feel
[5010.60 - 5014.56] that way with everybody no matter what
[5012.20 - 5017.04] age if you're my age or older or
[5014.56 - 5019.64] whatever your age is I feel that for
[5017.04 - 5021.56] everybody but I notice that the world
[5019.64 - 5024.36] has changed there's a chapter in there
[5021.56 - 5026.68] about creating your illness how we don't
[5024.36 - 5029.68] create our illness I'm noticing that the
[5026.68 - 5031.92] young people are falling tra in prey to
[5029.68 - 5034.12] a Consciousness that's developing a
[5031.92 - 5036.04] trendy trap of how if you're sick with
[5034.12 - 5037.32] Hashimoto and you're 25 that means you
[5036.04 - 5038.80] must have wished it on yourself that
[5037.32 - 5042.04] means it's bad karma that means you
[5038.80 - 5044.64] created it and that's why that chapter's
[5042.04 - 5046.20] in there to clarify that so make sure if
[5044.64 - 5047.56] Mommy if you got a daughter and your
[5046.20 - 5049.16] daughter's thinking that because she's
[5047.56 - 5050.80] getting diagnosed with hypothyroid make
[5049.16 - 5052.64] sure she reads that
[5050.80 - 5054.48] chapter because there's so much
[5052.64 - 5056.84] misinformation out there once again
[5054.48 - 5060.96] about that alone it's poisonous
[5056.84 - 5062.92] destructive and it just does so much
[5060.96 - 5066.68] damage to our

[5094.72 - 5099.80] useless meaning it it breaks down it's
[5097.40 - 5101.56] weak and once you know the power that
[5099.80 - 5103.20] you have it breaks down even more your
[5101.56 - 5105.12] immune system goes after it even more
[5103.20 - 5106.60] and does what it needs to do once you

[5129.00 - 5133.88] triggers so it could take longer because
[5130.84 - 5136.20] of your triggers that's okay you still
[5133.88 - 5138.64] can heal and still will get better over
[5136.20 - 5140.28] time and sometimes there's healing going
[5138.64 - 5143.56] on well all the time there's healing
[5140.28 - 5145.28] going on but sometimes the delayed
[5143.56 - 5146.80] effect of saying getting rid of all the
[5145.28 - 5148.68] symptoms and maybe you get rid of six
[5146.80 - 5150.84] symptoms out of 10 some of the symptoms
[5148.68 - 5152.28] that lag a little later are from made
[5150.84 - 5154.76] maybe damaged nerves that need to heal

[5226.80 - 5230.80] that I could kind of cover I mean I know
[5228.24 - 5232.32] you have the book now but but if there's
[5230.80 - 5235.12] anything else I'm giving you even
[5232.32 - 5238.08] tidbits that that you know that are are
[5235.12 - 5239.32] wherever I can get them from um from my
[5238.08 - 5241.32] experience and from Spirit and
[5239.32 - 5243.68] everything giving you tidbits now of
[5241.32 - 5245.64] anything that can be helpful cuz I want
[5243.68 - 5247.28] you to to get as much help as you can
[5245.64 - 5250.08] and help as you need I covered the
[5247.28 - 5253.56] supplements a little bit I covered the
[5250.08 - 5258.40] um Foods a little bit now what I did in
[5253.56 - 5260.44] this book is I put a a couple of things
[5258.40 - 5263.00] about what the food does and what it's
[5260.44 - 5264.44] doing for you when it comes down to
[5263.00 - 5266.04] dealing with any kind of thyroid
[5264.44 - 5267.48] condition and underlying viral problem
[5266.04 - 5269.36] that's actually causing a thyroid
[5267.48 - 5271.12] condition I'm I'm or and causing other
[5269.36 - 5274.04] symptoms and all kinds of other all
[5271.12 - 5275.24] kinds of symptoms I I put you know a
[5274.04 - 5277.80] little bit of
[5275.24 - 5280.80] information with each
[5277.80 - 5282.44] food make sure you you look into that
[5280.80 - 5283.84] make sure you read that just don't get
[5282.44 - 5286.24] the food and don't read that because
[5283.84 - 5288.48] it's important to kind of know that that
[5286.24 - 5290.72] food is doing something for you that's
[5288.48 - 5293.64] another thing that reboots and restores
[5290.72 - 5296.92] the immune system and helps clean the
[5293.64 - 5298.96] mess up that's inside it's just that
[5296.92 - 5301.20] there's information in food and if you
[5298.96 - 5302.44] know what that information is something
[5301.20 - 5306.08] happens with the immune system system as
[5302.44 - 5309.56] it uses the food so so when that food
[5306.08 - 5311.48] goes in you it's going in you with an
[5309.56 - 5313.32] intention your thoughts your
[5311.48 - 5315.40] Consciousness connects to that that that
[5313.32 - 5318.08] intention of what the food does for you
[5315.40 - 5320.08] anyway your immune system binds on grabs
[5318.08 - 5322.88] on to that intention of what the food's
[5320.08 - 5325.52] doing for you and literally the food
[5322.88 - 5328.16] even works better for you and even
[5325.52 - 5331.00] better so that's why I put those notes
[5328.16 - 5334.00] there about every food that's why I did
[5331.00 - 5334.00] that
[5334.44 - 5341.20] um just you know take it one day at time
[5338.32 - 5342.88] take it one day at a time if you feel
[5341.20 - 5345.04] like you're getting overwhelmed it's
[5342.88 - 5348.84] okay take a little break take one day at
[5345.04 - 5350.76] a time whatever you need to do and um
[5348.84 - 5353.60] just have a little patience like you've
[5350.76 - 5356.04] always had and if you've been sick for a
[5353.60 - 5358.56] day in your life or know someone who has
[5356.04 - 5361.20] you already know that you've you've you
[5358.56 - 5362.88] have patience within you or someone also
[5361.20 - 5364.68] that that's been for day in their life
[5362.88 - 5368.76] they know you know they have patience
[5364.68 - 5370.76] within them and have some compassion for
[5368.76 - 5372.28] yourself have some compassion for
[5370.76 - 5375.08] yourself your body is not destroying
[5372.28 - 5377.04] itself you can heal your Hashimoto you
[5375.08 - 5378.64] can do more than just heal it you can do
[5377.04 - 5381.36] do more than just get the numbers
[5378.64 - 5384.32] straight you can do more than just get
[5381.36 - 5387.12] your symptoms better you can really get
[5384.32 - 5389.76] past this whole thing and keep it
[5387.12 - 5392.08] concrete and hold it strong and then go
[5389.76 - 5394.20] back to this book and get information to

[5396.88 - 5400.12] down the road and everything else
[5398.76 - 5402.64] because the information out there's
[5400.12 - 5404.68] flawed so this can really move you
[5402.64 - 5408.44] forward and get you to where you need to
[5404.68 - 5411.08] be and take one day at a time keep a lie

[5429.68 - 5434.68] system if you got a friend who's sick
[5432.64 - 5436.28] you're compassionate towards that friend
