[20.36 - 25.04] show where each week we talk about the
[22.08 - 26.84] most advanced healing information most
[25.04 - 29.72] advanced health information that's out
[26.84 - 31.04] there anywhere and decades ahead of
[29.72 - 32.24] what's out there now as far as research
[31.04 - 34.40] and Science and everything else and
[32.24 - 36.20] that's how you get people better just
[34.40 - 39.12] like the 16 ounces of celery juice on an
[36.20 - 41.24] empty stomach every single morning is R
[39.12 - 42.28] literally changing the world right now
[41.24 - 45.20] and that's the medical medium
[42.28 - 47.16] information The Source spirit and it's
[45.20 - 49.28] changing the world right now and it's
[47.16 - 52.56] helping to clean up people's blood
[49.28 - 56.32] because people have toxic blood today's
[52.56 - 58.12] talk is on is your blood toxic is your
[56.32 - 60.44] blood toxic this is really an important
[58.12 - 63.52] show all the way around from for so many

[66.52 - 70.56] get better it's how I've gotten people
[68.16 - 73.76] better for decades and decades and
[70.56 - 76.36] decades and and it matters that much to
[73.76 - 78.48] have even the smallest piece of
[76.36 - 81.04] information that's never been out there
[78.48 - 82.32] before which is straight celery juice
[81.04 - 84.20] that's an example because that's
[82.32 - 85.84] actually good for your blood good for
[84.20 - 87.20] getting your blood not to be toxic
[85.84 - 90.24] that's why I'm even bringing it up right
[87.20 - 93.72] now but it's a prime example how one one
[90.24 - 95.28] little gem one little gem can be that
[93.72 - 97.24] lifechanging can you imagine all the
[95.28 - 98.92] other gems that are in Liver Rescue can
[97.24 - 100.64] you imagine all the other gems that are
[98.92 - 102.20] in the other medical medium series books
[100.64 - 104.84] that Spirit has delivered and that's the
[102.20 - 107.68] whole point so everyone starts to turn
[104.84 - 110.40] their life around and it matters you're
[107.68 - 111.92] worth it you're absolutely worth it
[110.40 - 113.76] you're worth doing the things you need
[111.92 - 115.52] to do you're worth seeking out the right
[113.76 - 118.24] information you're worth staying away
[115.52 - 119.48] from misinformation you're worth it all
[118.24 - 120.36] and you're worth staying away from the
[119.48 - 122.24] trend
[120.36 - 123.96] someone said to me hey the celery juice
[122.24 - 126.72] it's a trend now no actually the celery
[123.96 - 128.44] juice is the PowerHouse and then the
[126.72 - 129.48] trend is trying to destroy it now
[128.44 - 130.96] they're trying to destroy it they're
[129.48 - 132.80] saying oh wait a minute you shouldn't do
[130.96 - 134.16] all straight celery juice Oh that's oh
[132.80 - 136.28] wait a minute you should do this put
[134.16 - 138.28] this put pre P protein in with it do
[136.28 - 140.08] this the trend is out there to try to
[138.28 - 141.96] actually break it down and ruin it
[140.08 - 144.84] actually that's what trends do so no
[141.96 - 146.64] it's not a trend it's a truth celery
[144.84 - 147.76] juice is a truth and I'm talking about
[146.64 - 149.12] it a little bit because we're talking
[147.76 - 150.48] about toxic blood what are we talking
[149.12 - 152.00] about talking about dark circles under
[150.48 - 153.68] the eyes varicose veins we're talking
[152.00 - 156.24] about reenal syndrome you know the
[153.68 - 158.56] discoloration and all the symptoms when
[156.24 - 159.68] you get the the purple blotches and
[158.56 - 160.92] you're you're you're feel like the
[159.68 - 162.08] circulation isn't there and your
[160.92 - 164.68] extremities and everything else we're
[162.08 - 166.80] going to talk about that a little bit um
[164.68 - 169.12] I mean list goes on we can talk about a
[166.80 - 170.24] lot of things gout we can talk about
[169.12 - 171.72] everything that has something to do with
[170.24 - 174.36] dirty blood and you think that those
[171.72 - 176.24] don't apply to you you think that gout
[174.36 - 178.20] or Renault syndrome or anything else
[176.24 - 180.32] doesn't apply to you you're wrong
[178.20 - 183.52] because it's more than that toxic blood
[180.32 - 185.40] causes problems everywhere it causes
[183.52 - 186.64] every problem you can possibly imagine
[185.40 - 188.36] when your blood's toxic with certain
[186.64 - 190.00] things in it you get the brain fog when
[188.36 - 191.88] your blood's toxic with certain stuff in
[190.00 - 193.40] it you get all kinds of symptoms you get
[191.88 - 195.12] the fatigue you get everything that
[193.40 - 196.80] that's the whole point is your blood
[195.12 - 199.32] toxic and we're going to go deep into
[196.80 - 202.56] this deep into this indeed because it
[199.32 - 205.16] needs to be done you know I can't I
[202.56 - 207.96] can't just sit around and wait and wait
[205.16 - 210.72] and wait hoping that chronic illness is
[207.96 - 212.24] going to slow down out there it's not
[210.72 - 213.84] unless the information gets in your
[212.24 - 215.32] hands unless you become the expert I
[213.84 - 218.72] want you to become the expert I really
[215.32 - 220.36] do so here's the deal here's a deal is
[218.72 - 221.56] your blood toxic how does this work
[220.36 - 223.80] first of all I'm going to start off
[221.56 - 226.16] right here right now with this there are
[223.80 - 228.08] so many things in our blood so many
[226.16 - 229.96] different toxins in our blood that
[228.08 - 232.56] science and research in the medical
[229.96 - 235.04] industry can't even do an analysis on
[232.56 - 237.36] they can't even analyze it blood Labs
[235.04 - 239.72] don't even have the ability to see
[237.36 - 242.84] what's inside our blood they don't it's
[239.72 - 244.52] limited it's absolutely limited they
[242.84 - 245.92] can't see the petrochemicals inside your
[244.52 - 247.12] blood can they can they see the
[245.92 - 249.00] petrochemicals that are inside your
[247.12 - 250.72] blood you tell me can they see all the
[249.00 - 252.44] solvents that are inside your blood you
[250.72 - 253.76] you tell me can they all those
[252.44 - 254.68] detergents and spray cleaners and
[253.76 - 256.16] everything else that have all these
[254.68 - 257.60] petrochemicals and solvents can they see
[256.16 - 259.20] all that in your bloodstream when they
[257.60 - 261.76] draw blood do you hear that come back
[259.20 - 263.92] from the doctor's office no no of course
[261.76 - 265.44] not do they see any viral material in
[263.92 - 267.40] the in the blood no they don't see
[265.44 - 269.04] byproduct in the blood they never do
[267.40 - 270.60] they never see byproduct they never see
[269.04 - 272.24] viral stuff they never see all that
[270.60 - 274.12] discharge from all the bugs they never
[272.24 - 276.04] see all that either in the blood do they
[274.12 - 280.20] see heavy metals in the blood
[276.04 - 282.80] no no now unless you literally unless
[280.20 - 285.12] honestly you stepped into a mine of lead
[282.80 - 287.28] a Lead Mine somewhere you know what I
[285.12 - 288.84] mean and you were bathing in lead water
[287.28 - 290.28] and they could be like yeah you got lead
[288.84 - 291.76] poisoning they do blood they could
[290.28 - 293.36] actually they could find the lead sure
[291.76 - 296.64] that's different but I'm talking about
[293.36 - 298.36] traces that that torment people's lives
[296.64 - 299.36] on a daily basis that are just floating
[298.36 - 300.80] around the bloodstream you go to the
[299.36 - 303.24] doctor doctor's office you come back you
[300.80 - 305.64] can't they can't see all this stuff it's
[303.24 - 308.00] not possible and what about other things
[305.64 - 310.24] too what about all the other things too
[308.00 - 312.96] what about domestic the domestic
[310.24 - 314.84] Invasion the domestic Invasion that's
[312.96 - 318.12] means household products that we're
[314.84 - 319.92] using every day um plug-in fresheners
[318.12 - 322.40] we're using plug-in fresheners we're
[319.92 - 324.12] using uh aerosols we're using yeah you
[322.40 - 326.80] know whatever air fresheners everywhere
[324.12 - 328.56] what about that the assault on that what
[326.80 - 330.60] about when you walk into stores and all
[328.56 - 333.44] that candles and all those perfumes and
[330.60 - 335.52] all the cologne you smell everywhere
[333.44 - 338.00] that's in the bloodstream do you think
[335.52 - 339.52] it just just magically disappears do you
[338.00 - 341.92] think we don't need to take care of our
[339.52 - 344.12] blood and our liver do you think we
[341.92 - 345.76] don't need to take I mean seriously what
[344.12 - 347.56] about going to the gasoline station go
[345.76 - 349.40] in gasoline station gra just pump your
[347.56 - 350.76] own gas oh fumees coming out breathe it
[349.40 - 352.08] right in oh that doesn't go into our
[350.76 - 353.40] bloodstream no that's not going to sit
[352.08 - 354.40] there for a whole day or two or three
[353.40 - 356.36] days just floating around in our
[354.40 - 358.04] bloodstream no and science of research
[356.36 - 359.60] can't can't can't showcase that I me
[358.04 - 362.24] they can't pull blood out and say were
[359.60 - 363.92] you at the gas pump the other day
[362.24 - 365.48] inhaling somebody's gas fumes that was
[363.92 - 366.72] spewing out of their car and and the
[365.48 - 369.04] wind was taking it right to you and
[366.72 - 370.20] you're breathing in straight gasoline
[369.04 - 371.84] where you know with all those
[370.20 - 372.92] petrochemicals going in there going
[371.84 - 374.76] right into your lungs right into your
[372.92 - 377.08] bloodstream and once a week you're at
[374.76 - 378.20] the gas station filling up we you know
[377.08 - 379.72] they're not the doctor's not going to
[378.20 - 381.92] say that the blood lab's not going to
[379.72 - 384.04] say that they're not going to say are
[381.92 - 386.04] you know where were you they're not it
[384.04 - 387.24] doesn't work like that it doesn't when
[386.04 - 388.72] you're working on your when you're doing
[387.24 - 390.12] your gas grill or your gas stove and
[388.72 - 391.48] you're breathing in all burning gas
[390.12 - 392.52] fumes or whatever it is and it's just
[391.48 - 394.20] you know you're cooking every day and
[392.52 - 395.52] you're breathing in all those gas fumes
[394.20 - 397.56] I'm not trying to tell you that you got
[395.52 - 399.44] to hide I'm telling you we got to clean
[397.56 - 400.72] up the blood we got to protect you we
[399.44 - 403.32] have to make sure your blood doesn't get
[400.72 - 405.12] too toxic that's just some of the stuff
[403.32 - 407.28] that could be in the bloodstream that's
[405.12 - 409.80] not even the natural toxins that the
[407.28 - 412.76] body produces see the body is under such
[409.80 - 415.48] a load it's unbelievable every single
[412.76 - 419.24] day it's under such a load it's under
[415.48 - 422.08] adrenaline adrenaline is so darn toxic
[419.24 - 425.80] it's it's not even funny it is literally
[422.08 - 428.04] so darn toxic you could not believe how
[425.80 - 430.92] destructive it is it's it's that
[428.04 - 433.84] destructive even healthy adrenaline like
[430.92 - 435.44] just just something that gets you high
[433.84 - 436.88] something that's gets you high and it
[435.44 - 438.44] seems like it's a good thing like
[436.88 - 439.84] anything like hey I'm going to go skiing
[438.44 - 441.44] and whoa I'm going down a more of a
[439.84 - 443.16] dangerous slope who I never took that
[441.44 - 445.12] way before and wow my adrenaline's
[443.16 - 446.64] pumping I made it down and you're all
[445.12 - 449.44] you're all psyched and happy and that
[446.64 - 451.72] adrenaline right there is doing 101
[449.44 - 453.20] damage damage to the liver damage to
[451.72 - 455.44] everything and I'm not saying you can't
[453.20 - 456.80] do that because you still there were
[455.44 - 458.44] still things that you got out of that
[456.80 - 461.60] was that was really amazing but the
[458.44 - 464.12] point is is that the blood gets toxic
[461.60 - 465.64] that's why we don't live forever that's
[464.12 - 467.20] a whole another reason why we don't live
[465.64 - 469.24] forever I mean you could you'd be
[467.20 - 471.08] surprised yeah I there's people out
[469.24 - 472.96] there is like oh my God I can't believe
[471.08 - 474.96] what happened to that guy oh no what
[472.96 - 476.88] happened to that girl I don't get it
[474.96 - 478.32] what happened to that girl she was she
[476.88 - 480.00] was doing this she was skiing she was
[478.32 - 482.08] snowboarding everything was going great

[486.88 - 491.92] oh this person died this person's gone
[489.00 - 495.16] now who where what happened we got to
[491.92 - 497.16] keep our blood from being toxic it is so
[495.16 - 500.00] important because no matter what it
[497.16 - 502.40] plays a role in every single thing we do
[500.00 - 506.88] in our life and in our health you know
[502.40 - 509.28] and I am so sick so sick to death of all

[643.36 - 648.20] fish oil capsule you'll get more Mercury
[645.24 - 650.36] from that than a can a tuna because it's
[648.20 - 652.72] it's basically homeopathic I talk about
[650.36 - 654.24] in the books too it's homeopathic what
[652.72 - 656.16] it is is when they extract when they
[654.24 - 658.16] pull Mercury out of something it gets
[656.16 - 660.80] stronger believe it or not and sure if
[658.16 - 662.40] Mercury's in it it it's also strong too
[660.80 - 664.24] but when you keep on pulling it out when
[662.40 - 667.16] you centrifuge it out and you give out
[664.24 - 669.28] fish oil it's actually has the memory of
[667.16 - 671.40] mercury which is which causes more
[669.28 - 674.28] effects more effects on the health can
[671.40 - 678.36] you can possibly imagine and so what
[674.28 - 679.96] happens is because it's so so hyper when
[678.36 - 683.24] you pull it out and pull it out it
[679.96 - 684.76] becomes hyper it's a homeopathic option
[683.24 - 686.48] it's really bad so what it is
[684.76 - 688.20] everybody's on the fish oil it's highly
[686.48 - 690.12] inflammatory fish oil they're all on the
[688.20 - 691.84] fish oil
[690.12 - 693.72] unbelievable
[691.84 - 695.16] unbelievable same thing with apple CID
[693.72 - 696.52] of vinegar you want to hurt your liver
[695.16 - 698.72] keep on drinking that Apple CID of
[696.52 - 701.20] vinegar keep on it's the best vinegar
[698.72 - 703.00] there is if you're going to have vinegar
[701.20 - 704.40] do apple cided vinegar absolutely if
[703.00 - 706.04] you're going to have vinegar and I can't
[704.40 - 707.32] stop you if you're going to have vinegar
[706.04 - 709.64] and there's nothing I can do about it
[707.32 - 711.16] let it be apple cider vinegar because
[709.64 - 713.08] it's the best one there is of course
[711.16 - 716.40] it's from apples it's from apples for
[713.08 - 718.16] God's sake it is it's amazing it's
[716.40 - 719.52] amazing stay away from fruit everybody

[719.52 - 722.44] to make sure you're eating plenty of
[720.52 - 724.32] fruit stay away from fruit but do apple
[722.44 - 725.56] cider vinegar stay away from apples oh
[724.32 - 728.68] those apples are too sweet you better
[725.56 - 730.48] eat a green apple oh my God the
[728.68 - 732.08] misinformation you guys are so thick
[730.48 - 735.24] it's unbelievable if you've been
[732.08 - 738.44] affected by it if you've been infected
[735.24 - 740.96] by it uninfect yourself if that's even a
[738.44 - 743.48] word disinfect
[740.96 - 745.68] yourself disinfect yourself from the
[743.48 - 748.00] misinformation that's how you will get
[745.68 - 751.44] more years on your life in this lifetime
[748.00 - 753.16] for yourself I always tell people okay
[751.44 - 755.16] people say well yeah my my uh my
[753.16 - 756.32] grandfather died at 80 he well he would
[755.16 - 758.92] have died at
[756.32 - 759.84] 95 if he did this and this and this and
[758.92 - 762.52] this and
[759.84 - 763.96] this that's right oh you know this
[762.52 - 766.20] person died at 70 it would have died at
[763.96 - 769.32] 80 do you want 10 it's 10 more years
[766.20 - 773.44] even worth having it is worth having 10
[769.32 - 775.12] more years is worth having 10 more years
[773.44 - 777.28] there's people that die at 50 they could
[775.12 - 778.60] have could have made it to 75 they were
[777.28 - 781.32] doing just some of the right things in
[778.60 - 782.60] their life life with their health as
[781.32 - 785.04] people who die at 90 they could have
[782.60 - 787.20] lived to be 115 120 you know it's
[785.04 - 789.24] amazing how it works the point is does
[787.20 - 790.76] it even matter yes it does it matters
[789.24 - 792.32] cuz it's not just about how long you can
[790.76 - 794.48] live regardless it's the quality of your
[792.32 - 795.96] life no matter what it's the quality of
[794.48 - 797.48] your life during when you're living and
[795.96 - 799.00] the whole bit and that matters and so
[797.48 - 800.32] many people and I understand you'll lose
[799.00 - 801.76] the quality of your life because our
[800.32 - 803.00] blood is toxic cuz we don't know what's
[801.76 - 804.28] going on we got all these different
[803.00 - 806.08] things going on back to Apple CID of
[804.28 - 808.52] vinegar cuz I probably angered a whole
[806.08 - 811.16] bunch of you guys like crazy I know it I
[808.52 - 812.40] know it like bees like bees I get it
[811.16 - 814.48] because you're into the apple cider
[812.40 - 816.56] vinegar I totally get it but it pickles
[814.48 - 818.92] the liver you don't know what your liver
[816.56 - 820.52] likes it's unbelievable what we like and
[818.92 - 823.60] what we put in our mouth has nothing to
[820.52 - 826.04] do what what with what the liver likes
[823.60 - 827.68] and that's another thing too in Liver
[826.04 - 829.48] Rescue I talk about that I have a
[827.68 - 833.04] cleanse in there a cleanse that you
[829.48 - 834.56] don't have to spend $5,000 to do okay I
[833.04 - 836.16] got a cleanse a simple cleanse in there
[834.56 - 837.48] to protect your liver you can do the
[836.16 - 839.12] cleanse periodically and bring your
[837.48 - 842.68] liver back and get your blood to to not
[839.12 - 844.68] be toxic that's what we need to do and
[842.68 - 847.24] that's the power of healing because it's
[844.68 - 849.08] not about having to go and and do this
[847.24 - 850.60] massive you know oh my God I got to do
[849.08 - 851.80] this I got to do that and got to do this
[850.60 - 853.24] it's not about that it's about just
[851.80 - 856.32] doing a few of the right things and it
[853.24 - 858.56] matters it really does so with apple
[856.32 - 862.08] cider vinegar what it does is it pickles
[858.56 - 865.88] the liver there's sodium in our blood
[862.08 - 868.28] there's sodium inside our blood okay and
[865.88 - 871.68] naturally inside our blood our liver
[868.28 - 874.80] harb a larger amount of sodium because
[871.68 - 878.32] our liver is the filter the filter for
[874.80 - 880.20] poor sodium bad sodium that we get in
[878.32 - 883.28] our life all through our life you don't
[880.20 - 885.92] think you you think the salt that you
[883.28 - 888.32] ate on that hot dog or whatever it was
[885.92 - 890.12] in that hot dog 5 years ago you don't
[888.32 - 892.28] think the salt still traces of it aren't
[890.12 - 894.68] still in you somewhere you don't think
[892.28 - 896.32] the salt that you've eaten all these
[894.68 - 897.56] years and all those treats and all that
[896.32 - 899.20] garbage and everything else and I'm not
[897.56 - 901.24] blaming you for that I get it I mean
[899.20 - 903.40] what everybody I I get when why we eat
[901.24 - 905.64] the way we eat and that's not about what
[903.40 - 907.96] the show is about we can do a
[905.64 - 909.76] compassionate show about why we end up
[907.96 - 912.64] eating like we're eating how we're not
[909.76 - 913.88] educated how it's emotional to I I
[912.64 - 916.24] understand all that I talk about that in
[913.88 - 918.28] Liver Rescue in the book Liver Rescue I
[916.24 - 921.00] talk about that in there but I'm talking
[918.28 - 924.32] about you don't think that sodium that
[921.00 - 926.24] sodium that road salt isn't in your body
[924.32 - 927.84] it is it's stored in the liver it's
[926.24 - 929.32] stored in the liver to protect you it's
[927.84 - 931.08] sitting inside the liver the liver
[929.32 - 932.72] actually stores it and then tries to get
[931.08 - 935.60] rid of it and discard it over the years
[932.72 - 938.24] we've compiled so much salt on our in
[935.60 - 940.64] our bodies to and it makes our blood
[938.24 - 942.36] toxic cuz it's not the right kind of
[940.64 - 945.08] sodium like celery juice which makes
[942.36 - 947.40] your blood not toxic it cleans your
[945.08 - 949.76] blood celery juice cleans your blood
[947.40 - 951.32] straight celery juice so what happens is
[949.76 - 954.04] it it actually
[951.32 - 956.44] dismembers dismembers if that's a if
[954.04 - 959.32] that's an okay word to use it it
[956.44 - 961.56] completely dissolves and breaks down and
[959.32 - 964.84] dismembers other salts that have been
[961.56 - 967.36] that won't leave the organs we get
[964.84 - 971.36] salted throughout our life this isn't an
[967.36 - 973.92] anti- salt campaign this isn't a anti
[971.36 - 975.48] salt show you can do a little Himalayan
[973.92 - 977.32] sea salt if you really want here and
[975.48 - 979.08] there for a fun treat you can do a
[977.32 - 981.20] little bit of Celtic Sea salt or
[979.08 - 983.88] something if you you're making a recipe
[981.20 - 986.16] if you really love salt but we've had a
[983.88 - 988.72] lot more salt than that in our lives
[986.16 - 990.80] early on early on from the beginning all
[988.72 - 992.76] the way to now and even though the salt
[990.80 - 994.80] might diminish in the bloodstream it get
[992.76 - 998.20] collects in the organs and it cakes in
[994.80 - 1000.72] the organs it cakes pockets of sodium
[998.20 - 1003.92] pockets of salt end up in the liver and
[1000.72 - 1006.36] in other organs and this starts also the
[1003.92 - 1009.20] process of really dirty blood dirty
[1006.36 - 1011.08] blood in and toxic blood so when you do
[1009.20 - 1012.68] vinegars any kind of vinegars whether
[1011.08 - 1014.24] whatever kind of vinegars all the other
[1012.68 - 1016.24] vinegars are bad they're way bad and
[1014.24 - 1017.88] apple cider vinegar is better but you do
[1016.24 - 1020.00] apple cider vinegar and you're doing a
[1017.88 - 1021.16] lot of it every day a few tablespoons a
[1020.00 - 1022.44] day or you're putting it in your food
[1021.16 - 1023.88] every single day or you're told you
[1022.44 - 1025.68] should be just drinking it every day or
[1023.88 - 1027.32] whatever it is because it's good for
[1025.68 - 1028.96] this good for that you know someone says
[1027.32 - 1030.76] oh it fixed my acid reflux can I tell
[1028.96 - 1033.32] you how many cases of acid reflux it
[1030.76 - 1034.76] caused how about that you there there's
[1033.32 - 1036.64] a percentage of people that fix their
[1034.76 - 1038.80] acid reflux do you know there's a larger
[1036.64 - 1040.12] percentage that it caused acid reflux
[1038.80 - 1041.28] did you know there's a tiny small
[1040.12 - 1043.08] percentage of people it helped their
[1041.28 - 1045.36] bloating did you know there's a massive
[1043.08 - 1048.08] large percentage that it causes bloating
[1045.36 - 1049.60] how about that okay 10 people it gets
[1048.08 - 1050.88] their bloating better or they think they
[1049.60 - 1053.84] got their bloating better from the apple
[1050.88 - 1057.00] cider vinegar 90 people bloat the hell
[1053.84 - 1059.20] up like you can't believe from it it's
[1057.00 - 1062.08] unbelievable
[1059.20 - 1063.56] unbelievable okay 10 people get to get
[1062.08 - 1065.16] their acid reflux a little better by
[1063.56 - 1066.24] actually using Apple set of vinegar even
[1065.16 - 1068.64] though they changed their diet and did
[1066.24 - 1071.76] other things too along with it and then
[1068.64 - 1074.36] 90 people get the worst acid reflux ever
[1071.76 - 1076.44] imaginable from from apple cider vinegar
[1074.36 - 1079.04] I've seen it over and over and hear
[1076.44 - 1081.20] about it over and over and over again
[1079.04 - 1083.04] it's not apple cider vinegar attack it's
[1081.20 - 1084.32] is your blood toxic and I'm talking
[1083.04 - 1086.96] about what's going on when you're doing
[1084.32 - 1089.64] the vinegar what it does is it gets it
[1086.96 - 1092.32] mixes with the Sodium piles from your
[1089.64 - 1094.84] old sodium storage is from Bad salts all
[1092.32 - 1096.68] this time it mixes with it in organs
[1094.84 - 1100.32] such as the liver and it pickles the
[1096.68 - 1103.24] liver it literally pickles it and that's
[1100.32 - 1106.36] what happens it causes a
[1103.24 - 1109.32] pickling literally and you have to
[1106.36 - 1112.20] understand what that does it prunes up
[1109.32 - 1114.60] the organ it puts it under stress
[1112.20 - 1116.92] massive stress makes the organ more
[1114.60 - 1118.48] toxic so apple cider vinegar isn't for a
[1116.92 - 1120.92] cleanse it's not cleansing you it's
[1118.48 - 1123.80] making your blood more toxic is your
[1120.92 - 1126.24] blood toxic yes it is Apple CID V will
[1123.80 - 1128.64] make your blood more toxic I don't care
[1126.24 - 1131.28] if there's pitchforks torches you know
[1128.64 - 1133.64] what I mean the whole bit at the house
[1131.28 - 1134.92] you know I don't care or at my office
[1133.64 - 1136.60] and they're all sitting with pitchforks
[1134.92 - 1138.20] now cuz of apple cider vinegar I don't
[1136.60 - 1139.84] care and I don't care about the trolls
[1138.20 - 1141.04] which which I call clones I don't care
[1139.84 - 1142.88] about the Clones either I call them
[1141.04 - 1144.84] clones cuz it's like gen genetically
[1142.88 - 1146.40] modified people that that are heartless
[1144.84 - 1148.20] and they all talk the same bling
[1146.40 - 1149.88] language so it's unbelievable so and
[1148.20 - 1151.48] troll I like the word troll because I
[1149.88 - 1152.76] think it's a good word so I don't know
[1151.48 - 1153.92] why we have to call you know we have to
[1152.76 - 1155.84] call everybody trolls out there I call
[1153.92 - 1157.44] them clones so I don't care if the
[1155.84 - 1159.44] Clones are upset about Apple CID of
[1157.44 - 1161.48] vinegar and I don't care what it does
[1159.44 - 1163.44] for Apple CID of vinegar sales out there

[1231.28 - 1235.80] all of us naturally even naturally our
[1234.24 - 1237.00] body's already under a load trying to
[1235.80 - 1239.28] process so much we're trying to get
[1237.00 - 1241.32] ammonia out our digestive systems don't
[1239.28 - 1242.76] work good our livers are broken down the
[1241.32 - 1245.40] bile is not strong enough to break down
[1242.76 - 1247.04] the fats and disperse the fats okay our
[1245.40 - 1249.16] hydrochloric acid is not good enough to
[1247.04 - 1250.76] break down proteins everybody's HCL is
[1249.16 - 1252.64] down that's why celery juice is so
[1250.76 - 1255.36] critical important to get you better
[1252.64 - 1257.08] think about that think about that so
[1255.36 - 1258.88] what happens is when food starts rotting
[1257.08 - 1260.80] you get gut rot you get get food rot
[1258.88 - 1262.60] everybody gets his food rot and they're
[1260.80 - 1264.36] dropping proteins in and everything else
[1262.60 - 1266.16] and their food's rotting and ammonia is
[1264.36 - 1268.56] being produced all that ammonia is in
[1266.16 - 1270.16] the blood causing toxic blood and in the
[1268.56 - 1271.92] end it's going to cause cellulite down
[1270.16 - 1273.56] the road if you think you're cellulite
[1271.92 - 1275.88] free and you're never going to get it
[1273.56 - 1277.48] try try again you think you're never
[1275.88 - 1278.92] going to get cellulite because you're 28
[1277.48 - 1280.32] years old and you're you know in shape
[1278.92 - 1281.44] and you're running in the gym and you're

[1287.56 - 1291.00] again you could void all those things
[1289.44 - 1293.20] and that's just one thing I'm talking
[1291.00 - 1294.88] about skin problems I'm talking about
[1293.20 - 1296.00] all kinds of different health problems
[1294.88 - 1297.96] I'm talking about strokes and heart
[1296.00 - 1300.00] attacks I'm talking about everything no
[1297.96 - 1301.64] one's immune but we can protect
[1300.00 - 1304.24] ourselves more than you could ever
[1301.64 - 1307.32] imagine in any way
[1304.24 - 1308.44] possible what happens is HCl lowers no
[1307.32 - 1309.80] matter what kind of shape you think

[1323.68 - 1328.76] blood and it could be literally
[1326.88 - 1330.44] weakening things in your body and that's
[1328.76 - 1331.68] how the blood gets toxic and that's just
[1330.44 - 1333.08] somebody like that what about somebody
[1331.68 - 1334.72] who's viral what about somebody who's
[1333.08 - 1336.00] got the Epstein bar chronic fatigue
[1334.72 - 1337.48] syndrome fibromyalgia they got
[1336.00 - 1339.24] hashimotos thyroiditis they got all
[1337.48 - 1340.80] these other things they got you know all
[1339.24 - 1342.80] tingles and numbness raining in the ears
[1340.80 - 1347.32] tonight's vertigo balance issues aches
[1342.80 - 1348.64] and pains um headaches rashes ecos soras

[1353.36 - 1356.64] different problems that we can have
[1354.92 - 1358.92] floaters in the eyes spots in the eyes
[1356.64 - 1361.24] what about all that's that's toxic blood
[1358.92 - 1362.64] too but that's viral blood that's what
[1361.24 - 1365.00] happens when viruses they release
[1362.64 - 1367.12] neurotoxins and dermat toxins with
[1365.00 - 1368.80] examon orasis it's dermato toxins
[1367.12 - 1370.32] floating to the surface of the skin
[1368.80 - 1372.44] released by The Epstein bar virus
[1370.32 - 1373.60] feeding off of copper this is I'm going
[1372.44 - 1375.72] really quick cuz there's so much
[1373.60 - 1378.00] information to deliver so make sure you
[1375.72 - 1380.24] listen to the show more than once so you
[1378.00 - 1382.52] don't miss this exos psoriasis and what
[1380.24 - 1384.44] it is and that's the that's a virus
[1382.52 - 1386.40] inside the liver feeding off of copper
[1384.44 - 1388.48] creating dirty blood creating toxic
[1386.40 - 1390.28] Blood by releasing poisons inside the
[1388.48 - 1393.64] bloodstream called dermato toxins that
[1390.28 - 1396.96] will surface to the skin and cause
[1393.64 - 1399.20] rashes like eoris rosace and so forth
[1396.96 - 1401.92] that's what that is but that's toxic
[1399.20 - 1403.80] blood once again so the thing is with
[1401.92 - 1405.76] Liver Rescue whether it's anything
[1403.80 - 1407.56] that's viral or not viral and it's just

[1466.08 - 1471.60] so anyway with 30 blood and toxic blood
[1469.12 - 1473.68] it's not just about detox detox detox
[1471.60 - 1474.80] detox and it's not just about Talking
[1473.68 - 1476.20] Heads out there and the so-called
[1474.80 - 1477.96] experts in the detox world they're like
[1476.20 - 1479.60] oh you got to detox oh you got to detox
[1477.96 - 1481.36] it's more than that it's all these
[1479.60 - 1483.20] things I'm telling you no one knows
[1481.36 - 1484.60] about the salt that's compiled inside
[1483.20 - 1486.36] the liver that's been there for years
[1484.60 - 1487.76] and years and years from hot dogs you've
[1486.36 - 1489.24] eaten a long time ago and everything
[1487.76 - 1491.24] else that you've eaten and whatever I
[1489.24 - 1493.56] mean you could just damn it Pizza what
[1491.24 - 1495.96] everything it has all that bad salt do
[1493.56 - 1498.80] you think that salt just disappeared it
[1495.96 - 1501.00] disappeared out of the bloodstream
[1498.80 - 1502.80] it did but it stayed compacted in the
[1501.00 - 1504.28] organs and then when you do like
[1502.80 - 1508.08] vinegars of any kinds you actually
[1504.28 - 1511.28] pickle organs and you age rapidly you
[1508.08 - 1513.36] actually age rapidly and that's what
[1511.28 - 1515.92] happens but you can get those toxic
[1513.36 - 1517.72] salts out by using celery juice and
[1515.92 - 1520.00] things of anything with skin problems
[1517.72 - 1521.48] anything like exam psoriasis hives any
[1520.00 - 1523.64] kind of thing that happens with the skin
[1521.48 - 1526.12] too peeling in the hands peeling in the
[1523.64 - 1527.92] feet all kinds of skin issues you can
[1526.12 - 1530.24] celery juice literally can help by
[1527.92 - 1531.92] actually removing dermat toxins and tox
[1530.24 - 1533.64] and viral toxins out of the blood to try
[1531.92 - 1535.40] to get you better the blood is filled
[1533.64 - 1537.24] with so many things that's not seen by
[1535.40 - 1538.96] research and science they can't see
[1537.24 - 1540.64] anything in the blood you know what's
[1538.96 - 1543.32] really annoying you guys is they will
[1540.64 - 1545.44] take so much blood from you do you know
[1543.32 - 1547.88] how much blood they throw away you
[1545.44 - 1550.48] wouldn't believe it when they pull vials
[1547.88 - 1553.20] I run into this all the time the blood
[1550.48 - 1556.20] labs are they're literally criminal in
[1553.20 - 1558.80] my opinion because they they they demand
[1556.20 - 1560.84] so much blood I've seen people get
[1558.80 - 1562.32] sicker because they had 15 vials of
[1560.84 - 1564.12] blood taken out you know people with
[1562.32 - 1566.88] chronic fatigue syndrome what happens is
[1564.12 - 1570.52] when you get all that blood removed it
[1566.88 - 1572.96] removes your immune system and then how
[1570.52 - 1574.52] it doesn't remove the viruses that are
[1572.96 - 1576.72] that are hurting people so you got the
[1574.52 - 1578.52] worst CFS M you got chronic fatigue
[1576.72 - 1580.52] syndrome you got fibromyalgia whatever
[1578.52 - 1582.36] it is you got fatigue you got you you
[1580.52 - 1583.76] know aches and pains you're your body's
[1582.36 - 1585.56] burning up you got all kinds of
[1583.76 - 1587.04] different burning on your body you got
[1585.56 - 1588.76] rashes you got whatever it is you're
[1587.04 - 1590.72] dealing with you got you can't think you
[1588.76 - 1592.24] got the worst brain fog possible you got
[1590.72 - 1593.36] so-called Lyme disease or whatever it is
[1592.24 - 1595.72] that's going on or whatever you're
[1593.36 - 1598.28] diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and
[1595.72 - 1600.92] what do they do I'm talking so fast my
[1598.28 - 1602.92] voice is getting dry what do they do
[1600.92 - 1605.08] they they extract too much blood from
[1602.92 - 1606.96] people that are sick I see it happen all
[1605.08 - 1609.72] the time what I've always told clients
[1606.96 - 1611.68] no no no no no you give them four five
[1609.72 - 1613.64] five vials at a time you give them three
[1611.68 - 1615.88] vials it's it's their problem they're
[1613.64 - 1619.16] Throwing It All Away they throw it all
[1615.88 - 1622.28] away they throw it all away they remove
[1619.16 - 1623.80] your immune system they literally remove
[1622.28 - 1625.88] your immune system you'll never hear
[1623.80 - 1627.84] this anywhere that's the whole point
[1625.88 - 1629.52] you'll never hear it anywhere else
[1627.84 - 1632.24] you'll never hear the truth about things
[1629.52 - 1634.28] anywhere else and listen I know a lot of
[1632.24 - 1636.00] Physicians and I know a lot of experts I
[1634.28 - 1637.04] know a lot of science people I know a
[1636.00 - 1638.72] lot of people in science I know
[1637.04 - 1641.04] geneticists I know so many people in the
[1638.72 - 1643.16] field of medicine and people say to me
[1641.04 - 1645.40] they say like things like it's amazing
[1643.16 - 1646.88] what they say to me they'll say how do
[1645.40 - 1649.12] you know what how it works how do you
[1646.88 - 1651.36] know which way work you don't know any
[1649.12 - 1653.24] doctors or anything are you kidding me
[1651.36 - 1655.84] are are you kidding me I mean just I
[1653.24 - 1658.28] mean it's unbelievable and and yeah I do
[1655.84 - 1660.64] and the thing is is this is that is that
[1658.28 - 1662.92] I know a lot of people in the field that
[1660.64 - 1664.76] are even above the regular thing that's
[1662.92 - 1666.32] going on so when you go to your doctor I
[1664.76 - 1668.88] know people that are that are actually
[1666.32 - 1670.08] in the system of the medical field that
[1668.88 - 1671.68] tell me and they say you know what
[1670.08 - 1674.32] you're 100% right about how the blood
[1671.68 - 1676.60] Labs work this is what they do this is
[1674.32 - 1678.52] what they do they they take all this
[1676.60 - 1680.60] blood they use a Speck of it and they
[1678.52 - 1683.12] literally throw away your blood they
[1680.60 - 1685.68] throw away your blood it's unbelievable
[1683.12 - 1688.12] and when they screen blood it's it's the
[1685.68 - 1690.64] system is so flawed the way they screen
[1688.12 - 1693.04] it and how much they waste and what
[1690.64 - 1696.32] happens is when they pull it out like
[1693.04 - 1699.04] that you get more toxic so when you're
[1696.32 - 1701.24] sick they're actually killing you slowly
[1699.04 - 1704.04] that's the irony because you get more
[1701.24 - 1705.72] toxic and more viral because what they
[1704.04 - 1708.28] do is when they pull that much blood out
[1705.72 - 1710.36] they're pulling out your immune system
[1708.28 - 1712.60] your white count they're just ripping it
[1710.36 - 1714.28] out it's in your blood it's hard for
[1712.60 - 1715.48] people to produce that when they're sick
[1714.28 - 1717.60] when they're that sick and they're that
[1715.48 - 1720.20] Viral with lupus Lyme disease multiple
[1717.60 - 1722.76] sclerosis Hashimoto fatigue cry fatigue
[1720.20 - 1724.96] fibromyalgia scaros all these different
[1722.76 - 1727.68] things whatever they're dealing with all
[1724.96 - 1729.00] these different illnesses and different
[1727.68 - 1730.28] situations and they're going to the
[1729.00 - 1731.88] doctor and they're getting all pulled
[1730.28 - 1733.20] out of them and then you go to these
[1731.88 - 1734.52] functional medicine doctors which I
[1733.20 - 1736.80] still love too but you go to these
[1734.52 - 1740.24] functional medicine doctors and they're
[1736.80 - 1741.84] pulling out 25 vials 20 vials it's all
[1740.24 - 1743.56] being thrown away cuz the labs are
[1741.84 - 1745.16] throwing it away and then what's
[1743.56 - 1747.56] happening your whole blood your all your
[1745.16 - 1749.08] white count is being removed and then
[1747.56 - 1750.80] and what's happening the viruses aren't
[1749.08 - 1752.56] being removed and then there's less
[1750.80 - 1754.44] white count to stop your viruses and
[1752.56 - 1755.96] people get sicker and sicker and sicker
[1754.44 - 1757.20] with Lyme disease and their lime doctors
[1755.96 - 1758.80] are pulling all this blood out of them
[1757.20 - 1760.56] they're getting sicker and sicker and
[1758.80 - 1762.16] sicker that's how it works and then they
[1760.56 - 1763.56] get thrown antibiotics in them even
[1762.16 - 1764.76] though they get thrown also herbs and
[1763.56 - 1766.32] even though they get thrown natural
[1764.76 - 1768.12] stuff and diet they also get throwing
[1766.32 - 1769.44] antibiotics in them and then that makes
[1768.12 - 1771.28] them sicker and sicker and their blood
[1769.44 - 1773.12] more toxic I've seen this over and over
[1771.28 - 1775.48] again that's just lime I'm talking about
[1773.12 - 1777.72] all kinds of different things and so
[1775.48 - 1779.76] what happens is when you're sick your
[1777.72 - 1781.96] blood can even get more toxic when
[1779.76 - 1783.72] you're not sick your blood's still toxic
[1781.96 - 1786.16] and science and research doesn't have a
[1783.72 - 1787.80] clue as to far as far as what kind of
[1786.16 - 1790.24] petrochemicals are floating in the blood
[1787.80 - 1791.40] all day long what kind of diesel fumes
[1790.24 - 1793.12] you just breathe in when you were on
[1791.40 - 1794.64] your bicycle on the road you know like
[1793.12 - 1796.32] riding your bicycle and somebody drove
[1794.64 - 1797.60] by and all that petrochemical went
[1796.32 - 1798.92] inside your bloodstream and it's sits in
[1797.60 - 1801.36] there for 2 weeks and then goes inside
[1798.92 - 1802.44] your liver no one talks about that or
[1801.36 - 1804.64] how about that when you're in college
[1802.44 - 1806.08] and you paint at your dorm room and and
[1804.64 - 1807.28] and you Splash pain on yourself and
[1806.08 - 1808.80] everything and it's all sitting inside
[1807.28 - 1810.80] the liver and it still keeps your blood
[1808.80 - 1812.48] toxic every single day as you're getting
[1810.80 - 1814.28] older and you age faster then you get
[1812.48 - 1815.64] the hot flashes then you get the viral
[1814.28 - 1817.08] issues and the hot flashes and the
[1815.64 - 1818.36] weight gain and nobody knows why you're
[1817.08 - 1820.44] getting the weight gain and your blood's
[1818.36 - 1822.12] toxic they can draw blood they can't see
[1820.44 - 1823.88] the toxins it doesn't you know it's
[1822.12 - 1825.40] unbelievable that's how flawed the whole
[1823.88 - 1827.28] system is and that's how behind we are
[1825.40 - 1829.16] with health even the most advanced Al
[1827.28 - 1830.64] Alternative Health is dogging it's so
[1829.16 - 1832.44] bad it's painful when it comes down to
[1830.64 - 1834.44] chronic illness but yes science and
[1832.44 - 1835.96] research can send some amazing rocket
[1834.44 - 1837.76] ships in in their sending rocket ships
[1835.96 - 1839.84] in space even though they're antiques
[1837.76 - 1841.44] compared to what's coming in the future
[1839.84 - 1842.76] but still they can send them into space
[1841.44 - 1844.84] they can remove aneurysms out of
[1842.76 - 1847.08] people's brains they got robots now I I
[1844.84 - 1850.00] know a neurosurgeon that actually uses
[1847.08 - 1852.96] he uses a mechanism he controls a
[1850.00 - 1856.24] mechanism to carefully carefully pull
[1852.96 - 1858.24] out like remove an aneurysm it's it's
[1856.24 - 1859.64] unbelievable and that's science and
[1858.24 - 1861.12] research in a good way life-saving
[1859.64 - 1862.44] medicine stuff like that sure but in
[1861.12 - 1864.48] chronic illness it's absolutely
[1862.44 - 1867.80] disastrous and toxic blood not being
[1864.48 - 1869.40] recognized like toxic blood not being
[1867.80 - 1871.20] recognized dirty blood not being
[1869.40 - 1873.32] recognized is one of the big mistakes
[1871.20 - 1876.12] and in throwing blood away in all the
[1873.32 - 1878.24] patience is another terrible mistake
[1876.12 - 1881.80] when will that get fixed probably not in
[1878.24 - 1883.28] my lifetime not in my lifetime that's
[1881.80 - 1886.04] never going to get fixed but I tell
[1883.28 - 1887.88] clients you give them three to five
[1886.04 - 1890.84] vials the most
[1887.88 - 1893.32] at a time you go back and you have them
[1890.84 - 1895.56] do different tests then and do another
[1893.32 - 1899.16] three vials and let them throw away your
[1895.56 - 1901.16] blood carefully let them throw it away
[1899.16 - 1903.44] carefully so your white blood count
[1901.16 - 1905.68] doesn't diminish to such a degree that
[1903.44 - 1907.76] you get more viral and more sick and
[1905.68 - 1909.76] your strep comes out and and annihilates
[1907.76 - 1912.68] you and your the Epstein bar comes out
[1909.76 - 1914.68] and your hhv6 comes out and your simplex
[1912.68 - 1916.00] one comes out and starts screwing you up
[1914.68 - 1918.52] and getting into your nervous system
[1916.00 - 1921.76] causing more problems with your nerves
[1918.52 - 1923.36] and so it's important it's really
[1921.76 - 1924.72] important to know that you can protect
[1923.36 - 1926.64] yourself because your blood could get
[1924.72 - 1928.72] more toxic when you're sick just from
[1926.64 - 1930.64] regular standard medical practices it's
[1928.72 - 1932.40] just a little tidbit to try to help you
[1930.64 - 1935.40] along with this
[1932.40 - 1937.00] so how do we allow toxins that are in
[1935.40 - 1940.08] our blood all the different things I
[1937.00 - 1941.96] said that are in our blood from you know
[1940.08 - 1943.88] cooking on a gas grill from being at a
[1941.96 - 1945.76] bombfire one day with all that treat at
[1943.88 - 1949.08] wood being burned and going into your
[1945.76 - 1950.56] lungs you know all of that all of that
[1949.08 - 1952.32] or being you know Somewhere over the
[1950.56 - 1955.12] summer and there's just a pile of wood
[1952.32 - 1956.36] burning a massive pile of wood burning
[1955.12 - 1957.68] and you're you're out there and you're
[1956.36 - 1958.88] just you know you're partying or
[1957.68 - 1961.52] something like that and it's just like
[1958.88 - 1963.96] you're breathing in so much of this
[1961.52 - 1965.44] stuff and and you know what I mean and I
[1963.96 - 1967.56] don't like that whole thing ah you can't
[1965.44 - 1969.60] live forever hey your immune system has
[1967.56 - 1971.32] to deal with it you said The more stuff
[1969.60 - 1973.08] you throw at yourself the more it builds
[1971.32 - 1975.08] you up it makes you stronger it doesn't
[1973.08 - 1977.96] work like that that's the biggest croc
[1975.08 - 1980.64] that's the biggest pile of of you know
[1977.96 - 1984.28] what I've ever heard it doesn't work
[1980.64 - 1986.76] like that you age faster stuff happens
[1984.28 - 1988.36] in your life organs start you know you
[1986.76 - 1989.84] start oh wait a minute what my I have
[1988.36 - 1991.24] kidney problems you next thing know
[1989.84 - 1992.64] you're 38 years old what do you mean
[1991.24 - 1994.44] doctor I actually have kidney problems
[1992.64 - 1996.84] is that what this is It's I have to go
[1994.44 - 1998.72] on dialysis it's like it's like it's
[1996.84 - 2002.12] like there's reasons for all of this we
[1998.72 - 2005.96] have to keep our blood clean and we have
[2002.12 - 2008.88] to protect our livers and get them
[2005.96 - 2010.44] clean and so and and clean up our
[2008.88 - 2012.20] viruses clean up all the other things
[2010.44 - 2013.84] that's inside our body the irony is
[2012.20 - 2015.56] people don't even know they're viral
[2013.84 - 2016.88] they just have symptoms and they're like
[2015.56 - 2018.08] well I don't know I just have I have
[2016.88 - 2020.32] these symptoms they don't even know
[2018.08 - 2022.44] they're viral like well I have these I
[2020.32 - 2024.44] have this vertigo I had it and I went to
[2022.44 - 2027.60] my chiropractor and my chiropractor
[2024.44 - 2029.48] didn't know what it was and it's viral
[2027.60 - 2033.56] any kind any kind of vertigo is that's
[2029.48 - 2035.68] what it is 100% viral and so it's it's
[2033.56 - 2037.68] one of these things where you know
[2035.68 - 2039.96] people don't even know they're walking
[2037.68 - 2042.20] around oh I'm tired I'm fatigued yeah
[2039.96 - 2044.16] it's viral and know they don't even know
[2042.20 - 2045.60] these things it's amazing how it works
[2044.16 - 2048.08] but it's it's important to know what's
[2045.60 - 2050.28] going on with you so back to toxic blood
[2048.08 - 2053.92] back to the whole thing about how we
[2050.28 - 2055.88] don't know how toxic it is our bile
[2053.92 - 2058.56] coming out of our liver is filled with
[2055.88 - 2060.00] poison filled with poison so if we don't
[2058.56 - 2062.60] take care of our livers and clean them
[2060.00 - 2064.20] up the bile itself is filled with poison
[2062.60 - 2066.08] and it goes into the Gove ladder and
[2064.20 - 2067.80] that's how stones are produced they're
[2066.08 - 2069.64] produced because of the amount of poison
[2067.80 - 2071.48] that we have that our liers collecting
[2069.64 - 2073.52] all the time someone said to me how does
[2071.48 - 2076.36] a gall stone start it starts with you
[2073.52 - 2078.76] being having toxic blood for many years
[2076.36 - 2081.32] eating the wrong things getting exposure
[2078.76 - 2083.92] to all the wrong things and then the
[2081.32 - 2085.88] liver having to process all this and try
[2083.92 - 2088.12] to get it out in some way and detox it
[2085.88 - 2090.64] out sends it up the bile duct into your
[2088.12 - 2092.48] gallbladder and it forms stones and it
[2090.64 - 2094.40] also goes into your digestive tract all
[2092.48 - 2096.56] the time into your digestive tract the
[2094.40 - 2099.08] poison goes in there all the all the
[2096.56 - 2101.96] different stuff all the different stuff
[2099.08 - 2104.08] and if it's poison if it's poison such
[2101.96 - 2105.40] as like dermatoxin from an Epstein bar
[2104.08 - 2106.44] and having copper in the liver then it
[2105.40 - 2109.92] becomes
[2106.44 - 2111.80] rosacea see that's how it works science
[2109.92 - 2113.04] of research has no idea how what rosacea
[2111.80 - 2114.60] even is they they don't even know what
[2113.04 - 2116.56] causes it what's going on they're just
[2114.60 - 2119.40] right now they're they're in the mode of
[2116.56 - 2121.80] blaming everything on their safe fault
[2119.40 - 2123.32] it's the safe fault is which is bait and
[2121.80 - 2125.92] switch or safe fault whatever you want
[2123.32 - 2128.92] to say it's it's your body attacking
[2125.92 - 2131.32] itself it's your fault and science and
[2128.92 - 2133.32] research is going to figure out ways of
[2131.32 - 2135.16] trying to stop your body from attacking
[2133.32 - 2137.44] itself and we're going to study more
[2135.16 - 2138.60] genes because it must be your genes too
[2137.44 - 2140.64] these are the two things you're holding
[2138.60 - 2143.00] on to so that people with chronic
[2140.64 - 2145.32] illness get sicker and sicker and sicker
[2143.00 - 2146.76] and sicker instead of getting down to
[2145.32 - 2148.56] the bottom of everything and what's
[2146.76 - 2150.64] really happening instead of getting down
[2148.56 - 2153.12] to the bottom of what's really going on
[2150.64 - 2155.52] and what you need to do so we live our
[2153.12 - 2158.48] life we eat all the wrong Foods our
[2155.52 - 2160.84] liver gets totally filled up with so
[2158.48 - 2162.40] much poison and toxin completely filled
[2160.84 - 2164.80] up with so much poison and toxin that's
[2162.40 - 2168.44] what our liver does so that's all
[2164.80 - 2170.36] happening so we're aging faster okay and
[2168.44 - 2173.00] then we get the viral issues that we all
[2170.36 - 2174.56] have the viruses that get into everybody
[2173.00 - 2177.96] in so many different ways and the
[2174.56 - 2179.52] bacteria that gets in UTI UTI is a strep
[2177.96 - 2181.44] that means you have strep in your system
[2179.52 - 2183.68] sibo that's strep in your system I talk
[2181.44 - 2186.84] all about this in Liver Rescue if these
[2183.68 - 2189.56] are just Prime examples in 10 years
[2186.84 - 2191.20] every single person young adults mostly
[2189.56 - 2193.32] women young women are going to be all
[2191.20 - 2195.68] diagnosed with sibo all diagnosed with
[2193.32 - 2196.68] sibo in the next coming 10 years all of
[2195.68 - 2197.76] them they're all going to be going to
[2196.68 - 2199.36] the doctors they're all going to be
[2197.76 - 2201.44] going to even conventional doctors they
[2199.36 - 2202.96] be diagnosed with with a small
[2201.44 - 2204.12] intestinal overgrowth back bacterial
[2202.96 - 2206.00] overgrowth and they're going to be
[2204.12 - 2207.52] diagnosed with sibo that's all strep in
[2206.00 - 2209.04] the gut still to this day science
[2207.52 - 2212.36] research doesn't know it's strep but
[2209.04 - 2215.24] it's actually strep and so we have all
[2212.36 - 2217.52] these things they're producing toxins we
[2215.24 - 2219.00] have old salts inside of us caked in
[2217.52 - 2221.04] there we got other poisons
[2219.00 - 2223.44] petrochemicals we got Plastics that are
[2221.04 - 2226.04] inside of us we got Pharmaceuticals
[2223.44 - 2228.28] inside our liver inside our brain inside
[2226.04 - 2231.36] our body in different places it builds
[2228.28 - 2234.80] up it builds up it builds up and then
[2231.36 - 2237.48] then in many women in most women it's
[2234.80 - 2240.20] blamed on menopause all the symptoms
[2237.48 - 2242.72] when it's not menopause all the symptoms
[2240.20 - 2244.60] that's toxic blood that's occurring
[2242.72 - 2247.08] that's the liver being toxic with
[2244.60 - 2249.80] viruses such as Epstein bar toxins and
[2247.08 - 2252.72] poisons that built up for years decades
[2249.80 - 2255.60] from Bad suntan lotions okay from Bad
[2252.72 - 2258.12] perfumes from Bad lotions from bad colog
[2255.60 - 2261.04] from from anything from Hairspray
[2258.12 - 2262.68] whatever it is built up over the years
[2261.04 - 2264.36] and and that's just some things that's
[2262.68 - 2266.04] not even the foods and the chemicals
[2264.36 - 2268.52] that are in foods and preservatives it's
[2266.04 - 2270.32] all in the liver it's all in the blood
[2268.52 - 2272.36] the blood gets toxic and then you start
[2270.32 - 2273.92] getting around 35 38 years old and many
[2272.36 - 2275.76] women it's a lot earlier now they're all
[2273.92 - 2278.44] Expos they're all experiencing menopause
[2275.76 - 2280.80] symptoms like just earlier it's not
[2278.44 - 2283.12] menopause it's the hot flashes it's the
[2280.80 - 2285.68] liver being toxic it's the it's all of
[2283.12 - 2287.96] that heart palpitations the liver being
[2285.68 - 2291.64] toxic with viruses releasing poison
[2287.96 - 2294.40] going into the heart and creating heart
[2291.64 - 2297.00] palpitations that's how it works but
[2294.40 - 2299.28] toxic blood is the heart palpitations
[2297.00 - 2301.00] the toxic blood it's it's all of that I
[2299.28 - 2303.28] mean that's how that's how the hot
[2301.00 - 2304.68] flashes and it's blamed on hormones so
[2303.28 - 2306.16] then they're given steroids which are
[2304.68 - 2308.28] hormones they give steroids to try to
[2306.16 - 2311.20] calm the symptoms down and make
[2308.28 - 2313.68] everybody happy it's unbelievable where
[2311.20 - 2315.12] we're at we're so behind it is
[2313.68 - 2316.80] unbelievable you want to know more about
[2315.12 - 2320.60] any of this just get the medical medium
[2316.80 - 2322.28] series get the books get the books and
[2320.60 - 2324.40] like I say I say it over and over again
[2322.28 - 2325.92] just go to the library cuz I don't care
[2324.40 - 2328.80] I don't care if someone buys the book or
[2325.92 - 2330.64] not I care about them having the book

[2337.12 - 2341.88] I mean you're worth it you're worth
[2338.84 - 2344.32] knowing what to do and so this toxic
[2341.88 - 2346.88] blood carries us out through our
[2344.32 - 2349.64] lifetime through our lifetime and if
[2346.88 - 2352.60] we're more viral then we get sick early
[2349.64 - 2355.00] and toxic blood happening like all of it
[2352.60 - 2357.44] together compiled together and the liver
[2355.00 - 2359.96] gets overloaded with viruses overloaded
[2357.44 - 2361.72] with toxins and metals so what do we do
[2359.96 - 2363.52] what are some things to help get rid of
[2361.72 - 2365.24] toxic blood one is is the heavy metal
[2363.52 - 2366.76] detox smoothie so the medical medium

[2402.96 - 2406.28] pharmaceuticals which have metal in it
[2404.60 - 2407.76] all the exposures of petrochemicals that
[2406.28 - 2409.80] you're Brea in every day that have metal

[2434.68 - 2438.56] meanwhile I have on my Instagram feed
[2436.80 - 2440.84] there's babies that are drinking a whole
[2438.56 - 2442.48] glass of celery juice like they're 6
[2440.84 - 2444.24] months old and they're holding and
[2442.48 - 2445.44] they're holding a glass of celery juice
[2444.24 - 2447.24] and they're gobbling it down and
[2445.44 - 2448.72] drinking it down and they're smiling and
[2447.24 - 2451.16] laughing and they're they're actually
[2448.72 - 2454.16] getting celery juice in in them so when
[2451.16 - 2456.48] I hear when I hear adults that are 40 50
[2454.16 - 2458.28] years old and they're like they they
[2456.48 - 2460.12] they they they don't like the taste and
[2458.28 - 2461.60] they go I just can't drink this I can't
[2460.12 - 2463.36] drink The Taste and these are little
[2461.60 - 2465.92] babies there's one-year-olds drinking
[2463.36 - 2468.04] celery juice every day but that's that's
[2465.92 - 2469.84] not all all across the country and
[2468.04 - 2471.76] around the globe and the people that
[2469.84 - 2472.88] have the medical medium book series
[2471.76 - 2474.52] they're they're they're little kids
[2472.88 - 2476.44] they're one-year-old they're 2-year-olds
[2474.52 - 2479.20] are drinking celery juice and they're
[2476.44 - 2480.72] all drinking celery juice and and so I
[2479.20 - 2482.76] got these 40 and 50y olds that they're
[2480.72 - 2484.76] like I I can't drink the 2 ounces it
[2482.76 - 2487.28] make kind of makes me doesn't feel good
[2484.76 - 2490.32] and like it's like come on get get it in
[2487.28 - 2493.28] you and just get it in you it's amazing
[2490.32 - 2496.64] how the mind works get it in you and
[2493.28 - 2498.20] work on healing really unless unless you
[2496.64 - 2499.80] just have an inversion to it it's a
[2498.20 - 2500.84] horrible inversion to it where you're
[2499.80 - 2502.52] some kind of like you going into
[2500.84 - 2504.48] athlectic shock or something I mean
[2502.52 - 2505.88] something like you know something
[2504.48 - 2506.96] happens like that if you're if your
[2505.88 - 2509.72] doctor tells you you're allergic to
[2506.96 - 2511.64] celery then don't then yeah I don't I
[2509.72 - 2514.12] mean like a real allergic reaction not
[2511.64 - 2515.32] not like going to get like a going to
[2514.12 - 2516.72] like getting you know the whole thing
[2515.32 - 2518.28] with your mapping out your food and
[2516.72 - 2520.32] you're doing food elimination things and
[2518.28 - 2523.44] you're doing food uh food sensitivity
[2520.32 - 2525.40] food sensitivity testing and celeries on
[2523.44 - 2526.96] the list but it it doesn't bother you
[2525.40 - 2528.88] but it's on the list don't get fooled by
[2526.96 - 2530.52] that that that's all a mess that's all a
[2528.88 - 2533.32] hot mess that whole food sensitivity
[2530.52 - 2535.28] thing make sure you're doing celery and
[2533.32 - 2537.08] with celery juice so that's another
[2535.28 - 2539.88] thing celery juice will go into the
[2537.08 - 2541.84] liver start to loosen up old old
[2539.88 - 2544.20] compacted cake salt so that if you do
[2541.84 - 2547.16] have apple cider vinegar you won't cook
[2544.20 - 2549.32] your liver you won't salt you won't
[2547.16 - 2551.36] pickle your liver and prune it up and
[2549.32 - 2552.48] damage it I'm not saying do the apple
[2551.36 - 2554.20] cider vinegar I'm just saying so you
[2552.48 - 2556.32] want to do the celery juice you want to
[2554.20 - 2558.12] clean that up and you want to clean up
[2556.32 - 2560.00] the blood cucumber juice if you really
[2558.12 - 2561.36] can't do celery juice do cucumber juice
[2560.00 - 2562.88] that will help also with the blood it
[2561.36 - 2565.28] helped actually helps to get the blood
[2562.88 - 2568.08] less toxic cleans up the blood lemon
[2565.28 - 2570.56] water every single morning lemon water
[2568.08 - 2573.16] every single morning okay that's why we
[2570.56 - 2575.44] put it on the map people did lemon water
[2573.16 - 2577.56] I I'm not the I'm not the beginner I'm
[2575.44 - 2578.88] not the beginning source of lemon water
[2577.56 - 2580.28] I'm going to tell you right now I'm the
[2578.88 - 2581.72] beginning source of celery juice
[2580.28 - 2583.84] straight celery juice I'm not the
[2581.72 - 2585.84] beginning source of lemon water but
[2583.84 - 2587.88] we've definitely mov the needle on Lemon
[2585.84 - 2589.84] Water people are doing it it's a
[2587.88 - 2591.32] definitely become a main staple out
[2589.84 - 2593.44] there which is incredible make sure
[2591.32 - 2595.96] you're doing the lemon water that's
[2593.44 - 2597.48] absolutely the that's what you do I mean
[2595.96 - 2599.72] I've been doing lemon water since I was
[2597.48 - 2602.24] four years old but you know it's a long
[2599.72 - 2603.52] time ago but it's been around it's been
[2602.24 - 2606.76] around for a long time and they were
[2603.52 - 2608.60] doing lemon water in Italy long long ago
[2606.76 - 2610.36] squeezing lemon and water adding a
[2608.60 - 2611.92] little honey if you want to add a little
[2610.36 - 2613.16] honey if that's what you want to do
[2611.92 - 2614.56] that's the only way you can get that
[2613.16 - 2617.48] lemon water in you then add a little
[2614.56 - 2620.00] honey I'm okay with that and so the
[2617.48 - 2621.52] whole deal is is that it's about getting
[2620.00 - 2622.92] the blood less toxic so you want the
[2621.52 - 2624.32] lemon water every morning you want your
[2622.92 - 2626.48] celery juice you want your heavy metal
[2624.32 - 2628.76] detox smoothie if that's all you can do
[2626.48 - 2630.92] and the rest is whatever you're doing
[2628.76 - 2632.88] the rest is whatever not so good food
[2630.92 - 2634.80] choices or not so good whatever then
[2632.88 - 2636.64] that's all you can do I'm totally on
[2634.80 - 2638.64] board with that but but it's going to
[2636.64 - 2640.48] help so you don't get dark circles under
[2638.64 - 2642.32] your eyes so you don't get varicose
[2640.48 - 2645.12] veins and spider veins on your body so
[2642.32 - 2647.12] you don't get cellulite on your body so
[2645.12 - 2650.44] you don't get weight gain because your
[2647.12 - 2652.96] liver getting so tired and so inflamed
[2650.44 - 2654.64] and from so many poisons and and toxins
[2652.96 - 2656.84] in your liver that are never being
[2654.64 - 2659.00] cleansed or cleaned out and viruses and
[2656.84 - 2660.80] bacteria so the weight gain happens it
[2659.00 - 2662.64] hits everybody and their weight starts
[2660.80 - 2665.16] coming on their weight just starts
[2662.64 - 2667.64] pouring on it hits everybody it's so you
[2665.16 - 2669.76] don't get any of that too so you stay
[2667.64 - 2672.44] away from all that weight gain that's
[2669.76 - 2675.36] another thing too getting your toxic
[2672.44 - 2677.68] blood cleaned up gets weight problems
[2675.36 - 2680.16] behind you it gets you in a better place
[2677.68 - 2682.00] so you can lose weight and start healing
[2680.16 - 2684.40] because viruses won't be able to pollute
[2682.00 - 2686.84] your liver so much they won't be able to
[2684.40 - 2688.08] affect you so much and in Liver Rescue I
[2686.84 - 2689.44] talk about all the different supplements
[2688.08 - 2691.04] and things you can do for viruses and
[2689.44 - 2694.52] all the different conditions you know
[2691.04 - 2696.36] that people have but the thing is is you
[2694.52 - 2698.68] this is the big start of getting your
[2696.36 - 2701.28] blood less toxic the other big start is
[2698.68 - 2703.52] lower your fats lower your fats and do
[2701.28 - 2705.84] not listen to the trend out there when
[2703.52 - 2708.12] they tell you when they tell you protein
[2705.84 - 2710.08] protein protein they're telling you fat
[2708.12 - 2712.32] fat fat fat fat that's what they're
[2710.08 - 2714.56] telling you so be careful so if you're
[2712.32 - 2715.92] totally into animal protein reduce it
[2714.56 - 2717.60] I'm not saying get rid of it if you
[2715.92 - 2718.88] don't want to get rid of it fine I'm not
[2717.60 - 2721.08] I'm not against it I'm not against
[2718.88 - 2723.36] animal protein you but reduce it if
[2721.08 - 2724.80] you're if you're if you're plant-based
[2723.36 - 2726.48] or you call yourself vegan or whatever
[2724.80 - 2728.76] it is you're plant-based
[2726.48 - 2731.04] then reduce your nuts and seeds lower
[2728.76 - 2733.36] the fats reduce any oils reduce nuts and
[2731.04 - 2735.00] seeds cut your avocado down to size a
[2733.36 - 2737.92] little bit cut your tahini down a little
[2735.00 - 2739.40] bit cut your cashews down cut them down
[2737.92 - 2741.28] so you can lower your fat because what
[2739.40 - 2743.20] happens is the higher the fat levels you
[2741.28 - 2744.92] have in your bloodstream the more toxic
[2743.20 - 2748.92] your blood stays remember that your
[2744.92 - 2752.44] blood will stay toxic so much
[2748.92 - 2755.08] longer so much longer the fat suspends
[2752.44 - 2757.16] the toxins it suspends it it doesn't
[2755.08 - 2759.40] even let it leave the kidneys it doesn't
[2757.16 - 2761.36] even let it leave the body and these
[2759.40 - 2764.12] high protein diets whether they're vegan
[2761.36 - 2766.40] high protein whether they're animal you
[2764.12 - 2768.92] know high protein paleo high protein
[2766.40 - 2770.32] they're high fat for God's sakes and you
[2768.92 - 2772.08] know what happens in the end heart
[2770.32 - 2774.36] disease cardiovascular disease down the
[2772.08 - 2776.60] road problems everywhere even if it's
[2774.36 - 2779.60] healthy fats you get problems too much
[2776.60 - 2782.04] fat harms the liver causes it to get
[2779.60 - 2784.64] congested causes the heart to have to
[2782.04 - 2787.12] work harder the more fat in your
[2784.64 - 2790.04] bloodstream the harder your part heart
[2787.12 - 2792.96] has to work to draw that blood through
[2790.04 - 2795.28] it tires it out for down the road and I
[2792.96 - 2796.52] don't care if you're exercising every
[2795.28 - 2797.96] day and you're taking care of yourself
[2796.52 - 2799.72] on that level and you're in shape and
[2797.96 - 2801.68] you're fit you don't think people die of
[2799.72 - 2804.32] heart attacks like that I see it every
[2801.68 - 2805.68] day I see it happen all the time it's
[2804.32 - 2807.68] like wait a minute how did that
[2805.68 - 2809.00] 38-year-old guy die of a heart attack he
[2807.68 - 2811.52] was in the gym every day did you see how
[2809.00 - 2815.00] cut he was how come he's how how come
[2811.52 - 2816.64] he's dead how come he's gone I mean it's
[2815.00 - 2818.72] unbelievable
[2816.64 - 2821.00] because because you you're still putting
[2818.72 - 2823.16] in all that high fat in every single day
[2821.00 - 2824.76] which is under the Guist of high protein
[2823.16 - 2826.88] and then viruses can accumulate and then
[2824.76 - 2828.64] you can have a stroke viruses can
[2826.88 - 2830.20] accumulate because it's hiding viruses
[2828.64 - 2832.12] love to hide in the liver and hide under
[2830.20 - 2834.28] all that fat you can have a fatty liver
[2832.12 - 2836.68] but not have a scrap of fat on your skin
[2834.28 - 2838.20] on your body yet and have a fatty liver
[2836.68 - 2839.48] and not even get diagnosed by the doctor
[2838.20 - 2840.92] of having a fatty liver because they'll
[2839.48 - 2844.28] see you and be like whoo you're in good
[2840.92 - 2846.52] shape and you walk out so it getting the
[2844.28 - 2848.88] toxins out is also part of lowering the
[2846.52 - 2851.92] fats so what does that mean if you're
[2848.88 - 2853.60] doing grass-fed beef once a day I mean
[2851.92 - 2855.16] if you're doing it twice a day once a
[2853.60 - 2856.76] day if you're doing chicken at dinner
[2855.16 - 2858.20] grass-fed beef for lunch grassfed beef
[2856.76 - 2860.36] for dinner chicken for lunch get rid of
[2858.20 - 2863.16] the chicken do it once a day we do it
[2860.36 - 2864.92] once every other day get rid of eggs get
[2863.16 - 2866.52] rid of cheese milk butter I don't care
[2864.92 - 2869.24] if it's free range I don't care what it
[2866.52 - 2871.92] is get rid of eggs dairy all dairy
[2869.24 - 2873.64] products it's all high in fat all it
[2871.92 - 2875.96] does it stops you from being able to
[2873.64 - 2877.32] detox and get rid of the toxic blood it
[2875.96 - 2878.52] stops you from being able to protect
[2877.32 - 2880.16] yourself from all the different
[2878.52 - 2881.80] autoimmune diseases which aren't the
[2880.16 - 2883.40] body attacking itself but viruses
[2881.80 - 2885.00] attacking the body all the different
[2883.40 - 2887.00] autoimmune diseases that everybody's
[2885.00 - 2888.88] coming down with out there you want the
[2887.00 - 2891.20] blood less fatty so we can get the
[2888.88 - 2893.56] toxins out because everybody's blood is
[2891.20 - 2895.80] toxic I've seen people's blood so
[2893.56 - 2897.76] dehydrated and so toxic that when
[2895.80 - 2900.52] they've gone to get even blood work it's
[2897.76 - 2903.32] literally like it was it was like hard
[2900.52 - 2905.76] for them to draw blood out of them hard
[2903.32 - 2907.40] for the for the practitioners to draw
[2905.76 - 2909.00] blood out of their body and the
[2907.40 - 2910.80] practitioners didn't know why it's
[2909.00 - 2913.32] because you also get dehydrated with
[2910.80 - 2915.28] dirty blood you get chronically
[2913.32 - 2916.52] chronically dehydrated that's why I'm
[2915.28 - 2918.16] saying do the celery juice in the
[2916.52 - 2921.04] morning or cucumber juice if you really
[2918.16 - 2922.36] have to do the do the um do the lemon
[2921.04 - 2925.00] water in the morning do the heavy metal
[2922.36 - 2926.44] detox smoothie have a salad for lunch
[2925.00 - 2928.24] maybe a little bit of avocado in the
[2926.44 - 2929.64] salad how about that have tomatoes on
[2928.24 - 2932.04] there don't be afraid of tomatoes God
[2929.64 - 2933.44] for a bid they're life-saving you have
[2932.04 - 2936.20] tomatoes on there cucumbers on your
[2933.44 - 2937.96] salad lettuce is spinach okay and then
[2936.20 - 2940.04] you know and and put a little avocado on
[2937.96 - 2941.60] there if you really want you can do that
[2940.04 - 2943.08] squeeze some orange juice on there
[2941.60 - 2945.92] squeeze some oranges on there put some
[2943.08 - 2947.88] dates on there you know you can just you
[2945.92 - 2949.40] don't want your fats too high so you can
[2947.88 - 2951.12] put a little avocado in that one if you
[2949.40 - 2953.00] don't have avocado you can put some hemp
[2951.12 - 2954.36] seeds on there but you don't want it too
[2953.00 - 2956.60] high I mean that's that's if you're
[2954.36 - 2958.04] plant-based you know you're doing that
[2956.60 - 2959.60] and if you're not plant-based and you
[2958.04 - 2962.96] want to have chicken don't have you know
[2959.60 - 2964.92] 6 oz have have have 3 oz of chicken on
[2962.96 - 2967.60] your salad and don't have it again at
[2964.92 - 2970.24] night you had your chicken at night have
[2967.60 - 2972.60] some sweet potatoes at night even have a
[2970.24 - 2974.12] potato nothing wrong with a potato and
[2972.60 - 2975.68] if you're at all raw person and you're
[2974.12 - 2977.80] totally all raw do another salad with
[2975.68 - 2979.64] fruit lots of fruit do fruit for lunch
[2977.80 - 2981.72] you can do smoothies all day the point
[2979.64 - 2983.68] is there's a lot of ways of making sure
[2981.72 - 2985.40] we can lower your fats whether you're
[2983.68 - 2987.24] high protein you know animal paleo
[2985.40 - 2988.48] whatever it is or or you're in the in
[2987.24 - 2991.92] the vegan area or you're in the
[2988.48 - 2994.24] plant-based area you can you can totally
[2991.92 - 2996.08] totally lower fats bring in more fruits
[2994.24 - 2997.96] and vegetables
[2996.08 - 3000.24] and and and make a huge difference and
[2997.96 - 3002.48] impact on how toxic your blood is to
[3000.24 - 3004.24] reverse so many different conditions
[3002.48 - 3006.84] like with reenal syndrome what Happ what
[3004.24 - 3008.76] that is what rain out what that is
[3006.84 - 3010.36] that's all these poisons and toxins from
[3008.76 - 3012.08] Epstein bar virus that go to the
[3010.36 - 3013.64] extremities that's what that is with
[3012.08 - 3015.32] heavy metals with a high heavy metal
[3013.64 - 3017.24] rate so they go to the extremities
[3015.32 - 3018.80] that's toxic blood yeah we want to get
[3017.24 - 3020.16] rid of the viral debris and all that but
[3018.80 - 3021.44] you have to at least start cleaning up
[3020.16 - 3022.76] your blood and start getting yourself
[3021.44 - 3025.16] better and start rebuilding and
[3022.76 - 3027.40] cleansing your liver and the whole bit
[3025.16 - 3030.32] so is everybody's blood toxic out there
[3027.40 - 3031.68] 100% yes it is different levels
