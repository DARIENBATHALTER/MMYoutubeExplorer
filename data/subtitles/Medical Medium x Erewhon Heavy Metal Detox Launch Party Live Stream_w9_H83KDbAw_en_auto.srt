00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,760
powerful as it is so I just I love that

569
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:13,160
story as a reminder that you know

570
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,839
sometimes you get a know in life but you

571
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,880
know rejection whatever you want to call

572
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:19,590
it is God's redirection and protection

573
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,200
so what a

574
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,800
[Music]

575
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,359
gift um and that brings me I I kind of

576
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,160
just wanted to review speaking of Kelly

577
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:30,640
Turner she did if you don't if you're

578
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,559
not familiar she was um the researcher

579
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,880
who wrote the book radical remission and

580
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,520
she was

581
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,800
so blown away by the possibility of

582
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,520
spontaneous healing and she was not she

583
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,680
was wondering why nobody was

584
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,160
studying how those people healed they

585
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,400
were kind of just dismissed in medicine

586
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,440
as as anomalies and she's like but

587
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,240
there's there's so many of them she kept

588
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,800
thousands and thousands so she studied

589
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:59,680
she made it her research project project

590
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,640
and she studied like 1500 people that

591
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,520
healed from cancers they were told they

592
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,800
were not able to heal from so these were

593
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,680
Radical

594
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:13,200
remissions and she discovered that they

595
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,880
did they all did 10 things consistently

596
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,359
to heal that helped them heal and so she

597
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,880
shared those things as the back when I

598
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:22,079
made heal was only nine but then she

599
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,800
added movement because they all did some

600
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,960
sort of movement or exercise so it's now

601
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
10 things and I want to just read them

602
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,319
to you to remind you because I don't

603
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,760
think that this just applies to cancer I

604
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,880
think it applies to all chronic illness

605
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:41,680
in mystery illness um and the

606
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:44,760
fascinating thing is out of those 10

607
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,680
only three of them are physical so 30%

608
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,559
is and the rest are mental emotional and

609
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,000
spiritual and so let me read them

610
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,720
because don't want to forget all right

611
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,240
so the first one is radically changing

612
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,640
your diet

613
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,520
which obviously the medical medium

614
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,280
information is going to help you do

615
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,680
thank god um thank you Spirit of

616
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,160
compassion and the second one is using

617
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,280
herbs and supplements the third is

618
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:17,200
movement exercise and just moving your

619
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,359
body so those are the three physical and

620
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,240
then it goes on to taking control of

621
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:26,079
your health we've got to take our power

622
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,400
back when it comes to Healing um the

623
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,520
fourth one

624
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,559
is following your intuition which I'm

625
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,559
going to talk a little bit more

626
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:40,760
about um then releasing suppressed

627
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:43,680
emotions increasing positive

628
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,799
emotions embracing social support we've

629
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,839
got an amazing Community around

630
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:52,000
us it's it's proven to help when you

631
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:55,640
join cancer I think cancer survivors

632
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,480
that joined um support groups are like

633
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:02,559
50% more likely to heal so Community is

634
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:05,280
is massive um deepening your spiritual

635
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,319
connection and having strong reasons for

636
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,799
living so those are the essentials that

637
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,720
people that spontaneously healed or

638
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,200
healed when they were told they couldn't

639
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,119
all did I think those are important but

640
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,040
I wanted to talk a little bit about

641
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,799
intuition because you know so many

642
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,440
people back when I met Anthony he was

643
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:26,960
still reading for

644
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:31,799
people and you know I I seek out

645
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,520
intuitives I seek out healers and you

646
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:35,319
want that validation you want that

647
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,480
support you want that feedback from

648
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:41,599
people that have exceptional gifts but I

649
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,440
think the time has come now to really

650
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,079
hone your own instrument because our

651
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,440
bodies are so brilliantly designed we're

652
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,760
tuning Forks to the Divine we're all

653
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,160
little fractals of the Divine and

654
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,640
healing you know the root word for heal

655
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,920
is actually wholeness

656
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,599
and you know we are whole spiritually we

657
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,960
are whole and perfect Divine beings and

658
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,359
we come into this Human Experience and

659
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:12,599
there's some distortions that come

660
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:15,480
through um and so healing is is is

661
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:18,760
remembering your Divinity

662
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,079
and I feel like now in is a time in the

663
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,240
world where we're inundated with so much

664
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,040
information obviously there's a

665
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,040
frequency change frequency is rising

666
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,839
there's a lot of pressure on the planet

667
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,960
and it's pressure to release our own

668
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:37,559
gifts

669
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,599
and so I know yeah so what I'm trying to

670
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:43,559
say is that our bodies are brilliantly

671
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,319
designed to be our biggest Aly in this

672
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,799
you know we're Spiritual Beings in this

673
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:50,559
human body and we all have even though

674
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:53,280
Anthony has a spectacular amazing gift

675
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,160
that is helping Millions access the

676
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,640
healing

677
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:01,079
within we all have our intuition is the

678
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,319
strongest Truth for ourselves so now is

679
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,160
the time to hone that instrument and

680
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:06,839
it's okay to get feedback from other

681
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,680
people to

682
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:12,119
strengthen that um confidence in your

683
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,480
own

684
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:19,880
wisdom but with like the rise of AI and

685
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:23,200
this artificial intelligence that is

686
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,559
amazing in so many ways it becomes scary

687
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,119
when we lose our discernment of what is

688
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:32,079
reality and what's true truth and so now

689
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:34,000
is the time to hone our own gifts and

690
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,520
tune in to our own intuition because

691
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,680
that is what's going to guide you on

692
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,760
your journey and to your truth and and

693
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,680
our bodies are designed to give you that

694
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,799
feedback but we need to cleanse our

695
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,599
instrument in order to um hear those

696
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:55,400
messages clearly and so that's why we

697
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,200
have to do the heavy metal detox and

698
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,599
release depressed emot

699
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:03,280
and do all these healing things and I

700
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:06,319
think um I just want to remind people of

701
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,319
their own gifts and to access them we

702
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:11,880
have to keep our instrument as clean and

703
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,640
pure as possible so that we can receive

704
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,319
those

705
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,440
messages to guide us on our way um and

706
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,319
you all have that ability in you that's

707
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,319
how brilliantly and beautifully we're

708
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,319
designed

709
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,280
[Applause]

710
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,079
[Music]

711
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,720
so um

712
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:36,559
yeah and let's see I think we're GNA

713
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:38,440

breathing and moving our bodies which is

716
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:47,720
another way to get that instrument clear

717
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,359
and high vibration change the frequency

00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,680

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,160
want you to say to heal

754
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,240
cleanse louder

755
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,280
cleanse all right all right we'll awake

756
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:41,520
hey so it's just such an honor to be

757
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,880
here to connect with you in community

758
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,559
we've all been through this journey

759
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,039
right of understanding who we truly are

760
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,119
and our personal power so I'm going to

761
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:55,079
go through a couple of exercises that

762
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:58,079
have helped me when I felt down when I

763
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,079
felt

764
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,319
oh yeah she lives a healthy life and

765
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,039
she's traveling the world with her

766
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,079
fiance and she doesn't have a care in

767
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,920
the

768
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:15,359
world but what they don't know is that I

769
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,559
experience High functional

770
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,599
depression what they don't know and this

771
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:23,079
is my first time sharing publicly was

772
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,880
years ago when I got my blood work done

773
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:28,319
I found out I was I had Lyme disease and

774
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:31,119
I was fine I look just like I look today

775
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:35,079
I had no symptoms but it came up in my

776
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:38,599
blood work we are all in a very toxic

777
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:41,240
World we're breathing in that every day

778
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:43,559
so it's important while a lot of us see

779
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,440
the symptoms some of us are experiencing

780
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:50,520
things we have no idea about until it

781
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,680
hits us like a ton of bricks so I stand

782
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,839
with you not above or below but with and

783
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:00,240
I truly think in community

784
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,599
is the way we heal the best and so this

785
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,520
practice I'm going to do with you is

786
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,480
something that I do before every single

787
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,359
meeting and it start with the breath

788
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,160
because breath is spirit and it's our

789
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,960
free tool that we have to regulate our

790
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,640
system and even if you're on your

791
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,359
hospital bed you can breathe to connect

792
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,440
and to start the healing process are

793
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:21,359
y'all down to that with

794
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:24,160
me all right so everyone who can I

795
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,240
invite you to stand to your

796
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,599

our energy we're going to inhale through

800
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,720
the nose and we're going to let an

801
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,640
audible sigh out of the mouth just a

802
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,000
little bit of breathing just breathing

803
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,079

peace exhale

809
00:57:54,839 --> 00:58:00,400
chaos in

810
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,280
inhale and exhale you might start

811
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,000
feeling energy moving move your body a

812
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,000
little bit you're like yeah that feels

813
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,680
good yeah we are alive we are living

814
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,640
beings we're meant to move and smile and

815
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,319
laugh even though we go through those

816
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,200
moments when we can't get off the couch

817
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:17,440
and can't be happy so if you want to

818
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,920
laugh you want to yell at any time I

819
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:27,200
invite you yes yes yes fully expressed

820
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:29,079
fully expressed fully expressed

821
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,319
absolutely because that's the way we

822
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:33,559
release fear that's the way we release

823
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:36,200
trauma that's the way we release lower

824
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:37,680
vibrations that don't serve us right all

825
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,440
right so the next thing we're going to

826
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,400
do is like an energy release it's a

827
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,000
somatic practice we're going to inhale

828
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,480
bring the arms up if you can and exhale

829
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,119
bring them back behind you

830
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:55,599
inhale exhale inhale love exhale fear

831
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:57,559
inhale exhale any negative energy you

832
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,880
experience on the way here at the

833
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:01,839
grocery store maybe on the drive we're

834
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,880
going to release that right now because

835
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,119
when you release low vibrations what do

836
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,319
you do you align yourself with the

837
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,039
highest and most powerful version of

838
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,559
yourself from that place you can heal

839
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,480
she's doing it with the dog that's what

840
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,960
I'm talking about one more time inhale

841
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,680
and exhale Let It Go all right now move

842
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,520
around dance around dance around dance

843
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,559
around all right now we can relax a

844
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,480
little bit right did that feel

845
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:30,559
good all right awesome so what I love to

846
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,359
do is really start with these six areas

847
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,359
of well-being the first area is

848
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:38,119
spiritual well-being right and for

849
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:41,200
Spiritual well-being that's how we

850
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:43,480
connect as Kelly said to our divine self

851
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,160
when we are well and we are connected in

852
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:49,160
Divine Alignment with our source we get

853
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,520
the Divine downloads to heal and all of

854
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,319
us are unique some of us more powerful

855
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,240
than others because we've tapped in a

856
00:59:53,319 --> 01:00:00,039
lot like Anthony I mean give a run of a

857
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:03,160
for Anthony y'all he does a lot of

858
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:04,640
incredible work despite being ridiculed

859
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,680
despite being touch I'm going to need

860
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,280
you to be a little bit louder because

861
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:13,359
it's not easy it's not easy to lead this

862
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,559
charge it's not easy to do this work and

863
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,640
it's not easy to keep going when

864
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,880
everywhere around you no matter how much

865
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,880
good work you do you're being turned

866
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,160
down so I just need to give him his

867
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,359
flowers while he's here and rushing out

868
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,559
and now I want to give you your flowers

869
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:31,000
give yourself a round of applause for

870
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,119
showing up for standing in line to

871
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,760
buying those smoothies to doing

872
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,319
everything you needed to do to get here

873
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:42,000
this is called celebration there's a lot

874
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:44,160
of crazy things going on in the world

875
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,680
but one thing to spiritually align is

876
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,880
gratitude gratitude for your life

877
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,839
gratitude for your family gratitude for

878
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,839
your community and gratitude for our

879
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:54,559
leaders so give yourself another round

880
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:57,839
of applause because you've been through

881
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:01,920
a lot to get here you're here

882
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:04,880
shining when you are well the world is a

883
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,839
better place to be when you are well

884
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,079
your family is well and so long we're

885
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:13,920
like oh put yourself last when did we

886
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:15,960
start that why did we start that because

887
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,440
we all know when you are well everyone

888
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,319
around you is well so raise your hand if

889
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,839
you're going to commit to prioritizing

890
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,200
your

891
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:26,559
well-being I don't have everybody yet

892
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:29,160
raise your hand if you want to commit to

893
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,440
prioritizing loving on yourself first

894
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,480
and most because you know when you love

895
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,680
on yourself everybody else benefits all

896
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,520
right put your hand down all right so

897
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,839
that's spiritual well-being just really

898
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,640
activating through the breath through

899
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:44,079
movement so you can Divine a line

900
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:45,640
despite what happens to you so whenever

901
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,119
you're frustrated on this journey on

902
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,760
your journey home remember your tools of

903
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:52,880
breath to regulate your nervous system

904
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,920
bring you back into that parasympathetic

905
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:59,000
alignment so you can rest digest and

906
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,200
come back to love every single time I

907
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,279
was on Kelly's podcast yesterday and we

908
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,640
were talking about heated stuff and we

909
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:05,839
were both energetically charged and

910
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,240
she's like oh I didn't want to end the

911
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,920
podcast this way I was like cool we'll

912
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,680
change it right now and we went into

913
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,359
breath and we left on a very high note

914
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,240
so you can do it just like that right

915
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:17,839
but sometimes it's not easy sometimes

916
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,720
you need to move sometimes you need to

917
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:22,119
shake sometimes you need to take herbs

918
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:24,599
and supplements that help you come down

919
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:27,079
and come back to your truth but remember

920
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,960
your tools every single time cuz no

921
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:31,559
matter how far you get in your healing

922
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,480
Journey because we live in a toxic world

923
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:37,079
you need your tools to stay healthy all

924
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,240
right the second is emotional regulation

925
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,559
and emotional well-being how many people

926
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,720
know how to regulate your

927
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:46,200
emotions okay that's less than 1% all

928
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,279
right so we're going to work on that so

929
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,920
the first thing I want you to do is

930
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:51,279
think about how you feel place your

931
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,599
right hand on your

932
01:02:51,279 --> 01:02:55,839
heart and I invite you to close your

933
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,920
eyes or gaze down at the ground if you

934
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,880
you feel safe if not do whatever feels

about the last week if you felt anything

952
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,760
outside of love let's be honest about

953
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:54,119
that emotion too I'll start

954
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,279
frustration I got another one

955
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,520
overwhelmed what about you

956
01:03:56,279 --> 01:04:03,880
fear

957
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:07,359
uhhuh anybody else anger

958
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:12,039
yeah anxiety

959
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:14,039
yeah depression yeah it's okay to

960
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:16,599
acknowledge when you're not feeling your

961
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:19,400
best it's okay to acknowledge when

962
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:22,359
you're not well because it's in that

963
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,880
acknowledgement that the healing starts

964
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:27,359
right if I never knew and never was just

965
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,039
doing this random activation with a

966
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:32,240
company I would have never known that I

967
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:33,960
needed to do some more things in my life

968
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,720
to improve my well-being even though I

969
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,680
felt good and then I just started my

970
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,880
fertility journey I found out oh you're

971
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,680
still low in DHEA you're still I'm like

972
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,119
what I feel great but the numbers are

973
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,160
telling me the truth right so I took

974
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:52,400
that frustration and took control of my

975
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,079
life and said all right I'll add some

976
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,640
more herbs and supplements because I

977
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,279
know how what that does for my

978
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,359
so remember don't feel alone if you feel

979
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:03,119

takes to be well right and I can say

984
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,240

physically physical well-being is also

1059
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,120
important where to be walking or dancing

1060
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,920

dancing yes dancing is one of the best

1066
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:45,759
ways to move your body get that movement

1067
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,640
in your joints and ligaments and also it

1068
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,199
releases endorsement so you feel better

1069
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,080
and you release the dopamine and you

1070
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:55,199
feel good in your body so moving every

1071
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,640
day even if you can't go to the gym even

1072
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,679
if you can't leave lift heavy weights

1073
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,199
just dancing around moving your body or

1074
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,799
just shaking it's so good or if you're

1075
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:07,319
just in your bed just you know moving

1076
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:08,600
around a little bit is waking you up to

1077
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,960
your true

1078
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,440
self and then the next area of

1079
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,159
well-being that I

1080
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:17,359

I'm

1099
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,320
42 and there was a time in my life where

1100
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,159
I gave up on love I felt like you know

1101
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:10,280
what I've been dating the most toxic

1102
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,760
humans and some of you might be able to

1103
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,199
relate and I'm like you know what maybe

1104
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,400
it's just not for me in this

1105
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:18,520
lifetime but I had some healing to do

1106
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,840
she's like don't put me out sis but it's

1107
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,000
okay I feel you I'm with you

1108
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,640
right but then I did some deeper healing

1109
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,040
work

1110
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,040
and I reached out to my mentors and my

1111
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:35,040
leaders and I felt like I had a I had

1112
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:37,679
some fatherhood trauma that I needed to

1113
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,760
heal I had some experiences that

1114
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,600
happened to me including assault that I

1115
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:46,040

1124
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,480

know what I'm not doing okay right now

1137
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,080
I'm someone that came from humble

1138
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,480
beginnings I was raised in a trailer it

1139
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:39,400
was six of us we drank powdered milk we

1140
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,920
didn't have much I never thought I would

1141
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,800
be living the life that I'm living now

1142
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,560

1144
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,480
world I never thought that would be my

1145
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,679
reality I feel like that's something a

1146
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,880
life for someone else but I had this

1147
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:56,600
desire in my heart and in my dreams I

1148
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,440
saw myself speaking to crowds like this

1149
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,120

[Applause]

1223
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,719
okay all right I don't know if many of

1224
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:14,480
you have actually experienced it the

1225
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:17,120
last one I did publicly or live in in a

1226
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:20,159
physical form was probably nine years

1227
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:23,040
ago okay we've done them virtually many

1228
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:25,120
of you might have experienced it right

1229
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,800
have you

1230
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,560
yep it's pretty intense but it's going

1231
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,800
to be great it's going to be great okay

1232
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:36,800
so since I was 4 years old Spirit of

1233
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:41,320
compassion taught me about this light

1234
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,560
that can come down if spirit and I are

1235
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:47,000
communicating and this light can come

1236
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,120
down so when I was a child I used the

1237
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,239
light to heal

1238
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:54,560
animals so if there was a baby bird with

1239
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:56,080
a broken wing I would ask Spirit send

1240
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,159
down the

1241
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,400
light if there was an injured dog or an

1242
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:04,320
injured

1243
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,719
cat or an injured animal or a turtle I

1244
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,960
would ask Spirit of compassion to send

1245
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:09,880
down the light and then if I was driving

1246
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,760
in the car with my family and I was in

1247
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,360
the back

1248
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:18,280
seat and driving by people and then

1249
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,600
getting readings that people needed help

1250
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:23,280
or their health was was in some kind of

1251
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,239
condition where they were struggling I

1252
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,600
would be in the backseat of the car 8

1253
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:29,800
years old 7 years old and I would say

1254
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,239
send the light down that's what I would

1255
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,400
do and the spirit of compassion taught

1256
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:37,480
me how to use this light and I've

1257
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:40,360
learned how to work with spirit with

1258
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,800
this and so what's going to happen here

1259
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,480
is the light's going to come down and

1260
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,719
it's going to hit the top of everybody's

1261
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:49,400
head that's where it's going to

1262
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,719
hit it's not going to hit their shoulder

1263
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:54,080
or their arm or their hand but it's it's

1264
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:55,920
going to hit the crown of everybody's

1265
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,120
head here

1266
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,760
and even going as far back from what

1267
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,679
spirit's telling me even far back there

1268
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,920
all the way there and in the line over

1269
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:07,679
there

1270
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:10,520
too okay think about what you want

1271
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:13,800
better in your life think about what you

1272
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,800
want healed in your life think about

1273
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,840
where you want the light

1274
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:22,880
directed where is it that you want it

1275
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:25,600
directed is it your heart is it your

1276
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,719
kidney right is it your

1277
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,320
back is it a loved one too that's

1278
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,400
somewhere else and maybe try to direct

1279
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,760
it to

1280
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,199
them but either way it's coming down and

1281
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,800
it's going to hit the top of our heads

1282
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:41,440
okay so what's going to happen is I'm

1283
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,840
going to ask you to take a quick breath

1284
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,080
you're going to hold it and then I'm

1285
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,719
going to tell you to release and right

1286
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,120
when we take that breath and hold it for

1287
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:52,600
that second the light's going to come

1288
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:55,239
down right on top of everybody's head

1289
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,560
okay now this light

1290
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:59,679
some may see it some may not a lot of

1291
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,639
people do they close their eyes and they

1292
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:05,280
see it a lot of people feel it

1293
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:07,960
immediately you might feel tingles you

1294
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:11,679

1297
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,600
going to

1298
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,960
happen now this light's going to stay in

1299
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,920

1300
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,719
effects of it can even go as long as

1301
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,080
weeks after after this and a lot of

1302
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,840
people things change for them they their

1303
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,120
their healing is

1304
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,400
ignited because that's what it has done

1305
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,840
for so

1306
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,440
many there the reason why I don't do a

1307
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:42,120
lot of them it's pretty intense takes a

1308
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,239
lot out of me but that's okay because

1309
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:49,880
this is the time to do it if there's any

1310
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:49,880
time to ever do it it's now it's now

1311
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,400
we're going to do it a couple of times

1312
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:03,560
now A lot of people have blockages in

1313
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,639
them they have emotional

1314
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:07,320
blocks maybe they picked up some

1315
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:09,960
negative energy not because they're a

1316
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,920
bad person because they happen to be

1317
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,880
around negative energy somewhere right A

1318
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,960
lot of people have been misunderstood

1319
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,679
you guys have been judged along the way

1320
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,600
the medical medium crowd is the toughest

1321
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:25,440
crowd though the toughest crowd there

1322
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,920
is and it's the only heal Community

1323
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,880
where people have come back from

1324
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,760
wheelchairs they've come back from the

1325
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,520
worst conditions they've risen out of

1326
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,560
the ashes okay so I know you guys are

1327
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,560
tough you guys are

1328
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:41,800
strong think about where you want that

1329
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,040
light directed inside your body and even

1330
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,040
if for some reason you have it directed

1331
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:52,239
to some place in your body like your

1332
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:55,320
brain or your heart or your soul or your

1333
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:57,840
soul anything can happen

1334
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:01,159
when that light goes into us anything

1335
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:04,120
can happen anything even if you say I

1336
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:05,440
wanted to make my heart better that

1337
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,719
light's going to run through all of us

1338
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,920
now many of us have blockages like I was

1339
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:12,639
saying before and it may take a little

1340
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,080
bit of time to get the light all the way

1341
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,360
through to everybody but there's a lot

1342
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,880
of people here it's going to go right

1343
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:19,400
through them right from the top of their

1344
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,280
head down to the ground but a lot of

1345
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,960
people it's going to get stuck somewhere

1346
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,360
some people it's going to get stuck here

1347
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,920
some people it's going to stop here so

1348
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,199
we're going to do it until Spirit of

1349
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,199
compassion says enough people it went

1350
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:31,760
through and down to the

1351
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:34,520
ground

1352
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,199

1353
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,159

1357
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,719
this event and I wanted that to happen

1358
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,920
direct the light to somebody else okay

1359
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,639
if you have to you'll still get it but

1360
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,400
it's also going to go to somebody else a

1361
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:59,320

1362
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:01,000

02:07:02,679 --> 02:07:07,159
light and I had been studying with other

1847
02:07:04,559 --> 02:07:08,960
teachers at that time and other uh

1848
02:07:07,159 --> 02:07:12,440
experiences of energy and it was just

1849
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:15,559
something so different and so incredible

1850
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:20,960
um but um I just wanted to give a little

1851
02:07:15,559 --> 02:07:23,760
story about when I um when I came to uh

1852
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,599
the airport to come here today uh I ran

1853
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,280
into a family who actually called out my

1854
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:29,559
name and said hey Dr shery Green and I

1855
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,520
turned around and it's the Rini family

1856
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:35,199
who I didn't know in person I only knew

1857
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:38,320
them by uh Instagram name and they were

1858
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:40,920
just it was so nice to when you feel

1859
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:43,520
like you're in the middle of you're not

1860
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:46,119
seen or you're not heard or or you're

1861
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,800
isolated all of those feelings that you

1862
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:49,559
know when you're doing something so

1863
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,719
different than the rest of the world and

1864
02:07:49,559 --> 02:07:53,480
how important it is to meet the these

1865
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:56,480
kindred spirits that show up on your

1866
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:57,960
path and we compared food bags and like

1867
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:00,480
how much food we were pcking on the

1868
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:02,599
plane and to get here so that was really

1869
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:07,040
fun and when I got here today and just

1870
02:08:02,599 --> 02:08:11,159
circled Awan and saw these smiling faces

1871
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:13,040
and just this event today is just so

1872
02:08:11,159 --> 02:08:15,679
magical and I feel like I've definitely

1873
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:19,760
waited a lifetime to be right here in

1874
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:21,960
this position right now so

1875
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,040
anyway um I do

1876
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:25,679
I did write a speech out because I

1877
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:28,960
really don't want to forget some

1878
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:33,239

today in this Sacred Space at this

1904
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:41,719

coincidences for me being here

1906
02:09:41,719 --> 02:09:46,559
represents the Fulfillment of a long

1907
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:48,360
cherished dream to transform our broken

1908
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:52,040
medical system and reimagine the

1909
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:52,040
landscape of healing

1910
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:58,040
yeah absolutely no longer would those

suffering from chronic illness feel lost

1912
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:03,199
their conditions unresolved and labeled

1913
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:06,159
with no real answers in sight we have

1914
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:09,679
real answers now the Pearls of Wisdom in

1915
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:13,920
these books podcast lives and emails are

1916
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:13,920
Priceless and not to be taken for

1917
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,239
granted my life was forever changed when

1918
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:20,800
I discovered medical medium information

1919
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:23,119
in 2015 through a dear friend of mine

1920
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:25,719
who was also also suffering during my

1921
02:10:23,119 --> 02:10:28,440
own healing journey to L to a heal a

1922
02:10:25,719 --> 02:10:29,960
list of disabling chronic symptoms I

1923
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:32,040
just knew that this was something

1924
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:34,599
extraordinarily special and different

1925
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:37,880
from anything I had ever researched or

1926
02:10:34,599 --> 02:10:41,000
studied before and I had studied a

1927
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:43,800
lot my first call with Anthony in 20 the

1928
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,679
November of 2015 turned my world and

1929
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:48,119
practice upside down in the most

1930
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:50,880
beautiful and enlightening way with the

1931
02:10:48,119 --> 02:10:53,280
invaluable knowledge he has gifted us we

1932
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:55,960
can now now perceive root causes like

1933
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:58,960
never before I've witnessed incredible

1934
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:01,199
healings unfolding before my eyes I

1935
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,320
understand the profound workings of the

1936
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:06,159
human body and spirit in ways I could

1937
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:08,280
have only dreamed this is true deep

1938
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:09,520
multi-dimensional healing of the Mind

1939
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:12,239
Body and

1940
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:15,360
Soul I personally have needed to stand

1941
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:17,360
strong amongst the doubters naysayers

1942
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:20,159
professional colleagues and bullies in

1943
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:22,960
my own field as I know you all have

1944
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:25,440
faced as well

1945
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:27,880
the commonality for us is when the truth

1946
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:31,280
is felt within we don't just back down

1947
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:33,880
or walk away we can't it's an unspoken

1948
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:36,079
drive from the heart spirit and soul we

1949
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:38,800
need this Divine guidance to navate

1950
02:11:36,079 --> 02:11:41,440
navigate the incredibly complex chronic

1951
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:44,159
illnesses we are facing today afflicting

1952
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:45,000
our patients our families our friends

1953
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:47,520
and

1954
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,360
neighbors I pray more people open their

1955
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:51,520
hearts and Minds to embrace this

1956
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:54,119
information no matter how difficult the

1957
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:56,079
lifestyle changes may seem and I pray

1958
02:11:54,119 --> 02:11:58,760
that practitioners across all Medical

1959
02:11:56,079 --> 02:12:01,480
Specialties find the courage to come out

1960
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:04,440
of the closet and share these teachings

1961
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:07,320
far and wide I pray the rest of these

1962
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:10,199
sacred teachings to be to continue to be

1963
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:12,199
revealed unobstructed we all deserve

1964
02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:15,000
true healing it is our

1965
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:18,239
Birthright I pray this information stays

1966
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,239
sacred and

1967
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:25,679
safe and then passed on and on through

1968
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:27,400
the generations to come that will need

1969
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,239

1970
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:33,040

you well I am deeply honored I never

imagined that I would be up here

2060
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:55,000
speaking

2061
02:20:52,240 --> 02:21:00,280
and I just want to say a few things but

2062
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:03,920
first I want to begin with my heart is

2063
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:05,040
truly with everyone that wasn't able to

2064
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:07,479
come

2065
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:09,560
here for whatever

2066
02:21:07,479 --> 02:21:14,280
reason

2067
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:17,680
and I just know that we all love and

2068
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:20,160
care about you and know that you are in

2069
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:21,479
our thoughts so that's what I want to

2070
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:27,359
start off

2071
02:21:21,479 --> 02:21:31,560
with um thank you so Underdog Warriors

2072
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:35,120
is a 501c3 not for-profit

2073
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:36,640
Corporation and I am one of the

2074
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:39,120
co-founders

2075
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:40,760
so this

2076
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:44,600
organization

2077
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:46,600
began due to my own

2078
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:51,800
experience

2079
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:55,359
and I remember being in

2080
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:58,680
and then in this small office and just

2081
02:21:55,359 --> 02:22:01,960
kind of walking back and forth and then

2082
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:05,240
this idea came to me and it was one of

2083
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:09,560
those things that felt like an Angelic

2084
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:11,560
moment and that was it I felt that an

2085
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:14,280
organization needed to be started to

2086
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:20,280
help support people that didn't have the

2087
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:20,280
financial means to support their healing

2088
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:28,760
that was me for a very very long

2089
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:33,960
time I didn't have the support I

2090
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:36,520
needed I would watch people online make

2091
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:38,439
their micro shock

2092
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:41,720
therapies

2093
02:22:38,439 --> 02:22:45,680
and I didn't have the means to purchase

2094
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:48,640
the micro to make my micro shock therapy

2095
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:51,000
so I would watch people online and I

2096
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:54,439
just knew that there would be a time

2097
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:57,280
where I would have the opportunities

2098
02:22:54,439 --> 02:22:59,840
that I needed come my way and and to

2099
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:03,200
feel better whether it was

2100
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:05,960
physically emotionally spiritually just

2101
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:07,000
to feel better in all in every sense of

2102
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:10,640
the

2103
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:14,240
way and so that's really how it came

2104
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:15,120
about and Underdog Warriors was formed

2105
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:19,680
the

2106
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:24,080
name I'm not quite sure how I coined it

2107
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:26,600
together but I just knew that we are The

2108
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:30,399
Underdogs we are the people that aren't

2109
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:32,399
seen out there that are held back that

2110
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:34,920
our voice isn't

2111
02:23:32,399 --> 02:23:37,600
heard and that really doesn't come until

2112
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:41,279
we come out of it but I've also learned

2113
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:44,439
that during the process you do find your

2114
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:46,439
voice and and that's what makes us The

2115
02:23:44,439 --> 02:23:49,720
Underdogs and we all know that the

2116
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:52,560
chronically sick are always held back

2117
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:56,640
and as a always puts it we're always

2118
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:56,640
swept under the rug isn't that

2119
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:07,120
true so many people go through this life

2120
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:08,720
suffering not just

2121
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:10,680
physically

2122
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:13,120
emotionally

2123
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:16,040
spiritually and Underdog Warriors is

2124
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:20,040
there to help support those

2125
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:20,040
people now

2126
02:24:21,399 --> 02:24:26,760
throughout the

2127
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:31,160
years and especially this

2128
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:34,359
year I have come through some big trials

2129
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:38,120
and a lot of that is is shaping what

2130
02:24:34,359 --> 02:24:40,080
Underdog Warriors is and what it is now

2131
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:43,840
and I wish I could say more about it

2132
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:47,279
it's just it's a lot just know

2133
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:49,080
that that my heart is there and I want

2134
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:51,760
people to just feel

2135
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:54,680
supported I

2136
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:57,399
myself I stopped counting I made a list

2137
02:24:54,680 --> 02:25:00,000
I had over a 100 symptoms I still have

2138
02:24:57,399 --> 02:25:03,439
some symptoms but that's okay I'm in a

2139
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,600
much much better place now and all those

2140
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:08,439
years of suffering all those years of

2141
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:09,960
being alone all of those years without

2142
02:25:08,439 --> 02:25:14,880
being

2143
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:18,439
support in the end it all just makes us

2144
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:21,160
who we do become and who we are and how

2145
02:25:18,439 --> 02:25:23,600
our voice develops

2146
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:27,279
and so what I want to say

2147
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:27,279
is and just to

2148
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:33,520
emphasize Underdog Warriors is going to

2149
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,560
be that

2150
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:37,359
organization that helps support the

2151
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:40,560
whole Community whether it helps to

2152
02:25:37,359 --> 02:25:43,640
support other organizations within the

2153
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:46,160
community and the individuals so far

2154
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:48,399
what we have done is we've

2155
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:50,800
supported uh so we go through an

2156
02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:52,720
application process

2157
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:56,520
and we have we announc that through

2158
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:58,880
social media through email uh and VI and

2159
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:00,760
our website and so what we do is we go

2160
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:02,680
through this application process we

2161
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:05,520
choose the

2162
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:07,720
individuals uh that need that that may

2163
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:10,760
need supplements and quite

2164
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:12,520
honestly I would say that every single

2165
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:14,880
individual that

2166
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:18,000
applies needs

2167
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:21,160
support up until now though we have not

2168
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:24,240
been able to provide the

2169
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:25,920
supplements vimergy supplements Wyman's

2170
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:29,560
wild blueberry

2171
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:34,560
juice uh other healing tools such as

2172
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:37,479
medical medium a recommended uh what any

2173
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:40,040
other supplement or even juicers Omega

2174
02:26:37,479 --> 02:26:44,319
juicers to people so we have bought all

2175
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:47,399
of these items for people

2176
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:49,720
and and here's the best part about it

2177
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:50,800
there's so much admin work we have to do

2178
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:53,200
and

2179
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:56,000
behind the scenes so many things that

2180
02:26:53,200 --> 02:27:00,800
need to be done but the best part about

2181
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:04,160
it is when our recipients get those

2182
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:06,760
gifts and because they know the value of

2183
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:09,439
them and they know how much how much

2184
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:11,560
it's there to support them and their

2185
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:15,080
healing

2186
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:17,600
and and we for the most part people have

2187
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:22,160
told us that they don't

2188
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:22,160
feel that they are worthy

2189
02:27:22,399 --> 02:27:28,080
of receiving what I perceive to be just

2190
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:31,399
a small

2191
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:34,120
act and and that's the whole touching

2192
02:27:31,399 --> 02:27:36,359
part about it because there's a lot that

2193
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:41,359
needs to be done behind the

2194
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:44,160
scenes but I'm most grateful for those

2195
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:47,479
moments and I wanted to share that with

2196
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:51,840
you because that's what your donations

2197
02:27:47,479 --> 02:27:53,880
do we promise from our Inception that

2198
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:56,680
every single dollar that would be

2199
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:59,760
donated would go right back to the

2200
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:02,920
community none of the directors up until

2201
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,240
this point or anyone else have received

2202
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:09,400
any

2203
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:15,120
compensation and I'm very very proud of

2204
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:18,279
[Applause]

2205
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:21,960
that it's how it was meant to be and

2206
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:24,640
it's how it will always be meant to be

2207
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:26,960
and and that's one of that that's one of

2208
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:29,960
the things that I just find the most the

2209
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:32,960
most joy in I I don't care

2210
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:35,120
about being compensated or anything like

2211
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:39,760
that I just want this organization to

2212
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:39,760
thrive and for some

2213
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:45,240
reason well it hasn't come so easily

2214
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,040
that's what I was just about to say

2215
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:50,560
there's a lot of hard work go going

2216
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:54,640
behind it it's for some reason reason

2217
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:58,399
God has just supported us and and the

2218
02:28:54,640 --> 02:29:00,760
means have just have just come and

2219
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:02,479
everyone has reached out as I mentioned

2220
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:04,479
before we provide our recipients with

2221
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:07,920
vimergy supplements Wyman's wild

2222
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:10,000
blueberry juice we're working towards uh

2223
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:13,160
providing our recipients with the proper

2224
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,200
medical care that they may also need and

2225
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:17,800
we're just expanding and trying to help

2226
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:21,800
people and however we

2227
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:24,680
can and and with that we've just found

2228
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:28,200
so much support something that I never

2229
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:31,880
had before or or even felt

2230
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:34,200
supported uh my parents are here with me

2231
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:36,840
I can't say that I've

2232
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:40,160
always had the support that I've needed

2233
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:44,720
from them I know they love me but

2234
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:44,720
they've never understood what I've gone

2235
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:51,000
through and that's why I want Underdog

2236
02:29:49,319 --> 02:29:55,880
Wars

2237
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,880
to help be a bit of that support for

2238
02:29:56,830 --> 02:30:09,399
[Applause]

2239
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:12,680
others so again it's just deeply it's a

2240
02:30:09,399 --> 02:30:18,200
deep deep honor to even just be standing

2241
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:18,200
here because again it wasn't something I

2242
02:30:18,359 --> 02:30:22,479
expected it's just something that's

2243
02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:24,200
happened just like everything else that

2244
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:28,120
has happened within the

2245
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:31,560
organization and I of course am just

2246
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:33,200
representing everyone behind it everyone

2247
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:35,399
there have been so many people that have

2248
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:36,640
just supported us to get us where we're

2249
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:39,439

2274
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:53,279
things I never imagined that I would

2275
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:57,560
speak about this up here on a stage we

2276
02:31:53,279 --> 02:32:01,200
ran a fundraiser at the end of the year

2277
02:31:57,560 --> 02:32:02,600
so back in December and that fundraiser

2278
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:05,560
went

2279
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:09,240
beyond expected it

2280
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:11,520
was it was so incredible we had one

2281
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:15,080
donor come to us for a

2282
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:18,080
$115,000 matching donation well what

2283
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:18,080
happened

2284
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:27,080
what ended up happening was we exceeded

2285
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:30,200
our goal we had another donor that

2286
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:34,760
approached us with to to be able to

2287
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:36,800
match the 15K so he also put up some

2288
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:41,319
money you all know who you

2289
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:45,359
are um and then we received an anonymous

2290
02:32:41,319 --> 02:32:45,359
donation in the mail for

2291
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:54,479
$15,000 Plus

2292
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:57,720
we made a little over $10,000 from our

2293
02:32:54,479 --> 02:33:01,160
social media fundraiser our end of year

2294
02:32:57,720 --> 02:33:04,120
campaign so if you add all of that up

2295
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:06,880
it's quite a large amount of

2296
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:09,200
money and we're working on Distributing

2297
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:10,960
that in the best way possible so that

2298
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:14,479
the people that do need it in our

2299
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:14,479
community do receive

2300
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:23,600

perimenopause and menopause for the last

2332
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:02,279
four decades while also treating other

2333
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:05,080
hormone conditions such as low

2334
02:35:02,279 --> 02:35:07,120
testosterone in men thyroid disease

2335
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:09,720
adrenal deficiency and metabolic

2336
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:12,200
disorders instead of just treating only

2337
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:14,640
the symptoms of a patient's condition

2338
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:16,560
her approach goes to the root cause and

2339
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:19,040
balancing of the deficiencies that can

2340
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:24,200
lead to degenerative diseases later in

2341
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:26,800
life yay Dr thank you hello beloved

2342
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:29,040
followers of Anthony let's give it up

2343
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:29,040
for

2344
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:36,800
Anthony yay beloved Anthony so w how

2345
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:38,600
fitting is this that we're all here in

2346
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:41,200
the City of Angels when we have that

2347
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:44,880
angel amongst us so

2348
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:48,640
welcome medicine needs to

2349
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:50,439
change and we are that change you are

2350
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:52,720
that change

2351
02:35:50,439 --> 02:35:55,479
because the era has changed in medicine

2352
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:58,640
over the last 30 years the way we

2353
02:35:55,479 --> 02:36:02,560
practice medicine must change we need to

2354
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:07,120
get to the core or the root causes of

2355
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:09,920
Aging now what are those number one

2356
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:12,640
toxicity who what is Anthony doing he's

2357
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:16,120
going to detox the entire world and I

2358
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:19,359
certainly follow his detox number two

2359
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:22,279
imbalanced hormones hormones are our

2360
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:25,880
body body software and when men reach

2361
02:36:22,279 --> 02:36:27,760
about 50 or 45 their testosterone tanks

2362
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:29,640
and oh my God they become irritable they

2363
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:33,080
get belly fat they develop heart disease

2364
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:35,760
and all kinds of things so women start

2365
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:38,560
to go into per menopause in their late

2366
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:41,439
30s and that's really a problem because

2367
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:44,760
when our hormones decrease up go the

2368
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:46,560
core root causes of diseases so the core

2369
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:49,080
root causes are balance your hormones

2370
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:50,640
you know imbalanced hormones toxicity

2371
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:53,680
inflam

2372
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:56,120
and stress when you have those four

2373
02:36:53,680 --> 02:37:00,439
components present in your

2374
02:36:56,120 --> 02:37:02,399
body diseases arise we feel terrible I

2375
02:37:00,439 --> 02:37:04,840
take care of so many patients who can't

2376
02:37:02,399 --> 02:37:06,279
get out of bed yeah they'll get out of

2377
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:09,120
bed get their kids off to school but

2378
02:37:06,279 --> 02:37:12,000
then they go right back to bed so if we

2379
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:13,359
address those core root causes what do

2380
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,560
we have

2381
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:19,680
Vitality energy good sleep we age

2382
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:22,439
beautifully with beautiful skin and

2383
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:25,560
bones and hair and we don't develop the

2384
02:37:22,439 --> 02:37:27,040
diseases like cancer heart disease the

2385
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:29,920
number one cause of death in women and

2386
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:31,720
men we don't develop all the autoimmune

2387
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:34,680
diseases that Anthony has also talked

2388
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:36,960
about nor do we develop the diseases of

2389
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:40,439
inflammation you know all the arthriti

2390
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:45,479
and the body pain that we have

2391
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:48,160
so medicine needs to address who we are

2392
02:37:45,479 --> 02:37:50,920
and first of all we're Spiritual Beings

2393
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:52,840
we come from source we're also emotional

2394
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:56,399
beings especially the women that I work

2395
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:59,359
with we're emotional and our thoughts

2396
02:37:56,399 --> 02:38:01,920
create our emotions create our reality

2397
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:03,720
and our health so when we can change our

2398
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:04,760
thoughts the emotions change and our

2399
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:06,439
reality

2400
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:09,439
changes

2401
02:38:06,439 --> 02:38:13,720
also what I've learned over the last 40

2402
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:15,800
years of practice is that medicine as we

2403
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:19,120
practice it in the western world is

2404
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:20,120
about 80 years old when was Penicillin

2405
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:24,160
invented

2406
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:28,000
1928 when was the first patient treated

2407
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:30,439
1945 so how can we as doctors and as

2408
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:33,080
practitioners in Western medicine come

2409
02:38:30,439 --> 02:38:35,319
on with this arrogance I know what to do

2410
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:37,000
you you be quiet I know the answer so

2411
02:38:35,319 --> 02:38:40,880
this is not the

2412
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:42,920
way we need humility and we need

2413
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:45,240
partnership with our

2414
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:47,080
patients I can't approach a patient

2415
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:49,720
without knowing what his goals are or

2416
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:52,880
her goals are and I want to know know

2417
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:55,000
what's important to you how do you want

2418
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:59,800
to address your health

2419
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:04,840
concerns so arrogance has got to stop we

2420
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:08,920
need to really age in a way where we are

2421
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:11,520
increasing our biological wellness we

2422
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:14,080
can't create a different chronological

2423
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:17,319
age I'll always be this age but in terms

2424
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:20,920
of biologically addressing all those

2425
02:39:17,319 --> 02:39:23,080
core root causes we can create Miracles

2426
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:26,279
so our biological age is sometimes 30

2427
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:28,800
years older or 30 years younger so what

2428
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:30,600
goes into creating better biology

2429
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:34,720
balancing your hormones getting rid of

2430
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:34,720
inflammation decreasing stress the core

2431
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:40,520
causes one of the pearls I've learned in

2432
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:44,040
medicine is that and I've done this for

2433
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:46,880
for almost 40 years is that when you

2434
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:50,600
balance your hormones back to youthful

2435
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:52,920
levels or preserve your hormones

2436
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:55,080
diseases just fall away now what are

2437
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:57,359
some of the symptoms of women who are

2438
02:39:55,080 --> 02:40:00,840
going through menopause oh we sweat we

2439
02:39:57,359 --> 02:40:03,479
can't sleep we're Moody we're crying

2440
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:06,520
angry I think some of you know it many

2441
02:40:03,479 --> 02:40:09,040
of you are my patients and we don't need

2442
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:11,680
to live that way because once you go

2443
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:14,880
into menopause you stay that way your

2444
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:17,800
whole life so what do we want to do we

2445
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:20,600
want to prevent the decline of our

2446
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:24,319
ovaries and of our thyroid and of our

2447
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:28,720
adrenal glands and detoxification is

2448
02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:32,040
essential we're so toxic they we've done

2449
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:34,319
uh W I would say rather Innovative

2450
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:37,479
people in medicine have done biopsies of

2451
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:40,680
muscle to see how toxic we are and every

2452
02:40:37,479 --> 02:40:43,399
single one of us is filled with toxicity

2453
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:45,000
does Western Medicine address that even

2454
02:40:43,399 --> 02:40:48,080
with one

2455
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,000
suggestion in our arrogance we don't but

2456
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:52,640
Anthony is doing that and he's done it

2457
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,359
successfully for many many years and as

2458
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:57,439
I deal with patients and put them on the

2459
02:40:54,359 --> 02:41:00,640
detox diet his diet and work with them I

2460
02:40:57,439 --> 02:41:02,439
see real Miracles occur so balance your

2461
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:04,640
hormones back to youthful levels and

2462
02:41:02,439 --> 02:41:08,240
prevent the decline by

2463
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:10,399
detoxifying now people think very

2464
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:12,399
frequently that we develop diseases due

2465
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:17,840
to our

2466
02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:19,720
genes not true guys 90% of diseases come

2467
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:21,840
from lifestyle

2468
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:23,720
so what do we need to do we need to

2469
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:25,319
sleep eight hours eat that great diet

2470
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:29,600
that Anthony talks about and that I talk

2471
02:41:25,319 --> 02:41:32,359
about we need to uh get some exercise

2472
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:36,040
think good thoughts meditate decrease

2473
02:41:32,359 --> 02:41:39,520
our stress so when we do these things

2474
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:42,600
Miracles can occur we don't need to go

2475
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:45,279
downhill we don't need to have a decline

2476
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:47,960
in our hormones so our thyroid gland I

2477
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:49,880
actually wrote the forward to anon's uh

2478
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:52,840
medical medium book

2479
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:57,000
and yeah it was it was a real eye opener

2480
02:41:52,840 --> 02:42:00,040
for me uh so when we uh balance our

2481
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,600
thyroid hormones by detoxification I

2482
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:04,600
would say the number one cause is as

2483
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:06,920
Anthony says it's it's viruses and also

2484
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:09,560
toxicity that cause our glands and our

2485
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:13,840
hormones to decline so what happens when

2486
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:16,359
we lose our thyroid well we get tired we

2487
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:18,760
gain 20 30 pounds the brain is foggy we

2488
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:21,439
get sad we cry and what does Western

2489
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:26,479
medicine do well first of all they

2490
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:29,000
ignore and Miss 40% of low thyroid

2491
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:30,960
conditions I come on 40% of us are

2492
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,960
walking around with low thyroid and

2493
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,960
we're given

2494
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:37,880
anti-depressants we're given uh you know

2495
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:40,520
adol to make the brain work better so

2496
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:43,200
these are incorrect

2497
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:46,040
Solutions we can't keep on practicing

2498
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:48,720
medicine this way so the thyroid gland

2499
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:50,279
is important the adrenal glands are very

2500
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:52,120
important and I work a lot with my

2501
02:42:50,279 --> 02:42:54,920
patients on that they little glands that

2502
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:57,880
sit right back on the kidneys and when

2503
02:42:54,920 --> 02:43:00,240
we have stress you know stress kills

2504
02:42:57,880 --> 02:43:02,840
stress causes diseases then what happens

2505
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:07,200
is those hormones soar they go really

2506
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:07,960
high and then slowly they tank and when

2507
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:11,479
they

2508
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:13,840
tank all the symptoms of fatigue and

2509
02:43:11,479 --> 02:43:15,960
anger and irritability and lots of

2510
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:18,279
weight gain start to

2511
02:43:15,960 --> 02:43:20,240
arise so if you have one hormone

2512
02:43:18,279 --> 02:43:22,439
abnormality okay okay well we can maybe

2513
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:24,920
deal with the two hormone abnormalities

2514
02:43:22,439 --> 02:43:27,160
not so good three hormone abnormalities

2515
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:31,439
were tank plus you throw in a virus like

2516
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:33,359
Cy omegal virus or Epstein bar and we're

2517
02:43:31,439 --> 02:43:35,840
just we're

2518
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:37,640
dying so we want to maintain our

2519
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:40,399
hormonal balance now I want to tell you

2520
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:43,080
how I met Anthony because I think it is

2521
02:43:40,399 --> 02:43:45,680
such a touching story a patient came in

2522
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:48,720
and she said Prudence I have a gift for

2523
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:51,399
you and it's like you do I'm a little

2524
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:53,359
shy receiving giest but oh thank you and

2525
02:43:51,399 --> 02:43:55,439
she slapped that medical medium book

2526
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:58,000
right in my hand I looked at I thought

2527
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:01,520
medical medium ah there's a long

2528
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:04,080
tradition in Western and Eastern uh

2529
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:06,359
medicine of having people who see the

2530
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:08,840
truth and who know for example the

2531
02:44:06,359 --> 02:44:11,560
medicine men directly in contact with

2532
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:13,720
God and they helped the tribes it it

2533
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:15,080
goes back thousands of years so medical

2534
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:17,640
medium oh my goodness this is

2535
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:20,240
interesting so I got home and I was

2536
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:23,399
really so first of all I was interested

2537
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:25,880
because I know that there's lots of

2538
02:44:23,399 --> 02:44:27,680
different ways to obtain information and

2539
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:29,279
it's probably not from the double blind

2540
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:31,000
studies I mean that's important but it's

2541
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:32,560
also from other media so I got home

2542
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,080
looked through the book and I thought

2543
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:38,720
this is very interesting and I turned

2544
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:42,120
the book over and there was a uh a

2545
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:44,200
little um I would say it was sort of a a

2546
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:48,040
tribute to Anthony from one of my dear

2547
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:51,040
friends Alejandra anger he's Dr

2548
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:52,160
clean re resets the gut and he's a dear

2549
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:55,279
friend and I called him up I said

2550
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:59,439
Alejandro who's this medical medium and

2551
02:44:55,279 --> 02:45:02,120
he said oh Prudence he is the

2552
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:05,760
best he knows how to really help your

2553
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:08,240

right but nobody knows what that's like

3030
03:47:59,159 --> 03:48:04,000
unless they had it themselves so it's

3031
03:48:02,319 --> 03:48:07,319
really hard out there I know many of you

3032
03:48:04,000 --> 03:48:08,479
have run into that and then it's the you

3033
03:48:07,319 --> 03:48:13,359
look

3034
03:48:08,479 --> 03:48:15,520
great but you don't feel great right you

3035
03:48:13,359 --> 03:48:17,239
know you look good on the outside

3036
03:48:15,520 --> 03:48:20,680
meanwhile you feel like you're dying

3037
03:48:17,239 --> 03:48:23,080
inside right and so many people

3038
03:48:20,680 --> 03:48:25,239
experience that but these are just a

3039
03:48:23,080 --> 03:48:27,479
couple of things and then there's a

3040
03:48:25,239 --> 03:48:28,840
resistance right I want to eat healthier

3041
03:48:27,479 --> 03:48:30,479
I want to take care of myself I want to

3042
03:48:28,840 --> 03:48:31,920
do this I want to drink the celery juice

3043
03:48:30,479 --> 03:48:33,239
and then there's people around you or

3044
03:48:31,920 --> 03:48:35,040
people that you bump into that are like

3045
03:48:33,239 --> 03:48:37,239
don't do that don't do

3046
03:48:35,040 --> 03:48:38,239
that that's a whole another struggle all

3047
03:48:37,239 --> 03:48:40,680
on its

3048
03:48:38,239 --> 03:48:46,000
own and then there's the inner inner

3049
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:46,000
inner struggle the inner struggle of

3050
03:48:47,080 --> 03:48:50,840
is anybody listening to me is anybody

3051
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:52,479
hearing me do they understand me how

3052
03:48:50,840 --> 03:48:54,319
come they're misunderstanding me how

3053
03:48:52,479 --> 03:48:56,800
come they're judging me right how many

3054
03:48:54,319 --> 03:48:59,560
people go through

3055
03:48:56,800 --> 03:49:01,319
that when we're indestructible and

3056
03:48:59,560 --> 03:49:02,130
everything's fine and we feel good and

3057
03:49:01,319 --> 03:49:03,319

oyster and then you get sick boom and

3066
03:49:23,120 --> 03:49:29,159
then the real fight the real struggle

3067
03:49:25,640 --> 03:49:30,800
happens I know people they work hard

3068
03:49:29,159 --> 03:49:33,319
every day to achieve

3069
03:49:30,800 --> 03:49:35,040
things and they do things every day but

3070
03:49:33,319 --> 03:49:36,720
when you're sick and you're chronically

3071
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:39,239
strug struggling and suffering it's

3072
03:49:36,720 --> 03:49:40,399
another story it's a battle no one

3073
03:49:39,239 --> 03:49:43,680
understands out there unless they've

3074
03:49:40,399 --> 03:49:45,720
been there before you can't compare it

3075
03:49:43,680 --> 03:49:47,199

3076
03:49:45,720 --> 03:49:50,239
yeah I'm working out in the gym I'm in

3077
03:49:47,199 --> 03:49:51,960

believe how hard it is aw I'm like

3079
03:49:51,960 --> 03:49:55,840
that's

3080
03:49:52,840 --> 03:49:57,680
nothing nothing compared to can't get

school can't go do this can't do

3084
03:50:01,840 --> 03:50:07,040
that that struggle and then the struggle

3085
03:50:05,359 --> 03:50:09,120
of no one understanding because they're

3086
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:10,439
not there with you because they don't

3087
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:12,000
know what it's like sure we have

3088
03:50:10,439 --> 03:50:14,399
relatives around us and friends and

3089
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:16,120
family that that they they connect we we

3090
03:50:14,399 --> 03:50:17,120

3091
03:50:16,120 --> 03:50:21,159
people

don't many times it's just I'm alone in

3093
03:50:21,159 --> 03:50:24,960
this and then you see people they seem

3094
03:50:23,239 --> 03:50:26,840

03:50:24,960 --> 03:50:28,840

living it up and you're

03:50:38,960 --> 03:50:44,040
struggling it's all it's all difficult

3104
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:47,439
and it's what I call rising out of the

3105
03:50:44,040 --> 03:50:50,260
ashes cuz when you come back from that

3106
03:50:47,439 --> 03:50:52,080
that's gold medal

3107
03:50:50,260 --> 03:50:53,640
[Applause]

3108
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:57,399
stuff

3109
03:50:53,640 --> 03:50:59,760
I I talk to a lot of Olympic athletes

3110
03:50:57,399 --> 03:51:01,479
the ones that get sick for the first

3111
03:50:59,760 --> 03:51:02,800
time in their life they're working out

3112
03:51:01,479 --> 03:51:04,920
every day they're doing their thing they

3113
03:51:02,800 --> 03:51:06,239
got their trainers they got their agents

3114
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:08,279
they got their publicists they got

3115
03:51:06,239 --> 03:51:09,560
everybody they're doing it all day long

3116
03:51:08,279 --> 03:51:10,920
then they get into the Olympics they're

3117
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:13,040
doing it doing they get a silver medal

3118
03:51:10,920 --> 03:51:16,120
gold medal bronze medal and then they

3119
03:51:13,040 --> 03:51:18,880
get sick

3120
03:51:16,120 --> 03:51:20,840
and then they say Anthony

3121
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:24,199
aw I didn't

3122
03:51:20,840 --> 03:51:26,560
know I had it made I got up in the

3123
03:51:24,199 --> 03:51:29,319
morning made my protein shake did my

3124
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:31,760
workout trained all day had my trainer

3125
03:51:29,319 --> 03:51:33,880
with me went to bed cuz I was tired

3126
03:51:31,760 --> 03:51:37,120
started the next day over but that was a

3127
03:51:33,880 --> 03:51:38,880
joke compared to being sick and

3128
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:42,560
something being

3129
03:51:38,880 --> 03:51:45,439
wrong and I talk to Olympic athletes

3130
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:47,840
that aren't sick yet

3131
03:51:45,439 --> 03:51:50,040
and I say I get it I know what you

3132
03:51:47,840 --> 03:51:53,199
achieved it's amazing I'm proud of you

3133
03:51:50,040 --> 03:51:54,399
but it's nothing compared to being sick

3134
03:51:53,199 --> 03:51:57,399
and

3135
03:51:54,399 --> 03:51:59,600
bedridden stuck in a wheelchair not

3136
03:51:57,399 --> 03:52:02,800
knowing what's wrong legs don't work

3137
03:51:59,600 --> 03:52:05,560
arms don't work something's off battery

3138
03:52:02,800 --> 03:52:07,720
of tests how many people went to so many

3139
03:52:05,560 --> 03:52:09,439
doctors which we have to have doctors we

3140
03:52:07,720 --> 03:52:12,199
need them but how many people went to so

3141
03:52:09,439 --> 03:52:16,319
many doctors had a battery of tests have

3142
03:52:12,199 --> 03:52:16,319
been through it all right

3143
03:52:17,560 --> 03:52:21,159
this

3144
03:52:18,840 --> 03:52:23,960
is an achievement you got to patch

3145
03:52:21,159 --> 03:52:25,479
yourself on the back you truly do and

3146
03:52:23,960 --> 03:52:28,040
maybe your symptoms are mild maybe

3147
03:52:25,479 --> 03:52:30,640
they're severe but either way and then

3148
03:52:28,040 --> 03:52:32,800
it's how we feel about it some people

3149
03:52:30,640 --> 03:52:36,040

3150
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:37,080

03:59:40,760 --> 03:59:46,880
before right were we here

3325
03:59:44,760 --> 03:59:48,600

is in the medical medium community and

3339
04:00:16,720 --> 04:00:21,399

3340
04:00:18,840 --> 04:00:21,399

04:00:22,000 --> 04:00:28,720

3358
04:01:08,000 --> 04:01:11,080
some compassion going just because I

3359
04:01:09,760 --> 04:01:12,479
talk to Spirit of compassion doesn't

3360
04:01:11,080 --> 04:01:14,560
mean I'm the most compassionate person

3361
04:01:12,479 --> 04:01:16,199
when I was younger I told of compassion

3362
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:17,840
I don't want to do this I was 10 years

3363
04:01:16,199 --> 04:01:21,439
old saying I don't care about people

3364
04:01:17,840 --> 04:01:21,439
being sick I want to ride my

3365
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:25,800

3367
04:01:25,800 --> 04:01:30,120
to be here for people you have to care

3368
04:01:28,279 --> 04:01:31,680
it's critical and I said okay I will

3369
04:01:30,120 --> 04:01:34,000
make it a point that I always care from

3370
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:34,000
here on

3371
04:01:35,410 --> 04:01:40,389

out I I hear that word compassion out

3373
04:01:45,560 --> 04:01:49,080
there and the first thing I think about

3374
04:01:47,600 --> 04:01:51,159
is the medical medium Community being

3375
04:01:49,080 --> 04:01:52,720
the most compassionate people out there

3376
04:01:51,159 --> 04:01:54,279
that's the first thing I think I hear

3377
04:01:52,720 --> 04:01:56,359
somebody say the word compassion out

3378
04:01:54,279 --> 04:01:57,840
there and I instantly go right to the

3379
04:01:56,359 --> 04:01:59,319
medical medium community in my mind and

3380
04:01:57,840 --> 04:02:01,040
said no no no no no no the most

3381
04:01:59,319 --> 04:02:02,640
compassionate people there are on this

3382
04:02:01,040 --> 04:02:05,760
planet is the medical medium Community I

3383
04:02:02,640 --> 04:02:05,760
don't want anybody to forget

04:02:11,600 --> 04:02:15,080
bad person always remember that so one

3388
04:02:13,920 --> 04:02:17,359
thing that Spirit of compassion always

3389
04:02:15,080 --> 04:02:19,159
told me at the beginning is you tell

3390
04:02:17,359 --> 04:02:21,199
someone who's going through this and

3391
04:02:19,159 --> 04:02:23,640
moving forward that you didn't do

3392
04:02:21,199 --> 04:02:25,800
anything wrong and it's not your fault

3393
04:02:23,640 --> 04:02:27,199
it's not your fault do not forget that

3394
04:02:25,800 --> 04:02:29,040
you make sure you have it in the heart

3395
04:02:27,199 --> 04:02:30,960
is if you think it's your fault and

3396
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:33,560
you're the problem and you caused it and

3397
04:02:30,960 --> 04:02:35,600
you're a bad person we are not in a good

3398
04:02:33,560 --> 04:02:38,199
place you have to understand that has to

3399
04:02:35,600 --> 04:02:38,199
be fixed

3400
04:02:41,479 --> 04:02:45,199
immediately every morning you wake up

3401
04:02:43,439 --> 04:02:46,720
you say no I'm a good person I didn't

3402
04:02:45,199 --> 04:02:48,279
get sick because I'm a bad person I

3403
04:02:46,720 --> 04:02:50,319
didn't create this and I didn't cause it

3404
04:02:48,279 --> 04:02:52,640
and guess what my body is not destroying

3405
04:02:50,319 --> 04:02:54,279
itself my body is not attacking itself I

3406
04:02:52,640 --> 04:02:56,120
got diagnosed with autoimmune and they

3407
04:02:54,279 --> 04:02:58,359
told me my body is destroying itself no

3408
04:02:56,120 --> 04:02:58,359

3409
04:02:59,080 --> 04:03:03,600
not always

3410
04:03:01,239 --> 04:03:06,159

it and it wasn't because in a lifetime

3431
04:03:51,439 --> 04:03:55,319
before this you were a bad person and

3432
04:03:53,239 --> 04:03:57,960
had your head chopped off in England or

3433
04:03:55,319 --> 04:04:01,880
in someplace

3434
04:03:57,960 --> 04:04:03,439
else or 500 years ago so you were I

3435
04:04:01,880 --> 04:04:06,319
don't know burned at the stake because

3436
04:04:03,439 --> 04:04:06,319
you were a terrible

3437
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:12,880
person you did not create your

3438
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:14,239
illness okay and it's not your fault

3439
04:04:12,880 --> 04:04:16,319
there's happen

3440
04:04:14,239 --> 04:04:19,239
there are certain circumstances that we

3441
04:04:16,319 --> 04:04:21,880
run into trouble with here on this

3442
04:04:19,239 --> 04:04:24,239
planet cuz this planet as we know is not

3443
04:04:21,880 --> 04:04:26,479
a fair place you tell you tell me if

3444
04:04:24,239 --> 04:04:30,040
this planet's a fair

3445
04:04:26,479 --> 04:04:32,479
place it's a beautiful place sure it's

3446
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:34,120
not always the fairest place so it's not

3447
04:04:32,479 --> 04:04:36,319
our fault when we get sick or something

3448
04:04:34,120 --> 04:04:38,479
happens or we get exposure or we get

3449
04:04:36,319 --> 04:04:41,159
something in us that we it just we

3450
04:04:38,479 --> 04:04:43,279
didn't do it to ourselves it happened

3451
04:04:41,159 --> 04:04:45,479
for a lot of reasons even if we think we

3452
04:04:43,279 --> 04:04:47,479
did it to to ourself it's not true

3453
04:04:45,479 --> 04:04:50,600
something happened emotionally something

3454
04:04:47,479 --> 04:04:53,319
happened me mentally some kind of wounds

3455
04:04:50,600 --> 04:04:55,040
from the past that aren't your fault can

3456
04:04:53,319 --> 04:04:57,720
also get in the way but that's not you

3457
04:04:55,040 --> 04:05:00,720
creating it those are

3458
04:04:57,720 --> 04:05:04,239
injuries

3459
04:05:00,720 --> 04:05:08,319
right but keep in mind that no matter

3460
04:05:04,239 --> 04:05:11,319
what okay have compassion for yourselves

3461
04:05:08,319 --> 04:05:14,640
every day don't kick yourself in the ass

3462
04:05:11,319 --> 04:05:18,120
whatever you do don't do that

3463
04:05:14,640 --> 04:05:21,159
and if you fall off course or fall off

3464
04:05:18,120 --> 04:05:23,479
the wagon and you eat something that's

3465
04:05:21,159 --> 04:05:25,600
not helping you and you drink something

3466
04:05:23,479 --> 04:05:28,120
that's not helping you that's okay

3467
04:05:25,600 --> 04:05:30,520
that's okay it happens to the best of us

3468
04:05:28,120 --> 04:05:32,920
because this is a hard place to live in

3469
04:05:30,520 --> 04:05:34,680
this world and I understand if we trip

3470
04:05:32,920 --> 04:05:36,720
and fall a little bit and we eat

3471
04:05:34,680 --> 04:05:38,600
something and drink something and we do

3472
04:05:36,720 --> 04:05:42,080
something like Dr NES he drinks alcohol

3473
04:05:38,600 --> 04:05:42,080
every single day

3474
04:05:46,960 --> 04:05:53,880
yeah and Dr Joby who sells $53,000

3475
04:05:50,560 --> 04:05:56,040
bottles of wine in his own Winery and

3476
04:05:53,880 --> 04:05:58,600
wine

3477
04:05:56,040 --> 04:06:00,600
estate keep in

3478
04:05:58,600 --> 04:06:04,040
mind keep in

3479
04:06:00,600 --> 04:06:06,880
mind if we get tripped up and we're

3480
04:06:04,040 --> 04:06:10,199
doing something that's not helping us

3481
04:06:06,880 --> 04:06:13,120
it's okay we can get back on the horse

3482
04:06:10,199 --> 04:06:14,120
when we can we can customize stuff for

3483
04:06:13,120 --> 04:06:16,680
ourselves

3484
04:06:14,120 --> 04:06:18,840
out of the information we can be good to

3485
04:06:16,680 --> 04:06:21,239
ourselves don't beat yourself up don't

3486
04:06:18,840 --> 04:06:23,520
be hard on yourself whatever you do do

3487

naked in front of the audience that

3676

[Applause]

3761
04:18:36,640 --> 04:18:42,000
Applause one of the most common

3762
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:45,239
questions I get as a medical doctor is

3763
04:18:42,000 --> 04:18:46,920
how can you recile Medical Science with

3764
04:18:45,239 --> 04:18:49,600
a guy who hears a voice in his head and

3765
04:18:46,920 --> 04:18:51,640
he's not even a doctor so I say to you

3766
04:18:49,600 --> 04:18:54,040
well like many of you I've explored

3767
04:18:51,640 --> 04:18:55,840
these alternative treatments I've I've

3768
04:18:54,040 --> 04:18:58,439
spent a lot of money I spent a lot of

3769
04:18:55,840 --> 04:19:00,000
time and you know what Anthony said

3770
04:18:58,439 --> 04:19:01,199
about oh somebody's telling you that you

3771
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:03,640
died in past life and somebody chopped

3772
04:19:01,199 --> 04:19:04,880
your head off that was us and I was like

3773
04:19:03,640 --> 04:19:06,840
how did you know that I never told him

3774
04:19:04,880 --> 04:19:08,319
that how did you know that they told me

3775
04:19:06,840 --> 04:19:09,920
that because of the law of attraction

3776
04:19:08,319 --> 04:19:12,159
that I attracted to a family member of

3777
04:19:09,920 --> 04:19:14,640
mine I'm like how did I attract this

3778
04:19:12,159 --> 04:19:17,359
crap to my family I don't understand

3779
04:19:14,640 --> 04:19:19,760
that so whatever Anthony says I mean I

3780
04:19:17,359 --> 04:19:21,159
learned from Anthony like The Compassion

3781
04:19:19,760 --> 04:19:23,319
that he feels for people he feels what

3782
04:19:21,159 --> 04:19:24,600
they have and I had a little glimpse of

3783
04:19:23,319 --> 04:19:27,520
that through through his writings and

3784
04:19:24,600 --> 04:19:29,479
his lives so I very much thank you for

3785
04:19:27,520 --> 04:19:30,960
that um you know many of these doctors

3786
04:19:29,479 --> 04:19:32,800
are and practitioners they're not bad

3787
04:19:30,960 --> 04:19:34,040
people they have a belief system you

3788
04:19:32,800 --> 04:19:36,720
can't I can't fault them for trying to

3789
04:19:34,040 --> 04:19:38,399
earn a living I can't uh fault them for

3790
04:19:36,720 --> 04:19:40,520
not knowing the right

3791
04:19:38,399 --> 04:19:42,239
information um and I was immediately

3792
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:44,399
drawn to Anthony after the first Hay

3793
04:19:42,239 --> 04:19:46,199
House Radio podcast you guys remember

3794
04:19:44,399 --> 04:19:47,680
that stuff he get on the phone and you

3795
04:19:46,199 --> 04:19:48,640
talk to people like oh my God this guy

3796
04:19:47,680 --> 04:19:50,399
know what he's talking about how does he

3797
04:19:48,640 --> 04:19:52,680
know this stuff he's not even a doctor

3798
04:19:50,399 --> 04:19:56,040
it's amazing so I was really intrigued

3799
04:19:52,680 --> 04:19:57,760
by that and and um you know I I

3800
04:19:56,040 --> 04:19:59,680
Implement some of this stuff you know a

3801
04:19:57,760 --> 04:20:01,560
little celery juice here get off gluten

3802
04:19:59,680 --> 04:20:03,439
dairy eggs and people feel great I I

3803
04:20:01,560 --> 04:20:05,199
look like a genius you know I tell my

3804
04:20:03,439 --> 04:20:08,479
patients like you need to adrenally

3805
04:20:05,199 --> 04:20:10,720
snack so you can calorically stack so

3806
04:20:08,479 --> 04:20:13,080
that the sugar doesn't go whack and

3807
04:20:10,720 --> 04:20:15,640
viruses attack

3808
04:20:13,080 --> 04:20:18,239
and and hopefully they they learned that

3809
04:20:15,640 --> 04:20:21,279
um but like for instance there was one

3810
04:20:18,239 --> 04:20:23,239
one 36-year-old woman she was I think it

3811
04:20:21,279 --> 04:20:24,119
was like four rounds of IVF over eight

3812
04:20:23,239 --> 04:20:25,840
years or something like this I can't

3813
04:20:24,119 --> 04:20:29,119
remember the details now because I'm on

3814
04:20:25,840 --> 04:20:30,359
stage and I met her for the first time I

3815
04:20:29,119 --> 04:20:32,560
didn't even change her th do of

3816
04:20:30,359 --> 04:20:34,800
medication I told her start some celery

3817
04:20:32,560 --> 04:20:38,119
juice get off the Troublemaker foods and

3818
04:20:34,800 --> 04:20:40,600
guess what a few months later prar right

3819
04:20:38,119 --> 04:20:43,159
she was pregnant thank Dr fan thank you

3820
04:20:40,600 --> 04:20:45,319
for getting me pregnant I'm like don't

3821
04:20:43,159 --> 04:20:47,800
say that you're you're going to get my

3822
04:20:45,319 --> 04:20:49,399
medical license revoked but we have

3823
04:20:47,800 --> 04:20:50,760
countless stores like this right I mean

3824
04:20:49,399 --> 04:20:52,080
not everybody does medical mean people

3825
04:20:50,760 --> 04:20:53,560
come my to my office and they're like

3826
04:20:52,080 --> 04:20:55,640
eating barbecue and they're not going to

3827
04:20:53,560 --> 04:20:57,439
do this stuff but at least I try and I

3828
04:20:55,640 --> 04:21:00,279
sleep better knowing that I've tried for

3829
04:20:57,439 --> 04:21:02,479
them and for my own conscious

3830
04:21:00,279 --> 04:21:05,119
so

3831
04:21:02,479 --> 04:21:07,479
um you don't need to spend thousands of

3832
04:21:05,119 --> 04:21:08,880
dollars on these these tests right you

3833
04:21:07,479 --> 04:21:10,319
know there's something called um in

3834
04:21:08,880 --> 04:21:12,760
clinical practice called weighing the

3835
04:21:10,319 --> 04:21:15,279
risks versus the benefits of something

3836
04:21:12,760 --> 04:21:17,080
so for instance penicillin penicillin

3837
04:21:15,279 --> 04:21:18,000
can help you clear an infection right

3838
04:21:17,080 --> 04:21:20,080
like you've got infection you might

3839
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:22,680
stepsis you might die it can save you

3840
04:21:20,080 --> 04:21:25,119
but also you can get

3841
04:21:22,680 --> 04:21:28,560
anaphylaxis so you always weigh the risk

3842
04:21:25,119 --> 04:21:30,399
benefits of a treatment modality celery

3843
04:21:28,560 --> 04:21:33,520
juice what are the risk benefit ratios

3844
04:21:30,399 --> 04:21:35,840
of celery juice I got to go wash the

3845
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:37,239
celery I got to cut the celery I got to

3846
04:21:35,840 --> 04:21:40,239
poop in my

3847
04:21:37,239 --> 04:21:41,600
pants but it also clears the skin it

3848
04:21:40,239 --> 04:21:43,080
helps the liver it helps the blood

3849
04:21:41,600 --> 04:21:45,960
pressure go down I know had a miracle

3850
04:21:43,080 --> 04:21:47,520
with blood pressure in my family so

3851
04:21:45,960 --> 04:21:49,159
that's it's important to weigh the risk

3852
04:21:47,520 --> 04:21:49,920
benefit ratio of a certain modality when

3853
04:21:49,159 --> 04:21:52,040
you're talking about foods and

3854
04:21:49,920 --> 04:21:54,479
supplements I mean not a lot of side

3855
04:21:52,040 --> 04:21:56,119
effects uh that you can tell about right

3856
04:21:54,479 --> 04:21:58,080
um but some everybody's sensitive so

3857
04:21:56,119 --> 04:21:59,600
there there's that to consider right

3858
04:21:58,080 --> 04:22:02,880
let's talk about exercise compared you

3859
04:21:59,600 --> 04:22:06,279
know risk management Dr fan when I

3860
04:22:02,880 --> 04:22:08,640
exercise I get wet on my skin and my

3861
04:22:06,279 --> 04:22:10,520
heart goes nuts and I get adrenaline R

3862
04:22:08,640 --> 04:22:11,920
so I can't exercise at all I'm like no

3863
04:22:10,520 --> 04:22:13,279
exercise is good for you long term if

3864
04:22:11,920 --> 04:22:15,080
you can if if you can do it if you don't

3865
04:22:13,279 --> 04:22:16,760
renally stress yourself so you always

3866
04:22:15,080 --> 04:22:18,720
have to think about the the risk that's

3867
04:22:16,760 --> 04:22:20,800
how you say look look the doctor's going

3868
04:22:18,720 --> 04:22:23,159
to put you on medication or you can eat

3869
04:22:20,800 --> 04:22:25,159
better and you can add some celery juice

3870
04:22:23,159 --> 04:22:28,760
which one do you want to

3871
04:22:25,159 --> 04:22:31,080
do um but then a loved one says well

3872
04:22:28,760 --> 04:22:33,479
where is the scientific evidence for

3873
04:22:31,080 --> 04:22:35,960
this medical medium right after all mom

3874
04:22:33,479 --> 04:22:39,080
you the one who is recommending this

3875
04:22:35,960 --> 04:22:42,040
crystal energy infused enema or this

3876
04:22:39,080 --> 04:22:44,199
homeopathic feces and and that didn't

3877
04:22:42,040 --> 04:22:45,800
help your microbiome right you've seen

3878
04:22:44,199 --> 04:22:47,319
that you're seen your mom or dad like

3879
04:22:45,800 --> 04:22:48,760
they doing these crazy stuff right they

3880
04:22:47,319 --> 04:22:52,720
find medical meeting all of a sudden

3881
04:22:48,760 --> 04:22:55,319
this is the thing well you don't need uh

3882
04:22:52,720 --> 04:22:57,040
a randomized clinical trial to tell you

3883
04:22:55,319 --> 04:22:59,640
that you shouldn't go play with wild

3884
04:22:57,040 --> 04:23:01,680
bears okay it's kind of like no no no

3885
04:22:59,640 --> 04:23:03,640
our study shows that only less than 1%

3886
04:23:01,680 --> 04:23:05,880
of these participants did not get their

3887
04:23:03,640 --> 04:23:08,199
arm ripped off but you don't need to

3888
04:23:05,880 --> 04:23:12,600
know not to go play in traffic that you

3889
04:23:08,199 --> 04:23:14,199
know a study to tell you that so um

3890
04:23:12,600 --> 04:23:16,600
our you

3891
04:23:14,199 --> 04:23:18,520
know I'll tell you that as a fourth year

3892
04:23:16,600 --> 04:23:20,600
medical student when I was doing helping

3893
04:23:18,520 --> 04:23:21,960
uh doing research for a paper this poor

3894
04:23:20,600 --> 04:23:24,080
faculty Professor he was just trying to

3895
04:23:21,960 --> 04:23:26,319
publish so he could stay keep his job

3896
04:23:24,080 --> 04:23:29,119
and a lot of that that data was horrible

3897
04:23:26,319 --> 04:23:31,840
data that he he tried to publish and so

3898
04:23:29,119 --> 04:23:33,920
it happens a lot there are actual

3899
04:23:31,840 --> 04:23:36,159
Journal articles talking about the

3900
04:23:33,920 --> 04:23:38,680
benefit of celer juice and hypertension

3901
04:23:36,159 --> 04:23:40,159
uh while blueberry on dementia um but of

3902
04:23:38,680 --> 04:23:41,720
course the truth is you can find any

3903
04:23:40,159 --> 04:23:44,080
Journal article to support anything you

3904
04:23:41,720 --> 04:23:45,880
want you can cheer i cherry pick these

3905
04:23:44,080 --> 04:23:48,319
things when I post things on you know

3906
04:23:45,880 --> 04:23:50,520
social media so these are the same

3907
04:23:48,319 --> 04:23:52,560
influencers who use this information to

3908
04:23:50,520 --> 04:23:54,520
say you got to buy my collagen powder

3909
04:23:52,560 --> 04:23:57,279
you got to buy my you know electrolyte

3910
04:23:54,520 --> 04:23:59,319
formula or something like this get this

3911
04:23:57,279 --> 04:24:00,800
martial Angel that's a good name to have

3912
04:23:59,319 --> 04:24:02,439
a Marsha Angel who worked at the New

3913
04:24:00,800 --> 04:24:04,600
England Journal of Medicine for two

3914
04:24:02,439 --> 04:24:07,399
decades and became the chief editor said

3915
04:24:04,600 --> 04:24:09,199
this it is simply no longer possible to

3916
04:24:07,399 --> 04:24:10,880
believe much of the clinical research

3917
04:24:09,199 --> 04:24:12,600
that is published or to rely on the

3918
04:24:10,880 --> 04:24:14,920
Judgment of trusted Physicians

3919
04:24:12,600 --> 04:24:16,760
authoritative medical guidelines I take

3920
04:24:14,920 --> 04:24:18,800
no pleasure in this conclusion which I

3921
04:24:16,760 --> 04:24:20,399
reached slowly and reluctantly over my

3922
04:24:18,800 --> 04:24:22,960
two decades as an editor of the New

3923
04:24:20,399 --> 04:24:25,880
England general of medicine right or how

3924
04:24:22,960 --> 04:24:27,319
about this 2016 John Hopkin study

3925
04:24:25,880 --> 04:24:29,520
suggests that medical errors were the

3926
04:24:27,319 --> 04:24:31,840
third leading cause of death in the US

3927
04:24:29,520 --> 04:24:34,159
that is scary not to mention the people

3928
04:24:31,840 --> 04:24:35,119
who were like lose a left arm when they

3929
04:24:34,159 --> 04:24:37,319
were supposed to be the right arm that

3930
04:24:35,119 --> 04:24:38,840
they had supposed to cut you know did

3931
04:24:37,319 --> 04:24:40,840
you know that a recent study published

3932
04:24:38,840 --> 04:24:44,359
in the bush Journal of Psychology and

3933
04:24:40,840 --> 04:24:46,680
Behavioral Medicine showed that 96% of

3934
04:24:44,359 --> 04:24:49,239
participants in the study believe that

3935
04:24:46,680 --> 04:24:52,119
something was a scientific fact when an

3936
04:24:49,239 --> 04:24:54,880
actor spoke congruently and confidently

3937
04:24:52,119 --> 04:24:56,080
about a particular topic if one armor of

3938
04:24:54,880 --> 04:24:57,439
the in one armor of the study

3939
04:24:56,080 --> 04:24:59,520
respondents were told that birds are

3940
04:24:57,439 --> 04:25:02,000
gradually and secretly being replaced by

3941
04:24:59,520 --> 04:25:05,680
drones that work for the CIA to spy on

3942
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:07,520
people and people believe them now I

3943
04:25:05,680 --> 04:25:09,239
totally pulled that study on my butt

3944
04:25:07,520 --> 04:25:12,760
it's not real I made it up but it

3945
04:25:09,239 --> 04:25:14,920

Angels help you at every turn and I pray

4012
04:27:54,199 --> 04:27:58,960

4013
04:27:56,880 --> 04:28:01,399
to suck how many of you people have

4014
04:27:58,960 --> 04:28:03,640
things that suck in your life right

forward right and then the next hand the

4017
04:28:05,840 --> 04:28:11,040
next thing is the seed seed is to give

4018
04:28:08,080 --> 04:28:12,720
up something seed this this this idea

4019
04:28:11,040 --> 04:28:14,840
that the body wants to attack it itself

4020
04:28:12,720 --> 04:28:16,800
that you cannot heal that you have

4021
04:28:14,840 --> 04:28:20,720
faulty genes or something like this give

4022
04:28:16,800 --> 04:28:23,159
up that idea and then SE is in SED see

4023
04:28:20,720 --> 04:28:25,359
the thought that you can heal see the

4024
04:28:23,159 --> 04:28:28,239
thought of Tomorrow a better day the

4025
04:28:25,359 --> 04:28:31,560
vision of of of helping yourself and

4026
04:28:28,239 --> 04:28:32,840
others um read other people's stories of

4027
04:28:31,560 --> 04:28:34,640
how they healed when doctors and others

4028
04:28:32,840 --> 04:28:36,520
around them thought they were Nut Cases

4029
04:28:34,640 --> 04:28:38,279
because you'll get that confidence right

4030
04:28:36,520 --> 04:28:40,399
this is this is why these stories are so

4031
04:28:38,279 --> 04:28:41,840
inspiring uh because encourag other

4032
04:28:40,399 --> 04:28:44,279
people to believe your one story could

4033
04:28:41,840 --> 04:28:46,199
be one person in Germany or Finland who

4034
04:28:44,279 --> 04:28:47,880
heals because of this and we've seen

4035
04:28:46,199 --> 04:28:51,040
that happen

4036
04:28:47,880 --> 04:28:53,439
right class of 2024 he in class I'm

4037
04:28:51,040 --> 04:28:55,439
going to end on a cliche but instead of

4038
04:28:53,439 --> 04:28:57,520
telling you to spread your wings I'm

4039
04:28:55,439 --> 04:28:59,439
going to tell you to spread your adrenal

4040
04:28:57,520 --> 04:29:01,119
snacks throughout the day instead of

4041
04:28:59,439 --> 04:29:02,119
telling you to reach for the stars I'm

4042
04:29:01,119 --> 04:29:04,479
going to tell you to reach for the

4043
04:29:02,119 --> 04:29:06,479
stargazing meditation and forget the

4044
04:29:04,479 --> 04:29:08,119
boring advice that don't do it for money

4045
04:29:06,479 --> 04:29:10,080

symptoms and chronic and autoimmune

4214
04:50:55,480 --> 04:51:01,600
illness runs in my family and I have

4215
04:50:59,320 --> 04:51:04,280
family members who struggled very

4216
04:51:01,600 --> 04:51:06,760
greatly growing up and I watched people

4217
04:51:04,280 --> 04:51:09,558
in my family get bullied and

4218
04:51:06,760 --> 04:51:11,520
disrespected for their symptoms and the

4219
04:51:09,558 --> 04:51:14,600
world was an entirely different place

4220
04:51:11,520 --> 04:51:16,920
even just 10 years ago 15 years ago I

4221
04:51:14,600 --> 04:51:19,040
don't know who remembers there was no

4222
04:51:16,920 --> 04:51:22,000
information out there about what was

4223
04:51:19,040 --> 04:51:24,360
causing people's symptoms and it was

4224
04:51:22,000 --> 04:51:27,680
even really difficult to get diagnosed

4225
04:51:24,360 --> 04:51:30,360
with anything and so much of that has

4226
04:51:27,680 --> 04:51:33,040
changed now because of medical medium

4227
04:51:30,360 --> 04:51:36,920
information and the influence that it

4228
04:51:33,040 --> 04:51:39,520
has had upon the world the medical

4229
04:51:36,920 --> 04:51:41,040
industry the entire health profession

4230
04:51:39,520 --> 04:51:43,040
now people

4231
04:51:41,040 --> 04:51:45,600
who are just out there in the health

4232
04:51:43,040 --> 04:51:47,840
industry are talking about toxic heavy

4233
04:51:45,600 --> 04:51:50,080
metals they're talking about toxic heavy

4234
04:51:47,840 --> 04:51:52,040
metal DET they're talking about heavy

4235
04:51:50,080 --> 04:51:54,320
metal detox they're talking about celery

4236
04:51:52,040 --> 04:51:56,320
juice and even if they don't have full

4237
04:51:54,320 --> 04:51:58,840
information it just it's unbelievable

4238
04:51:56,320 --> 04:52:01,520
how much all of that has disseminated

4239
04:51:58,840 --> 04:52:04,600
out into the world and the health

4240
04:52:01,520 --> 04:52:07,240
industry and we've got doctors now where

4241
04:52:04,600 --> 04:52:09,200
it's it's common practice to test for

4242
04:52:07,240 --> 04:52:12,520
Epstein bar

4243
04:52:09,200 --> 04:52:14,558
virus right

4244
04:52:12,520 --> 04:52:17,160
who remembers how many of you H have had

4245
04:52:14,558 --> 04:52:19,360
an experience where you read it in his

4246
04:52:17,160 --> 04:52:21,480
books something about Epstein bar you

4247
04:52:19,360 --> 04:52:24,280
took it to your doctor and the doctor

4248
04:52:21,480 --> 04:52:26,878
looked at you like what Epstein bar

4249
04:52:24,280 --> 04:52:29,320
virus what do you mean and you couldn't

4250
04:52:26,878 --> 04:52:33,080
get tested you couldn't get diagnosed

4251
04:52:29,320 --> 04:52:35,040
and that's so that's so not that's so

4252
04:52:33,080 --> 04:52:37,558
different from the reality now where you

4253
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:40,558
can go into pretty much any doctor's

4254
04:52:37,558 --> 04:52:42,400
office and it's they will even tell you

4255
04:52:40,558 --> 04:52:45,080
you if you present with having fatigue

4256
04:52:42,400 --> 04:52:48,840
if you present with having brain fog

4257
04:52:45,080 --> 04:52:51,200
brain fog wasn't even a label for a

4258
04:52:48,840 --> 04:52:53,200
symptom before medical medium

4259
04:52:51,200 --> 04:52:55,798
information nobody knew what brain fog

4260
04:52:53,200 --> 04:52:58,120
was and there are so many people who

4261
04:52:55,798 --> 04:53:00,718
felt like there was something wrong with

4262
04:52:58,120 --> 04:53:02,638
them because when you don't have

4263
04:53:00,718 --> 04:53:03,840
information and there's something going

4264
04:53:02,638 --> 04:53:05,360
wrong in your body and you're

4265
04:53:03,840 --> 04:53:07,280
recognizing that you're having a

4266
04:53:05,360 --> 04:53:09,240
difficult time putting sentences

4267
04:53:07,280 --> 04:53:11,680
together you're having a difficult

4268
04:53:09,240 --> 04:53:13,680
time having having enough energy and

4269
04:53:11,680 --> 04:53:15,440
Clarity to get through the day and when

4270
04:53:13,680 --> 04:53:17,718
you're told oh you know your test

4271
04:53:15,440 --> 04:53:20,760
results show that everything looks

4272
04:53:17,718 --> 04:53:23,680
normal and and I can't find anything

4273
04:53:20,760 --> 04:53:24,920
wrong with you then of course it goes to

4274
04:53:23,680 --> 04:53:26,920
there's something wrong with me there's

4275
04:53:24,920 --> 04:53:29,878
something you know it's it's maybe it's

4276
04:53:26,920 --> 04:53:33,160
in my head that has changed that has

4277
04:53:29,878 --> 04:53:38,120
changed so significantly because of the

4278
04:53:33,160 --> 04:53:40,680
books and I feel very blessed to have

4279
04:53:38,120 --> 04:53:42,680
been fortunate enough to find the books

4280
04:53:40,680 --> 04:53:46,958
and to find the information pretty

4281
04:53:42,680 --> 04:53:50,080
shortly after the first one was released

4282
04:53:46,958 --> 04:53:52,600
and I mean after having those childhood

4283
04:53:50,080 --> 04:53:56,558
experiences of watching my family

4284
04:53:52,600 --> 04:53:59,520
members just suffer so much and not have

4285
04:53:56,558 --> 04:54:01,400
answers and be disrespected and and

4286
04:53:59,520 --> 04:54:04,798
confused you know and blaming themselves

4287
04:54:01,400 --> 04:54:06,600
as a result it just gave me this like

4288
04:54:04,798 --> 04:54:10,120
this fierceness to want to protect

4289
04:54:06,600 --> 04:54:12,718
people who who suffer and then I had my

4290
04:54:10,120 --> 04:54:14,760
own symptoms I had more minor symptoms

4291
04:54:12,718 --> 04:54:16,680
throughout my childhood I was always

4292
04:54:14,760 --> 04:54:19,480
sick I was always the one with a cold

4293
04:54:16,680 --> 04:54:22,878
sore when nobody else at my school had

4294
04:54:19,480 --> 04:54:26,280
cold sores or knew what cold sores were

4295
04:54:22,878 --> 04:54:27,440
you know and I almost didn't graduate

4296
04:54:26,280 --> 04:54:30,160
from high school because I missed so

4297
04:54:27,440 --> 04:54:32,958
many days of school due to being sick

4298
04:54:30,160 --> 04:54:35,320
and I had fatigue I had blood sugar

4299
04:54:32,958 --> 04:54:39,240
problems I had anxiety I had

4300
04:54:35,320 --> 04:54:42,360
depression and then when I got older

4301
04:54:39,240 --> 04:54:45,760
there was a time when I had a series of

4302
04:54:42,360 --> 04:54:46,958
really stressful events that thankfully

4303
04:54:45,760 --> 04:54:49,200
I learned from medical medium

4304
04:54:46,958 --> 04:54:50,920
information served as a trigger not a

4305
04:54:49,200 --> 04:54:52,600
cause because at the time I thought it

4306
04:54:50,920 --> 04:54:55,040
was a cause I thought I was creating my

4307
04:54:52,600 --> 04:54:57,360
own symptoms due to my stress and due to

4308
04:54:55,040 --> 04:54:59,958
the situations that I found myself in

4309
04:54:57,360 --> 04:55:03,120
that weren't within my control and

4310
04:54:59,958 --> 04:55:05,520
that's also something that it's really a

4311
04:55:03,120 --> 04:55:07,480
lot less commonplace now for people to

4312
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:10,040
think that way and feel that way because

4313
04:55:07,480 --> 04:55:12,160
of how much medical medium information

4314
04:55:10,040 --> 04:55:15,320
has gotten out there and because of how

4315
04:55:12,160 --> 04:55:19,638
much we have access to real answers now

4316
04:55:15,320 --> 04:55:21,798
and so when I first got really sick I

4317
04:55:19,638 --> 04:55:24,718
was in college I was planning on

4318
04:55:21,798 --> 04:55:28,000
becoming a naturopathic doctor and I was

4319
04:55:24,718 --> 04:55:29,638
a science girl I was so everything had

4320
04:55:28,000 --> 04:55:31,878
to be evidence-based I had been

4321
04:55:29,638 --> 04:55:34,200
plant-based I had been eating clean I

4322
04:55:31,878 --> 04:55:35,840
had been off of processed foods for

4323
04:55:34,200 --> 04:55:39,798
years and I thought I was taking really

4324
04:55:35,840 --> 04:55:43,040
good care of myself and then I you know

4325
04:55:39,798 --> 04:55:45,200
a series of stressful events can can

4326
04:55:43,040 --> 04:55:49,558
knock anybody down if you don't have

4327
04:55:45,200 --> 04:55:52,280
accurate information and so I got so

4328
04:55:49,558 --> 04:55:55,280
sick so quickly that I wasn't able to

4329
04:55:52,280 --> 04:55:58,160
work wasn't able to go to school I was

4330
04:55:55,280 --> 04:56:01,360
bedridden I was in this cycle of being

4331
04:55:58,160 --> 04:56:04,120
hospitalized every two weeks for months

4332
04:56:01,360 --> 04:56:06,400
and months and months and I was 21 years

4333
04:56:04,120 --> 04:56:09,280
old it was it was terrible and nobody

4334
04:56:06,400 --> 04:56:11,160
around me understood what was going on

4335
04:56:09,280 --> 04:56:13,718
and every time that I would go to the

4336
04:56:11,160 --> 04:56:16,400
hospital I would be told that my blood

4337
04:56:13,718 --> 04:56:20,160
work was fine as so many of you have had

4338
04:56:16,400 --> 04:56:22,480
similar experiences and I was told that

4339
04:56:20,160 --> 04:56:24,200
I was going to have to live with my

4340
04:56:22,480 --> 04:56:25,680
symptoms and conditions for the rest of

4341
04:56:24,200 --> 04:56:28,958
my life that the best thing that I was

4342
04:56:25,680 --> 04:56:31,400
going to be able to do would be to use

4343
04:56:28,958 --> 04:56:35,558
antibiotics and pain medications to

4344
04:56:31,400 --> 04:56:38,878
manage my symptoms forever and I had

4345
04:56:35,558 --> 04:56:41,160
Interstitial cystitis I had my fatigue

4346
04:56:38,878 --> 04:56:43,840
got really bad at that point I had a lot

4347
04:56:41,160 --> 04:56:46,798
of neurological symptoms I would get

4348
04:56:43,840 --> 04:56:50,320
heart palpitations and mystery fainting

4349
04:56:46,798 --> 04:56:53,638
spells and I had acne I had gained

4350
04:56:50,320 --> 04:56:55,760
weight even while I was I thought taking

4351
04:56:53,638 --> 04:56:57,840
such good care of myself and I was

4352
04:56:55,760 --> 04:57:01,638
somebody I learned through the

4353
04:56:57,840 --> 04:57:05,280
information that just needed to go a lot

4354
04:57:01,638 --> 04:57:09,240
further and I also learned from medical

4355
04:57:05,280 --> 04:57:11,600
medium information why it was that I got

4356
04:57:09,240 --> 04:57:13,638
to the point of being so sick even when

4357
04:57:11,600 --> 04:57:16,280
I was taking better care of myself than

4358
04:57:13,638 --> 04:57:19,400
anybody I knew it was because I

4359
04:57:16,280 --> 04:57:22,000
inherited pathogens talks cevy Metals I

4360
04:57:19,400 --> 04:57:24,798
inherited other exposures and then I was

4361
04:57:22,000 --> 04:57:27,480
also exposed to a lot throughout my life

4362
04:57:24,798 --> 04:57:30,600
and then the stress was a trigger and so

4363
04:57:27,480 --> 04:57:34,000
just having that information of it's not

4364
04:57:30,600 --> 04:57:37,080
my fault it's not it wasn't that I did

4365
04:57:34,000 --> 04:57:40,320
something wrong it was all these factors

4366
04:57:37,080 --> 04:57:42,480
that were out of my control and then

4367
04:57:40,320 --> 04:57:44,520
once you get empowered with the

4368
04:57:42,480 --> 04:57:47,878
information then you can do something

4369
04:57:44,520 --> 04:57:50,878
about it and so I'm very fortunate that

4370
04:57:47,878 --> 04:57:52,440
I you know my mom had gotten me the book

4371
04:57:50,878 --> 04:57:55,440
The First Medical medium book for

4372
04:57:52,440 --> 04:58:00,160
Christmas one year and because I was

4373
04:57:55,440 --> 04:58:05,240
such a science girl a Premed I at first

4374
04:58:00,160 --> 04:58:07,920
I scoffed at it and I was like medical

4375
04:58:05,240 --> 04:58:10,400
medium what is this guy going to tell me

4376
04:58:07,920 --> 04:58:14,558
about my health and you know what are

4377
04:58:10,400 --> 04:58:17,320
his credentials and I was that girl and

4378
04:58:14,558 --> 04:58:17,320
boy was I

4379
04:58:17,600 --> 04:58:22,718
humbled I shortly after is when I got

4380
04:58:20,558 --> 04:58:25,680
really sick and you know what when I was

4381
04:58:22,718 --> 04:58:27,798
bedridden and was seeing naturopaths I

4382
04:58:25,680 --> 04:58:30,840
was seeing every different type of

4383
04:58:27,798 --> 04:58:32,558
practitioner that was out there and

4384
04:58:30,840 --> 04:58:34,878
going on elimination diets doing

4385
04:58:32,558 --> 04:58:36,840
everything that I was told to do and

4386
04:58:34,878 --> 04:58:39,718
still not getting better and still not

4387
04:58:36,840 --> 04:58:42,798
being able to function I was like all

4388
04:58:39,718 --> 04:58:46,558
right what is this medical medium guy

4389
04:58:42,798 --> 04:58:49,400
GNA say and I cracked open the book gave

4390
04:58:46,558 --> 04:58:53,120
it a chance and within the first page I

4391
04:58:49,400 --> 04:58:53,120
was balling my eyes

4392
04:58:53,350 --> 04:58:58,000
[Applause]

4393
04:58:54,958 --> 04:59:01,718
out how many of you guys cried when you

4394
04:58:58,000 --> 04:59:03,520
first read the book yeah yeah you don't

4395
04:59:01,718 --> 04:59:04,920
get that right like where else where

4396
04:59:03,520 --> 04:59:06,798
else do you get that kind of experience

4397
04:59:04,920 --> 04:59:09,040
what other kind of book you know in the

4398
04:59:06,798 --> 04:59:10,520
health industry would you read and and

4399
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:13,280
so many people have just described

4400
04:59:10,520 --> 04:59:15,200
having a spiritual experience and just

4401
04:59:13,280 --> 04:59:17,600
getting emotional within even just the

4402
04:59:15,200 --> 04:59:20,440
first few pages you can just feel

4403
04:59:17,600 --> 04:59:22,558
there's so much and the living words and

4404
04:59:20,440 --> 04:59:25,798
the books and it just resonates as being

4405
04:59:22,558 --> 04:59:29,000
such truth that just doesn't Exist

4406
04:59:25,798 --> 04:59:32,558
Elsewhere and so I had that experience I

4407
04:59:29,000 --> 04:59:36,440
was humbled and I was blown away blown

4408
04:59:32,558 --> 04:59:38,160
away because I could not believe how

4409
04:59:36,440 --> 04:59:42,480
much that first

4410
04:59:38,160 --> 04:59:43,798
book it made so much logical sense

4411
04:59:42,480 --> 04:59:46,798
everything that's in there more than

4412
04:59:43,798 --> 04:59:48,240
anything I had studied in my premedical

4413
04:59:46,798 --> 04:59:50,718
program more than anything I had seen

4414
04:59:48,240 --> 04:59:53,760
out there in alternative medicine I

4415
04:59:50,718 --> 04:59:55,798
could see what I was missing and how I

4416
04:59:53,760 --> 04:59:57,000
had to take it further and then I

4417
04:59:55,798 --> 04:59:59,400
applied the

4418
04:59:57,000 --> 05:00:02,798
information and it took me some time you

4419
04:59:59,400 --> 05:00:06,040
know to get it right and then I within

4420
05:00:02,798 --> 05:00:08,878
six months healed over 30 symptoms and

4421
05:00:06,040 --> 05:00:10,040
conditions and lost over 30 lbs without

4422
05:00:08,878 --> 05:00:14,200
even trying

4423
05:00:10,040 --> 05:00:17,638
[Applause]

4424
05:00:14,200 --> 05:00:19,638
thank you guys and it changed my life

4425
05:00:17,638 --> 05:00:22,760

4426
05:00:19,638 --> 05:00:25,360
all these years help so many other

4427
05:00:22,760 --> 05:00:26,760

gotten to witness over the years and

4451
05:01:25,200 --> 05:01:35,878
when something is so pure so truthful so

4452
05:01:32,878 --> 05:01:39,400
powerful there are always going to be

4453
05:01:35,878 --> 05:01:41,878
forces that try to stand in the way of

4454
05:01:39,400 --> 05:01:46,040

05:11:20,320 --> 05:11:23,638
to get some cards and go hand them out

4574
05:11:22,000 --> 05:11:27,440
at the end of the line so if I disappear

4575
05:11:23,638 --> 05:11:30,958
that's where I'll be um yeah I I second

4576
05:11:27,440 --> 05:11:34,958
what Scott said it's just an honor

4577
05:11:30,958 --> 05:11:37,360
to um have like-minded people to discuss

4578
05:11:34,958 --> 05:11:41,440
all things mm because I'm sure you can

4579
05:11:37,360 --> 05:11:44,760
relate to talking to friends who aren't

4580
05:11:41,440 --> 05:11:47,200
mmm minded and it can be frustrating

4581
05:11:44,760 --> 05:11:50,920
sometimes

4582
05:11:47,200 --> 05:11:50,920
right where do you get your

4583
05:11:51,840 --> 05:11:54,840
protein

4584
05:11:56,000 --> 05:12:00,840
many the best cartoon I ever saw was a

4585
05:11:59,440 --> 05:12:03,680
um

4586
05:12:00,840 --> 05:12:07,040
T-Rex and wait is it a t no the long

4587
05:12:03,680 --> 05:12:10,760
neck what's that called long the long

4588
05:12:07,040 --> 05:12:12,600
neck yeah that and then the Velociraptor

4589
05:12:10,760 --> 05:12:15,240
behind it and the Velociraptor was

4590
05:12:12,600 --> 05:12:18,280
saying but where do you get your protein

4591
05:12:15,240 --> 05:12:21,360
and the long neck was going geez this

4592
05:12:18,280 --> 05:12:23,638
guy how we all feel those of us who are

4593
05:12:21,360 --> 05:12:26,040
plant-based um what do you guys want us

4594
05:12:23,638 --> 05:12:26,040
to talk

4595
05:12:27,638 --> 05:12:34,920
about um well the way we met Anthony was

4596
05:12:31,360 --> 05:12:36,840
through my my mom um and it was kind of

4597
05:12:34,920 --> 05:12:39,160
you know I think orchestrated in the

4598
05:12:36,840 --> 05:12:41,120
stars because uh my mom had a cont

4599
05:12:39,160 --> 05:12:43,000
contractor that was working for her um

4600
05:12:41,120 --> 05:12:46,200
doing some work at her house and I

4601
05:12:43,000 --> 05:12:48,878
didn't know him very well and he was

4602
05:12:46,200 --> 05:12:50,760
telling this story of his adoption which

4603
05:12:48,878 --> 05:12:53,558
was sort of a touching story and I was

4604
05:12:50,760 --> 05:12:55,600
you know listening and compassionate and

4605
05:12:53,558 --> 05:12:57,638
about two weeks after that he called me

4606
05:12:55,600 --> 05:13:01,040
and said

4607
05:12:57,638 --> 05:13:03,040
um hi it's Joe and I said hi and he said

4608
05:13:01,040 --> 05:13:04,280
I and I had noticed when he was telling

4609
05:13:03,040 --> 05:13:06,520
us the story

4610
05:13:04,280 --> 05:13:08,200
that he was coughing like that every

4611
05:13:06,520 --> 05:13:10,000
once in a while and he was a big

4612
05:13:08,200 --> 05:13:11,520
strapping

4613
05:13:10,000 --> 05:13:14,440
like that he would do that every you

4614
05:13:11,520 --> 05:13:17,400
know 30 seconds and he was very strong

4615
05:13:14,440 --> 05:13:19,120
strapping young guy and I at the time I

4616
05:13:17,400 --> 05:13:21,520
sort of unconsciously thought well

4617
05:13:19,120 --> 05:13:23,440
that's interesting he must be a smoker

4618
05:13:21,520 --> 05:13:26,878
and so he calls me like three weeks

4619
05:13:23,440 --> 05:13:29,558
after working for my mom and says um I

4620
05:13:26,878 --> 05:13:31,000
have some problems in my health and I

4621
05:13:29,558 --> 05:13:34,120
got this guy's

4622
05:13:31,000 --> 05:13:35,958
number and he's like he used the word

4623
05:13:34,120 --> 05:13:38,040
psychic he's like psychic he tells you

4624
05:13:35,958 --> 05:13:40,200
what's wrong with you do you think I

4625
05:13:38,040 --> 05:13:42,878
should call him first of all I'm like

4626
05:13:40,200 --> 05:13:47,520
why are you calling me I hardly know you

4627
05:13:42,878 --> 05:13:48,878
you know and but I said well Joe like he

4628
05:13:47,520 --> 05:13:51,840
goes do you believe in those things and

4629
05:13:48,878 --> 05:13:53,520
I said yeah I do absolutely and maybe

4630
05:13:51,840 --> 05:13:56,000
that's why he was calling me but I said

4631
05:13:53,520 --> 05:13:57,600
yes I do and I said what's the worst

4632
05:13:56,000 --> 05:14:00,680
that can happen once you start talking

4633
05:13:57,600 --> 05:14:02,320
to him you're going to know your your

4634
05:14:00,680 --> 05:14:04,040
cells in your body are going to tell you

4635
05:14:02,320 --> 05:14:05,638
this this feels right or this doesn't

4636
05:14:04,040 --> 05:14:07,240
just like when I read Anthony's first

4637
05:14:05,638 --> 05:14:11,240
book how many of you just your whole

4638
05:14:07,240 --> 05:14:13,240
body was going yes yes yes yes

4639
05:14:11,240 --> 05:14:15,120
right you're reading this you're like

4640
05:14:13,240 --> 05:14:16,878
this but this makes so much sense this

4641
05:14:15,120 --> 05:14:19,718
is so good okay so back to the story

4642
05:14:16,878 --> 05:14:21,600
with Joe so he says okay I'm going to

4643
05:14:19,718 --> 05:14:24,798
call him well that was Anthony that was

4644
05:14:21,600 --> 05:14:26,680
way back in 2009 or 10 when he was still

4645
05:14:24,798 --> 05:14:28,520
um doing

4646
05:14:26,680 --> 05:14:30,120
appointments and then I didn't hear from

4647
05:14:28,520 --> 05:14:31,558
him for a while and then he called me a

4648
05:14:30,120 --> 05:14:33,680
few weeks later and told me the whole

4649
05:14:31,558 --> 05:14:36,600
story which was Anthony said you have

4650
05:14:33,680 --> 05:14:39,240
this very unusual bacteria in your lung

4651
05:14:36,600 --> 05:14:41,200
it comes from and I don't remember the

4652
05:14:39,240 --> 05:14:43,798
exact River but it was like it comes

4653
05:14:41,200 --> 05:14:44,958
from the Black Snake River in Arkansas

4654
05:14:43,798 --> 05:14:46,680
let's say that's what it was but it

4655
05:14:44,958 --> 05:14:49,638
wasn't that I don't know what it was but

4656
05:14:46,680 --> 05:14:51,000
this was a long time ago and so Joe he

4657
05:14:49,638 --> 05:14:53,200
goes I don't know how you would have

4658
05:14:51,000 --> 05:14:56,040
gotten this Anthony says this to Joe and

4659
05:14:53,200 --> 05:14:57,718
Joe says well my partners parents live

4660
05:14:56,040 --> 05:14:59,320
on the Black Snake River in Arkansas and

4661
05:14:57,718 --> 05:15:02,120
I was there for a

4662
05:14:59,320 --> 05:15:04,718
month so he says okay why do I see

4663
05:15:02,120 --> 05:15:06,718
drywall and Joe said well I'm a

4664
05:15:04,718 --> 05:15:09,160
contractor um and he said okay the

4665
05:15:06,718 --> 05:15:11,120
drywall is not causing the problem but

4666
05:15:09,160 --> 05:15:13,718
not helping you get better can you

4667
05:15:11,120 --> 05:15:16,000
eliminate some of that so he said yes so

4668
05:15:13,718 --> 05:15:17,558
anyways Anthony said to him your doctors

4669
05:15:16,000 --> 05:15:19,000
are good doctors they're great but

4670
05:15:17,558 --> 05:15:20,400
they're going to misdiagnose this

4671
05:15:19,000 --> 05:15:22,558
they're going to misdiagnose it as

4672
05:15:20,400 --> 05:15:24,360
cancer and sure enough about a month

4673
05:15:22,558 --> 05:15:26,240
later Joe gets a call on a Friday night

4674
05:15:24,360 --> 05:15:28,120
from his doctor saying get your partner

4675
05:15:26,240 --> 05:15:29,840
come in here and get your things in

4676
05:15:28,120 --> 05:15:33,520
order

4677
05:15:29,840 --> 05:15:35,400
meaning you're done and of course Joe

4678
05:15:33,520 --> 05:15:37,760
freaked out called Anthony Anthony's

4679
05:15:35,400 --> 05:15:40,360
like you're fine they've just m

4680
05:15:37,760 --> 05:15:44,520
misdiagnosed us keep doing your protocol

4681
05:15:40,360 --> 05:15:48,400
and Joe is completely healthy and still

4682
05:15:44,520 --> 05:15:52,520
working and killing it so

4683
05:15:48,400 --> 05:15:55,680
yeah so how that connects to my mom is

4684
05:15:52,520 --> 05:15:58,638
my mom had a sciatic nerve pain for like

4685
05:15:55,680 --> 05:16:02,200
two years and she kept going to the her

4686
05:15:58,638 --> 05:16:03,840
doctors she was 86 or 84 at the time and

4687
05:16:02,200 --> 05:16:06,160
one doctor said to her oh Barbara this

4688
05:16:03,840 --> 05:16:07,280
is just this is what it is to be 80 for

4689
05:16:06,160 --> 05:16:10,958
and I was

4690
05:16:07,280 --> 05:16:13,200
like that no you shouldn't be in this

4691
05:16:10,958 --> 05:16:15,080
kind of pain and I kept begging her to

4692
05:16:13,200 --> 05:16:16,600
let me call Anthony and try to make an

4693
05:16:15,080 --> 05:16:19,360
appointment I didn't know him I just

4694
05:16:16,600 --> 05:16:20,840
heard through him through Joe and so

4695
05:16:19,360 --> 05:16:23,000
finally after three months of me

4696
05:16:20,840 --> 05:16:25,558
bothering my mom she said okay and we

4697
05:16:23,000 --> 05:16:27,840
called and Anthony immediately diagnosed

4698
05:16:25,558 --> 05:16:30,000
it as shingles a certain variety of

4699
05:16:27,840 --> 05:16:33,200
shingles that is not the kind where you

4700
05:16:30,000 --> 05:16:34,798
get the rash and we got the um

4701
05:16:33,200 --> 05:16:36,840
supplements for her and he recommended a

4702
05:16:34,798 --> 05:16:40,360
few dietary dietary

4703
05:16:36,840 --> 05:16:42,200
changes and within two days I called her

4704
05:16:40,360 --> 05:16:47,160
and I said hey Mom it's chelse and she

4705
05:16:42,200 --> 05:16:49,400
goes oh hi darling how are you and I was

4706
05:16:47,160 --> 05:16:52,120
so surprised because it was her voice

4707
05:16:49,400 --> 05:16:53,680
was back her real voice not the voice

4708
05:16:52,120 --> 05:16:56,120
that I'd heard for the last two years

4709
05:16:53,680 --> 05:16:58,878
that she had been in pain so she got

4710
05:16:56,120 --> 05:16:58,878
better and lived to be

4711
05:16:59,000 --> 05:17:04,320
95 passed away a few years

4712
05:17:01,718 --> 05:17:06,440
ago so you know we've been doing this

4713
05:17:04,320 --> 05:17:09,958
protocol for a long time as Scott said

4714
05:17:06,440 --> 05:17:12,000
and um we love it and I don't know I

4715
05:17:09,958 --> 05:17:13,798
maybe a few months ago I was having some

4716
05:17:12,000 --> 05:17:16,080
little tingling stuff down my leg and I

4717
05:17:13,798 --> 05:17:18,080
was doing the juicing and our whole

4718
05:17:16,080 --> 05:17:21,200
morning is like we have dueling juicers

4719
05:17:18,080 --> 05:17:23,920

4720
05:17:21,200 --> 05:17:27,320
youngest over there Owen does the whole

4721
05:17:23,920 --> 05:17:28,920
protocol o also so we're like excuse me

4722
05:17:27,320 --> 05:17:31,440

sink and do our cleaning of our celery

4724
05:17:31,440 --> 05:17:37,440
and all that and I was I was juicing and

4725
05:17:34,320 --> 05:17:39,280
I was kind of like H you know why am I

4726
05:17:37,440 --> 05:17:43,240
even doing this this isn't because I was

4727
05:17:39,280 --> 05:17:45,360
having some you know some symptoms and I

4728
05:17:43,240 --> 05:17:48,240
was feeling discouraged and then I

4729
05:17:45,360 --> 05:17:51,200
thought well what else am I going to do

4730
05:17:48,240 --> 05:17:53,760
I'm GNA like half a cup of coffee

4731
05:17:51,200 --> 05:17:58,760
no so I kept

4732
05:17:53,760 --> 05:18:00,958
juicing um it's the best as you know um

4733
05:17:58,760 --> 05:18:02,920
and we love Anthony he's incredibly

4734
05:18:00,958 --> 05:18:03,958
generous and compassionate as you know

4735
05:18:02,920 --> 05:18:06,600
sometimes I talk to him on the phone and

4736
05:18:03,958 --> 05:18:09,280
I'm like you are so patient how do you

4737
05:18:06,600 --> 05:18:11,360

05:18:09,280 --> 05:18:13,080
and anything else anything else you guys

4739
05:18:11,360 --> 05:18:15,958

good

4742
05:18:18,200 --> 05:18:25,840
how I guess maybe he has grown with his

4743
05:18:22,760 --> 05:18:28,000
patience over the years because his

4744
05:18:25,840 --> 05:18:32,320

4746
05:18:32,320 --> 05:18:35,480

doing the before the yeah the hey House

4750
05:18:39,920 --> 05:18:43,760
Radio Show before the podcast sometimes

4751
05:18:42,280 --> 05:18:45,680
when people would call in I would just

4752
05:18:43,760 --> 05:18:47,958
be

4753
05:18:45,680 --> 05:18:49,760
like and he's just saying oh well you

4754
05:18:47,958 --> 05:18:51,240
can try this and do that he was super

4755
05:18:49,760 --> 05:18:52,480
patient because people would ask about

4756
05:18:51,240 --> 05:18:54,080
things that had nothing to do with their

4757
05:18:52,480 --> 05:18:58,160
health and that's when I'm like oh my

4758
05:18:54,080 --> 05:19:01,000
goodness gracious no um I think that

4759
05:18:58,160 --> 05:19:03,200
he's just obviously very gifted you know

4760
05:19:01,000 --> 05:19:06,360
he's had this amazing gift given to him

4761
05:19:03,200 --> 05:19:08,680
from above and

4762
05:19:06,360 --> 05:19:11,440
um beautiful person and we feel

4763
05:19:08,680 --> 05:19:14,440
incredibly fortunate to call him our

4764
05:19:11,440 --> 05:19:14,440
friend

4765
05:19:16,200 --> 05:19:20,120
yeah just one I want to say one more

4766
05:19:18,760 --> 05:19:23,320
thing and then we're going to go do some

4767
05:19:20,120 --> 05:19:25,000
other stuff uh my wife says this all the

4768
05:19:23,320 --> 05:19:28,280
time to everybody because we get a lot

4769
05:19:25,000 --> 05:19:30,160
of phone calls all the time can you get

4770
05:19:28,280 --> 05:19:31,798
M information to Anthony can we ask

4771
05:19:30,160 --> 05:19:36,360
questions can we do that

4772
05:19:31,798 --> 05:19:38,360
and it really is in the books and if you

4773
05:19:36,360 --> 05:19:41,240
and if you if you haven't read them and

4774
05:19:38,360 --> 05:19:44,440
if you haven't explored them um the

4775
05:19:41,240 --> 05:19:46,120
reason he has stopped doing in person

4776
05:19:44,440 --> 05:19:49,080
and all of those things was so that he

4777
05:19:46,120 --> 05:19:52,400
could get the information in a book so

4778
05:19:49,080 --> 05:19:55,400
that it would be there for everybody to

4779
05:19:52,400 --> 05:19:58,040
take advantage of for years to come and

4780
05:19:55,400 --> 05:19:59,680
that's a that's the biggest gift uh I I

4781
05:19:58,040 --> 05:20:02,000
I I don't think people will understand

4782
05:19:59,680 --> 05:20:03,400
that because we T we take for granted

4783
05:20:02,000 --> 05:20:04,920
Anthony's here we can you know he's

4784
05:20:03,400 --> 05:20:06,160
going to keep doing his thing and we're

4785
05:20:04,920 --> 05:20:09,200
going to keep getting question we can go

4786
05:20:06,160 --> 05:20:12,680
and watch him online and da d da but

4787
05:20:09,200 --> 05:20:14,680
it the books are invaluable and um I

4788
05:20:12,680 --> 05:20:16,760
encourage everybody to spread them

4789
05:20:14,680 --> 05:20:21,000
around and read them if you get a chance

4790
05:20:16,760 --> 05:20:23,400
the Brain book is insane there's I just

4791
05:20:21,000 --> 05:20:25,160
kept saying I can't I don't no I don't

4792
05:20:23,400 --> 05:20:28,200
believe that I can't believe that that's

4793
05:20:25,160 --> 05:20:30,798
amazing where did that come from um that

4794
05:20:28,200 --> 05:20:33,040
