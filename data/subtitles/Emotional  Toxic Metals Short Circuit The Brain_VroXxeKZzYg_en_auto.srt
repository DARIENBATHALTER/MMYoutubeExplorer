1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
day three heavy metal detox cleanse

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,600
challenge

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,680
this is a special time because when you

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,120
get rid of metals

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,240
you become lighter i think people

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,440
overall want to feel as if they're

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
lightened up like the load is taken off

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,320
them

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
loads not on their back they don't feel

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
a load on their

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,160
chest lightening the load that's what

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,680
happens when you get rid of toxic heavy

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
metals

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
because stress even reduces when you get

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,719
rid of toxic heavy metals

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
the more metal that leaves your brain

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,559
the less stress

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,920
you feel even when you're under stress

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
even when you're under stressful

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,000
situations

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,039
you actually feel lighter less

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,520
disgruntled

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:57,360
less flustered less miserable

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,760
less depressed less anxiety ridden

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,280
when you don't have an anxiety problem

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,560
anymore because you got the metals out

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,960
and they're gone things lighten up

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
you know you don't react so much you

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,400
don't get triggered so easy

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,240
metals are why you get triggered

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,240
that's one of the big ways we get

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,360
triggered it's metals

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
it's not you it's not because you're

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
someone that gets triggered

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
it's not because you're a difficult

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
person

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,560
and you know and and that's it

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,479
facebook's not working i hear so

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,399
it's like it's it's more than that

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,840
it's more than that it's not about

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,240
you being somebody that is just messed

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
up

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,880
that person's messed up no no person's

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,680
not messed up

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
medals do all kinds of stuff they make

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,759
it so we get triggered they make it so

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
we get emotional

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,280
metals can get us amped up metals can

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,719
take us to a place where we get

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
emotional easy

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,000
we get very emotional easy and then

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
metals can do even more

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
than that metals can take us to a place

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,480
of mania

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,879
like hysteria neurosis psychosis it

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,080
could take you even to that degree

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:27,280
metals can give you an eating disorder

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
do you know that metals cause bulimia

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,920
metals cause anorexia

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
metals cause all kinds of eating

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,360
disorders

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
metals cause all kinds of emotional

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
disorders

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,200
constant mental disorders metals

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
really do a lot of damage and think

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
about that

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
think about that think about somebody

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
with an eating disorder severe eating

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
disorder

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,200
one that's shaped their life for

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
difficult situations with their family

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
difficult situations with everybody that

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
loves them different difficult

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,319
situations with

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,840
with it with anybody around them

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,400
even like be feeling like they're

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
tortured and torturing others that kind

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
of feeling and

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,440
and meanwhile it's metals

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,560
short-circuiting the brain

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,800
and sending signals down the highway

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
the neurological highway you guys the

83
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
vagus nerve

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,159
sending signals to the vagus nerve

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,200
metals can send

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,319
signals down the vagus nerve boom and

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,159
get down to the gut right here

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,599
and create an eating disorder right

89
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,840
there metals

90
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,920
can set those signals down because

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,159
there's a short circuit happening up

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
here

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,799
i'm like up to here with neuroscience

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,840
talk

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,239
so many geniuses

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:56,000
so many geniuses in alternative health

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,920
i'm up to here with so much of that

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
so much i'm up to here with the whole

99
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,640
thing about you created your problems

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,280
like you created your problems

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
you did you just couldn't master your

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
thoughts right you couldn't mask i'm so

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
up to here about that

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
there's real reasons why people are

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
struggling and are struggling with their

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
thoughts and they're struggling with

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
their actions and they're struggling

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
with their pain and suffering

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,600
and their emotions and their anxiety and

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
their depression their personalization

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,240
their bipolar and everything else

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
there's real reasons medals are the big

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
reason

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,600
the big reason up to here

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
with oh it's because you can't master

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
your thoughts yeah we want to

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,400
we definitely want to think positive and

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,080
we definitely want to fight

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
we definitely want to fight for it and

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,520
we definitely want to better ourselves

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
emotionally we definitely want to better

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
ourselves with everything we can with

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
our meditations and everything else

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,880
absolutely we want to do those things we

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,880
need to be in the positive absolutely

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
but we can't beat the piss out of

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,840
ourselves

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
when we're struggling with anxiety and

129
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
that depression and everything else and

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
we can't

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
believe that we manifested our problems

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
and our emotional problems that we

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
manifested that because it's metals that

134
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
are speaking for you

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,160
not you not you being a bad person not

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
you causing the harm or causing the

137
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
trouble

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,320
it's metals that are speaking for you

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
and when we get those metals out and

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
they come out

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,160
then the wires work differently the

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,199
wires work like they should

143
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,560
we come into this world as a baby

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
saturated in metal we come into this

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
world

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,759
and then we get the medical crap going

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,680
on a medical system

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,240
boom as a baby saturating us with metals

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,400
right off the running that's what the

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
medical system does

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,560
that's right it hits you with metals

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,919
right off the running

153
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,440
and then you're doing the medications

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,479

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,039
amazing amazing

194
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,440
metal short circuit our brains that's

195
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,240
what

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,919
metals do short circular brain so we get

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
triggered real easy

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,199
real easy and when we're young we get

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,840
triggered real easy

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
now we're crying in the corner when

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
we're kind of not supposed to or we're

202
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,599
in the store we get a blood sugar crash

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
and we're in the store as a child and we

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,160
get a blood sugar crash now we're

205
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,039
screaming and crying in the aisle

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,039
because metals what they do is they make

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
it so that when you get that blood sugar

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
crash

209
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,160
they get they make it so you can trigger

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,840
it easy

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
trigger it easy and then the focus and

212
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,520
concentration

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,960
focus and concentration that all the

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,280
children are going through that's metals

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,720
all of that focus and concentration

216
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,000
adults go through that's all metals too

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,120

far off the mark

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,960
but that's how it's supposed to be it's

supposed to be

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,240
it's supposed to be far off the mark

230
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,760
your professors in your universities

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
they're not supposed to know that you

232
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,440
guys you know that you guys went to

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,959
college

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,240
we went to university and went to dorm

235
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,440
rooms that the rooms were saturated

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,120
every single time you go away

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,399
you go away in december they sat they

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
spray the rooms

239
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,160
before you go in in the fall they spray

240
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
all the rooms

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,320
all the rooms and they spray it with

242
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
rodent killer

243
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
they spray it with roach killer they

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,120
spray it with insect killer

245
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
a worm killer whatever they can get and

246
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
they spray and they saturate the rooms

247
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
and then the kids

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
they just go to college breathe it all

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
in and then the weight gain hits it's

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
not just the food

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
if the weight gain hits and everybody's

252
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,839
battling their weight in college

253
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
it's like well i must be oh honey you

254
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,959
put on a lot of weight since the last

255
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,760
semester over and over again all that

256
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,040
pesticide

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
all those metals in the system

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
meanwhile you know what did the

259
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,440
professors know

260
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,839
i don't know anything about metals

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,680
this is the way it works karen says what

262
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,040
heavy metal causes dyslexia mercury

263
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,120
mercury mercury mercury the metals are

264
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
everywhere right we can't avoid them

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,760
they're everywhere

266
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,360
you know they're in the tattoo ink every

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,800
single person who has a tattoo

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
has metals leaching into their

269
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,680
bloodstream

270
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,560
every single vegan non-toxic so-called

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
ink that's used now saturated metals

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
because that's

273
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,120
that's the pop the light hits the

274
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,440
ink through the skin if they don't put

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
metal in it there won't be a reflection

276
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
and you won't get a pop from the ink

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,160
they're loaded with metal

278
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,720
doesn't matter how good or high gray

279
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,399
that

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,399
ink is how you know animal cruelty free

281
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,120
that ink is is the best vegan

282
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,680
animal cruelty free no it's loaded with

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
metals

284
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
so now we've got metals leaching in us

285
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
our whole life

286
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
our whole life and those metals leave

287
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
the ink and they blew they leave the

288
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,480
derma they go into the bloodstream and

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
it's a time release

290
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,839
release capsule capsules like taking a

291
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,000
time release capsule of metal

292
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
so we can run and we can run and we can

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
run but we can't hide

294
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,880
because metals are all around us so then

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
it makes the load heavy and it starts to

296
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,399
short-circuit the brain

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,760
and then you get older and that's it why

298
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
is alzheimer's on the

299
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,079
on the high why is it going up and up

300
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,399
and up and memory problems and

301
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
dementia and not even just that focused

302
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,279
concentration and brain fog and

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,000
everything under the sun depression and

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
anxiety

305
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,760
it's it's going up and up and up and up

306
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
in bipolar bipolar bipolar

307
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
it's because the metals the metals in

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
the brain they short get short-circuit

309
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,120
the brain

310
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,320
they get a short-circuited so

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,399
the heavy metal detox cleanse it's like

312
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,640
where it's really at

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,880
that's where it's really at really at

314
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
meanwhile all the other bs going around

315
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,120
and all turned medicines

316
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,040
it's a joke compared joke it's so sad

317
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
danielle the only info that has helped

318
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200

i am you know what's annoying i see

328
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,240
lately

329
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
people dabbling with the medical meme

330
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,959
information not citing it right

331
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,880
i know i said that but then adding like

332
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,160
the coffee enema thing

333
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,000
right if oh man also do your coffee

334
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,240

also do do your coffee enemas do your

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
bentonite clay

337
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
do your green tea and they just screw it

338
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,920
all

339
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,519
up and so people get a tidbit of that

340
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,440
medical medium but they can't really

341
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,519
heal if they're really sick

342
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,680
samantha says do you have any insight on

343
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
fulvic minerals of course i do

344
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
they're that that products useless to

345
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
waste money it's throwing money away

346
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,839
it's throwing money away i would spend

347
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,519
my money on those wild blueberries right

348
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,880
there right there

349
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,519
take that money for that that

350
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,639
that crappy product and you go and buy

351
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
some wild blueberries

352
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
take that money and you make sure you

353
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,160
buy extra celery

354
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,160
extra celery with that money each month

355
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
that's what you do that's what i

356
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,279
recommend

357
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
they won't remove toxic heavy metals

358
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
number one okay

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
you can get more minerals the body will

360
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,040
receive and enjoy

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
through that celery right there that's

362
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,920
that's right that

363
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,440
vulva fulvic acids been around fulvic

364
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
minerals have been around

365
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959
been around it's just it died it died

366
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
they're just trying to amp it up now

367
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
they're trying to ride the medical

368
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
medium train

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,959
that's what they're doing but the whole

370
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
fulvic product thing just

371
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,800
went down the hill back 15 years ago but

372
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,720
there's a new generation of suckers

373
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,480
that i'm just giving you like it is what

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600

i would i would thank you for asking no

377
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
it's important question because it might

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,199
have saved somebody some money in the

379
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,199
future

380
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:04,320
so yeah metals can cause schizophrenia

381
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,120
absolutely i saw that question 100

382
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
100 so getting the metals out of

383
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
critical so we're on day three the heavy

384
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,519
metal

385
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
cleanse right heavy metal detox cleanse

386
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,800
challenge

387
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,839
and getting battles out of your life is

388
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,959
like

389
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,760
that's where it's at that's where it's

390
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,600
at

391
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
but here's the problem you can't see the

392
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
metals so

393
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
are they really there you can't see the

394
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,360
metals

395
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,000
so is it really something i should do

396
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
and science research doesn't know what

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
connects to anxiety and depression and

398
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,880
depersonalization and neuroscientists

399
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,480
in neuro talking about neural pathways

400
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,480
don't even know about what causes

401
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,560
anxiety depression and depersonalization

402
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,360
focus concentration adhd alzheimer's and

403
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,240
they don't know so they're not saying

404
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,480
metals is unless they got it from mm

405
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,160
but they're not saying that also metals

406
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,880
aren't really there so i guess i don't

407
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,480
need to worry about them

408
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,639
right biofeedback is where it's at

409
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,360
oh nice try nice try watch

410
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,760
biofeedback people pour into my office

411
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
after

412
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
doing biofeedback and sure

413
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,560
you know you know what will make

414
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
biofeedback work is if someone's doing

415
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,680
their celery juice

416
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
doing their heavy metal detox smoothies

417
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,959
doing their medical meaning protocols

418
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
healing themselves and then getting

419
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
biofeedback and then you just say it was

420
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
the biofeedback that did it

421
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
because before medical medium everybody

422
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,920
was doing medical medium biofeedback

423
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,120
just left everybody sick

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,600
it's amazing what happens if and look

425
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,880
no disrespect to biofeedback

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,160
practitioners

427
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,440
no disrespect it's just that

428
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,839
if you don't say it like it is you can't

429
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
save

430
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,880

really sick

442
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,519
like through them it doesn't matter

443
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,600
because even though i know

444

so don't step on any toes

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,120
and then and then it's make or break you

448
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
know what it is it's break

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,720
that means somebody goes down when

450
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,360
they're really sick

451
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
really sick i've seen biofeedback take

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
them down

453
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,360
when they're really sick

454
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,000
i've seen rife machines

455
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
aggravate the heck out of someone's

456
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,880
nervous system

457
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,880
when they're that low and going down

458
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,519
all those things are for people who

459
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
aren't sick enough yet to know how bad

460
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
they are

461
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
all those things are people for you know

462
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,759
fulvic acid

463
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,360
fovic mineral supplements are for people

464
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,040
who aren't sick enough yet

465
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
to know what it's to to know what it's

466
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,759
like to be on the edge and then you do

467
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,520
one wrong move and then you're down

468
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
one wrong move and then you're screwed

469
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
and then you're down that's

470
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,400
that's what that stuff's for coffee

471
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,120
enemas are for people who don't know

472
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,039
what it's like

473
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,720
to be on that edge when people are

474
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,360
really sick that's when you can tell the

475
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
story

476
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
that's when you know what works or

477
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
doesn't work when people are on the edge

478
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
and all of a sudden they get the coffee

479
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
enema and boom it takes them down and

480
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
guess what no one hears about it

481
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
no one hears about it oh okay no one

482
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,039
knows what took that person down

483
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,440
that person's gone see you later just

484
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,559
forget about that person

485
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,679
that's how it works so it's just unless

486
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,720
when you're on that

487
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
that life or death you're really sick

488
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,840
and you start doing all the wrong stuff

489
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
oh you go down

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
quick but when you're not so sick or not

491
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
sick at all you can do give me another

492
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
coffee enema

493
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,799
and i'll even drink some coffee too give

494
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720

some bio feedback as well

499
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,039
because i'm not sick enough yet to know

500
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
that that's not good not going to really

501
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,200
help

502
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,080
but when you're sick and you're on that

503
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,720
edge that's when your man or mouse

504
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
the stuff you're using is man or mouse

505
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,679
that's when the stuff you're using is

506
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
make or break

507
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
that's what it matters that's when oh my

508
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,799
god

509
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,480
when you're somebody really struggling

510
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,080
you got the mecfs

511
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,080
you already had too much blood taken

512
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,760
from you you've been to the lyme doctor

513
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
other doctors the other doctors and then

514
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
you do the wrong things and you go

515
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
downhill while your family's watching

516
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
you go downhill and you're going down

517
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,440
down down down

518
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,760
and one more coffee enema and you're

519
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
like done

520
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,960
a little bentonite clay diatomaceous

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
earth particles

522
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
a little zeolite a little whatever that

523
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,720
doesn't help you and you're down

524
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,960
down but when you're not sick you can

525
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,200
play in that game world

526
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
you got a little acne maybe your energy

527
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
is not that strong you're seeing

528
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
all your functional medicine doctors

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
okay i'll try coffee enema

530
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,400
okay you know i'll try this okay i'll

531
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,960
try that no i'm kind of okay not so bad

532
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
i'm trying to figure it out

533
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
if you're not if you're there you can

534
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
play in the game of that i'll still do

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
my green tea

536
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
i'll do my kombucha tea which turns your

537
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,120
blood into straight acid

538
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,440
i'll do my kombucha tea i can get away

539
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,440
with it i'm really not sick

540
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,679
i'm really not sick but i know i'm not

541
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
right but i'm really not sick i can do a

542
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
little list and i can do a little that

543
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
but man when you're sick you do that

544
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,520
baking soda you dump all that

545
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,679
sodium bicarbonate inside of you and you

546
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,799
have some some bentonite clay

547
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
and you dump some caffeine in you and

548
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,559
you go

549
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,480
down boom and you go down

550
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,480
and that's the difference

551
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
and you dump a whole bunch of oil in you

552
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
let me do that cleanse that's a whole

553
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
bunch of olive oil

554
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,160
let me do that and then you go down let

555
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,320
me do a whole sodium bicarbonate

556
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
thing now let me try that let me try a

557
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,160
bunch of neem oil and then do let me put

558
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,080
a whole bunch of essential oils

559
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,240
in and it actually ingests it

560
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,760
let me do oh i have an essential oil

561
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
person coming and they told me i can

562
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,120
swallow this

563
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
swallow this essential oil because it'll

564
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159

565
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,159
and you're just gone because when you're

566
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,840
on the edge all it takes

567
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,400
is the stupid things yeah and it'll take

568
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,440
you out

569
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
what's wrong with bentonite clay tears

570
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
the crap and destroys the crap out of

571
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,919
your intestinal tract

572
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,520
it does rips it to shreds and scars it

573
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,640
not supposed to be consumed

574
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,159
exactly and zeolites

575
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,080
zeolites are bad because what's happened

576
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
is they unearth

577
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
the dangerous zeolites the the unedible

578
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,080
ones

579
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,919
and they're manufactured in the same

580
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,960
facilities they've been dusted

581
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,240
okay it wasn't like that years ago

582
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,440
but it's like that now so

583
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,840
you're not doing well all it takes is

584
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,000
a bad zeolite situation you're down i

585
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,240
don't care what company it is

586
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,520
because they're cross-contaminated now

587
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,520
they're cross-contaminated

588
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,120
but who cares

589
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,760
who cares if somebody goes down

590
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
like zeolite never even removes any

591
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,799
metals from the brain

592
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,760
or liver anyway

593
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,480
but who cares if somebody goes down see

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
thing i've ever seen out there

i bet you you forgot definitely so we're

651
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
talking about

652
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,960
the whole thing with depersonalization

653
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,559
by the way guys this toxic heavy metals

654
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,679
depersonalization

655
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,279
the personal toxic heavy metals

656
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,320
okay live in us rent free in our brain

657
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,600
courtesy of the industries

658
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,720
right the industries need us sheeple

659
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,320
they need us dumbed down metals are

660
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,080
ignored

661
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,600
by all the industries especially big

662
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
pharma because big pharma has all the

663
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,279
metals

664
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,000
in the pharmaceuticals it's

665
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
a way and technique to dumb people down

666
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,840
metals

667
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,720
aren't in pharmaceuticals by the way to

668
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
help us they don't have to be in a

669
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,880
pharmaceutical

670
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,000
they're in pharmaceuticals to hurt us

671
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,039
to keep us sheeple and dumb down there's

672
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,400
a bigger mission up there in the sky i'm

673
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,760
not talking about the doctors not

674
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
talking about the doctors that

675
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,960
go to medical school and don't know

676
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,880
what's happening and they just

677
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,000
they just they're there to help you

678
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
they're there to help you

679
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
they're there to put your bones back

680
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,279
together after bad car crash

681
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
they're they're they're there to help

682
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,799
you because we were taught to eat

683
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
wrong and we were taught to take care of

684
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,880
ourselves wrong so all of a sudden when

685
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,760
an organ that can be replaced by science

686
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,919
and research

687
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,120
that did a great job with our surgeons

688
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,960
and teaching our surgeons and our

689
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,080
surgeons learning along the way right

690
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,760
we can get something done we can get a

691
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,360
life-saving surgical technique

692
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,840
absolutely i know surgeons

693
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,679
and yeah definitely

694
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,159
right but they're trained in a system

695
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
that has

696
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,799
its limits so chronic illness is growing

697
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,279
exponentially

698
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,039
and it's a sick system and people are

699
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,880
getting sicker and sicker and sicker and

700
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,520
no one's trained in all that

701
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
so really we're all stuck we're stuck

702
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
there

703
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,240
and but oh don't worry we can rely on

704
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,320
all of our functional medicine doctors

705
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,919
and alternative medicine or for sure

706
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
we're gonna they're just gonna they'll

707
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,240
take more blood and more blood and more

708
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,600
blood and they'll bleed us to death

709
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,640
so we lose our immune systems

710
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,600
the system is is rigged

711
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,919
doctors are trained to keep you sick too

712
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
they

713
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,960
pull all that blood out of you pull all

714
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,279
that blood out of you

715
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
and then if you get a smart doctor an

716
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,080
alternative

717
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,640
you know movement they'll they'll put

718
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,720
you on a coffee animal routine

719
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
which is disastrous maybe they'll

720
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
recommend some diatomaceous earth some

721
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
bentonite clay

722
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
some fish oil right and some other

723
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
things too

724
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,720
taboo along with your vitamin d which is

725
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
good for you

726
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,559
along with your curcumin which is good

727
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
for you

728
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,840
and maybe they'll tell you to do some

729
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,480
celery and sorry juice to be keeping you

730
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,159
together

731
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
while there's all this bad stuff you're

732
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
being told to do and nobody will know

733
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
it's a celery juice keeping

734
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,240
keeping your ass together while all the

735
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,840
bad stuff is trying to take you down

736
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,840
and then when you do go down just blame

737
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840

extremely alkaline that's one reason

767
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
another reason calcium that's

768
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,360
bioavailable

769
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,960

777
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,600
then

778
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:01,039
it's when it's in its raw state raw

779
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,559

of the day or any time you want right

788
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,399

790
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,679

limes

793
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,320
now this is just to say you could be

794
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,159
your own detective

795
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,440
okay so a friend of mine said that one

796
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,720
time and

797
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,720
i asked my friend i said well what

798
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,880
happens when you

799
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,240
have lemon somehow do you like fresh

800
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,520
from a lemon like this a little water do

801
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
you swell up

802
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,200
does your throat close you can't breathe

803
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,200
do you need an epipen

804
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,799
do you get rushed to the hospital does

805
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,000
something funny happen

806
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,480
in your mouth you know what what happens

807
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,720
my friend was like no no i go because

808
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
that's an allergic reaction

809
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
and my friend was like no no i went to a

810
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
doctor they did food out food

811
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,279
sensitivity tests it was on the list

812
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,520
with 50 other things

813
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,039
i said well then you're not allergic

814
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,679
because those things are inaccurate and

815
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,600
they don't work

816
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,120
those tests don't work but if you're

817
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,559
having a reaction

818
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,799
then yeah you're allergic if you're

819
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,279
having a reaction so i always tell

820
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
people

821
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,679
be your own detective if you're having a

822
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,679
reaction you're allergic

823
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,159
but i told my friend if it was because

824
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,760
it was on a food sensitivity test

825
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,799
you're not allergic

826
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,799
lemon cleans out the bugs

827
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,720
cleans out the garbage but what the good

828
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,960
point the whole

829
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,840
the whole thing too if you get hives

830
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,039
from something you're doing that's

831
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,799
healthy

832
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,480
you're flushing the liver so if you're

833
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,960
doing if you get a hive because you

834
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,039
drink

835
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,200
lemon water oh you just flush that liver

836
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,039
of a lot of poison so it takes time

837
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,240
you do smaller dosages of things and

838
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,880
then the next thing you know you don't

839
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,480
get hives anymore and you flush out all

840
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,600
that poison flesh out all that stuff

841
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,840
that's something to think about too

842
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,880
meera says my son is allergic to cats

843
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,279
and dust mites i believe it

844
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,559
would i would i always recommend ask

845
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,799
your doctor what's right for you but i

846
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,200
always recommend when you start cleaning

847
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,039

and you clean that out at least you

852

start with that

853
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,799
what happens is all of a sudden the

854
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,200
animal allergies start to disappear

855
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,799
and the dust mite allergies start to

856
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,480
disappear

came about

868
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,080

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,200
know why anybody's sick they don't know

886
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,640

about metals now from

890
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,120
all the years and all the medical medium

891
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
books have gone around teaching people

892
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,559
about metals but

893
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,000
but they don't really know that it was

894
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
built on a system where we don't know

895
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
why anybody's sick so let's just try

896
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
this

897
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,279
it's like okay that's why they'll say

898
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,159

gene my skin tests for allergies

904
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,480
are accurate skin tests

905
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,600
so the other thing too is skin problems

906
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,200

907
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600

okay

911
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,799
allergies develop because of a toxic

912
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,240
stagnant sluggish liver

913
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,880
stagnant sluggish liver that's toxic

914
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,360
a liver filled with strep a liver filled

915
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
with

916
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,559
ebv a liver filled with all kinds of

917
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,399
metals the liver filled the pesticides

918
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,919
herbicides fungicides petrochemicals

919
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,600
liver filled the plastics liver filled

920
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,799
with all kinds of different toxic

921
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
chemicals

922
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,240
fragrances fill up in the liver lots of

923
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
fragrances when that liver just starts

924
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
to get overloaded overloaded man

925
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,200
you'll get all kinds of allergies and

926
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,640
they'll play they'll be playing allergy

927
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,799
games on skin tests

928
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,320
blood tests to the cows come home you'd

929
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,919

my allergy shots for that

932
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,120
meanwhile until that liver gets cleaned

933
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,000
up and things start getting out of your

934
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,600
system

935
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,080
and you start getting rid of some foods

936
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,840
that contribute to that whole

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,240
to be able to flush whatever is coming

958
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,480

967
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,320
the lemon water is hydrating on a level

968
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,599

lemons the lemon tree has adapted

1007
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,079

another

1078
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:52,400
snare it's a new technique

1079
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,040
to pasteurize drinks that's

1080
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,320
foreign to the cells of whatever plant

1081
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,760
food that's being

1082
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,880
you know consumed or juiced

1083
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,480
they're hp peeing celery and you buy it

1084
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,960
on the shelf you think it's fresh you

1085
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,200
think it's raw

1086
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,960
but there's a date on that drink you're

1087
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,800
drinking and the date is like

1088
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,800
two weeks from now and how's that

1089
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,560
possible if it's freshly done

1090
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,240
i'll tell you how it's possible it's

1091
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,160
been pasteurized it's called hpp

1092
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,599

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
you can then work on your celery juice

1123
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,119
and listen you can drag this out

1124
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,040
throughout the morning if you need to

1125
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,480
drag it out

1126
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,480
and then we wait a little while we do

1127
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
the heavy metal detox smoothie coming up

1128
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
so we'll get that done but we go

1129
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,560
before we do the heavy metal detox movie

1130
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,079
we'll talk a little bit about what's

1131
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,200
happening in our brains

1132
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,640
let's get a brain out

1133
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,400
the thing is with fluoride treatments

1134
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
i've talked about this before um

1135
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,240
uh susan elizabeth it's amazing how you

1136
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,880
always get 16 ounces

1137
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,040
no no 32 ounces

1138
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
[Laughter]

1139
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,000
32 ounces not 16 ounces

1140
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,079
32 ounces i mean 16 ounces is okay

1141
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,680
you can do 16 ounces if you'd like don't

1142
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,160
worry i mean you can i'm not saying you

1143
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,440
have to do 32 ounces right

1144
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,359
so this is important to know fluoride

1145
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,119
treatments are a direct main line to the

1146
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,960
brain

1147
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,720
that's aluminum byproducts a lot of

1148
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,000
people have aluminum byproduct built up

1149
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,040
in their brain

1150
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,599
a lot of it a lot of it

1151
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,720
so what happens is that those fluoride

1152
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,079
treatments

1153
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,920
direct to the brain direct

1154
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,359
if you're somebody with who's sensitive

1155
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
has a neurological condition and you're

1156
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,040
sensitive or so forth

1157
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,839
right and you get a fluoride treatment

1158
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,920
it can keep you in bed for weeks that's

1159
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,040
when you feel it when you're really on

1160
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,319
the edge

1161
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,520
so i'd say keep those fluoride

1162
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,319
treatments away if you had fluoride

1163
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,520
treatments in the past

1164
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,880
it's not the past it's in the present

1165
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,280
that fluoride's still in your brain

1166
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,040
stuck in the present moment right now

1167
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,800
so it's important how metals work they

1168
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,520
actually sit and then

1169
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,839
sit in us for years and years to come

1170
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,319
and here's the problem with metals

1171
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,680
right we end up going on our high fat

1172
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,319
high fat diets

1173
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,200
and our high fat diets oxidize the metal

1174
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,920
quicker

1175
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,280
this accelerates all of our diseases

1176
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,000
that have everything to do with the

1177
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,960
brain

1178
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,800
it's the high fat diet right i'm not

1179
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,920
sitting here scolding anybody

1180
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,319
about you know almonds today or walnuts

1181
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,480
or

1182
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,520
hemp seeds or sunflower seeds healthy

1183
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,359
fats right avocado healthy fat

1184
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,319
if you're gonna eat fat those are the

1185
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,079
fats to eat right hemp seeds and avocado

1186
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,760
those are the fat those are the healthy

1187
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,880
fats to eat

1188
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,400
some walnuts right sunflower seeds yeah

1189
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,640
sesame tahini

1190
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,359
right those are those are the healthy

1191
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,440
fats if you're going to eat fats right

1192
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,359
but even then though if you want to heal

1193
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,200
if you really want to heal and you want

1194
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,000
to heal quicker you've got to be careful

1195
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,839
on how many

1196
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
healthy fats you eat you don't want the

1197
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,400
bad fats ever

1198
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,400
but you've got to be careful on how many

1199
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,440
healthy fats you eat

1200
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,400
because the fats accelerate

1201
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:43,440
the metal fatty acid

1202
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,720
fats are really acidic including chicken

1203
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,280
turkey meat fish

1204
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,640
those fats are really acidic too really

1205
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,839
acidic

1206
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,079
and what it does it accelerates the

1207
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,400
metal

1208
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,359
byproduct that's produced from the metal

1209
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,440
oxidizing

1210
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,200
so all these speckles of metal from your

1211
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,480
fluoride treatments and the pesticides

1212
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
you breathe in and

1213
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,440
everything else that you've ever had

1214
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,079
from the chemtrails coming out of the

1215
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,480
sky

1216
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,520
to the air fresheners and perfumes

1217
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,599
colognes to the

1218
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,280
cleaning products to the medical

1219
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,040
treatments to everything that you've had

1220
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,920
in your life that built up metals to sit

1221
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,680
inside your brain

1222
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,920
to give you anxiety depression

1223
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,960
depersonalization

1224
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,240
focus and concentration issues adhd

1225
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,200
right autism okay memory loss dementia

1226
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,319
alzheimer's parkinson's wilson's disease

1227
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,319
right

1228
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,440
and even even without all that let's

1229
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,720
just say just

1230
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,680
emotionally triggered really easy right

1231
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,359
emotionally triggered all of that medals

1232
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,240
eating disorders bulimia

1233
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,280
anorexia other eating disorders that

1234
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,319
aren't as severe

1235
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,880
and still severe okay

1236
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,000
that's the metals and then all the fats

1237
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,200
in our diet

1238
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,599
what it does is it rots the metal quick

1239
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:03,280
it starts to oxidize it so it rusts

1240
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:06,000
fats rust the metals in the brain

1241
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,240
so your condition worsens as time goes

1242
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,200
on

1243
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,520
and then the short circuit the

1244
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,839
electrical panel gets short-circuited

1245
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,000
and that's when that electrical panel

1246
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,359
gets

1247
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,640
zonked bonked out electricity is running

1248
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,520
through the brain your brain's made of

1249
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
electricity

1250
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,400
all the thoughts and everything all that

1251
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,520
electricity surging through the brain

1252
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,000
and it's hitting all these metal

1253
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,839
deposits and byproduct that's oxidized

1254
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,599
it's hitting it and then that's what's

1255
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,000
happening

1256
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,520
some people it's so bad if they go into

1257
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,800
mania manic moments

1258
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,079
some people they're up and down they're

1259
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,599
all over the place some people got the

1260
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,200
bipolar going some people just have the

1261
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,440
continual brain fog going

1262
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,880
some people have all the the above some

1263
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,720
people just have a little bit of it

1264
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
some people have some adhd some people

1265
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,560
just have a hard time focusing

1266
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
some people have migraines from it but

1267
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,599
whatever it is it all

1268
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,720
happens it's all because those metals

1269
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,720
live in there rent free

1270
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,280
and is that electricity circulating

1271
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,560
electricity circulating i showed you

1272
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,560
guys this right

1273
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,720
i showed you guys this so that

1274
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,680
electricity is circulating right

1275
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,880
okay and that pencil is a neuron inside

1276
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,079
the brain i showed you that right

1277
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,200
yesterday it's a neuron

1278
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,960
inside the brain right and you got metal

1279
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,640
in the middle of that neuron so when

1280
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,839
that electrical impulse comes down like

1281
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,480
here's the electrical impulse it's

1282
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,760
coming down

1283
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,359
that's your electricity because you're

1284
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,800
thinking of thought you're like hey you

1285
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,240
know what i gotta focus on this

1286
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,400
paperwork right now

1287
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,640
i can't my brain fog so bad i can't

1288
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,880
focus or i'm getting really emotional i

1289
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,240
can't explain it like i'm so emotional

1290
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,240
right now i just i can't

1291
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,160
it's like a sadness or i'm just i want

1292
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,319
to scream i don't know what it is

1293
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,280
well that neuro that that electrical

1294
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,599
impulse has come down

1295
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
and it's hitting the metal if you if

1296
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,599
it's ocd

1297
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,359
it's bouncing off the metal that means

1298
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
the deposit is in a spot in the brain

1299
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,800
where it's a larger deposit

1300
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,240
and that electrical impulse is coming

1301
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,720
down it's hitting the metal and bouncing

1302
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,640
back up

1303
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,560
and slamming into another another

1304
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,599
electrical impulse

1305
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,920
and that's ocd but you can have a

1306
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,960
combination of ocd and also

1307
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,760
also everything else too metal all

1308
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,760
through the brain

1309
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,359
savannah says so why someone will go

1310
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,680
bipolar

1311
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,839
some other autism what else affect the

1312
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,400
manifestation of disorder

1313
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,520
so as far as manifestation goes i'm not

1314
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,599
sure exactly what you mean by the

1315
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,000
manifestation but

1316
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,599
but as far as like how it works for some

1317
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,839
people i'll give you a little bit

1318
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,359
of a tidbit here okay this is the

1319
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,200
midline canal right

1320
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,480
there's a little there's a little canal

1321
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,800
that goes in the center of the brain

1322
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
right

1323
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,280
left hemisphere right hemisphere that

1324
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,800
fills up with metal when you're a child

1325
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,960
so all those medical treatments when

1326
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
we're a child that children are forced

1327
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,440
into to go to school and stuff all the

1328
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,119
medical treatments

1329
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,800
fills up that canal with all that

1330
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,319
mercury

1331
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,319
fills up the canal with all that

1332
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,000
aluminum and mercury right there

1333
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,079
so we get right off the running when

1334
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,720
we're children another thing too utero

1335
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,160
utero

1336
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,839
sperm and utero when we're a baby

1337
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,559
we get all that mercury in us too right

1338
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:09,359
here

1339
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,000
right then especially when pregnant

1340
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,920
women are

1341
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,160
pushed into medical treatments while

1342
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,680
they're pregnant right

1343
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,200
and so so then the baby's

1344
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,960
already developing with metal in the

1345
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,720
brain all this determines whether it's

1346
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,559
going to be autism to some degree or a

1347
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,440
larger degree how much mercury how much

1348
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,680
aluminum

1349
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,960
what's happening there how much adhd

1350
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
what's the difference between something

1351
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
that's going to be

1352
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,400
mania to something that's going to be

1353
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
different that something's just going to

1354
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,800
be depression

1355
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,559
something is just going to be focused

1356
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,400
and concentration but we got a

1357
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,920
fighting spirit when we're young we got

1358
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,160
a fighting will because we're trying to

1359
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,400
thrive so what happens human nature is

1360
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,760
when you're a child you have this you

1361
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,319
have this automatic

1362
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,160
bodies the body is programmed to thrive

1363
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,200
so you can grow as fast as possible and

1364
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,280
as healthy as possible

1365
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,160
so it's overriding a lot of what the

1366
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,160
metal causes

1367
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,839
but sometimes it doesn't override it

1368
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,839
enough

1369
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,880
and this is just some of the ways we get

1370
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,680
heavy metals and we get them in every

1371
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,160
way

1372
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,920
i said like the carpets carpet cleaning

1373
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,839
services that come in

1374
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,359
saturate us with toxic heavy metals

1375
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,640
perfumes colognes every time you smell

1376
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,640
perfume you got metal

1377
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,160
inside your body that's why the heavy

1378
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,440
metal detox smoothie is so important

1379
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,640
that's why the heavy metal cleanse is so

1380
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,640
important once in a while to do

1381
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,640
because we're just surrounded by metal

1382
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,720
you go into a store you're breathing an

1383
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,559
air freshener plus cologne plus perfume

1384
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,400
plus scented candles

1385
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,400
you go down the aisle in the grocery

1386
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,839
store that has all the conventional

1387
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,839
cleaning products

1388
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,480
believe it or not you go down the aisle

1389
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,760
in the non-conventional cleaning product

1390
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,760
the more natural stuff

1391
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,440
that stuff's saturated metal too in many

1392
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,880
ways

1393
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,559
you get it in the water you get it in

1394
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,079
the air you get at the coffee shop you

1395
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,000
get it at your coffee house

1396
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,119
the mosquito spray coming down i talked

1397
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,319
about that the other day

1398
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,359
the mosquito spray coming down right now

1399
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,119
there

1400
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,720
there's a deal with the mosquito spray

1401
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,760
companies

1402
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,880
and the governments

1403
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,440
just spray everybody dump it out of the

1404
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,520
sky

1405
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,520
it's never gotten rid of one mosquito

1406
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,079
it never kills off the mosquitoes

1407
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:32,240
but they but so what's happening is like

1408
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,440
our governments pay the chemical

1409
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,800
companies

1410
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,800
to slowly exterminate us

1411
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,280
that's what they do and they use their

1412
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,760
tax money

1413
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,839
that's what they do so they fill up all

1414
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,920
their planes with mosquito spray

1415
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,599
from from you know courtesy of the

1416
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,640
chemical companies

1417
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,440
our tax dollars pay and they

1418
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,119
dump mosquito spray dangerous lethal

1419
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,640

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,599
mosquitoes are always there they can go

1422
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,319
by and dump all that spray

1423
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,079
to exterminate us but the mosquitoes

1424
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,240
will still be there flying around

1425
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,240
you'll still be like mosquito

human people

1442
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,119
for humans i don't know about aliens

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,839
from other planets and other solar

1445
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,839
systems and galaxies

1446
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,480

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,880
but then the conditions and symptoms

1455
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,319
happen the asthma really happens the

1456
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,079
asthma gets really bad

down on everybody your neurosis

1462
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,000
psychosis ocd can get worse and worse

1463
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,680
and worse

1464
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,520
everything can get worse and worse and

1465
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,599
worse they do it every year

1466
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,119
they dump it on everybody and that's all

1467
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,119
metal and metal and

1468
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,119
metal and neurotoxic methyl metal

1469
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,920
conditions and symptoms depend on where

1470
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,040
the metal is in the brain is the metal

1471
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,200
in the frontal lobe

1472
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,119
is the metal sitting on the optic nerve

1473
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,559
it's the metal in the pituitary area

1474
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,640
it's the metal in the hypothalamus it's

1475
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,599
the metal in the brain stem

1476
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,280
is the metal where's the metal how much

1477
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,119
metal and where and how much

1478
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,720
and what kind of metal is it mercury's

1479
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,400
aluminum is a little bit of arsenic

1480
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,000
is it a little bit of lead what kind of

1481
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,680
metal is going on and they mix

1482
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,280
and they mix and then electricity hits

1483
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,319
the metal left and right hits the metal

1484
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,760
left and right

1485
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,319
they just michelle l said they just

1486
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,920

1605
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,880
the heavy metal detox smoothie gives me

1606
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,880
headaches why

1607
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,960
i would be your own detective that's the

1608
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,520
only time you've ever had a headache

1609
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,280
or are you coming down with the flu

1610
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,119
you're coming down with something

1611
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,799
at the same time you start at the

1612
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,799
cleanse

1613
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:55,839
did you already have headaches nothing

1614
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,000
else gives you a headache you can eat a

1615
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,359
vegan pizza not have a headache but you

1616
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,599
have a heavy metal detox smoothie and it

1617
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:03,359
gives you a headache

1618
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,920
i just want you to be a detective your

1619
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,160
own detective right

1620
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,040
if for some reason you are experiencing

1621
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,520
that from

1622
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,480
the heavy metal detox smoothie lower the

1623
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,000
dose

1624
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,680
make a tiny one or put tiny amounts of

1625
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,559
everything in it

1626
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,240
and see how it is if you're that toxic

1627
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,359
super toxic but the heavy metal detox

1628
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,040
smoothie

1629
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:29,440
removes toxins without shaking them up

1630
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,280
so it doesn't give people headaches

1631
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,880
because it removes the toxins it doesn't

1632
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,480
shake up the toxins

1633
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,079
but what you can do is

1634
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,520
you can do smaller smaller smaller

1635
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,520
amount you can try that

1636
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,280
i mean it's amazing you're trying to do

1637
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,480
it you're doing it so i support you in

1638
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,520
any way you're doing it you've got to

1639
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,839
use a tiny amount

1640
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,720
you can always try and that's what i

1641
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:54,400
would say

1642
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,119
i've i've told uh i've told people who

1643
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,599
also

1644
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,440
are sensitive in general that they start

1645
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,640
with a little bit of everything is fine

1646
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,480
and that there's nothing wrong with a

1647
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,920
lot of people are afraid to do stuff too

1648
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,599
because they're sensitive you're like

1649
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,680
afraid to try something you think oh

1650
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,680
do just a little bit and then you'll

1651
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,559
build up the confidence as you go along

1652
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,160
right

1653
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,799
that's the uh vimergy wild blueberry

1654
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,040
powder

1655
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,559
if you don't have another thing too like

1656
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,960
what creates headaches

1657
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,880
well bananas and wild blueberries aren't

1658
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,240
going to create headaches

1659
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:30,160
but but uh metals do

1660
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,839

starting the heavy metal detox cleanse

1671
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,920

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,359
realizing it

1673
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,640

supplement company right

1694
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,559
that refuses to allow manufacturing

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,000
to put in a small percentage of

1696
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,599
something nobody knows they're getting

1697
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,760
in every other supplement so if you're

there's a small percentage of something

1701
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,760
in there you don't know

1702
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,040
shouldn't be in there if you like a

1703
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,559
zeolite product

1704
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,839
there's a small percentage of something

1705
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,160
in there shouldn't be in there if you

1706
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,119
like

1707
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,480
a diatomaceous earth product if you like

1708
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,839
that then there's a certain thing that

1709
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,480
nobody knows if you like a bentonite

1710
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,760
clay

01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,880
there's a certain percentage of

1712
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,280
something that shouldn't be in there if

1713
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,960

1714
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,440

1715
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,680
something that shouldn't be in there

1716
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,440
i'm just saying and some of those

1717
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,760

and i knocked over the blender and

1726
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,119
everything just fell apart

1727
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,839
but vimergy doesn't have those hidden

1728
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,280
things

1729
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:37,760
hidden sinisterly

1730
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,960

and be like

1752
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:15,280
did you guys change something

1753
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,920
and that's why i ditched the pacific the

1754
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,920
the specific spirulina i ditched it

1755
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,720
i like the imagery stuff pacific

01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,280
spirulina they never contacted me back

1757
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,760
i tried to become friends with them

1758
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,319
because

1759
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,240
i was seeing problems and they never

1760
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,240
contacted me back

1761
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,760

1763
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,839

1764
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:41,119

1765
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:44,480
need my people to be okay

1766
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:47,039
and vimergy you know

1767
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,839
you know they're like they're really

1768
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,839
special people

1769
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,200
anyway you guys know i'm working with

1770
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,720
wyman's though i'm not sponsored by them

1771
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,880
but i'm working with wyman's and they're

1772
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,160
they're amazing people too

1773
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,680
and they call me back

1774
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,319
that's how that's what happened you know

1775
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,880
like it's like if you're gonna like

1776
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,359
if you're gonna like make sure stuff is

1777
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,680
right

1778
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,720
and not changing and stuff is incredible

1779
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,240
you want

1780
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,520
you want communication and then

1781
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,280
friendships develop through that

1782
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,240
communication and it's good because it's

1783
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,160
like okay

1784
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,079
keep everything at the top grade at the

1785
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,880
top notch the highest quality possible

1786
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,280
and hey

1787
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,400
it even should be like this and all

1788
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,920
right so

1789
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,319
i put some spirulina in here let's talk

1790
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,359
about spirulina a little bit spirulina

1791
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:38,640
is light years from chlorella

1792
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:41,280
chlorella disastrous

1793
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,200
disastrous just letting you know

1794
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,000
chlorella doesn't remove toxic heavy

1795
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,760
metals and

1796
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,039
if it does it will drop it and and and

1797
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:54,160
basically drag it

1798
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,200
that means if it ever does unloot so

1799
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,960
here's how it works

1800
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,200
so if you're told by your practitioner

1801
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,880
your naturopath your chiropractor

1802
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,480
you're told by your influencer who's

1803
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,680
saying i'm taking chlorella because i'm

1804
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,440
getting metals out

1805
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,359
metals they only know about now because

1806
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,839
of medical medium information for 35

1807
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,599
years

1808
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,880
and if you some influence or if some

1809
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,480
chiropractor or some nd

1810
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,319
or some functional medicine doctor says

1811
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,079
here's a chlorella product or

1812
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,680
you find a chlorella product out there

1813
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,599
somewhere right

1814
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,119
and you're like it's and you read about

1815
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,920
it's like yeah chlorella takes out

1816
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,359
metals

1817
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,280
yeah if it ever did take out metal

1818
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:29,680
here's what happens with chlorella

1819
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,720
it drags the metal and worsens the

1820
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,760
disease or condition

1821
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,039
it drags it and drops it that's what

1822
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,480
chlorella does

1823
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,319
drags it and drops what would i have

1824
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,000
against chlorella what would i

1825
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,920
if it worked i'd be like chlorella

1826
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,680
chlorella i'd be like everybody should

1827
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,400
be on chlorella if it worked i'd be like

1828
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,559
chlorella

1829
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,319
here for the thousandth time i'm gonna

1830
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,240
show you chlorella you guys

1831
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,079
like i show you everything else what

1832
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,520
would what would i have against it it

1833
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,280
doesn't work

1834
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,599
it doesn't work it's disastrous

1835
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,280
but that's not why i hate chlorella the

1836
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,520
most

1837
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,880
in fact that it drags the metal if it

1838
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,880
does pick it up

1839
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,559
and worsens the disease or condition or

1840
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,920
symptom like anxiety or depression or

1841
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,400
anything

1842
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,079
right that's not that's one but that's

1843
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,960
not the worst reason why

1844
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,359
the worst reason why is because bacteria

1845
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,960
that's

1846
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:27,760
bad thrives in chlorella

1847
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,760
spirulina is antibacterial

1848
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,000
antibacterial chlorella

1849
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,000
is bacterial

1850
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,280
that's why many people have been like

1851
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,880
and attached to their toilet for weeks

1852
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,599
because of getting poisoned by chlorella

1853
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:52,240
because it's not even tested properly

1854
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:55,520
because it's a magnet for bad bacteria

1855
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,440
that means it feeds the bad stuff inside

1856
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,440
you let me take my chlorella and feed

1857
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,760
every bad bacteria and bug i got inside

1858
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,760
of me

1859
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,119
and make sure i get sicker down the road

1860
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,520
that's chlorella

1861
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,119
you know what sucks you guys check this

1862
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,119

1863
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,839
you know what really really you know

1864
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,720
it's really hard

1865
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,680
and i understand i sympathize i really

1866
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,280
do

1867
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,680
just hear me out if you got a minute if

1868
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:25,200
you just got one second okay

1869
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:28,000
if i was a doctor

1870
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,680
and i was and i spent 10 years pushing

1871
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,440
chlorella

1872
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,039
you think i would want to be told i'm

1873
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,760
wrong

1874
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,880
or that i've been giving my patients

1875
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,119
for 10 years no i'm going to fight for

1876
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,880
it

1877
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,039
and i'm going to stand my ground because

1878
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:49,039
i am not going to be mud

1879
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:50,640
if i was a healer or naturopathic doctor

1880
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,079
out there

1881
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:57,280
or chiropractor

1882
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,280
if i was an influencer

1883
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,400
that was pushing something for a few

1884
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,839
years

1885
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,400
and i told my whole crowd this is what

1886
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:09,920
gets chlorella chlorella chlorella

1887
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,640
even if i learn the truth it's hard to

1888
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,160
be like

1889
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,400
oh i was wrong

1890
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,200
it's hard to just chalk it up and be

1891
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,520
like

1892
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,799
a chiropractor that's like uh i've been

1893
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,760
giving you chlorella

1894
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,559
all these years telling you what's good

1895
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,039
um

1896
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,359
i'm probably wrong i'm hearing and i'm

1897
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:34,000
wrong i'm not gonna

1898
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:37,440
admit it here's chlorella here you go

1899
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
here you go here's clarella here you go

1900
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,599
same thing with anything same thing with

1901
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,599
all the different stuff if you're

1902
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,359
been pushing coffee enemas for 20 years

1903
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,000
in your practice

1904
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,599
coffee enemas are absolutely disastrous

1905
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,240
disastrous

1906
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,760
they just kill the the nervous system

1907
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,920
weaken the immune system

1908
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,160
destroy the nervous system coffee enemas

1909
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,920
are a tragedy

1910
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:03,680
right and if i was a practitioner and

1911
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,720
i'm telling people to eat coffee animals

1912
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,839
for 10 years

1913
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:11,839
you think i'm gonna stop and say i was

1914
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,839
wrong

1915
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:21,920
no way meaning like

1916
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,920
a lot won't maybe some will

1917
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,719
is coffee enema bad too horrible

1918
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:30,000
horrible

1919
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:35,199
and i simplify i do i do if i was wrong

1920
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:38,159
i would say it i screwed up i'm wrong

1921
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,000
but i'm lucky because i'm not the one

1922
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:43,080
calling the shots

1923
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,839
i'm not that doctor that's hearing

1924
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,600
misinformation and then giving you some

1925
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,239
coffee enema and saying it's good for

1926
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,679
you

1927
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:54,719
i got my source my source is not

1928
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,799
a man my source is not meaning men

1929
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,040
on the planet a human being on the

1930
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:02,319
planet my source is not

1931
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,359
my source is not a human being who makes

1932
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,319
mistakes

1933
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,000
and then says yeah you can do chlorella

1934
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,880
yeah you can do

1935
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,440
you know mercury fillings in the 1920s

1936
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:17,440
30s 40s 50s 60s 70s and 80s

1937
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:20,560
90s 2000s you can do mercury fillings

1938
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,199
my source isn't that so so that's the

1939
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,040
difference

1940
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,319
but i get it when you don't have that

1941
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,000
source

1942
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,359
where i get the information from since i

1943
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,839
was age four if you don't have that

1944
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,359
source

1945
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,960
you can make the mistakes and you could

1946
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,080
be giving out coffee

1947
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,319
enemas for years and then if you're even

1948
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,279
if you're even told hey that's really

1949
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,080
bad because

1950
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,839
your stomach buffers the caffeine to at

1951
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,440
least protect you a little bit but when

1952
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,120
you get coffee the other end like the

1953
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,799
coffee animal the other end up

1954
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,560
that you have nothing to buffer it and

1955
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,480
it goes straight to your nervous system

1956
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,480
and it starts to annihilate your vagus

1957
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,760
nerve so when you do coffee enemas

1958
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,000
you're doing vagus nerve damage

1959
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,440
and then that chiropractor that doctor's

1960
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,840
gonna be like i'm not gonna

1961
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,840
i can't stop i just i just spent 15

1962
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,440
years invested in coffee enemas giving

1963
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,760
all my patients coffee enemas

1964
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,679
and i can't tell them to stop i can't

1965
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,880
say i can't admit i was wrong

1966
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:15,120
i wrote a an e-book about coffee enemas

1967
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,320
how could i admit i'm wrong no you fight

1968
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,520
for it

1969
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,520
who cares about the people i get it

1970
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,719
okay let's make the smoothie let's get

1971
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:32,239
two bananas in there you guys

1972

but there are some good doctors that say

1973
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,440
you know what i heard that coffee enemas

1974
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,040
are bad

1975
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,120
i'm gonna stop doing that i heard

01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:51,679
i heard pacific spirulina

1980
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,679
is garbage

1981
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,120
and i'm gonna tell my patients there's

1982
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,080
some incredible doctors that do do that

1983
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,400
don't get me wrong

1984
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,880
but no one's held accountable for all

1985
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,199
the mistakes in alternative medicine

1986
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,199

it'll get you

1995
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,320
high if you're strong enough to handle

1996
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,840
the high that the caffeine gives you

1997
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,159
thinking that you did something good for

1998
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,440
yourself but if you're not strong enough

1999
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,360
to handle that high

2000
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,199
and you're weaker because you're injured

2001
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,640
and sick and you're sick you're viral

2002
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:52,560
and you're sick your nervous system

2003
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,560
that coffee enema will send you down

2004
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:59,520
to an early grave cilantro

2005
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,480
poisons the heart and brain puts it into

2006
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,239
shock cilantro

2007
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,000
goes into the brain and helps to remove

2008
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,120
toxicated metals it's got phytochemical

2009
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,480
compounds attached

2010
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,840
to the mineral salts trace mineral salts

2011
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,360
when you combine that with the wild

2012
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,080
blueberry and you've got the spirulina

2013
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,679
in there

2014
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,520
and that's the demergie spirulina by the

2015
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:21,520
way right you got the spirulina in there

2016
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,880
um if you don't like the taste of that

2017
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,840
cilantro that's because you've got a lot

01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,040
of medical medium talking about people

2074
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,440
having bugs in them

2075
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,040
back in the mid 80s so teaching you know

2076
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,520
in early 80s when i was like

2077
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,400
like full throttle teaching people every

2078
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,719
day about

2079
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,800
about um people having bugs and people

2080
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,000
having viruses and everybody's like what

2081
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,400
little parasites no parasite

2082
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,199
thing came out of dysentery the amoeba

2083
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,040
that's in bad

2084
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,960
water that's where the parasite thing

2085
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,719
developed but then it took off after the

2086
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,520
whole viral thing i was talking about

2087
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,840
and then by the

2088
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,159
early 2000s it was like we keep on

2089
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,400
hearing about viruses for medical medium

2090
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,159
but isn't it a parasite that we need to

2091
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,679
be talking about and then worms

2092
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,840
and then there you go again back to the

2093
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:09,040
warm thing everybody's trying to bank

2094
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,199

blender i need to make it at

2102
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,280
zero three three zero how long can it

2103
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,320
sit

2104
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,159
in the fridge before i need to

2105
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,280

2106
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,800
fridge i can sit in the fridge for a

2107
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,120
while you might need a spoon

2108
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,040
for the smoothie because it congeals

2109
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,679
because of the wild blueberry pectin

2110
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,960
it couldn't it congeals right so you you

2111
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,159

24 well 12 hours

2115
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,120
i probably wouldn't let it go past 12

2116
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,520
hours i probably wouldn't let it go past

2117
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,560

if it's still as effective as a natural

2149
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,239

2160
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:24,880

it's scan medical medium information

2184
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,320
because no one

2185
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:46,480
no one in alternative medicine has like

2186
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,679
information like if you read the medical

2187
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,600
books if you read

2188
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,440
the the medical books right the medical

2189
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,040
media medical books if you read these

2190

you'll see how much information is in

2191
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,640
here right so what's happening is the

2192
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,199
new scam is to take

2193
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,400
data from these books not cite it back

2194
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:03,360
to medical medium

2195
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,480
write posts about it post it and then

2196
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,000
they get a bunch of people commenting

2197
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,360
like oh my god i didn't know that

2198
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,120
and meanwhile the practitioner or the

2199
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,040
influencer isn't even even

2200
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,159
isn't even mentioning medical medium but

2201
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,679
they look like a hero

2202
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:15,280
because they're they're talking about

2203
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,679
stuff you can never get anywhere else

2204
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,440
right

2205
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,040
and then they recommend stuff that's bad

2206
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,080
for you

2207
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,159

seeing it every minute right now out

2209
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,440
there and then the person can't heal

2210
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,600
because they don't really know

2211
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,880

and you can't keep track of all the of

2229
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,040
all the

2230
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,239
you know the shenanigans that are

2231
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:27,840
happening out there

2232
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:27,840
you know anyway apples

2233
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,880
try to do a couple apples before noon

2234
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,320
keep the radical fats out before noon

2235
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,840
try to keep them out try

2236
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,280
try the best if you're somebody that

2237
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,880
still wants to have your avocado toast

2238
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,280
and your heavy metal detox smoothie

2239
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,239
i welcome that but but if you want the

2240
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,920
best out of it

2241
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,239
what you if you want to really kick some

2242
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,360
serious butt and get metals out quicker

2243
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:54,000
do the heavy metal detox cleanse without

2244
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,800
having anything any any fat at all in

2245
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,560
the morning

2246
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,320
try to be fat free where you're just

2247
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,600
doing the smoothie you're doing your

2248
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,280
lemon water of course you know the

2249
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,320
rhythm and then your celery juice and

2250
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,480
then the smoothie

2251
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,159
and you got that the problem is with the

2252
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,840
fats is it thickens up the blood so it

2253
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,440
makes it harder to get metals out

2254
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,960
even though you can still get some out

2255
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,679
each day if that's what you do but try

2256
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,440
to do

2257
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,199
fats at the end of the day this way you

2258
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,639
can get metals out all morning and

2259
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,920
afternoon and then the fats at the end

2260
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,360
of the day so you could do your avocado

2261
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,960
your nuts or seeds if that's what you

2262
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,639
live off of that's what you like

2263
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,320
you do all that stuff then and your

2264
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,320
olive oil whatever it is that you like

2265
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,159
and your chicken your meat this is an

2266
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,520
anti-animal protein or anti-plant-based

2267
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:31,040

2268
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,520

2269
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,080

in the alternative health movement that

2272
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,679
