[0.72 - 3.96] okay we're ready
[2.40 - 5.64] we're talking about the immune system
[3.96 - 7.74] how it protects the brain and how the
[5.64 - 10.26] brain relies on the immune system we're
[7.74 - 13.40] in the brain saver books you guys
[10.26 - 17.22] books that are mind boggling
[13.40 - 18.90] mind-blowing like seriously and there's
[17.22 - 21.26] so much information in the brain saver
[18.90 - 24.18] books there's two brain saver books okay
[21.26 - 26.94] there's so much information in these
[24.18 - 30.42] it's line for line for line I promise
[26.94 - 33.54] you the greatest books of all time hands
[30.42 - 36.06] down in health these will go down as the
[33.54 - 38.28] greatest books ever in health I can
[36.06 - 41.12] stand behind that I can say it with
[38.28 - 44.94] being proud I can say it with confidence
[41.12 - 47.34] the greatest books in history in health
[44.94 - 49.62] no one can touch them science research
[47.34 - 50.82] can't touch them nobody can touch what's
[49.62 - 52.80] in these books and what they're going to
[50.82 - 54.68] do for people to move their their lives
[52.80 - 57.30] forward with sickness and illness
[54.68 - 58.92] nothing will compare there will never be
[57.30 - 60.60] a book out there by any other health
[58.92 - 63.66] author any other health you know
[60.60 - 66.30] industry that can ever touch the
[63.66 - 68.48] original unique incredible mind-blowing
[66.30 - 71.16] comprehensive detailed information
[68.48 - 73.44] that's in the brain favorite books it
[71.16 - 75.96] will never ever happen again you're
[73.44 - 77.10] witnessing history I can say this if
[75.96 - 78.54] you're somebody that came on here and
[77.10 - 79.98] you don't own medical medium or medical
[78.54 - 81.90] medium information you're saying well
[79.98 - 83.46] he's biased it's his books uh they're
[81.90 - 86.40] not my books
[83.46 - 88.92] it comes from above I'm a messenger that
[86.40 - 90.54] got the information placed it into the
[88.92 - 93.36] books
[90.54 - 97.38] and yes the books are there for the
[93.36 - 98.88] people and these the reason why I sound
[97.38 - 100.44] a little snarky about that is because
[98.88 - 102.36] someone was like oh yeah but they're
[100.44 - 104.70] they're your books and the reason why
[102.36 - 108.42] I'm snark is like okay yeah sure but the
[104.70 - 111.54] information came from above I'm not that
[108.42 - 116.04] smart and if you believe it didn't come
[111.54 - 118.74] from above and you believe that I'm that
[116.04 - 120.18] I created this information that's in the
[118.74 - 123.12] medical meaning book series and in the
[120.18 - 125.34] brain saver books then okay I'm a genius
[123.12 - 128.94] I'm a genius then I don't know what to
[125.34 - 130.62] say I must be a genius he's a genius
[128.94 - 134.10] everybody
[130.62 - 137.64] but I'm not a genius Valerie said you're
[134.10 - 140.76] pretty smart aw I'm not a genius
[137.64 - 142.50] the information in these books is so
[140.76 - 143.40] Advanced it's a head of science and
[142.50 - 146.76] research
[143.40 - 149.10] real solutions real causes real truth
[146.76 - 150.60] you can't find this anywhere else you
[149.10 - 152.94] will never find this anywhere else I
[150.60 - 154.86] could say this proud the information
[152.94 - 158.52] came down
[154.86 - 161.82] I put it in the books it's here and I'm
[158.52 - 163.98] not a genius for sure and when you read
[161.82 - 168.44] these books because no one could make
[163.98 - 171.42] this up it can't even be made up
[168.44 - 174.42] none of it can just like in the medical
[171.42 - 175.80] medium books and it paves the way in
[174.42 - 177.66] alternative medicine and conventional
[175.80 - 180.42] medicine because they poach and steal
[177.66 - 183.60] from the mm books mm publishes it first
[180.42 - 185.94] and they poach and steal it and of
[183.60 - 187.68] course they they you know and then they
[185.94 - 190.14] put slander on medical me but the point
[187.68 - 191.70] is is this is literally a time in
[190.14 - 193.74] history that's very special the brain
[191.70 - 194.70] saver books I'm talking about the immune
[193.74 - 197.04] system
[194.70 - 198.84] how the brain relies on your immune
[197.04 - 201.48] system to protect it
[198.84 - 204.18] the brain relies on your immune system
[201.48 - 207.24] to protect it okay and so that's
[204.18 - 210.84] important to know all on its own so
[207.24 - 213.48] here I am let me move these for now
[210.84 - 216.48] move them over
[213.48 - 219.06] if you don't have a copy
[216.48 - 221.16] maybe someday you will I want to talk
[219.06 - 223.02] about cleaning your book too which is
[221.16 - 224.34] interesting so we're going to talk about
[223.02 - 225.90] that in a little bit but let's get
[224.34 - 229.08] through this
[225.90 - 232.50] our immune system
[229.08 - 236.40] they fight our immune system fights
[232.50 - 239.28] to defend us our brain relies on your
[236.40 - 241.26] immune system now I'm just giving you a
[239.28 - 243.48] forewarning here talked about how the
[241.26 - 245.16] brain shot therapy is so powerful that
[243.48 - 246.60] you're gonna get into that instant
[245.16 - 249.36] relief and it's going to be an
[246.60 - 252.24] experience that isn't explainable unless
[249.36 - 254.88] you experience it yourself honest to God
[252.24 - 257.22] but I'm also talking about every line in
[254.88 - 259.14] these books both these books
[257.22 - 261.86] every line
[259.14 - 264.42] is jammed packed with with information
[261.86 - 267.32] highly detailed information so let's get
[264.42 - 267.32] into it a little bit
[268.02 - 272.64] there's no way humankind could
[270.24 - 274.44] physically evolve faster than any of
[272.64 - 276.78] these forces against us just listen to
[274.44 - 279.84] that one line just one line
[276.78 - 282.66] out of thousands of lines in these books
[279.84 - 285.84] there's no way
[282.66 - 289.68] humankind could physically evolve faster
[285.84 - 291.96] than any of these forces against us
[289.68 - 294.48] which brings us to the immune system so
[291.96 - 298.38] what that means is
[294.48 - 301.26] we can't out evolve
[298.38 - 303.72] the chemical poisons the toxins the
[301.26 - 305.16] exposures the garbage that our bodies
[303.72 - 307.20] are faced everybody's getting kicked off
[305.16 - 309.06] IG today unbelievable so they really
[307.20 - 310.92] have it censored heavy
[309.06 - 312.84] so
[310.92 - 316.26] the whole point here that we're talking
[312.84 - 319.80] about is when it comes down to it we
[316.26 - 322.74] can't beat out the speed in which the
[319.80 - 325.14] Earth is polluting our brains
[322.74 - 326.70] so we need to be active in doing
[325.14 - 328.38] something we have to learn how to
[326.70 - 330.66] protect our brains we have to take care
[328.38 - 333.60] of ourselves we have to have the answers
[330.66 - 335.82] because right now
[333.60 - 337.74] I mean the amount of people sick and the
[335.82 - 339.72] amount of people dying is unbelievable
[337.74 - 342.48] never before in history and it's all
[339.72 - 344.70] kept hush hush hush hush out there
[342.48 - 346.50] but never before in history have we seen
[344.70 - 348.30] the amount of people dying and the
[346.50 - 350.58] amount of people being sick globally
[348.30 - 353.46] like it is right now it's unbelievable
[350.58 - 355.26] unprecedented right
[353.46 - 357.36] so this brings us to the immune system
[355.26 - 359.10] which is responsible for protecting the
[357.36 - 361.56] brain so our immune system has a
[359.10 - 363.48] responsibility our immune cells have a
[361.56 - 366.30] responsibility it's to protect our brain
[363.48 - 368.16] our immune systems were never made for
[366.30 - 370.08] what's evolving around us and that's a
[368.16 - 372.48] problem all on its own our immune system
[370.08 - 376.26] was never built
[372.48 - 379.32] to handle what we are up against what is
[376.26 - 381.36] being evolved around us like the
[379.32 - 384.90] onslaught of everything we're up against
[381.36 - 386.76] our immune systems were never created to
[384.90 - 388.50] deal with that so we have to do
[386.76 - 390.24] something we have to support our immune
[388.50 - 394.70] systems we have to support our body
[390.24 - 394.70] because it was never Geared for that
[395.88 - 401.28] they weren't designed to fight off
[397.62 - 404.04] engineered bugs that were manufactured
[401.28 - 405.96] they weren't designed to deal with
[404.04 - 407.82] toxins the our immune systems weren't
[405.96 - 409.26] made to put up with all the amount of
[407.82 - 411.48] chemicals
[409.26 - 413.10] so our immune systems were never put up
[411.48 - 414.90] with the amount of chemicals were up
[413.10 - 416.28] against it was never put up they were
[414.90 - 417.96] never our immune systems were never
[416.28 - 419.88] created to deal with all the different
[417.96 - 423.06] bugs and viruses like Epstein-Barr and
[419.88 - 425.46] shingles and hhv6 and all the all the
[423.06 - 427.98] different viral infections people have
[425.46 - 429.84] our immune systems were never designed
[427.98 - 431.64] to deal with chemicals this is something
[429.84 - 432.84] that our immune systems have been put up
[431.64 - 435.12] against
[432.84 - 436.92] and everything's evolving around our
[435.12 - 438.60] immune systems and our immune system's
[436.92 - 440.52] job is to protect the brain and the
[438.60 - 443.10] brain is relying on that
[440.52 - 444.72] so there's things we can do to protect
[443.10 - 446.40] our immune systems and to protect our
[444.72 - 449.52] brain there's things we can do to
[446.40 - 453.74] actually help our bodies
[449.52 - 453.74] I mean that's incredible all on its own
[453.84 - 458.94] our immune system was never designed to
[456.60 - 462.42] be up against EMF
[458.94 - 466.32] evolving around us right so EMF used to
[462.42 - 471.84] just be this radio signals in the 1920s
[466.32 - 475.38] the 1930s and 1940s radio signals
[471.84 - 477.90] that was the first Onslaught against our
[475.38 - 479.76] immune systems and our brain was radio
[477.90 - 483.12] signals
[479.76 - 486.54] that was the EMF of the day no biggie
[483.12 - 488.34] was radio signals you know
[486.54 - 490.20] so think about that right now how
[488.34 - 492.18] interesting that is but our immune
[490.20 - 495.36] systems were never designed for the
[492.18 - 498.42] evolving EMF we're up against now
[495.36 - 500.70] and the cell tower signaling that we're
[498.42 - 502.56] up against now our immune systems were
[500.70 - 505.16] never designed for that for cell tower
[502.56 - 505.16] signals
[505.50 - 508.98] our immune systems were never designed
[507.36 - 510.96] to deal with the radiation we're up
[508.98 - 513.42] against now you guys so that's something
[510.96 - 517.56] that's a whole other level every time
[513.42 - 519.36] something foreign enters into our body
[517.56 - 521.40] whether it's EMF
[519.36 - 523.80] whether it's radiation
[521.40 - 527.96] whether it's pathogenic
[523.80 - 527.96] whether it's a toxic chemical
[528.00 - 533.10] every time something foreign enters into
[530.76 - 535.80] our body even if it's in the form of
[533.10 - 537.60] radiation our immune cells have to
[535.80 - 540.12] gobble it up
[537.60 - 544.10] really important to know
[540.12 - 549.42] so every time we are up against anything
[544.10 - 551.70] our immune cells have to eat it
[549.42 - 554.28] have to gobble it up to protect our
[551.70 - 555.42] brain so our brain's relying on this so
[554.28 - 558.72] as
[555.42 - 560.88] times are evolving
[558.72 - 564.42] and we have
[560.88 - 567.42] this attack this industry attack on our
[564.42 - 569.52] physical bodies
[567.42 - 573.72] as that's happening our brain is like
[569.52 - 575.94] wait a minute here I'm relying on your
[573.72 - 578.58] immune I'm relying on our immune system
[575.94 - 581.04] you guys our brains talking like I'm
[578.58 - 582.90] relying on your immune system
[581.04 - 585.12] hey I'm relying on your immune system
[582.90 - 586.62] like our brain is like
[585.12 - 588.42] literally
[586.62 - 590.82] screaming
[588.42 - 593.58] our immune system has to save us and
[590.82 - 596.58] protect us has to protect the brain
[593.58 - 598.32] our brain has an intelligence our brain
[596.58 - 601.32] has a metaphysical and physical
[598.32 - 603.18] intelligence to know it's in trouble
[601.32 - 607.70] with what we're up against all the time
[603.18 - 610.62] between EMF and pathogenic problems and
[607.70 - 612.80] radiation and toxic chemicals and all of
[610.62 - 612.80] that
[614.40 - 621.66] our immune system is the security system
[618.72 - 624.36] against any attackers that want to
[621.66 - 626.40] invade our brain think about that so
[624.36 - 629.30] your immune system is the security
[626.40 - 629.30] system
[630.36 - 634.88] to actually stop attackers
[635.16 - 640.04] to stop brain crime
[640.50 - 646.38] our immune system
[642.36 - 648.84] has a big job in defending our brain
[646.38 - 651.48] so our brain is desperate
[648.84 - 653.40] relies heavily
[651.48 - 655.98] on our immune system
[653.40 - 658.86] now check this out this is mind-blowing
[655.98 - 660.96] all on its own right here
[658.86 - 663.30] how long a white blood cell lasts
[660.96 - 664.92] against a toxic Invader depends on how
[663.30 - 667.80] toxic the substance is and that's
[664.92 - 669.48] something that's huge all on its own
[667.80 - 671.34] now one thing you'll find in the brain
[669.48 - 672.84] saver books
[671.34 - 675.30] is your
[672.84 - 678.00] be educated on all the different things
[675.30 - 680.16] we have to be concerned about
[678.00 - 682.68] which is a big deal because that's so
[680.16 - 684.06] important we need to be aware of of
[682.68 - 685.92] what's going on
[684.06 - 687.48] but people don't realize a lot of the
[685.92 - 689.16] stuff they have in their life and that
[687.48 - 690.72] they're partaking in their life is
[689.16 - 692.40] breaking down their immune system and
[690.72 - 694.02] they don't realize that and that's
[692.40 - 696.06] really sad when you think about it all
[694.02 - 699.74] on its own they don't know their immune
[696.06 - 699.74] system is being broke down
[699.90 - 704.42] how long a white blood cell how long a
[702.72 - 706.08] white blood cell
[704.42 - 710.06] lasts
[706.08 - 710.06] against the toxic invader
[710.64 - 715.26] okay
[712.08 - 718.50] depends on how toxic the substance is
[715.26 - 721.62] so your white blood cells job is to
[718.50 - 724.62] gobble up anything in its way anything
[721.62 - 727.08] that's heading to the brain EMF guess
[724.62 - 729.72] what your immune cells are trying to
[727.08 - 733.34] gobble up EMF radiation your immune
[729.72 - 733.34] cells are trying to gobble up radiation
[735.18 - 739.82] pathogens like that one your immune
[738.24 - 742.20] cells are trying to gobble up pathogens
[739.82 - 743.88] toxic chemicals your immune system is
[742.20 - 746.46] trying to gobble up toxic chemicals
[743.88 - 748.74] depending on how powerful that EMF is
[746.46 - 752.60] how strong that radiation is how toxic
[748.74 - 755.64] that chemical is how toxic that bug is
[752.60 - 757.50] determines the lifespan of that white
[755.64 - 760.76] blood cell that immune cell it
[757.50 - 760.76] determines the lifespan
[760.98 - 763.94] that's insane
[764.78 - 770.34] nanopoisons from perfume and cologne
[767.88 - 772.68] have to be gobbled up by our white blood
[770.34 - 774.18] cells what
[772.68 - 776.22] what
[774.18 - 780.36] so anytime you get you breathe in
[776.22 - 784.58] perfume your whites blood cells have to
[780.36 - 784.58] gobble up the perfume particles
[785.04 - 790.98] whoa Nano poisons like perfume and
[788.58 - 792.24] cologne have to be gobbled up by our
[790.98 - 793.62] white blood cells this is why when
[792.24 - 794.76] people are breathing in Cologne and
[793.62 - 796.98] they're sick and they're chronically ill
[794.76 - 798.60] that clone just weakens them more makes
[796.98 - 800.58] them sick brings on their migraines
[798.60 - 802.74] brings on their sinus problems brings on
[800.58 - 803.94] their fatigue even worse and more to the
[802.74 - 806.46] point where they're just tasting the
[803.94 - 808.44] cologne and it's so sickening
[806.46 - 809.94] but your immune cells if you already
[808.44 - 811.62] have a weak immune system and generally
[809.94 - 815.30] immune cells have to gobble up every
[811.62 - 815.30] part of that cologne nanoparticle
[816.14 - 821.76] and cologne's not natural
[819.66 - 824.82] none of that stuff's natural it's
[821.76 - 827.00] chemical created lab created
[824.82 - 829.68] important to know
[827.00 - 831.90] nanoparticles from air fresheners and
[829.68 - 833.82] scented candles have to be gobbled up is
[831.90 - 835.14] the only one talking about plug-in air
[833.82 - 837.18] fresheners
[835.14 - 838.98] for years and years and now you'll see
[837.18 - 841.56] on social media like some kind of doctor
[838.98 - 843.54] influence or something pretending that
[841.56 - 845.52] he just figured it out yesterday or
[843.54 - 848.52] something that air fresheners are bad
[845.52 - 850.80] but doesn't even cite mm but yet is
[848.52 - 853.62] listening to the podcasts and listening
[850.80 - 856.14] to everything but doesn't cite it back
[853.62 - 857.52] so that people can find their way and
[856.14 - 859.80] then they and then they sell the person
[857.52 - 861.84] something bad for them like clay to eat
[859.80 - 863.70] or charcoal or apple cider vinegar
[861.84 - 865.16] gummies or crap like that it's
[863.70 - 867.72] unbelievable
[865.16 - 868.40] it's a sick world it's really A demented
[867.72 - 870.54] World
[868.40 - 873.00] nanoparticles from air fresheners and
[870.54 - 875.22] scented candles have to be gobbled up
[873.00 - 876.96] by your immune cells and that's a
[875.22 - 878.94] problem all on its own your immune cells
[876.96 - 881.82] have to gobble that junk up pathogens
[878.94 - 884.58] such as these bugs right that everyone
[881.82 - 886.02] lives with now people live with all the
[884.58 - 888.00] different bugs inside of them you guys
[886.02 - 891.54] know how that's why everybody gets sick
[888.00 - 892.74] it's a big part of it the pathogens
[891.54 - 895.62] right
[892.74 - 897.54] I've seen Barr virus low-grade viral
[895.62 - 899.46] infections weaken the immune system
[897.54 - 900.96] because your white count has to gobble
[899.46 - 904.74] it all up
[900.96 - 907.98] flu viruses and beep
[904.74 - 910.92] have to be gobbled up
[907.98 - 912.42] flu viruses and bleep have to be gobbled
[910.92 - 914.58] up
[912.42 - 917.22] they have to
[914.58 - 919.02] xic heavy metals that enter your body
[917.22 - 923.12] through all kinds of beep and other
[919.02 - 923.12] things and ways have to be gobbled up
[923.76 - 927.06] and here's another thing people don't
[925.32 - 928.86] realize caffeine
[927.06 - 931.68] caffeine lowers the immune system
[928.86 - 935.16] because it has to be eaten up by white
[931.68 - 937.08] blood cells nobody knows that
[935.16 - 939.48] meanwhile a caffeine industry evolving
[937.08 - 941.76] around us new caffeine concoctions while
[939.48 - 943.08] the caffeine industry evolves around us
[941.76 - 945.00] you guys I'm reading out of brain saver
[943.08 - 947.40] books check it out
[945.00 - 948.60] check them out right here you won't be
[947.40 - 951.66] disappointed when you get the brain
[948.60 - 953.28] saver books books with an S you will be
[951.66 - 955.44] mind blown
[953.28 - 956.52] hands down the greatest books of all
[955.44 - 959.70] time
[956.52 - 962.40] and I'm sure just
[959.70 - 964.02] people are going to be pissed about them
[962.40 - 965.40] along the way
[964.02 - 967.44] so I'm sure there's going to be plenty
[965.40 - 968.82] of campaigns to try to like break down
[967.44 - 970.44] my credibility
[968.82 - 973.44] and then this and then the information
[970.44 - 976.20] here will be stolen over time by podcast
[973.44 - 978.36] doctors or whoever else
[976.20 - 980.16] so
[978.36 - 981.90] but you can't break down street cred
[980.16 - 983.16] millions of people healing around the
[981.90 - 985.14] world and the most healing stories
[983.16 - 987.02] around the world never before in our
[985.14 - 990.00] history
[987.02 - 991.68] and it's is what it is
[990.00 - 992.94] so here's how it works let's go into it
[991.68 - 994.92] a little bit and I got a couple of
[992.94 - 997.68] things I want to do with you guys I want
[994.92 - 1000.98] to help you clean a book because
[997.68 - 1002.06] it's important because the books get
[1000.98 - 1004.72] dirty
[1002.06 - 1006.98] when they get shipped to you from Amazon
[1004.72 - 1010.16] and I'm going to go into that in a
[1006.98 - 1013.76] minute I know we're going off topic
[1010.16 - 1017.96] so here's how it works as a white blood
[1013.76 - 1017.96] cell gobbles up nanoparticles
[1018.08 - 1022.34] whether it's toxic heavy metals air
[1020.18 - 1025.22] fresheners fragrances perfumes colognes
[1022.34 - 1027.68] pathogens radiation EMF when your white
[1025.22 - 1031.90] count is gobbling it up
[1027.68 - 1031.90] it's taking a hit for us
[1032.96 - 1038.54] it's taking a hit and that hit is like a
[1035.84 - 1040.58] stab to the white blood cell it means
[1038.54 - 1042.46] the white blood cell won't last long so
[1040.58 - 1045.80] that's how it goes the more exposure
[1042.46 - 1048.62] exposure doesn't make you stronger I saw
[1045.80 - 1051.32] somebody else take that from
[1048.62 - 1053.90] and then in it's an influencer doctor
[1051.32 - 1055.58] took that fairly recently too
[1053.90 - 1058.06] and everybody's like what I never heard
[1055.58 - 1058.06] that before
[1058.10 - 1064.40] it doesn't make you stronger
[1061.94 - 1066.02] exposures don't make you stronger your
[1064.40 - 1067.52] immune system instead gets beaten down
[1066.02 - 1069.38] and broken down and beaten down and
[1067.52 - 1070.64] broken down and then your brain gets
[1069.38 - 1072.44] exposed
[1070.64 - 1075.26] vulnerable
[1072.44 - 1077.54] so it's supposed to your your white
[1075.26 - 1078.86] blood cells don't last long depending on
[1077.54 - 1082.04] what they're up against as they're
[1078.86 - 1085.58] trying to gobble up nanotechnology
[1082.04 - 1087.74] the white blood cell ceases to live so
[1085.58 - 1089.18] what happens is we walk around and we
[1087.74 - 1090.92] get all these exposures in our white
[1089.18 - 1093.14] blood cells die
[1090.92 - 1095.30] and then new ones have to be created
[1093.14 - 1097.94] it's interesting if you go into the
[1095.30 - 1101.06] brain saver books you'll see an epic
[1097.94 - 1103.82] blood draw chapter
[1101.06 - 1105.08] I recommend highly recommend reading
[1103.82 - 1107.06] that chapter but first of all I'll take
[1105.08 - 1108.50] the book from the beginning and and get
[1107.06 - 1110.30] through it because there's a lot to
[1108.50 - 1111.68] digest in these books both of them
[1110.30 - 1113.90] equally
[1111.68 - 1115.34] but the blood draw chapter I talk a lot
[1113.90 - 1116.78] about what happens when we get our blood
[1115.34 - 1118.64] draw so here we are we're getting sick
[1116.78 - 1120.02] from all these exposures check this out
[1118.64 - 1122.12] you guys we're getting sick from all
[1120.02 - 1123.74] these exposures
[1122.12 - 1125.42] so we're getting our fatigue and our
[1123.74 - 1126.80] diagnoses and our symptoms and our
[1125.42 - 1128.00] neurological problems and our headaches
[1126.80 - 1129.14] and our aches and pains and our
[1128.00 - 1131.48] dizziness or whatever it is we're
[1129.14 - 1133.58] dealing with burning skin trigeminal
[1131.48 - 1135.74] neuralgia back pain feet pain whatever's
[1133.58 - 1137.78] going on in your life
[1135.74 - 1139.22] we're getting sick and then we go to the
[1137.78 - 1141.86] doctors and they're drawing tons of
[1139.22 - 1143.72] blood and they're taking out our immune
[1141.86 - 1145.22] system at the same time the very thing
[1143.72 - 1147.56] that's been eating up all these
[1145.22 - 1149.96] exposures and eating them up trying to
[1147.56 - 1151.46] protect your brain and then we go to the
[1149.96 - 1153.98] doctor's office which I recommend the
[1151.46 - 1155.60] doctor's office of course why not
[1153.98 - 1157.76] she taught you bring the books to your
[1155.60 - 1159.26] doctors but then they take all this
[1157.76 - 1160.94] Blood Out
[1159.26 - 1162.62] because that's not regulated it should
[1160.94 - 1164.12] be regulated how much blood they take
[1162.62 - 1166.04] out and for good reason they don't need
[1164.12 - 1167.54] much to run a blood test and you should
[1166.04 - 1169.70] read that in the blood draw chapter
[1167.54 - 1172.10] section but then the immune system
[1169.70 - 1174.94] lowers even more because we lose our
[1172.10 - 1174.94] white blood count
[1175.04 - 1178.70] when a white blood cell fights a
[1177.50 - 1182.20] pathogen
[1178.70 - 1182.20] the pathogen explodes
[1183.20 - 1190.16] but the white blood cell eventually runs
[1185.54 - 1192.62] out of strength and explodes itself
[1190.16 - 1194.48] the white blood cell can explode with it
[1192.62 - 1196.04] so check this out so we got the
[1194.48 - 1198.80] pathogens inside of us that are white
[1196.04 - 1200.54] counties going after the pathogen the
[1198.80 - 1203.24] white count will eat the white blood
[1200.54 - 1206.30] cell immune cell will eat the pathogen
[1203.24 - 1210.52] until the pathogen is gone
[1206.30 - 1210.52] and then explode itself
[1214.64 - 1219.74] in many situations a white blood cell
[1216.98 - 1221.54] dies when it's killing a pathogen whey
[1219.74 - 1224.18] blood cells are not as easily replaced
[1221.54 - 1226.34] as we think they are
[1224.18 - 1228.62] that's for sure
[1226.34 - 1232.18] they're precious
[1228.62 - 1232.18] they're not easy to replace
[1234.14 - 1238.16] the more white blood cells that die
[1236.18 - 1240.44] quickly due to exposure the bigger the
[1238.16 - 1241.88] gap before newly released ones arrive so
[1240.44 - 1244.22] here's another thing the more exposures
[1241.88 - 1247.76] we have the faster and more white blood
[1244.22 - 1250.10] cells die and the longer duration occurs
[1247.76 - 1253.10] between getting the new immune cells
[1250.10 - 1255.44] from our bone marrow that duration is
[1253.10 - 1256.70] longer and longer and longer and then
[1255.44 - 1258.74] we're at the doctor's office because
[1256.70 - 1262.40] we're sick I don't feel good I got
[1258.74 - 1264.80] fatigued I got ticks and spasms I'm so
[1262.40 - 1266.18] disconnect I have I feel disconnected I
[1264.80 - 1267.68] have depression you're at the doctor's
[1266.18 - 1271.46] office and they're drawing more blood
[1267.68 - 1273.74] now and now you already have a gap
[1271.46 - 1276.08] of immune cells being produced out of
[1273.74 - 1278.42] your bone marrow and then as more
[1276.08 - 1281.06] blood's being drawn the Gap widens even
[1278.42 - 1283.58] more and we get sicker the brain saver
[1281.06 - 1285.50] books are to save people's lives
[1283.58 - 1287.18] the most advanced information to protect
[1285.50 - 1289.58] people that no one knows or talks about
[1287.18 - 1291.86] anywhere no functional doctor no medical
[1289.58 - 1294.14] system no industry no doctor anywhere
[1291.86 - 1296.60] the health care provider talks about
[1294.14 - 1298.28] because they simply don't know this is
[1296.60 - 1300.32] the most advanced information out there
[1298.28 - 1302.12] I want to cover a couple little fun
[1300.32 - 1304.70] things
[1302.12 - 1307.40] so you guys spread this information
[1304.70 - 1308.54] around about cleaning the books and I
[1307.40 - 1311.96] want to talk about this for a second
[1308.54 - 1314.90] when people order the books Amazon has
[1311.96 - 1317.36] greasy conveyor belts so they have
[1314.90 - 1321.08] conveyor belts so when you place your
[1317.36 - 1324.08] order somebody working in Amazon takes
[1321.08 - 1328.22] the book out of the box that's on the
[1324.08 - 1329.12] shelf and they throw it on the conveyor
[1328.22 - 1331.34] belt
[1329.12 - 1334.34] this is what happens at Amazon and other
[1331.34 - 1336.98] stores other other stores online
[1334.34 - 1339.02] the conveyor belt has grease because
[1336.98 - 1341.00] they're greasing the wheels on the
[1339.02 - 1343.10] conveyor belt so they go along the
[1341.00 - 1345.98] conveyor belt with a grease gun
[1343.10 - 1348.50] Greece petrochemicals right and they
[1345.98 - 1351.50] Grease the conveyor belts
[1348.50 - 1353.18] they do it every day every week grease
[1351.50 - 1355.34] just gets everywhere
[1353.18 - 1357.02] the book goes down the conveyor belt
[1355.34 - 1358.94] heading down it's getting ready to be
[1357.02 - 1360.38] packaged or thrown in a box by another
[1358.94 - 1362.18] guy
[1360.38 - 1364.60] and then taped up
[1362.18 - 1368.30] now it's important to know this because
[1364.60 - 1371.96] you'll have grease or some kind of like
[1368.30 - 1374.18] Grime on a brand new book now what often
[1371.96 - 1375.86] happens is someone will see a little bit
[1374.18 - 1377.60] of grease on their book and think they
[1375.86 - 1381.92] don't have a brand new book so they'll
[1377.60 - 1383.72] give medical medium a one star review
[1381.92 - 1388.40] foreign
[1383.72 - 1390.74] which is sad because no one gets it
[1388.40 - 1393.74] but really it's a brand new book there
[1390.74 - 1396.62] are no used medical medium books I mean
[1393.74 - 1398.42] the Publishers prints out all these are
[1396.62 - 1400.82] all brand new books
[1398.42 - 1405.46] so then what you do is you put a tiny
[1400.82 - 1405.46] bit of dish soap on a damp towel
[1406.22 - 1414.98] and you can wipe your books really clean
[1411.56 - 1416.18] and they'll just come out shiny clean I
[1414.98 - 1417.64] want everybody to know this and tell
[1416.18 - 1419.90] other people because you'll see people
[1417.64 - 1422.48] confused once in a while there'll be
[1419.90 - 1424.28] some grease on a book or something like
[1422.48 - 1426.02] that and they'll be like what is that so
[1424.28 - 1428.90] that's one way of doing it and you can
[1426.02 - 1431.60] clean your book up real real nice brand
[1428.90 - 1433.52] new book the other thing is you don't
[1431.60 - 1435.44] see the grease on other books you might
[1433.52 - 1439.70] have ordered in the past because medical
[1435.44 - 1440.96] medium books are like this clean look to
[1439.70 - 1443.00] them
[1440.96 - 1445.28] so all the medical medium books have
[1443.00 - 1447.32] that white behind everything and they're
[1445.28 - 1449.24] really clean so when it goes down the
[1447.32 - 1451.88] Amazon
[1449.24 - 1453.02] conveyor belt and it gets recently you
[1451.88 - 1454.58] don't see grease on all your other
[1453.02 - 1457.30] products that come down Amazon's
[1454.58 - 1457.30] conveyor belt
[1457.58 - 1462.20] so you're gonna see that
[1459.56 - 1464.90] you can use a handy wipe right so here's
[1462.20 - 1467.06] a handy wipe with alcohol
[1464.90 - 1470.00] that's the way I do it too so if I order
[1467.06 - 1471.98] a book for a friend or something do like
[1470.00 - 1475.46] a handy wipe and clean the cover like
[1471.98 - 1477.50] that with the handy wipe
[1475.46 - 1480.20] that's another way to get them really
[1477.50 - 1483.08] nice and clean
[1480.20 - 1485.24] that's great right there so
[1483.08 - 1487.58] which is really which is really great
[1485.24 - 1489.74] okay so another thing to just run by you
[1487.58 - 1492.62] guys if you guys have a minute is the
[1489.74 - 1495.26] smell of the books
[1492.62 - 1498.28] so what's really incredible about the
[1495.26 - 1498.28] medical medium book series
[1498.56 - 1503.18] it's stored in a warehouse that has no
[1500.54 - 1507.14] plug-in air fresheners
[1503.18 - 1510.74] they're stored in a warehouse that has
[1507.14 - 1512.50] no perfumes colognes plug-in air
[1510.74 - 1514.28] fresheners
[1512.50 - 1516.32] pesticides
[1514.28 - 1519.26] fungicides
[1516.32 - 1521.62] that all the other books are stored at
[1519.26 - 1521.62] places
[1521.66 - 1526.28] so what's really awesome my publisher
[1523.94 - 1528.62] promises me that the warehouse is that
[1526.28 - 1532.22] the medical medium books are stored in
[1528.62 - 1534.62] after they're printed doesn't have any
[1532.22 - 1536.32] of that chemical stuff I want people to
[1534.62 - 1539.96] know this if you can tell other people
[1536.32 - 1542.18] this is really an incredible thing
[1539.96 - 1544.58] like really incredible
[1542.18 - 1546.68] when I even think about it so I want
[1544.58 - 1549.80] people to know how it works like this is
[1546.68 - 1552.82] inside info on what we do to make sure
[1549.80 - 1557.06] that your books
[1552.82 - 1559.64] don't come saturate it in perfumes
[1557.06 - 1561.14] clones scented candles now what happens
[1559.64 - 1565.52] is
[1561.14 - 1567.38] that my publisher is doing me a favor by
[1565.52 - 1569.42] making sure the medical medium books
[1567.38 - 1571.28] don't get stored in warehouses that have
[1569.42 - 1573.74] all the scented candles
[1571.28 - 1575.96] and detergents and other weird stuff and
[1573.74 - 1578.00] all that so it's important to know but
[1575.96 - 1581.24] here's the problem if you get a book
[1578.00 - 1585.14] that seems like there's some smell to it
[1581.24 - 1587.54] it's only because of where it went after
[1585.14 - 1589.58] it was printed and stored at the
[1587.54 - 1592.04] original Warehouse it has no smells and
[1589.58 - 1593.84] sense that means that if it went to a
[1592.04 - 1595.70] bookstore and the bookstore has a lot of
[1593.84 - 1597.74] scented candles in the bookstore too and
[1595.70 - 1599.36] you order the book online and the book
[1597.74 - 1601.40] gets packaged up you might have a
[1599.36 - 1603.14] scented candle smell on a book and then
[1601.40 - 1607.64] you just give it time and just let it
[1603.14 - 1610.34] air out another thing too is
[1607.64 - 1612.38] the same thing with Amazon warehouses I
[1610.34 - 1614.90] have no control over Amazon warehouses
[1612.38 - 1616.76] and all the scented candle smells and
[1614.90 - 1618.14] all the plug-in smells and everything
[1616.76 - 1619.88] else same thing with all bookstore
[1618.14 - 1621.98] warehouses I have no control over that
[1619.88 - 1623.90] so if you do get one book that happens
[1621.98 - 1626.54] to have a smell of
[1623.90 - 1629.18] something perfume
[1626.54 - 1630.68] then just know that over time that will
[1629.18 - 1633.80] air out
[1630.68 - 1635.36] and it's not the original Source like it
[1633.80 - 1637.16] wasn't the medical medium books or the
[1635.36 - 1638.72] medical medium books being printed this
[1637.16 - 1640.88] is so important to know because some
[1638.72 - 1642.68] people might get a book they order from
[1640.88 - 1644.00] Amazon at a different Amazon warehouse
[1642.68 - 1646.82] that happen to have plug-in air
[1644.00 - 1648.92] fresheners or some kind of chemical or
[1646.82 - 1650.60] they ordered it from a bookstore line or
[1648.92 - 1652.40] walked into a bookstore and the
[1650.60 - 1654.26] bookstore has scented candles in one
[1652.40 - 1658.22] corner so everybody can have that
[1654.26 - 1660.50] experience or whatever or and if there
[1658.22 - 1662.96] is a smell know that it comes from way
[1660.50 - 1664.82] after the fact from wherever you're
[1662.96 - 1668.56] getting the book from but the original
[1664.82 - 1673.64] place the book was printed and stored
[1668.56 - 1675.44] was chemical free as far as no chemicals
[1673.64 - 1677.96] that were in the warehouse floating
[1675.44 - 1679.94] around no plugins no perfumes no clones
[1677.96 - 1682.34] no anything like this and this was done
[1679.94 - 1685.12] on purpose so that the medical medium
[1682.34 - 1688.88] book line in the book series
[1685.12 - 1691.52] really has the Purity factor to it which
[1688.88 - 1693.50] leads me to another thing all on its own
[1691.52 - 1696.32] the books
[1693.50 - 1697.94] they're of the light you feel it you
[1696.32 - 1700.64] know it when you read it you know it
[1697.94 - 1703.28] when you hold it
[1700.64 - 1705.80] not only are the these brain saver books
[1703.28 - 1708.86] the greatest books of all time but you
[1705.80 - 1710.72] feel that energy in these books you feel
[1708.86 - 1713.96] the life you feel that it's not dead
[1710.72 - 1716.90] material and books have dead words
[1713.96 - 1719.78] they're just dead words on a page and
[1716.90 - 1723.26] then these books they're not dead words
[1719.78 - 1725.54] on a page books are living words and you
[1723.26 - 1728.06] feel that energy and you know it's there
[1725.54 - 1730.40] and when you read the material and
[1728.06 - 1733.10] understand it and learn you'll be mind
[1730.40 - 1735.02] blown and when you apply the
[1733.10 - 1736.28] recommendations in these books you will
[1735.02 - 1739.40] feel it
[1736.28 - 1742.58] and that doesn't exist anywhere else and
[1739.40 - 1744.20] so that's a whole thing on its own
[1742.58 - 1746.00] so you guys we talked about the immune
[1744.20 - 1748.46] system how the brain relies on the
[1746.00 - 1750.86] immune system how important
[1748.46 - 1752.78] that is for the brain
[1750.86 - 1755.72] and I only just read a couple of
[1752.78 - 1757.76] paragraphs that's all it was which is
[1755.72 - 1760.64] really when you think about only reading
[1757.76 - 1763.64] a couple of paragraphs I mean when I
[1760.64 - 1764.90] think about that it blows my mind it
[1763.64 - 1767.12] just does
[1764.90 - 1769.40] and when I think about just a couple of
[1767.12 - 1771.44] paragraphs versus how much which is in
[1769.40 - 1771.98] here
[1771.44 - 1774.02] um
[1771.98 - 1776.24] anyway I have somebody here with me I
[1774.02 - 1780.44] have a guest I have a
[1776.24 - 1784.40] a world renowned doctor who's
[1780.44 - 1786.44] um coming in here so I hope you guys
[1784.40 - 1788.48] you know I want you to see both books if
[1786.44 - 1789.86] you're interested in both books so I got
[1788.48 - 1791.54] a worldwide
[1789.86 - 1793.88] famous
[1791.54 - 1795.02] surgeon and psychiatrist who wants to
[1793.88 - 1797.24] say hi
[1795.02 - 1799.94] we weren't friends for a little while we
[1797.24 - 1800.96] had a falling out and I was really upset
[1799.94 - 1802.94] about it
[1800.96 - 1805.16] and he was too
[1802.94 - 1807.14] but we had a falling out because of the
[1805.16 - 1809.12] alcohol problem he has even though he's
[1807.14 - 1811.46] still a great surgeon I recommend his
[1809.12 - 1812.12] surgeries to anyone
[1811.46 - 1814.70] um
[1812.12 - 1816.56] anyway are you gonna say hi to everybody
[1814.70 - 1819.92] are you shy
[1816.56 - 1821.24] Dr Nesbit says he's kind of shy but he
[1819.92 - 1825.38] just wants to
[1821.24 - 1827.18] see how everybody is for a second here
[1825.38 - 1830.06] I hope no one's canceling their book
[1827.18 - 1833.38] orders because of you Dr Nesbit I hope
[1830.06 - 1833.38] nobody cancels your order
[1833.66 - 1838.34] he says he doesn't care that's not a
[1835.88 - 1841.16] nice thing to say
[1838.34 - 1843.20] s he's kidding all right that's good he
[1841.16 - 1846.62] says he's just joking around so Dr
[1843.20 - 1851.06] Nesbitt has been off the alcohol for two
[1846.62 - 1855.98] weeks now he's sober he only had one
[1851.06 - 1858.08] surgical mistake last week he removed
[1855.98 - 1860.72] um he removed
[1858.08 - 1862.46] someone's
[1860.72 - 1864.32] he was supposed to remove their
[1862.46 - 1866.06] gallbladder but he removed their liver
[1864.32 - 1868.82] instead and they tried to put the liver
[1866.06 - 1872.06] back in the patient and
[1868.82 - 1874.10] that's what insurance is for okay
[1872.06 - 1876.08] it just didn't work out
[1874.10 - 1877.76] patient's alive though
[1876.08 - 1879.14] they're just walking around without a
[1877.76 - 1880.16] liver
[1879.14 - 1882.56] really
[1880.16 - 1883.52] anyway so Dr nesbitt's just saying hi to
