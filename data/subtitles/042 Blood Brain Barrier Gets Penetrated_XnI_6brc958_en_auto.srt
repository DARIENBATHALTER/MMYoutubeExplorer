1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,680
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:10,200
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,520
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,359
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,840
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,200
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,480
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,600
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,160
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,199
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,399
Williams we're talking about the bloodb

15
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,120
brain barrier the bloodb brain barrier

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,039
has limitations and vulnerabilities it's

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,480
only Geared for the small stuff not the

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,239
big stuff the small stuff not all the

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,000
poison and toxins environmental waste

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,680
and so much that we're up against every

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,320
day our human body is not geared for the

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,479
levels of exposure we experience on this

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,759
planet a bloodb brain barrier never

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,439
anticipated the Industrial Revolution

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,079
and the classified medical industry

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,079
where pathogens dominate the

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,799
revolution convincing us that our bloodb

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,560
brain barrier can handle anything

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,520
convincing us that our human body is

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,040
equipped to handle anything is basically

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
saying our human body is equipped to

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,520
handle nuclear waste we're told in many

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,079
ways that we created here on the planet

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,360
so we should be able to handle it we

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,040
created it we should be able to handle

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,320
it our bloodb brain barrier should have

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,600
no problem no problem at all protecting

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,920
us against anything protect us against

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
nuclear waste right or any kind of toxic

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,640
material

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:14,080
right Max

42
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:17,319
Max put put the toxic barrels over there

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,160
put the toxic barrels over there oh oh

44
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,480
oh you spilled it you spilled it don't

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,120
worry don't worry your bloodb brain

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,959
barriers got you

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,080
covered yeah yeah you don't need to

48
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,040
shower that off just get back to work

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
but our bloodb brain barriers take care

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,640
of all that toxic

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,280
waste no one I repeat no one is

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,159
measuring the levels of toxins in our

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,599
environment no one I know everybody

54
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,840
thinks there is somebody I know

55
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,519
everybody thinks there's an agency I

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,400
know everybody thinks there's some kind

57
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,519
of scientific body that it's all taken

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,879
care of that's what we're taught we're

59
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,480
taught that in

60
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:03,040
school everybody's taught that that in

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640
college they're taught that at

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,760
universities they're taught that in high

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,239
schools they're taught that there's

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,879
this Universal knowledge or knowing that

65
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,760
everything's taken care of that

66
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,920
everything's okay with the environment

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,560
because

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,000
surely

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,799
surely no one wants to destroy the

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,840
planet that we live on I mean

71
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,920
surely but that's the problem nobody's

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,360
really watching nobody's keeping keeping

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,599
an eye on it and then there's the whole

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,519
climate change thing climate change well

75
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,840
that means in some way that somebody's

76
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,560
watching over the planet right like all

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,720
the pollution and the toxins and

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,519
environmental waste it's all covered

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,120
under climate change so if everybody's

80
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,280
so worried about climate change then

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,959
everybody must be monitoring some way

82
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,400
somehow the destruction of the planet

83
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,799
there has to be some science behind that

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,200
there there has to be some body of

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,000
government or body of science that's

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,000
actually keeping an eye on all of this

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,519
but that's where it's misleading there

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,599
isn't on another note did you ever think

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
about the whole global warming thing

90
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,799
remember that's where it started it was

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,519
global warming science was saying global

92
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,400
warming we were taught in school that it

93
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,560
was global warming but what happened to

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,759
global warming the Earth isn't heating

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,600
up anymore it's not warming up anymore

96
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,919
we were taught and told that it was

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Ironclad solid to the

98
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,880
core set in stone that it was global

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
warming and suddenly it all changed

100
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,120
that's it now it's climate change that

101
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,960
means whatever happens it just falls

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,720
under climate change but global warming

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,080
don't even say that word anymore you

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,600
don't get laughed at you got to just

105
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,280
kind of like never even remember that

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,240
phrase because science was

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,120
wrong that's why and now climate change

108
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,479
science is right but what about 10 years

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,919
from now is science going to be wrong

110
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,240
again because science isn't really right

111
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,880
about anything because I'll tell you

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,520
right now when it comes down to this

113
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,560
nobody's really looking no one's

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,199
monitoring it's just a bunch of Talking

115
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,759
Heads that's what it is now it's not

116
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,720
real science behind something actually

117
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,600
trying to figure something out because

118
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,520
no real science is watching over truly

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,000
the toxic waste on this planet and the

120
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,000
levels of the toxic waste they're not

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,120
watching the

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,240
Chemtrails as they're just falling down

123
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,400
they're not monitoring or testing what

124
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,319
the planes are releasing in the sky that

125
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,880
are being dumped in our lakes rivers on

126
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,960
our fields on our grass on our Lawns on

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,479
our heads none of that is being

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,880
monitored it's just

129
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,360
Phantom I was always told by my source

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,400
since I was younger that it's global

131
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,080
cooling planets cooling down little bit

132
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,400
at a time but cooling down one of the

133
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,080
reasons is from the Chemtrails alone

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,479
clouding up the sky blocking the

135
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Sun that part alone is cooling down the

136
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,039
planet never mind other forms of toxic

137
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,400
waste what about planet Mars planet Mars

138
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,240
is

139
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,240
freezing temperatures drop it gets real

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,960
cold yeah because there was toxic waste

141
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,720
on that planet through

142
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Wars that planet self-

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,080
imploded basically lots of Wars lots of

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,560
Destruction planet was

145
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,000
annihilated toxins everywhere in the

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,840
atmosphere and it just

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,759
died absolutely just stopped and ceased

148
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,759
and died Mars is dead Planet just

149
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,680
starting to probably come back and

150
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,479
spring back to life in some way after a

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
very long period of time it's also a

152
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,479
chil planet there might be some warm

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,440
spots at different times just warm

154
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,879
enough but it gets cold and the

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,400
temperature drops after we destroy this

156
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,479
planet at some

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,319
point same thing's going to happen but

158
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,520
what does it matter the bloodb brain

159
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
barrier takes care of everything it

160
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,479
stops everything from getting into our

161
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,080
brain it protects us everything's okay

162
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,039
hey hey you heard it out there don't

163
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,960
worry it has to cross the bloodb brain

164
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,680
barrier nothing can cross the bloodb

165
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,919
brain barrier right that's what we're

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,440
told so what does it all matter medical

167
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,520
research and science medical

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,400
Industries don't want to admit there are

169
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,520
toxic heavy metals in everybody's brains

170
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,360
they don't even want to entertain the

171
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,840
idea and publicly known medical research

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,960
and science they're in the infancy

173
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,400
stages of just recognizing izing

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,120
pathogens being responsible for chronic

175
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,400
illness if they're that early in

176
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,599
understanding chronic illness if they're

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,199
at the beginning process of

178
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,960
understanding pathogens being

179
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,360
responsible for chronic illness barely

180
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,000
at the beginning process then how

181
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,720
advanced can they possibly be

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,039
understanding our body's complexities or

183
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,599
mechanisms such as the bloodb brain

184
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,960
barrier our bloodb brain barrier was not

185
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,240
meant to handle any of this we act like

186
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,760
it's this impermeable substance this

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,240
impermeable structure this wall that

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,080
stops things that it has no limitations

189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
we're taught that no don't worry about

190
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,360
it blood brain barriers got it all

191
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,279
covered it can't get through there

192
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,000
nuclear waste Industrial Waste solvents

193
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,640
yeah solvents you're exposed to solvents

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,440
every day and don't even know it toxic

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,680
heavy metals all someone has to do is

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,760
use the term bloodb brain barrier to

197
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,519
make us feel feel like we're all warm

198
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,800
and fuzzy and protected nothing could be

199
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,600
wrong don't worry about that you got a

200
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,320
bloodb brain barrier and yet the reality

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,880
all these things and more passes through

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,720
the bloodb brain barrier pharmaceutical

203
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,000
companies big Pharma they design drugs

204
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,839
to pass through your bloodb brain

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,279
barrier they try really hard to do it

206
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,640
funny thing is the drugs that they don't

207
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
believe pass through the bloodb brain

208
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,560
barrier still pass through the bloodb

209
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,480
brain barrier so what is our blood brain

210
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,760
barrier for what was our blood brain

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,360
barrier originally designed for well

212
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,959
I'll tell you to keep natural mostly

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,160
bodily toxins out of the brain like when

214
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,680
someone has a little too much uric acid

215
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,600
in their system because they have a weak

216
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,959
kidney issue if you have a weak kidney

217
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,279
or kidney disease your uric acid's

218
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,680
building up in your

219
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,240
bloodstream that is not supposed to

220
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,440
cross the bloodb brain barrier it's a

221
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,839
natural phenomenon a natural process

222
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,920
it's a natural bodily function fluid

223
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,920
it's a toxin our body is dealing with

224
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
naturally we have a kidney problem we

225
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,600
have uric acid built up in the

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,279
bloodstream it's not supposed to cross

227
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,440
the blood brain barrier if someone gets

228
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:27,240
a cut and it goes too deep and there's

229
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,480
an infection developing and even sepsis

230
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,839
could be possible from a blood infection

231
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,240
developing from that deep cut that

232
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,079
infection is not supposed to cross the

233
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,360
bloodb brain barrier that's what it's

234
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,560
for and get ready for this one if

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,839
someone ingests a toxic plant that's

236
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,920
been on planet Earth for 10,000 years

237
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,040
and grown naturally on the earth and was

238
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,120
never meant to be human food the bloodb

239
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,680
brain barrier is there to hold back at

240
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,120
least some of the toxins in an effort to

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,320
prevent the brain from going into toxic

242
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,720
shock and still toxic chemical compounds

243
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,600
from that plant will still cross the

244
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,959
bloodb brain barrier but some will stay

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,800
behind our cerebral spinal fluid which

246
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:23,720
surrounds our brain and spinal cord is

247
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,360
supposed to be pure the good stuff it's

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,480
supposed to be

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,800
uncontaminated it's supposed to be clean

250
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,120
that's the goal gold standard in this

251
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,040
time on planet Earth our cerebral spinal

252
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,399
fluid is not pure though it's not the

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,760
gold standard it's supposed to be but

254
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,440
it's not it's harboring chemical soups

255
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,720
from industry pathogenic byproducts

256
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,760
toxic heavy metals and a crap ton more a

257
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,079
thousand years ago our cereal spinal

258
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,279
fluid may have just had some toxic heavy

259
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,959
metals in it but that's about it from

260
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,760
drinking water water in the cities from

261
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,920
lead pipes there wasn't any Industrial

262
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,480
Revolution plants all around the planet

263
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,560
spewing out Mercury and toxins and all

264
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,120
kinds of other poisons it didn't exist

265
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,920
it was just some lead from drinking

266
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,279
water and the occasional drinking of

267
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,199
mercury Elixir thinking it might give

268
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,440
you longevity or heal a chronic illness

269
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,399
today we walk around

270
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,440
polluted the blood brain barrier

271
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,199
has

272
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,440
limitations if an industry creates a

273
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,519
battery and then that battery sits in

274
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,120
the car and it corrodes and someone

275
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,440
actually tries to change that battery

276
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,680
and there's battery AET that appears on

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,560
the battery and then gets consumed

278
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,240
accidentally it's going across the

279
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,399
bloodb brain barrier if a child gets a

280
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,480
hold of a little battery and start to

281
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,040
chew on it and the acid leaks and burns

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,680
the child's throat it's not just just

283
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,199
the burn on the child's throat causes a

284
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,000
lot of problems it's the acid crossing

285
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:11,000
the bloodb brain barrier industrial

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,360
toxins and mercury and other toxic heavy

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,199
metals are going to enter the brain

288
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
they're going to cross the blood brain

289
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,000
barrier when we think about the blood

290
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,600
brain barrier we hear it or we talk

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,760
about it it seems so strong in our minds

292
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,000
it's like a barrier we hear the word

293
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,560
barrier you look up that word barrier

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,800
it's serious it means like a wall it

295
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,600
means something blocking or

296
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,600
protecting barrier but really it's

297
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,600
really not like that at all it's a thin

298
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,240
construction it acts as a type of thin

299
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,720
filtering wall of tissue it's tissue

300
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,480
it's not this incredible wall built out

301
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,600
of stone and

302
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,519
rock the bloodb brain barrier is not

303
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,480
even as strong as your skin your skin on

304
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,399
your face skin on your arm it's way

305
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,040
weaker way thinner than any of that if

306
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,240
you slap on some cologne or perfume

307
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,000
right on your skin it's going to go

308
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
right through your skin absorb through

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,079
all the layers and enter your

310
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,360
bloodstream the bloodb brain barrier

311
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,720
worse goes through it like it wasn't

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,199
even there and when that cologne enters

313
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,920
your bloodstream just breathing it in or

314
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,120
enters it through the skin it heads up

315
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,160
and crosses the bloodb brain

316
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,920
barrier there are many Pharmaceuticals

317
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,440
designed to pass through your bloodb

318
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,480
brain barrier morphine is one of them

319
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,560
it's one of the reasons why morphine can

320
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,800
kill you so easily it can cross through

321
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,320
blood vessels of the brain and spinal

322
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,440
fluid vessels fast remember this all

323
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,199
Pharmaceuticals have toxic heavy metals

324
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,959
in them so engineering Pharmaceuticals

325
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,680
to cross the blood brain barrier means

326
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,040
the toxic heavy metals in those

327
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,880
Pharmaceuticals also cross through the

328
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,160
bloodb brain barrier whether it's

329
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,519
Platinum titanium copper Mercury

330
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,880
aluminum were exposed via pharmaceutical

331
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,040
pills creams and liquids and more and it

332
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,360
all crosses the bloodb brain

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,199
barrier and what about all the oxidation

334
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,560
people having toxic heavy metals in

335
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,399
their organs their livers you know

336
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,519
medical medium information that got out

337
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,839
there all these years how metals are in

338
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,720
our organs and they're

339
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:39,079
oxidizing as they're oxidizing they're

340
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,040
leeching and that runoff which is the

341
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,040
oxidation coming off those Metals

342
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,319
travels through the body well that

343
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,800
runoff that oxidation can also travel

344
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:54,880
and cross the bloodb brain barrier

345
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:59,079
too science of research medical science

346
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,880
doctors none no one knew that the toxic

347
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,079
heavy metals stored in small amounts

348
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,279
throughout all the organs of the body

349
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,800
and that a blood test

350
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,560
taken doesn't catch that doesn't see

351
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,839
that so when you get your blood drawn

352
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,319
and they're looking for toxic heavy

353
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,959
metals in there and they're really low

354
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,880
you could still have a high amount of

355
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,000
toxic heavy metals in your brain your

356
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,519
liver your pancreas your spleen medical

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,880
research and science did not know that

358
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,360
they thought the blood test determined

359
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,839
how many metals you had in your body and

360
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,240
then the teachings of medical medium

361
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,759
information getting out there for

362
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,319
decades and the publishing of the books

363
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,199
has changed

364
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:43,199
everything now you'll see today when you

365
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,639
get a blood test a lot of blood labs are

366
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,759
actually putting a little disclaimer on

367
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,680
the document on the test saying we're

368
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,839
only seeing what we see in the blood but

369
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,839
you could have it in the organs and

370
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
tissue and the crazy thing is I can't

371
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,639
tell you how many people have battled

372
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
how many profess Professionals in health

373
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,920
throughout the years when I said look

374
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,079
the blood test doesn't show everything

375
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,039
with toxic heavy metals it could be

376
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,319
anywhere in your tissue your organs your

377
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,160
brain and the blood test doesn't

378
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,640
determine it same thing with hair

379
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,679
analysis I battled so many different

380
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,919
professionals on this and now the blood

381
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,400
Labs put it on their documents as

382
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,720
they're handing the documents out to

383
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,919
people their tests meanwhile science

384
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
hasn't studied or tested any of it where

385
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,919
did they get the information they didn't

386
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,760
do a study

387
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,440
they can't measure it they've never done

388
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,640
a study measuring it they're not

389
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,520
biopsying people they're not actually

390
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
sticking needles in people's tissue and

391
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,360
saying well your blood test says this

392
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,120
but we're actually doing biopsies on

393
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,240
your brain and your tissue and your

394
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,919
liver and your organs and your pancreas

395
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
and we're looking woo you got some heavy

396
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,679
metals in there still but the blood test

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,600
says you don't have any they're not

398
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,120
doing that at all where did they get it

399
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,919
it came out of thin air well I know

400
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,520
where it came from there's no study

401
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,679
behind it and there's no science behind

402
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,840
it it's a shame they don't site The

403
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,720
Source other things pass through the

404
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,000
blood brain barrier viruses and viral

405
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,679
toxins now viruses are small all in its

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,840
own can you imagine a neurotoxin coming

407
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,640
from a virus just think about how small

408
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,080
that really is a neurotoxin it goes

409
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,440
right through the blood brain barrier

410
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,840
fast and easy and neurotoxins coming

411
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,880
from viruses well that's medical meme

412
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,960
information as well

413
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,480
one of the reasons publicly known

414
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
medical research and science doesn't

415
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,640
even identify

416
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,640
neurotoxins is because they're so small

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,120
when neurotoxins are excreted from the

418
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Epstein bar virus shingles virus hhv6

419
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,720
hhv7 simplex 1 Simplex 2 and so many

420
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,640
other viruses when they're

421
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,000
excreted they are excreted in a liquid

422
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,960
form and then that liquid slips right

423
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,799
through the blood brain

424
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,080
barrier if classified medical research

425
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:08,360
and science ever discovered neurotoxins

426
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,039
being released from viruses and they

427
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,600
told publicly known medical research and

428
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,320
science about it then science would be

429
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,159
completely halted on it publicly known

430
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,360
medical research and science would not

431
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:25,919
be allowed to do any more research on

432
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,400
neurotoxins involving viruses at all the

433
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,640
reason because it would lead to the disc

434
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,760
discovery that viruses actually eat and

435
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,280
go to bathroom and this information

436
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,159
about viruses releasing neurotoxins

437
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,159
would compromise the gene Theory where

438
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,120
medical science is trying to convince

439
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,240
everybody on the planet they're sick

440
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,760
because of their

441
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,799
genes there are certain varieties of

442
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,080
Epstein bar that can cross through the

443
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,159
bloodb brain barrier and there are

444
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,080
varieties that can't cross through the

445
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,080
bloodb brain barrier but their

446
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,600
neurotoxins still can either way way

447
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,280
that's what gilon Beret syndrome is

448
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,000
pathogens and pathogenic toxins and

449
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,440
waste Crossing through the bloodb brain

450
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,080
barrier the pathogens that can cross the

451
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,200
bloodb brain barrier do so by latching

452
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,799
onto the barrier itself and inflaming it

453
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,000
all the way through they slowly do

454
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,280
tissue damage to the barrier so the

455
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,200
pathogens can enter and cross eventually

456
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,720
permeating it and leaving microscopic

457
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,440
thick barrier

458
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:38,120
scars keep all of this in mind as easy

459
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,799
as it is to convince us that our blood

460
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,080
brain barrier is an impermeable presence

461
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,840
that makes us impenetrable to the

462
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,280
dangers that Industries release into our

463
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,559
world all we have to do is look around

464
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,120
us at the suffering on this planet to be

465
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,000
reminded that this doesn't add up if we

466
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,799
we want to save ourselves we can't take

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,080
advantage of our body's protective

468
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,400
mechanisms we can't take our bloodb

469
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,760
brain barrier for granted but we do we

470
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,159
have to protect our brain and body we

471
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,919
have to bring every chance we can to our

472
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,080
brain to protect it and that starts with

473
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,760
bringing awareness to the Daily

474
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,960

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,279
betrayed by industrial chemicals and

above medical medium and information has

518

their lives back and finally healing

526
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,000
when nothing else in the world of Health

527
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,080
could move the needle and get them

528
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,600
better the information on this podcast

533
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,679
at all that we're just floating through

534
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,520

the information you hear on this podcast

536
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,279
is separate from all the other noise out

537
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,200
