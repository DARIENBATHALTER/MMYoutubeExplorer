to all the brain shots you can pick the

348
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,760
ones you can find ingredients for from

349
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,040
the book or challenge that you're going

350
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,440
to be doing each day with us

351
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,660
as you're doing it along with us Emily

352
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,320
says so much validation in these books

353
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,779
I mean right these books a lot of

354
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,880
information you take it a little bit at

355
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,160
a time PK I know it's pretty funny to

356
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,699
get a little bit at a time because

357
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,360
there's so much each line is powerful

358
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:48,300
each line has information in it that is

359
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
life-changing that you want in your

360
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,660
consciousness

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,639
question which juicer is the best

362
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,459
there's three on the Omega website okay

363
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,800
what to choose for mm-1500

364
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,760
I work with Omega on two of their

365
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,459
juicers mm-1500 that one right there

366
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,699
mm-900 those are the two that I love the

367
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,920
reason why just hear me out because you

368
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,380
save money when you're juicing and I

369
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,339
don't see that with other juicers I just

370
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,500
don't

371
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,839
I've used them all out there I've tried

372
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,060
every one for the most incredible ones

373
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,680

374
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,399
ones I've tried them all

375
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,040
and all they do is throw away money and

376
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,420
what happens is that the the mm-1500 the

377
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,760
mm-900

378
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,800
they're built so that you actually

379
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,480
squeeze more juice out of it so it's

380
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,980

pass the brain shots through a strainer

397
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,120
same as with CJ

398
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,100
you can't you know look you can pass it

399
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,699
through a strainer you can kind of rub

400
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,079
it through a strainer that's fine if you

401
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,699
don't have a strainer and you can't use

402
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,560
a strainer you can you can try it

403
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,300
without the strainer but I like the

404
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,740
strainer and you kind of just you know

405
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,240
shake it through or rub it through

406
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,339
