[548.40 - 552.48] all the time lemon balm love danielle
[550.72 - 554.24] says you just want the attention that's
[552.48 - 555.60] another one i've heard over and over
[554.24 - 558.32] again
[555.60 - 559.28] i know michelle l says try harder

[569.44 - 573.52] one guanalupe says i love the juicer too
[571.84 - 576.48] you know and that's the thing that's the
[573.52 - 578.80] challenge right and that that you know
[576.48 - 580.88] that takes the person who's suffering
[578.80 - 583.12] and struggling it takes them spiritually
[580.88 - 585.28] so much further though than anybody else
[583.12 - 586.96] because you spiritually grow because not
[585.28 - 588.40] only are you struggling with what you're
[586.96 - 589.60] up against
[588.40 - 590.40] physically

[605.04 - 611.60] either and that's a whole nother level
[607.84 - 613.92] of it all doctors don't believe
[611.60 - 616.32] anyone either when they're struggling
[613.92 - 620.16] and suffering and you can't identify it
[616.32 - 622.56] like you can't like you can't see it
[620.16 - 626.72] but the new age is taking it to a new
[622.56 - 626.72] level because you've created it
[628.56 - 632.56] i want to be sick i want to be bedridden
[630.80 - 635.52] i want to be on mattress island i'm
[632.56 - 637.68] creating it i must be using my thoughts
[635.52 - 639.84] to take myself down that's one part of
[637.68 - 641.68] the new age that you know focuses on
[639.84 - 644.40] that you see it everywhere out there
[641.68 - 647.84] lacey says my counselor said to fake it
[644.40 - 647.84] till i make it
[648.24 - 651.76] you know i think
[649.92 - 653.68] and it's not funny but that's actually
[651.76 - 655.84] that's actually a good one because i
[653.68 - 656.96] don't think i've heard that one
[655.84 - 659.92] i don't
[656.96 - 662.96] ken says i was down but i'm better than
[659.92 - 665.04] ever after doing celery juice thank god

[665.04 - 669.60] found the celery juice
[666.88 - 671.60] thank god you're doing you're doing that
[669.60 - 672.40] thank god you're taking care of yourself
[671.60 - 674.48] right
[672.40 - 675.76] and you found the information
[674.48 - 678.24] okay

[688.16 - 693.92] people with that are struggling
[690.72 - 697.36] with chronic illness
[693.92 - 699.44] they don't get the attention everybody
[697.36 - 702.64] thinks they get
[699.44 - 704.72] even the young people i can't tell you
[702.64 - 706.80] how many moms and dads i've talked to
[704.72 - 709.76] over the years because doctors would be
[706.80 - 712.16] like look um the parents they have sick
[709.76 - 714.32] kids i need advice so i talk to the
[712.16 - 716.16] doctor and say here here here's you know
[714.32 - 719.52] this is this is what what i think can
[716.16 - 720.88] help you to help your patients and
[719.52 - 723.92] and it would be the same thing over and
[720.88 - 726.72] over again where even young people
[723.92 - 729.60] it gets kind of canceled out because
[726.72 - 731.68] it's like is it the boy who cried wolf
[729.60 - 733.04] is that what it is is this the boy who
[731.68 - 735.60] cried wolf
[733.04 - 738.00] and they start getting numb to it so
[735.60 - 738.72] everybody around everybody gets numb to
[738.00 - 740.48] it
[738.72 - 742.48] young adults the same thing it's like
[740.48 - 744.00] the parents if they're lucky enough to
[742.48 - 746.24] have you know parents that are
[744.00 - 748.40] supportive and all that right then all
[746.24 - 751.04] of a sudden it's like um
[748.40 - 753.36] yeah we don't know what's wrong with you
[751.04 - 755.60] you've been to a lot of doctors already
[753.36 - 758.48] you say you have this anxiety condition
[755.60 - 760.40] you say you have fatigue but is it
[758.48 - 762.24] really what it is honey like is it
[760.40 - 764.32] really what it is
[762.24 - 766.72] and everybody gets doubted it so the
[764.32 - 768.24] chronic illness thing game is like
[766.72 - 771.20] everybody gets down and alicia says
[768.24 - 772.48] women always told they're faking it for
[771.20 - 774.48] centuries now
[772.48 - 777.76] just get called crazy
[774.48 - 779.92] alicia yeah crazy lazy you're making it
[777.76 - 782.96] up you're creating it so one of the
[779.92 - 785.68] hardest parts i have with this
[782.96 - 788.00] is first of all i know you're not faking
[785.68 - 790.16] it i know you're not making it up i know
[788.00 - 792.96] you're not creating it
[790.16 - 794.72] i know you're not creating it
[792.96 - 797.52] it's not like you're sitting there
[794.72 - 800.00] creating it like i'm working on creating
[797.52 - 802.08] this right here i'm gonna make sure that
[800.00 - 804.24] i get really sick there's no question
[802.08 - 805.36] i'm going to make sure i get really sick
[804.24 - 807.20] that's what i'm going to do and you know
[805.36 - 808.00] you're not creating it that's not it at
[807.20 - 809.60] all
[808.00 - 812.48] and it's critical to know this this is
[809.60 - 815.36] an important live use to talk about this
[812.48 - 817.92] you know m von doom says i've come to
[815.36 - 819.36] value the people who believe my symptoms
[817.92 - 820.24] so much
[819.36 - 822.16] yeah
[820.24 - 823.76] it's important it's important you have
[822.16 - 826.32] somebody that believes what's going on
[823.76 - 827.76] yup each other what the heck
[826.32 - 830.16] you heard it out of the horse's mouth
[827.76 - 830.16] tonight
[830.64 - 834.56] what the heck
[832.32 - 836.00] okay
[834.56 - 838.96] it's just fun
[836.00 - 840.64] but look the bottom line is you guys
[838.96 - 844.00] you're not making it up
[840.64 - 845.92] you don't have a fear of healing
[844.00 - 846.96] i know
[845.92 - 850.16] you don't
[846.96 - 852.08] have a fear of healing andrea says we
[850.16 - 853.76] prefer attention more than our health
[852.08 - 856.16] yeah right like that's that's what you
[853.76 - 857.92] want exactly you prefer just getting
[856.16 - 860.24] attention been being forced to lay in
[857.92 - 862.00] bed because your condition's keeping you
[860.24 - 863.52] on the couch it's keeping you in bed
[862.00 - 865.12] you're on a mattress couch island you
[863.52 - 867.04] can't function good you can't get into a
[865.12 - 869.68] car you're struggling you're suffering
[867.04 - 871.68] you'd prefer attention better than than
[869.68 - 873.36] just being stuck right not being able to
[871.68 - 875.60] live the life to where you want to live
[873.36 - 877.20] it right now at your fullest optimum
[875.60 - 879.20] possibilities
[877.20 - 881.36] deborah says or your family is just
[879.20 - 883.52] pretending you're fine and they
[881.36 - 886.24] completely ignore you
[883.52 - 888.24] and you are isolated alone that's a big
[886.24 - 891.68] one i've seen that too i've seen that
[888.24 - 892.64] for so many times over the years i do
[891.68 - 894.72] i think
[892.64 - 896.40] what happens is the reason why medical
[894.72 - 898.08] medium has always talked about this and
[896.40 - 899.60] this information medical medium and
[898.08 - 902.48] spirit of compassion has always told me
[899.60 - 903.44] to be wise about this like understand it
[902.48 - 905.20] and
[903.44 - 907.92] and understand what people are going
[905.20 - 909.36] through right and i i think that i've
[907.92 - 912.08] always done that i've gotten a lot of
[909.36 - 914.32] crap for it though for a lot of reasons
[912.08 - 915.92] cara says then you get the medical gas
[914.32 - 917.68] lighting the medical gas lighting is a
[915.92 - 919.76] whole other angle so think about that
[917.68 - 921.44] think about how many obstacles you get
[919.76 - 922.88] when you're a sick person right when
[921.44 - 924.48] you're somebody suffering with a mystery
[922.88 - 926.96] illness or a chronic illness just think
[924.48 - 928.48] about how many obstacles it's like land
[926.96 - 930.64] mines you're like okay you're cruising
[928.48 - 932.56] along here and now here you go you're
[930.64 - 934.32] trying you're you're struggling to fight
[932.56 - 936.48] for it you're fighting for your life and
[934.32 - 938.08] then boom the doctor gaslights you and
[936.48 - 939.44] tells you okay this and this and they go
[938.08 - 940.64] see a psychiatrist and you're fighting
[939.44 - 942.88] for your life you're fighting for your
[940.64 - 944.80] life and now your husband or or somebody
[942.88 - 946.72] else says yeah you are crazy you do need
[944.80 - 948.24] to you do need a psychiatrist try that
[946.72 - 949.84] try these pills and all of a sudden you
[948.24 - 950.88] get a dangerous reaction from the pills
[949.84 - 952.08] and now you're fighting for it and
[950.88 - 953.60] you're cruising along and now you get
[952.08 - 955.52] sick now you got the autoimmunes getting
[953.60 - 957.20] worse no one understands and all of a
[955.52 - 958.40] sudden your other family members or
[957.20 - 959.76] friends are like i can't hear your
[958.40 - 961.20] symptoms anymore i don't want to hear
[959.76 - 962.64] about it i don't want anything to do
[961.20 - 964.80] with any of it now you're fighting for
[962.64 - 967.68] that and now it's just one obstacle at
[964.80 - 969.28] another and it just keeps on going
[967.68 - 972.32] and it keeps on going and then the
[969.28 - 974.24] invisible illness part is so hard
[972.32 - 975.60] it's so hard when it's an invisible
[974.24 - 977.84] illness
[975.60 - 980.80] neil rimmer says
[977.84 - 982.64] the worst part is you still have to work
[980.80 - 984.96] you still have to get up every day and
[982.64 - 987.52] try and push through oh my god
[984.96 - 989.68] you have to try to juice you got to try

[1343.68 - 1347.12] in years that reached out
[1345.44 - 1348.80] and said
[1347.12 - 1350.96] that somebody told them they were
[1348.80 - 1352.16] creating their sickness
[1350.96 - 1355.84] right

[1358.24 - 1363.20] day because their dog was sick
[1361.68 - 1365.76] so i said

[1388.48 - 1392.72] was a dog
[1390.16 - 1395.76] trying to get attention so the dog was
[1392.72 - 1398.56] faking being sick

[1398.56 - 1403.76] thoughts

[1439.36 - 1444.24] the most unsensible stuff can happen
[1442.24 - 1446.80] that makes no sense at all there's all
[1444.24 - 1447.84] these spiritualists now most spiritual
[1446.80 - 1449.76] people

[1519.28 - 1522.80] out
[1520.24 - 1524.08] nobody wants a cold
[1522.80 - 1525.84] even though there aren't no colds
[1524.08 - 1528.00] anymore and i said that to you guys many
[1525.84 - 1530.80] times
[1528.00 - 1532.88] the flu is the only thing that was out
[1530.80 - 1534.56] until the recent plague
[1532.88 - 1537.68] right and the recent plague brought
[1534.56 - 1538.72] about brought about the flu family a flu
[1537.68 - 1541.44] family
[1538.72 - 1543.92] line right but the point is is there was

[1543.92 - 1546.88] want a cold i've seen people say you
[1545.44 - 1548.72] just wanted this cold right now you
[1546.88 - 1552.08] needed some down time to do some healing
[1548.72 - 1554.08] so your body took on the cold purposely
[1552.08 - 1556.00] your body took on the flu purposely
[1554.08 - 1558.48] that's just what you need it you need it
[1556.00 - 1560.32] to be down for three weeks with the flu
[1558.48 - 1562.72] and go through that that's what you
[1560.32 - 1565.20] needed you know you're you're and that's
[1562.72 - 1567.68] a whole nother thing i've heard too you

[1974.32 - 1978.08] this it isn't because of something bad
[1976.00 - 1981.04] you did in a past life or two lifetimes
[1978.08 - 1983.20] ago that's not why you're suffering
[1981.04 - 1986.16] the reason why
[1983.20 - 1988.84] the industries love when people
[1986.16 - 1991.20] scramble for answers and pick on
[1988.84 - 1994.08] themselves i have a fear of healing it's
[1991.20 - 1996.88] my fault i created it it hides what's
[1994.08 - 1998.24] really making everybody sick
[1996.88 - 2000.08] it hides
[1998.24 - 2002.56] the caffeine addictions which just
[2000.08 - 2005.60] slowly just ages people and tears them
[2002.56 - 2006.96] down it hides right it hides that it
[2005.60 - 2010.56] hides
[2006.96 - 2012.96] the injuries from the pharmaceuticals
[2010.56 - 2014.32] it hides that it hides the toxic heavy
[2012.96 - 2016.72] metals
[2014.32 - 2018.72] it hides the chemical warfare placed
[2016.72 - 2021.68] upon us every single day it hides the
[2018.72 - 2023.12] radiation exposure upon us when we go
[2021.68 - 2024.96] through the airports
[2023.12 - 2026.48] people you know how people are worried
[2024.96 - 2027.84] about cat scans they're like whoa it's a
[2026.48 - 2029.52] lot of radiation it is a lot of
[2027.84 - 2030.96] radiation but if your doctor tells you
[2029.52 - 2032.72] have to get a cat skin of course go get
[2030.96 - 2034.24] a cat scan but you know people are
[2032.72 - 2036.24] really worried about cat scans being a
[2034.24 - 2038.40] lot of radiation right this is a good
[2036.24 - 2040.64] thing to talk about right now
[2038.40 - 2042.48] you get a cat scan when you go through
[2040.64 - 2044.48] that airport
[2042.48 - 2046.40] we get a cat scan
[2044.48 - 2048.16] you get 400 chest x-rays when you walk
[2046.40 - 2049.52] through that airport all you got to be
[2048.16 - 2052.88] doing
[2049.52 - 2054.16] is walking past that baggage going in
[2052.88 - 2056.56] right there
[2054.16 - 2059.44] going in that radiation machine that
[2056.56 - 2061.12] unregulated insane amounts of radiation
[2059.44 - 2062.40] streaming out of that thing and then
[2061.12 - 2064.80] you're taking your baggage and the
[2062.40 - 2066.48] things glowing in the dark
[2064.80 - 2068.48] and then you put your clothes on after
[2066.48 - 2070.08] you that were in that baggage and you
[2068.48 - 2071.84] put them on and you put basically a
[2070.08 - 2073.36] radiation blanket all over your whole
[2071.84 - 2074.96] body you're getting by the time you're
[2073.36 - 2077.92] done with that whole trip you just had a
[2074.96 - 2079.28] cat scan or two
[2077.92 - 2082.16] there's all these other reasons why
[2079.28 - 2082.16] everybody's sick
[2082.32 - 2086.84] and it gets blamed on you
