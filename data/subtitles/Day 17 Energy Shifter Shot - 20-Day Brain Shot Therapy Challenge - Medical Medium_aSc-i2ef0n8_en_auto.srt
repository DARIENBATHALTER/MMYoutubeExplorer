1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
anybody who is energy deficient

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,259
that's a deficiency that's happening out

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,360
there people don't talk about they don't

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,980
people are lined up at the coffee shops

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,219
they're lined up

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,199
at all of the coffee chains and they're

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,060
just like getting their coffee people

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,800
have their coffee going on at home they

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,260
got their espressos

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,500
they got their Kombucha Tea which is

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,240
caffeine based almost every one of them

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,340
the point is is that everybody's

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,500
searching for energy but they're looking

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,680
for false energy

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,440
they're looking for fake energy

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,420
and they're looking for stimulated

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,120
energy coming from a drug source

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,340
everybody is feeling malaise and

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,320
listless and tired

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,480
almost everybody in the world right now

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,820
and the people that say I don't have any

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,160
energy problems I'm not listless I'm not

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,500
malazed I'm not tired I got plenty of

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,199
energy and you ask them what are they

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,640
doing what are they eating every day and

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,920
they'll be like well I have my iced

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,540
coffees I have my espressos I have my

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
coffee in the morning

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,780
and if you took that away from them

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,280
they would go into withdraw

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,640
and they would go into that withdrawal

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,880
and they would actually be like whoa

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,560
I do have an energy problem

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,119
you ask them what else do you do to be

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
like matcha

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,259
tea green tea

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,020
black tea

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:36,360
they're always searching and seeking for

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:38,460
energy from drug sources

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,820
and they don't even realize it because

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,380
there's a severe energy deficiency

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,079

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,420

don't blame them they're doing it

93
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,180
because they either got hooked onto it

94
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,280
early on in life like an addiction so

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,659
they're cooked hooked on the drug or

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,599
they're doing it

97
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:54,120
because they don't feel good brain fog

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,099
focusing concentration issues all of it

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,640

medium information

you know what happened was when I did

132
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,360
that and I talked about how bad caffeine

133
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,340
was and how it was destroying adrenal

134
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,979
glands destroying people's brains really

135
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,780
like causing problems wreaking havoc why

136
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,340
people were on that caffeine the

137
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,100
caffeine industry causing all these

138
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,680

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,740

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,539
on day 17.

153
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,120
I cheated

154
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,820
I had a cheat day so I'm gonna have to

155
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,759
come clean with this

156
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,340
what I had this morning was an energy

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,680
sifter and I did it already today

158
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,080
because

159
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,639
and I'm trying to calm myself down but

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,560
we're gonna do I'm gonna do another one

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,539
which is really exciting and I can't

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,860
wait all right all right calm down calm

163
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,220

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,500
all caffeine last Thursday whoa now on

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,600
day seven of headaches more withdrawal

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,460
is rough I rarely get headaches so

168
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,240
assume this must be withdrawal symptoms

169
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,000
I would probably agree ask your doctor

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,440
what your doctor thinks but if that you

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,199
know if that was a family member that

172
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,360
asked me that pretty recently okay

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,880
believe it or not family member asked me

174
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,000
that who got off their caffeine and

175
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,400
contacted me I said yes that was

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,360
withdrawal creating the headache all

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,580

181
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,720
glucose glycogen guess what

182
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:24,479

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,380
without glucose in our bloodstream we

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,139
die

185
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,580

glucose and glycogen your brain is an

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,979
organ that needs food just as much as

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
your stomach needs it

190
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:48,319
your brain relies on that food

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,319
which turns into energy to function

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,300
what food does your brain really need

193
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,360
what does what does your brain need

194
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,819
I don't get it slaughter a pig does your

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,500
brain need all that fat from the pig

196
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,259
meat

197
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,599
does it does it need all that fat from

198
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,060
the hog that was slaughtered

199
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,620
is that what your brain needs kind of

200
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,460
curious

201
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,860
what food does your brain really need

202
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,900
glucose

203
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,599
it needs glucose

204
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,539
our brain is mostly made out of glycogen

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,660
that is stored glucose

206
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:29,660
our brain is a glycogen ball

207
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,560
we get our first glucose and glycogen

208
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,620
through our mothers

209
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,459
while we're in the womb

210
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,860
if you put a pregnant mom on a keto diet

211
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,320
a real keto diet

212
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,839
and don't have any of that beautiful

213
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,140
glucose that you need from sweet

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,120
potatoes and potatoes and carrots

215
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,120
and fruit and bananas

216
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,560
if you put a pregnant woman

217
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,560
on a carb-free diet

218
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,279
the baby will be damaged

219
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,519
if you've been a pregnant woman on a

220
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,180
keto diet a real keto diet the baby will

221
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,180
be damaged

222
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,339
making a lot of friends today once again

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,959
seaweed hero good to see you making lots

224
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,899
of friends

225
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,700
we get our first glucose and glycogen

226
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,519
through our mothers

227
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,300
while we're in the womb and then through

228
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,300
breast milk

229
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,920
breast milk is it is defined by its

230
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,459
natural sugar content what

231
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,860
there's sugar and breast milk huh

232
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,899
that's impossible

233
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,640
breast milk is defined by its natural

234
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,320
sugar content

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,800
comparatively

236
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,220
it has little fat and protein

237
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,180
breast milk has little fat and little

238
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,180
protein

239
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:14,339
and that bioavailable Sugar creates the

240
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:17,040
building blocks of a baby's brain

241
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,360
so when the baby's born

242
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:25,560
the baby is Reliant upon

243
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,440
glucose in the mother's breast milk

244
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,200
that glucose in the mother's breast milk

245
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,339
is the building blocks to the baby's

246
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,339
brain for development

247
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:42,060
if a newborn isn't able to breastfeed

248
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,240
those beneficial sugars

249
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,459
come a bit later from ingredients like

250
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,459
fruits and sweet potatoes in baby food

251
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,820
if you put a baby a newborn baby on a

252
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,820
keto diet

253
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:05,300
lacking carbs and sugar and glucose

254
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,300
that baby will starve to death

255
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,180
very interesting

256
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,180
isn't it

257
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,700
that's why formulas have sugar in them

258
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,160
by the way

259
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,320
so I think science realizes

260
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,620
that the babies they tested the original

261
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,660
formulas on that had no sugar in them

262
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,660
probably didn't fare so good

263
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,800
a portion of this early Glide by the way

264
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,480
they did studies back in the 1940s and

265
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,519
1950s

266
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,680
and they didn't care what happened to

267
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,779
the babies

268
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,779
studies were scary as

269
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,320
they were so scary

270
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,959
they took human beings

271
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,940
and you signed up your baby

272
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,680
and you thought okay no big deal I'll

273
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,779
sign up my baby

274
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,880
and they took babies and they did that

275
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:02,760
they would give babies different diets

276
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,000
and see what develops

277
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,500
that's what they did back then

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Untold Carnage man

279
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,279
a portion of this early glycogen which

280
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,740
is the sugar right you guys the glucose

281
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,680
is permanently sealed off

282
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,100
creating actual brain tissue what does

283
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,100
that mean

284
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,360
developing babies

285
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,839
are drinking the breast milk or the

286
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,180
formula with sugar or whatever

287
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,399
they're getting that early glucose

288
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,839
because it's developing brain tissue but

289
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,480
here's what it's doing that early

290
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,880
glucose Supply and science and research

291
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,279
doesn't know this part right here

292
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,839
I don't have to cite my publisher said

293
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,820
well you're not taking it from anywhere

294
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,079
this is original unique information from

295
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,779
above

296
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,180
so we can't we can't have you cite

297
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,040
anything medical medium because there's

298
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,660
nothing soluble in here it's all

299
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,600
original unique information in these

300
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,200
Bibles here these eight Bibles

301
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,079
what happens is the original sugars

302
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,940
from the mom when the baby was in the

303
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,040
womb

304
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,500
are the building blocks to brain tissue

305
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,959
then when the baby's born

306
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,200
and the baby's breastfeeding

307
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,480
the baby's getting more continual

308
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,880
building blocks

309
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,959
creating new brain tissue permanent

310
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,959
brain tissue so a portion of the glucose

311
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:33,800
turns into hardened glycogen

312
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,700
which is the permanent brain tissue

313
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,700
foundation for the baby

314
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,000
those beneficial sugars come a bit later

315
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,160
from ingredients like fruits and sweet

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,200
potatoes and baby food a portion of this

317
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,480
ready a portion of this early glycogen

318
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,000
which is the sugars the glucose is

319
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,279
permanently sealed off so that means

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,920
that sugars from the breast milk that

321
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,139
the baby's ingesting a portion of that

322
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,180
goes to the brain and then becomes

323
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,220
sealed off and becomes permanent brain

324
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,360
tissue

325
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,920
foreign

326
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,019
if you don't believe it's coming from

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,019
above this information then I'm a genius

328
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,079
if you don't like thinking I talk to a

329
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,300
voice and that's just inconceivable

330
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,100
then I must be a genius just think I'm a

331
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,100
genius get the information learn grow

332
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,899
and heal get the books be it Advance

333
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,940
with the information and heal heal your

334
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,040
loved ones and you don't have to think I

335
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,279
hear it from above just I'm a genius

336
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,279
then

337
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,160
but please cite the information back to

338
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,060
my geniusness

339
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,060
if you can

340
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,199
a portion of this early glycogen is

341
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,880
permanently sealed off creating actual

342
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,440
brain tissue which science and research

343
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,959
does not know

344
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,079
stored in such a way that it will never

345
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,600
be disturbed in the future

346
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,540
to a degree your brain keeps adding to

347
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,019
that foundational glycogen storage as it

348
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,880
continues to develop through childhood

349
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,880
teenage years and your early twenties

350
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,360
glycogen tissue is the figurative meat

351
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,660
on the brain's bone

352
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,220
it's that early glycogen that's the meat

353
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,079
on the bone

354
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,980
that's what it is

355
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,860
it's an original early glycogen storage

356
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,339
that becomes the permanent resident of

357
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,339
the brain

358
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,160
if someone were to tear into your brain

359
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,660
as though it were a drumstick like eat

360
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,760
it like

361
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,040
if they were going to do that like tear

362
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,760
into the brain like I had a good brain

363
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,760
abroad here

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,320
they were to do that

365
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:02,839
that gray matter flesh would be made

366
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,839
from pockets of decades old glycogen

367
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,899
it would be made from decades-old

368
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,360
glycogen so if you were to tear into an

369
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,579
adult's human brain

370
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,120
and tear into that and crunch into that

371
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:20,519
and eat the brain right

372
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,160
if you were to do that

373
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,959
you that would be old glycogen you're

374
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,160
eating you're eating glycogen from

375
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
decades ago

376
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:39,000
sugars are your brain's place of origin

377
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,820
your brain also starts to collect

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,180
glycogen in storage bins to be used for

379
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,180
fuel

380
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,800
the spider web of glycogen connective

381
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,740
tissue is a safe haven for new brain

382
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,199
cell development it's how brain cells

383
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,759
are birthed

384
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:02,759
their birth

385
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,759
in that glycogen spiderweb

386
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,799
is there any fat in a healthy brain

387
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,299
that's in a healthy body

388
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,559
so let's talk about that a little bit

389
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,839
because you'll you'll see you'll look

390
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,900
into things if you're like keto science

391
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:19,980
says our brain is made out of fat it's

392
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,220
90 fat keto says you know that our brain

393
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,780
you know ancient man I love when they

394
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,579
throw that ancient crap around all the

395
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,439
time like anybody knew what anybody did

396
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,580
in the ancient world like anybody even

397
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,919
knew

398
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,200
like what everybody's always like

399
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,059
ancient medicine what or how about this

400
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,080
one ancient Chinese medicine are you

401
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,380
kidding

402
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,539
they gave Emperors Mercury elixirs that

403
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,059
was the medicine of the time Chinese

404
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,059
medicine was Mercury you drink toxic

405
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,400
heavy metal that was Chinese medicine

406
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:53,460
and you know what else everybody thinks

407
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
herbal medicine was everywhere Native

408
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,179
Americans were using some herbal

409
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,020
medicine yes but can I just say this

410
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,179
Chinese medicine they used bugs

411
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,520
if you go into the old Chinese medicine

412
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:09,720
apotheses that were resembling what used

413
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,600
to be it was all wings of of toads legs

414
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,460
of toads wings of butterflies it was all

415
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,799
like

416
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,980
um it was all fish dehydrated fish

417
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,919
pieces fins of fish and then it was like

418
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,740
bats and bat wings and it was like bird

419
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:31,220
feather crushed it was all of that you

420
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,220
go to you go to Apothecary in China

421
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,200
and back then alternate medicine and

422
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,559
this happened it sent for centuries it

423
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,580
was just nothing but bugs and critters

424
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:47,520
claws of Critters claws of bugs Wings

425
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,020
bones bone dust it was all of this like

426
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,660
just the pocket theories were nothing

427
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,179
but all of that there weren't a lot of

428
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,539
herbs I'm sorry to say that that came

429
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,179
from later on

430
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:02,700
later on isn't that incredible some

431
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,200
people say oh ancient it was ancient no

432
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,160
not really

433
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,160
not at all

434
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,740
I just love when they do that Ancient

435
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,940
Man ate this oh really were you there

436
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,940
you know

437
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,760
it is recorded though

438
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:26,460
that that in Chinese medicine the number

439
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:29,460
one the number one Elixir treatment and

440
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,520
cure was Mercury

441
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,440
Emperors went mad they were given Doses

442
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,880
and doses of mercury to try to cure

443
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,020
their ales that is actual

444
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,520
historically true

445
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,559
so I'm kind of tired when I hear this

446
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,360
all the time you see on social media

447
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,980
you know when I take information from

448
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,660
above and it goes in these books and

449
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,039
nobody never even knew anything about it

450
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,900
someone would be like oh that was

451
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,940
probably ancient no

452
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,100
that was ancient fists this is what you

453
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,500
hear it's it's insane

454
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,679
is there any fat in a healthy brain

455
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,780
that's in a healthy body

456
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,580
yes

457
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,900
it's time to research you want don't

458
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,460
want to tell you that the brain is just

459
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,140
made out of all fat now alternative

460
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,440
medicine is like ah the brain's made out

461
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,200
of fat it's all fat now oh really

462
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,200
it's interesting

463
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,360
yes there is extremely low levels of fat

464
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
compared to what science and research

465
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,200
theorize you ready theorize

466
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,299
science and research are

467
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:38,780
basing a theory that the brain is loaded

468
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,780
with fat that's basing a theory

469
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,559
is there any fat in a healthy brain

470
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,900
yes

471
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,460
but there's extremely low levels of fat

472
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,820
compared to what science and research

473
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:55,760
theorize the fat in the brain is a small

474
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,760
fraction of the brain itself

475
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,419
the fat in the brain is a small fraction

476
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,880
of the brain itself that's important to

477
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,740
know get ready for this

478
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,960
the healthier the person's brain and

479
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,080
body are the smaller the fraction of fat

480
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,620
that resides inside the brain

481
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,260
the healthier a person is

482
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,020
the lower the amount of fat resides

483
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,260
inside the brain

484
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,600
the more unhealthy of the brain and body

485
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,760
are the higher levels of fat that reside

486
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,320
inside the brain so if someone is really

487
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,179
obese

488
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,539
they're going to have more fat in their

489
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,539
brain

490
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,799
get ready for this

491
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,480
this is incredible information by the

492
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,720
way

493
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,780
the cadavers that medical science used

494
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,299
to determine a basis for how much fat

495
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,159
resides inside the brain where cadavers

496
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:57,260
of older age

497
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,260
and of the poorest health

498
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,960
the cadaver's brains were atrophied and

499
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,880
what was replacing the atrophy were fat

500
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,980
deposits here you ever eat chicken

501
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,419
before have you ever eaten did you ever

502
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,659
eat chicken

503
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,280
did you ever buy a roasted chicken

504
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,280
did you ever eat a roasted chicken

505
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,640
this is super Advanced information right

506
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,440
here by the way

507
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,940
from above super Advanced information

508
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,919
it's in the brain saver book you really

509
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,700
should get these brand saver books page

510
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,700
number 412

511
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,919
have you ever eaten a roasted chicken

512
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,480
do you ever find those fatty deposits in

513
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,240
the roasted chicken

514
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,159
those yellow yellowy strands of fat

515
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,159
deposits

516
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,440
the more unhealthy the chicken was and

517
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,440
raised the more the fat deposits were

518
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,220
if you purchased a regular conventional

519
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,900
chicken that was caged up and fed all

520
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,080
this crap

521
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,940
and got it nice and plump and you cut

522
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
open that roasted chicken and you ate

523
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,840
that roasted chicken like yum

524
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,340
you would find a lot more of the yellowy

525
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,100
hunks

526
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,720
of fatty deposits all throughout the

527
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,760
chicken

528
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,620
but guess what you don't see the

529
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,360
chicken's brain

530
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,440
because the chicken's heads are cut off

531
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,440
by the machines right

532
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,760
so those heads just get discarded

533
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,100
probably ground up and thrown into dog

534
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,580
food or whatever

535
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,059
canned dog food the point is is those

536
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:39,059
chickens brains were filled with fat

537
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,919
the unhealthier that the chicken is

538
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,720
the more the brain of the chicken is

539
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,240
filled with fat

540
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,940
just like the chicken itself and then

541
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,940
when you eat a lean bird maybe a wild

542
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,799
bird what about wild pheasant

543
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,200
Wild Quail

544
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,559
Partridge if you've ever eaten a wild

545
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,419
Partridge you can't find fat on the

546
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,520
Partridge

547
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,799
you can go through the Partridge and be

548
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,299
like this Partridge is good and eat it

549
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,059
right down to the bone

550
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:12,559
and you won't find a lot of fat on a on

551
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,559
a partridge that's caught in the wild

552
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,880
so what they did what science and and

553
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,159
research did

554
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,640
was when they were looking at brains

555
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,320
back years ago to look for a composition

556
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:31,620
they were picking old people that died

557
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,320
old obese people that died

558
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,200
their brains had fat deposits riddled

559
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,120
all around the brain in and around the

560
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,059
cavities including inside the cavity

561
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,400
where that gaping hole opens up inside

562
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,679
the middle of the brain as the brain

563
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,020
atrophies as people get older and

564
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,039
healthier and unhealthier and their

565
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,039
brain starts to die

566
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,640
they tested brains that were old

567
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,140
and decaying and atrophy and filled with

568
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,880
fat

569
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,640
they didn't take

570
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,440
a 20 year old's brain who was eating

571
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,460
healthy

572
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,460
and use that

573
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,320
back in the 1940s they took somebody

574
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,299
very obese who died a terrible death of

575
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,760
sickness and illness whose brain was

576
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,940
atrophying they cut that cadaver open

577
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,200
and they took that person's brain

578
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,200
and that's what they did

579
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,679
should I have taken the energy shifter

580
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,539
first like I did because I did an energy

581
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,539
shifter first and I flexibly wound up

582
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,279
Ava says Ava Sheridan says Oh wow was

583
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,080
wondering why it was so hard to

584
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,900
determine how much fat was in a brain

585
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,120
not studying healthy brains

586
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,500
they don't study brains anymore for fat

587
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,480
versus not fat this was done in the 40s

588
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,059
they did that they concluded their

589
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,360
science in 1940.

590
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,580
they took old deceased people who had

591
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,000
atrophy and they were overweight totally

592
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,679
obese in 1940. that's who they used as

593
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,179
the cadavers they don't even they don't

594
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,500
even check anybody's brains for fat

595
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,539
anymore

596
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,460
now because people are so much on the

597
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,320
fat diet and everything oh healthy fat

598
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,640
they just assume oh they're Brands made

599
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,640
out of fat sounds like a good one

600
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,820
and nowadays people are really unhealthy

601
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,020
and children are getting more fat in

602
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,580
their brains than they ever did before

603
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,900
everybody's getting more fat in their

604
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,360
brains than they ever did before it's

605
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,340
like that bad roasted chicken from a

606
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,320
conventional farm that was pumped up

607
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,980
with all kinds of stuff and fed all

608
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,960
kinds of bad food and bad feed

609
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,760
and you don't see that chicken's brain

610
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,260
they cut it off they cut that chicken's

611
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,480
head off that chicken's head off went

612
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,760
into the basket and that was it

613
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,240
gone went down the chute

614
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,520
that chicken's brain was filled with fat

615
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,860
they don't study chicken fat and brains

616
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,020
like they don't take animals and say

617
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,580
well this animal came from somebody's

618
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,559
backyard that was big that was feeding

619
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,720
off of bugs and lettuce and we're gonna

620
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,400
check that chicken Sprain and then we're

621
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,100
gonna check it compared to this old

622
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,620
chicken that was like fed all this

623
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,900
garbage and crap

624
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,880
they don't even do that science just

625
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,159
lets everybody down they never do

626
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,520
anything right with practically almost

627
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,520
everything

628
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,840
brains were atrophied and what was

629
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,600
replacing the atrophy were fat deposits

630
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,820
and and the cadavers they used fat repl

631
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,740
here's when you age and you're not

632
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,720
taking care of your brain

633
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,360
and you're obese

634
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,580
it happens this life is hard

635
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,900
and and you're not taught to take care

636
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,100
of yourself maybe you don't have the

637
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,080
resources you're just having really

638
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,720
difficult time in life and if you're

639
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,460
older you're obese your brain's

640
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,360
atrophying

641
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,700
there's a lot more fat inside the brain

642
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,679
and even if you're not obese there's

643
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,900
more fat inside people's brains now than

644
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,779
ever before because of unhealthy brains

645
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,400
but regardless there's still a fraction

646
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,400
of fat compared to not

647
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,200
neuro ion says can people be absolutely

648
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,580
healthy and still have some fat beneath

649
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,980
the skin

650
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,159
we all have a little bit of fat inside

651
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:26,520
of us absolutely naturally occurring

652
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:29,700
it's not about not having a scrap of fat

653
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,620
inside the body that's not it but yes

654
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,960
there's healthy levels of fat that

655
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,200
people have inside you know their body

656
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,440
but got to keep in mind

657
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,460
a fatty liver is really bad

658
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,460
that's bad

659
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,640
and that's important to know that gives

660
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,960
you a window on how it's not good to

661
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,960
have fat inside our body it's true

662
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,100
it isn't 60 of the brain made out of fat

663
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,100
it's much lower

664
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,860
it's not 60 percent

665
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,480
it's supposed to be much much lower

666
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,760
so let's talk about this a little bit

667
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,260
the fat inside the brain of a healthy

668
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,779
person should be roughly the same

669
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,799
percentage of fat as in every organ in

670
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,799
the body did you hear that part

671
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,860
that's important right there that alone

672
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,500
Bethpage says can you be skinny and have

673
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,320
a fatty brain yes because you could have

674
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,840
a fatty liver and be skinny

675
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,940
you can have a toxic overburdened

676
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,460
fatty liver

677
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,720
and have too much fat occurring in the

678
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,720
brain that you're not supposed to have

679
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,179
the fat inside the brain of a healthy

680
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,159
person should be roughly the same

681
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,840
percentage of fat as in every other

682
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,179
organ in the body just like when

683
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,220
someone's liver becomes unhealthy and

684
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,860
starts to take on additional fat and

685
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,260
becomes a fatty liver your brain can

686
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,919
take on additional fat and become a

687
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,919
fatty brain

688
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,440
the brain can do the same becoming an

689
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,120
unhealthy brain that takes on additional

690
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,500
fat and becomes a fatty brain

691
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,140
instead of Medical Science understanding

692
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,000
that the same thing that occurs to the

693
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,799
liver can happen to the brain they

694
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,799
theorize that the brain is supposed to

695
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,559
have that much more additional fat

696
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,659
in truth a healthy 20 year old in good

697
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:30,240
shape does not have a brain that's made

698
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,260
of sixty percent fat

699
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,260
why is that

700
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,340
the roughly 60 percent fat inside the

701
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,899
brain that medical research and science

702
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,260
claim

703
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:49,440
is not all omegas

704
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,120
so here's the real trick of the trade

705
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,779
out there of science and research and

706
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,940
alternative science right

707
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:59,039
healthy fats healthy fats good for your

708
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,899
brain all omega-3 your brain's made out

709
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,240
of fat your brain's made out of fat your

710
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,820
brain's not not made out of

711
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,279
Omega-3 your brain fat isn't made out of

712
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,860
Omega-3

713
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,899
there's microscopic amounts of Omega-3

714
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,899
in the brain yes and that's healthy

715
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:22,320
small small deposits of Omega-3 the fat

716
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,960
people get in their brain creating a

717
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,960
fatty brain isn't Omega-3

718
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,360
the roughly 60 percent

719
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,860
of fat inside the brain that medical

720
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,860
research and science claim

721
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,720
it's not all omegas

722
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,919
the fat that accumulates in the brain is

723
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,919
the same as the fat

724
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:56,340
that's in a sick liver

725
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,039
which is also not all omegas and that's

726
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,620
what's interesting oh omega-3s

727
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,500
gotta get your omegas your brain needs

728
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,419
your omegas they need those Omega-3s oh

729
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,820
you got a fatty liver oh you must have

730
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,860
too much omega-3 inside your liver

731
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,860
no it's not Omega-3

732
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,320
it's garbage fat

733
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,100
that's inside your liver it's garbage

734
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,659
fat

735
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,460
oh your brain

736
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,140
your brain's got a lot of fat in there

737
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,580
oh it must be all Omega-3s are you

738
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,080
kidding me your brain's not filled with

739
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,059
omega-3s

740
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,059
your brain has garbage fat in it

741
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,760
why am I yelling

742
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,760
why am I so loud today

743
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,659
the fat that accumulates in the brain is

744
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,960
the same as the fat that's in a sick

745
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,460
liver which is also not all omegas

746
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,720
when people have effect when you get

747
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,720
diagnosed with a fatty liver

748
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
you're in the waiting room you're

749
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,779
waiting for your diagnosis the doctor

750
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,940
wants to come in and see you

751
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:02,460
the internist wants to come come and see

752
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:06,799
the GP wants to come and see you

753
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,799
well I have something to tell you sir

754
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,840
Mrs Johnson

755
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,779
I want to talk to you about your

756
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,360
diagnosis here from what it looks like

757
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,880
from all our blood work and

758
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,340
and the biopsy we did also on your liver

759
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,760
sorry about that

760
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,000
it looks like ma'am you have a fatty

761
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,000
liver

762
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,659
foreign

763
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,039
no it's not Omega-3

764
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,840
what is it it's garbage fat

765
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,620
same thing in the brain

766
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,620
garbage truck

767
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,080
the fat that accumulates in the brain is

768
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,659
the same as the fat that accumulates in

769
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,480
a sick liver but they're not diagnosing

770
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:56,760
a fatty brain it's medical medium

771
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,340
information they're not they're not

772
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,960
diagnosing fatty brain out there

773
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,960
they'll say fatty liver

774
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,179
they'll say fatty liver but they won't

775
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,720
say fatty brain instead they will accept

776
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,760
the higher levels of brain fat that are

777
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,159
happening in people's unhealthy bodies

778
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,080
they're getting fatty livers even if

779
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,500
they're skinny and they're getting fatty

780
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,500
brains

781
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,879
I'm Dr Wiggy woggy here

782
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,020
fatty liver

783
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,659
excuse me what's your question

784
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,119
your question is it must be all Omega-3s

785
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,639
I don't know

786
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,399
I'm just thinking fat is good good is

787
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,440
fat good Fat's good you can eat more

788
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,659
avocados and nuts and seeds and get all

789
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,580
the omegas you want

790
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,560
but I'm wondering maybe that might make

791
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,780
your liver fatter

792
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,399
I don't know is your brain filled with

793
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,679
fat

794
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,359
the fat that accumulates in the brain is

795
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,359
the same is the fat that's in a sick

796
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,280
liver which is also not all omegas guess

797
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,960
what news flash

798
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,700
to all doctors

799
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,020
it's not a megas

800
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,020
it's not omega-3s

801
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,960
that person with the fatty liver doesn't

802
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,820
have a fatty liver because it's filled

803
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,200
with Omega-3s that person with a fatty

804
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,359
brain which they don't even know they

805
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,900
have a fatty brain is not filled with

806
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,900
omega-3s

807
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,099
it's fatty deposits of what

808
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,500
Spirit of compassion used for a word

809
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:34,200
because

810
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,960
when when the information is being

811
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,200
messaged from me into these books after

812
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,220
hearing the words I have to use soc's

813
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,560
word

814
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,960
which is its fatty deposits of

815
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,960
unproductive fat I call it garbage fat

816
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,980
are there omegas inside a healthy brain

817
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:59,280
yes there are

818
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,660
do they play a role question mark yes

819
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,000
they do

820
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm reading from brain saver

821
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,320
page 412

822
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,599
you gotta have the books get the books

823
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,520

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,380
can you handle it

835
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,060
that's the question because

836
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,859
the information just the blood draw

837
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,020
chapter alone just the eating disorder

838
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,359
chapter alone just the OCD chapter alone

839
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,000
like I can't even tell you these books

840
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,220
are unbelievable it was one big book and

841
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,339
now it's two big books had to be cut in

842
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,339
half

843
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,500
foreign

844
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,839
energy shifter today I'm looking forward

845
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,099
to another energy shifter I had one this

846
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,220
morning

847
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,780
are there omegas inside a healthy brain

848
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,440
question mark

849
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,440
yes

850
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,760
do they play a role question mark yes

851
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,240
they do

852
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,579
it's a small role

853
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,099
the role these Trace omegas play inside

854
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:32,700
the brain is the same role they play

855
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,040
inside all organs inside the body

856
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:38,420
since when did they totally screw

857
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,420
everybody over with this one

858
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,220
they made like

859
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,440
omega-3s

860
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,440
and omegas were critical for the brain

861
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:55,280
But the irony is it's critical in its

862
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,280
small role for every part of the body

863
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,760
Omega-3s in the same way that liver

864
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,740
needs the omega-3 the spleen needs

865
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,900
omega-3 your pancreas needs the omega-3

866
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,880
your brain needs it your heart needs the

867
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,200
omega-3 the same way but for some reason

868
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,700
they centered it all on the brain

869
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,099
because it was like

870
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,560
a way to

871
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,700
BS more and more people like they knew

872
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,700
brain science or something

873
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,020
you wake up one morning and you have

874
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:24,119
really bad brain fog and you can't think

875
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,740
and you're walking around and you feel

876
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,300
like you're going insane and you go to

877
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,619
the neurologist and the doctorates of

878
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,320
the neurologist another doctor and

879
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,060
everything you'll see how fast brain

880
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,280
science really works

881
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,060
you'll see what brain science even is

882
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,060
it's

883
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:44,220
ma'am we did an MRI everything looks

884
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:46,320
okay uh maybe you just need a rest

885
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,400
you're overworking oh you're not working

886
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,400
that hard

887
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,619
um let's see brain science brain science

888
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,660
all the trillions of dollars so-called

889
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,700
going into brain science uh ma'am you

890
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,920
have let's see you have brain fog it

891
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,020
feels foggy you you focus and

892
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,579
concentration issues

893
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,579
um you have a hard time understanding

894
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:09,119
what I'm saying or speaking hmm we

895
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,400
didn't MRI hmm we did blood work hmm

896
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,260
maybe you need more healthy fats because

897
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,420
that's what this article says over here

898
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,579
when I look online in this article maybe

899
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,380
you need Omega-3s ma'am you'll see how

900
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,560
fast brain science works when you get

901
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,560
sick

902
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,220
says every sentence of this book is

903
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,480
mind-blowing

904
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,760
is

905
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,040
it's filled with so much important

906
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,260
information this book is the most

907
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,540
important book of our time fill the true

908
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,420
answers to our elements

909
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,900
in the antidotes to heal us and the

910
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,019
antidotes to heal us

911
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,019
[Music]

912
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,920
the role these trace minerals play

913
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,980
inside the brain is the same role they

914
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,940
play inside all organs in the body they

915
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,940
act as insulation for cold temperatures

916
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,940
boom

917
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,079
research in science had no idea that

918
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,200
omega-3s

919
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,260
are an insulator for the entire body

920
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,359
from cold temperatures

921
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,960
that's Advanced Medical information

922
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,180
right here from above in the book

923
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,599
two years from now you'll be hearing it

924
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,980
out there as they thief and theft and

925
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,980
take and steal and poach this

926
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,800
maybe next week at this rate

927
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,560
omegas inside all organs including

928
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,900
inside the brain are there to act as a

929
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,240
mild barrier inhibiting the body from

930
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,700
going into shock too fast from cold

931
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,099
temperatures

932
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,380
nobody knows and medical research and

933
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:55,619
science alternative science none of it

934
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,660
knows that the omegas are in every organ

935
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:00,060
they're there

936
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,859
to inhibit shock

937
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,119
from drastic cold temperatures that

938
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,119
happen really quickly in someone

939
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,760
say Laura says I'm 5'9 and about 115

940
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,380
pounds and have so many conditions and

941
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,380
symptoms of a fatty liver

942
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,760
and yet glorifying the importance of

943
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,359
fats for the brain doesn't save us

944
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,359
for the brain fats are a small tool with

945
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,700
a relatively small purpose compared to

946
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,020
the major significance of Sugar's role

947
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,020
in keeping you alive

948
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,740
the role that Sugar plays in the brain

949
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,760
is monumental

950
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,079
compared to the significance of fats

951
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,359
for one

952
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,400
there's that glycogen storage acquired

953
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,020
in baby hood that I talk about before if

954
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,940
you hop down here now

955
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,500
on this live please go back to the

956
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,500
beginning sometime when it's posted

957
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:04,140
for one there's that glycogen storage

958
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,420
acquired in babyhood childhood in young

959
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,000
adulthood that keeps the brain healthy

960
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,640
and prevents atrophy

961
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,839
being starved of glucose for too long

962
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,839
shrinks the brain

963
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,540
it's one reason why millions and

964
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,880
millions of Americans are suffering from

965
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,520
brain issues and it's another reason why

966
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,700
you can't do a keto diet

967
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,020
a real keto diet like they tried years

968
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,180
ago

969
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,260
you'll notice keto diets have sugar in

970
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,960
them now

971
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,540
huh I'm confused why is it called the

972
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,800
keto diet then you can't go into ketosis

973
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,220
if you're eating foods that have sugar

974
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,980
in them and avocados part sugar

975
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,500
you can't go into ketosis with an

976
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,520
avocado but they brought avocados into

977
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,859
the keto diet the pre-keto diet did not

978
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,780
have avocado in it

979
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:58,280
and people lost their glucose their

980
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,280
glycogen storages in the brain

981
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,599
keto diets now have berries in there

982
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,060
berries have sugar in there they're

983
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,740
sugar and berries why is that allowed in

984
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,960
the keto diet now

985
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,579
because the old keto diet actually

986
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,579
killed a bunch of people

987
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:17,940
I talked to one doctor that said whole

988
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,500
bunch of his colleagues and he didn't he

989
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,819
didn't buy it at all a whole bunch of

990
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,099
his colleagues were doing the keto diet

991
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:25,079
back in the 80s back in the 90s when

992
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,280
they were doing just keto where was you

993
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,200
aren't allowed sugars you weren't

994
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,359
allowed carbs you weren't allowed honey

995
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,740
you weren't allowed berries you weren't

996
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,839
allowed any of that and they lost

997
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,060
patience they died because when they

998
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,859
followed that rule they starved to death

999
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,780
in their brain atrophied

1000
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:42,660
the same way with the carnivore diet now

1001
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,520
huh why is the carnivore diet allowing

1002
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,760
honey in it now

1003
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,520
because a whole bunch of idiots that got

1004
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,720
tricked into the you know carnivore diet

1005
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,280
meaning where they're trying to sell

1006
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,839
carnivore programs they're trying to be

1007
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,880
like carnivore experts where they only

1008
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,280
do animal meat by itself and that's it

1009
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
they couldn't hack it because you need

1010
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,020
sugar for the brain they were going off

1011
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,700
their carnivore diets and binging and

1012
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,660
then going back on their carnivore diets

1013
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,660
does it sound familiar

1014
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,660
staying away from carbs and sugar and

1015
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,119
then binging and then having to go back

1016
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,339
on no carbs and sugar

1017
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,380
even though meat has a tiny bit of sugar

1018
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:22,079
in it in the blood of the meat it's

1019
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,940
still not enough to actually purpose

1020
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,140
how much someone needs to do or use

1021
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,060
their brain

1022
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,740
and so they were bumping into walls on

1023
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,599
the carnivore diet

1024
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,700
and so they were adding berries now

1025
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,740
there's berries in the carnivore diet

1026
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,140
there's berries in the keto diet there's

1027
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:41,160
sugar in all the Ketone carnivore diets

1028
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,220
how why because you couldn't survive you

1029
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,760
would die you would literally die your

1030
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,940
brain needs sugar it's critical

1031
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,940
foreign

1032
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,880
it's either the information from above

1033
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,560
or I'm a genius because they took that

1034
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,920
information from medical medium in the

1035
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:05,339
carnivore diet peeps now they do medical

1036
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,140
medium sugars berries and raw honey and

1037
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,640
whatever

1038
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,380
because they know their brain runs on

1039
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,119
sugar they know because the medical

1040
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,859
medium info because science doesn't talk

1041
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,859
about it out there about how that works

1042
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,819
Rita

1043
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,560
oh my god wow Anthony I'm relearning

1044
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:29,520
everything now I was listening to

1045
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,920
months ago

1046
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,260
and he was talking about straight keto

1047
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,579
and blueberry smoothies

1048
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,660
staying away from sugar well

1049
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:41,900
steals a lot of medical medium

1050
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,900
information

1051
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:50,040
and then humors his crowd with it

1052
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,540
as if he knew the information before but

1053
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,940
he doesn't

1054
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,579
and yes why are they doing blueberry

1055
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,280
smoothies now why are keto diets doing

1056
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,500
blueberry smoothies

1057
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,240
interesting

1058
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,980
why do people want to do a blueberry

1059
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,260
smoothie uh medical medium information

1060
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,040
the wild blueberry smoothies and notice

1061
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,839
people are talking about wild

1062
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,119
blueberries now out there

1063
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,099
as if we didn't already talk about it

1064
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,200
forever

1065
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:19,619
Donna s says I was on a carnivore diet

1066
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,960
keto diet for years and that's when I

1067
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,000
got so sick Donna or people who did the

1068
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,740
carnivore diet to the letter and died

1069
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,500
there are people who did the keto diet

1070
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,240
years ago to the letter and died

1071
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,040
the reason why is because they had no

1072
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,839
glucose to their brain anymore they

1073
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:38,720
followed it to the letter they didn't

1074
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,720
binge they stayed on it until they died

1075
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,400
people get some results at first when

1076
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,140
they cut out all the garbage in the

1077
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,000
processed foods and they do a mono diet

1078
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,560
of just meat by itself they feel like

1079
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,180
they have found the Panacea for five

1080
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,800
minutes and then it all goes downhill

1081
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,240
after that and they're on raw honey and

1082
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,099
then they're on berries and then they're

1083
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,319
redesigning their carnivore diet they're

1084
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,940
redesigning their keto diet what are

1085
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,099
they turning it into in the end they're

1086
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,099
turning it into the medical medium diets

1087
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,060
that's what's so crazy

1088
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,819
foreign

1089
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:19,040
but yet they make a lot of mistakes

1090
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:19,040
because they don't have all the details

1091
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,040
being starved of glucose for too long

1092
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:30,900
shrinks the brain it's one reason why

1093
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,300
millions and millions of Americans are

1094
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,300
suffering from brain issues

1095
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,300
as brains are degenerating and reducing

1096
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,900
in size those in the health movement

1097
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:47,220
should be saying whoa

1098
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:51,680
we need to get the diet truly right we

1099
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,680
need to get sugars back to the brain

1100
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,599
the brain's electricity does not run on

1101
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:59,599
fat it runs on sugar

1102
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,099
Cold Light spring and now people think

1103
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,780
your info was always out there it's

1104
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,940
insane

1105
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,319
yeah that's a that's actually a tactic

1106
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,720
and a strategy

1107
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,720
that's what they do like if I talk about

1108
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,060
all these incredible details about fat

1109
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,260
if they hear fat out there they'll just

1110
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,819
like oh wait that must have been out

1111
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,099
there because of the word fat like they

1112
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:25,140
don't even realize the concepts and the

1113
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,119
in the info and the details it's just

1114
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,460
that's a trick to get you not to listen

1115
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,740
to Medical medium information so they

1116
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,420
can steal it too there's people in the

1117
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,920
medical medium community that healed

1118
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,660
every illness in their medical meaning

1119
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,339
like with their medical medium

1120
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,440
information here right that they used

1121
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,720
right that was offered to them for free

1122
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,859
and they they used it and they healed

1123
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,020
everything

1124
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:48,540
and then

1125
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,460
but they want to steal it so then

1126
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,339
they'll say oh fruits and vegetables

1127
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,619
have always been around

1128
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:56,940
medical medium I I can just you know

1129
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:58,740
what forget it

1130
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,760
yeah I healed through medical media but

1131
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,260
now I'm going to go out there and say I

1132
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,400
didn't feel for medical medium I healed

1133
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,319
because I knew how to eat fruits and

1134
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,520
vegetables it's not that there are

1135
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,780
people who have been on fruits and

1136
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,740
vegetables but they have to find this

1137
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,740
information to heal

1138
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,200
it's interesting

1139
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,680
if you're listening to this live alone

1140
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:31,680
you know the info it's not out there

1141
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,020
there's so much intricate detail in this

1142
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,359
live right now in this moment

1143
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:39,119
it's a tremendous amount of details and

1144
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,940
it's intricate it's comprehensive just

1145
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,619
in this alone right here

1146
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,480
like all the books in the lives in the

1147
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,780
podcast right you guys know

1148
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,780
yeah

1149
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,079
the brains of electricity does not run

1150
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,880
on fat it runs on sugars too much fat

1151
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,760
actually gets in the way of the brain's

1152
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,300
electrical grid system fatty brains make

1153
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,980
electrical grid system go

1154
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,780
overheat and cause problems

1155
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,359
foreign

1156
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,460
this is why only a small percentage of

1157
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:11,819
fat naturally occurs in a healthy brain

1158
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,339
glucose helps reduce heat and keep brain

1159
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:16,619
tissue cool this is why someone would

1160
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:17,640
someone with toxic heavy metals in the

1161
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,680
brain

1162
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,940
causing a condition such as bipolar

1163
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,619
because you know in the books if you've

1164
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,060
read the brand saver books or heard

1165
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:27,540
medical meme information throughout the

1166
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:29,579
years you know that Metals create the

1167
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,619
bipolar diagnosis in the end when

1168
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:34,920
someone's up down up and

1169
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:37,220
and they get a diagnosis of that

1170
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,220
foreign

1171
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,220
this is why someone with toxic heavy

1172
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,460
metals in the brain causing a condition

1173
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:47,339
such as bipolar often has such a strong

1174
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:51,619
sugar craving people with

1175
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:56,160
that diagnosis of bipolar have a really

1176
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:57,900
craving craving craving to sugar

1177
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,880
with the increased heat from the toxic

1178
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,339
heavy metals the brain's own adaptive

1179
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,020
cooling nature is diminished plus excess

1180
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,819
fat in the long term can lead to

1181
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,920
unhealthy fatty tissue in the brain

1182
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:09,240
which increases brain heat what this is

1183
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,920
saying is more fat in your brain the

1184
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,800
more brain Heat

1185
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,260
when that happens the brain which again

1186
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,180
is formed from glycogen starts to

1187
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,099
shrivel up and break down as fat

1188
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,260
increases and builds up so more fat

1189
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,900
builds up in your brain your brain

1190
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,880
tissue starts to shrivel up more fat

1191
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,160
builds up in your brain your brain

1192
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,079
tissue starts to shrivel up you end up

1193
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,859
with more fat in your brain and less

1194
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,859
brain tissue

1195
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,740
taking what's the the brain taking

1196
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,660
what was the brain tissue space so your

1197
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,140
brain shrinking but the fats taking over

1198
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:52,500
the space this is powerful information

1199
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,819
its brain is atrophying

1200
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,700
but yet

1201
00:51:53,819 --> 00:52:00,559
fat in and around the brain is taking up

1202
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,559
the space of where the brain was

1203
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,619
at the same time heavy metals oxidize

1204
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,500
and maladies such as Strokes Alzheimer's

1205
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,660
and Dementia can occur more easily fatty

1206
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,000
tissue buildup in the brain is not the

1207
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,520
same as someone being overweight just

1208
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,099
because someone is overweight

1209
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,079
doesn't mean they have a fatty brain and

1210
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,300
that's an that's interesting so that's

1211
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,400
clarification it's a detail that's

1212
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:33,920
important from above

1213
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,920
if they if they're eating healthily

1214
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,280
it doesn't mean that just because they

1215
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,240
have weight on them they have a fatty

1216
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,980
brain

1217
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,599
and just because someone isn't

1218
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,760
overweight doesn't mean their brain

1219
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,440
tissue is free from fatty deposits you

1220
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,640
could be thin and still have a fatty

1221
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,059
brain

1222
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,460
they could still have an unhealthy brain

1223
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:56,460
that contains large deposits of fat

1224
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:59,220
tissue whether someone is overweight or

1225
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,319
not with a low-fat diet and the

1226
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,760
healthiest foods there won't be this

1227
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:06,380
High increased

1228
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,380
fat tissue in the brain

1229
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,540
probably Wren says oh my God yes giving

1230
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,540
up fat helped me so much in overcoming

1231
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:18,900
my panic attacks and mood struggles

1232
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:22,800
right there on YouTube IG official card

1233
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:25,500
says I will be 51 tomorrow and look 30

1234
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,740
thanks to UAW congratulations on your

1235
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:31,339
birthday tomorrow amazing

1236
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,339
foreign

1237
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,240
going on a low carb diet for an extended

1238
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,079
time

1239
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:51,680
on YouTube Annabeth Lee maybe the people

1240
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,680
with light steel maybe the people

1241
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,819
with light steal it and then tell it to

1242
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,220
people

1243
00:53:56,819 --> 00:54:02,160
who will be saved so then the spreading

1244
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,900
of these info is taking good turn

1245
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,300
doesn't it question mark So what you're

1246
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,300
saying Annabeth is maybe people with

1247
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,280
light in them steal it and then they

1248
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,680
tell it to other people who will be then

1249
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,960
saved so then the spreading of this

1250
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,079
information is taking a good turn

1251
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:22,319
doesn't it is that the question Annabeth

1252
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:25,020
no because here's what goes wrong they

1253
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,059
don't cite back the source so it becomes

1254
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,920
just a bit and a piece

1255
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,119
and then that one bit in the piece isn't

1256
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,740
enough because you're still going to do

1257
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,119
all these other things that are going to

1258
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,520
tip their scale

1259
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,900
they're still going to stay sick because

1260
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,940
they don't have enough of the

1261
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,099
information from the original Source

1262
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,720
it's not being cited back to the

1263
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:44,720
original source is what's happening

1264
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,960
it's really bad for people who are

1265
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,460
trying to heal and who are chronically

1266
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,260
ill it's like

1267
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,760
you're out there you're looking for an

1268
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,140
answer you're on your hands and knees

1269
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,660
you're praying to God even if you didn't

1270
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,220
even believe in God to begin with since

1271
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,720
a lot of people they turn to God when

1272
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,579
they're at The Darkest Hour when they

1273
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,859
weren't even God fearing or believing

1274
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,180
God anyway and they're just on their

1275
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:13,319
hands and knees they're praying to God

1276
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,720
and they're like I don't have any other

1277
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,540
options I'm using hope I lost this I

1278
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,819
lost my job my loved one left me I have

1279
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,400
all these problems I can't pay these

1280
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:25,260
doctor bills I'm so sick I've tried all

1281
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,760
the alternative medicine hacks I could

1282
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,319
possibly find I've been to functional

1283
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,700
medicine doctors I've been a herbalist

1284
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,680
I've been to Chinese medicine doctors

1285
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,420
I've been acupuncturist I've been to

1286
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,760
Do's I've been to naturopaths I've been

1287
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,819
to herbalists I've been to shamanic

1288
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,740
healers I've been everywhere I've tried

1289
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:43,200
Ayahuasca now that's my only like

1290
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,800
leftover thing I can possibly do is just

1291
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,540
just Blitz my brain out with Ayahuasca

1292
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,420
and I don't know where to go anymore

1293
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,460
because I have now 50 symptoms and

1294
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,319
building and people don't know really

1295
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,300
what's wrong with me I'm told I created

1296
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:59,160
it with my thoughts I'm hold my bodies

1297
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,020
attacking itself I'm told I'm a bad

1298
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,599
person and I just need to rewire my

1299
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,339
brain I've tried everything under the

1300
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,940
Sun including meditations and everything

1301
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:10,680
else and I am just sick and I don't know

1302
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,660
what to do and I'm at my darkest hour

1303
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,900
and I'm at my darkest point in my life

1304
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,760
and then if you find a tidbit that was

1305
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,040
shared somewhere for medical medium

1306
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,559
information but not cited back to all

1307
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,660
the incredible things you can do and the

1308
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,720
info to learn and know what it's about

1309
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:29,099
so you can heal and grow you just get a

1310
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,680
tidbit you're gonna like oh that's

1311
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:34,980
interesting I'll try that at the same

1312
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,559
time I'll try that wild blueberry I'll

1313
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,260
take my charcoal that this other person

1314
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:42,059
said to take or the same time I'm having

1315
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,960
my wild blueberry for medical medium

1316
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,000
that I don't know it's for medical

1317
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,460
meaning info because it was never cited

1318
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,900
back to you know him I'll take my wild

1319
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,540
blueberry thing

1320
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,000
eat my wild blueberries and I'll also

1321
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,819
take my Pearl powder my ionizer water

1322
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,700
which is poisoning the brain uh my

1323
00:56:56,819 --> 00:57:01,319
charcoal my shilajit that cost like a

1324
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,640
hundred dollars for just a little speck

1325
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:04,559
of it which doesn't do anything for

1326
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,079
anybody and I'll just do all this stuff

1327
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,900
and it's just endless

1328
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,059
but what happens is that people steal

1329
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,400
the info to make them look like they

1330
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,839
know more that's why they do it too out

1331
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,220
there they don't want to cite it back to

1332
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,319
medical meaning because they want to

1333
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,780
steal it so they look like they know

1334
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:24,180
something because that's what happens

1335
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,559
the podcast doctors are stealing so much

1336
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,780
info from here because they don't have

1337
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,280
any info of their own so they're taking

1338
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,380
it and then it makes them look like

1339
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,119
they're really smart and so they can say

1340
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:37,400
these few talking points and then people

1341
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:40,619
go oh my God Epstein-Barr wait a minute

1342
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,880
uh Metals toxic heavy metals and it

1343
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,260
makes them look like they really know

1344
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,819
what they're talking about but they

1345
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,380
don't and then you just can't get

1346
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:48,359
anywhere then they talk bad about

1347
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,300
medical medium on their on the same time

1348
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:53,700
oh reliable source says medical meme

1349
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,619
information should not be trusted a

1350
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,839
reliable source says medical medium

1351
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:00,180
shouldn't be trusted that's a real a

1352
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,700
reliable source says this

1353
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,380
no we're gonna steal his info and use it

1354
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:07,380
but we're gonna step on him on at the

1355
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,680
same time and then the person if they're

1356
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,900
told it's medical medium to begin with

1357
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,940
right they may be like oh that person

1358
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,260
said reliable sources to stay away from

1359
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,140
medical medium so they can't get help

1360
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,760
that way anyway or if they use the mm

1361
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,859
info

1362
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,359
and they don't even cite back the source

1363
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:26,160
the person's gonna never know where to

1364
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:28,200
go to get help it's endless it's like

1365
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,540
whatever

1366
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,099
I mean that's one way to that's just one

1367
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,099
angle of it there's so many different

1368
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:37,619
aspects of how it's all done now

1369
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:40,319
why should I even care

1370
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:42,299
well Spirit of compassion told me when I

1371
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,460
was younger you have to care

1372
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:46,079
you have to care about the suffering and

1373
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,059
the people who are really really

1374
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,040
struggling you have to care about the

1375
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:52,680
people who can't find an answer

1376
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,299
I remember when I was a little boy and I

1377
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,740
said the spirit of compassion I don't

1378
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:58,260
care

1379
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:00,720
I just want to ride my bicycle

1380
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,280
I want to just grab a fishing rod and go

1381
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,260
to the pond

1382
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,059
and I don't want to know about what's

1383
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,079
inside somebody's body and I don't want

1384
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:10,079
to know

1385
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:12,480
why someone's suffering because I'm six

1386
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,059
years old and I can't be bothered with

1387
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,920
this right now and SOC said to me I'd

1388
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:19,260
better care and I better learn how to

1389
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,059
care fast

1390
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,059
and I never forgot that lesson

1391
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,160
because Spirit of compassion told me

1392
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,460
this you don't understand Anthony when

1393
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,460
someone

1394
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,599
their health goes down hell

1395
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,799
it's everything to them and I was

1396
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,720
listening as a little boy and I said

1397
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:41,760
what do you mean it's everything to them

1398
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,319
and spiritual passion said to me you

1399
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,119
don't get it you're not in their shoes

1400
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:47,160
so you're not going to understand it

1401
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,319
you're not going to understand what it's

1402
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,660
like when you've been to 12 doctors and

1403
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:54,359
15 doctors

1404
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:56,819
and you're really sick and you're almost

1405
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:59,579
bedridden and no one has an answer

1406
00:59:56,819 --> 01:00:01,319
and SOC said Anthony you don't

1407
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:03,900
understand what that is you have to

1408
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:08,339
learn what that is because that is

1409
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:10,099
everything so you have to care and so I

1410
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,900
spent my life

1411
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,940
connecting to that and so when people

1412
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,160
don't cite something back that could

1413
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,619
save their life to the original source

1414
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,960
of the info or they steal it to just

1415
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:25,380
make it look like they know better

1416
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:29,280
to get some followers or to sell

1417
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:32,660
programs it's sad

1418
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,660
it's just really sad

1419
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,460
instead if they gave the original credit

1420
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:41,880
to Medical medium information and stop

1421
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:44,220
talking crap to tear mm down and people

1422
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,619
would get what they need but the evil

1423
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,020
tactic of stealing info and then trying

1424
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:51,420
to talk bad about medical medium keeps a

1425
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:54,559
lot of people from healing and even

1426
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,559
trusting the information

1427
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,640
well well we need to have time for that

1428
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:03,359
one and I need energy shifter it's

1429
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,880

baby's brain developing all of it

1435
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:21,119
there's so much info in this book I

1436
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,920
can't even scratch the surface

1437
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,020

[Music]

1449
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:12,200
this part coming up is insane

1450
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:12,200
it's about Trace mineral salts

1451
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,339
this is incredible information right

1452
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:20,160
here there's this one section here I'll

1453
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:22,140
read this one little section right here

1454
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,240
trace minerals are not just physical

1455
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:27,480
tangible minerals

1456
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,780
like in the food right trace minerals

1457
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,960
have connected to everything above us

1458
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:37,640
beyond the Earth our atmosphere is

1459
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,640
filled with trace minerals

1460
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:43,380
outer space is filled with trace

1461
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:46,260
minerals I'm on page 414 of brain saver

1462
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:49,200
this is wait to hear this

1463
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,299
this is incredible

1464
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,579
everybody thinks trace minerals is just

1465
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:54,780
something that's like in

1466
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:56,220
a food

1467
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,460
when they hear it when they learn about

1468
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:01,740
trace minerals being inside of food

1469
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:06,000
so there's macro minerals inside food

1470
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:07,740
there's trace minerals inside food okay

1471
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,200
so they think well that's trace minerals

1472
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,720
inside water there's macro minerals

1473
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,339
inside there's solids inside water right

1474
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,319
you have solids inside water you have

1475
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:18,660
macro minerals inside water you have

1476
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:22,140
trace minerals inside water it's part of

1477
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:24,119
the solid group inside water

1478
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,760
trace minerals are not just physical

1479
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:30,000
tangible minerals they have a Godly

1480
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,700
presence so a trace mineral isn't just a

1481
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,619
tangible like metal because that's what

1482
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,920
these are mineral Metals they're

1483
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,920
different

1484
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:41,819
trace minerals are not just physical

1485
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,099
tangible minerals they have a Godly

1486
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:46,260
presence

1487
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:48,119
trace minerals have connected to

1488
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:51,599
everything above us

1489
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:54,240
beyond the Earth our atmosphere fear is

1490
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:58,099
filled with trace minerals outer space

1491
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,099
is filled with trace minerals

1492
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:04,500
trace minerals can be dead or trace

1493
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,079
minerals can be alive and active

1494
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,900
the frequencies and signals that come

1495
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:12,420
down from the universe

1496
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,000
on the bridge that neurotransmitter

1497
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,099
chemicals are extending stimulate

1498
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,720
activate and ignite trace minerals

1499
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:22,200
inside our brain

1500
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,480
into life giving them in order and a

1501
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,520
direction to directly attach themselves

1502
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,260
to neurons and restore neurotransmitter

1503
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,640
chemicals so this is talking about how

1504
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,180
Trace Metals work that are in our

1505
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,180
atmosphere

1506
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:37,799
they're all around us it's incredible

1507
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,900
Rumble

1508
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:42,000
see

1509
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:45,660
Michael Drew

1510
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,780
medical medium was The Missing Link

1511
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:50,520
that I was searching for for years

1512
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,559
incredible

1513
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,319
hey guys let's make an energy shifter

1514
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:58,400
let's do it I'm bringing it to the

1515
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,400
energy shifter right now

1516
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,579
I'm in brain saver

1517
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:09,240
let's do it foreign

1518
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:11,780
I have the energy shifter earlier

1519
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:16,099
before coming on

1520
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,099
I think I'm going to do that more often

1521
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,339
is what I think I'm going to do

1522
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:26,640
Carson says this is why healing is such

1523
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:28,680
a spiritual experience once you start

1524
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,319
getting enough trace minerals you truly

1525
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:34,859
feel connected to something higher truly

1526
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:37,859
one and Powerful amazing reason

1527
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:40,440
so energy shifter use the shot when

1528
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:42,119
energetic strength is required for

1529
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,319

1553
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,700
use this shot when removing caffeine

1554
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,859
from your life

01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,880
if you're gonna dump the caffeine like

if you're going to be like you know what

1557
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,339

anymore

1559
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:55,440
I don't want to be in Chains to keep

1560
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:58,500
chains that caffeine industry just puts

1561
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,839
us in I don't want to be the caffeine

1562
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:03,119
industry is statistic

1563
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:07,500
I don't want to be like

1564
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:09,240
the caffeine industry's marketing point

1565
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,319
you should read the caffeine chapter in

1566
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,280
these books

1567
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,280

01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,500
from your life

1570
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:21,119
use this shot when you want to wind down

1571
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,880
at the end of the day so you can

1572
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,420
recalibrate rest and retire for the

1573
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,420
night

1574
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:36,599
the energy shifter is also ideal for

1575
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,059
overactive or underactive adrenals that

1576
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,859
are exhausted from excessive adrenal

1577
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,020
output which

1578
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:44,220
I mean come on let's just be honest and

1579
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,079
face it

1580
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,400

1581
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,559
lives and what's happening in the world

it's easy to just like be burning

1583
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:57,000
adrenaline and burning adrenaline

1584
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,539
use the inner shifter energy shifter

1585
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,400
if low blood sugar

1586
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:06,000
hypoglycemia is occurring

1587
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,160
Sensations such as edginess exhaustion

1588
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,380
feeling emotional for unexplained

1589
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,000
reasons

1590
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,859
like does that ever happen to you guys

1591
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,339
where you feel emotional for unexplained

1592
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:19,440
reasons

1593
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:22,500
use this energy shifter if you feel

1594
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:25,679
emotional for unexplained reasons or

1595
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,060
starting to get triggered easily

1596
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,199
so if you're starting to get triggered

1597
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:31,699

01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:43,100
so let's get this rolling

1663
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,159
that's right

1664
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,460
almost tricked myself

1665
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:06,420
it's got some carrot in there first

1666
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,420
foreign

1667
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:13,440
carrot juice the reason why

1668
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:16,500
is because people like would do just

1669
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,540
carrot juice right they'd buy carrot

1670
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,100
juice gallons of carrot juice it's rid

1671
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,719
of compassion said it was never a great

1672
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,040
idea this is different it's a small

1673
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:24,780
amount of carrot juice mixed in with

1674
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,060
everything else

1675
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,260
make sure whatever you're using that's

1676
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:31,460
frozen

1677
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,460
is thawed out

1678
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,659
make sure it's thaw because if it's not

1679
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:38,340
thawed and it's still frozen it's not

1680
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:40,800
going to create any juice you're just

1681
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,640
gonna have ice cream

1682
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,440
foreign

1683
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,239
so make sure you do that that's

1684
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,920
important to know keep that in mind all

1685
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:48,239
right all right so there's some carrots

1686
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,100
in there

1687
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,140
now we're gonna head to raw sweet

1688
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:55,100
potatoes

1689
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,100
nice

1690
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:03,679
I'm really happy you guys like this

1691
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,679
drink

1692
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,159
I'm very happy

1693
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:12,540
the one thing about the one thing you

1694
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,400
have to realize is this is a synergistic

1695
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:17,400
combination

1696
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:20,520
of wild Foods herbs

1697
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,860
fruits vegetables leafy greens right

1698
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,600
done done in a way that no one would

1699
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,699
know it's from above the reason why

1700
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,699
these have an instant hit

1701
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:31,260
and Sensations and results that happen

1702
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:33,900
for people

1703
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,820
the reason for it is because it's

1704
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,560
information from above signs of research

1705
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,480
does not know alternative medicine does

1706
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,540
not know that it's exactly the

1707
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:45,659
phytochemical compounds that come from

1708
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:47,219
this specific group in the amounts that

1709
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:49,020
makes a difference in somebody's life

1710
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:53,460
and that's what's incredible about the

1711
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:56,699
mm info right it's not beholding to

1712
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:58,860
bad ideas that are out there it's not to

1713
01:13:56,699 --> 01:14:01,500
hold into that it's free from that it's

1714
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:03,239
from above so it's free from all of that

1715
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,380
which is really incredible okay let's

1716
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,380
get some pineapple in here

1717
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:12,659
nice

1718
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,640
now I'm using Frozen pineapple I'm just

1719
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:17,640
letting you know

1720
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,800
I defrosted it so it's defrosted so keep

1721
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:24,800
that in mind

1722
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,800
okay put a little bit more in here

1723
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,699
nice

1724
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:36,980
amazing

1725
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,980
now what I do is

1726
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,860
give it a little time to get through

1727
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,679
because what you're doing is you're

1728
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:47,840
saving money with this juicer

1729
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,840
because the pulp comes out so dry

1730
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,020
now what I notice when people juice

1731
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:57,600
carrots with other juicers it's sloppy

1732
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:58,800
wet and you need bags and bags of

1733
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,659
carrots

1734
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,640
and you don't need that with this it's

1735
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:04,440
incredible

1736
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:08,340
it's why I endorse this machine this is

1737
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:09,900
the mm-1500 the mm900 1500 are amazing

1738
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,460
this is the one with the full

1739
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,140
Nutritional Center and everything it's a

1740
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:16,280
mega check it out link is in the

1741
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,280
description link is in the profile

1742
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,280
so to get this much juice comparatively

1743
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,780
what I noticed with all the other

1744
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,260
juicers that I've been through this just

1745
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:33,360
to get this much I would have to use

1746
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:36,480
loads of produce that's not an

1747
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,000
exaggeration I would have to put a lot

1748
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,920
of carrots in a lot of sweet potato a

1749
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,380
lot of bell pepper to get even that much

1750
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,739
juice and that's where people are saving

1751
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:49,739
money and that's critical

1752
01:15:45,739 --> 01:15:50,940
food costs are going up every day

1753
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,900
you're going up every day I'm going to

1754
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,060
save this because I'm going to make

1755
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,219
another energy shifter later I love

1756
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,199
knowing that I'm saving produce I could

1757
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,960
do more energy shifters for less money

1758
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:03,300
you know when you're buying produce

1759
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,880
so it's incredible

1760
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,260
it's less wasteful everybody's you know

1761
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,719
always worried about waste and stuff

1762
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:12,679
well it's less wasteful how amazing and

1763
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,679
what you'll notice is

1764
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:18,179
that's dry pulp it's so much drier than

1765
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,580
the other machines so you're not

1766
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:22,980
throwing your produce out the window and

1767
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:25,440
that's what's incredible about it

1768
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:27,960
and people say well juicing you know

1769
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,640
you're wasting this you poop this out

1770
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,320
you would poop this out if you ate a

1771
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,400
carrot it would just go out in the

1772
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,040
toilet

1773
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,420
so people don't realize that you know

1774
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,380
and I talked about that many times you

1775
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,540
guys know

1776
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,159
but I'm not going to bring the poops out

1777
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:43,739
today because that's what I've always

1778
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:45,480
done when we talked about this is I

1779
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:48,300
bring the poops out I'm not going to

1780
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:51,000
bring the poops out although every part

1781
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,820
of me wants to run to the other room

1782
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,620
where I have a lot of props and go grab

1783
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,880
the plate of poop but I'm not gonna do

1784
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:59,340
it

1785
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,340
wait a minute who said that poop was a

1786
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:04,920
prop that was real poop from my friends

1787
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,890
that we dehydrated and I'm using as a

1788
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:12,979
prop all right

time the energy shifter

1798
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,840
I'm not gonna lie

1799
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:52,280
I drink a lot of the energy sifters

1800
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,780
because what I do is something that I

1801
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:59,340
don't think other people should do is

1802
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:01,020
they push themselves past their

1803
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,840
limitations

1804
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,790
and then I use medical medium tools

1805
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:10,500

lot of silly stuff so I don't know

Mr William we put a little bit of some

1841
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:48,540
psychedelics in this energy shifter I

hope you're okay with that I I don't

1843
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,840
want any psychedelics in my energy

01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:48,239
psychiatrist

1910
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:51,060

have to realize that

1942
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:15,600
um

1943
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:19,400
Dr Nesbitt says

1944
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,400
ask your doctor what's right for you

1945
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,760
he says ask your doctor what's right for

1946
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,380
you should Dr Nesbit say he doesn't

1947
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,560
believe in any of this hogwash he called

1948
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,560
it

1949
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:32,340

1952
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:41,219
although Dr Nesbitt did have

1953
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,900
a trauma shock and loss stabilizer

1954
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:45,420

01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:58,340
energy off the chain like the

01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,340
battery bunny

1961
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,260
Dr Nesbitt says how dare you talk about

1962
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:08,100
the Energizer Bunny which is a personal

1963
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:11,820
friend of Dr nesbit's Dr Nesbitt did a

1964
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:14,159
surgery on the Energizer Bunny

1965
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:16,440
if the Bashir says the energy shot is

1966
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:18,239
one of my favorite tasting drinks

1967
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,340
Dr Nesbitt

1968
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:23,040

1971
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,620
just Dr Nesbitt he doesn't know what

1972
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:32,480
he's thinking right now because he's Dr

1973
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:32,480
Nesbitt had a few too many vodkas

1974
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,960
Tiffany shacklett says I quit coffee

1975
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,960
after your podcast

1976
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:45,500
Dr Nesbitt says

1978
01:25:45,659 --> 01:25:49,860

1979
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:53,340

1981
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:56,760
yes

1982
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,900
no no one should be drinking coffee

1983
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,440
really

1984
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,440
yeah

1985
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:04,320
Pilots

1986
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,420
Dr Nesbitt

1987
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,120
when you're on a plane you want your

1988
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:12,120
pilot to drink coffee

1989
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,980
um yeah but if your pilot needs to drink

1990
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:16,560
coffee then your pilot's not feeling

1991
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:19,020
well to begin with and doesn't have any

1992
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,719
energy or Clarity and he needs coffee to

1993
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:24,679
make he or she clear and that's kind of

1994
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,679
scary all on its own

1995
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:29,460
