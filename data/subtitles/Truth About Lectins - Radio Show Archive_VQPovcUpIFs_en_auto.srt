decades ahead of what's out there now as

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,079
I've always said who has 10 or 20 years

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,040
to wait for answers for their illnesses

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,920
people have waited so many years in

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,840
literally sick for so many years without

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,960
having answers to heal people who have

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,079

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,920
wait anymore they got the answers they

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,480
they live good lives after that because

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,879
of it they've been healed since they

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,079

22
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,520
information out there that's all

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,600
scrambled eggs on the Internet or in

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,160
other books because they know what

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
healed them they know what to stick to

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,320
and they don't get thwarted or confused

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,280
when they see other stuff going around

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,040
like lectin like the whole lectin thing

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,840
the whole lectin Theory and the whole

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,159
lectin blunder that people are trying to

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,080
hang their hat on unbelievable and so

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799

with the whole thing with with medical

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,799
research and science is that medical

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,320
research and science still ignores what

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,119
causes chronic illness today still

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,720
ignores what's C causing chronic illness

39
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,759
this is on purpose so it trinkles down

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,799
to the alternative movement too where we

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,640
just ignore the truth of what causes

42
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,320
illnesses in people all the different

43
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,119
autoimmune diseases all the different

44
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,880
symptoms and conditions all the mystery

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
of all of it in the thyroid healing book

46
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,000
I talked about over a hundred symptoms

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439
and conditions and I talked about what

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,479
the real cause is but they don't even

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,880
have answers to the simplest aches and

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,560
pains to the simplest with the simplest

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,880
tingles and numbness to the simplest

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,360

there's an answer for it I mean we have

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,720
the answers here but that's how it works

57
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:11,560
it's unbelievable the lectin theory the

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,879
letin theory is unbelievable and I'm

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,879
going to talk about why so you can be

60
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,000
careful so you don't cheat yourself out

61
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,840
of a healing process because if you want

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,120
to go on a wild goose chase along with

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
the last 50,000 Wild Goose chases that

64
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,400

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,920
one which is the lectin fear and you

want to hop on into that that wild goose

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,480
chase and you want to keep on going with

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
that you're going to be stuck in the

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
same place you started from a long time

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920

struggles that may have come your

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,759
way but you're inherently a good person

186
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,720
deep inside you're a good person but the

187
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,280
one thing you can't do is park your car

188
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,199
good you really stink at it you really

189
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,520
stink at it you never hurt

190
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,039
anybody you never heard anybody parking

191
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,919
your car nothing ever happened and if it

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
did who

193
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,479
cares who cares if you bumped into

194
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
somebody else's car but you don't even

195
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,400
do that you just don't park good you're

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
not known to be a good Parker so you

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
going know back up the car and you're

198
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,479
like oo I can't parallel park this is

199
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
really hard you're you're you're 2 feet

200
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,440
away from the curb you're 3 feet away

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,199
from the curb and you're

202
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,080
trying and word gets

203
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,000
around word gets around rumor goes

204
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,800
around

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,400
town you're a terrible

206
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,479
Parker and then it goes from there to

207
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
something else you're just a bad person

208
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
Rumor Has It

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,199
you're just horrible you hurt

210
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,199
people and rumor has it it's even worse

211
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,599
than that you you all of a sudden rumor

212
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,680
has it where you just don't even have a

213
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,800
place in the

214
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,680
community you can't even get a part-time

215
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,360
job because no one wants to take you on

216
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,240
because of rumors because you're

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
electing you're

218
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,360
electing even though the community in

219
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,720
the town all has it

220
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
confused even though you're inherently a

221
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,560
great person a good Soul a good person a

222
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,879
good being you don't mean any harm to

223
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
anybody you didn't cause any harm to

224
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,599
anybody didn't cause any harm to anybody

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,599
at all somehow a rumor kind of took

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,159
off and you're considered bad all around

227
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,800
bad all around so all the good that

228
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,879
you've ever done helping

229
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,639
others all the good you've ever done

230
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,400
when you washed When you washed your

231
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,159
friend's daughter's

232
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,759
knee when she got when when she scraped

233
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,080
the cement from her when she fell off

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,039
her skateboard and you and you actually

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,039
made sure you you clean the

236
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,800
wound and you put the Band-Aid

237
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,560
on and her mommy who was a friend of

238
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,240
yours was just so grateful that you did

239
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,600
that and you did that all that gets just

240
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,800
thrown thrown away like it didn't

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,560
exist or the time where you were

242
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,800
listening to a

243
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,800
friend and friend was spilling all her

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
pain and sorrow and everything and you

245
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,920
truly had compassion and were listening

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,240
and wanted to help in any way you

247
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,200
could you said look you can stay over

248
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,640
here at our house sometimes or whatever

249
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
if you need to and all that disappears

250
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,920
everything good you've ever done just

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,720
gone

252
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,680
gone everything good you've ever done

253
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,440
for anyone and

254
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,399
anything even the things that nobody

255
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,920
even knows about that you've done how

256
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,519
about that the things that the things

257
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,040
that you've done for people that nobody

258
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,839
really even knows

259
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,880
about the neighbor every you know the

260
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,760
neighbor every time a paper the Sunday

261
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,160
paper comes and the and they leave the

262
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,360
paper in the street versus in the

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,560
driveway you're up earlier so you get

264
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,240
out there and you actually pick it out

265
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,640
of the street and you put it in your

266
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,800
neighbor's driveway by their

267
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
mailbox or just in their driveway

268
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,920
whatever and no one ever knew because

269
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,320
you just it was just small stuff you

270
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,480
just didn't bother saying anything just

271
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,480
small gestures of caring about anything

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,600
or doing anything but they're important

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,640
they're important

274
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
and you know even to bigger things but

275
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,760
all thrown away because a rumor has it

276
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,120
you're a bad person you're toxic you do

277
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,720
nothing but wrong and it all started

278
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,560
from just not being a great Parker and

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,399
just somehow it took off in all the

280
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
wrong

281
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,519
directions because yeah because you're

282
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,839
electing is what it turns out to you

283
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,959
actually are electing and that's just

284
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,959
one example of what I'm even saying now

285
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,320
I don't know if you're catching on yet

286
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,720
some of you might be already know where

287
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm going but I'm going there let I just

288
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,959
want to say something for decades

289
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,399
medical research and science has been

290
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,959
purposely developing toxic harmful

291
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,360
theories to explain the causes of all

292
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:48,079
your illnesses symptoms and

293
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,639
conditions which is to them a mystery

294
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
which is to them a mystery so research

295
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,959
and science has been trying to create

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,560
all these reasons why we're sick we're

297
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,440
sick and they've been doing it for

298
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,920
decades and decades okay it all started

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,120
with it's all in your head that's why we

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,720
were sick it's all in your head that's

301
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,160
where it all started from it's all in

302
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,720
your head you're crazy women are crazy

303
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,440
you're crazy if you got some symptoms

304
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,680
that are unexplainable in research and

305
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,600
Science and the doctor doesn't know what

306
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,440
it is you're crazy that's how it all

307
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,839
started then it went to hormones

308
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,240
everything's hormones now it's all your

309
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,519
hormones hormones is why you're sick

310
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,120
everybody's sick everybody's sick

311
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,360
because of their hormones that's that's

312
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,320
why they're sick they're only sick

313
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,680
because of their hormones it went to

314
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,600
that and then it went to the autoimmune

315
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,200
Theory the autoimmune Theory where the

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,639
body is attacking itself and destroying

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
itself attacking healthy cells and

318
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,519
healthy tissue your immune system is

319
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,279
attacking healthy tissue because they

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,959
can't explain what's really going on so

321
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,000
they name everything autoimmune which is

322
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,760
your body attacking itself which I did a

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
whole chapter in thyroid healing if you

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,720
want to know all the details in that the

325
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,480
body does not attack itself on any level

326
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,680
the theory was misguided to believe to

327
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,360
begin with it was funded and backed by a

328
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,839
lot of money and interest groups they

329
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,120
had to come up with a theory they fought

330
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,800
with a bunch of different theories they

331
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,519
didn't have they didn't have real real

332
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,120
documented information or studies but

333
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,680
they went with the autoimmune Theory it

334
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,600
was the best way to protect the medical

335
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,000
establishment because what it was was if

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,839
the medical establishment doesn't know

337
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,440
what's wrong with you they need you to

338
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,639
be the Fall Guy they need you to be the

339
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Fall Guy so that's where it went

340
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,399
then okay and it's not the body

341
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,000
attacking itself it's pathogens

342
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
attacking the body I talk about it in

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
the book I talk about it on the radio

344
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,920
shows you know that now

345
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,160
and your body's building antibodies to

346
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,079
go after the pathogen the virus or or

347
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,839
different variety of viruses or whatever

348
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,680
going after the pathogen not your

349
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
healthy cells the pathogens go after the

350
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,160
healthy cells so that was nobody still

351
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,320
knows that by the way nobody not even

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,920
the best lectin experts even know that

353
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,720
now they don't even know that it's

354
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,000
incredible not even the best the best

355
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,040
immunology immunologists even know that

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,880
right now because somebody hung their

357
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,800
hat on a theory they had to actually pay

358
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,839
for and grandfather in and make it law

359
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,720
so you lose so you lose these laws that

360
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,560
are made make it so you lose that's

361
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,680
right you lose it doesn't feel good

362
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,760
losing but everybody keeps on losing and

363
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,199
losing and losing it's

364
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,560
unbelievable then it went to it got spun

365
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,480
into some different directions you

366
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,880
create your own illness you create your

367
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,600
sickness so that's what happened there

368
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,959
it's going into that direction by people

369
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,480
who who aren't sick and don't have any

370
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,920
answers for people who are sick and they

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
get kind of spiritual and they're like

372
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,320
oh you created it you created it you're

373
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,160
creating it you're just you're not

374
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,680
spiritually aligned you're creating it

375
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
then it went to that whole thing that's

376
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,120
pretty recent actually that's really

377
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,920
recent I wrote about that too you know

378
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,040
that's really A demented one and

379
00:13:51,920 --> 00:14:00,079
then then it's gone to Foods Foods

380
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,360
causing your illness food Foods okay

381
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
that's interesting that's kind of an

382
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,279
alternative twist it it is led into not

383
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,800
bad right Foods causing your illness

384
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,839
causing your

385
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,079
inflammation Foods don't cause

386
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,240
inflammation oh dear

387
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:20,519
lord it's unbelievable where we are

388
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,839
today and the stupidity that we still

389
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,680
were the place that we're at is

390
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,560
unreal Foods don't cause

391
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,000
inflammation till this day nobody knows

392
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,240
in research and science alternative or

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,120
conventional that there's that food

394
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:45,399
feeds a virus which then for fuels

395
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,079
itself releasing a poison or causing a

396
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,360
direct attack upon the cells inside the

397
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,720
body until this day research and science

398
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
still don't even know not even the best

399
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,240
people in the business the best top

400
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,279
doctors you can find out there or

401
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,759
so-called the best people in the

402
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,560
industry still don't even know that

403
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,240
viruses eat food they actually

404
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,440
eat they actually consume through their

405
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,399
cell membrane they actually absorb food

406
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,480
fuel themselves feed and eat and

407
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,000
eliminate like any species they still

408
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,880
don't know

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,800
this so food doesn't cause inflammation

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,079
on any

411
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,839
level this is why people without

412
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,279
pathogens inside their body live to be

413
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,120
90 years old they didn't have any

414
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,519
autoimmune they live fine they exercised

415
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,480
their whole life everything was great

416
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,199
sure they cause they got other problems

417
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,120
going on they got heart disease finally

418
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,600
by the time they were 88 years old but

419
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
you know that's expected with all their

420
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,079
high fat consumptions of foods they've

421
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,160
been eating the high fat diets and

422
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,279
clogging up their arteries and

423
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,839
everything like that of course of course

424
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,759
and if they did get a cancer yeah

425
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,959
because cancers are from viruses viruses

426
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:59,160
create cancers viruses feed off of

427
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,160
foods but

428
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,519
none of that's really known I mean it's

429
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,079
known out there that a virus can create

430
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,000
cancer that that is known out

431
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:14,279
there but what's not is a virus feeds

432
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,680
off of food and then creates the problem

433
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,360
not the food not the food and in the

434
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,319
best sit the best areas of level of

435
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
knowledge that we have and alternative

436
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,279
and conventional the best experts on the

437
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,880
circuits I don't care where they are

438
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,120
still don't even know that still don't

439
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,000
even know

440
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,680
that they don't even believe

441
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,680
that so that's the next place it's gone

442
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:44,440
so with that comes a new Theory with

443
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,680
that comes a new Theory so the lectin

444
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,000
theory eltin

445
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,560
theory is said to believe it's a car

446
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,319
carbohydrate binding protein eltin it's

447
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,040
in all fruits and

448
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,360
vegetables like legumes and nuts and

449
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
everything and some grains and and all

450
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,760
ingrains and it's the reason for illness

451
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,760
today it's the reason for why we're sick

452
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,559
today unbelievable arrogance un

453
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,240
incredible entitlement incredible

454
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,319
entitlement like you you guys you guys

455
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,120
you have to understand what this really

456
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,640
means and what this is this is to push

457
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,400
aside

458
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,959
everything that we need to look for in

459
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,960
order to get people truly healed in the

460
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,919
future and just throw it away and push

461
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,400
it aside that's what this is so somebody

462
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,400
and people can hang their hat

463
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,120
now on this new Theory this popular

464
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,760
Trend that's on the rise is the concern

465
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,640
that certain foods are high in lectin

466
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,000
and therefore have a negative effect on

467
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,360
the health you have to understand that

468
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,559
for decades there have been chronically

469
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
sick people and for decades to come

470
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,039
there will be chronically sick people

471
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,240
please know that there's going to be

472
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,280
chronically sick people for decades and

473
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,080
decades to come without the right

474
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,200
information not because of lectin when

475
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,880
someone knows what's wrong with her or

476
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,000
his body knows what's causing a symptom

477
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,480
or condition and knows how to heal it

478
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,919
she or he can heal it over dozens of

479
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,919
years I've witnessed tens of thousands

480
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,919
of people do just this you guys recover

481
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,640
their health even from the most

482
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,080
devastating conditions these recoveries

483
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,120
had nothing to do with lectin

484
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,600
concern I've witnessed tens of thousands

485
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,919
of people healing and recovering

486
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,200
throughout the 35 more than 35 years I

487
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,200
have helped people with devastating

488
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,559
conditions and these

489
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,480
recoveries had nothing to do with

490
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,559
lectin we can't live in a bubble where

491
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,760
we believe that the that nobody got

492
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,799
better from what ailed them until the

493
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,039
lectin trend just came along until the

494
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,440
lectin train Trend just just came along

495
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,200
choo choo into

496
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,159
the you know right down the

497
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,200
tracks we can't just put a blind eye

498
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,080
that people never healed from chronic

499
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,440
illness before the lectin trend came

500
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,120
along the promoters of lectin literature

501
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,679
and Studies have been completely in the

502
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
dark about the thousands and thousands

503
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,440
of people who've healed without their

504
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,600
trendy misinformation about

505
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,039
lectin it's as if it's if it it's as if

506
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,360
they've ignored people's healing because

507
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,159
it didn't fit into their box of what

508
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,240
they

509
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,039
believed it didn't fit into their trendy

510
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,600
box and whatever their belief system was

511
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,120
so they just ignored the amount of

512
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,720
people that have

513
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,120
healed without any electing concern or

514
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,960
fear along the

515
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,480
way right they pretend that no one has

516
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,640
ever healed from chronic illness at all

517
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
in fact you can just bring somebody to

518
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,600
some of these lectin people and say well

519
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,360
this person healed from chronic illness

520
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,240
doing this and they won't even

521
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,520
care that won't even even be thrown into

522
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,200
a study it won't even be thrown into a

523
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,760
possibility of checking a study it won't

524
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,159
meaning to actually to actually be used

525
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,360
as leverage it won't even be thrown it

526
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,440
that person would be crazy if they

527
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,120
healed that means they were never sick

528
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,080
they were crazy that's what that meant

529
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,520
that's what that means unless it falls

530
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,760
into lectin and our lectin studies and

531
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,240
our lectin propaganda and our lectin

532
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,880
literature unless you were part of the

533
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,720
whole lectin thing you never healed from

534
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,840
your chronic illness they pretend no one

535
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,000
has ever healed from chronic illness so

536
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,559
that they can build the lectin Empire

537
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,280
you don't think there's a lectin Empire

538
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,080
there's lectin Empires out there

539
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,200
building see all you're going to hear it

540
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,120
is the next few three four five years

541
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,520
non-stop Le and Le is all you're going

542
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,200
to hear and guess what sure people can

543
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:59,679
remove processed foods with lectin in

544
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,440
them people can remove processed foods

545
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,520
people can go on trendy high fat high

546
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,799
protein diets with no sugar in them for

547
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,720
a little while and if they really

548
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,720
weren't that sick and didn't have too

549
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,120
many problems and has few sniffles and

550
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,279
maybe nak in a pain they'll probably

551
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,840
feel better but you take people that

552
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,520
have real neurological mystery

553
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,440
conditions by the millions that are out

554
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,880
there and you want to play that game

555
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,600
they don't get better they end up going

556
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,120
around looking around another place to

557
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,000
heal going around looking around for

558
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,440
another place to heal and keep on going

559
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,880
around yep whether it's lime disease

560
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,919
whether it's real ra whether it's you

561
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,840
know Hashimoto whether it's just they

562
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,279
keep on going around cuz the Hashimoto

563
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,840
creeps back in when you're on those

564
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:39,679
high-fat diets those there's trendy

565
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,400
high-fat diets that are anti- sugar and

566
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,919
it creeps back in and they come back

567
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,840
around again three more years later

568
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,559
they're sick again five more years later

569
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,440
they're sick again where's the lectin

570
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,919
going to get you there then you it goes

571
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,679
on and on and on and on this is a prime

572
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
example like I said before I repeat it

573
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,039
again of entitled ignorance the problem

574
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,159
with lectin concern is that it removes

575
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:04,039
foods that would actually stop the

576
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:08,039
viruses and the other pathogens in your

577
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:10,880
body that truly cause symptoms and

578
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,799
disease did you hear that did you hear

579
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,279
that the problem is with the lectin

580
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,000
concern is that it removes bodies that

581
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,000
would actually heal you because they

582
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,039
stop viruses and pathogens they have

583
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,240
other things in

584
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
them these Foods might not be able to

585
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,320
park a car good and they might spread a

586
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,039
bad rumor like how bad a tomato is it

587
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,559
might spread because it's a night shade

588
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,200
oh oh it might spread a

589
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
rumor but it could actually heal you and

590
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,000
stop

591
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
viruses it might not be able to park its

592
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,559
car good that rumor might go around and

593
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,520
ruin all of its good just like it did

594
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,760
that Mom where all the good she's ever

595
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,440
done is thrown out the window thrown out

596
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,520
the window because someone didn't like

597
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
the way she parked her car they watched

598
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,400
it they watched it and then they texted

599
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,559
somebody and spread a rumor

600
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,520
saying this mom is no good as a person

601
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,440
and it ran around town somehow and

602
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,760
nobody knew how it really developed and

603
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,400
where it came

604
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,320
from well that's the whole lectin thing

605
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,679
that's like a

606
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,159
tomato or a potato which stops

607
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,000
viruses being blamed for all the real

608
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,360
good it does because it actually stops

609
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,880
real disease the real chronic illness

610
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,760
that's out there it actually stops it

611
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,640
because because just like the potato it

612
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,720
has high amounts of available Eline a

613
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,000
kind that no other food actually Harbors

614
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,880
or has that actually stops the Epstein

615
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,520
bar virus from causing chronic fatigue

616
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,799
fibromyalgia Hashimoto thyroiditis and

617
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,480
multiple sclerosis and the list goes on

618
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:47,200
the list goes

619
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,880
on but it's going to be packaged as a

620
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,000
bad food for somebody to hang their hat

621
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,360
on because it's an easy cell cuz people

622
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,480
be like oh oh carbohydrate that's bad oh

623
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,760
oh potato that's bad wait a minute sweet

624
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,200
potato oh you got to look out

625
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,520
out you got to look out and it's an easy

626
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,240
cell because we're suckers in the end

627
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,000
we're all suckers because it's easy to

628
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,520
be a sucker when you don't know what's

629
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
going on in science and research is

630
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,640
keeping everybody in the dark to someone

631
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,440
can come along and want to hang their

632
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,880
hat on something and build an Empire off

633
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
it in two seconds flat and you'll be

634
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,840
suckered into it that'll be one more

635
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320
decade

636
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,960
wasted so the prime example of entitled

637
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,520
ignorance is the problem is first of all

638
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,039
you don't recognize that so many people

639
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,760
have healed I've seen lives saved with

640
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,159
the potato literally saved even

641
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,880
recently

642
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,840
recently not even just years ago

643
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,600
recently where they couldn't eat

644
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,279
anything at all it was the only thing

645
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,279
they could eat to recover their Linings

646
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,840
of their intestinal tract from being

647
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,480
burned out by food poisoning and burned

648
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,960
out by other problems and adrenaline and

649
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,200
everything else that people don't even

650
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
understand how it works in the gut

651
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,679
nobody knows what goes on in the gut you

652
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,520
can give all the research and science

653
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,039
about nobody knows what's going on in

654
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,880
there because remember interest groups

655
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,240
back each study that they're looking for

656
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,919
and if there isn't an outcome to to

657
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,080
soothe the Beast of the investors to

658
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,799
sooe the investors you have to

659
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,440
understand this there's an investor

660
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,080
behind any

661
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:24,440
study and so if an expert gets funded to

662
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,520
create a study it has to have an outcome

663
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,000
that's positive or they will never be

664
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,520
invested in again you need to understand

665
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,919
the the this the the level of what that

666
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:39,360
is in which that is you need to know

667
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,840
what that is it's real and that means an

668
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,360
outcome's going to come out no matter

669
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,720
who likes it who doesn't like it as long

670
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,520
as it fits

671
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,360
in to some narrative so you need to know

672
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,960
this so prime example is not is for

673
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,600
ignoring people that have healed

674
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,200
removing foods that actually stop

675
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
viruses and pathogens that are being

676
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,240
ignored

677
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,080
by

678
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,880
arrogant people in the

679
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,960
industry that cause real symptoms and

680
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,600
disease lectin

681
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,840
leaders don't know about these pathogens

682
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,880
like Epstein bar they don't know the RO

683
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,120
role in causing conditions and illnesses

684
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,880
such as Epstein bar and the true which

685
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,799
is the true cause of rheumatoid

686
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,520
arthritis they would rather think a

687
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,600
potato is causing somebody's ra than

688
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,440
discover the truth

689
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,159
that the cheese or the butter or the

690
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,000
milk in potato mashed

691
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,880
potatoes is actually feeding a virus not

692
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,760
the potato itself they wouldn't they

693
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,880
don't want to know that it's actually

694
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,679
feeding a virus causing more

695
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,000
ra you take that out the butter and you

696
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,919
take out that you take out that lard and

697
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,080
grease from a hash brown and you take

698
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,640
out that butter from from you know off

699
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,399
your potato and the cheese off your

700
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,039
potato the very foods that feed

701
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,840
pathogens and you just have a steamed

702
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,600
potato you have a good chance to heal

703
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,799
your

704
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,080
ra because of what I was talking about

705
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,080
earlier about the bioavailable LI scene

706
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,960
involved that stops the Epstein bar

707
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,520
virus from causing ra first of all letin

708
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,440
leaders don't even know ra is caused by

709
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,039
Epstein bar or any kind of pathogen or

710
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,559
virus they think the body's attacking

711
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,960
itself and destroying itself and then

712
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,799
they think a food is causing it I can't

713
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,799
tell you how remedial that is I can't

714
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,559
tell you how basically stupid that is I

715
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,360
can't even tell you to where we are

716
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,200
today in this day and age that we would

717
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,720
even be there still now today that we

718
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,240
would even be here with that kind of

719
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,159
unbelievable Joker ISM like it is

720
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,559
incredible they'd rather believe that

721
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:48,360
autoimmune is the immune system

722
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
attacking the body's own cells and

723
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,320
destroying itself since they don't

724
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,679
understand that what the autoimmune

725
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,240
theory that what it really is and how

726
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,039
it's inaccurate they don't understand

727
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,200
that they have nowhere else to turn

728
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,440
besides blaming it on

729
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,679
lectin and you know how important it is

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,200
for somebody in their career to hang

731
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,039
their hat on something you know how

732
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,519
important that is it means everything it

733
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,840
means everything okay hang your hat on

734
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,840
something doesn't matter if it's going

735
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,320
to hurt people harm people stop people

736
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,960
from getting better if you can hang your

737
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,080
hat on something that's what matters

738
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,080
creates your legacy right hang your hat

739
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,600
on something oh that's your

740
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,880
legacy that's how it

741
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,640
works all right

742
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,039
and that's how people get wrapped up

743
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,559
into the wrong

744
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,519
direction believing in part that lectin

745
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,440
are a problem because to supposedly

746
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,360
confuse the body and cause it to turn

747
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,720
against itself so okay lectin are the

748
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,360
reason the body's are turning against

749
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,399
itself first of all the body never turns

750
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,799
against itself it can't turn against

751
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:49,480
itself no lectin can make the body turn

752
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,080
against itself nor can anything else

753
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,279
make the body turn against

754
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,960
itself a virus actually infects the

755
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,600
body creating the inflammation your body

756
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,760
creates an

757
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,000
antibody whether it's discovered or Not

758
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,399
by research and science because there's

759
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,720
so many different antibodies that not

760
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,640
not even discovered that the body

761
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,919
creates to go after the pathogen and

762
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,559
destroy it but only the pathogen itself

763
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,159
this is Advanced information I'm giving

764
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,919
you that doesn't exist out there

765
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,760
Advanced information it's how I've

766
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,120
gotten people to heal and still get

767
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,080
people to heal I put it in my books I've

768
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,640
worked with people oneon-one for

769
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,399
decades and so we're still back in

770
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,919
stupidity land I mean I have to say I

771
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,240
hate saying that word but it's that

772
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,559
bad so they believe that the lectin are

773
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,399
the problem because they supposedly

774
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,760
confuse the body and cause it to turn

775
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,000
against itself while they remove the

776
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,120
foods that can help you heal such as

777
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,919
fruits and certain vegetables roots and

778
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:55,320
tubers leading you to eat more fats that

779
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,480
actually not only harm you but help feed

780
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,120
the pathogens because they put you you

781
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,080
on these really high-fat diets cuz

782
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,480
they're so sugar feared they're so s

783
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,279
such in fear of sugar they put you on

784
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,600
these high-fat

785
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,279
diets because they think oh wait wait a

786
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,720
minute this is that's what they put you

787
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,880
on and guess what that does it destroys

788
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,799
your liver it destroys your liver and

789
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,519
and and whether it's a they they all put

790
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,159
you on the high animal protein diets but

791
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,559
just say you want to be plant-based and

792
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,080
follow their law You' have to be on tons

793
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,640
and tons of of fats on a plant-based

794
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,640
diet too which doesn't help your

795
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,640
liver but understand this all The lectin

796
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,880
Advocates and leaders and study grp and

797
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,000
and and the people behind all the

798
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,039
studies all these years they're anti-

799
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,080
plant-based

800
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:52,640
movement I'm not anti- plant-based

801
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,679
movement I'm not anti- whatever animal

802
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,600
protein movement but I'm not anti-

803
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,760
plant-based movement they're an there's

804
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,000
a bias there's a bias nature to it all

805
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,919
they're anti fruit to begin

806
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,240
with so you have to understand EV

807
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,639
everybody involved in the lectin world

808
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,039
the anti-lectin

809
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,320
world everybody involved are all anti

810
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,919
fruit to begin with they all bought into

811
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,639
either the keto way or the high protein

812
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,600
way they're totally against all

813
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:27,240
plant-based modalities

814
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,360
whatsoever and they're totally against

815
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,799
fruit they're anti fruit to begin with

816
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,240
so the whole thing is built with a bias

817
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,799
against fruit itself do you know what

818
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
that means you know what that means when

819
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,279
you do a study it means you have a

820
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,720
belief system already set in place and

821
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,200
then you get funded for that belief

822
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,799
system so of course it's going to come

823
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,360
out in the way it's going to come out

824
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,840
because guess what it can't go any other

825
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,480
way especially when you don't even

826
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,960
believe in Fruit when you think somebody

827
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,799
shouldn't even be eating fruit because

828
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,200
of the sugar and fruit don't even

829
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,919
understand that fruits help heal dis

830
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,120
disease they help heal the liver they

831
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,760
help reverse disease in every way

832
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,279
possible that's how it

833
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,279
works so they end up removing the foods

834
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,880
that heal you sure you might get

835
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,919
temporarily results they take you off a

836
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,840
processed food because it's not lectins

837
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,120
and wheat it's another protein that

838
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,200
actually causes problems and I'll tell

839
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:25,559
you what it causes it feeds a virus

840
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,320
lectins don't feed viruses but certain

841
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:31,200
other types of protein and certain other

842
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,080
types of phytochemicals that are

843
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,320
actually in

844
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,360
wheat can feed a virus they don't even

845
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,799
know that they're so far removed from

846
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,559
even researching that because your mind

847
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,840
is shut and closed for so many reasons

848
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,480
we just talked about throughout this

849
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,799
whole show not even understanding that

850
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,480
people have healed from chronic illness

851
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,440
without their eltin their phony eltin

852
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,000
belief

853
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,679
systems

854
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,880
so they put you on these high fat diets

855
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
and they get rid of all fruit all

856
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
together together the very thing that

857
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
helps heal your liver and bring it back

858
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,080
and guess what's in your liver viruses

859
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,200
viruses that don't even know about

860
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,799
viruses that sit inside the liver that

861
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
the experts don't even know about that

862
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,679
science and research aren't even aware

863
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,120
about that sit there and those are the

864
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,399
viruses that create inflammation and

865
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,039
create chronic illness with all the

866
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:19,039
illnesses and autoimmune diseases that

867
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,440
we

868
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,880
have the lectin and fruits and

869
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,279
vegetables do not harm us I repeat the

870
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,360
lectin in fruits and vegetables do not

871
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,320
harm us please don't let any Source

872
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,720
confuse you into thinking that lectins

873
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,760
are like the toxic alkaloids produced as

874
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,440
a defense mechanism by some wild plant

875
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,240
not fit for human consumption let me go

876
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,480
into that a little

877
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,919
bit there are chotes and twigs in other

878
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,120
plants where if a deer takes a bite a

879
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,880
deer in the wild takes a bite alkaloids

880
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,240
will surface to repel that deer in other

881
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,960
animals and insects from damaging it

882
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,000
further I repeat

883
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,159
alkaloids not

884
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
lectins alkaloids because what they

885
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,760
throw at you they try to throw this

886
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,200
other bogus piece of science too they

887
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,919
try to say that well lectins what

888
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,079
happens is when you're picking your

889
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,320
vegetables and your

890
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,800
fruits and you know whether they're in

891
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,320
the wild or in your garden that the

892
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,720
plant build a defense mechanism to stop

893
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,960
you from eating

894
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,960
them that's what that's what the that's

895
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,520
what the argument is it's it's easy to

896
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,480
buy into it it's really great you know

897
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,440
what that's going to do it's going to

898
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,599
stop you from eating your fruits and

899
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,119
vegetables and other foods that could

900
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,159
really help you it's going to stop you

901
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,040
from doing that so then you can buy into

902
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,119
the whole lectin thing and you'll end up

903
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,919
sick anyway in 10 years because it's not

904
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,839
the it's not what does it and gets rid

905
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,440
of the viruses the very thing we talk

906
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,359
about in the books and here on the radio

907
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,359
show is to get people

908
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:57,200
better it's a sad sad day when I have to

909
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:00,720
I have to put out information to help

910
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,520
clear the ear the air and actually help

911
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,520
balance things back out again it's

912
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,560
amazing how things work so what happens

913
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,680
is is in the wild when a deer eats some

914
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,119
leaves off of a chute or a root that

915
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,000
came out of the I mean a chute that came

916
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,359
out of the

917
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,040
ground okay or it ate it ate some

918
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,640
leaves off of a young a

919
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,920
sapling it bit it bit some Twigs off of

920
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,839
some Maples the maple will re release an

921
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,480
enzyme an enzyme and an alkaloid to the

922
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:37,839
surface to protect the tree from the

923
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,960
deer that is not what our garden variety

924
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,760
vegetables and fruits and wild edibles

925
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,640
such as wild blueberries or other wild

926
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,200
herbs that we use like red clover and

927
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,839
everything else has that doesn't exist

928
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,240
for human consumption humans can eat and

929
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,520
choose to eat these there's a reason why

930
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,119
these foods are on the planet and

931
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,359
there's a reason why we grow them and

932
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,920
it's a reason why we eat them and it's

933
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,680
why they're here too and the fruits are

934
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,400
on the trees naturally and here God

935
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,040
given for us to actually heal and grow

936
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,119
and feed

937
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,200
ourselves it's

938
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:15,560
different because a deer and a wild

939
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,680
animal also has an enzyme in their mouth

940
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,319
that

941
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,680
triggers a wild twig a wild plant a

942
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:27,960
sapling like for instance an

943
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,920
alder or a baby maple or whatever kind

944
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,520
of plant or just you know a wild herb

945
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,839
coming out of the ground and so what

946
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,319
happens is when that deer comes along

947
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,119
and a deer bites this enzymes are

948
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,800
released that the enzymes come out of

949
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,760
the deer's mouth onto it it triggers

950
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,480
these alkaloids to surface that doesn't

951
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,440
exist with us when we grow green beans

952
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,560
out of our garden when we grow um

953
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,839
tomatoes out of our garden none of that

954
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,040
exists this is such a disaster of how

955
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,160
they can just spin everything it's

956
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,000
amazing just spin it all spin it all to

957
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,480
keep people from getting to where they

958
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,880
need to go and where they need to do

959
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,240
there are shoots and twigs and other

960
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,839
plants where if a deer takes a bite

961
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,520
alkaloids will surface to repel that

962
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,040
deer and other animal and insects from

963
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,280
damaging it further they're triggered

964
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,720
off by a deer's enzymes in a deer's

965
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,400
mouth we already don't eat those Foods

966
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,520
we don't eat those types of foods

967
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,920
they're toxic to us we already know

968
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,200
you're not supposed to eat the very

969
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,680
Foods in the wild that have these

970
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,440
alcohol IDs that now experts try to

971
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,520
trick us and say oh they're electons

972
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,880
this just how you can throw anything out

973
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,200
there anything out there you want to

974
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,880
confuse people believe me that's what

975
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,240
they do I know so you can do it you do

976
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,160
it you do it I watch it all day long out

977
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,960
there because they're backed by bias

978
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,359
studies interest groups interest money

979
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,839
investors investors somebody puts a half

980
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,359
a million dollars into something you

981
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,440
better have an outcome and the person

982
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,240
who who you know sold it to them to get

983
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,960
the money who has a belief system and

984
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,359
who's anti- fruit better be delivering

985
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,119
some kind of information to them even if

986
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,839
it means don't look at everything else

987
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,359
even it means ignore everything else

988
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,319
even if it means ignore how many people

989
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,560
have healed otherwise even if you would

990
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:16,560
ever that's how it

991
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,560
works so we already don't eat those

992
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,560
foods that are in the wild because

993
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,560
they're toxic to us and lectin aren't

994
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,400
even what makes them a problem Garden

995
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,200
variety fruits and veg vegetables and

996
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,920
even the wild plants we know to be

997
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,200
edible like I talked about before are in

998
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,720
a whole different category they're not

999
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,480
triggered we don't have an enzyme from a

1000
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,440
deer inside of us a deer that and yet

1001
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,200
they're being lumped together with

1002
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,920
problematic alkaloid containing plants

1003
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,040
again the lectins and the foods we eat

1004
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,480
do not cause harm the lectins and the

1005
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,119
foods we eat do not cause

1006
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,240
harm there are certain proteins that

1007
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,119
aren't in fruits and vegetables and are

1008
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,079
in items such as da eggs and certain

1009
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,240
grains like wheat and they do feed

1010
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,200
pathogens and people don't understand

1011
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,240
that part alone that part like there is

1012
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,680
worth the price of

1013
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,599
admission is worth the price of

1014
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,280
admission that alone what I mean by

1015
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,079
price of admission I mean you don't have

1016
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,560
to pay a price I'm just saying if you're

1017
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,200
going to go to a you know if you're

1018
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,480
going to go out and see a a movie and

1019
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,240
you're going to pay so much for a ticket

1020
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,800
hopefully it's worth a price of that

1021
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:33,000
ticket this alone is worth everything

1022
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,880
knowing that there's certain proteins in

1023
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,119
dairies Dairy and eggs and other

1024
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,680
phytochemicals undiscovered by research

1025
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,079
and science that feed

1026
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,480
pathogens viruses and bacteria that are

1027
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,160
creating the inflammation and guess what

1028
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,960
you guys lectins aren't one of them

1029
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,119
lectins are not one of them there are

1030
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,359
dozens of proteins and compounds and

1031
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,839
dairy and egg and Wheats and wheat for

1032
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,640
experts to hang dozens and dozens of

1033
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,520
hats on in their quest to alleviate

1034
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,160
chronic illness and yet they try to hang

1035
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,119
their hat on just one that's not even

1036
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,960
the problem they try to hang their hat

1037
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,800
on the lectin one it's utterly

1038
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,720
ridiculous be concerned about

1039
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,680
gluten-rich Foods absolutely and don't

1040
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,800
be but don't be afraid about potatoes

1041
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,800
and ripe Tomatoes I've watched them heal

1042
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,200
the sickest people as I said before

1043
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,200
saving even lives look out for

1044
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,400
anti-lectin sediment and be ious about

1045
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,680
buying into it this trendy mistake is

1046
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,240
going to continue for quite a long time

1047
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,040
it's here to stay because money has been

1048
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,319
invested into

1049
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,520
it so don't let it confuse you or

1050
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,480
confuse the bear with healing into the

1051
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,079
future it's another anti-f fruit

1052
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,839
campaign you have to know that they're

1053
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,200
going to hit the fruit in any way they

1054
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,720
can because the minute you gain a little

1055
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,079
power and you use the fear of The

1056
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,040
Nightshade of the Tomato which I'm going

1057
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,119
to talk about in a little while

1058
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,960
minute you grab that you can then if

1059
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,880
you're anti- fruit in general outside of

1060
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,000
a handful of berries if you're anti

1061
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,720
fruit in

1062
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,280
general you can you know you you then

1063
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,839
can use that you can wave that power

1064
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,319
once you have people's attention you can

1065
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,520
you can harness that power and be like

1066
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:13,880
yeah well you shouldn't be eating other

1067
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,359
fruits either because of all the sugar

1068
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,200
and everything else and whatnot and

1069
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,000
people be like whoa you must know what

1070
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,599
you're talking

1071
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,800
about so look it's another anti- fruit

1072
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,280
campaign another bias design to stop you

1073
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,280
from eating the fruits that heal your

1074
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,000
body and you're

1075
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,960
another excuse for medical research and

1076
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,599
science is lack of knowledge about what

1077
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,119
causes chronic

1078
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:39,200
illness please don't let it Rob you or

1079
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,520
your children of what you need to heal

1080
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,960
along the

1081
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:49,359
way see this as a beacon of light honest

1082
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,319
to God see it as a beacon of light today

1083
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,240
whatever you

1084
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,280
do it's really important see it is a

1085
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,920
beacon of light so let's talk about a

1086
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,720
little bit more

1087
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,240
about about about all of this are you

1088
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,040
guys hanging are you hanging with me are

1089
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,520
you with me you got some herbal tea with

1090
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,960
you so I hope so I hope so okay so how

1091
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,400
does this whole thing work in in other

1092
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,839
ways let's talk about some other stuff

1093
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,319
let's clear some other different things

1094
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,240
going on with all of this um okay let's

1095
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,839
go into the banana let's go into the

1096
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,880
banana fruit fear people anti-lectin

1097
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:27,240
people they don't like a ripe banana

1098
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,800
because they don't like ripe bananas

1099
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,160
because of because of sugar because

1100
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,119
they're concerned about sugar the only

1101
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,880
way to eat a banana is ripe you don't

1102
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,400
want it overripe but you don't want it

1103
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,839
under rpe it's the only way to eat one

1104
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,119
bananas have the ability when they're in

1105
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:46,680
their ripe stage to stop literally HIV

1106
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,280
the retrovirus

1107
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,559
HIV that's they can repel the retrovirus

1108
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,119
HIV they also have antiviral properties

1109
00:42:53,559 --> 00:43:01,160
that that are incredible they've healed

1110
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:04,520
kill people with colitis colitis severe

1111
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,359
severe colitis ulcerative colitis

1112
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,319
hemorrhaging just hemorrhaging blood

1113
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:11,720
vessels bananas I've seen bananas turn

1114
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,599
people around with colitis because

1115
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,400
colius is viral not the body attacking

1116
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,599
itself here's a prime example of a

1117
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
mistake going on it's thrown into the

1118
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,640
autoimmune disease category because

1119
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,960
science research have no idea anything

1120
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,119
about it lectin people don't know

1121
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,319
anything about colitis they don't know

1122
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,280
anything about any autoimmune disease

1123
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,720
they don't the best lectin doctors don't

1124
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,800
know anything about best lectin

1125
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,119
scientists don't know anything about

1126
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,359
autoimmune disease of course not if they

1127
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,520
did they wouldn't know what it was they

1128
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:39,480
don't know what it is with colitis it's

1129
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,119
a virus and that virus sits inside the

1130
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,280
uh colon and it sits in the Linings of

1131
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,680
the colon and if you feed it the wrong

1132
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,119
Foods yes it eats and they don't know

1133
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,920
that either it eats and it eats the

1134
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,280
wrong Foods it'll eat dairy it'll eat

1135
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,720
eggs it'll eat like the other things I

1136
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,359
talked about that are in wheat and other

1137
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,160
grains and stuff like that it'll eat

1138
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,240
that

1139
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:04,440
and but when you put banana in it helps

1140
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:07,280
kill off the virus antiviral properties

1141
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,960
but lectin experts love to do the ripe

1142
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,480
the unripe banana the green banana I

1143
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,839
can't tell you how

1144
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,559
destructive that is to the intestinal

1145
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,000
tract a g solid rock hard green banana

1146
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:23,359
I'm just going to tell you right now

1147
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,119
unripe is so hard to digest so hard to

1148
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:30,079
digest it's unbelievable that's that and

1149
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,680
and but yet they like that as an option

1150
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,480
because they're so afraid of sugar

1151
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,520
because it hasn't it hasn't developed

1152
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,200
its sugars yet so they like taking the

1153
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,599
skin off don't do the don't do that

1154
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,480
green banana thing it's a way to really

1155
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,440
irritate your gut

1156
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,040
Linings because that's that's what

1157
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,359
happens when it's unripe like that you

1158
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,760
can't do that but when it's ripe it

1159
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:50,839
heals your gut Linings that's how it

1160
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,480
works this is just just a simple mistake

1161
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,880
already just a I mean it's not even

1162
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,760
simple it's a ridiculous mistake already

1163
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,079
being made out of the fruit fear out of

1164
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,760
the fear of sugar out of the fear of

1165
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,079
fruit causing harm it's

1166
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,240
unbelievable bananas soothe the

1167
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:09,359
intestinal tract lining they bring down

1168
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,160
inflammation do you know how by actually

1169
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:16,520
stopping pathogens that are causing

1170
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,559
inflammation so they bring down the

1171
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:23,319
inflammation I've seen bananas save

1172
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,559
lives over the years severe Crohn's and

1173
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:28,520
Colitis cases I've had to put them on

1174
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:31,760
nothing but bananas and celery juice not

1175
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,640
celery celery juice and and bananas to

1176
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,480
recover them to stop them from getting

1177
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,760
their intestinal tracks cut

1178
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,839
out and save their

1179
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,839
lives and they're living their lives

1180
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:46,160
now okay but entitled arrogance in the

1181
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,800
industries and the leading experts out

1182
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,119
there who think lactans is the cause of

1183
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,040
everything would even think that existed

1184
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,640
even if it was put in front of their

1185
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,960
face because if it didn't fit into their

1186
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,400
reasoning no no no no the world's the

1187
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,079
world stops for lectins it's like okay

1188
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,520
no everybody's sick it's because of the

1189
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,480
lectin everybody's sick that's it's

1190
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,240
lectin that's what it is now that's what

1191
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,920
it is

1192
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,640
unbelievable

1193
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,160
Tomatoes Tomatoes stop cancer banana

1194
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,359
stop cancer too but Tomatoes stop cancer

1195
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,119
but they just don't stop cancer they got

1196
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,920
a vitamin C in it different than any

1197
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,800
vitamin C there is and let me tell you

1198
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,480
about the whole Nightshade thing to

1199
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,359
begin with

1200
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,640
Nightshade all that means is it may

1201
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:36,359
Blossom sometimes a Nightshade May

1202
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:40,119
blossom in the Night Under The

1203
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:43,240
Moonlight if the moon is strong enough

1204
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:46,599
and when it does that fruit Harbors a

1205
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:50,000
vitamin C that's stronger than any other

1206
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:53,079
vitamin C tomato vitamin C is very

1207
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,960
powerful it stops viruses and pathogens

1208
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,920
do you know why tomato got a bad wrap

1209
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,359
because it was always with v

1210
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Parmesan sauce you know it was the sauce

1211
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:07,440
with v parmesan it was it was the tomato

1212
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:10,319
sauce on just you know wheat pasta wheat

1213
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,559
pasta penet pasta tomato

1214
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:16,520
sauce it was you know it's it's it was

1215
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:19,480
it's on pizza with a gluten you a crust

1216
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,440
filled with gluten and oil and grease

1217
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,520
and

1218
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,920
cheese of course no one so many people

1219
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,000
over the years reported they reported

1220
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,800
that they had some kind of reaction when

1221
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,160
they had their Pizza this in the old

1222
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,559
days they had a reaction when they had

1223
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,800
their their their parmesan whatever that

1224
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:40,359
is with the sauce and everything their

1225
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,640
ravioli with the sauce and they the

1226
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:45,119
Tomato was always blamed on it because

1227
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,200
of a rumor spread about a tomato being a

1228
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,040
night shade so they were like well the

1229
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,680
cheese is in a night shade that's not a

1230
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,119
night shade that can't be hurting you um

1231
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,559
the Butter's not in a night shade that

1232
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,720
can't be hurting you meanwhile those are

1233
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,880
the things that are actually feeding the

1234
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,680
the viruses and pathogens to create your

1235
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,520
arthritis so but see how the bad wrap

1236
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,400
occurred it's amazing how the bad wrap

1237
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,440
happened so wait a minute so the the

1238
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,559
gluten in the crust that's not a night

1239
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,760
shade now we're all anti-gluten of

1240
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,880
course but this is how it got the wrap

1241
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,400
the bad wrap a fresh heirloom Ripe

1242
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,720
Tomato is so healing when it's thrown on

1243
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,000
top of a salad of

1244
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,520
spinach a little bit of

1245
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,440
avocado it's just an little squeeze of

1246
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,400
lime or lemon it is so healing there's

1247
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,119
nothing wrong with it and you know what

1248
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,040
it does it stops cancers it stops

1249
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,760
viruses it's loaded with minerals it's

1250
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,520
got a vitamin C to reverse disease it's

00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,160
good for the thyroid it's incredible for

1252
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,720
the liver and it's good for the gut and

1253
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,440
you don't have to do anything to that

1254
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:51,640
tomato to change it prime example prime

1255
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,280
example of how trendy traps work just

1256
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,280
don't get sucked into them whatever you

1257
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,760
do it's not worth it why am I fighting

1258
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,680
for this I'm not making money off of

1259
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,319
this it's not like I have a a lectin

1260
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,680
supplement company where I sell lectins

1261
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,319
and someone's anti-lectin out there with

1262
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,440
all their literature and all the

1263
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,280
different studies out there and now I'm

1264
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,920
like oh I better I better clean up this

1265
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,880
mess in order to sell my eltin

1266
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,559
supplement because if everybody's

1267
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,079
anti-lectin now I'm going to go out of

1268
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,960
business what do I what am I earning

1269
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,720
from this what am I getting from this

1270
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,240
what am I getting from this I know what

1271
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,760
the elcin people are getting from this

1272
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,079
they're getting money and they got and

1273
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,640

ago before they even learned about

1327
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,920
lectin so lectin experts and Advocates

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,400
didn't even know they didn't even know

1329
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,480

1332
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,920
movement when you listen to the fruit

the Leon world because you know there's

1339
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,599

even possible and I can't wait to go

1349
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,640

1350
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,359
chance have you checked out the thyroid

1351
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,400
book check it out um just came out

1352
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,559
pretty recently actually recently it's

1353
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,280

1354
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:33,000
out there check it out and uh you know

1355
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,559
you can help people there's o over a

1356
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,760
hundred symptoms and conditions inside

1357
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,000
that book I explain what the causes are

1358
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,880
and they're not

1359
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,680
lectin they're not lectin the real

1360
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,760
causes of over a hundred different

1361
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,680
symptoms and conditions like across the

1362
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,079
board you got a symptom it's probably in

1363
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,280
there and it's not Leck and caused okay

1364
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,599
so just know that there's so many things

1365
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,760
things people suffer with so many

1366
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,319
different illnesses and chronic

1367
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,960
illnesses and yes it's tricky because if

1368
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:05,160
you get rid of gluten you might feel

1369
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,760
better because guess what wheat

1370
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,960
something in wheat like the gluten does

1371
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,880
feed pathogens which which is why you're

1372
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,559
not feeling good don't get that confused

1373
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:20,079
with the lectin propaganda and rhetoric

1374
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:22,599
that's out there now to try to rob you

1375
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,720
of healing do not get that confused

1376
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,559
whatever you do and that's going to be

1377
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,839
that a big mistake in your healing

1378
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,720
process a big mistake look it's easy to

1379
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,920
fall prey for what's out there now with

1380
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,839
information years ago when the internet

1381
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,599
wasn't around very few books existed in

1382
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,200
the health movement and I had this

1383
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,359
Advanced information that I'm giving you

1384
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,480

1386
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,319
information that's in my books I had

1387
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:52,720
years ago same Advanced information and

1388
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,280
I was giving it to people and guess what

1389
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:58,760
they didn't have to fight through all

1390
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,480
the garbage that's out there and now

1391
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,240
that the garbage kept in growing growing

1392
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,839
growing like Spirit told me it would the

1393
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,799
fight's going to be harder and harder to
