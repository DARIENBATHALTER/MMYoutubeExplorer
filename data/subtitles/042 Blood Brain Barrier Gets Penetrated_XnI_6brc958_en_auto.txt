[1.28 - 7.68] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.28 - 10.20] with their health chances are whether
[7.68 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.20 - 17.52] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.36] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.52 - 25.84] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.36 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.84 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.48] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.60] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.60 - 45.16] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.20] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.16 - 50.40] Williams we're talking about the bloodb
[47.20 - 53.12] brain barrier the bloodb brain barrier
[50.40 - 56.04] has limitations and vulnerabilities it's
[53.12 - 59.48] only Geared for the small stuff not the
[56.04 - 63.24] big stuff the small stuff not all the
[59.48 - 65.00] poison and toxins environmental waste
[63.24 - 68.68] and so much that we're up against every
[65.00 - 71.32] day our human body is not geared for the
[68.68 - 74.48] levels of exposure we experience on this
[71.32 - 77.76] planet a bloodb brain barrier never
[74.48 - 80.44] anticipated the Industrial Revolution
[77.76 - 85.08] and the classified medical industry
[80.44 - 85.08] where pathogens dominate the
[85.88 - 91.80] revolution convincing us that our bloodb
[88.92 - 94.56] brain barrier can handle anything
[91.80 - 98.52] convincing us that our human body is
[94.56 - 100.04] equipped to handle anything is basically
[98.52 - 103.32] saying our human body is equipped to
[100.04 - 105.52] handle nuclear waste we're told in many
[103.32 - 108.08] ways that we created here on the planet
[105.52 - 111.36] so we should be able to handle it we
[108.08 - 114.04] created it we should be able to handle
[111.36 - 117.32] it our bloodb brain barrier should have
[114.04 - 120.60] no problem no problem at all protecting
[117.32 - 122.92] us against anything protect us against
[120.60 - 125.64] nuclear waste right or any kind of toxic
[122.92 - 125.64] material
[126.52 - 134.08] right Max
[129.76 - 137.32] Max put put the toxic barrels over there
[134.08 - 141.16] put the toxic barrels over there oh oh
[137.32 - 142.48] oh you spilled it you spilled it don't
[141.16 - 144.12] worry don't worry your bloodb brain
[142.48 - 146.96] barriers got you
[144.12 - 150.08] covered yeah yeah you don't need to
[146.96 - 152.04] shower that off just get back to work
[150.08 - 154.40] but our bloodb brain barriers take care
[152.04 - 158.64] of all that toxic
[154.40 - 161.28] waste no one I repeat no one is
[158.64 - 164.16] measuring the levels of toxins in our
[161.28 - 166.60] environment no one I know everybody
[164.16 - 168.84] thinks there is somebody I know
[166.60 - 170.52] everybody thinks there's an agency I
[168.84 - 174.40] know everybody thinks there's some kind
[170.52 - 176.52] of scientific body that it's all taken
[174.40 - 177.88] care of that's what we're taught we're
[176.52 - 180.48] taught that in
[177.88 - 183.04] school everybody's taught that that in
[180.48 - 185.64] college they're taught that at
[183.04 - 188.76] universities they're taught that in high
[185.64 - 193.24] schools they're taught that there's
[188.76 - 194.88] this Universal knowledge or knowing that
[193.24 - 196.76] everything's taken care of that
[194.88 - 197.92] everything's okay with the environment
[196.76 - 199.56] because
[197.92 - 202.00] surely
[199.56 - 204.80] surely no one wants to destroy the
[202.00 - 207.84] planet that we live on I mean
[204.80 - 209.92] surely but that's the problem nobody's
[207.84 - 212.36] really watching nobody's keeping keeping
[209.92 - 215.60] an eye on it and then there's the whole
[212.36 - 218.52] climate change thing climate change well
[215.60 - 221.84] that means in some way that somebody's
[218.52 - 223.56] watching over the planet right like all
[221.84 - 225.72] the pollution and the toxins and
[223.56 - 228.52] environmental waste it's all covered
[225.72 - 231.12] under climate change so if everybody's
[228.52 - 234.28] so worried about climate change then
[231.12 - 236.96] everybody must be monitoring some way
[234.28 - 239.40] somehow the destruction of the planet
[236.96 - 241.80] there has to be some science behind that
[239.40 - 244.20] there there has to be some body of
[241.80 - 247.00] government or body of science that's
[244.20 - 249.00] actually keeping an eye on all of this
[247.00 - 251.52] but that's where it's misleading there
[249.00 - 253.60] isn't on another note did you ever think
[251.52 - 255.36] about the whole global warming thing
[253.60 - 258.80] remember that's where it started it was
[255.36 - 261.52] global warming science was saying global
[258.80 - 264.40] warming we were taught in school that it
[261.52 - 267.56] was global warming but what happened to
[264.40 - 270.76] global warming the Earth isn't heating
[267.56 - 274.60] up anymore it's not warming up anymore
[270.76 - 277.92] we were taught and told that it was
[274.60 - 281.44] Ironclad solid to the
[277.92 - 283.88] core set in stone that it was global
[281.44 - 286.44] warming and suddenly it all changed
[283.88 - 289.12] that's it now it's climate change that
[286.44 - 292.96] means whatever happens it just falls
[289.12 - 294.72] under climate change but global warming
[292.96 - 297.08] don't even say that word anymore you
[294.72 - 300.60] don't get laughed at you got to just
[297.08 - 303.28] kind of like never even remember that
[300.60 - 307.24] phrase because science was
[303.28 - 310.12] wrong that's why and now climate change
[307.24 - 312.48] science is right but what about 10 years
[310.12 - 314.92] from now is science going to be wrong
[312.48 - 316.24] again because science isn't really right
[314.92 - 317.88] about anything because I'll tell you
[316.24 - 319.52] right now when it comes down to this
[317.88 - 321.56] nobody's really looking no one's
[319.52 - 325.20] monitoring it's just a bunch of Talking
[321.56 - 327.76] Heads that's what it is now it's not
[325.20 - 329.72] real science behind something actually
[327.76 - 332.60] trying to figure something out because
[329.72 - 334.52] no real science is watching over truly
[332.60 - 337.00] the toxic waste on this planet and the
[334.52 - 338.00] levels of the toxic waste they're not
[337.00 - 341.12] watching the
[338.00 - 343.24] Chemtrails as they're just falling down
[341.12 - 345.40] they're not monitoring or testing what
[343.24 - 347.32] the planes are releasing in the sky that
[345.40 - 350.88] are being dumped in our lakes rivers on
[347.32 - 353.96] our fields on our grass on our Lawns on
[350.88 - 356.48] our heads none of that is being
[353.96 - 359.88] monitored it's just
[356.48 - 362.36] Phantom I was always told by my source
[359.88 - 365.40] since I was younger that it's global
[362.36 - 369.08] cooling planets cooling down little bit
[365.40 - 372.40] at a time but cooling down one of the
[369.08 - 375.08] reasons is from the Chemtrails alone
[372.40 - 378.48] clouding up the sky blocking the
[375.08 - 381.08] Sun that part alone is cooling down the
[378.48 - 385.04] planet never mind other forms of toxic
[381.08 - 386.40] waste what about planet Mars planet Mars
[385.04 - 390.24] is
[386.40 - 394.24] freezing temperatures drop it gets real
[390.24 - 396.96] cold yeah because there was toxic waste
[394.24 - 399.72] on that planet through
[396.96 - 403.96] Wars that planet self-
[399.72 - 406.08] imploded basically lots of Wars lots of
[403.96 - 408.56] Destruction planet was
[406.08 - 411.00] annihilated toxins everywhere in the
[408.56 - 414.84] atmosphere and it just
[411.00 - 418.76] died absolutely just stopped and ceased
[414.84 - 420.76] and died Mars is dead Planet just
[418.76 - 423.68] starting to probably come back and
[420.76 - 426.48] spring back to life in some way after a
[423.68 - 428.72] very long period of time it's also a
[426.48 - 431.48] chil planet there might be some warm
[428.72 - 433.44] spots at different times just warm
[431.48 - 435.88] enough but it gets cold and the
[433.44 - 437.40] temperature drops after we destroy this
[435.88 - 440.48] planet at some
[437.40 - 442.32] point same thing's going to happen but
[440.48 - 444.52] what does it matter the bloodb brain
[442.32 - 446.16] barrier takes care of everything it
[444.52 - 449.48] stops everything from getting into our
[446.16 - 452.08] brain it protects us everything's okay
[449.48 - 454.04] hey hey you heard it out there don't
[452.08 - 455.96] worry it has to cross the bloodb brain
[454.04 - 457.68] barrier nothing can cross the bloodb
[455.96 - 460.92] brain barrier right that's what we're
[457.68 - 463.44] told so what does it all matter medical
[460.92 - 466.52] research and science medical
[463.44 - 469.40] Industries don't want to admit there are
[466.52 - 472.52] toxic heavy metals in everybody's brains
[469.40 - 475.36] they don't even want to entertain the
[472.52 - 477.84] idea and publicly known medical research
[475.36 - 479.96] and science they're in the infancy
[477.84 - 482.40] stages of just recognizing izing
[479.96 - 485.12] pathogens being responsible for chronic
[482.40 - 487.40] illness if they're that early in
[485.12 - 489.60] understanding chronic illness if they're
[487.40 - 491.20] at the beginning process of
[489.60 - 493.96] understanding pathogens being
[491.20 - 496.36] responsible for chronic illness barely
[493.96 - 499.00] at the beginning process then how
[496.36 - 501.72] advanced can they possibly be
[499.00 - 504.04] understanding our body's complexities or
[501.72 - 506.60] mechanisms such as the bloodb brain
[504.04 - 509.96] barrier our bloodb brain barrier was not
[506.60 - 512.24] meant to handle any of this we act like
[509.96 - 515.76] it's this impermeable substance this
[512.24 - 519.24] impermeable structure this wall that
[515.76 - 521.08] stops things that it has no limitations
[519.24 - 522.36] we're taught that no don't worry about
[521.08 - 524.36] it blood brain barriers got it all
[522.36 - 528.28] covered it can't get through there
[524.36 - 530.00] nuclear waste Industrial Waste solvents
[528.28 - 532.64] yeah solvents you're exposed to solvents
[530.00 - 536.44] every day and don't even know it toxic
[532.64 - 538.68] heavy metals all someone has to do is
[536.44 - 540.76] use the term bloodb brain barrier to
[538.68 - 543.52] make us feel feel like we're all warm
[540.76 - 545.80] and fuzzy and protected nothing could be
[543.52 - 549.60] wrong don't worry about that you got a
[545.80 - 551.32] bloodb brain barrier and yet the reality
[549.60 - 553.88] all these things and more passes through
[551.32 - 556.72] the bloodb brain barrier pharmaceutical
[553.88 - 558.00] companies big Pharma they design drugs
[556.72 - 560.84] to pass through your bloodb brain
[558.00 - 563.28] barrier they try really hard to do it
[560.84 - 564.64] funny thing is the drugs that they don't
[563.28 - 566.28] believe pass through the bloodb brain
[564.64 - 569.56] barrier still pass through the bloodb
[566.28 - 572.48] brain barrier so what is our blood brain
[569.56 - 575.76] barrier for what was our blood brain
[572.48 - 579.36] barrier originally designed for well
[575.76 - 582.96] I'll tell you to keep natural mostly
[579.36 - 585.16] bodily toxins out of the brain like when
[582.96 - 586.68] someone has a little too much uric acid
[585.16 - 589.60] in their system because they have a weak
[586.68 - 591.96] kidney issue if you have a weak kidney
[589.60 - 593.28] or kidney disease your uric acid's
[591.96 - 596.68] building up in your
[593.28 - 599.24] bloodstream that is not supposed to
[596.68 - 602.44] cross the bloodb brain barrier it's a
[599.24 - 605.84] natural phenomenon a natural process
[602.44 - 609.92] it's a natural bodily function fluid
[605.84 - 612.92] it's a toxin our body is dealing with
[609.92 - 614.48] naturally we have a kidney problem we
[612.92 - 616.60] have uric acid built up in the
[614.48 - 619.28] bloodstream it's not supposed to cross
[616.60 - 623.44] the blood brain barrier if someone gets
[619.28 - 627.24] a cut and it goes too deep and there's
[623.44 - 630.48] an infection developing and even sepsis
[627.24 - 633.84] could be possible from a blood infection
[630.48 - 636.24] developing from that deep cut that
[633.84 - 638.08] infection is not supposed to cross the
[636.24 - 641.36] bloodb brain barrier that's what it's
[638.08 - 644.56] for and get ready for this one if
[641.36 - 647.84] someone ingests a toxic plant that's
[644.56 - 650.92] been on planet Earth for 10,000 years
[647.84 - 654.04] and grown naturally on the earth and was
[650.92 - 656.12] never meant to be human food the bloodb
[654.04 - 659.68] brain barrier is there to hold back at
[656.12 - 662.12] least some of the toxins in an effort to
[659.68 - 666.32] prevent the brain from going into toxic
[662.12 - 668.72] shock and still toxic chemical compounds
[666.32 - 672.60] from that plant will still cross the
[668.72 - 675.96] bloodb brain barrier but some will stay
[672.60 - 679.80] behind our cerebral spinal fluid which
[675.96 - 683.72] surrounds our brain and spinal cord is
[679.80 - 685.36] supposed to be pure the good stuff it's
[683.72 - 688.48] supposed to be
[685.36 - 690.80] uncontaminated it's supposed to be clean
[688.48 - 693.12] that's the goal gold standard in this
[690.80 - 696.04] time on planet Earth our cerebral spinal
[693.12 - 698.40] fluid is not pure though it's not the
[696.04 - 701.76] gold standard it's supposed to be but
[698.40 - 705.44] it's not it's harboring chemical soups
[701.76 - 709.72] from industry pathogenic byproducts
[705.44 - 712.76] toxic heavy metals and a crap ton more a
[709.72 - 716.08] thousand years ago our cereal spinal
[712.76 - 718.28] fluid may have just had some toxic heavy
[716.08 - 719.96] metals in it but that's about it from
[718.28 - 723.76] drinking water water in the cities from
[719.96 - 726.92] lead pipes there wasn't any Industrial
[723.76 - 729.48] Revolution plants all around the planet
[726.92 - 732.56] spewing out Mercury and toxins and all
[729.48 - 735.12] kinds of other poisons it didn't exist
[732.56 - 737.92] it was just some lead from drinking
[735.12 - 740.28] water and the occasional drinking of
[737.92 - 744.20] mercury Elixir thinking it might give
[740.28 - 746.44] you longevity or heal a chronic illness
[744.20 - 749.40] today we walk around
[746.44 - 750.44] polluted the blood brain barrier
[749.40 - 753.20] has
[750.44 - 755.44] limitations if an industry creates a
[753.20 - 758.52] battery and then that battery sits in
[755.44 - 761.12] the car and it corrodes and someone
[758.52 - 763.44] actually tries to change that battery
[761.12 - 766.68] and there's battery AET that appears on
[763.44 - 768.56] the battery and then gets consumed
[766.68 - 771.24] accidentally it's going across the
[768.56 - 773.40] bloodb brain barrier if a child gets a
[771.24 - 776.48] hold of a little battery and start to
[773.40 - 779.04] chew on it and the acid leaks and burns
[776.48 - 781.68] the child's throat it's not just just
[779.04 - 785.20] the burn on the child's throat causes a
[781.68 - 788.00] lot of problems it's the acid crossing
[785.20 - 791.00] the bloodb brain barrier industrial
[788.00 - 793.36] toxins and mercury and other toxic heavy
[791.00 - 795.20] metals are going to enter the brain
[793.36 - 797.36] they're going to cross the blood brain
[795.20 - 800.00] barrier when we think about the blood
[797.36 - 804.60] brain barrier we hear it or we talk
[800.00 - 807.76] about it it seems so strong in our minds
[804.60 - 810.00] it's like a barrier we hear the word
[807.76 - 813.56] barrier you look up that word barrier
[810.00 - 815.80] it's serious it means like a wall it
[813.56 - 819.60] means something blocking or
[815.80 - 822.60] protecting barrier but really it's
[819.60 - 825.60] really not like that at all it's a thin
[822.60 - 829.24] construction it acts as a type of thin
[825.60 - 831.72] filtering wall of tissue it's tissue
[829.24 - 833.48] it's not this incredible wall built out
[831.72 - 836.60] of stone and
[833.48 - 839.52] rock the bloodb brain barrier is not
[836.60 - 843.48] even as strong as your skin your skin on
[839.52 - 847.40] your face skin on your arm it's way
[843.48 - 850.04] weaker way thinner than any of that if
[847.40 - 852.24] you slap on some cologne or perfume
[850.04 - 854.00] right on your skin it's going to go
[852.24 - 856.08] right through your skin absorb through
[854.00 - 859.08] all the layers and enter your
[856.08 - 861.36] bloodstream the bloodb brain barrier
[859.08 - 863.72] worse goes through it like it wasn't
[861.36 - 866.20] even there and when that cologne enters
[863.72 - 868.92] your bloodstream just breathing it in or
[866.20 - 871.12] enters it through the skin it heads up
[868.92 - 874.16] and crosses the bloodb brain
[871.12 - 875.92] barrier there are many Pharmaceuticals
[874.16 - 879.44] designed to pass through your bloodb
[875.92 - 881.48] brain barrier morphine is one of them
[879.44 - 884.56] it's one of the reasons why morphine can
[881.48 - 886.80] kill you so easily it can cross through
[884.56 - 891.32] blood vessels of the brain and spinal
[886.80 - 893.44] fluid vessels fast remember this all
[891.32 - 896.20] Pharmaceuticals have toxic heavy metals
[893.44 - 898.96] in them so engineering Pharmaceuticals
[896.20 - 901.68] to cross the blood brain barrier means
[898.96 - 904.04] the toxic heavy metals in those
[901.68 - 905.88] Pharmaceuticals also cross through the
[904.04 - 910.16] bloodb brain barrier whether it's
[905.88 - 913.52] Platinum titanium copper Mercury
[910.16 - 916.88] aluminum were exposed via pharmaceutical
[913.52 - 919.04] pills creams and liquids and more and it
[916.88 - 922.36] all crosses the bloodb brain
[919.04 - 924.20] barrier and what about all the oxidation
[922.36 - 926.56] people having toxic heavy metals in
[924.20 - 928.40] their organs their livers you know
[926.56 - 930.52] medical medium information that got out
[928.40 - 932.84] there all these years how metals are in
[930.52 - 935.72] our organs and they're
[932.84 - 939.08] oxidizing as they're oxidizing they're
[935.72 - 942.04] leeching and that runoff which is the
[939.08 - 944.04] oxidation coming off those Metals
[942.04 - 947.32] travels through the body well that
[944.04 - 949.80] runoff that oxidation can also travel
[947.32 - 954.88] and cross the bloodb brain barrier
[949.80 - 959.08] too science of research medical science
[954.88 - 961.88] doctors none no one knew that the toxic
[959.08 - 964.08] heavy metals stored in small amounts
[961.88 - 967.28] throughout all the organs of the body
[964.08 - 970.80] and that a blood test
[967.28 - 972.56] taken doesn't catch that doesn't see
[970.80 - 973.84] that so when you get your blood drawn
[972.56 - 976.32] and they're looking for toxic heavy
[973.84 - 977.96] metals in there and they're really low
[976.32 - 979.88] you could still have a high amount of
[977.96 - 983.00] toxic heavy metals in your brain your
[979.88 - 985.52] liver your pancreas your spleen medical
[983.00 - 987.88] research and science did not know that
[985.52 - 990.36] they thought the blood test determined
[987.88 - 991.84] how many metals you had in your body and
[990.36 - 993.24] then the teachings of medical medium
[991.84 - 995.76] information getting out there for
[993.24 - 997.32] decades and the publishing of the books
[995.76 - 1000.20] has changed
[997.32 - 1003.20] everything now you'll see today when you
[1000.20 - 1005.64] get a blood test a lot of blood labs are
[1003.20 - 1008.76] actually putting a little disclaimer on
[1005.64 - 1011.68] the document on the test saying we're
[1008.76 - 1013.84] only seeing what we see in the blood but
[1011.68 - 1015.84] you could have it in the organs and
[1013.84 - 1017.76] tissue and the crazy thing is I can't
[1015.84 - 1019.64] tell you how many people have battled
[1017.76 - 1021.76] how many profess Professionals in health
[1019.64 - 1023.92] throughout the years when I said look
[1021.76 - 1026.08] the blood test doesn't show everything
[1023.92 - 1028.04] with toxic heavy metals it could be
[1026.08 - 1030.32] anywhere in your tissue your organs your
[1028.04 - 1032.16] brain and the blood test doesn't
[1030.32 - 1034.64] determine it same thing with hair
[1032.16 - 1036.68] analysis I battled so many different
[1034.64 - 1038.92] professionals on this and now the blood
[1036.68 - 1040.40] Labs put it on their documents as
[1038.92 - 1042.72] they're handing the documents out to
[1040.40 - 1044.92] people their tests meanwhile science
[1042.72 - 1047.12] hasn't studied or tested any of it where
[1044.92 - 1048.92] did they get the information they didn't
[1047.12 - 1050.76] do a study
[1048.92 - 1052.44] they can't measure it they've never done
[1050.76 - 1054.64] a study measuring it they're not
[1052.44 - 1056.52] biopsying people they're not actually
[1054.64 - 1058.56] sticking needles in people's tissue and
[1056.52 - 1060.36] saying well your blood test says this
[1058.56 - 1062.12] but we're actually doing biopsies on
[1060.36 - 1064.24] your brain and your tissue and your
[1062.12 - 1065.92] liver and your organs and your pancreas
[1064.24 - 1068.00] and we're looking woo you got some heavy
[1065.92 - 1069.68] metals in there still but the blood test
[1068.00 - 1071.60] says you don't have any they're not
[1069.68 - 1074.12] doing that at all where did they get it
[1071.60 - 1075.92] it came out of thin air well I know
[1074.12 - 1077.52] where it came from there's no study
[1075.92 - 1080.68] behind it and there's no science behind
[1077.52 - 1082.84] it it's a shame they don't site The
[1080.68 - 1085.72] Source other things pass through the
[1082.84 - 1089.00] blood brain barrier viruses and viral
[1085.72 - 1092.68] toxins now viruses are small all in its
[1089.00 - 1095.84] own can you imagine a neurotoxin coming
[1092.68 - 1098.64] from a virus just think about how small
[1095.84 - 1101.08] that really is a neurotoxin it goes
[1098.64 - 1104.44] right through the blood brain barrier
[1101.08 - 1106.84] fast and easy and neurotoxins coming
[1104.44 - 1108.88] from viruses well that's medical meme
[1106.84 - 1110.96] information as well
[1108.88 - 1113.48] one of the reasons publicly known
[1110.96 - 1115.44] medical research and science doesn't
[1113.48 - 1118.64] even identify
[1115.44 - 1121.64] neurotoxins is because they're so small
[1118.64 - 1125.12] when neurotoxins are excreted from the
[1121.64 - 1128.28] Epstein bar virus shingles virus hhv6
[1125.12 - 1130.72] hhv7 simplex 1 Simplex 2 and so many
[1128.28 - 1133.64] other viruses when they're
[1130.72 - 1137.00] excreted they are excreted in a liquid
[1133.64 - 1138.96] form and then that liquid slips right
[1137.00 - 1141.80] through the blood brain
[1138.96 - 1145.08] barrier if classified medical research
[1141.80 - 1148.36] and science ever discovered neurotoxins
[1145.08 - 1151.04] being released from viruses and they
[1148.36 - 1154.60] told publicly known medical research and
[1151.04 - 1157.32] science about it then science would be
[1154.60 - 1159.16] completely halted on it publicly known
[1157.32 - 1162.36] medical research and science would not
[1159.16 - 1165.92] be allowed to do any more research on
[1162.36 - 1168.40] neurotoxins involving viruses at all the
[1165.92 - 1170.64] reason because it would lead to the disc
[1168.40 - 1173.76] discovery that viruses actually eat and
[1170.64 - 1176.28] go to bathroom and this information
[1173.76 - 1179.16] about viruses releasing neurotoxins
[1176.28 - 1181.16] would compromise the gene Theory where
[1179.16 - 1183.12] medical science is trying to convince
[1181.16 - 1184.24] everybody on the planet they're sick
[1183.12 - 1186.76] because of their
[1184.24 - 1189.80] genes there are certain varieties of
[1186.76 - 1192.08] Epstein bar that can cross through the
[1189.80 - 1194.16] bloodb brain barrier and there are
[1192.08 - 1196.08] varieties that can't cross through the
[1194.16 - 1199.08] bloodb brain barrier but their
[1196.08 - 1201.60] neurotoxins still can either way way
[1199.08 - 1204.28] that's what gilon Beret syndrome is
[1201.60 - 1207.00] pathogens and pathogenic toxins and
[1204.28 - 1210.44] waste Crossing through the bloodb brain
[1207.00 - 1213.08] barrier the pathogens that can cross the
[1210.44 - 1217.20] bloodb brain barrier do so by latching
[1213.08 - 1219.80] onto the barrier itself and inflaming it
[1217.20 - 1222.00] all the way through they slowly do
[1219.80 - 1225.28] tissue damage to the barrier so the
[1222.00 - 1228.20] pathogens can enter and cross eventually
[1225.28 - 1230.72] permeating it and leaving microscopic
[1228.20 - 1235.44] thick barrier
[1230.72 - 1238.12] scars keep all of this in mind as easy
[1235.44 - 1241.80] as it is to convince us that our blood
[1238.12 - 1245.08] brain barrier is an impermeable presence
[1241.80 - 1247.84] that makes us impenetrable to the
[1245.08 - 1251.28] dangers that Industries release into our
[1247.84 - 1254.56] world all we have to do is look around
[1251.28 - 1258.12] us at the suffering on this planet to be
[1254.56 - 1262.00] reminded that this doesn't add up if we
[1258.12 - 1264.80] we want to save ourselves we can't take
[1262.00 - 1267.08] advantage of our body's protective
[1264.80 - 1271.40] mechanisms we can't take our bloodb
[1267.08 - 1274.76] brain barrier for granted but we do we
[1271.40 - 1278.16] have to protect our brain and body we
[1274.76 - 1281.92] have to bring every chance we can to our
[1278.16 - 1284.08] brain to protect it and that starts with
[1281.92 - 1287.76] bringing awareness to the Daily
[1284.08 - 1288.96] exposures in our Mists our brains and
[1287.76 - 1292.16] body
[1288.96 - 1295.52] have not betrayed us they've been
[1292.16 - 1298.28] betrayed by industrial chemicals and
[1295.52 - 1301.68] other contaminantes in our everyday
[1298.28 - 1305.64] lives that have only accelerated in

[1315.80 - 1319.04] medium information has never yet been
[1317.40 - 1321.08] proven wrong by medical science and

[1371.24 - 1374.88] like never before in our modern-day
[1372.88 - 1376.72] history it takes a greater force than us
[1374.88 - 1378.68] down here it takes a helping hand from
