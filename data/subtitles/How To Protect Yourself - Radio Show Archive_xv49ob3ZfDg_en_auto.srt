so if you get a chance get down there

132
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,240
we're doing the light blast it's when

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,680
Spirit sends light literally from heaven

134
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,160
right on down on the crown of

135
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,160
everybody's head and it rushes through

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,840
their body and it's a rush it's a rush

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,960
and I say right after it after the light

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,960
blast I say no operating heavy machinery

139
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,280
for a few minutes after that light blast

140
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,479
because it is really intense it's there

141
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,759
to ignite the healing process to lift

142
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,000
people up to ignite the healing process

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,880
what it does is it that light rushes

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,440
through the body and builds up the

145
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,759
immune system it builds up the immune

146
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,319
system the lymphocytes the basophils the

147
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,360
monocytes the neutrophils the platelets

148
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,800
it just goes through the body and it

149
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,639
starts to get rid of any kind of

150
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Darkness any kind of bugs in people's

151
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,440
bodies and toxins and it helps to ignite

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
the it's the ignition of healing and

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,240
that's what we're doing I don't care

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680

thing and so stay tuned it started with

229
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,440
a gift at ag4 for me I diagnosed my

230
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,000
grandmother of lung cancer and spirit I

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,279
heard spirit for the first time I woke

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,079
up that morning and heard Spirit

233
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,399
perfectly clear in my ear and I've been

234
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,279
doing this ever

235
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,959
since so anyway look and as I've always

236
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,320
said before we don't have 10 or 20 or 30

237
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,399
years to wait for answers so let's start

238
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,079
the healing now let's learn how to

239
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,560
protect our ourselves from the

240
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,399
unforgiving four yeah you heard me the

241
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,360
unforgiving four so we're on it so what

242
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,320
is what is this the unforgiving for what

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,959
what am I talking about I mean some of

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,240
you might know already I've hinted I've

245
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,399
talked about it you know I've said

246
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,160
something about it I think I've even put

247
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,160
some stuff about out there maybe in the

248
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,200
newsletter or something so you know you

249
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
Pro some of you probably gotten you know

250
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,760
that but you know a lot of you may not

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,839
have heard about the unforgiving for the

252
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,800
unforgiving for is what Spirit calls

253
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,680
this group of things that get in our way

254
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,680
they interfere with our

255
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,399
lives they poison us they poison us they

256
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,480
inhibit us from healing they stop us

257
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,120
from healing or try to and they wreak

258
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,839
havoc and they're basically a threat

259
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
they basically a deception a threat a

260
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,120
deceptive threat you know you know

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:40,440
here's the deal you know when we grow up

262
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,000
when we grow up it's all about you know

263
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,240
it's all about safety when we're a child

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,440
it's all about safety your parents hold

265
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,720
your hand I talked about this before

266
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,000
they hold your hand before you cross the

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,519
street right I mean that's that's the

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,360
that's the goal in school there's these

269
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,320
different monitors in school they look

270
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,760
after you there's playground monitors

271
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,399
there's you know or whatever there's

272
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,560
just you know and now there's security

273
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,959
in schools and when you start getting

274
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,560
older and then you get insurance you

275
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,959
know you get car insurance you get all

276
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,920
the differ insurances you're always

277
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,240
trying to protect yourself you're always

278
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,839
doing all these things it's all about

279
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,639
protection on so many levels we

280
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
inherently talk about and we know about

281
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,560
in our

282
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,120
lives but what about and these are all

283
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,240
things we can see protecting ourselves

284
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,000
from any thing we can see so if a bus is

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,720
going down the road and we don't want to

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,880
get in the way of it we move

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,279
away okay or or our our parent or

288
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,120
Guardian pulls us away from that bus so

289
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,680
we don't get hit all

290
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,279
right or you know angels are trying to

291
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,000
protect us all the time too and they

292
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,760
might even if they have a chance can

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,440
pull us away from a

294
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,120
tragedy but it's always things we can

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,279
see you can see see it all you know you

296
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
got to be careful you got to be careful

297
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,240
if you're going swimming that you're not

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,120
in a in a you know too rough of a water

299
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:15,360
patch or Too Deep whatever it is it's

300
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,199
things we can see no matter what but

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,440
what about the things you can't see what

302
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,519
about the things we don't hear about

303
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,360
talk about much because or talk about it

304
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,440
all because you can't see it what about

305
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,720
those things

306
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,399
well they exist and that's what we're

307
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,320
covering that's what we're covering

308
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,120
because it's all about what you see in

309
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,199
this world it's all about got to see it

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,800
to believe it got to see

311
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,120
it got to see it to believe it you know

312
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
I'm not going to believe it unless I see

313
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,199
it right it's all about it's all

314
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,320
about it's all about what you can see

315
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,959
I'll see it if I I'll believe it if I

316
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,360
see it right is that what happens well

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,560
what you know there's a funny thing it

318
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,440
just reminds at me that's what happens

319
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,519
when people come to the event and they

320
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
never seen what I've done before what

321
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
Spirit does before I can't take any

322
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
credit for it that's what Spirit does

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,120
I've learned my lesson I tried to take

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,079
credit for it years ago you heard the

325
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,760
story you heard the story many times I

326
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,320
even told a story in my book in a

327
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,680
medical medium book the first book and

328
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,920
um you know I can't take any of the

329
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,519
credit I've learned my lesson I've

330
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,160
learned it well but you know when when

331
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,720
people go to the live event and and they

332
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,440
see me do my work on the stage where

333
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,839
Spirit or our work spirit and I our work

334
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,600
where spirit's telling me what's going

335
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,040
on with each person and what's wrong

336
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,959
with them and what's inside what kind of

337
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,600
illness they're dealing with you name it

338
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,120
and spirit's doing it for me and I'm

339
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,720
doing that and then people who have gone

340
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,120
there that maybe never seen or heard

341
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,440
about this but they go they they hear

342
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
about the event and they

343
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,839
come and they walk out and they're like

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,959
I don't know how he did that I don't

345
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,199
know how it was possible possible but

346
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,880
yes I I believe it because I've seen it

347
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,720
and so that's the kind of world we live

348
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,160
in and and that's fine there's nothing

349
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,839
wrong with that because we we like to

350
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,279
see things in order to believe them and

351
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,160
and the problem is with mystery illness

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,839
you guys with mystery illness the

353
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:26,880
problem is is that we can't see

354
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,920
it we can't see it so when you're sick

355
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,560
you get told hey you know you're fine

356
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,800
you look fine yeah you're laying in your

357
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,920
bed you're catatonic but you look fine

358
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,959
and you're probably making it up because

359
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,560
we can't see it the doctor can't see it

360
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,959
on the blood test no one can see it no

361
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,800
one cares because they can't see it so

362
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,519
um you just go off on your Merry way

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,279
Faker you faker right that's who I've

364
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,880
heard people tell me they've been called

365
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,440
fakers oh that makes me so upset that's

366
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,759
why I got to laugh about it because if I

367
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,680
don't I'm going to just be so you know

368
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,560
disheartened by it and it's saddened by

369
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,079
it and and I'm already it's already

370
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,360
saddening as it is because when I hear

371
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,839
it I get like welled up in inside and I

372
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,560
get emotional about it because it breaks

373
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,199
my heart if someone's called a faker

374
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,639
when they're really sick and the world's

375
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,720
getting a little better we're getting

376
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
we're finally getting to a place you

377
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,000
know the internet and a lot of

378
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,839
practitioners are are you know are

379
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,440
looking out

380
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,160
practitioners are are looking out for

381
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
people more and all these different

382
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,680
things are happening we're finally

383
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,040
getting to a

384
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,880
point where you know we're not told

385
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,959
we're faking it anymore in many aspects

386
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,839
of medicine but that's not entirely true

387
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,680
because there's still there's still some

388
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,680
leftovers um and you know and that's the

389
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,680
whole thing the process of of Planet

390
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,160
stress is you know it just if someone

391
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,360
doesn't experience it themselves they

392
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,720
think it doesn't exist

393
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,480
if they don't experience it themselves

394
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,160
they think it doesn't exist that's

395
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,040
planet Earth that's planet Earth here on

396
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
planet Earth I'm sorry to say and I'm

397
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,639
sure you know and you sure you lived it

398
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,839
I sure you seen it I'm sure you name

399
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,839
it if someone doesn't see it then they

400
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,959
don't believe it you get called a faker

401
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,560
cuz you're sick um you know mommies that

402
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,360
can't get out of bed and take care of

403
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,360
their kids there you know they can't

404
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,480
find anything on the test

405
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,680
and then the problem is is even if they

406
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,319
go to a good doctor and the doctor says

407
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,519
yeah you're sick so they get validated

408
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,040
they get validated with the wrong

409
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,720
illness in the wrong direction that's

410
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,160
still happening and we're trying to

411
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,079
change that at the medical Medium show

412
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
and the books and everything we're

413
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,759
trying to change that so but the bottom

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,240
line is it's a see it to believe it

415
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:55,040
world right

416
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,639
so if there's this unforgiving

417
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,880
for no one sees it then who's going to

418
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,720
believe

419
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,679
it and then we just get these different

420
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,640
tags and labels and I want to go I want

421
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,679
to go over a couple of things I've done

422
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,280
this before but it applies here so much

423
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,880
that I can't not do it and just ignore

424
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,120
it but

425
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,959
autoimmune autoimmune being told we have

426
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,240
autoimmune because medical research and

427
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
medical science doesn't know what's

428
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,679
causing your symptoms or your illness is

429
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,839
a

430
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,400
tragedy telling us that our body's

431
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,679
attacking and this is the first time you

432
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,640
logged on to this you don't know

433
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,640
anything about me you better believe it

434
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,440
you better know right now and I'm just

435
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,600
saying this for your own health and

436
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,559
wellbeing and your friends and your

437
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,120
families your body doesn't attack itself

438
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,360
you have to trust me on this and I even

439
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,240
hate saying trust me on this because

440
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,080
we're not even allowed to say this in

441
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,919
this world right now because there's a

442
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,799
whole thing going on out there if you

443
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
say trust me then people are like oh

444
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,520
I've heard that don't want to trust but

445
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
you better trust me because I'm telling

446
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,640
you right now you're body does not

447
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,480
attack itself it stands behind you it

448
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,640
works for you it won't hurt you it's

449
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,039
there helping you and medical research

450
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,400
and medical science has no clue about

451
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,159
this yet including alternative medicine

452
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,080
the best alternative medicine books

453
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,919
about autoimmune literally are rags and

454
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,559
need to be thrown in the garbage because

455
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,559
they say the the foundation is still

456
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,840
your body is attacking itself they

457
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,679
haven't even left that simple you know

458
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,960
mistake or that great mistake they

459
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,600
haven't even left the great mistake yet

460
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,559
of knowing that your body is not

461
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,000
attacking

462
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,640
itself okay and I'm giving you that

463
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,120
information now because it's important

464
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,559
because we're going into the unforgiving

465
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,960
four and there's four big things that

466
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,760
are causing the problems and in

467
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,679
completely tricking out the medical

468
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,080
research and Medical Science World so

469
00:18:52,679 --> 00:19:00,200
they turn the whole thing around on you

470
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,840
telling you that your body is attacking

471
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,679
itself when it's not okay do you see why

472
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm so serious about this did you put

473
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,320
your seat bels on you better put your

474
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,559
seat bels on and you better not be

475
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,120
driving an antique a 1960 you know

476
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,400
Cadillac that Cadillac that has no or

477
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,919
1955 Buick or something that doesn't

478
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,400
have a headrest on the back like the old

479
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,000
days so when you got hit from behind

480
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
your head wrenched back and you broke

481
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,400
your neck on one little bumper bumper

482
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,919
you know one little fender bender so no

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
antiques make sure you're in make sure

484
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,480
you're in some safe cars but just you

485
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,880
got to know something you got to know

486
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,760
something your body doesn't attack

487
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,760
itself it's not there going against you

488
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,240
it's because the unforgiving

489
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,520
for is on our

490
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,280
butts okay it's on our butts and it's

491
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,720
interfering with our lives and it's

492
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,200
tricking out medical research and

493
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,200
medical science sence so that they put

494
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,840
the blame on you it's so critical to

495
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,480
know this we're going to get into these

496
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,919
unforgiving for just but you have to

497
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,600
have the foundation you have to have a

498
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,240
foundation and the problem is in

499
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,799
alternative medicine I like conventional

500
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,000
medicine I like alternative medicine but

501
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,840
I work for you so I don't take

502
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,640
sides and I don't fall into to their

503
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,440
false belief systems like the body

504
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,240
attacking itself because I have Spirit

505
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,640
telling me what's really going on with

506
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,960
people because we work for you that's

507
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,400
who I work for I get up in the morning

508
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,039
and you know what I work for God but God

509
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
says if you're going to work for me

510
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,280
guess who you're going to be helping

511
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,200
you're going to be helping everybody

512
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,240
else so technically yes I'm helping you

513
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,320
I'm working for you and I got to watch

514
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,960
your back if I don't watch your back

515
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,240
then you know then what then you're

516
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,720
going to think your body's attacking

517
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,480
itself that's what so it's important to

518
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,200
know that research and science hasn't

519
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,159
discovered what's causing problems and

520
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,480
then alternative medicine you know God

521
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,320
loving God loving absolutely thank God

522
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,840
for any of our doctors alternative andc

523
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,640
conventional medicine but alternative

524
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,240
medicine some of the best trendy you

525
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,559
know lit you know literature that's out

there if they still think your body's

535
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,440
attacking itself and those are just

536
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,720
triggers then it's it's

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,200
behind because I'm going to give you

538
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,960
today what's causing all our trouble

539
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,039
another thing is mystery illness

540
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,320
we're

541
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:06,520
told that all your different ailments

542
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,400
your symptoms your conditions are not

543
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,240
mystery we're told that they're not

544
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,760
mystery that they've been figured out if

545
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,600
they've been figured out then why are we

546
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,279
still sick why are 300 million Americans

547
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,559
with symptoms and sick right now if we

548
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,120
figured it

549
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,520
out so they deem mystery illness just

550
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,919
for like a handful of rare cases once a

551
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,320
year once every three years you know

552
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,159
like just a few people fell down with a

553
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,919
fever somewhere and or some children

554
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,720
were sick and because of some you know

555
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,080
polluted pond water or something and

556
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,039
it's just okay it's a mystery illness

557
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,279
we're trying to figure it out they're

558
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,840
trying to troubleshoot it here's the

559
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,960
thing it's all mystery that's chronic

560
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,960
illness

561
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,960
related and what's behind all the

562
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,279
mystery are the unforgiving for once

563
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,039
again I'm going back to that cuz that's

564
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,240
what we're on today

565
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,240
and then it's all in your head it's

566
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,360
another thing like you created it it's

567
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,400
your fault you did it you you manifested

568
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,720
your

569
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,440
illness you know that's not true that's

570
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,120
not true don't believe that either

571
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,240
you're a good person you didn't created

572
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,200
it the UN the unforgiving for is what

573
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,000
creates it so you need to know that

574
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,840
that's so important to

575
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,320
know okay it doesn't mean we can't be

576
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,440
our own trigger sometimes when we get

577
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,200
hit with things and you know we get

578
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,200
breakups in relationships and it hurts

579
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
our heart so bad and we're so upset

580
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,960
that's a trigger it's an emotional

581
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,600
trigger but where we have to be able to

582
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,640
experience emotion we have to be able to

583
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,400
feel emotion so we can't be blamed for

584
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,039
feeling emotion and having it kind of

585
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,159
weaken us a little bit because that's

586
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,720
just life the idea is to be able to have

587
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,679
feel all the emotion you want whether

588
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,440
it's good or bad and survive it and the

589
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,600
unforgiving for is responsible for why

590
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,200
we have a hard time why we're triggered

591
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,320
by more things because the unforgiving

592
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,080
four is behind it all so when you go

593
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,600
through a hard time you can feel sick

594
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,240
afterwards and then we blame ourselves

595
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,880
when it's not

596
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,679
ourselves because it's the unforgiving

597
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,360
for see how it works very important and

598
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,840
then here's a big one I just have to

599
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:26,279
tell you genetics genes we're told it's

600
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,000
our genes we're told it's your genes now

601
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,360
that's why you're sick it's it's your

602
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,360
jeans you got faulty jeans you're a

603
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,520
faulty person that's demented cuz it's

604
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,120
not accurate and it's destructive and

605
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,399
poisonous these things are like weeds

606
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,919
they're like weeds of poison in a

607
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,039
beautiful garden and these are like

608
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,080
weeds of poison that are taking over and

609
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,279
they're going to hurt you because it's

610
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,360
not genetics that is why you're sick or

611
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,600
feeling sick research and science

612
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,440
doesn't know it's the unforgiving

613
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,080
for and and that's what it is not

614
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,159
genetics our genes didn't go bad in the

615
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,559
last 20 years that's why literally alone

616
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,679
half the US is more sick than than

617
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,200
meaning a whole half more of the US is

618
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,880
more sick than it was 20 years ago no

619
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,600
wondering 300 million Americans with

620
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,000
symptoms that didn't exist years ago I

621
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,320
promise you that didn't

622
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
exist the American dream was you lived

623
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,080
your life you did this you did that

624
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,399
here's you got older here's what you did

625
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,120
and sure you can have health problems

626
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,159
along the way they always existed but

627
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,640
nothing like they are today we're

628
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,960
struggling young and younger and younger

629
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,480
and younger and it's not genetics it's

630
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,600
the unforgiving

631
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,200
for so let's talk about that part now

632
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,080
let's talk about it the first part of

633
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,399
the unforgiving for is the viral

634
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,399
explosion the viral

635
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,720
explosion

636
00:25:53,399 --> 00:26:00,080
viruses understand the viruses have been

637
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,240
in our way especially in the last 100

638
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,520
years but now in the last 30 years in

639
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,760
our way like never before in

640
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,640
history they're in our way just take the

641
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,720
Epstein bar virus which for the first

642
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,320
time ever I brought to everybody's

643
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,960
attention about what the Epstein bar

644
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,720
does what symptoms it creates that alone

645
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,760
from fibromyalgia chronic fatigue

646
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,159
syndrome multiple sclerosis rheumatoid

647
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
arthritis these are all varieties of

648
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,120
Epstein bar and different varieties of

649
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,679
Epstein bar tingles and numbness um

650
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,760
blurry eyes brain fog uh ringing the

651
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,360
ears vertigo dizziness aches and pains

652
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,200
severe fatigue it's all Epstein bar

653
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,520
related Hashimoto

654
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,399
thyroiditis and the list goes on and on

655
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,880
and

656
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:51,640
on all from Epstein bar varieties alone

657
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,200
that are exploding and you're becoming

658
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,840
the expert and you're healing from them

659
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,679
cuz we're helping everybody we're we're

660
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,120
teaching everybody and we're helping

661
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,200
everybody so everybody every body learns

662
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,720
from it we all get better together and

663
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,760
then there's other viruses too there's

664
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,360
the shingles family that causes all the

665
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,440
other stuff going on burning mouth

666
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,559
burning tongue syndrome you know I'm

667
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,240
burning you know vaginal area burning

668
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,320
legs burning feet neuropathy in the feet

669
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,399
and legs ciona trigeminal neuropathy

670
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,640
trigeminal nerve problems all these

671
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:31,080
things are shingles Bells Palsy um

672
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,520
droopy eyes droopy you know all of that

673
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,000
is the shingles

674
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,200
virus and and the shingles does even

675
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,320
more but the these are the things that

676
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,559
I'm talking about and then there's other

677
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:46,840
viruses too like hhv6 hhv7 HH the

678
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,799
Undiscovered hhv 9 10 11 12 that Spirit

679
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,279
knows about and they're in our way they

680
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,799
create different types of heart problems

681
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,440
uh myocarditis endocarditis kidney

682
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,919
problems kidney failure all the

683
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,720
different problems and these viruses

684
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,640
exist it's part of the unforgiving for

685
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,559
and everybody wants to ignore them and

686
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,000
now that we're also bringing it to light

687
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,000
um some some leaders are taking the

688
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,919
information Spirit brought and they're

689
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,039
using it for their own game for you know

690
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,679
a claim and notoriety but skewing the

691
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,640
information so it ends up not helping

692
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,679
people anyway so thank God I have you

693
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,480
guys behind me because you guys are

694
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,000
taking the information and I and trust

695
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,480
in you and I trust that you guys you

696
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,080
know know the source and I trust that

697
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,559
you guys know it's never been talked

698
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,480
about out there and I trust that you

699
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,480
guys know you know how to spread the

700
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,320
information wisely and help others

701
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,480
whenever you can over the years and over

702
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,159
the time and I thank you for it and I

703
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,799
thank you for it okay because you guys

704
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:50,519
are the real deal the real

705
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:52,919
deal so here's the deal we got the viral

706
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,039
explosion there's always been bacteria

707
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,600
bacteria causes problems we talk about

708
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,399
that in the different shows we talked

709
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,919
about in the stret show we talk about it

710
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
in you know the STP aaka show we talk

711
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,480
about it in the different shows that

712
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,000
bacteria is a problem we know that but

713
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,679
the viral explosion is why we're dealing

714
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,519
what we're dealing it's why mommies lay

715
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:13,120
in bed and can't function and they got

716
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,200
three kids they can't feed and you know

717
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,600
it's it's literally like that kind of

718
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,919
thing all the time out there now it's

719
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,480
why we got the fatigue we got the

720
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,919
mysterious weight gain it's why we have

721
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,360

unforgiving for the next part is

747
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,440
radiation

748
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,760
radiation we're not looking at radiation

749
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,159
we ignore it we ignore it distance is

750
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,559
falling out of the sky and that's okay

751
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,919
same with the viruses you have to

752
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,919
understand all this is okay because we

753
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,360
got answers we got ways to protect

754
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:43,360
ourselves we got ways to heal now if I

755
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,799
just try to play the positive crap talk

756
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,480
where that this stuff doesn't really

757
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,320
exist and I just want to talk about hey

three great steps and not tell you the

760
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,440
truth not tell you really what's going

761
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,039
on not tell you what's happening that

762
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,600
would be the worst that would be

763
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,000
insulting that would be totally

764
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,519
insulting to you I'm going to tell you

765
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,440

way and I got to protect you so you get

769
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,039
out of your symptoms you get out of your

770
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,639
illnesses so you get better so just bear

771
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,120
with me while I talk about radiation a

772
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:23,200
little bit it's fallen out of the sky

773
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,840
okay from literally World War II never

774
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,279
mind Fukushima which is falling out of

775
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,880
the sky because of Fukushima 2o it's

776
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,399
starting to you name it Chernobyl you

777
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,880
name it it's been falling out of the

778
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:38,279
sky and it still is and it's in her way

779
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,080
and it's not just that our forefathers

780
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:45,399
our family like our past

781
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,360
relatives that we come from were

782
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:50,000
saturated in radiation as well during

783
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,919
the first x-rays during the first the

784
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,440
birth of the x-rays when we were like oh

785
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,120
my God this is exciting hop in front of

786
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,760
this machine get completely radiated

787
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,240
from head to toe where you see a

788
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,120
complete skeleton you know you see a

789
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,039
complete skeleton up against the the

790
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,799
screen the flat screen that's in front

791
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,840
of the person and you just just slam

792
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,480
them with tons of

793
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,799
radiation and women were getting

794
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,480
radiation treatments to their faces and

795
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,919
they were getting radiation severe

796
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,679
radiation Burns because they were

797
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,200
getting radiation treatments and the old

798
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,360
Dental the old dental work the radiation

799
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,240
it's shot right into everybody's neck

800
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,760
and head it was all in the past but the

801
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,320
problem is it gets passed down cuz it

802
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,039
lasts a million years and it's in our

803
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,799
forefathers then we we're conceived

804
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,080
we're birthed we have it it's just down

805
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,320
the line from all the way back down the

806
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,880
line since radiation was even figured

807
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,279
out and discovered now we could just

808
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,760
ignore it and forget about it and not

809
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,519
realize it's breaking down our immune

810
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,120
system and we're going to fix it there's

811
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,360
people that come to me like and say I

812
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,120
been to every doctor I've Been

813
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,320
Everywhere why is my immune system still

814
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,559
breaking down I've seen everybody I've

815
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,639
paid

816
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,639
$500,000 a half a million dollars to

817
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,120
travel around the globe and around the

818
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:14,120
world to try to fix my immune system and

819
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,120
it hasn't

820
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,720
happened and spirit would be like you

821
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,720
you got some radiation because your

822
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,080
forefathers were saturated with it and

823
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,799
died early because of it and like oh my

824
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,679
God yeah but we can fix it we can get it

825
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:34,080
out we can get it out with the right

826
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,679
Foods the power of the foods can get it

827
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,679
out if you know what you're using and

828
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,760
know what you're

829
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:44,720
doing we can get it out of the

830
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:48,080
body it's that simple but it takes a

831
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,440
little bit of work takes a little bit of

832
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,840
food it takes a little bit of time a

833
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,919
little bit of energy but you can do it

834
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,039
but the radiation is falling out of the

835
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,159
sky it's definitely hindering us it's

836
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,120
landing on our food sources and that's

837
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,679
okay because food gets rid of it and can

838
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,840
cancel it out the right kind of foods

839
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,919
can get rid of it and cancel it out we

840
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,240
can pull old radiation out of us that's

841
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,760
been in there for for a century from our

842
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,240
forefathers and it can be

843
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,599
done okay that's part of the unforgiving

844
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,839
for next part of the unforgiving for

845
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,960
toxic heavy

846
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,560
metals yeah toxic heavy metals Mercury

847
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,879
we have mercury in us that's a thousand

848
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,639
years old that's been mined out of Minds

849
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,399
thousand years ago and it stays in our

850
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,440
line it's not genetics everybody I'm

851
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,079
sorry to say it I don't mean to break

852
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,760
the hearts of the leaders that are

853
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,480
taking the genetic movement where they

854
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,599
are and the leaders that think that all

855
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,440
of our problems are genes I'm sorry that

856
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,960
all their funding and all their hard

857
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,280
work is not for the right thing I'm

858
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,000
sorry that's not my fault so I just have

859
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,240
to tell you the truth I can't protect

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,400
them I have to protect

861
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,560
you and it's not jeans it's Mercury

862
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,839
passed down generation after generation

863
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,520
hundreds of years of Mercury from when

864
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,440
our forefathers were drinking Mercury

865
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,079
Elixir just in the 1800s when all the

866
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,560
medical universities were closing down

867
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,680
because nobody went to doctors anymore

868
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,800
in the

869
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,800
1850s and the 1840s and the

870
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,200
1860s no one went to doctors anymore

871
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,000
they went for they went that's how

872
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,480
alternative healers were birthed they

873
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,800
were birthed out of the Mercury the

874
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,000
Mercury uh bomb of the uh 19th century

875
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,839
when the me when the conventional

876
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,599
medical world just gave you a big glass

877
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,000
of mercury when you went to the doctor's

878
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,800
office didn't matter who you were when

879
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,760
you left the doctor's office you were

880
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,800
raving you were raging mad Insanity

881
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,000
occurred you went home and your life was

882
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,880
over your family's life was over if you

883
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,160
were a working father and and you were

884
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,839
dependent on and you went went to the

885
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,000
doctor and drank a big glass of mercury

886
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,720
solution came home your wife would be

887
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,640
just

888
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,359
mortified and that was it you weren't

889
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,240
going to work the next day bills weren't

890
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,520
paid families crashed and that happened

891
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,280
because of the Mercury Elixir we still

892
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,200
have that in our bloodline it's not

893
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,319
genetics we got the Mercury in our

894
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,440
bloodline see how it works sometimes

895
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,119
going all the way back hundreds of years

896
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,560
all the way back going hundreds of years

897
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,119
Mercury all dating back to the Mercury

898
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,880
man and it's Mercury it's just

899
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,200
everywhere it's in our water it's it's

900
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
just you mean it's in the ocean it's

901
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:34,520
just everywhere it's all over the place

902
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,359
so the point is is that that Mercury's

903
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,599
responsible for so many things

904
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,599
depression Mercury responsible for

905
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,599
anxiety it feeds Epstein bar it feeds

906
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,319
the viral explosion they work together

907
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,839
the heavy metals and I'm all toxic heavy

908
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:49,880
metals and they feed the viral explosion

909
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,040
working together to help take us down

910
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,880
but guess what it won't take us down I'm

911
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,480
telling you my friend I'm telling you

912
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,960
folks it won't take us down because we

913
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,240
have have a way to fight it clean it out

914
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,880
I talked about the Frozen wild

915
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,520
blueberries removes heavy metals I talk

916
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,839
about the heavy metal detox check out my

917
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,440
heavy metal detox check it out it's in

918
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,960
book one the heavy metal detox from

919
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Spirit to remove that heavy metal out of

920
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,440
your system so you can get rid of your

921
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,160
symptoms that correlate with the viral

922
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,079
explosion you can get rid of that out of

923
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,079
your

924
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,640
body okay and and I'm going to give you

925
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,200
some tips first of all if you get heavy

926
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,680
metal tested and it shows really low

927
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,160
doesn't mean it's not really high cuz

928
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,760
they can't test inside your nervous

929
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,000
system they can't test to see how much

930
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,760
mercury you have in your nervous system

931
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,800
this is a mistake made all the time you

932
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,119
know Spirit told one person that I know

933
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,640
a while back Spirit told one person

934
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,920
you're really high in heavy metal you're

935
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,040
high in mercury that's why you're you're

936
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,599
feeling like you're feeling and they're

937
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,119
like well I don't believe you because I

938
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:51,119
had a test and the test said I was low

939
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,400
first of all the test for heavy metals

940
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,040
is not even accurate because it cannot

941
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,599
test how much heavy metal it's inside

942
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,839
deep in organ or inside the central

943
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,240
nervous system or inside your brain it

944
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,560
can only test if you've been freshly

945
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,359
exposed to heavy metal in the

946
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,119
bloodstream that means you would have

947
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,880
had to eat a can of tuna the day you got

948
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,400
the blood test so the can of tuna would

949
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,680
leech the mercury into your bloodstream

950
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,480
the day of your blood test or the day

951
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,960
before your blood test to show up a

952
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,720
little bit of mercury a little

953
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,040
bit and nobody knows that information

954
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,560
but you know it now

955
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,000
you know it now because of spirit and

956
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,599
that's how it works so we get the toxic

957
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,200
heavy metals they go inside our liver

958
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,520
they're inside our brain they're deep in

959
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,680
our system and Mercury is a big big

960
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,280
piece of it all never mind the alloy the

961
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,839
alloy that occurs you guys what happens

962
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:54,280
is when they make steel they mix it with

963
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,040
Metals when they make when they make a

964
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,880
bicycle they have an alloy different

965
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,480
varieties of metals to make the bike

966
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,480
lighter and stronger it's called an

967
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,119
alloy right when we get these Alloys

968
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,359
inside our brain in our body I talked

969
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,960
about it in the brain health show we get

970
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,000
these Alloys they're a mix of metals

971
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,880
disturbing our function giving us a low

972
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,839
quality of life giving us

973
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,319
symptoms and even some

974
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:27,160
conditions and this is the the the

975
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:29,760
movement of mean this is the Wrath

976
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,400
of the toxic heavy metals part of the

977
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,920
unforgiving

978
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,680
for and once you start taking these

979
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,200
things out with the foods you need once

980
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,240
you start taking them out with the foods

981
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,880
you need and you start taking the

982
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,359
radiation out with the foods you need

983
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,640
radiation that's not even yours not even

984
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:49,839
yours and you end up owning it when it's

985
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,160
not even yours it's pushed on you same

986
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,760
with the toxic heavy metals toxic heavy

987
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,119
metals from the past that's not even

988
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,839
yours it's somebody else is all the way

989
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,760
back and it's not even

990
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:08,440
yours okay and we get these things and

991
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,920
we have them and it's time it's time to

992
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,040
get them out of our body and out of our

993
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,480
system so we can get rid of the

994
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,680
unforgiving

995
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,440
four we're going to recap a little bit

996
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,800
cuz we still got one more to go still

997
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,440
got one more unforgiving four to go

998
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,359
we're going to recap a little bit we got

999
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,160
the viral explosion all the upstein bars

1000
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,880
I was the first to break to the table

1001
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,760
that there's over 60 varieties of

1002
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,640
Epstein bar in six different groups and

1003
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,560
they date all the way back to the late

1004
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,880
1890s and they've mutated they've grown

1005
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,640
in different strains that's what we're

1006
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,480
up against and you are cleaning it out

1007
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,640
and you're kicking but because you're

1008
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,319
getting rid of those viruses right now I

1009
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,720
got people all over the world getting

1010
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,800
rid of their viruses getting rid of

1011
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,319
their Epstein bar and they're gaining

1012
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,079
they're getting their life back and you

1013
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,640
can too and you're already doing it

1014
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,760
you're you're already working on it and

1015
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,280
so it's the foods that that starve out

1016
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,400
the viral explosion get rid of it help

1017
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,839
clean it out you name it we talked about

1018
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,560
that on the Epstein bar webinar recently

1019
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,599
we talked about that on the Epstein bar

1020
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,000
show and that's what we're doing and

1021
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,480
then we got the radiation the radiation

1022
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,119
going all the way back we since World

1023
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,000
War II it's falling out of the sky we're

1024
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,599
getting rid of that too out of our

1025
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
bodies all the different you know

1026
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,280
radiation that was passed on from the

1027
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,560
forefathers getting it from old x-rays

1028
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,440
and everything we're getting rid of that

1029
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,960
and then the toxic heavy metals we

1030
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,280
talked about that just now let's talk

1031
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,079
about the number four of the unforgiving

1032
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,400
for it's

1033
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:46,520
DDT would you believe it

1034
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,240
DDT why would DDT even be possible isn't

1035
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,960
that something from the past isn't that

1036
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,400
over with isn't that done right I mean

1037
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,720
is DDT like you don't hear about it

1038
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,640
anymore right right I know you don't

1039
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,960
hear about it anymore and it's DDT where

1040
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,160
is it what's it doing it's first of all

1041
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,079
it's not gone and there's other

1042
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,240
pesticides and herbicides and fungicides

1043
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,240
and insecticides that are its cousins

1044
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,560
that are here every day being sprayed

1045
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,640
everywhere else but even DDT itself is

1046
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:24,440
not gone it's not gone what of the most

1047
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,160
evst chemicals of all time one of them

1048
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,040
and it's still being put on

1049
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,200
food it's still being sprayed in all

1050
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,559
kinds of different countries around the

1051
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:39,839
world and it's still in the air it's

1052
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:44,079
still in the air it's still in our water

1053
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,000
it's still in our ocean it's still

1054
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:52,240
everywhere and it's in our way the worst

1055
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,839
part about DDT it's Everlasting you guys

1056
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,720
it's

1057
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,680
Everlasting we it comes from our for

1058
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,920
forefathers our family of in the past

1059
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:07,920
our families would eat it sleep in it

1060
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,480
breathe it bathe in it we were washed

1061
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,160
down in it Parks were washed down hosed

1062
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,720
while all of the children were just

1063
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,480
saturated in it and sued up in it and

1064
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,559
rolling around in it it was sprayed on

1065
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,760
food it was considered a nutritional

1066
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,359
supplement it was in every Garden around

1067
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,760
everyone's

1068
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:29,480
house and it killed all practically

1069
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,319
every single bald eagle in this

1070
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,960
country okay and it's done worse than

1071
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,880
that it's done terrible things and it

1072
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,520
sits inside people inside their livers

1073
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,680
and it's passed on to generation and

1074
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,640
generation and we still have it in US

1075
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,400
hey look I'm not going to I'm not going

1076
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,720
to cookie cut this and just pretend this

1077
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,200
is just a you know a cute little

1078
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,599
positive talk show about how this and

1079
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,240
that you know like I know it's getting

1080
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,680
done out there and I get it I respect it

1081
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,599
but I'm saying I'm not going to hold

1082
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,880
this back from you I got to help protect

1083
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,960
you and help look out for you and so you

1084
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,240
can get the DDT out of your liver you

1085
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,240
can get it out of there so it's not

1086
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,400
giving you exmos orasis so it's not

1087
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,760
causing problems so you can get it out

1088
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,440
of you so it's not breaking down the

1089
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,520
immune system and we can do that and

1090
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,119
that's what I talk about in the book

1091
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,960
especially life changing foods to 50

1092
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,160
foods and I Mark which ones take out DDT

1093
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,960
which ones take out DDT and eliminate it

1094
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,079
and pull it out and extract it from our

1095
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,599
livers DDT that you don't even get I

1096
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,119
mean DDT that's from the past that's

1097
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,960
literally from your

1098
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,319
grandfather or

1099
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,160
great-grandfather playing with it in the

1100
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,240
garden or or just getting it all over

1101
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,000
him because it was sprayed in every

1102
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,720
neighborhood every neighborhood in the

1103
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,720
streets they used to wash the streets

1104
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,800
down with it wash the streets down with

1105
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,400
it literally it didn't matter if you

1106
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,960
were walking on the street as it

1107
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,800
happened it was a movement of

1108
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,880
destruction of the worst way it's one of

1109
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,920

00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,400
this day even the most advanced book

1256
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:42,119
coming out on thyroid or anything else

1257
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,200
coming out literally this year that's

1258
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,480
still that's just coming out this year

1259
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,240
and early next year still doesn't even

1260
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,520
know about the real zinc yet the one

1261
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,079
that helps stop the viral explosion the

1262
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,440
Epstein bars still doesn't even know the

1263
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,520
right zinc

1264
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:01,000
yet so you have to understand it's about

1265
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,599
watching your back for real and

1266
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,280
protecting you making sure we're getting

1267
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:10,559
you better and getting you moved forward

1268
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,280
so seaweeds the Atlantic coast seaweeds

1269
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,480
I like at I like the main lantic Co sea

1270
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,160
vegetables and you know here's another

1271
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,280
thing too you can't worry about what's

1272
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:23,000
in a seaweed especially the main Coast

1273
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,000
seaweeds because there's not enough of

1274
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,040
the problems in it there's not enough

1275
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,559
heavy metal in the seaweed in fact what

1276
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,040
happens is when you eat the seaweed like

1277
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:36,160
the dolls it removes more heavy metal in

1278
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,839
fact any trace of ocean metal that could

1279
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,280
be in a seaweed like douls stays in

1280
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:43,119
douls never leaves it until it leaves

1281
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,799
your body in fact what happens is a

1282
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,240
miracle happens the seaweed absorbs more

1283
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:51,319
and more of it out of your own body

1284
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,000
pulls it all in one you know one group

1285
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:55,480
out of the body in case someone's ready

1286
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,839
to had you know another question that

1287
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,520
came up actually was you know how do

1288
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,839
seaweed work if it's in our ocean well

1289
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,200
I'll tell you how it works it holds on

1290
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:04,119
to whatever what was in it and then it

1291
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,799
takes out double triple quadruple more

1292
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,480
right out of the body and we pull the

1293
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:13,079
heavy metals out of our

1294
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,520
body so we got that we got the seaweeds

1295
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,839
we got and and I talk about that in

1296
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,319
life-changing Foods too that's another

1297
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:22,440
way of getting rid of things spirulina

1298
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,640
make sure you're taking your spirulina

1299
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,880
that pulls out toxic heavy metals it

1300
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,119
helps pull out

1301
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,880
radiation and it does help pull out a

1302
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:33,640
little bit of DDT get the hne spirulina

1303
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,119
