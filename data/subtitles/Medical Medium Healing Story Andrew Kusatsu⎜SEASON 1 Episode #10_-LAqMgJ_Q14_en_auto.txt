[0.03 - 4.44] Anthony William the medical medium here
[1.89 - 6.45] with a friend this is an amazing moment
[4.44 - 8.01] for me because we you know it's
[6.45 - 10.56] incredible work were here
[8.01 - 13.17] this is Andrew coos ah so he's gonna
[10.56 - 14.58] actually talk about what's happening
[13.17 - 16.92] with his eczema how he healed from his
[14.58 - 18.90] eczema this is going to be a great story
[16.92 - 20.84] of healing story inspirational some
[18.90 - 23.10] people are suffering from skin problems
[20.84 - 24.96] too dear friend of mine we're sitting
[23.10 - 30.69] here and hey it's great to have you here
[24.96 - 33.00] really nice though it's really and so
[30.69 - 34.32] the whole thing that I've always seen
[33.00 - 36.69] out there with all these years of
[34.32 - 38.60] decades is is that when people are
[36.69 - 41.34] suffering from skin conditions and
[38.60 - 43.50] whether it's eczema the psoriasis or
[41.34 - 45.72] another skin condition that they get a
[43.50 - 47.43] diagnosis of or don't get a diagnosis
[45.72 - 50.25] whether it's a dermatitis or even a
[47.43 - 52.02] vitiligo or anything and like its
[50.25 - 53.49] grossest whatever it may be skin
[52.02 - 55.77] relieved it it's one of the hardest
[53.49 - 58.17] struggles that we have for so many
[55.77 - 59.58] reasons because we can I mean there's so
[58.17 - 62.01] many people they can't even put clothes
[59.58 - 63.66] on it hurts so bad and the rashes can be
[62.01 - 66.84] so difficult they can crack and they
[63.66 - 68.28] bleed and and what I've always seen all
[66.84 - 70.77] these years going back since I was
[68.28 - 74.13] younger is people who probably they
[70.77 - 76.92] can't get answers and it hasn't changed
[74.13 - 80.10] you know 40 years ago when I was a
[76.92 - 81.30] little kid and people would actually ask
[80.10 - 83.46] you know they would say well does he
[81.30 - 85.38] have answers for eczema psoriasis and I
[83.46 - 86.97] would say well yeah Semler juice is part
[85.38 - 90.27] of it and there's other parts of it too
[86.97 - 93.72] but what would happen is you would think
[90.27 - 95.55] 40 years leader signs of research would
[93.72 - 98.22] have solved it and that's what everybody
[95.55 - 101.25] believes they believe that science
[98.22 - 102.45] research has an answer in ten years for
[101.25 - 104.43] everything what are we going to be in
[102.45 - 105.63] five years do you ever feel that like
[104.43 - 108.42] you don't I mean with other things like
[105.63 - 112.92] it's like where are we gonna be and and
[108.42 - 115.23] for some reason for some reason it's
[112.92 - 119.58] it's unbelievable how it works I'm gonna
[115.23 - 123.26] actually do some point you have a
[119.58 - 123.26] feeling yeah mother Laurie lens
[124.47 - 136.54] hey we're live totally unscripted so um
[133.75 - 139.57] but you know hey everybody's looking for
[136.54 - 142.54] answers they still are and and we get
[139.57 - 144.85] comfortable thinking hey you know if I
[142.54 - 147.46] ever do get something happened to me if
[144.85 - 148.54] I ever do get some type of interruption
[147.46 - 149.83] in my life where I'm dealing with
[148.54 - 152.26] something because that's what it always
[149.83 - 153.85] feels like it's like okay well now I got
[152.26 - 155.23] a skin problem and now I have to go see
[153.85 - 158.73] a doctor now let's go see another doctor
[155.23 - 161.32] now you know and and deal with in the
[158.73 - 163.54] discomfort of it all we always think
[161.32 - 165.58] that if I was if I was to ever have
[163.54 - 166.69] something science and research surely
[165.58 - 167.98] would have the answers by then the
[166.69 - 169.33] doctor must have an answer at the
[167.98 - 171.52] doctor's office but what happens to
[169.33 - 173.62] people with excellent psoriasis they
[171.52 - 176.17] don't they end up bumping into walls
[173.62 - 181.30] with this you had like some serious
[176.17 - 186.52] stuff going on with it it's pretty so
[181.30 - 189.96] like for us this was spring 2015 I had a
[186.52 - 192.79] little looked like a spider bite or a
[189.96 - 195.52] mosquito bite yeah that's persisting on
[192.79 - 198.67] my calf and weeks were going by which
[195.52 - 200.71] turned into months and then it started
[198.67 - 202.87] it wasn't going away and I was getting a
[200.71 - 205.66] little worried and then it started
[202.87 - 207.64] getting a little like fussy like red
[205.66 - 210.82] spots around it and that freaked me out
[207.64 - 213.10] so I went to my primary physician look
[210.82 - 216.55] at a bunch of ten tests biopsies blood
[213.10 - 218.20] work everything came back inconclusive I
[216.55 - 220.54] wasn't allergic to anything the biopsies
[218.20 - 225.19] came back negative so she sent me to a
[220.54 - 228.19] dermatologist and went to the
[225.19 - 230.91] dermatologist he without testing right
[228.19 - 235.84] with this his eyeball test said it's
[230.91 - 239.23] ringworm and that freaked me out gave me
[235.84 - 241.45] a bunch of antibiotics with two went
[239.23 - 244.84] home got two antibiotics within a
[241.45 - 248.80] 12-hour window my whole block body blew
[244.84 - 251.68] up yeah in in spots and I freaked out
[248.80 - 253.39] called him told me to get off it I went
[251.68 - 254.53] back into his office that same day the
[253.39 - 259.38] following day
[254.53 - 262.81] initially of seeing him put me on more
[259.38 - 267.57] antibiotics and then that kind of set in
[262.81 - 270.60] motion this four and a half year journey
[267.57 - 273.21] that I've included seeing three
[270.60 - 275.38] dermatologists one in Encino and in
[273.21 - 280.51] Westlake one in Beverly Hills
[275.38 - 283.09] I saw one dermatologist in Tokyo I saw
[280.51 - 285.07] two allergists I saw a pathologists I
[283.09 - 291.25] saw two acupuncturists my primary
[285.07 - 296.59] physician and they basically all told me
[291.25 - 298.09] that there was no cure that my body was
[296.59 - 301.36] attacking himself it was some type of
[298.09 - 303.88] blanket autoimmune situation happening
[301.36 - 306.13] well that's a thing so you've heard that
[303.88 - 308.56] your body's attacking itself hmm I mean
[306.13 - 310.41] definitely from pretty much from all of
[308.56 - 313.33] all the doctors I hope they said yeah
[310.41 - 314.46] and that the only treatment for it was
[313.33 - 316.84] steroids
[314.46 - 318.58] one one of the doctors went so far as to
[316.84 - 320.68] say I might like to wear loose clothes
[318.58 - 323.05] that it might be the materials in my
[320.68 - 326.62] clothes that to stay away from extreme
[323.05 - 329.50] hot and cold weather situations humidity
[326.62 - 331.03] you know not humidity you know dry here
[329.50 - 332.89] too you know that's something you
[331.03 - 335.05] probably always throw you know I noticed
[332.89 - 338.68] none of it made sense it was it was it
[335.05 - 342.28] was a very I was kind of thrust into
[338.68 - 345.93] this vicious cycle of just confusion it
[342.28 - 348.88] created more questions and answers and
[345.93 - 350.71] that kind of set me on this path of I
[348.88 - 352.51] was sick of using the steroids but I was
[350.71 - 356.38] still using it to levy eight the
[352.51 - 357.64] discomfort and pain of it and that kind
[356.38 - 359.53] of sent me on this path of trying to
[357.64 - 361.75] figure out some alternative methods so
[359.53 - 363.55] that was I tried doing a gluten-free
[361.75 - 365.92] diet but I didn't really know why to go
[363.55 - 369.13] gluten-free because I Paul my allergy
[365.92 - 371.77] panels came out negative to it so I did
[369.13 - 373.45] that for six months I went sober for two
[371.77 - 375.07] separate six months things thinking
[373.45 - 379.09] maybe alcohol was playing a role in the
[375.07 - 384.01] operations on my immune system I did a
[379.09 - 385.00] blood type diet ultimately none of those
[384.01 - 388.00] things were working with
[385.00 - 389.41] I wasn't it wasn't attacking with the
[388.00 - 394.71] root cause with because no one knew what
[389.41 - 400.33] it was so fast forward from spring 2015
[394.71 - 401.98] to this past fall of 2018 I got some
[400.33 - 406.36] more flare ups they were persisting I
[401.98 - 411.28] was using the steroid cream wasn't going
[406.36 - 415.75] away January of this year I went to
[411.28 - 419.10] Paris for work and the flare-ups got a
[415.75 - 423.01] little worse they started intensifying a
[419.10 - 426.52] few weeks prior to leaving overseas my
[423.01 - 429.85] friend Karina had put me on to your
[426.52 - 433.84] information and I bought the liver
[429.85 - 436.60] rescue book brought it to Paris with me
[433.84 - 438.46] hoping I could kind of read it during my
[436.60 - 441.37] travels but I was too busy with work but
[438.46 - 443.95] on the on the trip home at 11 hours to
[441.37 - 445.81] kill so I figured I'd break into the
[443.95 - 448.18] book you can crack the book with 11
[445.81 - 449.44] hours my whole thing was I'm gonna read
[448.18 - 455.74] a couple of them I'm gonna read a couple
[449.44 - 461.11] chapters and pass out and was I read the
[455.74 - 463.63] entire book I was up for 11 hours was
[461.11 - 470.70] moved to tears you're fast reader it's a
[463.63 - 470.70] big book with like jaundice and pandas
[471.33 - 478.33] so it was like the introduction wrapped
[475.66 - 480.13] me in yeah the high cholesterol
[478.33 - 481.81] situation is something I've been dealing
[480.13 - 483.58] with up in dealing with strap which
[481.81 - 485.53] isn't particularly mentioning in
[483.58 - 489.58] chapters but there's the supplement
[485.53 - 491.68] regimen you to help with strap and then
[489.58 - 493.54] the eczema obviously so I was able to
[491.68 - 495.82] kind of fast-forward through a lot of
[493.54 - 499.48] pages in the middle of the book because
[495.82 - 500.77] it didn't apply to me and so that's how
[499.48 - 502.75] I was able to kind of work through it
[500.77 - 506.29] but I had my phone next to me the book I
[502.75 - 509.95] was taking notes I was in sensing pages
[506.29 - 513.28] it triggered me it make sense it made
[509.95 - 516.55] all the sense in the world it was I had
[513.28 - 517.53] never gotten an explanation what was
[516.55 - 521.25] happening internal
[517.53 - 524.85] yeah it was only it's autoimmune your
[521.25 - 526.98] body's not explained how he's attacking
[524.85 - 528.69] it was the three of your pillars of what
[526.98 - 530.84] they were your body is attacking the
[528.69 - 534.06] skin that's what you get out there and
[530.84 - 535.62] the problem is with that even with the
[534.06 - 537.54] best functional medicine doctors the
[535.62 - 540.36] best alternative doctors conventional
[537.54 - 541.89] doctors they still go with even if they
[540.36 - 544.98] believe in a different modality of
[541.89 - 547.83] healing mm-hmm okay they still believe
[544.98 - 549.33] in the old grandfathered law that was
[547.83 - 550.71] wrong to begin with that your body's
[549.33 - 552.42] attacking itself that it's autoimmune
[550.71 - 555.00] that your body is actually attacking the
[552.42 - 557.67] skin that was a massive mistake in 1950
[555.00 - 559.14] and it wasn't even proven there was no
[557.67 - 561.51] science research proving it it was to
[559.14 - 564.18] protect science it was to protect
[561.51 - 565.59] literally science not the person because
[564.18 - 568.26] they put the blame on you so you go to
[565.59 - 571.65] the doctor you got you got a condition
[568.26 - 573.24] you need help for help from and it's not
[571.65 - 575.16] the doctors fault he doesn't know but
[573.24 - 577.95] what happens is that you leave what's
[575.16 - 580.53] just the answer is your body's attacking
[577.95 - 582.06] its own and then in top of being in pain
[580.53 - 584.07] that doesn't help because you're
[582.06 - 585.45] wondering why is my body doing that you
[584.07 - 587.43] know I mean that's what happens
[585.45 - 590.25] well the inflammation thing kind of
[587.43 - 592.80] triggered me I was taking Dragon's Blood
[590.25 - 596.82] which sounds nefarious but it's a tree
[592.80 - 598.86] sap yeah Amazon yeah we always look for
[596.82 - 600.63] something in the Amazon we always look
[598.86 - 602.13] for the new thing we always look for
[600.63 - 604.02] something that's out there that's what
[602.13 - 606.57] usually happened and we get told hey
[604.02 - 609.18] someone says this let's try this let's
[606.57 - 613.94] try that thank you awesome no no no it's
[609.18 - 616.20] this is incredible I was doing neem oil
[613.94 - 617.70] yeah that's one that's always play
[616.20 - 620.25] that's getting thrown around out there
[617.70 - 623.40] these are the trendy things that are
[620.25 - 625.32] backed by some money and agenda the
[623.40 - 627.06] trends that get thrown into the system
[625.32 - 629.94] John I've seen trying this world and
[627.06 - 633.39] you're trying that away and exactly but
[629.94 - 636.18] it was all topical so what really kind
[633.39 - 638.54] of resonated with me when I cracked in
[636.18 - 640.89] the liver rescue and also I'd listen to
[638.54 - 644.28] Anthony's to podcast episodes there's
[640.89 - 646.27] one in 2016 I think another 2018 on
[644.28 - 649.01] eczema psoriasis acne
[646.27 - 650.69] and those are extremely well informative
[649.01 - 653.50] but that was the whole point
[650.69 - 656.15] everything was this topical thing and
[653.50 - 658.67] the podcast and in the liver recipe
[656.15 - 660.74] chapter on eggs I'm going to attack the
[658.67 - 662.72] internal root of what's happening and
[660.74 - 665.93] that's kind of exactly what I was
[662.72 - 667.64] searching for when all this confusion
[665.93 - 671.51] was getting stoked by the doctors that I
[667.64 - 673.73] was I was seeing so when I finally had
[671.51 - 678.62] gotten these answers reading this on the
[673.73 - 680.33] plane it completely changed everything
[678.62 - 683.06] for me in my life it changed the
[680.33 - 686.03] trajectory in my life I ended up a week
[683.06 - 688.07] later getting home I went to Japan for
[686.03 - 689.75] two weeks so I couldn't institute the
[688.07 - 691.46] protocols right away but I ended up
[689.75 - 696.14] bringing some dulse with me and some
[691.46 - 697.97] spirulina barley grass powder - do you
[696.14 - 699.23] have your do you have some of this stuff
[697.97 - 701.48] cause it's so you brought a bag I
[699.23 - 703.45] brought of it okay I'm also paranoid
[701.48 - 719.00] about leaving like my laptop in my car
[703.45 - 722.71] but yeah every morning I this is some
[719.00 - 722.71] tumor you're better at this than I am
[723.67 - 727.97] stack them up there that's that's
[726.26 - 729.59] unbelievable so it's like you prepare
[727.97 - 731.68] that in the morning I prepare this in
[729.59 - 732.85] the morning so my morning routine
[731.68 - 734.72] [Music]
[732.85 - 736.04] essentially I've been starting to do
[734.72 - 740.33] some breathing exercises in the morning
[736.04 - 744.20] for the past couple like six weeks I do
[740.33 - 746.18] a cold shower and then I drink 40 ounces
[744.20 - 749.12] of lemon water after the shower nice
[746.18 - 750.89] nice and prettier direction waiting 30
[749.12 - 753.14] minutes after you drink the lemon water
[750.89 - 754.82] that have anything else
[753.14 - 757.61] it's the perfect 30 minute window to
[754.82 - 759.53] make all these and once these are all
[757.61 - 762.02] made after that 30 minute give or take
[759.53 - 763.43] window I make 20 ounces of celery juice
[762.02 - 766.37] yeah
[763.43 - 771.61] clean up the juicer do the dishes got my
[766.37 - 777.08] stuff up and head out but all of these
[771.61 - 778.91] are basically being a vessel for me to
[777.08 - 782.69] take in as much fruit and
[778.91 - 784.40] vegetables without I don't want to say
[782.69 - 788.72] the burning but I could never eat this
[784.40 - 793.19] much yeah vegetables in leafy greens and
[788.72 - 796.13] fruits this is a know you're busy too
[793.19 - 799.67] for sure you know I mean you're really
[796.13 - 802.64] on the run you're working you're doing a
[799.67 - 806.06] lot so having this blended up in
[802.64 - 808.13] tinnitus this design is incredible and
[806.06 - 810.98] and really helpful for I mean and maybe
[808.13 - 813.20] other people try it to this way if you
[810.98 - 815.00] can't do it this way you just try to you
[813.20 - 816.56] get the book you learn you learn the
[815.00 - 823.39] food see you try to get the heavy-metal
[816.56 - 826.04] detox movie in you I have oh yeah I mean
[823.39 - 828.65] this is this is incredible right here
[826.04 - 831.20] when I see this I get blown away and and
[828.65 - 833.90] I can't even tell you because he's
[831.20 - 838.13] actually doing everything to the letter
[833.90 - 842.63] and I mean what were you with your
[838.13 - 845.03] condition to how to how bad it was where
[842.63 - 847.79] I mean how uncomfortable it was to where
[845.03 - 850.01] you are now these days I mean we're in
[847.79 - 852.53] the past when it was at its height and
[850.01 - 854.18] state what was it like because it'll
[852.53 - 856.37] help people with Pima they're also
[854.18 - 858.32] dealing with that now does they feel
[856.37 - 859.85] they feel like they're alone and they
[858.32 - 861.86] feel like they're the only ones going
[859.85 - 863.51] through it and that there's no hope and
[861.86 - 864.65] I know so many people and so many of you
[863.51 - 867.02] guys have so many different skin
[864.65 - 868.67] conditions and it gets so bad where you
[867.02 - 871.78] can't even put clothes on and you're
[868.67 - 874.91] just an agony and everything else and
[871.78 - 877.58] you know and so by knowing that you went
[874.91 - 880.61] through this you had that skin condition
[877.58 - 882.08] to that degree and I maybe it just tell
[880.61 - 883.91] me what kind of where were you at when
[882.08 - 886.25] it was really at its all-time work
[883.91 - 889.31] there's an all-time worst was actually
[886.25 - 891.38] when I was detoxing prior to that it was
[889.31 - 900.14] bad I mean it was blowing up all over my
[891.38 - 902.27] body my legs my back arms but to the to
[900.14 - 906.65] the weight of how of the worst it ever
[902.27 - 908.51] got when I actually started detoxing and
[906.65 - 909.26] I'm getting it out of you attacking the
[908.51 - 911.99] pathogen
[909.26 - 913.52] metals and having the state of the
[911.99 - 917.90] topical steroid withdrawal all those
[913.52 - 920.21] things compounded to make the flare-ups
[917.90 - 923.06] that much worse and crazy I mean it was
[920.21 - 926.33] literally all over my torso my back
[923.06 - 927.71] shoulders arms legs and I want to talk
[926.33 - 929.36] about that for a second to why that
[927.71 - 931.76] happens because I don't even think I got
[929.36 - 934.37] a chance to tell you about that is is as
[931.76 - 935.93] there's a pathogen called epstein-barr
[934.37 - 938.33] okay there's over 60 varieties of
[935.93 - 940.01] Epstein Barr everybody has Epstein Barr
[938.33 - 941.27] that's why you want to learn how to take
[940.01 - 943.27] care of yourself because you can have an
[941.27 - 945.53] Epstein bar that creates an eczema
[943.27 - 947.30] psoriasis condition you can have an
[945.53 - 949.40] eczema you can have an Epstein bar that
[947.30 - 950.51] creates a bit of LIGO situation you can
[949.40 - 952.31] have one that creates chronic fatigue
[950.51 - 954.50] syndrome one that creates Hashimoto's
[952.31 - 956.72] it's the reason why because there's over
[954.50 - 958.76] 60 varieties of mutations of Epstein
[956.72 - 960.17] Barr we all have them in us that's what
[958.76 - 962.21] we have to take care of ourselves it's
[960.17 - 964.52] no joke that's why you need to know what
[962.21 - 966.14] the truth is so you don't end up 10
[964.52 - 967.88] years from now or 20 years from now with
[966.14 - 969.59] a diagnosis and a doctor telling you you
[967.88 - 971.66] have autoimmune and then you think it's
[969.59 - 973.28] genes or your body attacking itself and
[971.66 - 974.81] then nobody has answers and you're
[973.28 - 976.73] looking for neem oil and then all of a
[974.81 - 978.38] sudden you're looking for something else
[976.73 - 981.23] and next thing because that's what
[978.38 - 984.47] everybody does and and so the bottom
[981.23 - 987.23] line is is that what's what's happening
[984.47 - 990.35] here is that the liver gets built up
[987.23 - 992.63] with all this toxic matter that toxic
[990.35 - 994.94] matter is created from epstein-barr
[992.63 - 997.25] feeding off of copper when it's eczema
[994.94 - 999.56] psoriasis so when it's eczema or
[997.25 - 1001.90] psoriasis those two conditions that you
[999.56 - 1004.30] could get diagnosed with that's the
[1001.90 - 1006.37] pathogen epstein-barr the variety of
[1004.30 - 1007.96] epstein-barr there's over 60 varieties
[1006.37 - 1009.61] when someone says wow he thinks that
[1007.96 - 1011.80] I've seen bars everything no there's
[1009.61 - 1014.05] over 60 varieties of epstein-barr
[1011.80 - 1015.88] unknown to research in science the
[1014.05 - 1019.87] really important a really key thing to
[1015.88 - 1022.21] know and and so one of those bugs that
[1019.87 - 1024.94] we all have everybody's got these bugs
[1022.21 - 1026.65] in them bottom line it's not like andrew
[1024.94 - 1029.38] has this bug oh wait a minute no
[1026.65 - 1030.94] everybody's got it so I need you to know
[1029.38 - 1032.92] so you can protect yourself so you can
[1030.94 - 1035.26] actually make sure that you don't get in
[1032.92 - 1036.70] trouble or anything and you heal so what
[1035.26 - 1040.06] that virus does it the feeds off of
[1036.70 - 1041.92] copper and he has high copper so where
[1040.06 - 1044.74] did the copper come from
[1041.92 - 1045.82] and that's the thing that I was kind of
[1044.74 - 1047.62] perplexed on yeah
[1045.82 - 1050.53] tell everybody about that whole thing I
[1047.62 - 1052.66] was like where's the copper coming from
[1050.53 - 1055.33] if Anthony's family thinks he's got
[1052.66 - 1056.98] copper and the book says well you got
[1055.33 - 1059.80] eczema psoriasis where'd the copper come
[1056.98 - 1062.56] I mean I just honestly had chopped it up
[1059.80 - 1064.09] to it being part of my diet with
[1062.56 - 1066.52] whatever the herbicides pesticides
[1064.09 - 1070.33] fungicides if it was there's copper
[1066.52 - 1072.64] let's eat foods that I was eating in the
[1070.33 - 1074.38] water so shower there's a lot of copper
[1072.64 - 1076.78] and fungicides pesticides herbicides
[1074.38 - 1078.76] rodenticides all that stuff we get in us
[1076.78 - 1080.89] all the time if the neighbor spraying
[1078.76 - 1082.81] something that's that's copper getting
[1080.89 - 1084.16] in it and someone spraying something if
[1082.81 - 1085.51] you live in a condo if you live in
[1084.16 - 1088.15] apartment building and they're spraying
[1085.51 - 1089.35] things pesticides whatever it is or the
[1088.15 - 1091.51] highway you're driving down the highway
[1089.35 - 1093.04] and your windows open and they're
[1091.51 - 1094.60] spraying the sides of the highway you
[1093.04 - 1096.10] just get the copper in you so you're
[1094.60 - 1098.41] chalking it up to maybe some of them
[1096.10 - 1102.06] that's what I had assumed it was after I
[1098.41 - 1105.79] had kind of gone through what my second
[1102.06 - 1108.37] 369 liver cleanse I was kind of just
[1105.79 - 1110.08] thinking and it kind of dawned on me at
[1108.37 - 1110.77] my old house that I lived in for about
[1110.08 - 1115.06] eight years
[1110.77 - 1117.79] I had a copper sink the copper saying
[1115.06 - 1119.95] literally a copper sink and this is
[1117.79 - 1122.38] before the eczema this was before the
[1119.95 - 1124.72] exec Simone exactly so I had lived in
[1122.38 - 1128.74] this house starting in 2000 summer of
[1124.72 - 1132.13] 2010 so summer 2010 fast forward to
[1128.74 - 1135.49] spring 2015 is when I got this little
[1132.13 - 1137.95] bump which ended up becoming what the
[1135.49 - 1142.03] eczema brake was so that's about a five
[1137.95 - 1144.67] year window of me living in this house
[1142.03 - 1146.53] that had I don't know if it's that
[1144.67 - 1150.61] specifically but it makes a lot of sense
[1146.53 - 1154.03] of getting exposed to that much it does
[1150.61 - 1156.46] a toxic copper sink yeah because a
[1154.03 - 1158.20] copper sink is oxidizing is what's
[1156.46 - 1160.99] happening so that copper sink is
[1158.20 - 1163.47] constantly oxidizing even the fumes from
[1160.99 - 1165.52] that copper sink mmm the fumes alone
[1163.47 - 1167.62] inhaling it getting into the bloodstream
[1165.52 - 1168.91] then going up into the liver that could
[1167.62 - 1170.53] be a problem that you may not have a
[1168.91 - 1173.85] copper sink don't get that confused
[1170.53 - 1176.19] because coppers everywhere it's in every
[1173.85 - 1177.87] we're high in copper all of us and if
[1176.19 - 1179.73] you have a variety of epstein-barr that
[1177.87 - 1181.80] feeds off of copper you're gonna end up
[1179.73 - 1183.87] with eczema and a lot of people with
[1181.80 - 1185.13] women and men are ended young that women
[1183.87 - 1186.75] and men are ending up with their first
[1185.13 - 1188.49] sex bun the first thing that happens at
[1186.75 - 1190.26] the doctor's office because here's
[1188.49 - 1192.39] science and research the first thing
[1190.26 - 1194.40] that happens is it's ringworm that's
[1192.39 - 1196.65] that all the time I've heard this really
[1194.40 - 1198.09] hurt deck decades as well I did here at
[1196.65 - 1200.13] the dermatologist they think it's
[1198.09 - 1201.63] ringworm you're out the doctor and the
[1200.13 - 1203.55] interest he thinks it's ringworm right
[1201.63 - 1206.13] at the beginning when it's really really
[1203.55 - 1208.23] on how many look like it I mean I have
[1206.13 - 1211.02] the pictures it was literally a ring of
[1208.23 - 1213.66] spots yeah because it exactly because
[1211.02 - 1215.88] and and so because it's so confusing
[1213.66 - 1219.24] eczema when it starts or what it becomes
[1215.88 - 1220.89] it can easily come a process we'll wait
[1219.24 - 1223.14] a minute maybe it's a brain worm maybe
[1220.89 - 1225.24] this is something else maybe this is
[1223.14 - 1227.94] scabies maybe this is some dermatitis
[1225.24 - 1230.58] maybe this is you know and that's what
[1227.94 - 1232.53] happens and the family you can have
[1230.58 - 1235.53] answer so for dermatitis and other stuff
[1232.53 - 1237.12] anyway but the causes of course but you
[1235.53 - 1239.97] know or some of these other things but
[1237.12 - 1242.04] it's usually that that start up where
[1239.97 - 1244.20] you get the diagnosis of that you know
[1242.04 - 1246.96] ringworm could be this or it could be
[1244.20 - 1248.79] Lyme did you get bit by a tick did you
[1246.96 - 1251.85] get bit by a spider these are the places
[1248.79 - 1253.65] they go and I get it because they just
[1251.85 - 1256.20] don't understand the x-men's rises so
[1253.65 - 1257.76] much but the copper the copper sink yeah
[1256.20 - 1260.37] that's that's a great way of getting
[1257.76 - 1263.34] toxic copper in us but copper pans
[1260.37 - 1265.53] copper pots I've seen it all around if
[1263.34 - 1267.51] you go to a restaurant and you don't
[1265.53 - 1271.26] know but they have an old copper pot in
[1267.51 - 1272.88] the back and you know and then they made
[1271.26 - 1275.61] something in this copper pot in this
[1272.88 - 1276.81] restaurant that you just got infused
[1275.61 - 1278.82] with a whole bunch of copper and they're
[1276.81 - 1280.95] scraping the bottom of that pot and it
[1278.82 - 1283.26] went in the restaurant and that's how it
[1280.95 - 1285.72] works you just the water supply
[1283.26 - 1288.39] literally the talents the city water
[1285.72 - 1290.85] supplies load it with copper a lot of
[1288.39 - 1292.92] times elevated way too much copper than
[1290.85 - 1294.48] it should and then we end up drinking it
[1292.92 - 1295.92] we end up getting it in the restaurants
[1294.48 - 1298.20] we get it and we get it in all kinds of
[1295.92 - 1300.27] different places so we need to know
[1298.20 - 1302.16] we're not it's all of us are high in
[1300.27 - 1304.95] copper we deal with it it's a toxic
[1302.16 - 1306.52] heavy metal you know it's why I drink
[1304.95 - 1308.05] the heavy metal detox movies so
[1306.52 - 1310.30] you said to me like you don't need to do
[1308.05 - 1312.97] these things you Anthony you got
[1310.30 - 1314.68] everything out of you whatever no that's
[1312.97 - 1316.99] not true if I gotta eat in a restaurant
[1314.68 - 1319.30] if I got to do something I'm like okay
[1316.99 - 1324.46] when's my next copper load gonna happen
[1319.30 - 1326.59] and but the bottom line is is that you
[1324.46 - 1328.06] have to have that that bug like the
[1326.59 - 1329.95] epstein-barr and you have to have the
[1328.06 - 1332.02] metal copper in order to create eczema
[1329.95 - 1334.57] psoriasis and this is lightyears ahead
[1332.02 - 1337.15] of science and research light-years
[1334.57 - 1339.73] ahead because they want it they want it
[1337.15 - 1342.25] to be your body is attacking itself
[1339.73 - 1344.89] because it disempowers people especially
[1342.25 - 1347.68] women it disempowers be blend men you
[1344.89 - 1349.72] know it disempowers you I mean and in
[1347.68 - 1352.72] and there's a reason for this because
[1349.72 - 1355.57] science research is there not the blame
[1352.72 - 1358.81] squeaky clean squeaky clean that's how
[1355.57 - 1360.94] it works and and that's the problem they
[1358.81 - 1364.21] should just come out and be honest and
[1360.94 - 1366.64] just be like we don't know so let's be
[1364.21 - 1368.80] open to things that are working let's be
[1366.64 - 1370.87] open to things that are working because
[1368.80 - 1373.39] lives are critical they're important and
[1370.87 - 1376.03] when you suffer and you struggle I've
[1373.39 - 1378.43] seen babies with head-to-toe of eczema I
[1376.03 - 1380.92] mean can you imagine a child head-to-toe
[1378.43 - 1382.75] about what you had absolutely not born
[1380.92 - 1393.03] with it dealing with at a young age
[1382.75 - 1395.65] because you actually not know for sure
[1393.03 - 1397.45] but I think back to the kind of yeah
[1395.65 - 1400.47] empowerment thing I mean I think that's
[1397.45 - 1402.64] that is kind of the main thing that
[1400.47 - 1406.14] Anthony's information and reading his
[1402.64 - 1410.14] books was podcasts following his
[1406.14 - 1414.07] suggestions and his protocols has really
[1410.14 - 1417.99] anchored me in a sense of getting that
[1414.07 - 1423.16] empowerment back and taking control of
[1417.99 - 1425.71] my health of sorts it's translated even
[1423.16 - 1428.53] into some dealings with strep I used to
[1425.71 - 1433.45] get strep throat pretty consistently in
[1428.53 - 1434.89] my 20s then it went away I was every
[1433.45 - 1437.18] time I would just go to the doctor get
[1434.89 - 1439.79] amoxicillin
[1437.18 - 1441.95] whatever the other antibiotic was would
[1439.79 - 1446.20] do the full regiment the five seven or
[1441.95 - 1449.51] ten days I forget and it would be gone
[1446.20 - 1452.33] then about a year and a half ago this
[1449.51 - 1454.70] was around summer fall of 2018
[1452.33 - 1457.94] I got strep again for the first time in
[1454.70 - 1460.10] years that have been a really long time
[1457.94 - 1463.10] seven eight some odd years since I've
[1460.10 - 1465.85] gotten a case of strep throat same
[1463.10 - 1472.22] routine went down to the urgent care got
[1465.85 - 1476.36] amoxicillin and within a few days or
[1472.22 - 1479.18] within that week it's gone then fast
[1476.36 - 1485.96] forward to this past April I got it
[1479.18 - 1489.44] again and this time around I had
[1485.96 - 1493.28] listened to Anthony's podcast episode on
[1489.44 - 1494.90] streptococcus so I decided I made a
[1493.28 - 1497.72] conscious decision to try to institute
[1494.90 - 1502.19] some of his suggestions in there and
[1497.72 - 1504.77] treating the strep throat and if it
[1502.19 - 1506.45] wasn't gonna work I had prefaced that by
[1504.77 - 1509.09] calling my doctor and scheduling a
[1506.45 - 1511.13] meeting you'll get antibiotics the the
[1509.09 - 1515.80] following three days so it was about a
[1511.13 - 1515.80] Wednesday night I was feeling sick and
[1517.15 - 1521.12] didn't really know what's going on then
[1519.11 - 1522.98] that following Thursday
[1521.12 - 1526.22] I started getting spots on my throat and
[1522.98 - 1527.96] I knew immediately what it was so I
[1526.22 - 1529.94] called the doctor told him I was gonna
[1527.96 - 1532.76] come in on Monday so I was gonna be out
[1529.94 - 1536.00] of town to schedule an appointment to
[1532.76 - 1538.34] get on the antibiotics so but between
[1536.00 - 1541.70] that thursday in that monday i had
[1538.34 - 1547.79] loaded up on garlic thyme aromatic herbs
[1541.70 - 1550.97] oregano sage honey garlic ginger i was
[1547.79 - 1553.34] doing all my juices here i was taking a
[1550.97 - 1556.01] lot of the supplements that he suggested
[1553.34 - 1558.56] that crossover between the supplements
[1556.01 - 1560.27] that he suggests for strep or have a lot
[1558.56 - 1561.89] of crossover with the supplements he
[1560.27 - 1563.12] suggested for eczema the reason why
[1561.89 - 1565.34] because the reason why is because
[1563.12 - 1568.38] epstein-barr and strep go hand-in-hand
[1565.34 - 1570.15] the reason why you had this
[1568.38 - 1571.89] was because you had this epstein-barr
[1570.15 - 1574.41] since childhood because everybody has
[1571.89 - 1576.93] strep and epstein-barr they work.they
[1574.41 - 1579.03] the strep piggybacks on the epstein-barr
[1576.93 - 1580.83] that's what it does they work off of
[1579.03 - 1582.72] each other and and they live together
[1580.83 - 1585.63] and there's a reason for this because
[1582.72 - 1587.52] the distrib tends to break down the
[1585.63 - 1589.38] immune system so the epstein-barr can
[1587.52 - 1591.54] cause more trouble that's they work off
[1589.38 - 1593.49] of each other so what you are doing now
[1591.54 - 1595.08] you were you're knocking down the
[1593.49 - 1597.06] epstein-barr through information and
[1595.08 - 1599.25] liver rescue book you're cleaning up
[1597.06 - 1601.47] your copper and then the strep was like
[1599.25 - 1603.72] you're not now it's my turn basically
[1601.47 - 1606.30] you were it was like wait a minute rest
[1603.72 - 1608.40] the party's over and it was it was
[1606.30 - 1609.72] looking for a fight and that's what
[1608.40 - 1612.18] happened now it was time to actually
[1609.72 - 1613.62] start kicking kicking it a lot is what
[1612.18 - 1614.79] you were gonna do you've had it in your
[1613.62 - 1616.89] system all these years you've been
[1614.79 - 1619.02] getting bouts of it and now you're like
[1616.89 - 1621.51] okay let me go after it we also said in
[1619.02 - 1623.94] the podcast episode the antibiotics
[1621.51 - 1625.59] actually strengthen dis Rankine it so in
[1623.94 - 1628.41] this Franklin every time you take an
[1625.59 - 1630.90] antibiotic it strengthens both the virus
[1628.41 - 1634.02] in the bacteria streptococcus is the
[1630.90 - 1635.82] bacteria the viruses epstein-barr those
[1634.02 - 1638.58] both get strengthened from it from
[1635.82 - 1640.05] antibiotics it's why the eczema blew up
[1638.58 - 1642.66] remember when it was starting you only
[1640.05 - 1645.72] they need to be anyway and then it just
[1642.66 - 1648.27] blew it exploded right because it first
[1645.72 - 1650.13] of all that antibiotic feeds both those
[1648.27 - 1651.42] things that feeds the strep in the
[1650.13 - 1653.85] epstein-barr but especially the
[1651.42 - 1656.88] epstein-barr antibiotics have copper in
[1653.85 - 1659.64] them antibiotics have metals in them
[1656.88 - 1661.50] that's another thing too I'm not against
[1659.64 - 1664.14] totally against antibiotics for certain
[1661.50 - 1666.45] things but when it's used for the wrong
[1664.14 - 1668.10] thing it can make things worse right
[1666.45 - 1670.65] that's why the phone issue is that I was
[1668.10 - 1673.41] doing with yeah these particular so it
[1670.65 - 1675.88] took me three days so Thursday Friday
[1673.41 - 1678.76] Saturday of doing a heavy regiment
[1675.88 - 1680.26] the aromatic herbs of the garlic of my
[1678.76 - 1682.15] juices I was eating a lot of bananas
[1680.26 - 1685.54] which you suggested a lot of words
[1682.15 - 1689.44] outside of the juices I woke up Monday
[1685.54 - 1692.25] morning to go to my ten o'clock doctor's
[1689.44 - 1695.17] appointment and I looked in the mirror
[1692.25 - 1697.72] getting ready and the spots were gone in
[1695.17 - 1701.47] this without any without any antibiotics
[1697.72 - 1707.29] all using aromatic herbs juices fruit
[1701.47 - 1711.31] and zinc selenium metal mall in all the
[1707.29 - 1712.99] various supplements listed on what did
[1711.31 - 1713.59] it feel like to take control over you're
[1712.99 - 1716.20] helpless
[1713.59 - 1718.00] you got your drive in the machine you're
[1716.20 - 1721.24] driving it now you're driving your car
[1718.00 - 1723.52] you're you took control you know content
[1721.24 - 1726.55] the full context of it so that was in
[1723.52 - 1730.42] April of this year I'm jumping around
[1726.55 - 1734.26] here but I had attacked the eczema three
[1730.42 - 1736.84] months prior so in January when I read
[1734.26 - 1739.90] the book was in overseas read the book
[1736.84 - 1742.30] came back then I went to Japan we might
[1739.90 - 1746.02] a last-ditch effort at used doing a
[1742.30 - 1749.26] conventional path and saw a doctor in
[1746.02 - 1752.38] Tokyo she said the same thing loaded me
[1749.26 - 1757.45] up with steroids but for the sake of
[1752.38 - 1759.49] having a livable trip I was using the
[1757.45 - 1761.02] steroids so then when I got back I
[1759.49 - 1763.36] actually bought a juicer in Tokyo as
[1761.02 - 1766.39] well I was doing celery juice every
[1763.36 - 1767.23] morning so when I've gotten back in
[1766.39 - 1770.34] mid-february
[1767.23 - 1775.81] I started my first three six nine I
[1770.34 - 1778.48] lowered my radical fat intake I bought
[1775.81 - 1782.11] some of the supplements I did the lemon
[1778.48 - 1786.49] water and the celery juice and the first
[1782.11 - 1789.40] three six nine I did I didn't notice a
[1786.49 - 1791.17] huge change I thought I was gonna be
[1789.40 - 1795.07] leaps and bounds like detoxing like
[1791.17 - 1798.01] crazy but what ended up happening was
[1795.07 - 1800.83] was it was getting worse I was the spots
[1798.01 - 1803.38] were getting worse and I listened to his
[1800.83 - 1806.86] podcast about signs of signs and
[1803.38 - 1808.13] symptoms of detox and it just made all
[1806.86 - 1810.11] the sense in the world that my body
[1808.13 - 1811.94] actually healing itself by pushing this
[1810.11 - 1814.67] stuff out yeah this is how it this is
[1811.94 - 1817.33] how it happens and and actually cut
[1814.67 - 1822.01] myself off earlier so so going into that
[1817.33 - 1822.01] nothing you know a lot of moving parts
[1822.04 - 1827.15] it's the only way to do it you gotta be
[1824.42 - 1828.26] dealing you gotta be you gotta be you
[1827.15 - 1830.12] just got to be real and make sure
[1828.26 - 1833.12] everybody we get to help them eat the
[1830.12 - 1835.67] bottle yeah the bottom line is when the
[1833.12 - 1837.65] liver gets built up with with the
[1835.67 - 1839.45] pathogen yeah that's where I was earlier
[1837.65 - 1842.09] it was the pathogen epstein-barr and the
[1839.45 - 1844.43] copper when the pathogen I've seen bars
[1842.09 - 1848.27] feeding off of copper inside the liver
[1844.43 - 1851.21] it's releasing a derma talkin inside the
[1848.27 - 1854.24] liver before you get eczema before you
[1851.21 - 1857.48] get your first signs of sickness or for
[1854.24 - 1859.04] this condition and so your liver starts
[1857.48 - 1860.87] getting built up with more and more
[1859.04 - 1863.21] Dermott oxygen your livers trying to
[1860.87 - 1865.22] protect you so it holds on to it it's
[1863.21 - 1867.32] keeping it there it's putting it in
[1865.22 - 1870.68] storage bins it's putting it in pockets
[1867.32 - 1872.21] is what it's doing and as it keeps on
[1870.68 - 1874.61] building up and keeps on building up the
[1872.21 - 1876.32] liver finally says okay I can't handle
[1874.61 - 1878.03] this anymore what happens is people are
[1876.32 - 1880.67] these on hunt on these high-fat diets
[1878.03 - 1882.83] they think they have the Holy Grail when
[1880.67 - 1885.02] they're on the high fat keto high-fat
[1882.83 - 1886.88] you know whether it's whether it's
[1885.02 - 1888.02] plant-based or not playing a bass and
[1886.88 - 1890.15] they're doing these really high fat
[1888.02 - 1891.65] diets what they don't realize they're
[1890.15 - 1893.12] beating down their livers so if they
[1891.65 - 1894.59] have the epstein-barr inside the liver
[1893.12 - 1896.03] and they're doing all these high fats
[1894.59 - 1897.26] and they think that's the answer because
[1896.03 - 1898.55] they took away processed foods and they
[1897.26 - 1901.01] took away clue and then they took away
[1898.55 - 1903.11] or whatever and which is all helpful but
[1901.01 - 1904.85] there's still really high fat diet
[1903.11 - 1906.20] they'll end up and they're doing the
[1904.85 - 1908.57] bone broth and all these things and it's
[1906.20 - 1910.34] all high fat they'll end up with a
[1908.57 - 1911.81] problem where they're weakening the
[1910.34 - 1914.51] liver waking the liver and the liver
[1911.81 - 1917.18] can't hold on to that
[1914.51 - 1919.16] Dermott oxidant protect you anymore and
[1917.18 - 1920.33] it can't fight the epstein-barr anymore
[1919.16 - 1923.06] because the liver has its own immune
[1920.33 - 1926.63] system so we all beat our livers down so
[1923.06 - 1929.15] so our liver gets congested stagnant
[1926.63 - 1930.80] sluggish but filled with that Dermott
[1929.15 - 1933.62] oxen it's the epstein-barr
[1930.80 - 1935.42] feeding off of copper and then releasing
[1933.62 - 1937.37] a Dermott on st. so what does that mean
[1935.42 - 1938.82] the epstein-barr is going to bathroom it
[1937.37 - 1940.92] goes the bathroom in our box
[1938.82 - 1942.42] that's how it works when you have lupus
[1940.92 - 1945.48] it's going to bathroom releasing
[1942.42 - 1947.01] chemical toxins for neurotoxins for
[1945.48 - 1949.80] lupus when you have excellent psoriasis
[1947.01 - 1951.84] it goes about the releases copper toxins
[1949.80 - 1954.18] Dermot oxen so when it's vitiligo it
[1951.84 - 1955.86] releases aluminum toxins but I'll maybe
[1954.18 - 1957.93] I'll talk about that a little later so
[1955.86 - 1961.02] here's the deal when you're detoxing
[1957.93 - 1962.46] when you're cleansing this so you start
[1961.02 - 1965.34] doing something about it
[1962.46 - 1967.29] your liver is filled with this stuff
[1965.34 - 1969.15] it's filled with it and before anybody
[1967.29 - 1971.61] cleanses or does anything about it
[1969.15 - 1973.41] little bits of it you guys little bits
[1971.61 - 1975.24] of it are leaking out of the liver
[1973.41 - 1976.98] because it's overburdened because we're
[1975.24 - 1978.39] doing the high-fat diets all the time
[1976.98 - 1980.13] because we're not taking care of
[1978.39 - 1982.50] ourselves and hey it's nobody's fault
[1980.13 - 1984.09] it's just it's just life you know it's
[1982.50 - 1985.23] how it works nobody knows nobody knows
[1984.09 - 1987.48] how to take care of their health down
[1985.23 - 1989.10] here and it's all guessing games no
[1987.48 - 1991.14] matter who's a professional out there I
[1989.10 - 1992.91] still don't know it's unbelievable so
[1991.14 - 1995.01] the liver gets filled up with these
[1992.91 - 1996.87] copper toxins the derma stalks and it
[1995.01 - 1998.70] starts to leach out of the liver and you
[1996.87 - 2000.35] start getting your first signs just say
[1998.70 - 2001.82] you're a girl and you get your first
[2000.35 - 2003.26] signs of eczema you're like why am I
[2001.82 - 2004.76] getting these little bits of x-men you
[2003.26 - 2006.95] go to your dermatologist and they take
[2004.76 - 2008.42] go off gluten you go to your your doctor
[2006.95 - 2009.86] and they're like go off of this maybe
[2008.42 - 2011.42] you do a clean keto diet and you're
[2009.86 - 2012.62] getting a little better but then it
[2011.42 - 2015.62] comes back once in a while
[2012.62 - 2018.77] that's your liver being overloaded and
[2015.62 - 2021.29] then releasing little bits of this
[2018.77 - 2022.64] copper toxin this Dermott oxen into your
[2021.29 - 2024.11] bloodstream science research does know
[2022.64 - 2026.24] anything about this is all medical
[2024.11 - 2028.85] medium information from my source if you
[2026.24 - 2030.56] guys that are that are new here just you
[2028.85 - 2033.83] can look into my books and look into the
[2030.56 - 2036.80] source you'll learn how it goes but so
[2033.83 - 2039.08] and then when you want to clean this up
[2036.80 - 2041.87] finally when you want to do something
[2039.08 - 2044.63] about it and really heal and it's the
[2041.87 - 2047.45] right way to heal you're gonna end up
[2044.63 - 2049.67] releasing a lot of that Dermott oxen
[2047.45 - 2051.80] because you have no choice and you're
[2049.67 - 2054.32] gonna clean it out or cleanse it out and
[2051.80 - 2056.27] so that Dermott oxen is gonna flush out
[2054.32 - 2058.37] of the liver and it's gonna float around
[2056.27 - 2059.75] and it's going to end up going to her
[2058.37 - 2061.58] skin and we're gonna feel like we're
[2059.75 - 2064.01] getting worse before we get better and
[2061.58 - 2066.17] that's the that's it's a problem with
[2064.01 - 2068.18] eczema psoriasis because it's no fun it
[2066.17 - 2069.83] throws us off track sometimes and it's
[2068.18 - 2072.41] also a problem because there's protocol
[2069.83 - 2075.34] out there or there's modalities out
[2072.41 - 2079.55] there or belief systems that actually
[2075.34 - 2081.89] make it worse and it's not detoxing out
[2079.55 - 2084.77] it just makes it worse and that's the
[2081.89 - 2089.57] problem too and so I understand that
[2084.77 - 2091.64] like the the the fight out there for
[2089.57 - 2095.21] wanting to heal and find things that
[2091.64 - 2098.15] work because you can try a new diet or a
[2095.21 - 2101.12] new way to heal or an AIP diet for your
[2098.15 - 2103.25] excellent psoriasis and you can try
[2101.12 - 2104.57] something and it could make it worse and
[2103.25 - 2106.73] you could think you're getting better
[2104.57 - 2110.06] because you're detoxing no it's actually
[2106.73 - 2111.80] a diet and making it worse sometimes you
[2110.06 - 2113.15] know a diet like AIP will help it make
[2111.80 - 2114.74] it get a little bit better but you'll
[2113.15 - 2117.89] still be in the zone of it never getting
[2114.74 - 2120.92] better because what happens is like an
[2117.89 - 2122.78] AI P diet the makers or the or the the
[2120.92 - 2124.10] system that's built around it doesn't
[2122.78 - 2125.30] even know what causes your illness to
[2124.10 - 2126.83] begin with they think you have
[2125.30 - 2128.36] autoimmune and your body's attacking
[2126.83 - 2130.67] itself anyway they believe in the same
[2128.36 - 2132.05] thing everybody else does so until you
[2130.67 - 2133.76] can get away from that and realize
[2132.05 - 2135.59] there's four answers and real answers
[2133.76 - 2137.57] like with excellent psoriasis it's
[2135.59 - 2139.49] epstein-barr feeding off of copper
[2137.57 - 2141.53] coppers in your liver the Epstein bars
[2139.49 - 2143.15] in your liver it produces a derma stalks
[2141.53 - 2145.01] in that dirty toxin builds up in your
[2143.15 - 2146.63] liver it leeches out a little bit as we
[2145.01 - 2149.06] break our liver down and stagnate and
[2146.63 - 2150.86] get excited and stagnant sluggish and as
[2149.06 - 2152.84] it leeches out we get our first bouts of
[2150.86 - 2154.67] excellent psoriasis all on our body and
[2152.84 - 2156.95] we're getting our first little patches
[2154.67 - 2158.51] wherever it might be and then you know
[2156.95 - 2159.98] that's how it works and then if we want
[2158.51 - 2162.41] to really heal it and heal it the right
[2159.98 - 2163.61] way it's it's a little it's it can be
[2162.41 - 2165.29] confusing when you're healing it the
[2163.61 - 2167.03] right way because all of a sudden you're
[2165.29 - 2168.95] cleaning up that liver and that's what
[2167.03 - 2170.81] happened you're cleaning it up and it's
[2168.95 - 2173.12] flushing all those Dermott auxins out
[2170.81 - 2176.63] and now you got kind of a bigger bout of
[2173.12 - 2178.88] it as you're chewing yeah well it was
[2176.63 - 2182.72] seemingly confusing on why I was getting
[2178.88 - 2185.81] worse it actually was the sign that it
[2182.72 - 2189.53] was actually working so so maybe when I
[2185.81 - 2191.96] first did I did my first 369 I didn't
[2189.53 - 2193.76] start off the supplement excuse me
[2191.96 - 2196.13] regimen that he suggest in the book
[2193.76 - 2202.79] right away I really incorporated that
[2196.13 - 2203.75] after my first 369 then I tried having
[2202.79 - 2206.51] my normal day
[2203.75 - 2209.18] they diet according to the first three
[2206.51 - 2211.13] days of deliver rescue three six nine
[2209.18 - 2212.99] which are basically just removing your
[2211.13 - 2214.70] radical fat intake lowering your animal
[2212.99 - 2216.74] protein so once if you're gonna do it
[2214.70 - 2218.81] for dinner preferably and to bring in
[2216.74 - 2223.16] more fruits and vegetables throughout
[2218.81 - 2226.61] the daytime so I pretty much molded my
[2223.16 - 2229.73] day my daily routine around that then
[2226.61 - 2232.55] the flare-ups were getting worse of
[2229.73 - 2234.20] sorts so I decided to my second three
[2232.55 - 2237.50] six nine the following month in March
[2234.20 - 2240.83] this past March and that really
[2237.50 - 2244.40] accelerated things because I was doing

[2285.83 - 2293.75] got all 15 of them I did the daily
[2289.55 - 2295.70] dosage recommendation and I was
[2293.75 - 2299.15] basically operating on this how do I
[2295.70 - 2301.16] like fully optimize myself to get rid of
[2299.15 - 2304.07] this as soon as possible I was just
[2301.16 - 2306.59] completely fed up and over it so I was
[2304.07 - 2308.36] gonna sacrifice and do whatever it took
[2306.59 - 2310.70] well you know like in the book it'll say
[2308.36 - 2313.04] you know it'll have a list of things and
[2310.70 - 2314.48] you'll notice in the list of supplements
[2313.04 - 2316.28] one is barley grass cheese powder

[2325.52 - 2329.27] but you can put in your heavy metal
[2327.17 - 2332.36] detox smoothie which is actually in this
[2329.27 - 2333.68] book to the whole thing but you'll see
[2332.36 - 2335.09] that some of the things in the
[2333.68 - 2336.95] supplement list are part of the heavy
[2335.09 - 2340.24] metal detox smoothie to make sure we
[2336.95 - 2344.39] the metals metals on I I'm blown away
[2340.24 - 2348.43] that you actually just got into this
[2344.39 - 2350.87] book like read read this book and
[2348.43 - 2353.99] understood this book yeah and then
[2350.87 - 2356.54] because you know it's I try to I try to
[2353.99 - 2359.12] make it as easy to read as possible but
[2356.54 - 2360.98] I when I get in this book this book Evie
[2359.12 - 2362.96] this books got a lot of material in it
[2360.98 - 2365.81] calm parents do something get into drink
[2362.96 - 2367.31] but but I gotta say I'm blown away that
[2365.81 - 2373.07] you went to the supplements I mean I
[2367.31 - 2374.66] didn't help them I didn't help you first
[2373.07 - 2376.67] of all we know each other
[2374.66 - 2379.34] second of all I mean I want everybody to
[2376.67 - 2381.38] know clear here that yeah we didn't have
[2379.34 - 2383.66] a consultation because I don't do the
[2381.38 - 2385.16] consultations because I had to just
[2383.66 - 2388.10] write the books and all this and also
[2385.16 - 2389.54] I'm praying that people knew that they
[2388.10 - 2392.30] would know that the information is in
[2389.54 - 2395.26] here but I mean you're obviously guided
[2392.30 - 2398.63] because by your internal source or
[2395.26 - 2400.07] workout Hertel outside source to and I'm
[2398.63 - 2402.35] blown away and I'm proud of you because
[2400.07 - 2404.45] I wasn't there to help you you know well
[2402.35 - 2407.78] I mean the thing is was you were and I
[2404.45 - 2409.58] think that that's something the the
[2407.78 - 2413.12] community that antthony's to be able to
[2409.58 - 2414.56] foster with is it's essentially free
[2413.12 - 2416.51] information I mean he's putting all the
[2414.56 - 2418.13] information out that's mostly mostly all
[2416.51 - 2419.69] the information in his books is provided
[2418.13 - 2422.00] for free in his hour of our long
[2419.69 - 2424.07] episodes on his podcast which span like
[2422.00 - 2428.71] three years in the library you can get
[2424.07 - 2431.99] it out in the library not to that's the
[2428.71 - 2434.36] social media is insane with all of the
[2431.99 - 2436.19] live videos the catalog ones that go on
[2434.36 - 2438.23] specific things there was one on eczema
[2436.19 - 2441.23] and psoriasis that I'd listen to maybe
[2438.23 - 2445.43] half a dozen or something just to kind
[2441.23 - 2449.12] of try to familiar we're producing a
[2445.43 - 2451.04] free a free video right here right I
[2449.12 - 2452.90] mean you and I are just doing this right
[2451.04 - 2455.15] we can help people I mean this alone you
[2452.90 - 2459.52] don't have to pay for two it's insane I
[2455.15 - 2459.52] mean and that was one of the biggest
[2460.15 - 2465.44] kind of eye-opening experiences that I
[2463.31 - 2467.15] had when I read the liver rescue for the
[2465.44 - 2469.04] first time when I started really diving
[2467.15 - 2469.99] into his social media and looking on all
[2469.04 - 2472.48] the information on his
[2469.99 - 2475.15] website was that all of this stuff was
[2472.48 - 2477.37] for free and it's out there whereas all
[2475.15 - 2479.20] these doctors and specialists are
[2477.37 - 2481.42] requiring you to have a subscription or
[2479.20 - 2482.98] they have a serum or a powder or a
[2481.42 - 2485.35] tincture that they're selling or some
[2482.98 - 2489.37] other websites always have you gotta you
[2485.35 - 2491.56] gotta get your credit cards now then you
[2489.37 - 2493.66] know look I don't even want
[2491.56 - 2495.34] advertisements in front of this video
[2493.66 - 2497.47] you need good YouTube you gotta wait 30
[2495.34 - 2499.81] seconds and then click you got to click
[2497.47 - 2502.36] the button saying you know what does it
[2499.81 - 2504.82] go to stop the iPad or something it's
[2502.36 - 2508.00] like no we don't want to do that because
[2504.82 - 2509.53] isn't this about you healing that's what
[2508.00 - 2511.60] it's about you know is it and that was
[2509.53 - 2514.39] the genuine nature and it was well
[2511.60 - 2516.22] received on my hand so that's what was
[2514.39 - 2517.69] the easy part so like when you said that
[2516.22 - 2520.06] you weren't there to directly help me
[2517.69 - 2523.09] you actually were because you provided
[2520.06 - 2525.04] all this information and the onus was
[2523.09 - 2528.22] really on me to kind of take control and
[2525.04 - 2531.13] to really Institute the things one of
[2528.22 - 2532.66] the big things that I had when I was
[2531.13 - 2535.30] exposed to the information and really
[2532.66 - 2538.12] dived into it was the source of it I was
[2535.30 - 2542.32] a complete skeptic I mean man's talking
[2538.12 - 2543.73] to a spirit and what is it what is it
[2542.32 - 2545.44] what is he talking to is he talking to a
[2543.73 - 2547.93] ghost is you know I get to experience he
[2545.44 - 2550.90] talking to an angel is he talking to a
[2547.93 - 2553.96] dead physician in a thousand years
[2550.90 - 2555.19] confusing that's my initial reaction I
[2553.96 - 2557.23] mean just on a human level it was a
[2555.19 - 2564.73] little like wait we're used to these
[2557.23 - 2566.92] analytical scientific empirical that's a
[2564.73 - 2569.26] thing I mean you're yep you're highly
[2566.92 - 2570.97] intelligent you know you know tech you
[2569.26 - 2572.89] know this you know that I mean you're
[2570.97 - 2575.14] broken man you're an artist yeah you're
[2572.89 - 2579.40] an artist not an artist oh man your art
[2575.14 - 2581.77] is your creative he you know he's your
[2579.40 - 2585.64] humble is what you are okay your humble
[2581.77 - 2588.10] your and but I know I know that you're
[2585.64 - 2591.25] an amazing amazing individual and being
[2588.10 - 2593.29] and but but it but it took it took you
[2591.25 - 2595.12] to be like wait a minute how do i well
[2593.29 - 2597.98] yeah I mean it took because you know is
[2595.12 - 2600.83] this guy talking to right
[2597.98 - 2602.18] and I grappled with it a little bit it
[2600.83 - 2605.30] like was hard for sometimes when I was
[2602.18 - 2607.01] suggesting and referencing Anthony's
[2605.30 - 2610.52] material to friends and family it was
[2607.01 - 2612.77] like he's not a doctor right okay I
[2610.52 - 2616.22] can't tell my mom I can't tell he's a
[2612.77 - 2618.50] doctor he's not and my mom I mean she
[2616.22 - 2620.69] when I was going through the worst of
[2618.50 - 2623.54] this so this was like in March of this
[2620.69 - 2626.33] year I mean she lost her her noodle I
[2623.54 - 2628.10] mean she was ready to take me to see our
[2626.33 - 2629.63] cousin who works at one of the best
[2628.10 - 2633.91] hospitals in like Philadelphia or
[2629.63 - 2636.35] something and I just tried to convince
[2633.91 - 2639.59] convince her that this was part of the
[2636.35 - 2640.76] process of the healing process that
[2639.59 - 2641.44] they're getting worse before it got
[2640.76 - 2645.59] better
[2641.44 - 2648.71] so yeah just back to receiving the
[2645.59 - 2651.08] information and kind of instituting it
[2648.71 - 2653.72] so when I had done when I had finally
[2651.08 - 2656.03] gotten all the supplements and I decided
[2653.72 - 2659.42] to do the second liver cleanse the
[2656.03 - 2664.04] following month in March that's when the
[2659.42 - 2666.11] real the weight of how much of the
[2664.04 - 2668.33] flare-ups and the intensity of it was at
[2666.11 - 2671.66] its all-time high I mean I was having
[2668.33 - 2673.25] sleepless nights my I would wake up in
[2671.66 - 2677.00] the morning and my sheets were bloody
[2673.25 - 2679.85] from from scratching it was highly
[2677.00 - 2681.86] uncomfortable one measure of comfort
[2679.85 - 2684.59] that I was able to find was taking
[2681.86 - 2686.63] oatmeal baths that's something that kind
[2684.59 - 2692.02] of just calmed me down and it alleviated
[2686.63 - 2692.02] some of the pain temporarily came back
[2693.13 - 2700.13] during the detox process it was very
[2697.73 - 2701.96] helpful but so my own thing was like
[2700.13 - 2704.02] fully optimizing so taking all the other
[2701.96 - 2707.75] supplements so I'd done my second 369
[2704.02 - 2710.78] and then it got worse and then finally
[2707.75 - 2714.11] it started subsiding in about early
[2710.78 - 2716.66] April of this year and then I decided a
[2714.11 - 2719.66] few weeks then two weeks after that I'm
[2716.66 - 2722.80] sorry is when that strep story I told
[2719.66 - 2724.64] you about happen and I instituted
[2722.80 - 2728.66] Anthony's suggestions from the
[2724.64 - 2731.54] streptococcus podcast episode and within
[2728.66 - 2733.55] three and a half days the strep is gone
[2731.54 - 2736.61] spots the swollen asana tonsils in my
[2733.55 - 2739.04] throat when you can beat strep with that
[2736.61 - 2742.16] in any biotic the positive thing about
[2739.04 - 2745.19] that is it wasn't saying it it means
[2742.16 - 2748.46] that the strep really did weaken because
[2745.19 - 2750.44] the strep gets immune to antibiotics
[2748.46 - 2751.97] that's how it works that's why acne gets
[2750.44 - 2754.64] worse in people because acne is caused
[2751.97 - 2757.25] by streptococcus that's why you know son
[2754.64 - 2760.55] strep sinus infections UTIs bladder
[2757.25 - 2763.40] infections all strep related all of that
[2760.55 - 2765.44] can get worse with me with antibiotics
[2763.40 - 2766.97] over time but yet we meet anyone it's
[2765.44 - 2768.62] because people get so bad and is so out
[2766.97 - 2770.99] of control they have to take one in
[2768.62 - 2774.44] order to survive did you try to reflect
[2770.99 - 2776.72] but if we could learn to actually break
[2774.44 - 2777.95] down that strep naturally like you did
[2776.72 - 2779.36] and that's the whole thing the
[2777.95 - 2781.13] information is there and the medical
[2779.36 - 2783.83] medium information is there what happens
[2781.13 - 2786.41] is if you get a win one win with strep
[2783.83 - 2790.25] without the antibiotic you're now ahead
[2786.41 - 2791.72] of the game because it's the antibiotic
[2790.25 - 2793.31] that gets us in trouble with strep so
[2791.72 - 2794.93] now we're ahead of the game we did you
[2793.31 - 2796.94] did that with your own immune system you
[2794.93 - 2799.34] did that with your own with the with the
[2796.94 - 2800.78] right healing tools and when you knock
[2799.34 - 2802.34] that down that's amazing what did you
[2800.78 - 2803.81] feel like what you didn't have to go and
[2802.34 - 2806.42] get the anyone how did you feel like
[2803.81 - 2809.12] again and it's kind of circles back I
[2806.42 - 2811.31] mean it was a major trigger and it also
[2809.12 - 2812.96] part of the skepticism that I had and
[2811.31 - 2815.45] kind of the waffling back and forth rows
[2812.96 - 2817.46] like it's not it's definitely true but
[2815.45 - 2818.57] the source is just bothering me of sorts
[2817.46 - 2824.96] just kind of like it's hard for me to
[2818.57 - 2828.67] reason but when I all of these things
[2824.96 - 2831.56] kind of happen together where the heavy
[2828.67 - 2834.02] detoxing of the eczema eczema was
[2831.56 - 2835.85] happening in that march in leading into
[2834.02 - 2837.68] the April and then that's when I got
[2835.85 - 2839.75] this other thing happened with strap and
[2837.68 - 2842.30] once I was able to cure that and heal
[2839.75 - 2844.46] that without any drugs just aromatic
[2842.30 - 2846.11] herbs supplements fruits and vegetable
[2844.46 - 2851.12] the right kind the right kinds of water
[2846.11 - 2854.56] and so forth yeah it sees that really
[2851.12 - 2856.55] really reinforced that what he was
[2854.56 - 2858.62] knowledge that he was putting out there
[2856.55 - 2861.41] for these specific instances that I was
[2858.62 - 2864.46] dealing with was strep and eczema were
[2861.41 - 2867.40] completely accurate and on point
[2864.46 - 2869.71] so after that lap that bout of strap of
[2867.40 - 2873.66] couple like a week or two later I did my
[2869.71 - 2876.07] third three six nine to really try to
[2873.66 - 2878.80] nail this because I was gonna be
[2876.07 - 2880.54] traveling in May overseas I tell people
[2878.80 - 2882.61] that repeats three six nine you do it
[2880.54 - 2884.53] repeats on it exact right that's that's
[2882.61 - 2886.06] yeah so you did your third one
[2884.53 - 2890.50] I did three so I did one in February
[2886.06 - 2893.89] when in March and one in April and by
[2890.50 - 2895.54] the time I did my third it was pretty
[2893.89 - 2900.46] much cleared up I mean I still have some
[2895.54 - 2904.00] flare-ups here and there but the the
[2900.46 - 2906.07] intensity and the pervasiveness of how
[2904.00 - 2908.80] much is that's completely gone I mean I
[2906.07 - 2913.86] have pictures I don't know to show them
[2908.80 - 2913.86] kind of where I'm at now and past but
[2914.79 - 2920.53] after that third 369 it was really a
[2917.68 - 2922.48] matter of kind of maintenance and how do
[2920.53 - 2924.91] I make sure that I'm continuing the
[2922.48 - 2926.56] protocol so that this never comes back
[2924.91 - 2928.90] something I never wanted to do with ever
[2926.56 - 2930.55] yeah yeah and you know when you keep on
[2928.90 - 2933.25] getting rid of the copper inside your
[2930.55 - 2936.73] liver and inside your body and then you
[2933.25 - 2939.99] break down the epstein-barr then you
[2936.73 - 2942.70] know sure you probably could go back to
[2939.99 - 2944.14] eating foods that you used to eat you go
[2942.70 - 2945.82] back to things I always tell people
[2944.14 - 2947.62] don't eat all the fruits and vegetables
[2945.82 - 2949.93] get the right stuff do for three six
[2947.62 - 2951.82] nine because you know something could
[2949.93 - 2954.07] happen you can get more we can get
[2951.82 - 2956.17] another epstein-barr you can literally
[2954.07 - 2957.94] get one you can be in a public bathroom
[2956.17 - 2960.40] and get one off of a toilet seat people
[2957.94 - 2962.53] laugh at that but it's just the true you
[2960.40 - 2964.48] can get an Epstein bar you can get an
[2962.53 - 2966.13] Epstein bar in any relationship you know
[2964.48 - 2967.78] I mean I have people that have over the
[2966.13 - 2970.18] years have come to me all the time and
[2967.78 - 2972.30] they and you know they got sick right

[2983.23 - 2986.56] is called the kissing disease you know
[2984.61 - 2988.69] that's why we but that's why they named

[3008.08 - 3011.08] section here and it talks about
[3009.46 - 3013.12] different supplements that those are

[3037.00 - 3041.47] the mystery strap where it's that but
[3039.79 - 3043.66] it's also a sore throat but the white

[3043.66 - 3046.69] people get like I know I got a little
[3045.31 - 3049.45] bit of sore throat this week I'm a
[3046.69 - 3051.37] little rundown that's strep mmm that's
[3049.45 - 3054.64] sitting there so it's important to know
[3051.37 - 3056.14] that and but but when we have strep
[3054.64 - 3057.70] penis there's epstein-barr and it's the
[3056.14 - 3061.75] whole bit we got it knocked both those

[3063.63 - 3069.63] one part of that there is no yeah tell
[3066.58 - 3072.46] me so first strep about that I've had
[3069.63 - 3077.95] that I had had in over a year and a half
[3072.46 - 3080.86] was in April this past October I noticed
[3077.95 - 3083.43] to a tee because I was was Wednesday it
[3080.86 - 3086.11] was Game five of the Dodgers gnats game
[3083.43 - 3088.63] the night before step that Tuesday
[3086.11 - 3089.71] before that Wednesday game I was feeling
[3088.63 - 3092.05] a little sick thought it was the
[3089.71 - 3094.66] changing seasons something allergies say
[3092.05 - 3098.05] men wins whatever I woke up that
[3094.66 - 3101.59] following Wednesday and was completely
[3098.05 - 3103.42] knocked out I mean body aches swollen
[3101.59 - 3105.31] throat looked in the mirror and of
[3103.42 - 3108.13] course I had I started to get spots I
[3105.31 - 3111.10] heard up going to the game that
[3108.13 - 3114.61] following night and was that full day
[3111.10 - 3116.05] leading up to the game I was again added
[3114.61 - 3120.34] in the aromatic herbs the sage the
[3116.05 - 3123.91] oregano all the time garlic shots the
[3120.34 - 3125.71] tumeric ginger these juices eating
[3123.91 - 3130.60] bananas to alleviate the pain I was like
[3125.71 - 3131.14] drinking tea and the one new thing that
[3130.60 - 3133.48] I did
[3131.14 - 3136.53] in this last bout that I had last month
[3133.48 - 3139.06] of strep was I bought elderberry syrup
[3136.53 - 3142.36] and talked about that which was
[3139.06 - 3146.64] incredible it super helped alleviate the
[3142.36 - 3152.20] pain that code in my throat so Wednesday
[3146.64 - 3155.26] is like day one of sorts Thursday day
[3152.20 - 3157.54] two of it Friday day three of it that
[3155.26 - 3159.79] following Saturday I went to a wedding
[3157.54 - 3161.95] in Santa Barbara and sure enough I woke
[3159.79 - 3164.59] up that Saturday morning and the spots
[3161.95 - 3167.22] were completely gone the body aches were
[3164.59 - 3169.60] gone and it was just another
[3167.22 - 3171.40] reinforcement was of late another
[3169.60 - 3173.95] formation and it would talk about
[3171.40 - 3175.09] empowering and heart going back to the
[3173.95 - 3178.48] things you were talking about with that
[3175.09 - 3180.61] but it was really kind of taking this
[3178.48 - 3182.56] into your own hands and it just proved
[3180.61 - 3186.01] to me that my bodies are meant to heal
[3182.56 - 3189.58] themselves yeah I've read somewhere that
[3186.01 - 3194.14] our gut lining re-established itself
[3189.58 - 3196.51] every three days so we're in constant
[3194.14 - 3198.07] motion of healing ourselves so adding
[3196.51 - 3200.05] aromatic herbs and supplements and
[3198.07 - 3201.37] fruits and vegetables it's just another
[3200.05 - 3207.72] thing to help accelerate the healing
[3201.37 - 3211.84] process and right now as it stands you
[3207.72 - 3216.19] know my eczema is subsided significantly
[3211.84 - 3219.33] I had the last time I saw my general
[3216.19 - 3222.61] physician when I got blood work done was
[3219.33 - 3224.86] 2018 I think spring of 2018 and my
[3222.61 - 3226.93] cholesterol level bad cholesterol in my
[3224.86 - 3230.44] family and my cholesterol reading was
[3226.93 - 3233.29] 304 and my LD 8 March eggless
[3230.44 - 3236.02] triglyceride panel there was it was
[3233.29 - 3237.55] unknown and I asked I inquired with my
[3236.02 - 3239.31] doctor and why there was no number
[3237.55 - 3242.02] attached to that he said my
[3239.31 - 3243.88] triglycerides were so high that it
[3242.02 - 3246.58] didn't register there was no a number to
[3243.88 - 3251.44] register I haven't gotten blood work
[3246.58 - 3253.30] done since that but I have to imagine my
[3251.44 - 3254.89] mind my cholesterol I can't wait and
[3253.30 - 3257.59] I'll definitely follow up with you but
[3254.89 - 3259.48] there's just there's no way you know why
[3257.59 - 3260.54] it was off the chart like this because
[3259.48 - 3262.19] I'll tell you
[3260.54 - 3264.89] I thought it was just a genetic thing
[3262.19 - 3268.34] because my family it runs in my family I
[3264.89 - 3270.14] didn't have the best diet for a long
[3268.34 - 3273.40] time I'm just kind of eating whatever I
[3270.14 - 3276.98] wanted partying doing the whole thing
[3273.40 - 3278.53] sure isn't really mindful of course the
[3276.98 - 3280.34] reason why is because that's your liver
[3278.53 - 3282.62] cholesterol is all about the liver
[3280.34 - 3284.24] that's the whole point and even talking
[3282.62 - 3287.27] about that in the liver rescue book with
[3284.24 - 3290.48] the but that's the cholesterol producer
[3287.27 - 3293.24] that's the cholesterol container so
[3290.48 - 3296.03] basically that cholesterol liver gets
[3293.24 - 3298.46] weak sick stagnant sluggish bad
[3296.03 - 3300.86] cholesterol it's the producer of good
[3298.46 - 3302.96] cholesterol that's all the liver right
[3300.86 - 3304.85] there trick this arise all the liver
[3302.96 - 3307.49] right there it's all about that and
[3304.85 - 3310.04] insulin resistance and blood fat and all
[3307.49 - 3312.29] the things they talk about and so your
[3310.04 - 3312.74] liver was just in and you got copper in
[3312.29 - 3314.38] the liver
[3312.74 - 3316.82] you got the epstein-barr on the liver
[3314.38 - 3318.26] the liver is gonna be all clogged up
[3316.82 - 3319.91] with all that Dermott oxen that was
[3318.26 - 3321.71] given you all the rashes of course
[3319.91 - 3322.97] you're going to be having liver problems
[3321.71 - 3324.98] other kinds of liver problems
[3322.97 - 3325.94] cholesterol you're gonna have that issue
[3324.98 - 3327.23] you're gonna have the end of the
[3325.94 - 3330.02] tracklist right you're gonna have other
[3327.23 - 3332.03] you're gonna have other liver issues and
[3330.02 - 3335.30] that's the thing with eczema psoriasis a
[3332.03 - 3337.46] lot of people actually have other liver
[3335.30 - 3338.84] issues it's in different ways and a lot
[3337.46 - 3339.92] of different ways not just cholesterol
[3338.84 - 3341.30] they might not have the cholesterol
[3339.92 - 3343.67] problem but they'll have something else
[3341.30 - 3345.74] but they'll have liver saw signs of
[3343.67 - 3348.86] liver condition you know liver condition
[3345.74 - 3350.75] in so many other ways so but that's
[3348.86 - 3352.91] incredible where you get another win
[3350.75 - 3354.59] like that where your your body is meant
[3352.91 - 3356.09] to heal itself when we give it the right
[3354.59 - 3357.47] things when we know what we're doing
[3356.09 - 3358.97] when we're not playing do you feel like
[3357.47 - 3361.07] you do you feel like you're playing a
[3358.97 - 3363.20] guessing game anymore if you like it
[3361.07 - 3366.05] honestly feel like I have the cheat code
[3363.20 - 3368.51] to life right now so it's not a guessing
[3366.05 - 3372.53] yet the password I have a password I
[3368.51 - 3376.13] have the cheat code it's um and it's
[3372.53 - 3377.66] been transformative I mean it's pretty
[3376.13 - 3380.00] much been the anchor I mean I've
[3377.66 - 3381.92] incorporated a lot of other things in my
[3380.00 - 3383.36] lifestyle I do cold showers I do
[3381.92 - 3384.89] breathing or yeah I want people to do
[3383.36 - 3386.57] that you know somebody said to me hey is
[3384.89 - 3388.19] it okay if I'm out there and I'm deep
[3386.57 - 3388.85] breathing in the morning at five in the
[3388.19 - 3391.34] morning
[3388.85 - 3393.23] and praying to the Sun I'm like yeah did
[3391.34 - 3396.17] you do it go do it is it okay if I do
[3393.23 - 3398.99] yoga everyday for now yeah go do it but
[3396.17 - 3401.69] that here's the thing this is the hard
[3398.99 - 3403.52] core answers though right because you
[3401.69 - 3405.20] could do all the yoga you want and you
[3403.52 - 3406.31] can do all the other practices you want
[3405.20 - 3407.80] you can do all the things that I believe
[3406.31 - 3411.68] in in love you can do all these things
[3407.80 - 3414.13] but if you don't have the answers right
[3411.68 - 3416.27] so that the real the the guessing game
[3414.13 - 3417.92] problem that happens when we're sick
[3416.27 - 3419.51] with things because if people they're
[3417.92 - 3421.49] doing all the different stuff they do
[3419.51 - 3423.50] the meditations they do this they do the
[3421.49 - 3424.73] rewiring of the brane meditations with
[3423.50 - 3426.14] how they think and they're thinking
[3424.73 - 3427.55] positive and they're doing this and then
[3426.14 - 3430.52] I'm doing the yoga now all the things
[3427.55 - 3432.83] that I love out there but you can be
[3430.52 - 3435.49] really sick because I've had a waiting
[3432.83 - 3438.59] list of millions of people back in 2014
[3435.49 - 3440.36] that all did that kind of stuff they had
[3438.59 - 3442.49] all these things they went to retreats
[3440.36 - 3444.23] they did this they did they were in the
[3442.49 - 3445.67] hot springs they were in the Cold
[3444.23 - 3448.85] Springs they were doing all these
[3445.67 - 3451.07] different things and and it didn't fix
[3448.85 - 3452.24] him it was great and they were also
[3451.07 - 3453.68] doing and even while they were doing
[3452.24 - 3456.17] this and everything else that it didn't
[3453.68 - 3457.73] like so because they needed the answers
[3456.17 - 3459.62] the science of research doesn't have
[3457.73 - 3461.12] other than that's a guessing game don't
[3459.62 - 3464.93] feel like you got the cheat code I got
[3461.12 - 3466.70] the money another huge aspect of this
[3464.93 - 3468.53] one when I was going through the worst
[3466.70 - 3471.97] of this this is the months of February
[3468.53 - 3475.10] March in April of this year I was
[3471.97 - 3477.20] completely knocked down helpless and
[3475.10 - 3480.14] thankfully I was able to rely on
[3477.20 - 3482.92] Anthony's repost with testimonials of
[3480.14 - 3488.17] various people you guys had appealed and
[3482.92 - 3490.52] I had nothing to lose so I slid in and
[3488.17 - 3492.74] message them on their Instagram teams
[3490.52 - 3494.45] and kind of told them my story and what
[3492.74 - 3497.72] was happening to me and they had any
[3494.45 - 3499.40] suggestions on how to kind of deal with
[3497.72 - 3501.44] it as I was going through this process
[3499.40 - 3503.30] literally every single one of them
[3501.44 - 3509.30] replied back how do better maybe a dozen
[3503.30 - 3511.46] 15 people I love you guys for helping
[3509.30 - 3514.37] him out like that that is my greatest
[3511.46 - 3516.20] dream right there is is you guys are

[3528.66 - 3533.73] gotta tell you I bow to you for doing
[3531.30 - 3535.80] that because you really do care and you
[3533.73 - 3537.90] have compassion so when he reached out
[3535.80 - 3541.32] you when you reached out and you DM them
[3537.90 - 3543.24] it took people very excited a fly fly
[3541.32 - 3545.88] back really fast some took a couple
[3543.24 - 3548.07] weeks which was fine but literally every
[3545.88 - 3550.29] single person that I am essage Don on
[3548.07 - 3552.15] Instagram DM that he posted that he
[3550.29 - 3557.19] posted their stories about every single
[3552.15 - 3559.95] one replied to me a major major level of
[3557.19 - 3561.27] comfort and reinforcement when I was
[3559.95 - 3563.04] going through the whole process I mean
[3561.27 - 3566.13] one of the people that stands out is a
[3563.04 - 3568.92] woman named what spirit says she had
[3566.13 - 3569.73] crazy debilitating okay I'm eczema
[3568.92 - 3571.68] head-to-toe
[3569.73 - 3573.54] she was super kind and helpful I talked
[3571.68 - 3577.86] to her a bunch thank you for giving a
[3573.54 - 3582.69] husband and wife in Australia I think in
[3577.86 - 3586.68] down the line but also one of the main
[3582.69 - 3589.01] things that I've tried to when I've kind
[3586.68 - 3592.05] of told my friends and family about
[3589.01 - 3594.09] Anthony and his suggestions and his
[3592.05 - 3596.10] protocols is that none of these things
[3594.09 - 3598.29] are like mutually exclusive like you
[3596.10 - 3602.43] can't I couldn't just do celery juice
[3598.29 - 3605.55] and not lower my fat intake and do the
[3602.43 - 3607.83] lemon water for this connection run need
[3605.55 - 3609.39] it you need it the whole puzzle right
[3607.83 - 3611.61] because they know that all the card
[3609.39 - 3613.17] oh it's accelerator slot and all be
[3611.61 - 3614.55] that's a thing on YouTube I've seen this
[3613.17 - 3616.08] on YouTube where people like I did
[3614.55 - 3618.66] celery juice for five days and now I'm
[3616.08 - 3621.00] gonna give Anthony a bad report that
[3618.66 - 3622.50] every part and they'll do that because
[3621.00 - 3624.15] they don't realize wait a minute no
[3622.50 - 3627.24] medical medium information is the whole
[3624.15 - 3628.80] package but yeah you can you can fix a
[3627.24 - 3630.60] lot of things with celery juice on its
[3628.80 - 3632.10] own which so does use by itself I had
[3630.60 - 3633.60] people say hit my blood pressure's fixed
[3632.10 - 3635.43] head right my aches and pains are fixed
[3633.60 - 3637.89] hey this is fixed this is fixed all day
[3635.43 - 3640.26] long people drinking celery alone by
[3637.89 - 3642.81] itself with a crappy standard American
[3640.26 - 3644.97] diet they still can fix things but with
[3642.81 - 3646.32] a lot of conditions like this were the
[3644.97 - 3648.66] ones I'm talking
[3646.32 - 3649.83] you know with this yeah and it's you you
[3648.66 - 3651.75] want to make sure you do the whole
[3649.83 - 3653.46] package because that's a thing the
[3651.75 - 3654.96] medical medium information correct me if
[3653.46 - 3661.53] I'm wrong you can totally do that
[3654.96 - 3663.93] you can set me straight you set me
[3661.53 - 3665.61] straight all right but the bottom line
[3663.93 - 3668.07] is with the medical medium information
[3665.61 - 3670.77] what I always thought from my source ok
[3668.07 - 3673.38] spirit of compassion was that it can
[3670.77 - 3675.84] take you as far as you want to go that
[3673.38 - 3678.75] it can keep on taking you as far as you
[3675.84 - 3680.61] want to go that's what it can do if you
[3678.75 - 3682.38] need to go deeper the answers are in
[3680.61 - 3685.11] these books they're in the medical
[3682.38 - 3687.39] scripture from my source so it can take
[3685.11 - 3689.16] you further and further along
[3687.39 - 3690.60] everybody's different to what's
[3689.16 - 3692.28] happening with their conditions and
[3690.60 - 3694.92] there's an answer in the books for
[3692.28 - 3696.57] everybody and for their conditions you
[3694.92 - 3698.58] just got to know how to read them and
[3696.57 - 3700.68] know how to actually get through them
[3698.58 - 3702.48] and get through the material and find
[3700.68 - 3706.91] your answers they're in there they were
[3702.48 - 3711.41] designed from my source for this you
[3706.91 - 3714.33] that's major facts and that's completely
[3711.41 - 3719.01] my personal experiences that's exactly
[3714.33 - 3721.23] what that is what anthony's knowledge
[3719.01 - 3723.39] and what liver rescue and his podcast
[3721.23 - 3726.48] episodes and what his instagram and
[3723.39 - 3728.73] social media provided for me is a
[3726.48 - 3731.16] complete anchor so everything else that
[3728.73 - 3734.73] I'm doing with the breathing exercises
[3731.16 - 3737.49] in the mornings with cold showers trying
[3734.73 - 3742.14] to just to be active surfing so the song
[3737.49 - 3746.88] sort of all of that is rooted and
[3742.14 - 3749.28] fostered because of this regimen that
[3746.88 - 3755.13] I've been able to incorporate in my life
[3749.28 - 3758.31] as a result of Anthony's information and
[3755.13 - 3759.81] one other thing that I think is worth it
[3758.31 - 3760.98] was were part of my experience that I
[3759.81 - 3764.10] think might be worth mentioning that
[3760.98 - 3765.63] people can relate to is when I had a
[3764.10 - 3768.36] ridge below I hadn't been exposed to
[3765.63 - 3770.10] Anthony's information I stopped eating
[3768.36 - 3774.12] gluten or tried to stop eating gluten
[3770.10 - 3775.83] for I think about a six month window it
[3774.12 - 3776.70] didn't help because obviously there was
[3775.83 - 3778.23] all these other things that were
[3776.70 - 3778.59] happening it was never attacking the
[3778.23 - 3781.41] intro
[3778.59 - 3785.42] thing but when Anthony offered the
[3781.41 - 3788.67] information that lutein and dairy
[3785.42 - 3791.43] actually are the food sources of
[3788.67 - 3793.38] pathogens that knowledge and another
[3791.43 - 3795.24] that knowledge is not out there I mean
[3793.38 - 3797.94] if it is it came from this source right
[3795.24 - 3800.13] because I we put it out there but it
[3797.94 - 3801.81] wasn't out there and I'm saying that
[3800.13 - 3804.15] because it mattered to you right there's
[3801.81 - 3806.01] matter no I always hope it matters to
[3804.15 - 3808.26] people that they know that because that
[3806.01 - 3810.27] piece of truth can sit I mean it can
[3808.26 - 3813.00] save people's lives it can keep them on
[3810.27 - 3814.56] track yeah it's good not to think you it
[3813.00 - 3817.08] provided a sense of purpose
[3814.56 - 3819.21] okay I'm removing gluten and dairy for
[3817.08 - 3821.34] because of this specific thing it's not
[3819.21 - 3824.52] throwing darts at a board like it might
[3821.34 - 3826.50] be an allergy it might be I have to
[3824.52 - 3828.45] interject with this right here because
[3826.50 - 3830.64] when people think out there is that
[3828.45 - 3832.23] gluten causes inflammation and that's
[3830.64 - 3835.53] why you remove it but that's nonsense
[3832.23 - 3837.45] because that that you only get
[3835.53 - 3838.91] inflammation if you have a pathogen
[3837.45 - 3841.71] that's feeding off of the gluten
[3838.91 - 3843.69] creating the inflammation because that's
[3841.71 - 3845.88] why there I know nine year olds they can
[3843.69 - 3848.43] eat all the pizza they want pizza the
[3845.88 - 3850.56] the bread they want all of them donuts
[3848.43 - 3851.61] everything wheat base and everything
[3850.56 - 3854.43] everything
[3851.61 - 3856.71] they not only I know people all over the
[3854.43 - 3858.48] world that eat all the wheat they want
[3856.71 - 3860.70] here in the US they eat it wherever they
[3858.48 - 3862.77] go all of it and it doesn't even affect
[3860.70 - 3864.15] them because they don't have a pathogen
[3862.77 - 3865.62] they don't have the strep and they don't
[3864.15 - 3868.32] have the epstein-barr the feed off of
[3865.62 - 3869.67] the gluten that information it comes
[3868.32 - 3871.23] from my source that's where it
[3869.67 - 3873.09] originated because science research
[3871.23 - 3875.25] doesn't know that pathogens eat things
[3873.09 - 3876.72] in order to make people sick they would
[3875.25 - 3878.34] rather think it's your genes they would
[3876.72 - 3880.41] or tell you you it's your genes they
[3878.34 - 3882.57] would rather tell you it's it's your
[3880.41 - 3884.49] body attacking itself so all I mean I
[3882.57 - 3886.14] see it on YouTube choose if my friends
[3884.49 - 3887.61] tell me I have friends that watch all
[3886.14 - 3889.17] the youtubes out there in health and
[3887.61 - 3891.75] they try to tell me what's going on out
[3889.17 - 3893.07] there like aw there's there's this
[3891.75 - 3894.60] person on there an influencer and
[3893.07 - 3895.71] they're saying you know they're glutens
[3894.60 - 3896.85] causing their inflammation because
[3895.71 - 3898.62] they're reading this book or whatever
[3896.85 - 3900.33] and they don't even know that it's
[3898.62 - 3902.52] because it's feeding the strep causing
[3900.33 - 3904.53] their acne and that's why they're
[3902.52 - 3907.02] getting their acnes because the strep is
[3904.53 - 3908.67] feeding off of gluten so there's you
[3907.02 - 3909.28] know no one they're all guessing right
[3908.67 - 3911.08] there
[3909.28 - 3912.34] the vegans and the Palio's or the vegans
[3911.08 - 3914.41] of the animal protein people they're all
[3912.34 - 3916.66] slinging science at each other and they
[3914.41 - 3918.43] all they don't even know what causes it
[3916.66 - 3920.29] conditions and illnesses and people tell
[3918.43 - 3921.79] me that all the time they say aw they
[3920.29 - 3923.17] don't even know what causes anything but
[3921.79 - 3924.97] there's all these experts constantly
[3923.17 - 3927.16] putting feeds out there saying this and
[3924.97 - 3929.20] this and this and the whole point I'm
[3927.16 - 3932.23] trying to say is it didn't feel good to
[3929.20 - 3933.73] be free from that because most matters
[3932.23 - 3935.68] in freedom and that's that one atoms
[3933.73 - 3936.97] life yeah medical medium information was
[3935.68 - 3938.41] always about freedom you know when
[3936.97 - 3939.82] spirit told me when I was younger and
[3938.41 - 3942.40] said you're gonna free a lot of people
[3939.82 - 3944.08] and I'm like how when I was young when I
[3942.40 - 3945.40] was a kid I was like how in what way
[3944.08 - 3947.47] like what do you how do you want me to
[3945.40 - 3949.99] free anywhere you're gonna you're gonna
[3947.47 - 3952.84] be able to message the source of it that
[3949.99 - 3954.88] the information that you don't have to
[3952.84 - 3957.12] be a prisoner to all of the belief
[3954.88 - 3959.35] systems that are built on misinformation
[3957.12 - 3961.09] and I was big words for me when I was
[3959.35 - 3962.89] younger I was like what I believe system
[3961.09 - 3965.56] what just information I was like what
[3962.89 - 3967.33] and you know and it took a while to
[3965.56 - 3971.08] figure that out I mean that how they
[3967.33 - 3973.21] think that works but I just wanna I feel
[3971.08 - 3975.43] good knowing you're freed from that
[3973.21 - 3979.03] stuff yeah and not just being like why
[3975.43 - 3980.26] stop gluten why stop dairy lactose
[3979.03 - 3982.42] intolerance first of all it's not
[3980.26 - 3985.42] lactose intolerance that doesn't exist
[3982.42 - 3988.00] it's bugs that feed off of lactose and
[3985.42 - 3989.59] create inflammation and science
[3988.00 - 3992.26] researchers and know this this is
[3989.59 - 3993.97] advanced information it's probably 30 40
[3992.26 - 3995.82] 50 years ahead of science and research
[3993.97 - 3998.74] now yeah well I'm dead and gone
[3995.82 - 4001.38] hopefully is a long time from now what
[3998.74 - 4007.77] do you say unless someone gets mad at me
[4001.38 - 4009.60] yeah and picks me off my pajamas out
[4007.77 - 4011.67] there dumping the garbage out there yeah
[4009.60 - 4013.14] in the aliens ooh but anyway your
[4011.67 - 4015.63] information is gonna live forever that's
[4013.14 - 4018.69] one thing that's funny but the bottom
[4015.63 - 4021.45] line is the bottom line is I gotta tell
[4018.69 - 4022.23] you something that you know I'm proud of
[4021.45 - 4026.34] you man
[4022.23 - 4028.53] and I'm blown away because I can do all
[4026.34 - 4030.66] the talking I want I can do all the
[4028.53 - 4032.10] talking I want because I got a big mouth
[4030.66 - 4035.52] right that's what I hear
[4032.10 - 4038.43] and but you did the work you under you
[4035.52 - 4041.28] read the book you not only did that you
[4038.43 - 4043.14] looked for help you went to you guys you
[4041.28 - 4046.29] know me Andrew went to you guys
[4043.14 - 4048.03] for help and you guys got back to him it
[4046.29 - 4050.64] blows me out of the water
[4048.03 - 4053.52] I adore you for that you don't even know
[4050.64 - 4055.56] and because you're warriors - because
[4053.52 - 4056.82] you guys are like because you you see
[4055.56 - 4058.77] the flak out there and you see the
[4056.82 - 4060.57] negativity because of everything because
[4058.77 - 4063.15] of my source and all that because you
[4060.57 - 4065.34] know no one likes a smarty aleck that
[4063.15 - 4066.21] has all the answers out there and so and
[4065.34 - 4069.51] I got it
[4066.21 - 4071.76] but you guys are staying strong and you
[4069.51 - 4073.47] were helping him you helped him and then
[4071.76 - 4075.03] and then you you're making all your
[4073.47 - 4076.32] stuff you're doing the heavy metal detox
[4075.03 - 4078.24] movie you understood the books you
[4076.32 - 4081.81] understand the supplements you also
[4078.24 - 4085.20] suffered through your condition which I
[4081.81 - 4087.54] mean like honestly you know that part
[4085.20 - 4090.39] gets me welled up inside because knowing
[4087.54 - 4093.18] that I didn't even know you mmm but yet
[4090.39 - 4095.52] knowing you were suffering like that in
[4093.18 - 4098.13] that agony it was it was debilitating it
[4095.52 - 4103.40] was the most trying those difficult
[4098.13 - 4106.68] times in my life that's 100% true but
[4103.40 - 4108.66] being able to dig myself out of that and
[4106.68 - 4110.79] being empowered and weaponized with this
[4108.66 - 4112.80] information I like that weaponize has
[4110.79 - 4114.81] been something that's leaps and bounds
[4112.80 - 4118.62] change the course of trajectory in my
[4114.81 - 4121.23] life and it just took some sacrifice and
[4118.62 - 4123.81] just as much as Anthony sacrificing so
[4121.23 - 4125.37] much of his time and his effort and
[4123.81 - 4127.05] doing all the providing all this
[4125.37 - 4129.33] information writing books doing speaking
[4127.05 - 4132.90] engagements doing podcasts doing these
[4129.33 - 4134.84] interviews you know I'm trying to
[4132.90 - 4136.80] measure up to that in a sense by
[4134.84 - 4139.47] instituting some more discipline in my
[4136.80 - 4142.29] life and sticking to these these this
[4139.47 - 4145.74] regimen with things one quick thing that
[4142.29 - 4147.87] just I just realized one thing that
[4145.74 - 4149.82] really gravitated to me that I
[4147.87 - 4153.21] gravitated to in the liver rescue book
[4149.82 - 4155.16] was when to take supplements to take
[4153.21 - 4157.50] them with a glucose source not to just
[4155.16 - 4161.04] take them on it oh my god it's it's yeah
[4157.50 - 4162.48] that's so critical no tell us about how
[4161.04 - 4165.48] big that was kind of like a big light
[4162.48 - 4166.86] bulb that went off in my head was I've
[4165.48 - 4168.63] been taking supplements without a
[4166.86 - 4171.21] glucose or I don't know if my body was
[4168.63 - 4172.71] absorbing it is that this is how it
[4171.21 - 4174.06] works so everybody out there and they're
[4172.71 - 4175.90] afraid of sugar they're afraid of fruit
[4174.06 - 4179.47] sugar so you got fruit in here I
[4175.90 - 4182.29] I mean I though their fruit fear is fear
[4179.47 - 4183.90] yeah I was I fell victim to that same
[4182.29 - 4187.57] misinformation up there there was
[4183.90 - 4189.94] there's too much sugar in apples and in
[4187.57 - 4191.98] pineapples and all the various fruits
[4189.94 - 4193.87] that I've now reincorporated into my
[4191.98 - 4195.58] regimen yeah that's that's another
[4193.87 - 4197.62] that's another misconception out there
[4195.58 - 4199.66] holding people back and that's that's
[4197.62 - 4200.98] that's how it works it's be fruit fear
[4199.66 - 4202.60] afraid of fruit and all the different
[4200.98 - 4203.74] modalities take on that fruit fear
[4202.60 - 4206.11] because they all kind of attach
[4203.74 - 4208.84] themselves to the same misdirected
[4206.11 - 4210.40] belief system and it's just gets people
[4208.84 - 4212.02] in trouble because here's how it works
[4210.40 - 4214.27] if you're taking a supplement you guys
[4212.02 - 4214.96] you say you don't like me you don't like
[4214.27 - 4217.06] what I'm saying
[4214.96 - 4218.80] regardless listen to this if you're
[4217.06 - 4220.36] taking a supplement and it's not even
[4218.80 - 4222.55] recommend it by me or anything and
[4220.36 - 4223.72] you're taking one out there you're only
[4222.55 - 4225.88] going to receive what's in that
[4223.72 - 4227.23] supplement if you have enough glucose if
[4225.88 - 4228.70] you're eating fruit in your diet if
[4227.23 - 4230.89] you're eating something with sugar in
[4228.70 - 4233.53] your diet meaning healthy sugar because
[4230.89 - 4234.97] it takes sugar to bind on to that and
[4233.53 - 4236.53] drive it into the self so if you're
[4234.97 - 4238.30] taking a supplement it takes sugar to
[4236.53 - 4239.77] bind on to that and pull it into a cell
[4238.30 - 4242.95] and that's what Andrews talking about
[4239.77 - 4244.87] right now and and it's that critical so
[4242.95 - 4246.94] nutrients and vitamins and minerals were
[4244.87 - 4248.95] taking or anything you believe in that's
[4246.94 - 4250.72] not on the medical medium directory or
[4248.95 - 4252.49] or whatever the only way you're gonna
[4250.72 - 4253.84] get something good out of it is you're
[4252.49 - 4256.30] gonna be able to draw it into yourself
[4253.84 - 4257.83] through sugar the very thing all the
[4256.30 - 4260.77] different belief systems are afraid of
[4257.83 - 4262.60] it's incredible how and worse celery
[4260.77 - 4264.52] juice is the other helper because it's
[4262.60 - 4266.47] so sodium cluster salts that bind on and
[4264.52 - 4268.39] also drive the bay bind on the sugar too
[4266.47 - 4270.13] and go to your brain they go to your
[4268.39 - 4271.57] cells it's how we build muscles and
[4270.13 - 4273.28] don't judge my muscles I'm not in the
[4271.57 - 4275.59] gym every day I'm not in the gym ever
[4273.28 - 4279.10] I've never gone into a gym and for a day
[4275.59 - 4281.71] like that ever never been in a gym but I
[4279.10 - 4286.39] ride my bicycle once in a while my
[4281.71 - 4288.04] spirits talking about okay but I'm not
[4286.39 - 4290.50] in the gym I'm working on the books I'm
[4288.04 - 4293.10] getting everybody what they need but the
[4290.50 - 4295.63] bottom line is it's the celery juice
[4293.10 - 4302.11] it's a celery juice there's something in
[4295.63 - 4304.18] this celery and you know and so yeah so

[4440.16 - 4445.35] I mean it's thing you know when I was
[4443.49 - 4446.79] when I was a kid when I was a kid I
[4445.35 - 4449.66] never thought in a million years when I
[4446.79 - 4455.21] was a kid I would be on YouTube live
[4449.66 - 4459.99] okay and I would be with Andrew Kusatsu
[4455.21 - 4462.33] in 2019 I'm you toot a lot when I was 12
[4459.99 - 4464.22] years old listening to spirit getting
[4462.33 - 4465.96] ready to do my work I'm you know doing
[4464.22 - 4468.21] my reads when I was in it in a stock boy
[4465.96 - 4470.31] ever start doing my ratings up until 14
[4468.21 - 4472.77] years old there and and I never thought
[4470.31 - 4478.41] it'd be on YouTube live in 2019 June I
[4472.77 - 4479.97] was 19 and this is just how incredible
[4478.41 - 4483.54] is talking about your x-men how you
[4479.97 - 4485.55] healed my cholesterol life is a precious
[4483.54 - 4487.11] thing it's a magical thing I want to
[4485.55 - 4490.71] think like your food your dinners yes
[4487.11 - 4493.05] yes so this is obviously my daily
[4490.71 - 4497.52] regimen and then for dinners I've just
[4493.05 - 4499.20] pretty much followed the 369 protocol as
[4497.52 - 4502.44] much to a tea as possible and that's
[4499.20 - 4504.93] been reducing my animal by-product
[4502.44 - 4507.29] intake altogether pretty much we're
[4504.93 - 4510.23] moving it out I don't really eat dairy I
[4507.29 - 4513.51] don't really eat eggs anymore it's good
[4510.23 - 4515.01] feed the virus that creates eczema
[4513.51 - 4516.09] psoriasis I'm sure that's something I've
[4515.01 - 4517.62] asked well you know I see that in
[4516.09 - 4519.03] YouTube to lick someone's tell me hey
[4517.62 - 4520.26] there's somebody eating eggs with their
[4519.03 - 4521.43] xmas rice is something like well there
[4520.26 - 4524.91] goes that option and getting better
[4521.43 - 4526.83] because you can't well that's you know
[4524.91 - 4528.51] one of the things like for eczema
[4526.83 - 4530.67] specifically it's like you can't pluck
[4528.51 - 4532.23] out like celery juice all a car and
[4530.67 - 4535.98] think that that's gonna heal you I mean
[4532.23 - 4537.51] you got to do kind of yeah he's gotta
[4535.98 - 4538.80] bring in the fruit there's no there's a
[4537.51 - 4540.66] note I want to tell you that's
[4538.80 - 4542.88] interesting with with celery juice
[4540.66 - 4544.80] whatever good you do in your life so
[4542.88 - 4546.72] you're doing all these other good pieces
[4544.80 - 4548.67] of medical medium information so reduce
[4546.72 - 4549.81] even makes it even stronger right if
[4548.67 - 4551.49] you're doing something that's not
[4549.81 - 4553.47] medical medium information that has any
[4551.49 - 4555.12] value to it and not a lot does out there
[4553.47 - 4557.10] if it has any value to it some of the
[4555.12 - 4558.36] juice will make that value rise up and
[4557.10 - 4560.58] whatever else you're doing in their life
[4558.36 - 4562.80] always remember that it enhances
[4560.58 - 4563.91] everything so but it's not the fix all
[4562.80 - 4566.01] for certain problems but it enhances
[4563.91 - 4568.56] everything you're doing making it more
[4566.01 - 4571.11] powerful that you're doing good yeah so
[4568.56 - 4572.31] so but so your dinners go back to that
[4571.11 - 4574.71] right so I
[4572.31 - 4576.81] a lot of those things and I've brought
[4574.71 - 4579.54] in I've been making a lot of like soups
[4576.81 - 4581.91] i steamed sweet potatoes i steamed
[4579.54 - 4582.66] aggressive potatoes i make like a salad
[4581.91 - 4585.48] on the side
[4582.66 - 4587.16] i've been doing a lot of like a
[4585.48 - 4589.65] Mediterranean kind of inspiration with
[4587.16 - 4591.69] like based with a tomato Persian
[4589.65 - 4593.64] cucumber onion and then I'll add like
[4591.69 - 4596.13] some olives or some artichoke hearts
[4593.64 - 4598.05] some avocado to switch it up because it
[4596.13 - 4600.90] get kind of boring or whatever but so
[4598.05 - 4603.45] that I do steamed potatoes yams sweet
[4600.90 - 4606.12] potatoes and then I'll make like soups I
[4603.45 - 4608.97] did a zucchini soup last night super
[4606.12 - 4613.44] easy it was garlic onion zucchini some
[4608.97 - 4615.51] vegetable stock some coconut milk I've
[4613.44 - 4618.78] been doing squash soup so I gave the
[4615.51 - 4622.35] kombucha or kombucha kombucha squash to
[4618.78 - 4625.44] squash the kombucha tea kombucha tea if
[4622.35 - 4627.21] you want actually heal an ailment I have
[4625.44 - 4629.07] nothing against kombucha tea but it's
[4627.21 - 4632.01] it's it's not it doesn't help people
[4629.07 - 4634.23] heal actual conditions and yeah real
[4632.01 - 4637.05] conditions so I use your recipe for that
[4634.23 - 4638.61] squash soup and then I did another one
[4637.05 - 4641.09] like a week or two later and just did
[4638.61 - 4647.25] butternut squash instead of the common
[4641.09 - 4649.52] kombucha squash it's gonna be confused
[4647.25 - 4651.87] yeah you got kombucha squash delicata
[4649.52 - 4653.58] toppling all the squashes to the winter
[4651.87 - 4656.34] squash and you know everybody up in
[4653.58 - 4658.05] North in North America or wherever were
[4656.34 - 4658.38] any luck I mean different parts of the
[4658.05 - 4660.45] country
[4658.38 - 4661.80] planet did the winter squash is out
[4660.45 - 4663.18] right now right yeah I mean it's
[4661.80 - 4667.47] everywhere it's and caps and all the
[4663.18 - 4669.03] Trader Joe's Buttercup butternut what
[4667.47 - 4673.71] else about doing like vegetable stir
[4669.03 - 4675.54] fries you know I do eat meat once in a
[4673.71 - 4677.13] while but I've really kind of made a
[4675.54 - 4678.60] conscious effort to really just kind of
[4677.13 - 4680.34] limit that I want it's awesome talk
[4678.60 - 4682.08] about that for a second t you know and
[4680.34 - 4683.76] medical medium information isn't just
[4682.08 - 4685.91] one way it's not just all plant-based
[4683.76 - 4688.47] it's not just all raw plant-based vegan
[4685.91 - 4690.51] vegetarian it's not just all paleo or
[4688.47 - 4692.22] animal protein or keto or all that so
[4690.51 - 4693.63] it's not any of that it's about the
[4692.22 - 4695.34] right information you could bring into
[4693.63 - 4696.99] what you're doing when to deal with
[4695.34 - 4699.03] eczema psoriasis you do want your animal
[4696.99 - 4700.35] products lower bottom line you want them
[4699.03 - 4701.76] low you don't want the dairy products
[4700.35 - 4702.96] you don't want the eggs you don't want
[4701.76 - 4703.71] the milk the butter cheese you don't
[4702.96 - 4705.84] want any
[4703.71 - 4707.58] bad for it you know and you want your
[4705.84 - 4710.34] fats down lower it's not even about
[4707.58 - 4711.87] animal products being bad you just want
[4710.34 - 4713.70] a lower animal products you want to
[4711.87 - 4715.38] lower your plant fats your animal fats
[4713.70 - 4717.57] because that's what it is if you're
[4715.38 - 4719.55] eating an animal protein it's animal fat
[4717.57 - 4722.13] so that's what that is it's animal fat
[4719.55 - 4724.20] if you're eating a plant protein usually
[4722.13 - 4726.60] a lot of that is just powders that are
[4724.20 - 4728.43] that are designed off whatever but plant
[4726.60 - 4731.88] fats if you're eating too many avocados
[4728.43 - 4733.47] olives olive oil nut butter sesame oils
[4731.88 - 4735.15] peanut butters almond butters if you're
[4733.47 - 4736.50] doing too many of that with the vegan
[4735.15 - 4738.27] diet you're not going to get your
[4736.50 - 4740.82] psoriasis but your excellence rises
[4738.27 - 4742.35] better if you're doing animal products
[4740.82 - 4744.06] and it's too much animal print get the
[4742.35 - 4745.65] pork just too much fat in it too much
[4744.06 - 4748.14] chicken too much chicken fat so you just
[4745.65 - 4749.91] want to keep down your fats if you're
[4748.14 - 4751.47] gonna get excellence rises better that's
[4749.91 - 4753.42] one of the key components see there's no
[4751.47 - 4755.04] belief system here it's not about that
[4753.42 - 4757.83] it's just about the right information
[4755.04 - 4759.87] it's not about the diet belief system
[4757.83 - 4761.49] that everybody banks on and starts
[4759.87 - 4762.33] believing and then they fight for when
[4761.49 - 4763.62] they don't even know why they're even
[4762.33 - 4766.20] fighting for it about what causes
[4763.62 - 4767.91] illness so it's not about that it's
[4766.20 - 4769.50] about making sure your fats come down
[4767.91 - 4772.29] when it comes down to healing something
[4769.50 - 4779.79] like this and and then it's been crazy I
[4772.29 - 4782.07] mean I'm I'm about to be 37 I just met
[4779.79 - 4784.89] you so yeah I haven't known you or any
[4782.07 - 4790.91] so I thought you're in your 20s I mean
[4784.89 - 4793.77] that's a major compliment but I'm 20
[4790.91 - 4796.05] anyway well that's a Google set yo
[4793.77 - 4800.79] that's like a thing that likes Kreutz of
[4796.05 - 4809.37] people it's like that now he's talking
[4800.79 - 4813.80] to five forty years okay sure he's 20
[4809.37 - 4813.80] years already a liar right there
[4814.96 - 4821.77] yeah yeah anyway I just haven't felt I
[4818.38 - 4823.60] haven't felt this good in my life I mean
[4821.77 - 4826.12] just in terms of energy strength I mean
