1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,000
oral health it's a big deal a lot of

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,400
people have canker sores cold sores

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,320
fever blisters mouth ulcers oh it's just

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,960
a mouth ulcer that's all it is just a

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,920
mouth ulcer you know it's like well

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,680
what's a mouth ulcer what is

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,240
that what's a mouth ulcer right and

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,160
we'll talk about all this kind of stuff

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,320
talking about immune system inside the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,279
mouth which is a big deal so your immune

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,840
system in your mouth one of the most

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,800
important places our immune system is

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,600
when lymphocytes are freaking out every

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,120
day in our mouths because they're trying

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,360
to protect us they all this different

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,840
stuff going in our mouths lymphocytes

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,719
are always at it lymphatic glands

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,199
underneath our neck right all these

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,199
different areas here so this is really a

20
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,120
uh an important topic because so many

21
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:54,960
people have not just oral health issues

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,600
but immune system issues in the area of

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,039
their oral health because that's really

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
a big problem right there so it's the

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,040
immune

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,040
system in the area where oral health is

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,080
and they both work together okay we're

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,520
going to talk about the whole stuff

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
mouthwashes bad bad bad bad bad you

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
don't want to use all those toxic

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,560
mouthwashes out there I've been saying

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,799
that for years because this stuff is

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,119
terrible it's like putting gasoline in

34
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,680
your mouth it's basically like just

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,360
sucking gasoline from a gas tank out of

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,520
a hose what you see here and then

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,119
rinsing out your your mouth and then

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,240
spitting it out that's what it is

39
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,159
basically good to see you guys oral

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,960
health we're talking about okay so this

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,119
is a big deal this is a show that's

42
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,320
important worth watching worth watching

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,560

people in so many ways what you also see

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,280
in front of me is

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,160
propolis

53
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,920
propolis yeah yeah the heavens open up

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,640

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:24,319
sky because propolis is literally

critical seriously important

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,960

excited because we're talking about the

119
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,960
immune system I'm excited because we're

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,600
talking about oral health it it's a

121
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,240
favorite topic of mine I love talking

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,199
about it because when you get people

123
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,000
help when you actually get them real

124
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,080
help where they where they can do

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,080
something that's really beneficial not

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,600
just [ __ ] coconut oil you know oil

127
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,520
pulling I'm sorry I hope I just didn't

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,800
make 10 more enemies you know I mean I'm

129
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,880
the original enemy maker in the health

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,840
movement because I told people about the

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,680
collagen bull crap I told them about the

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,360
oil pulling I told them about the lectin

133
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,440
scam so I'm the original enemy maker

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,039
before people now or like shot and all

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
like blah blah blah blah blah blah in

136
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,759
the health you know in the health world

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,919
right now screaming their heads off

138
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,000
about every little thing right but what

139
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,520
happened was earlier on you know I I

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,360
don't think I made that many friends

141
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,520
when you're ripping apart collagen

142
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,120
supplements fish oil supplements and

143
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,520
you're ripping apart all that garbage

144
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,400
and all that junk you just don't make a

145
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,520
lot of friends

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,479
anyway the point I'm trying to say is

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,360
oil pulling does not do anything for the

148
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,479
mouth's immune system it doesn't it may

149
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,479
make your mouth feel a little slippery

150
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,319
your teeth feel a little slippery you

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,440
know it might feel good rubbing your

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,520
your tongue across your teeth your front

153
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,800
teeth and be like w oil pulling but it

154
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,599
can't hold a candle a candle to

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
something like prop especially the right

156
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,120
kind of propolis because there's

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,720
propolis with alcohol this propolis

158
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,120
doesn't have alcohol in it you can find

159
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,639
propolis out there it'll say alcohol

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,599
free but there's still alcohol in it

161
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,240
they're allowed to do that because they

162
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,759
keep it down a little bit right you the

163
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,880
Mars info I know I know it blew my mind

164
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,720
blew my mind asking Spirit of

165
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,520
compassion but what happens is the oil

166
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,680
pulling isn't effective the mouthwashes

167
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,919
aren't effective either and a lot of the

168
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,319
mouthwashes that the natural ones there

169
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,240
there's all kinds of crap in there and

170
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,360
they're not effective for immune system

171
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,759
health for your oral

172
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,479
needs but propolis is one of those

173
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,560
miracles on the planet and when it's

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,800
done

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,680
right it's done right and that's the

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,479
difference right so the pure propolis

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,039
right there is is a whole another level

178
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,879
it's just so incredible so that's it

179
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,199
right there the vimergy one but so let's

180
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,000
go into propus a little bit let's go

181
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,280
into oral health like what's going on in

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,120
people's mouth

183
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,199

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,919
cold sorce you got herp Simplex

185
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,560
2 yeah herp simplex one herp Simplex too

186
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,879
in people's mouths some people got two

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,160
varieties of cold sores they'll have a

188
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,280
fever blister that looks a little

189
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,680
different does something a little

190
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,240
different and then they'll have like

191
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,479
cold sores on the outside of their

192
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,520
mouth then they'll have cold sores in

193
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,520
their

194
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,599
nose fever blisters in their nose it's a

195
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,280
herpes simplex one or two and the key is

196
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,199
immune system for battling that that's a

197
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,479
big

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,120
deal immune system so if you guys just

199
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,360
got on here we're doing a little oral

200
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,120
health talk which is so needed for

201
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,960
people I don't want to forget about it

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
time goes by a lot happens there's a lot

203
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,720
going on I'm releasing a book pretty

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,560
pretty soon there's there's a lot of

205
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,240
things going on and but I just you know

206
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,360
I just have to make sure I'm a

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,199
reminder about what this can do and

208
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,120
about what propolis can do and golden

209
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,479
seal and zinc and how important these

210
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,240
things are so we're here we're live

211
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,880
right now okay so let's cut into it

212
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,560
right here okay so gums that recede

213
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,440
because bacteria that's not good is

214
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,839
working on them and trying to break them

215
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,760
down and try to eat away at them so

216
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,080
that's one thing that happens receding

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,600
gums they get real thin they start to

218
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,680
break down they start to right they

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,760
start to Decay one of the reasons why

220
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,880
for receding gums one of the

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,560
reasons is people have a lot of metals

222
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,000
in their system they got mercury in

223
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,880
their system they got mercury in their

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,519
gums that's sitting in there they got

225
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
mercury in their

226
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,240
tongue people have mercury in their

227
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,800
tongue yeah they do like if people's

228
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,760
tongues were dissected if people's

229
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,360
tongues were when when someone dies and

230
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,880
if they did this thing where they remove

231
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,440
the tongue instead of cut instead of

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,760
cutting open the brain and and

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
pretending they actually are looking

234
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,680
inside somebody's

235
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,320
brain which which really they don't

236
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,000
terrible I mean they they slice the

237
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,160
brains when they do the experiments

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,839
right when someone donates their brain

239
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,120
to science or science buys it without

240
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,440
them knowing did you hear about that

241
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,959
lately did you hear about that because

242
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,680
I've heard about it for decades where

243
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,200
people and don't know it but their

244
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,519
bodies get sold off if they say it's by

245
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,399
accident their bodies get sold off yeah

246
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,519
like they'll sell a torso

247
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,720
of a girl for $600 they'll sell a head

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,959
yeah a head for

249
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,160
$300 they'll sell two legs for

250
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,440
like a $100 a piece $50 a piece to

251
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,399
science I mean I don't I don't know

252
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,680
anything more deranged I don't there's a

253
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,920
lot of reasons why that's totally

254
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,680
deranged but it's true and it happens

255
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,720
it's happening every day just just you

256
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,279
know

257
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,959
we're let's bring it back bring it back

258
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:36,720
to to oral health please yeah so what

259
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,120
happens is that when they slice a brain

260
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,600
okay they they slice it open like you

261
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,880
know when you put a um you go to the

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,480
deli and they

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,040
put a big slab of you know some cold

264
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,959
cuts right and you get cold cuts at a

265
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,839
deli and they're slicing it can I have

266
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,440
that slice thin please and they set the

267
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,839
cutter they set the cutter some like 0

268
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,880
10 or something like that and they slice

269
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,320
it thin well they do that with brains

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
and they start looking for stuff they

271
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,000
start taking a look at things what they

272
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,360
really need to to do is they need to

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,079
take tongues and they need to do that

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,240
with tongues they need to actually test

275
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,560
what's in tongues tongues get really

276
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:21,680
really toxic really dirty and really

277
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,880
toxic that's why eating tongue like beef

278
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,600
tongue is ridiculously stupid eating

279
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,120
beef tongue unless it's all you have

280
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,360
it's if it's all you have and you live

281
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,720
in some country somewhere and you're

282
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,959
like you're really dead poor and it's

283
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,880
either that or eating dirt then yeah

284
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,959
then I completely understand you eat a

285
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,839
beef tongue you eat a cow tongue I

286
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,959
understand I am not shaming anybody or

287
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,320
saying don't you know don't ever do that

288
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,399
or anything like that I'm just saying if

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,639
you have the ability not to do that if

290
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,680
you have access to some resources and

291
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,639
access to some food don't eat a beef

292
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,839
tongue a cow

293
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,399
tongue don't highly talk toxic highly

294
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,760
filled with you toxic heavy metals you

295
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,360
got to watch out with organ Meats organ

296
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,800
meats are the worst if you're an animal

297
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,320
protein person stick with the regular

298
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,199
animal protein stick with that I'm just

299
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,079
saying if you're an an I support you if

300
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,360
you're an animal protein person I

301
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,519
support you if you're eating all these

302
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,639
toxic organs too of course I support you

303
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,639
because I just I just want to offer

304
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,360
whatever I can to add to whatever you're

305
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,560
doing even if you're doing something

306
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:35,480
wrong yeah sorry

307
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:38,120
wrong but the organ meets are oh my God

308
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,600
the trend is insane talking about

309
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,839
getting somebody so toxic so fast in

310
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,440
their life if you're somebody and you're

311
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,279
starting out Young on organ meets like

312
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
you're starting out at 15 years old or

313
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,279
something or 14 years old and your

314
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
family's feeding you organ meats and

315
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,959
you're starting out that young oh dear

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,240
lord nobody knows nobody knows and then

317
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,120
10 years go by 15 years go by the

318
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,000
toxicity level in a child that turns

319
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,760
into a young adult that turns into an

320
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,360
older adult the toxicity level is so off

321
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,440
the chart compared to um if you're going

322
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,360
to have grass bed beef from a certain

323
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:19,639
cut you know what I mean muscle from a

324
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,920
certain cut right versus if you eat beef

325
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,519
Hearts I mean for Animals it's different

326
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,079
you need want to feed your dog grass fed

327
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
beef Hearts you know it's it's different

328
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,800
but but it for humans to be eating all

329
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,000
the beef hearts and beef liver oh my God

330
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,720
and cow liver and cow tongue and cow

331
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,760
heart cow what a freaking nightmare to

332
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,880
the body and they don't even know nobody

333
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,839
even knows they don't even have a clue

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,079
the organ meat thing is utterly

335
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,440
ridiculous I'm not trying to be a jerk

336
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,880
or anything that's not what I'm trying

337
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,160
to do I'm just trying to be the voice of

338
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,279
reason the voice of reason you know

339
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,959
Advanced information I know Trends take

340
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,959
people down all kinds of rabbit holes

341
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
and then they're doing it they're

342
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,399
getting clicks and likes and they're

343
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,800
getting all this play out there and

344
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,079
they're they're like you know moving and

345
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,040
grooving and then they're they're

346
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,240
pushing all their organs organ meat

347
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,720
stuff and whatever it is I get it I get

348
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,759
it

349
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:17,440
but never never never

350
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:20,880
never would I eat beef liver never great

351
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
way to intoxification

352
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,199
right it's in grass-fed beef it's in

353
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,560
small small mounts but it's in there

354
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,160
it's it's in everything it's in

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
everything this isn't an anti-animal

356
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,759
talk that's not it if your animal

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,720
protein stick with the regular animal

358
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,680
proteins meaning grass-fed or something

359
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,040
really good you know if you raise your

360
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,040
own cows whatever and just the point is

361
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,560
stick with with the regular thing and

362
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm saying this

363
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,240
because you start eating tongues and

364
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,639
livers and hearts and other organs too

365
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
you spleen what whatever you start

366
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,519
eating these and you're going to just

367
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,000
intoxicate yourself at a rapid Pace at a

368
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:10,120
Mach one level so we're back to oral

369
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
health I apolog my apologies truly and

370
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,759
this isn't an anti-animal protein thing

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,199
at all and it's not an anti- plant-based

372
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,519
thing too I say a lot of things about

373
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,680
the plant-based eaters and the vegan the

374
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,759
vegan eaters and stuff like that because

375
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,759
they do things wrong and they they don't

376
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,000
know it but they're intoxicating

377
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,759
themselves and that's just it that's

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,160
even a word intoxic ating okay let's go

379
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,759
into oral health a little bit so tongues

380
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,040
are toxic they are and it's hard on our

381
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,440
immune system when we have these toxic

382
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,560
tongues very hard on our immune system

383
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,360
in our mouth in our mouth area lymphatic

384
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,120
vessels lymphatic system the whole bit

385
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,600
there's a tongue right here um they take

386
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,360
a look right there there's a tongue you

387
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,040
see it's right underneath the eyeball I

388
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,600
don't know if you could see that on IG

389
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,360
how about on Tik Tok you guys see that

390
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,440
on there so there's a tongue okay our

391
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,120
immune system is guarding our tongue we

392
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,199
have a lot of immune cells in our tongue

393
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,959
and there's a reason for that tongues

394
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
get attacked tongues get a lot of

395
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,319
cancers tongues get a lot of different

396
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
herpes viruses tongues get different

397
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,920
kinds of bacteria you know infested in

398
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,920
them so it's a big part of how our

399
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,079
immune system is always like under a

400
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,240
battle under a war in a war it's a big

401
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:39,279
part of it tongue gets toxic okay for

402
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,560
multitudes of reasons one is it's highly

403
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,000
absorbent things we put in our mouth can

404
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,920
go into a

405
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,600
tongue faster than they stick around in

406
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,680
the

407
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,440
bowel that's right faster than they

408
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,000
stick around in the bow you ready for

409
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,639
this too something can absorb in the

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
tongue that's toxic that you're eating

411
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,360
or something like that say you're eating

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,439
some tuna then you're doing like the

413
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,039
Mercury thing you're eating tuna tuna I

414
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,520
I got a friend that says I'm I'm eating

415
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,679
this wild cot tuna I said really you

416
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,679
like

417
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,240
Mercury

418
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,280
so what happens is say you're eating

419
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,959
that tuna right well your tongue will

420
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,120
absorb the Mercury

421
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,120
first uh-huh uh-huh it will it will

422
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,120
absorb the Mercury

423
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,960
first before guess what your liver and

424
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
your liver is going to absorb it next it

425
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,840
is it's going to go down in this the

426
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,559
stomach and down in the dadum down the

427
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,160
small intestinal tract down in the guts

428
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,919
it is and then it's going to be absorbed

429
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,440
it's going to go up the hepatic portal

430
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,640
Highway into the liver into your liver

431
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,360
right your liver is just going to suck

432
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,039
it up and absorb it up whatever it is

433
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,679
and take it all in but your tongue had

434
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,840
first divs first

435
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,600
divs another thing interesting your

436
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,720
tongue has to have a lot of blood it has

437
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,240
to have a lot of blood flow lots of

438
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,360
blood flow you guys Lots because it has

439
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,400
lots of it has it has that hyper blood

440
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,320
flow in your tongue somebody gets their

441
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,200
tongue

442
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,640
pierced I mean there's nothing wrong

443
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,480
with that and someone wants to do that

444
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,159
it's up to whoever wants to do that but

445
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,400
it's a shock to the tongue because the

446
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,760
immune system needs the tongue just kind

447
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,120
of left alone and you know doing what it

448
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,200
needs to do you know I had another

449
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,799
friend who had their tongue pierced many

450
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,559
years ago and I told them you should

451
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:37,080
take that piercing out and just let it

452
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,679
heal just let it heal you know but if to

453
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,360
each to each their own people do what

454
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,640
they want to do I mean I'm not judging

455
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,760
anybody it is what it is but the

456
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,320
tongue is

457
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,760
inherently

458
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,760
vascular it just is so what that means

459
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,640
is it

460
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,440
pulls

461
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,720
pulls what that word is it means that

462
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,200
the blood pulls there does it pulls

463
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,960
there a lot and then it drops off a lot

464
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
of toxins our tongues get toxic our

465
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,559
tongues get toxic just like our livers

466
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,159
get toxic they just get toxic so not

467
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,559
only do tongues absorb when you eat

468
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,880
something so if you're eating like uh

469
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,080
tuna fish and the Mercury will go into

470
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,200
your tongue it'll actually enter it and

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,000
stay in

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
there but here's the other thing you

473
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,400
think the tongue is

474
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,919
vascular

475
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
hypervascular what about the heart

476
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,480
that's why I tell people you're into all

477
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,159
kinds of like organ meats and stuff like

478
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,600
that do not eat Hearts they're so toxic

479
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,640
so toxic because they're so

480
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,200
vascular and and the toxins pull there

481
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,559
you know this really a rough one I mean

482
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
you know people don't know but again

483
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,919
it's all about the trends Trends Trends

484
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,440
not about really people healing in the

485
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,080
end it's about the trends and then when

486
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,480
the trends don't really work or they die

487
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,120
out or they shift then it's on to a new

488
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:02,000
trend but it's not about people healing

489
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,840
it's sad it's

490
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,280
sad Lena what about dental fillings same

491
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
as with tuna of course if you got the

492
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,559
mums if you got the the silver fillings

493
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,080
and stuff if you had the silver fillings

494
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,280
yeah I mean absorbs into the tongue

495
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
absolutely our tongues get toxic it

496
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,799
absorbs things and then our immune

497
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,120
system gets compromised in our mouths

498
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,520
but our immune systems get compromised

499
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:30,440
in everybody's mouth it's also why the

500
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,559
herpes viruses are so Vigilant they're

501
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,159
so so hyper

502
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,559
catchy that some people catch them boom

503
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,200
they got it some people it takes two

504
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,600
years right you're smooching with

505
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,799
someone whatever and you're on the

506
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,640
dating scene and then everything seems

507
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,080
okay you don't have anything nothing's

508
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,080
happening whatever next thing you know

509
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,120
it you know two years later you break

510
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,679
out with your first cold sore you're at

511
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,720
the doctor that's a cold sore that's a

512
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,799
fever blister came from the date two

513
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,120
years ago it just happens right depends

514
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,600
on your immune system too sometimes and

515
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,520
it depends on what kind of varieties of

516
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
bugs we're talking about now if you guys

517
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,720
came on here we're talking about the

518
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,240
propolis we're talking about the zinc

519
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,360
we're talking about especially the

520
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,919
propolis too oh my God I can't talk

521
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,240
enough about it and the golden

522
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,039
seal we're talking about

523
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,360
those there's a lot of different

524
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,600
varieties of HH you know hvs1 herpy

525
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
simplex

526
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,480
one lots of different varieties of

527
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,919
Herpes Simplex 2 and people get them in

528
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,679
their mouth first and they get them

529
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,840
there

530
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,600
and they battle this and it comes

531
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
out some people get two or three you

532
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,120
know over time just because you got

533
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,200
fever blisters doesn't mean you're not

534
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,000
going to catch another fever blister

535
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,120
that's the other thing too just because

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,400
you caught one six years ago doesn't

537
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,760
mean you're not going to catch another

538
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,240
from somebody else and it's a different

539
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,559
variety so now you got two one pops up

540
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,120
this month one pops up that month one

541
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,960
pops up this month you really don't know

542
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,600
the difference one pops up another month

543
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,559
that's why like oral health is critical

544
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,720
oral immune system health is

545
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,200
critical I'm not on here right now to

546
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,520
have some fun I got a lot going on it's

547
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,760
just that I feel a

548
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,039
responsibility

549
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,520
so let's talk about oral health a little

550
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,880
bit more when it comes down to immune

551
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,120
system so lymphatic

552
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,640
vessels lymphatic

553
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,520
lands down there in the neck that's a

554
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,799
hot spot that is such a hot spot right

555
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,880
there the neck the glands lymphatic

556
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,400
glands all around the neck back of the

557
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,120
neck bottom of the you know the base of

558
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,240
the

559
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,000
head your throat all of it and then we

560
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,880
got our tonsils too so we got our

561
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,840
tonsils if you still have them if you

562
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,120
still have your tonsils but I get it a

563
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,039
lot of people still don't have their

564
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,320
tonsils they lost their tonsils a long

565
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,480
time ago

566
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,440
because of immune system challenges they

567
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,760
had chronic strep and maybe didn't even

568
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,159
know they had chronic strep maybe they

569
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,200
were diagnosed with strep throat one

570
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,480
time but they didn't know they had

571
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,919
chronic strep for so long

572
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,919
um tonsilitis tonsils being inflamed

573
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,600
tonsils being swollen all this matters

574
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,320
with oral health with gums and teeth

575
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,400
gums and

576
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,559
teeth and tongues a lot of people have M

577
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,799
mouth ulcers they have them on their

578
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,720
tongue they get canker swords on their

579
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,440
tongue and they hurt like heck and they

580
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,200
bite their teeth into it they're like

581
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,120
trying to bite them like and they're

582
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,320
biting them a lot of people do that

583
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,559
they're biting their

584
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,159
tongue um rightfully so so that's

585
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,000
another thing that people go through so

586
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
our immune system is heavily challenged

587
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
and it showcases itself through oral

588
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,279
health tongue health and then what about

589
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,799
crinkles crinkle tongue crinkle tongue

590
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,120
Sahara Desert tongue

591
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,480
right so the whole thing thing with the

592
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,159
tongue and and crinkling and getting the

593
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,600
lines in it and all of that too you know

594
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,760
and a lot of people are like well you

595
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,279
know it's you go to somebody you go to

596
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,520
you know Chinese medicine or you go you

597
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,520
know Oriental medicine or you go to um

598
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,440
atic you know medicine or whatever and

599
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,000
you're going to you know you're doing a

600
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,080
all that and you're going to different

601
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,760
practitioners NDS herbalists right

602
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,000
acupuncturists and they're just like oh

603
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,320
I'm looking at your

604
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,960
tongue you know you got liver heat

605
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,559
looking at your tongue and you got this

606
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,480
but here's another thing people don't

607
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,600
realize your

608
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,279
tongue it's not just coming from your

609
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,039
gut or your liver or anything like that

610
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,919
and showcasing signs of

611
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,039
that your tongue itself is challenged

612
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,760
challenged on immune system levels it's

613
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,799
challenged orally you're challenged on

614
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,520
an immune system oral

615
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,480
health and you could be getting healthy

616
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,080
kicking butt getting rid of you could be

617
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,320
doing medical medium stuff you're doing

618
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,960
medical medium stuff you're getting rid

619
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,240
of neurological symptoms you're moving

620
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,679
forward and you're kicking butt and

621
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,360
you're healing and you're just you're

622
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,679
you're you're crushing it you knocked

623
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,039
out 40 symptoms and you're moving

624
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,799
forward and you can still have a beat up

625
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,720
tongue for quite a while because

626
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,480
sometimes the tongues are the last to

627
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,240
heal sometimes the tongues are the last

628
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,080
to heal deep seated tongue issues right

629
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
the

630
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,640
grooves all all of

631
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,120
that sometimes that takes time and it

632
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,520
could take you it could take years

633
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,679
tongue could be tongues are some of the

634
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,320
most toxic things in our body next to

635
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,480
our hearts yeah our hearts really toxic

636
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,799
our livers really toxic and our brains

637
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,799
really

638
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,399
toxic down the road they're going to

639
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,840
offer programs it's going to be closer

640
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:55,080
to more closer to ending times but it's

641
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,600
was talking the spirit of compassion and

642
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,360
spirit of compassion is closer we get to

643
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,679
ending times down down the road there

644
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,799
going to be offering programs where you

645
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,760
know you just you not only do you are

646
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,159
you like an organ donor you have an

647
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,840
organ organ donor card but you also have

648
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,880
an organ feeder card so because there's

649
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,799
going to be all kinds of problems with

650
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,120
crops and the Food Supplies are going to

651
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,000
dim down because of toxicity and

652
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,679
everything else down way way way way in

653
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,880
the future and

654
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,360
um they're going to be offering people

655
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,000
who pass away offering organs for being

656
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,120
consumed because the food supply is

657
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,520
going to be so scarce um I think I'm

658
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,840
going to do something about that or talk

659
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,279
something about that that's really

660
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,399
intense

661
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,200
stuff but anyway tongues are going to be

662
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,039
on the menu is what I'm trying to say

663
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,399
and that's where I was going they will

664
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:50,000
be on the menu and it won't be just cow

665
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:54,840
tongue all right

666
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,840

you want a little window into me about

672
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,440
stuff most people healed on the planet

673
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,240
outside of any single protocol or belief

674
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
system or Diet belief system or whatever

675
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,080
it is you want to call it out there a

676
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,679
trend most people healed and the most

677
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,559
most people around the planet around the

678
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,080
globe

679
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:32,080
healing the most the most most attacked

680
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,919
because of it but the most and that's

681
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,520
special and because of s so not because

682
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,159
of me I'm just a messenger so let's talk

683
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,720
about the pro propolis and everything so

684
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,559
if you if you're

685
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,240
here let's learn about the propolis I

686
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,360
got a little shot glass here and um I

687
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,279
might do something kind of funny here I

688
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,720
might put a little bit of this tea water

689
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,399
in

690
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,919
there so I want to talk about how to

691
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,240
apply to canker sores cold soures mouth

692
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,000
ulcers so here's what you do even though

693
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,640
I got this little shot glass out there

694
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
because you can put it in there too if

695
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,919
you don't like the taste The Taste is

696
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,600
actually good in my opinion The Taste is

697
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,440
great in my opinion okay so you got I

698
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,679
got the propolis right here so applying

699
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,840
it you apply it right on the source

700
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,559
that's what I tell all people I know

701
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,399
that are dealing with anything right on

702
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:34,600
the sore droing a little bit right out

703
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:36,480
of the thing you put it on the soore

704
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,159
okay but I well here's the best way

705
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,760
doing it that's the lazy way lazy way of

706
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:47,440
doing it you take a paper towel or or a

707
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,360
wash cloth that's dry and

708
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,760
clean not one that's been used for all

709
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:57,279
kinds of things you take a was washcloth

710
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,000
or a paper towel on the inside of the

711
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:05,360
mouth you just dry that canker sore dry

712
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,720
it yes dry it so you just go tap tap tap

713
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,880
you know you take that paper towel you

714
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,559
go you you dab it you dry the

715
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,320
sore it could be a sore on your gum it

716
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,640
could be a canker sore on your gum on

717
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,919
your tongue it could be a blister from a

718
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,200
cold sore which is different herpes cold

719
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,480
sores are different than canker

720
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,600
sores right or that area line you know

721
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,440
what I'm talking about the lines

722
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,200
so what about the ker swur lines sharp

723
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,640
Jagged pain in the inside of the mouth

724
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,960
right the lines you know you feel them

725
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,559
and there's like lines on the side of

726
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,320
your mouth you're like the heck where'

727
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,679
those lines come from and the lines are

728
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,559
there right people have this all day

729
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,399

system in the

770
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,200

771
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,159
something that you

kinds bad

782
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:03,039
bacteria you put propolis in your mouth

783
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,600
as your mouth wash or mouth rinse but

784
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,799
just swallow it because it's your

785
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,200
propolis what it can do for your oral

786
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,200
health if this what I was trying to say

787
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,639
oil pulling it's not that a lot of

788
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,760
people are even doing oil pulling

789
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,960
anymore oil pulling is

790
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,639
ridonculous

791
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,240
compared to using propolis now keep in

792
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:28,039
mind this is the vimergy propolis I

793
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,480
endorse these guys for a reason because

794
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,960
nothing touches that stuff it has a

795
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,480
living coratin in

796
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,480
it I mean polyphenols a whole bit has a

797
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,320
living cortin in it it's not like dead

798
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,000
coratin it's living coratin inside there

799
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,919
I mean that's a whole another story

800
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,240
about why this propolis is so incredible

801
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,080
so what you see it's in the middle out

802
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,760
of these three it's the propolis pure

803
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,600

whatever that might be and you have that

887
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,839
propolis should be there and one should

888
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,760
be in your bathroom for cold sores and

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,640
in your mouth you can put it on your

892
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,599

893
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,280
put a squirt of it in your mouth and let

894
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,280
it just mole around for 30 seconds you

895
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,560
can do a dropper full and let it mole

896
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,200
around for 30 seconds seconds or a

897
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,880
minute in your mouth let it just absorb

898
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,359
into the immune system so the immune

899
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,480
system can use it and Gobble it up that

900
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:12,000
incredible living coratin that's in

901
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,400
there what what like God's Gift really

902
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,760
the problem is with propolis is out

903
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,079
there they're polluted they're burnt

904
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,240
they don't have those those um

905
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,000
phytochemical compounds that are active

906
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,839
because alcohol's been put in there and

907
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,119
alcohol just kills every phytochemical

908
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:29,520
compound that's why the alcohol world

909
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,480
inting Ure world it's it's it's dying

910
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,280
because medical medium exposed that

911
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,599
medical medium exposed that tincture

912
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,720
should not have alcohol in them it

913
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,680
should not have that corn grain alcohol

914
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,400
in them I mean oh my God that was

915
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,560
happening for years and years and years

916
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,880
and I don't care like grape

917
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,720
alcohol still not good still not good oh

918
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,480
yeah no this is grape alcohol this isn't

919
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,319
corn grain alcohol like you know they

920
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,920
use in a lot of supplements uh I don't

921
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:00,640
care still not good bad idea bad idea

922
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,520
still kills everything still kills the

923
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,400
phytochemical compound so the vimergy

924
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,440
stuff they won't do that they won't play

925
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,280
with

926
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,560
that they they instead put together a

927
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,480
propolis that doesn't have that it's

928
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,599
just you can't like can't get any better

929
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
than that

930
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,560
so

931
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,040
cavities cavities okay what I love about

932
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,599
propolis is it's a great thing to keep

933
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,240
the mouth's immune system strong because

934
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,680
cavities can be something that's really

935
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,079
annoying see a lot of people have toxic

936
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,800
they're high and toxic heavy metals they

937
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,240
got a lot of viruses like Epstein bar

938
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,440
hhv6 out aular virus they got all kinds

939
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,119
of stuff HPV they just got lots of

940
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,480
different bugs and so those bugs end up

941
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,079
you know challenging the immune system

942
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,960
over and over again and so when that

943
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,760
happens bacteria that's not great

944
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,720
bacteria that's sitting inside the mouth

945
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,440
can actually produce cavities a little

946
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,280
bit more especially if there's Metals

947
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,920
around and metals in the tissue and some

948
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,800
of these high in metals the immune

949
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,440
system can't keep up with it so cavities

950
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,119
start getting produced even if you're

951
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,560
healing I know people they're healing

952
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,200
look I know people in medical medium

953
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,000
they heal all their cavities they heal

954
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,359
their their mouth they heal they their

955
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,800
teeth regrow enamel so many people

956
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,599
throughout the years their teeth are

957
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,800
regrowing

958
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,560
enamel like they had a hard time with

959
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,079
their teeth because of the deficiencies

960
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,359
and nutritional deficiencies they had

961
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,640
for 20 years and all the medications and

962
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,040
the drugs they've been on and all the

963
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,720
different stuff and the benzos and

964
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,480
everything else everything they tried

965
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,720
you know you name it down the line right

966
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,160
and they're beat up and their teeth all

967
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,319
of a sudden just crumble all the apple

968
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,200
cider vinegar that's another thing okay

969
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:44,000
okay if there's one thing I can give you

970
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,920
one thing you can take away from this

971
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,960
stop the Apple C of vinegar stop all

972
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
vinegars but stop the Apple C of vinegar

973
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,920
if Apple C of vinegar is the only

974
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,560
vinegar you're going to use because

975
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,280
you're going to use the B worst vinegars

976
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,680
then use the Apple Coda vinegar but stop

977
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,359
it if you're worried about your teeth

978
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,920
and your HC and your gastric glands be

979
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,480
careful with the apple cider vinegar

980
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,280
because apple cider vinegar will start

981
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,119
leeching all the Calum will leech out of

982
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,839
your teeth and over time and then years

983
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,760
go by and even if you're doing the right

984
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,040
things finally your teeth crumble even

985
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,480
when you're finally doing the right

986
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,520
things you find like answers and you're

987
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,480
healing you know why you're sick from EP

988
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,880
bar you're getting Metals out your teeth

989
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,040
can still have the delayed effect of of

990
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,520
all the vinegar for 20 years so it takes

991
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,000
time for that to heal too

992
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,200
mirio says I had receding gums and

993
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,240
exposed tooth and celery juice fixed

994
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,319
that for me celery juice does I wrote a

995
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,359
book the celery juice book that talks

996
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,839
about what it does for gums and teeth

997
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:44,200
and how it could even stop errosion and

998
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:45,640
enamel erosion and gum receding yeah I

999
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,000
mean it's critical you have to have the

1000
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,760
celery juice too there's some people

1001
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,960
that need more than the celery juice but

1002
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,640
the ACV does damage and it does damage

1003
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,640
that shows post post damage later on all

1004
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,040
right so let's talk about the golden

1005
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,800
seal

1006
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,240
so we're talking about the propolis this

1007
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,880
is VY stuff right here V is and Victor i

1008
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,599
m is and Mary E RG

1009
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,440
y.com okay themy stuff I endorse these

1010
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,520
guys because they are the greatest the

1011
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
greatest and the greatest you see people

1012
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,119
who like you know like whatever rep

1013
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,440
companies out there and stuff like that

1014
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,880
you see it out there they're not saying

1015
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,319
that you know this is the greatest and

1016
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,960
they don't say all the good reasons and

1017
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,720
all that right but when you know what

1018
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,760
they're doing and how they're doing in

1019
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,839
the process I had to stand behind this

1020
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,960
company do you know how many companies

1021
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,200
come to me out there you

1022
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,720
guys a dozen a day medical medium can

1023
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,079
you get behind my company medical medium

1024
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,680
can you get behind my company medical

1025
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,240
medium if you guys only knew what our

1026
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,839
inboxes looked like you wouldn't believe

1027
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,200
it I could rep a 100 companies out there

1028
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:53,599
make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

1029
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,000
of millions of dollars but I don't the

1030
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,280
point is it has to be like something

1031
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,040
special the best thing in the world

1032
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,000
world the best thing I think is out

1033
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,839
there in the world and that's the

1034
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,240
vimergy

1035
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,240
stuff anyway the golden

1036
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,520
seal the golden seal speaks for itself

1037
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,520
it just does I talk about it in the

1038
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,839
books I talk about in the medical medium

1039
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,960
series the book

1040
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,319
series golden seal right I love it for a

1041
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,920
lot of reasons there's golden seal shock

1042
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,760
therapy you should look into it

1043
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,599
everybody should have a golden seal and

1044
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,400
not a golden seal with alcohol in it

1045
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,680
natural flavors not a golden seal with

1046
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,359
citric acid in it not a golden seal with

1047
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,440
some other crazy stuff that they're not

1048
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,760
listing on the bottle remember I told

1049
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,200
you there's this like there's this

1050
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,520
there's 10% law I something like I don't

1051
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,559
know it's a small

1052
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,960
percentage and all these supplement

1053
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,240
companies can put all the stuff in it

1054
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,000
nobody even knows they don't have to

1055
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,880
list it well vimergy doesn't do that

1056
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,920
anyway golden seal a potent powerful

1057
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,160
golden

1058
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,680
seal you can't go wrong with that so

1059
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,599
it's another thing too and then um

1060
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,200
the good old

1061
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,240
zinc zinc liquid zinc sulfate right

1062
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,839
there the vimergy one the only one I

1063
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,599
trust

1064
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,680
um critical for the immune system and

1065
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,960
we're in January right now heading into

1066
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,280
February and there is a [ __ ]

1067
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,000
storm heading over into the United

1068
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,720
States it's a [ __ ] storm of a lot of RSV

1069
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,160
a [ __ ] storm of a lot of flu bugs

1070
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,480
different flu of all

1071
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,160
kinds different Seas of all of all kinds

1072
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,000
and all that you believe it at this

1073
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,720
point still I say

1074
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,280
C at this point everybody says what they

1075
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,520
want out there right I still have to say

1076
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,400
C because like I said you don't get

1077
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,280
awards for getting people better A lot

1078
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,280
of people better like thousands upon

1079
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,359
thousands you don't get Awards and you

1080
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,240
don't get

1081
00:43:52,359 --> 00:44:00,800
like um you don't get immunity for it so

1082
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,359
yeah see anyway so there's a lot of that

1083
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,240
going around there's a lot of that out

1084
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:06,240
there so keep in mind you want your

1085
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,599
immune system strong and protect it you

1086
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,760
want your immune system in a good place

1087
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,440
what you see in front of me is the zinc

1088
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,960
you got the propolis and check out

1089
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,680
golden seal it should be in your cabinet

1090
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,760

00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:46,440
table

1270
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,480
okay yeah

1271
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,000
exactly and if somebody's out there and

1272
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,160
they want to take it to a whole another

1273
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,839
level of like whatever it is saying that

1274
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,200
harm was created because of this because

1275
00:50:53,839 --> 00:51:00,559
of because of you know like some

1276
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,880
fruit and you could eat meat you can be

1277
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,839
vegan you can do whatever you want and

1278
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
still do medical medium but if you're

1279
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,000
like you think you were harmed by

1280
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,599
actually learning some really good

1281
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,920
information and taking care of yourself

1282
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,839
well then we're going to look at all

1283
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,440
your

1284
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,960
records

1285
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,880
yeah yeah like if you want to take it

1286
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,359
out there and put it out there publicly

1287
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,440
like then we need to see all your

1288
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:24,839
records I want to see all your

1289
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,119

1295
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
yeah

1296
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,839
so

1297
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,160
mhm and we should do that too if someone

1298
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,640
wants to take it to to the full extent

1299
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:52,480
of I've been hurt by actually doing some

1300
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:55,240
wild blueberries and and my teeth fell

1301
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,799
out from doing medical medium really cuz

1302
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,920
everybody's teeth are healing on medic

1303
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,400
medium and if sometimes it's a delay

1304
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,040
Factor people get into medical medium

1305
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,240
they're already their teeth their their

1306
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,799
teeth was having problems but if you're

1307
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,680
going to go there to the full extent and

1308
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:10,119
and go like hogwire public about it or

1309
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,760
something then yeah we have to do

1310
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,520
something like legally we need to look

1311
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,079
at all your documents all your records

1312
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,799
all your stuff we need to see like were

1313
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,440
you in a case study somewhere where they

1314
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:20,920
were only feeding you medical medium

1315
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,119
stuff and they had they were watching

1316
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,280
everything they're watching everything

1317
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:27,280
you did every food you ate every no

1318
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,760
it's an insane

1319
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:34,040
world but you guys know

1320
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,760
that living light right there shared

1321
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,480
medical medium information with

1322
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,359
cooworker as soon as she learned she got

1323
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,920
life-changing foods and started medical

1324
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:46,040
medium healing immediately and her A1C

1325
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,000
has dropped from 6.5 to five that's

1326
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,319
actually really incredible by the way

1327
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,559
and she's lost weight doing morning

1328
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,559
cleanse it's amazing you know know why I

1329
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,160
don't talk about type two type diabetes

1330
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,760
and type one two you know why I don't

1331
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,240
talk about Len and everything else and

1332
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,319
diabetes and stuff like that and and and

1333
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,319
it's in the books I talk about diabetes

1334
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:07,280
and pre-diabetes and pre pre pre pre

1335
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:10,079
pre-diabetes in the books Liver Rescue

1336
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,000
you guys I I I I love talking about the

1337
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,640
reason why I don't talk about it because

1338
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,079
you get fixed when you're doing medical

1339
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,920
medium there's so many different

1340
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,640
difficult neurological symptoms that we

1341
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,280
need that I always try to help people

1342
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,359
with and push them forward with because

1343
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,880
those are oh man those can dog along

1344
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:28,520
because nerves get damaged and you got

1345
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,319
to repair the nerves and they take time

1346
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:35,359
but man type 2 diabetes boom like boom

1347
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,920
off insulin after a while boom yeah

1348
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,599
because you know you lower those fats

1349
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,599
you're getting the insulin resistance

1350
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,200
and your oh my God the diabetes

1351
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,040
information out there by the way the

1352
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,119
glucose stuff out there and the glucose

1353
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,240
people out there are talking about

1354
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,000
glucose and making big like you know

1355
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,680
making big waves out there because they

1356
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,280
got they run a billion ads they got

1357
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,880
money behind them right and they're

1358
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,319
they're not censored they're not Shadow

1359
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,000
banded and they're out there and they're

1360
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:00,280
doing the glucose crap out there all

1361
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,680
those people talking about that the

1362
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,920
influencers and

1363
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,960
stuff I don't know how anybody survives

1364
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,880
what they

1365
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,760
offer all they offer are insul creating

1366
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,440
insulin resistance that's that's all

1367
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,040
they offer out there they offer things

1368
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,720
pretending it's going to help eat this

1369
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,319
with this eat this with that and all it

1370
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,559
does is create insulin resistance I

1371
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,480
don't know how anybody's going to get

1372
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,359
better out there with the amount of the

1373
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,880
amount of crap that's regurgitating and

1374
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:30,240
recycling back into itself it's like a

1375
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,599
giant monster of [ __ ] people send in DMS

1376
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,160

too okay just want to tell you guys

1524
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,039
anyway when it comes down to oral health

1525
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,839
we want to build our immune system we

1526
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,400
want it strong we want the immune system

1527
01:00:54,839 --> 01:01:00,079
in our neck and in our throat and in our

1528
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,960
mouth to be strong so it kills off

1529
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,480
things that enter our mouth so it kills

1530
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,280
off stuff when you go to the

1531
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:11,319
dentist something you know just all

1532
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,480
kinds of different things

1533
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:17,680
and here's what I recommend if you're at

1534
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,240
the dentist office make your dentist and

1535
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,720
the

1536
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,359
hygienist right and the

1537
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,920
assistant make them change over their

1538
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:29,359
gloves if you're at a dentist office

1539
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,119
where they're they're they take your

1540
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,359
they take their gloves off and they

1541
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:36,000
place it

1542
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:38,359
down like on the counter they leave the

1543
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,240
assistants leave because they're on like

1544
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:42,280
this policy of like they don't want to

1545
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,559
waste gloves and then they come back and

1546
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,880
they put the same pair on okay I talk

1547
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:50,440
about this in brain saver brain saver is

1548
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,720
over there but what I'm trying to say is

1549
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,039
you go to the dentist since we're

1550
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,319
talking about oral health make them

1551
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:59,079
change out gloves because the gloves are

1552
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:01,000
to protect the you know protect them

1553
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:04,039
right but you want you want it to

1554
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,680
protect you too I can go into detail

1555
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:07,680
about that we can do a whole show on it

1556
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,599
but the whole glove changing thing is

1557
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,079
really

1558
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:14,240
important so it

1559
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,599
is because they touch everything and

1560
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,079
they're touching all the stuff and all

1561
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,640
