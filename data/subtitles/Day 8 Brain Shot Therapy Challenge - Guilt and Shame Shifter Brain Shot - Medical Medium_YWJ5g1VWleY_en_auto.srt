I told you guys before when I was

136
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,259
sitting on my desk and I was taking the

137
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,259
information from Spirit of compassion

138
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,520
my mind was being blown

139
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,860
every second

140
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,979
and when I was getting the information

141
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,319
for these brain shot therapies I was

142
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,300
promised

143
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,060
because I was writing the information

144
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,280
down and what I was writing down was and

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,220
this is what's incredible about this

146
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,440
what I was writing down

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,479
which was so incredible

148
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
check this out

149
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,539
I was writing down medical medium brain

150
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,880
shot therapy offers instant relief

151
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,259
I wrote that down

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,840
right

153
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,759
because that's what I heard

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,120
and so what I said to Spirit of

155
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,160
compassion was oh wait a minute here

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,240
I know a lot of people get some instant

157
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,740
relief

158
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
pretty quickly when they're doing their

159
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,460
celery juice which has saved a lot of

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,500
lives around the world

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,199
I know people have gotten relief within

162
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,000
days of the heavy metal detox smoothie

163
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,919
I know they've gotten relief on the

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,479
monocleanse I know they've gotten relief

165
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,940
from the medical medium tools and

166
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,880
protocols I know they've gotten relief

167
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,680
from the zinc shock therapy

168
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,440
and the incredible vitamin C shock

169
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,979
therapy instant relief

170
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,960
I know they've gotten relief before but

171
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,000
you're telling me these brain shot

172
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,700
therapies are going to provide instant

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,159
relief but not just instant relief on a

174
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,120
way that was just unbelievable

175
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:43,560
miraculous the ability to even

176
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,240
push away a hundred symptoms over time

177
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,320
so when I heard that from Spirit of

178
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,140
compassion

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,980
I had to stop myself I remember I was in

180
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:56,040
mid flight of writing it down

181
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,080
because I hand write the Books

182
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,279
so as I'm hearing the information I'm

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,620
hand so I'm I'm basically like a scribe

184
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,980
and I'm just

185
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,080
hearing the information right

186
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,580
so it's the whole profit thing you're

187
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,040
hearing the information and you're

188
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,080
writing it down that's what it is and so

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,700
I'm doing that and spirit of compassion

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,260
is telling me instant relief and I'm

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,899
like instant relief

192
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,300

and I was promised

202
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,820

203
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,560

Christmas morning to come

210
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,839

I mean

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,480
can there even be words for him so we're

217
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,240
doing the guilt and shame shifter we're

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,399
day eight gilton's shame shifter

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,339
now a lot of people Harbor guilt and

220
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,779
shame deep down inside

221
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,240
so I want to talk about the brain shot

222
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,040
therapy for a couple of seconds right

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,019
medical medium brain shot therapies

224
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,700
Uncharted Territory now all medical

225
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,980
medium books are they're all been

226
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,220
Uncharted Territory right

227
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,959
but this takes it to another level of

228
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,540
Uncharted

229
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,339
these are special configurations

230
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,339
synergistically combined just right to

231
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:56,600
crack the code

232
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,600
to crack the code

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,880
now you can have a Creative Juice

234
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,839
concoction but that's not what this is

235
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,000
this is medicinals

236
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,140
organized in a way that only above can

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
know

238
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,140
to crack the code on how to rewire

239
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,820
and reset the brain

240
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,920
I mean when you think about that it's

241
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,019
just like oh my God that's why these

242
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,480
books are the best books in history

243
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,839
hands down they're the greatest books of

244
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,839
all time

245
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,060
they are the greatest books of all time

246
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,160
you can be the judge go pick yourself up

247
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,260
some health books out there from the the

248
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,839
best podcast doctors or whoever go pick

249
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,980
up some books read those and then read

250
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,600
these

251
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,399
you'll find those are empty

252
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,019
unfortunately and you'll find that these

253
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,640
have so much information line for line

254
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,220
you've never even heard or read before

255
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,140
and your minds will be blown to such a

256
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,600
degree it is unbelievable and it's like

257
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,519
that with all medical medium books but

258
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,339
the point is is these right here it's

259
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
like I I don't even know what to say

260
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,480
so these are special configurations

261
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,500
synergistically combined just right to

262
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,459
crack the code to reset and to rewire

263
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,339
the brain how powerful is that

264
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,980
these brain shots

265
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,720
are unreal the healing shots of the

266
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,000
medical medium brain shot therapy are

267
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,260
tools that come from above these brain

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,820
shots are composed of special

269
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,399
combinations of ingredients working

270
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,220
together systematically for specific

271
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,600
reasons that only a source above can

272
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,820
know

273
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,160
oh my God

274
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,040
the relationships among these

275
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,920
ingredients right no one would ever know

276
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,320
that guilt and shame can be vanquished

277
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,120
just eliminated between these three

278
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,060
ingredients

279
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,860
Mary Lou says when will you be live on

280
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,519
Facebook

281
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,779
I'm live on Facebook now

282
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,779
but unfortunately

283
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,500
yeah

284
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,100
I mean it's not your fault you can't see

285
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,100
me on Facebook

286
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,399
because you're not allowed to heal

287
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:08,399
people that's why

288
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,320
um on a level that we do with these

289
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,300
books it's just no one's ever seen this

290
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,339
before in history

291
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:20,339
so Brett says this shot these shots are

292
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,920
my favorite immediate uplifting shift

293
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,019
incredible

294
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,480
the relationships among these

295
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,339
ingredients are intricate and unknown to

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,959
anyone so that means when you stick our

297
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,839
this is just today this shot the golden

298
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,600
chain shifter when you stick Orange

299
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,100
and spinach and ginger together just

300
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,880
those three you put something else in

301
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,880
there it doesn't work

302
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,279
you have one of those missing it doesn't

303
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,440
work

304
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,300
think about that

305
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,940
you have ginger missing it doesn't work

306
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,060
you have orange missing it doesn't work

307
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,800
you have spinach missing it doesn't work

308
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,839
you have to have these three and only

309
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,820
these three in the amount it is to in

310
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,880
order for it to actually eliminate the

311
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,160
guilt and shame that's deep within us

312
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,519
to get relief instantly with guilt and

313
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,519
shame

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,579
you eat a big old chocolate cake and

315
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,860
you've got all this guilt about it you

316
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,380
get these three ingredients together

317
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,880
and you juice them in the form in the

318
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,880
way that we're talking about here

319
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,279
you got guilt and shame deep within from

320
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,380
something you think you did wrong in

321
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,480
your life something he did you think

322
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,060
that didn't go right in your life

323
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,399
whatever it is get these three together

324
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,779
if you have a past skeleton shame thing

325
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,100
if you have a present guilt and shame

326
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,440
thing

327
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,260
get these three ingredients together in

328
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,019
the order in the way and the amounts

329
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,579
because no one would know ever anywhere

330
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,279
anyhow

331
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,899
any possibility

332
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,180
that when you put these three together

333
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,240
just right

334
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,339
it gets somewhere into here

335
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,339
it drives into the brain

336
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,639
and you know you know where it goes

337
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm going to open up this brain right

338
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,220
here this cavity

339
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,220
create a cavity here

340
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,040
into the emotional center of the brain

341
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,899
so only a source above would know that

342
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,079
when these three come together that

343
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,060
Miracle happens

344
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,000
where that energy from these three

345
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,920
ingredients gets driven directly

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,740
absorbed into the emotional center of

347
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,139
the brain and unlocks

348
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,320
a condition

349
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,300
in order to heal

350
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:40,459
rewires and resets

351
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,459
that's how incredible this really is

352
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,180
truly unbelievable

353
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,720
says I just watched a retired Air Force

354
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,300
pilot sharing about UFO their team saw

355
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,639
in the air at night isn't it funny how

356
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,100
after the UFO podcast Anthony shared a

357
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,100
lot more people did the same

358
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,399
it's very funny

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,399
so

360
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,180
yeah check out that aliens podcast when

361
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,459
you guys get the chance

362
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,220
Sienna says the obsessive thoughts brain

363
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:19,800
had a huge impact on my teen daughter so

364
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,720
use so you use the obsessive thoughts

365
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,940
shifter the brain shot therapy

366
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,800
incredible

367
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,500
that means everything

368
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,779
if there is an impact from that

369
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,339
obsessive thought shifter

370
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,699
with your daughter

371
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,360

right there

373
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,940
Winslow says loving the shots they are

374
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,940
so powerful

375
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:49,019
these shots are really addictive in a

376
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,880
good way because they give you relief

377
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,519
and they start moving the needle fast

378
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,380
and they start getting what needs to be

379
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
done quick and here's the crazy thing

380
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,500
when you're doing the other medical

381
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,820
medium tools and you're doing the brain

382
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,740
shots

383
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,300
you don't have to do the other medical

384
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,740
medium tools you just do the brain shots

385
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,959
you get relief but the point is when

386
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,860
you're doing the medical medium tools

387
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,720
and if you're even doing my God

388
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,720
the shock Therapies

389
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,939
not just the brain shot therapy the

390
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:24,540
actual medical medium shock Therapies in

391
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:27,179

that alone is just unbelievable there's

393
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,980
nothing out there like that that anybody

394
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,380
could ever touch or see

395
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,520
Gigi says the first one gave me instant

396
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,799

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,679
this is what is needed

400
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,840
is this type of information for what

401
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,280
we're up against today

402
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,280

that one and still they're still coming

409
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,620
up

410
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,419
when you think about it and that's

411
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,260
incredible by the way

412
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,260
really is

413
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,059
Jay Moore says all your information got

414
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,480
rid of my horrendous migraine

415
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,260
where I projectile vomit the pain was so

416
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720
bad

417
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,400
I am free of migraines this past four

418
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,020
years

419
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,700
I mean when you think about that you're

420
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,640
free of the migraines for the past four

421
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,760
years what does that mean

422
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,039
to someone who suffers from a migraine

423
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,140
condition that means

424
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,880
that means freedom

425
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,240
freedom is critical and that's what

426
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,299
these books are they are freedom

427
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,100
the greatest books of all time provide

428
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,679
freedom

429
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,360
and there's so much to be said about

430
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,160
that

431
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
what's incredible you guys and I was

432
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,280
thinking about this this morning I woke

433
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,140
up five o'clock this morning and what I

434
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,660
was thinking about was

435
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,860
if even one podcast doctor or one Health

436
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,780
Guru

437
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,780
had even a fraction of this information

438
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
they would probably withhold it and make

439
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,080
sure they would charge thousands of

440
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,000
dollars for you to access it a fraction

441
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,559
of this information it's really

442
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,299
unbelievable but they don't even have a

443
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,940
fraction of it anyway

444
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,220
unless they poach it later which many do

445
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,679
Susan says I want to do the nerve

446
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,200
shifter shot again today wow

447
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,059
it was my favorite so far it gave me a

448
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,440
sense of clarity and energy that's

449
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,419
incredible

450
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,120
of course you can do that one again

451
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,100
Nicole says I slept super good for the

452
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,900
third night after the shots I was

453
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,280
struggling to even get five hours of

454
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,840
sleep before this now here's how it

455
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,559
works

456
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,419
a lot of the like the adrenal right

457
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,700
the adrenal um

458
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,020
I mean like there's okay first of all I

459
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,539
wish you wanted to say wait another one

460
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,700
too Lake says my teen daughter is being

461
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:06,559
transformed before my very eyes with

these shots I can't believe it

463
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,780
that means everything

464
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,140
Jen says oh boy the shot therapies are

465
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,820
so very powerful loving the results

466
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,320
results matter

467
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,480
they matter when it comes down to

468
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,419
chronic illness

469
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,160

protocols powerful protocols there's

484
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,000
also the medical medium shock therapies

it's critical I'm just letting you know

492
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,580
right there

493
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,559
I talk about you know how I fully

494
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,140
endorsed the vemergy company

495
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,539
fully endorse them because of the four

496
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,039
incredible things that they offer and do

497
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,679
that no supplement companies in my

498
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,240
opinion ever touched upon or do which is

499
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,140
mind-blowing

500
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,840
so check out uh you know my website

501
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,120
medical medium.com supplements directory

502
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,159
so if you're embarking into the

503
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,780
supplement world and you're thinking

504
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,580
about like medical means shock therapies

505
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,919
the problem is

506
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,500
if you use the wrong stuff

507
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,840
it's just their lack of results occur

508
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,179
that's one thing that could happen if

509
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,460
you use the wrong stuff it's also just

510
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,320
other problems too because

511
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,600
there's a lot of junky stuff out there

512
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,059
going to that another day

513
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,159
but the information in this book and the

514
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,900
amount of protocols and the amount of

515
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
conditions and symptoms neurologically

516
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,220
is just through the roof including the

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,720
recipes and the brain shot therapy we're

518
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,880
doing we're day a of the brain shot

519
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,059
therapy cleanse and we're on the entry

520
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,059
level

521
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,720
mystery chronic guilt here we are

522
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,960
in the emotional centers of the brain

523
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:41,120
certain areas of nerve tissue are partly

524
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,120
responsible for the way we feel

525
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,460
it's not only the tissue itself

526
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,159
this is incredible

527
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,020
the brain's emotional centers are

528
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,020
intertwined greatly with our soul

529
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,780
and the science of research doesn't know

530
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,720
that

531
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:05,280
Neuroscience a brain hack

532
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,380
nobody they don't know that literally

533
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,679
that in the emotional centers of the

534
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,679
brain

535
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,760
it's not just the brain tissue but in

536
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,980
the emotional center of the centers of

537
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,400
the brain it's the brain tissue being

538
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,679
intertwined with our soul

539
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
if someone feels guilty for something

540
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,580
they've done

541
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,580
and that's appropriate for the

542
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,880
circumstance the soul is tied into this

543
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,919
emotional response in the brain

544
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,020
that that's mind-blowing information by

545
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,400
the way

546
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,400
when you even think about that

547
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,620
if someone never feels guilty even when

548
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,720
they should when it would help them

549
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,900
learn and grow and give others

550
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,840
resolution right

551
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,659
there's a disconnect

552
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,460
for one there's a disconnect between the

553
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,520
soul and the brain's emotional centers

554
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,260
so if someone does something terrible to

555
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,059
somebody and they don't feel guilty

556
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,740
there's a disconnect between their soul

557
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,740
and the emotional center of the brain

558
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,980
I want to read something really quick

559
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,980
quote

560
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,020
right here in the brain saver book

561
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,640
because it reminds me of what we're

562
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,340
looking at now

563
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,059
we all know there are bad people in the

564
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,880
world

565
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,240
and these people have no interest in

566
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,900
protecting us or our brains

567
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,080
only a great agenda to find ways to hurt

568
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,380
us and our brains

569
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,840
we deserve to be wise to this so we can

570
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,020
look out for ourselves and the ones we

571
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,020
love

572
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,980
bad people in the world and they don't

573
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,059
feel guilty for what they do and what

574
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,640
they've done

575
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,900
because there's a disconnect between

576
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,940
their soul

577
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,940
and the emotional centers of the brain

578
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,080
if if someone never feels guilty when

579
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,179
they should

580
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,179
when it would help them learn and grow

581
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,679
and give others resolution

582
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,539
if you feel guilty about something bad

583
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,539
that happened it gives others resolution

584
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,760
there's a disconnect if they don't have

585
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,260
that for one there's a disconnect

586
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,659
between the soul and the brain's

587
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,220
emotional centers the soul has pushed

588
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,220
away from the brain

589
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,299
you don't have to be a terrible person

590
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,580
doing bad things though for that to

591
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,440
happen so that's important to know there

592
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,159
are bad people in the world where

593
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,620
they'll never be resolution for anyone

594
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,000
but you can also be so injured where you

595
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,000
don't feel guilty about something

596
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,440
because you're so injured and your soul

597
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,179
is pushed away from the brain for

598
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,860
another there's usually been some sort

599
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,120
of toxic exposure in the emotional

600
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,740
centers of the brain causing a

601
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,900
disconnect and electrical signal so that

602
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,520
can happen we can get sick we can

603
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,140
actually have toxic heavy metals inside

604
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,179
the brain we can have some kind of

605
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,679
poison or toxin that's actually

606
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,159
interfering with the Soul's connection

607
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,200
to the emotional center of the brain

608
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,120
when toxic heavy metals such as mercury

609
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,159
and aluminum take up residence there it

610
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,500
can interfere with the empathy sympathy

611
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:30,440
compassion and guilt that are supposed

612
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,440
to arise upon causing harm to others

613
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,700
it can mean that someone never

614
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,620
apologizes for what they've done

615
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,539
Cody says I've been praying for

616
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,640
something like this

617
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,320
I've tried techniques for rewiring the

618
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,360
brain my brain

619
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,679
but I'd get so mad at myself for not

620
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,960
changing

621
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,820
but I'm seeing changes already from

622
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,200
these shots it's amazing and Cody you're

623
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,760
also going to see changes when you read

624
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,500
the information in these books because I

625
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,539
talk about that

626
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,419
I talk about that the brain hacks out

627
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:02,820
there for rewiring they don't make us

628
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,260
feel good about ourselves because the

629
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,659
brain hacks and the people that create

630
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,580
them don't know how our body and brain

631
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,760
even works so all these mistakes are

632
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,760
made

633
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,100
incredible Adam says the nerve shifter

634
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,220
made the pain from my neck and shoulder

635
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:26,340
injuries so much better God bless

636
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,260
that's amazing and you can continue

637
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,299
if your doctor's happy that you're over

638
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,220
there on YouTube amazing ask your doctor

639
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,020
what's right for you guys if if any of

640
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,700
you are concerned too you could always

641
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,900
be like I'll take these brain saver

642
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,900
books to the doctor's office

643
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,100
that's because heavy metals can derail

644
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,840
electrical impulses heavy metals have a

645
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,500
lot to do

646
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:56,179
with our ability not to actually have a

647
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,179
connection to get that disconnect

648
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,919
the soul connects to nerve tissue inside

649
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,700
the brain it's part of the brain that

650
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,760
allows someone to have a heart so

651
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,480
metals can interfere with our soul and

652
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,480
our brain's connection

653
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,140
what about when someone's guilt is

654
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,340
overactive I want to talk about this

655
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,960
next part you guys it's really

656
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,179
interesting

657
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,460
since drinking these shots Atlanta says

658
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,340
since drinking these shots I've been so

659
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,260
relaxed I never remember ever being so

660
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,940
relaxed and I'm sleeping so deeply I

661
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,320
want you guys to know sleep can get a

662
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,000
lot better when you're doing these brain

663
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,799
shot Therapies

664
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,419
because that's how much healing is

665
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,919
happening inside the brain because it's

666
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,980
actually going directly to the brain

667
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,020
fast getting there resetting rewiring

668
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,919
and so healing is going to happen on all

669
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,919
kinds of different levels

670
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:55,440
I mean I waited all year or more

671
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,659
so you guys can have this information

672
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,700
countless hours to make sure these books

673
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,799
got into your hands I can't even I don't

674
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,980
even know what to say it was worth the

675
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:09,620
sacrifice every last bit of it so that

676
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,620
you guys had answers and tools

677
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,400
what about when someone's guilt is

678
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,080
overactive when toxic heavy metals

679
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,640
saturate a different area of the brain's

680
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,320
emotional centers they can cause

681
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,659
electrical impulses to Surge into

682
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,120
adjacent tissue and if that's the area

683
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,799
that governs guilt it heightens guilty

684
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,600
feelings so what happens you guys when

685
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,279
we have toxins inside the brain like

686
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,500
toxic heavy metals and it's in the

687
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,419
emotional centers of the brain it can

688
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,980
make somebody overactive with a lot of

689
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,960
guilt

690
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,700
so what I love about the guilt and shame

691
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,860
shifter it's hitting directly to the

692
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,779
emotional center of the brain

693
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,340
basically what I'm trying to tell you

694
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:46,440
and I'm giving you this really Advanced

695
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,440
information over here

696
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
is that for whatever reason why and how

697
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,700
we're experiencing guilt and shame

698
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,380
whether it's something that happened

699
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,840
that's justifiable

700
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,760
and how we feel or we don't know why

701
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,559
we're feeling this or it's something

702
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,600
that happened 10 years ago in our life

703
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,000
15 years ago in her life 20 years ago

704
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,740
five years whatever it is and we feel

705
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,779
this and it creeps up and we have this

706
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,179
guilt about something or we have this

707
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,820
feeling of Shame about something the

708
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:17,039
guilt and shame shifter can help rewire

709
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,940
and shift and change that that's how

710
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,940
incredible this is

711
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:30,000
Annette says I am still so surprised I

712
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,760
have been trying various shots since a

713
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,740
few days and today I tried the OCD shot

714
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,419
I got a smile on my face because I know

715
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,279
you're gonna it's gonna surprise a lot

716
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,020
of people because they're just they're

717
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,080
gonna get the results and it was the

718
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,179
first time that I could eat my supper

719
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,039
whoa including some cooked peas and

720
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,919
sweet potatoes sounds yummy actually

721
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,980
without feeling that I want to overeat

722
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,140
and without guilt that it was not all

723
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,720
raw that's amazing I usually only

724
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,059
include cooked on the weekends and my

725
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,640
digestion is better than ever I'm still

726
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,679
in awe and so so thankful that's

727
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,679
incredible

728
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,500
that's incredible

729
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,020
marjorie's uh Marjorie says overly

730
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,840
emotional does this mean what does this

731
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,480
mean the books go into great depth about

732
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,760
that there's an emotional brain chapter

733
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,200
that goes into depth I'm not even in the

734
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,919
emotional brain chapter I mean that's

735
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,779
how much information is is actually

736
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,360
placed around the books

737
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:32,640
Jenny Jenn says I'm having a medical

738
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,520
procedure next week for a car accident

739
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,200
and I'm so comforted to know that the

740
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,840
information in these books will be there

741
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,020
for me to cleanse after the medical

742
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,659
procedure that's so incredible I'm so

743
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,460
happy these books are there for you

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,760
incredible one and it helps me tell

people who talk about their ailments to

749
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,059
get your info amazing before I would get

750
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,740
awkward and then bad I didn't do more or

751
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,820
feel bad that you didn't do more and not

752
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,200
anymore

753

755

Josh

756
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,620
the wisdom shot drastically enhanced my

757
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,740
Consciousness and intuition I love the

758
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:22,520
wisdom shot I use that one periodically

759
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,520
as well

760
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,380
I need all the wisdom I can get I

761
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,960
receive the information I put the

762
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,880
information in the books

763
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,480
that's what I do but I always told you

764
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,399
guys I'm not a smart guy I'm just a very

765
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,399
good listener it's one of the abilities

766
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,640
I have and I also have another ability

767
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,320
to hear the voice since age four

768
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,320
and hang in there

769
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,240
for the ride because it's been brutal I

770
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,340
have that other ability

771
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,500
a certain level of

772
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,320
I guess

773
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,720
certain level of strength I don't know

774
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,120
what someone would call it

775
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,159
So reading through the comments

776
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,720
also going through here

777
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,720
okay so this is interesting

778
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,840
the littlest thing someone does like

779
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,220
borrowing a penny from the penny dish

780
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,659
did you ever do that borrow Penny from

781
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,880
the penny dish and

782
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,320
in the store the grocery store there's a

783
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,659
little pile of pennies there and you go

784
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,000
and grab one you're like here you go

785
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,860
grab two pennies here you go

786
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,899
the littlest thing someone does like

787
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,240
borrowing a penny from the penny dish at

788
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,519
a convenience store can fill them with

789
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,640
regret I've seen that happen the

790
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,679
emotional center of the brain

791
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,360
you know needs to be rewired because

792
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,640
they have that much regret because they

793
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,620
actually I've seen that actually

794
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,059
for someone feels guilty and they took

795
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,100
three pennies out of the penny jar and

796
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,899
they put three pennies down getting so

797
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,240
busy one day that they aren't able to

798
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,980
call back a friend even if that friend

799
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,539
would completely understand can make

800
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,640
someone feel terribly guilty like you

801
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,320
got so busy you can't call back that

802
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,940
friend or call back that family member

803
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,380
and you just feel the guilt it's just

804
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,720
hanging over you

805
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,339
to the point where it hurts

806
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,960
and they're saddened and depressed like

807
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,520
they get depressed over it like the day

808
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,020
ended and you couldn't get back to

809
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,879
someone

810
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:18,300
then when something happens where guilt

811
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,220
is is the appropriate response if that

812
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,839
person makes a particular mistake their

813
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,460
attempts to learn from it can be

814
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,260
heightened to the point of obsession or

815
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,159
danger where you make a mistake and you

816
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,080
hate yourself you hate your guts over it

817
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,820
which is really horrible

818
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,679
that someone feels that way where you

819
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,780
make a mistake and you hate your own

820
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,060
guts like you hate yourself over it

821
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,300
that's brutal so many people go through

822
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,300
that

823
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,200
that's really hard

824
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,619
even approaching harming themselves in

825
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,359
some cases where you want to harm

826
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,460
yourself because you feel so guilty

827
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,200
about some things that's when the guilt

828
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,300
and shame shifter have to come in we

829
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,280
need that relief fast because there's

830
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,920
people out there and I feel so bad for

831
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,960
them for some of the for some simple

832
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,180
things too they'll hate themselves so

833
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,619
much they'll have so much guilt

834
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,880
or if something happened in their life

835
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,200
they'll have so much guilt where they

836
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
want to harm themselves because they

837
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,839
hate themselves that much it's so

838
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,160
terrible

839
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,380
we have to not let that happen to people

840
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,500

KP tree says yesterday shot changed my

858
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,500
day turned it into it turned it all

859
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,280
around I was so happy afterwards

860
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,280
incredible

861
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,680
if that person's soul is injured from

862
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,520
abuse so say there's somebody that

863
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,800
they're injured from abuse right

864
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,660
hardships betrayal or trust breakage so

865
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,300
they're they're injured from trust

866
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,640
breakage hardships they're injured from

867
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,740
abuse of some kind

868
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,420
it can compound the situation and make

869
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,420
the guilt reaction worse

870
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,780
or the reaction can go the opposite

871
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,579
direction where the anger numbness

872
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,320
settle in and displace all feelings that

873
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,760
go completely until the numbness and

874
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,260
anger wear off and then the guilt

875
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,780
returns and that person just hates

876
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,579
themselves and that's sad we don't want

877
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,520
that we don't want people experiencing

878
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,020
that the guilt and shame shifter is one

879
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,119
of the medical medium tools now

880
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,099
available to actually help somebody

881
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,220
shift out of this because you can go

882
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,920
down a rabbit hole of guilt a rabbit

883
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,400
hole of Shame

884
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,980
it's terrifying when you think about it

885
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,220
and to actually be able to fix that for

886
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,780
someone to turn that around is is short

887
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,780

well tell her tell everybody I said hi

940
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,020
please

941
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,760
dear friend of mine

942
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,380
I'm so glad you're here so we're in the

943
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,940
shifter shots

944
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,320
that's where we are let's read about it

945
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,480
a little bit

946
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,000
the world is getting so complicated in

947
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,920
so many ways and we've been pushed in so

948
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,160
many different directions it's easy to

949
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,619
get confused or stuck in a pattern

950
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,780
that is not helpful for the healing

951
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:02,579
process so when we get the guilt and

952
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,440
shame and it takes over and it becomes

953
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:08,040
like a

954
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,119
like Madness really because it's such a

955
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,980
Feeling

956
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,140
I had one person describe it to me years

957
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,780
ago where it felt like just someone was

958
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,180
just taking over them

959
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,160
the guilt and shame could not just leave

960
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,560
it just could they could not get it away

961
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,480
from them or out of them

962
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,119
these brain shots are designed to help

963
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,820
shift our Direction fast

964
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,560
so our body can shift and heal and our

965
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,300
emotional frame of mind can break a

966
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,180
pattern

967
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,339
or confinement that the complications of

968
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,920
this world has created so if we're like

969
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:42,720
confined and stuck in this pattern and

970
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,460
not able to break it we need that

971
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,900
shifter and that's what these are

972
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,940
shifter shots

973
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,859
there's ten shifter shots we're doing

974
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:54,000
the guilt and shame shifter today I'm

975
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:56,099
excited because I have a lot of guilt

976
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,839

998
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,640
a week of shots after being bedridden

999
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,440
for four years oh my God

1000
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,200
you guys by the way

1001
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,640
the comments are this small on the

1002
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,320
screen

1003
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,700
but that's incredible

1004
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,700
that's absolutely incredible

1005
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,880
seriously I mean that that is just

1006
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,859
amazing

1007
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,740
I'm just so proud of you guys but just

1008
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:39,960
know that I'm proud of you George says I

1009
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:44,280
love this book I learned so much and I'm

1010
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:48,240
only page 92. there's two books so you

1011
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,920
got 1200 plus Pages coming your way so

1012
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,200
let me just think here you're page 92

1013
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:58,200
you got 1100 Pages coming your way

1014
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,280
incredible when I think about it

1015
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,599
now ready there's six books per book you

1016
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,180
got to think about it that way because

1017
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,960
that's what it is like one book two

1018
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,880
books three books four books five books

1019
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,180
six books

1020
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,440
there's six books in each book

1021
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,920
yes

1022
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,000
there were many times when I was working

1023
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,319
22 hour days 20 I did a 24-hour day

1024
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,599
which was stupid of me but which was

1025
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,920
definitely reckless in my opinion but I

1026
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,119
knew the deadlines were coming and I

1027
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,560
knew I had to make sure I get this

1028
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,460
information out there

1029
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,619
media mediate says our medial says I

1030
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,640
feel so calm after the energy shifter

1031
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,400
shots

1032
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,900
think they changed my personality what

1033
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,859
they're doing is let's talk about that a

1034
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,960
little bit

1035
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:50,040
like if you're doing the energy shifter

1036
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,740
shot

1037
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,119
or the obsessive thoughts shifter shot

1038
00:43:52,740 --> 00:44:00,060
or your guilt and shame shifter shot or

1039
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,920
a stabilizer or any of them what's

1040
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,200
happening is they're going into the

1041
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,180
emotional centers of the brain but only

1042
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,160
a source from above would know the

1043
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,040
combination in order to make that happen

1044
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,099
it cannot happen if you just do some

1045
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,960
juicing it will not happen now straight

1046
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,900
celery juice is an incredible Miracle

1047
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,520
tool it is for doing all the things I've

1048
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,520
talked about in the books

1049
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,020
but the brain shots or are another tool

1050
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,300
from above

1051
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,300
so what we're essentially doing is we're

1052
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,220
bringing in more tools that are just so

1053
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,960
profound and when you even put some of

1054
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,660
these together these tools just forget

1055
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,220
it you're moving forward you get out of

1056
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,720
bed you get out of wheelchairs you get

1057
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,380
you get moving through your you know you

1058
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:46,140
get moving you heal you you grow you

1059
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,460
move forward it's just miraculous and

1060
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,800
amazing

1061
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,760
but what happens is

1062
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,040
this is absorbing really quick instantly

1063
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,380
instantly going to the brain boom but

1064
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,660
it's not just the absorption factor that

1065
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,400
happens it's knowing that if you put

1066
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,560
these three together there's a quick

1067
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,060
absorption rate but it's not just that

1068
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,400
there's something in these three

1069
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,619
ingredients that actually does something

1070
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,880
to certain groups of neurons that no one

1071
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,800
would ever know and science can never

1072
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,140
figure out

1073
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,119
so too says

1074
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:25,079
Anthony a new study about EBV causing me

1075
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,359
long covet in Sweden really because they

1076
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,880
got it from medical medium

1077
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,400
and it was published first

1078
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,180
medical media where are you where's

1079
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,180
medical medium

1080
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:38,280
so

1081
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,020
what happens is when they say that

1082
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,180
there's a new study what they're not

1083
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,260
telling you situ is what they're not

1084
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,440
telling you

1085
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,240
is that they took it from a New York

1086
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,400
Times best-selling book in a number one

1087
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,099
New York Times best-selling author and

1088
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,500
they're not giving me credit because the

1089
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:58,200
information is too mind-blowing and too

1090
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,579
incredible already published first and

1091
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,000
so what they're doing is they're

1092
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:04,579
illegally

1093
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,920
plagiarizing or taking that information

1094
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:09,480
trying to get the gold star put on them

1095
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,640
whatever

1096
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,200
about their Discovery and they're not

1097
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,660
saying that it was already published

1098
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,579
first discovered already done

1099
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,140
and put out there

1100
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:25,280
so

1101
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:25,280
do you call that evil oh yeah

1102
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,280
Selena says I'm I'm in such a good mood

1103
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,040
since doing the brain shots thank you so

1104
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:38,040
much aw and SOC the info in the books

1105
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,380
blows my mind I studied psychology and

1106
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,619
medical medium info is way ahead

1107
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,960
Neuroscience like a lot and incredible

1108
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,000
thank you Selena thank you for being

1109
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,280
here and thank you for for that comment

1110
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,839
it means a lot and you know what happens

1111
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,460
is the medical medium information is

1112
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,020
really Advanced so when you see in

1113
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,160
mystery chronic illness out there when

1114
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,599
they're trying to do a study on

1115
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,339
something or something it's already been

1116
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,200
done and figured out by medical medium

1117
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,900
published already before or spoke about

1118
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,859
in lectures or podcasts I already put it

1119
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,260
out there

1120
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,940
so and this includes Mayo Clinic this

1121
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,819
includes other clinics this includes

1122
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,440

1190
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,619
ounces or some food or a whole bunch of

1191
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,540
stuff right after you send your shot

1192
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,590

1193
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,119

1306
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:18,180
couple of different ones too you can

1307
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,260
they're just so powerful you can switch

1308
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,260
it up

1309
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,540
here's one right here

1310
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:28,380
you're feeling guilt or Shame about

1311
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:31,680
something you said and can't unsay

1312
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,780
now I say all kinds of things

1313
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,460
remember when we were doing a live like

1314
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,440
way back do you guys remember when we

1315
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,819
were doing a live way back and that

1316
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,640
person was saying all those terrible

1317
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:43,380
things about me like Terrible Things

1318
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,700
they were like trolling and they were

1319
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,520
saying all these terrible things and

1320
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:50,819
then Dr Nesbitt

1321
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:54,920
came out and called the person psycho

1322
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:54,920
I felt really bad for Dr Nesbitt

1323
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,180
Jackie B says you should say mayonnaise

1324
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,800
Clinic I always used to say Manos

1325
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,680
mayonnaise Clinic

1326
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,359
they make a lot of mayo there what else

1327
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,760
are they doing they don't have the

1328
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:10,980
answers for chronic illness

1329
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,420
I mean no disrespect I'm sure there's

1330
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,400
some good docs there

1331
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,339
but either way I think they're making a

1332
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,780
lot of mayonnaise there is what I think

1333
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,819
Selena

1334
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,680
just my opinion I have every right to

1335
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:26,339
have an opinion everybody else has an

1336
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,740
opinion against me 24 7 about me

1337
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:30,839
can't have an opinion one time

1338
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:33,359
Selena

1339
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:35,339
psychology is now acknowledging that

1340
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,920
toxic heavy metals are in part behind

1341
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:41,000
autism oh my God

1342
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,000
oh my God

1343
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,839
let's see what the rest of your comment

1344
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,540
is

1345
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:53,280
Selena says psychology is now

1346
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,900
acknowledging that toxic heavy metals

1347
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,760
are in part behind autism did you know

1348
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,220
there's no science study that shows

1349
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,619
toxic heavy metals are behind autism

1350
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,280
did you know there's no study or proof

1351
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:07,920
or any kind of like discovery

1352
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,140
it was published almost a decade ago in

1353
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,819
the medical medium book here and also

1354
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,160
lectured by me many years before but you

1355
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:16,380
say something else but they won't say

1356
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,300
what to do to heal because they don't

1357
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,559
know and they never knew it was Metals

1358
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,960
anyway they're stealing your information

1359
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,819
and mixing it with BS ridiculous exactly

1360
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,559
that's what they do Selena that's what

1361
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:27,660
they do it's because millions of these

1362
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,559
went around the world with the answer in

1363
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,000
them

1364
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,520
millions of this New York Times

1365
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,339
bestseller went around the world

1366
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,300
and they had to take the information and

1367
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:38,300
they won't sign it back

1368
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,680
I hope when they leave this place

1369
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:47,819
someday I hope

1370
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:51,020
they can find peace with themselves

1371
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:51,020
when they're leaving here

1372
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,480
because they really need to because

1373
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,240
that's just some wrong going down

1374
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,920

being able to Live Your Dream yet

1384
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:28,140
I was feeling that a long time ago and

1385
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,900
still do

1386
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,780
because I was forced into this by Spirit

1387
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:37,319
of compassion at age four I still want

1388
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:40,980
to do something on my own someday

1389
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:42,960

yes includes lemon water in the morning

1393
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,440

00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,420
will get answers and heal that is my

1395
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,520
dream but when I was younger and spirit

1396
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,619
of compassion was

1397
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,099
making me do this

1398
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:07,319
my dream was to just ride my bicycle and

1399
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:09,059
do a lot of other fun things when I was

1400
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,800

1410
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,180
so you can't you can't forgive someone

who has hurt you it's a hard one to do

1412
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,380

00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,420
understand and release emotional wounds

1418
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,359
that are

1419
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,420
actually igniting guilt and shame

1420
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:01,339
perpetuating

1421
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:01,339
all right let's work on it now

1422
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,940
I'm excited you guys I'm going to move

1423
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,359
over the brain a little bit here let's

1424
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,359
get going

1425
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,579
it's the mm-1500

1426
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,700
I mean I got a little guilt that I

1427
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,020
haven't been talking about it

1428
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,520
for a while

1429
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,140
because I've been so busy trying to get

1430
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,000
the book done and everything else and

1431
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,640
then the juicer sharks came into the

1432
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,859
community started selling people the MLM

1433
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,000
crap and saying that this is the best

1434
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:32,640
juice or whatever and they didn't

1435
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,500
realize it but the mm 1500 and the 900

1436
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,540
is what squeezes more juice out of

1437
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,059
everything and it saves you money

1438
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:42,000
because the cost of produce is going up

1439
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:44,040
and we want something to pay for itself

1440
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,540
so what I find that my personal

1441
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,980
experience and what I've seen other

1442
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,319
people's experiences

1443
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:52,619
the savings that happens when you're

1444
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:55,020
juicing with the mm 1500 or 900 is you

1445
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:58,319
actually pay for the juicer itself

1446
00:59:55,020 --> 01:00:00,720
so that if you ever get a broken part

1447
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,000
it pays for the broken part over again

1448
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,559
unlike the other juicers when you get a

1449
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,480
broken part

1450
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,520
it's not paying for that broken part

1451
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,160
because all the juicers just break all

1452
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:13,500
the time all the juicers out there so if

1453
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,480
you ever get like a worn out part and

1454
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,339
you have to get it pays for itself you

1455
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,140
want something that pays for itself all

1456
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:21,500
the time so you're saving money over and

1457
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,500
over again

1458
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,859

compression saves people money

1474
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,240
the the cool thing which the juicer

1475
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,380
sharks don't know by the way when

1476
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,059
they're trying to rip people off with

1477
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,220
the juicers out there

1478
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:08,220
they don't realize this makes hummus

1479
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,680
salsa sorbet ice cream

did I say hummus again

1482
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,680
flawlessly it's incredible on top of the

1483
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,079

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,859
best juicers and I haven't been

1489
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,839
responding and I feel guilty so I have

1490
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:32,160
guilt and shame about not responding

1491
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:34,319

how to clean your books right take a

dish towel little towel right here

1682
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:09,540
because they come the covers get dirty

1683
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,100
when they go through the Amazon channels

1684
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:13,560
so when they go through the Amazon

1685
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,000
channels you'll get a little smudge on

1686
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,739
them because the conveyor belt's got

1687
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,500
grease on them so you got to clean them

1688
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:22,980
off they come out real nice right with a

1689
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:25,260
little damp cloth a little soap on it

matters to me and that's what it's all

1722
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,440
about now the books cost money to print

1723
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,600
to actually process the print to put

1724
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,640
together to get out there to get in

1725
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,980
trucks the fuel that's burned get to the

1726
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,860
bookstores to get around the world just

1727
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:52,860
know that the 26 dollars and the 29 for

1728
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:55,380
each book 40 off is going to good use at

1729
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:58,020
least to cover some of that cost

1730
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,179
last but not least look out for the

1731
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,980
imposters that say their medical medium

1732
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:03,719
and they say they're Anthony William the

1733
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,580
medical medium and they have my profile

1734
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:08,699
pic and they say they do consultations I

1735
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:10,679
don't do consultations look out for them

1736
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:12,840
because they're out there trying to scam

1737
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,520
everybody along with all the sharks

1738
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,460
trying to scam everybody with their

1739
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,860
their garbage supplements and juicers

1740
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,300
and everything else Under the Sun make

1741
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,739
sure

1742
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,300
um when you're looking when you see an

1743
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,940
imposter I mean if you see the blue

1744
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:29,460
check then it could be medical medium

1745
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,679
here because we got the blue check

1746
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,780
imposters don't have the blue check but

1747
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:38,360
still look out for the imposters they

1748
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:41,219
are shady as heck out there anyway guys
