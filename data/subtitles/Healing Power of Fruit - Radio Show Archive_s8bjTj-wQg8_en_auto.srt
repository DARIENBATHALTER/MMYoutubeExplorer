bottom of all this stuff let's talk

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,120
about today a little bit Today's Show is

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,560
about the healing powers of fruits ooh I

157
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,759
said a swear word right there there hey

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,840
I said a swear word was it bleeped out

159
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,599
you guys I said fruit was fruit bleeped

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,360
out because if this was anywhere else if

161
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,039
this was anywhere else on some kind of

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,759
alternative medicine Forum or even

163
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,960
conventional medicine Forum now it's

164
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,319
even getting to that point um fruit's a

165
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,880
a bad word that's a swear word that's a

166
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,520
naughty word so did you hear the bleep

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,840
okay listen the point is is that we're

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,360
talking about fruit today and the heing

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,560
powers of it because fruit is literally

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,720
crucified and that's what's going on

171
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,479
right now and it has to change it has to

172
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,599
change because fruit is healing it has

173
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,840
power it holds the magic it holds

174
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,400
medicine what I'm trying to tell you is

175
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,599
you just have to eat some fruit because

176
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,400
no one's eating fruit and we're going to

177
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
talk about the power of fruit and what

178
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
it's doing so I don't care what what

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,280
belief system you adopt it you know what

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,320
apples it's 50 apples I'm going to say

363
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,320
it again I can't help it it's like I

364
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,160
can't open right okay listen hang in

365
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,320
there listen let's let's get the seat

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,279
bels on cuz this is going to be this is

367
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,639
going to be a ride this is going to be a

368
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:40,880
real ride listen um 50 apples okay how

369
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,639
many days of the year is there what this

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,079
365 or something right 365 days a year

371
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,279
okay all right 50 apples and that's the

372
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,680
most it gets in the average

373
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:57,240
American so 80 lbs of fruit at best a

374
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,040
year think about that right now and

375
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,560
guess how much sugar that is is

376
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,000
virtually nothing because apples are

377
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,440
water pulp fiber pectin minerals

378
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,759
vitamins

379
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
nutrients and course of course I said

380
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,519
fiber I'll say it again fiber again

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
because different forms of fiber in the

382
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,079
apple and when it's all said and done

383
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,639
including the seeds and the core in the

384
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,759
center and the seeds when it's all said

385
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,720
and done there's very little sugar in an

386
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:34,000
apple very very little sugar and an

387
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,360
apple that we have to understand see

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,480
what's happening is we're on a trend

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,199
right now to take down fruit I'm telling

390
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,240

391
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,360
there's a trend to destroy fruit okay

392
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,440
and to take it down it's literally

393
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,360
novelty as it's sitting in the store now

394
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,360
not a lot of people are buying it they

395
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,480
throw it out by the hordes in all the

396
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,319
health food stores and conventional

397
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,519

not throwing it out that's a whole

401
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,240
another game that's that's swept in the

402
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,480

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,480
got the information I'm getting that

423
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,360
information from students I'm getting

424
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
that information from students just so

425
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,839
you know that that University professors

426
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,360
are teaching students not to eat fruit

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,919
anymore I just want you to know that

428
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,720
right now and and then and and I know i'

429
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,120
I've told you this before recently I

430
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,880
told you this before but in in one one

431
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,120
of the biggest alternative um um

432
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,120
conferences medicine alternative uh

433
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,720
medicine conferences they start off

434
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
throwing a banana against the wall

435
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,720
they've done that I don't know if they

436
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
do at every conference I I have to be

437
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,760
honest about that too I don't know if

438
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,760
it's everyone but I know it was a bunch

439
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,480
of them and and that was a big thing

440
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,520
going on and that was happening on and

441
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,840
off in just the last six seven years

442
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,440
that was part of where this whole thing

443
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,360
start at the downslide on the fruit so

444
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,799
is this information important at all I

445
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,400
mean yeah it's really important there

446
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,919
big reasons for this because without

447
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,159
fruit we're going to be in big trouble

448
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,559
really big trouble without fruit we're

449
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,600
going to go back into the the vitamin C

450
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,720
deficiencies the Deep vitamin C

451
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,440
deficiencies the Deep ones the Deep ones

452
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,520
that cause all that kind of stuff that

453
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,200
used to happen when we l we we had a

454
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,919
lifespan that was like age

455
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:22,280
40 um lifespan of age 45 cuz we died of

456
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:26,200
scurvy and and and squalor and and and

457
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,720
and rickets and infections and you know

458
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,640
disease and leprosy because there 's no

459
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,880
vitamin

460
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,720
C and so you know and it gets us in

461
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
trouble cuz vitamin C runs everything it

462
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
runs your

463
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,799
adrenals it cleanses the body it

464
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
detoxifies you it it detoxifies you

465
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,360
there's people out there that can't

466
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,440
detox because they have no vitamin C

467
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,159
Reserves at all there's no Reserve

468
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
there's no vitamin C Reserve you guys

469
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,080
where does vitamin C come from it comes

470
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
from fruit whether anybody likes it or

471
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,320
not out there I don't care I don't care

472
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,919
who it is who they they are if they

473
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,919
don't understand that those deep

474
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,280
reserves of vitamin C are critical For

475
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,280
Your vitality for your thriving for you

476
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
being able to handle the quickening

477
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,320
coming up which means things are

478
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,600
happening faster faster and faster

479
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,960
people are getting sicker faster than

480
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,039
ever before in history so all of this

481
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,760
going on it's the vitamin C reserves

482
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,080
that stops cancers prevents cancers

483
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,760
halts cancers you know protects us on

484
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,320
all kinds of levels with chronic illness

485
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,200
it's the Deep levels of vitamin C and

486
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,080
there's one other thing and that's this

487
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,159
is related to vitamin C and it's

488
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,320
antioxidants antioxidants stop you from

489
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,679
dying we oxidize that's what aging is

490
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,919
oxidizing you know I hear even in

491
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,840
longevity in the longevity world out

492
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,240
there they're like anti fruit in the

493
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,039
longevity world they're anti fruit in

494
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,000
the longevity World seriously you guys

495
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,919
got to know this not not the entire

496
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,520
longevity world that's out there you

497
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,440
know in The Healing Arts not the not the

498
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
entire group of them I know a longevity

499
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,480
guy that's like no I'm totally into

500
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,080
Fruit I'm believe me I get it I get it

501
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,159
Anthony I get the antioxidants you don't

502
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,880
have to tell me I got it and so not

503
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,720
everybody in longevity but but the

504
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:25,159
majority and the stars of longevity are

505
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,200
anti fruit that means anti- longevity

506
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,480
did you know that that means

507
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,600
anti-longevity

508
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm serious about that I'm not fooling

509
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,720
around I mean that because guess what

510
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
guess where the antioxidants come from

511
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,679
the antioxidants come from fruit and

512
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,960
we're only eating a little bit of it now

513
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,200
we're being told to stop it yeah I'm

514
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,679
pretty passionate about this one there's

515
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,880
a reason this is going to hurt us this

516
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,799
is going to hurt us this is going to

517
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,720
knock the fertility rates right down INF

518
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,240
fertility is going to be just just you

519
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,159
know thriving

520
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,440
infertility and this is going to hurt us

521
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,360
in all kinds of different levels you

522
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,000
know our children's brains are not going

523
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
to be able to develop the way they need

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,799
to because they need certain pieces

525
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,919
certain you know pieces of the puzzle

526
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,919
that are in fruits we're going to talk

527
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,080
about all these things that are going to

528
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,320
go wrong because of this and like I said

529
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,039
the longevity fronts anti fruit they

530
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,360
really are because someone someone

531
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,159
messed up and no one wants to admit a

532
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,760
mess up because you know why we got all

533
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,799
kinds of what is it the ego thing or

534
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,400
whatever that is that's out there you

535
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,600
know someone said to me the other day

536
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,480
they said well sounds like you got an

537
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,279
ego I go I don't know if I do or don't

538
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
all I know is I care about people in

539
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,360
their health and their life and I care

540
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
about their well-being and I care if

541
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,080

through and I know you guys have too

552
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,520
someone was telling me that when you

553
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,360
know when they're around people that are

554
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,240
suffering they they can they can really

555
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,360
feel it in a way that it gets it brings

556
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,240
them to tears when they're around people

557
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,240
that are suffering with symptoms or

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,520
around a loved one that has symptoms and

559
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,159
they're struggling and it brings them to

560
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,840
tears they feel it you know they feel

561
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,600
that that feeling inside I know what

562
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,559
that is I I understand understand it and

563
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,960
it's about it's about look reclaiming

564
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,720
our health moving forward rising out of

565
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,679
the ashes and and getting healthier and

566
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,320
that's that's what I stand behind and

567
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,159
the thing is like the longevity thing as

568
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,039
I was talking about so it means

569
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,679
basically the longevity stars of today

570
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
are saying don't eat fruit they're

571
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,880
saying we don't believe in longevity but

572
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,799
we're going to use the word and the term

573
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,760
yeah I know it's harsh I'm saying this

574
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,480
but I don't care I don't care it's

575
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,919
either what hold it back and not tell

576
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,080
you guys what's going on out there so

577
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,440
just what I'm worried some longevity

578
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,559
starts going to come out and start you

579
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,120
know saying stuff I mean the bottom line

580
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,600
is it's about you it's not about them

581
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,440
it's not about you know it's not about

582
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,760
what's going it's about you and here's

583
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,520
the deal we oxidize every day that's how

584
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,240
the aging process works we're

585
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,960
oxidizing bottom line oxidizing means

586
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,760
we're dying okay and you can turn that

587
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,520
around you can turn that around with

588
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,240
antioxidants that's the one word

589
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,039
that became pop became pop culture in

590
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,440
alternative medicine that is real it

591
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,039
really is real so I

592
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
congratulate

593
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,120

594
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,760

minute there's something in here that's

596
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,520
stopping oxidation inside this lemon

597
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,159
wait a minute um I could see it in the

598
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,840
lab in in the lab report there's an

599
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,559
antioxidant here you know I I

600
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,520
congratulate that guy okay that did that

601
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,880
because it's that important that

602
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,760
critical so what do antioxidants do they

603
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,440
stop your brain from

604
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,919
rotting that's what they do and they're

605
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,039
in fruits they're in all the fruits

606
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,600

keeps our hips from rotting it keeps you

617
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,000
so we don't get hip replacements all the

618
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,960
time antioxidant stop us from losing our

619
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,360
hips it stops us from getting to have to

620
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,559
get our knees

621
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,919
replaced you know and I understand that

622
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,799
I support that if someone's hip is going

623
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,480
and we have to replace it and and it's

624
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:56,760
gone too far I'm I'm I stand behind

625
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,000
technology today and surgical procedures

626
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,640
and surgeons and the work we've done in

627
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,520
medicine I stand behind that

628
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,919
100% I know surgeons that are doing

629
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,360
great and mean everybody's working hard

630
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,279
but the antioxidants stop more of that

631
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,440
from happening stop more of the

632
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:18,480
breakdown of the body on all levels and

633
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,640
where does that come from where does it

634
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,840
come from it comes from fruit you guys

635
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,679
comes from fruit you believe it I keep

636
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,039
on saying that bad word again over and

637
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,080
over again I hope I'm not going to get

638
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,799
in trouble all right so here's something

639
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,919
that's really funny right now okay in

640
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,279
the uh the Forefront of alternative

641
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,320
medicine one of the things they're

642
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:44,200
saying now is that fruit causes a fatty

643
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,279
liver fruit causes liver problems or a

644
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,159

680
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,679
now everybody's into the brain right you

681
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,679
guys are into the brain you know there's

682
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,600
brain books abound and there's brain

683
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,200
health this and brain health that right

684
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,000
totally I'm going to tell you right now

685
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,760
without fruit the brain shrinks it

686
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,399
shrinks because the brain is not made up

687
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,679
of fat it's a very micro small

688
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:30,720
percentage of Omega oils that are in the

689
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,760
brain the majority of the brain is made

690
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,960
of glycogen storage that's a thick gluey

691
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,799
carbohydrate and that's what conducts

692
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,559
electricity it's a carbohydrate in the

693
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,720
brain the brain is made out of

694
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:48,120
carbohydrates glycogen and fruit keeps

695
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,880
that glycogen stored in the brain so

696
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,480
your brain does not

697
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,799

change somebody's life I'll tell you why

713
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,720
cuz if you get somebody eating fruit and

714
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,960
they get into the habit and they bring

715
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,960
it in every day and it's in there every

716
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,080
day and twice a day three times a day

717
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,399
they're eating some fruit here's what

718
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,360
happens you stop Alzheimer's in their

719
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,840
life when they probably would have

720
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,279
gotten it there's a chance that that

721
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,279
person may have been an Alzheimer's

722
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,039
victim and that could have been their

723
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:56,240
demise way way down the road and you

724
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,600
just stopped it 30 years before it could

725
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,559
happen cuz you gave them a habit that

726
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,440
brought fruit into their life like the

727
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,240
wild blueberries like you know those

728
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,720
wild blueberries they are the ultimate

729
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,320
brain food of all time in history right

730
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,600
now on planet Earth is the wild

731
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,480
blueberry and it reverses not only

732
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,880
reverses brain diseases but it stops you

733
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,240
from losing you know your brain and

734
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,120
having it get corrosive and having heavy

735
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,840
metals wreak havoc and

736
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,000
oxidize oxidize the brain and cause of

737
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,360
memory loss and Alzheimer's and dementia

738
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,720
and and Parkinson's and everything else

739
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,399
that we that goes wrong in our brain and

740
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,240
wild blueberries stop that so when you

741
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,360
get somebody on fruit you get them on a

742
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,480
habit of it like yourself like yourself

743
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,799
and then you bump into somebody you're

744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,440
like hey you really need to be doing

745
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,720
this fruit you don't know it but you

746
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,039
might have stopped them from getting

747
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,880
dementia 20 years down the road what

748
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,640

749
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,840

758
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,159
biotic I talk about all the time like in

759
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,159
my book medical medium right you guys

760
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,679

761
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,919
biotic no one else knows about that's

762
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,080
really Advanced and ahead of everything

763
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,480

market and it's in season it's

771
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,399
incredible without a doubt but when

772
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,960
fruit goes out of season I don't want

773
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,399
you to stop eating fruit because it goes

774
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,279
out of season cuz I'm telling you right

775
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:48,559
now it's in season somewhere else

776
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,440
somewhere else on the planet it's in

777
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,200

you know Brazil or whatever it is and

782
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,279

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,919
the the minerals the active water in

846
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,120
melon it's the ultimate detoxifier pulls

847
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,080
all the poison out of the body can even

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,720
pull radiation along with it because the

849
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,840

alive and it's filled with so many

853
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,039
electrolytes that it literally grabs

854
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,120
onto everything that shouldn't be in the

855
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,720
body and pulls it out of the body some

856
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,159

book and everything and and that's been

974
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,920
around for a long time I've been pushing

975
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,640
the lemon water thing around for decades

976
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,599
I remember I was 6 years old and spirit

977
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,520
told me to have someone do lemon water I

978
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,880
was 6 years old if you go all the way

979
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,359
back then no one was talking about lemon

980
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,440
water in fact when you told somebody to

981
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,000
to actually do lemon water they looked

982
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,480
at you like you had 10

983
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,119
heads all right so you know that's the

984
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,040
same thing if you told somebody to be

985
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:13,000
weak gluten-free 35 years ago you know

986
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,440
40 years ago you tell somebody 40 years

987
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,560
ago to be weak gluten-free and yeah they

988
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
thought you just got off of a spaceship

989
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,880
so you know it's important to understand

990
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,960
that that you know I'm glad that we're

991
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,119

extracting dozens of precious trace

1009
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,680

1010
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,480

1012
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,800
know so we have to give Spirit a little

1100
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,800
credit here because it's not me

1101
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,520
delivering this information I'm just a a

1102
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,319
voice and a messenger from you know for

1103
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:26,119
Spirit let's go into some more grapes

1104
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,559
are you afraid of grapes that's that's

1105
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,839
what I want to know are you afraid of

1106
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,760
them because I hear about it all the

1107
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,720
time oh grapes whoa grapes sugar too

1108
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,960
much sugar and that's what I hear about

1109
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,160
grapes is that there's just too much

1110
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,040
sugar

1111
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,599
involved and but that's not accurate

1112
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,079
actually not accurate at all grapes

1113
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:53,559
don't have a lot of sugar I'm being

1114
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,720
straight about this they don't grape you

1115
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:56,720
know what grapes have they have a

1116
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,760
sourness to them

1117
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,280
they have a sour nature to them okay

1118
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,240
they have a tart nature if they had that

1119
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,800
much sugar they wouldn't be tart they

1120
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,119
wouldn't be slightly sour you wouldn't

1121
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:15,079
detect any sour nature you wouldn't

1122
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:18,200
detect any tartness to any Grape at all

1123
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,839
if there was that much sugar in grape

1124
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,920
there really isn't I mean of course if

1125
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:24,920
you juice tons and tons and tons of

1126
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,000
grape and then concentrate it then juice

1127
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,200
it then reconcentrate and concentrate it

1128
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,160
again you're going to then build up the

1129
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,680
fructose and that's what you're going to

1130
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,160
do but I'm talking about eating grapes

1201
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,440
what you don't know nobody knows is that

1202
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,520
the skin of the Fig feeds good bacteria

1203
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,200
but also has a phytochemical in there to

1204
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,880
kill bad bacteria so this information

1205
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:00,400
that's in a fig tree that's thousands

1206
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,079
thousands of years old in a fig tree

1207
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,160

some figs once in a while I mean you

1213
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,440
don't have to eat a ton of them just eat

1214
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,240
a handful of figs when they're out and

1215
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,920
maybe some dried fig high quality dried

1216
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,640
fix eat a couple of those once in a

1217
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,799
while that's what you need to do um and

1218
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,920
spirit says that you should eat your

1219
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,559
figs in nine in numbers of nine that's

1220
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,880
what Spirit tells me I have that in life

1221
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:38,119
changing Foods book so you really have

1222
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,119
to check this book out it's loaded with

1223
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,880
this information plus so much more I

1224
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,440
couldn't even cover it on these shows

1225
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,920
it's not possible to cover it on these

1226
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,640
shows there's no time to cover it

1227
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,599
there's too much information but eat

1228
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:55,720
your fig in number of nines that's nine

1229
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:57,520
figs a day okay that because every fig F

1230
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,760
tree every fig tree and I'm going to

1231
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,440
give you a piece of information that

1232
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,960
does that's not out there anywhere that

1233
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:09,040
comes from Spirit every fig tree ends on

1234
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,119
a nine meaning all the figs that grow on

1235
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,760
that tree that fall off the tree that it

1236
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,599
has in that season equal to number nine

1237
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,839
in the

1238
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,720
end never does it equal any other number

1239
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,599
it never lands on a two it never lands

1240
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,000
on a four it never lands on a five it

1241
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,799
ends on a nine and that's the power of

1242
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,680
the Fig tree and the universe and God to

1243
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:32,240
know that that's what happens with fig

1244
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,960
tree and then when you eat your figs in

1245
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,160
nine in a number of nine it's

1246
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,079
lifechanging and it helps reduce

1247
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,720
