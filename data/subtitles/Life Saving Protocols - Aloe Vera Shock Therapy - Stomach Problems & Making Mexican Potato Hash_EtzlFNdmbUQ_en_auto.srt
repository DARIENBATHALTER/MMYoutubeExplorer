everything and the antibiotics

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,199

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,360
do Alo shock therapy and their life

119
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,320
changes it is

120
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,199
mindblowing their life changes so I want

121
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,479
to just give you a little rundown really

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,560
quick I got an intestinal track in front

123
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:52,120
of me right here in front of you too and

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,560
what happens to people is bacteria over

125
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,240
time creates so much gas because it's

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,960
feeding off of things that it loves to

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,199
eat now over time Pockets develop in the

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,360
small intestinal tract expansions feal

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,560
matter starts to build up it gets

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
trapped In Pockets the pockets grow they

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,880
stretch and they

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,000
expand and in those Pockets more

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,919
bacteria lives lives happily it feeds

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,400
has a Feeding Frenzy it hides underneath

135
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:32,919
fecal matter undigested proteins it

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,680
hides under hardened encased fat that

137
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,080
sticks to the lining of the intestinal

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,960
tract and the colon and the bacteria has

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,919
a field day in there it produces ammonia

140
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,639
and other gases toxic gases those toxic

141
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,000
gases put pressure on the intestinal

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,400
tract lining when that pressure is on

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,520
the intestinal tract lining expansion

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,960
occurs elasticity starts to go away the

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,039
actual lining of the intestinal tract

146
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,199
starts to

147
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,479
weaken very important to understand and

148
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,680
as it starts to weaken expansions and

149
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,639
Pockets

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,280
develop and then we have more and more

151
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,599
problems with our intestinal tract

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,440
gastric spasms peristaltic action issues

153
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:25,000
pain burning

154
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,639
cramping it can be so debilitating it

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,960
could leave somebody in fetal position

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,440
on a daily basis after they go to

157
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,880
bathroom before they go to bathroom and

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,000
then there's the whole I didn't go to

159
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,759
bathroom enough I feel like I'm not

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,560
finished that's a whole another problem

161
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,759
all on its own I feel like I haven't

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,160
gone to bathroom enough like not enough

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,680
came out of me I didn't defecate enough

164
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,440
I didn't eliminate enough huge thing

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,720
that happens to people every day out

166
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,680
there they don't feel

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
satisfied and that's the thing they're

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,720
satis they're satisf action when we go

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,120
to the bathroom it's like we feel like

170
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,520

working okay the Plumbing's working okay

173
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,440

174
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,759
starts to break when it's not working so

175
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,080

186
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:55,159
problems for years do Alo shock therapy

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,080
and free themselves from surgery I've

188
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,440
seen it I've witnessed it I know doctors

189
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,879
who have seen it and witnessed it

190
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,039
through the medical m information so

191
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
this is probably one of the most

192
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,879
profound

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
episodes medical medium history right

194
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,599
here we're going to talk about how to

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,479
use aloe I'm excited and we're going to

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,240
have some fun make a Mexican potato hash

197
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,479
too so let's get into it a little bit

198
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,240
more in the intestinal tract and the

199
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,000
colon okay

200
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
so I want to move this

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
over

202
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,320
all right let's get into

203
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:42,919
it so we eat our food we eat our food

204
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,399
goes down into our stomach our HCL is

205
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,200
not strong enough doesn't break down the

206
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,240
proteins enough proteins drop into the

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,600
dadum from the dadum they enter the

208
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,000
small intestinal tra not properly

209
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,880
digested not properly broken down from

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,760
there

211
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:08,200
the proteins start to rot and then we

212
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:11,120
get gut rot with that gut rot is ammonia

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:15,120
a gas that's produced from the rotting

214
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,040
food the rotting food attracts

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320
menaces those

216
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,160
menaces are

217
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,880
bacteria

218
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,880
viruses yeast fungus unproductive fungus

219
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,920
even some different varieties of

220
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,120
mold but either way one thing's for

221
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,800
certain bacteria is going to lead the

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,040
way and it's going to be the one that

223
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,680
actually starts to feed off of all the

224
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,279
food that's rotting the undigested

225
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
proteins that are rotting as bacteria

226
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,920
feeds off of those undigested proteins

227
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,760
the bacteria

228
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:57,399
releases gas and toxins and spews and

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,000
releases excrement the bacteria

230
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,760
basically poops out

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,480
the excrement poops out the undigested

232
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,600
proteins the food and then now it's more

233
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,959
toxic than ever before and producing

234
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,399
more gas than ever before as this

235
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,519
process is happening pockets and

236
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,600
expansion start to occur in the small

237
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,760
intestinal

238
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,000
tract these pockets and expansions make

239
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,440
it so then we feel like we got a

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,480
stitch we actually have a stitch like

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
ooh what is this this is like whoa I

242
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,839
kind of feel this after I went to the

243
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,639
bathroom I don't know why this kind of

244
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,920
hurts these are what I call stitches not

245
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,279
the kind of stitches when you cut

246
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,279
yourself and you go and you get sutured

247
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,120
up not those kind of stitches stitches

248
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:48,600
where they feel like a sharp knife

249
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,880
jabbing you or like a pricker bush

250
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,480
inside of you or something where it's

251
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,079
sharp and Jagged and it gets you for a

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,040
minute and then it moves on along after

253
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,440
a little

254
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,639
while that Stitch can shift and now that

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
Stitch isn't up here anymore on the left

256
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,680
side now that Stitch is down lower on

257
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,760
the left side or that Stitch is down rer

258
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,519
on the right side down rer on the right

259
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,639
side down lower but the Stitch can move

260
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,279
and shift around so as our food is

261
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,360
rotting inside of our gut producing

262
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,800
ammonia gas and then a Feeding Frenzy

263
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,440
occurs bacteria mainly feeding off all

264
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,639
the different undigested proteins and

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
and the foods you're eating as this

266
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,560
keeps on going every single day week

267
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,320
after week week after week we get

268
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,800
expansions but we get expansions before

269
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,480
we get narrowing and narrowing is

270
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,560
another topic right here that's very

271
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,279
important

272
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,000
expansions are the first thing that

273
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,639
occurs and then narrowings come later

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,079
now how does a narrowing occur inside

275
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,040
the intestinal tract and what is a

276
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,800
narrowing it's when the intestinal tract

277
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,360
back starts to shrink in an area think

278
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,959
about a pipe and in that pipe a part of

279
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,480
the pipe has a different diameter a

280
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,120
smaller diameter so as food's going

281
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,519
through it ends up hitting a narrowing

282
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,920
but before we go into the narrowing I

283
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,959
want to finish up with the expansions

284
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,680
first thing that happens in people with

285
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,519
digestive problems is they get pockets

286
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
and

287
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,720
expansions so that means the intestinal

288
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,440
tract is pocketing out this isn't

289
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,000
diverticulosis or diverticulitis this

290
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,079
can be a healthy intestinal track that's

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,680
actually expanding from pressure not

292
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:46,160
just feal matter pressure that's

293
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,160
building up but ammonia gas pressure

294
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,880
from pathogens like the bacteria feeding

295
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,920
off of undigested

296
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,920
proteins as the expansion occurs to

297
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,120
regularly the the lining of the

298
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,399
intestinal tract the wall weakens when

299
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,639
the lining starts to

300
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,959
weaken we end up getting a narrowing the

301
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,360
reason why is because the lining is now

302
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,399
too

303
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,199
weak the flexibility goes the opposite

304
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,839
direction goes inward instead of

305
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:23,519
outward because the lining was stretched

306
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,680
so as Pockets develop in the small

307
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,560
intestinal tract and the Linings are

308
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,120
stretched CU these pockets are

309
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,279
outpocketing the lining weakens and then

310
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Falls

311
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:42,440
in and so as it falls in we now have

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,399
narrowing so what happens to people with

313
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,720
stomach problems and intestinal problems

314
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,440
they have pockets and narrowing so they

315
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,800
have some parts of the intestinal tract

316
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,800
where it gets

317
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,680
narrow some parts of the intestinal

318
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,639
tract it's wider and a pocket and this

319
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,639
can change and shift in different parts

320
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,000
of the intestinal tra over time but it

321
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:07,160
causes a lot of problems chronic

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,680
gastritis chronic gas chronic bloting

323
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,440
chronic stitches gastric spasms chronic

324
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,680
IBS chronic

325
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,800
constipation chronic

326
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
diarrhea we got all these different

327
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,600
issues because of what's Happening

328
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,240
inside inside the intestinal tract now

329
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,680
that's the intestinal tract I'm talking

330
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
about I'm not talking about the Elum and

331
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,519
then the ascending colon and then the

332
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,399
descending colon and then eventually out

333
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
the door I'm not talking about that

334
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,519
that's a whole another problem where

335
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
bacteria loves to sit now when people

336
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,240
get a sibo diagnosis what they're really

337
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,639
getting is a strep diagnosis inside the

338
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,880
intestinal tract inside the gut so when

339
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,440
someone goes to the doctor or the

340
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,600
practitioner and they say hey you got

341
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,240
sibo take this antibiotic you're blow in

342
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,920
this let's do a blood test let's do this

343
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,360
and that let's try to determine what you

344
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,199
have let's do a stol sample let's look

345
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
at some urine and in the end they'll

346
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,680
just be like well you have

347
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,240
sibo you have small intestinal bacterial

348
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,279
overgrowth

349
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,000
right but what kind of bacteria is it

350
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:20,959
the bacteria that's leading the way even

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,880
over sea diff inside people's guts is

352
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,480
Strep strep is that one bacteria that

353
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,199
reeks havoc and people have more

354
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,120
varieties than one

355
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,399
they'll have 10 varieties of strep

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,880
they'll have the strep that gave them

357
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,360
strep throat they'll have the strep that

358
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,399
gives them acne all over the place

359
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,279
they'll have the strep that gives them

360
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,240
stomach problems they'll have the strep

361
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,880
that gives them

362
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,759
UTI bladder infections and kidney

363
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,639
infections or commonly known as a yeast

364
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,199
infection which really is a strep

365
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,720
infection where there's yeast Gathering

366
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,480
but the St is the root

367
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,920
cause so what people do is they'll do an

368
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
antibiotic protocol maybe they'll start

369
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,519
with that then they'll be told lots of

370
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,319
lots of

371
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,800
probiotics and lots of prebiotics so

372
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,920
they'll be on all these probiotics and

373
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,680
all these

374
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,279
prebiotics and they'll be doing and

375
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,839
they'll be back and forth of this is

376
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,560
they get more stomach problems they

377
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
start to go away then they get stomach

378
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,000
problems again they get gastritis again

379
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,120
bloating constipation cramping diarrhea

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,959
IBS irritable bow syndrome which amazes

381
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,319
me because the

382
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,959
industry named it irritable bowel

383
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,639
syndrome made everybody think they

384
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,319
actually knew what was wrong but they

385
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,519
didn't it was just you got an irritable

386
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:46,720
vow that's all they had to offer was Sir

387
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,880
ma'am you got an irritable vow that was

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,519
it so people walk around with an IBS

389
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,560
diagnosis for years they're like well I

390
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,639
got IBS I got IBS well what is it oh

391
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,519
it's uh the doctor said it's IBS it's

392
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,880
irritable vowel syndrome so what the

393
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,160
doctor's saying is you have an irritable

394
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,760
bowel not why do you have an irritable

395
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,439
bowel or this is what's irritating it

396
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,919
and so forth Celiac suffers all the

397
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,720
same people walk around with a diagnosis

398
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,799
but they don't know what's causing it

399
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,959
Crohn's colitis Celiac

400
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,799
IBS gastritis it's another one all on

401
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,839
its own gastritis what's behind

402
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:28,480
it what's behind most of these

403
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,559
conditions is the bacteria and strep BAC

404
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,520
bacteria SEI can cause some problems

405
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,440
with people but CI is either on or it's

406
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,320
off it's hot or it's cold strep is hot

407
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,480
all the time and warm so it's always

408
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,200
there it's always wreaking havoc because

409
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,960
people don't know how to rid it or clean

410
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,480
it up or get rid of it and it waks Havoc

411
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,559
it sits inside their intestinal tract

412
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
forever and it causes problems so if you

413
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,240
guys just got here we're doing aloe vera

414
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,039
shock therapy you see a blender here cuz

415
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,760
I might pull off some aloe vera water

416
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,200
but I'm I'm going to show you though

417
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,280
different ways of eating aloe show you

418
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,760
some tips and how to cut it what you're

419
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,000
doing how you're not doing the green

420
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
skin so stick around because we got some

421
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,039
stuff to do and we got some ground to

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,600
cover right now we're talking about

423
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,520
digestive problems inflammation inside

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,039
the small intestinal tract and

425
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,840
colon and we can even talk about stomach

426
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,600
problems too for a little bit we might

427
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,240
head into there now

428
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,720
so I have a stomach in my hand right

429
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,640
here and inside a stomach are stomach

430
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,520
glands the stomach glands or gastric

431
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,919
glands they have to stay strong they

432
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,760
have to be superpowered that's your

433
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,360
gastric juice your gastric juices a big

434
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,880
part of how we break down our food break

435
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,799
down our proteins all of the above with

436
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,720
food they weaken in people people are on

437
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,320
coffee and vinegar and all kinds of

438
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,679
other things and they're under a lot of

439
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,400
stress and their gastric glands start to

440
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,039
get beaten down broken down and they

441
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,360
can't break down their food their HCL is

442
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,039
non-existent so their food is passing

443
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,880
through them and starting to rot as we

444
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,480
talked about

445
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
before another thing that people are

446
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,799
dealing with that are have gut problems

447
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,559
is liver issues so the minute someone

448
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,039
gets diagnosed with any kind of gut

449
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,640
issue whatsoever cron colitis IBS

450
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,400
gastric problems stomach cramps

451
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,080
gastritis whatever it is you have to

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,559
think liver is going to be

453
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,960
involved a weak stagnant sluggish

454
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,000
overburdened overworked liver that's

455
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,720
what's involved right there

456
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,120
and a liver that's getting fatty a fatty

457
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,600
liver even if it's not diagnosed such

458
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,600
livers are fatty before getting a fatty

459
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,720
liver

460
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,280
diagnosis you can have a liver issue

461
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,080
without having elevated enzymes liver

462
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,480
enzymes you can have a liver issue long

463
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,720
before there's an elevation of liver

464
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,679
enzymes important key to know might be

465
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,120
like hey my liver enzymes are good

466
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,400
doctor said I'm fine but I still got the

467
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,360
cramping and the bloating and my stomach

468
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,360
hurts or the burning in my stomach or

469
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:07,280
extra gas or my bathroom isn't right

470
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,039
however you see it or feel it the liver

471
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,640
plays a role so stagnant slish livers

472
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,080
and what happens is that strep bacteria

473
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,039
will sit and live inside the liver along

474
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,039
with other pathogens such as viruses and

475
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:24,039
so forth but the bacteria the strep live

476
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,480
in the liver it'll live in a

477
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,520
gallbladder it'll live in your stomach

478
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,320
it'll live live in your small testal

479
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,559
track your colon and it'll live right

480
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,320
outside your

481
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,640
anus right outside someone's anus strep

482
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,159
loves to be

483
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,799
there and it ends up on people's hands

484
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,039
and when it ends up on people's hands it

485
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,600
ends up on everything from grocery store

486
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,880
shopping carts the door handles to

487
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,240
everything else someone touches if

488
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,440
they're not washing their hands enough

489
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,440
they'll have the strep on their hands

490
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,039
and strep is interesting because when

491
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,919
people don't wash their hands and they

492
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,520
have it on their anus and they get it

493
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,640
back on their hand they end up putting

494
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,600
it back on their anus from their hand it

495
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,720
goes back and forth a symbiotic

496
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,880
relationship from somebody's hand to

497
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,640
their anus the strep passes back and

498
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,320
forth that's how how actually

499
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,159
tricky strep

500
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,840
is and crafty it is too all right let's

do I mean by taking out I mean you're in

738
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,919
pain you're just like what's going on

739
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,279
it's after I ate or before I ate or I

740
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,559
got too hungry or I'm not hungry enough

741
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,440
whatever it is that's going on people it

742
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,919
hits them hard and it hits them in the

743
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,080
strangest places you couldn't

744
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,000
believe I just couldn't

745
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,240
believe aloe vera has chemical compounds

746
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,559
that neutralize acid and Cal nerves in

747
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,360
the intestinal tract lighting so let's

748
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,919
go into a little bit we're going to be

749
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,320
showing you how to use aloe we still got

750
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,039
a Mexican potato hash to make which I'm

751
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,639
pumped up about all right so let's hit

752
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,960
the intestinal track a little bit real

753
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:19,039
quick here important to know

754
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,399
right

755
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,799
so that intestinal tract is lined with

756
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,360
nerves little tiny nerves that

757
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,679
eventually find their way two bigger

758
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,240
nerves and so all these little nerves

759
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,559
that are in in the intestinal tract

760
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,559
lining become hot I call them

761
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,880
hotpots for over three decades been

762
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,559
teaching people how to heal their gut

763
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,279
how to heal their intestinal tract and

764
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,200
it's a term that came from Spirit of

765
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,639
compassion long time ago where it's hot

766
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
spots in the intestinal tract hot spots

767
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:59,639
are little inflamed areas of the

768
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,120
intestinal tract lining that are

769
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:05,000
saturated with nerves and when anything

770
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,039
touches them the the nerves light right

771
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,399
up boom they light

772
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,320
up so you got food going through here or

773
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,399
a gas bubble going through here and the

774
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,440
minute that gas bubble touches one of

775
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,960
those hot

776
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,960
spots the whistle

777
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,559
Blows the Whistle blows the minute

778
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,720
something moves a piece of food

779
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,639
something happens something shifts or

780
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,120
peristaltic action occurs where all of a

781
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:32,120
sudden now your intestinal tract is

782
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,120
twisting it's twisting because it's

783
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,600
trying to move the food through a

784
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,279
message is coming from your brain right

785
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,440
to your intestinal tract lining and it's

786
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,320
twisting and try to get the message

787
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,960
through and get the food through and

788
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,799
when that happens hot spots occur and

789
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,399
you're like whoa whoa or oh whoa or oh

790
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,399
whoa and then you can be somebody that's

791
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,240
inflamed in one area right down here in

792
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:54,120
the Elum a lot of people are inflamed in

793
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,279
the

794
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Alum and as they're inflamed in the

795
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,639
elium down here deep right that little

796
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,480
section it stops food from passing

797
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,440
through easy so then they get bloated

798
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,800
and all the gas gets trapped in here and

799
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,760
builds up all the gas gets built up and

800
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,679
trapped in here it doesn't even reach

801
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,520
the colon your gas is way up high all

802
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,280
trapped

803
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,760
here we're in aloe vera shock

804
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,320
therapy all right Al has chemical

805
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,320
compounds that neutralize acid and calm

806
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,040
nerves in the intestinal tract Linings

807
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:36,960
slowing down and stopping intestinal

808
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,960
spasms so the goal with the aloe is to

809
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,280
slow down and stop intestinal tract

810
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,639
spasms aloe neutralizes acids and

811
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,919
inhibits bacteria and viral growth as

812
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,159
well as yeast unproductive fungus and

813
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,960
mold

814
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,480
growth she got all these people

815
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,919
something's growing inside of

816
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,720
them all these people out there and

817
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:03,359
something's growing inside their gut

818
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,800
unproductive fungus bacteria multiple

819
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,200
strains of

820
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,839
bacteria aund different strains of

821
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,960
bacteria that could not be good ones but

822
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,800
they're bad

823
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,839
ones unproductive fungus even

824
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,520
unproductive mold growth but a lot of

825
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,800
people have stuff growing inside their

826
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,440
guts and they can bombard the [ __ ] out

827
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,040
of their guts with probiotics they can

828
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,520
try this probiotic and this one and this

829
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,880
gas thing and this whatever and this and

830
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,480
they can do all the pill popping they

831
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,440
want and they can do all the powders

832
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,160
they want they can do all the

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,000
antibiotics they want and they can just

834
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,599
put stuff down and because they want to

835
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,680
heal their gut and it's not going to do

836
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,000
the

837
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,359
trick everything in there that's growing

838
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,040
that shouldn't be growing is growing and

839
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,560
growing and

840
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,240
growing it's why the medical medium

841
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,040
protocols in general

842
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,839
in general are so powerful like The

843
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,960
Liver Rescue smoothie heavy metal detox

844
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,280
smoothie the monoc cleans like all of

845
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,920
these different parts and tools for

846
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,200
medical medium information that's why

847
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,800
they're so powerful like the celery

848
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,920
juice because it inhibits and it's it

849
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,079
knocks down that bacteria it knocks down

850
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,920
that fungus that's

851
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,839
unproductive so let's go into this a

852
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,400
little bit suggested

853
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,280

narrowing and then what happens is

898
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,440
boom that pain

899
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,839

explanations understanding what's going

904
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,440

aspirin that was it and it carried all

909
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,960
the way until the microbiome guys kicked

910
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,400
in which is the functional medicine

911
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,160
doctor microbiome guys and they're just

912
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,400

let's hit

946
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,680
it all

947
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,680
right so here's what I want to do right

948
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,520
here can we get a closeup up there we go

949
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,520
awesome

950
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,839
um all right there's your aloe leaf

951
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,400
right there just going to move stuff

952
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:56,760
away a little bit so we can kind of get

953
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,800
a focus there it is what I what I do is

954
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,160
you see this knife right here you guys

955
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,800
on IG you probably can't see the closeup

956
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,000
but everybody on YouTube Rumble right

957
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,839
you guys can see

958
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,839
it so what I'm going to do is cut this

959
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,200
piece off here little too bitter you can

960
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:16,760
use it if you really want but it's kind

961
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,480
of hard to use this area so I like to go

962
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,400
just just deep enough like this so I

963
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,240
discard this or you can use it you can

964
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,640
put it on your skin you can do that if

965
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,520
you want to put it on your skin you can

966
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,119
do that like you

967
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,560
know can save that

968
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,079
piece all right 2 to 4

969
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,000
in of aloe so what do we do we can

970
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,240
measure it if we want I just just call

971
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,800
it by I that's about 1 inch right it's 2

972
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:50,280
in somewhere around there 3 in 4 in so

973
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,240
you can do 2 in so let's do that first

974
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,400
okay so I'm going to cut it just like

975
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,880
that you guys with me right here here

976
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,440
guys with me next there's a little

977
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,280
sticker on here this one's a store

978
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
bought

979
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,200
one and this one's from my garden right

980
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,119
here I'm going to open that up in a

981
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,280
little bit too my garden one doesn't

982
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,280
look as nice as the store bought one but

983
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,680
it is nice though all right so I'm going

984
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,680
to remove that sticker right

985
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,960
there okay what you do is you take the

986
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,640
knife and you don't cut it completely in

987
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,040
half I don't like to do that I cut just

988
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,440
the

989
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,800
top part down and then I open it like

990
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,240
this see this you guys now check this

991
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,800
out you would think that and you could

992
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,400
if you wanted to you can think that you

993
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,800
can use this knife and then slice the

994
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,359
green off now just so you know you don't

995
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,720
want the green involved you don't want

996
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:50,000
to eat the

997
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,480
skin you don't want to have the skin

998
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,160
mixed up in a blender you don't want to

999
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,760
grind it up you don't want the green

1000
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,480
skin you just want the gel inside now

1001
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm going to take a

1002
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,240
spoon I'm using the spoon see how I got

1003
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,680
the spoon this way not that way right I

1004
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,680
don't have it facing down I have the

1005
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,400
spoon facing up what I love about this

1006
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,319
trick once you get the hang of this it's

1007
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,880
the best way to do it I take the spoon

1008
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,079
facing up I stick it under this lip

1009
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,680
right

1010
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,119
here and

1011
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,839
then I keep the aloe

1012
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,000
down and the skin up see what's

1013
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,280
happening right here so I'm using a

1014
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,480
spoon to fillet the skin look how cool

1015
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,119
that is look at that right

1016
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,680
there see what I

1017
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,599
did there you

1018
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,079
go then I can do the same thing here I

1019
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,480
can actually fillet the skin with the

1020
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,200
spoon the spoon facing

1021
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,640
up now I cut that skin so that one's a

1022
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,599
little weird there so it is what it is

1023
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,079
but there you go so right now I have

1024
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,160
that set up now I like to do shot

1025
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,400
glasses put it in shot glasses it's one

1026
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,839
option right there what I have right

1027
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,680
here is a shot glass in front of me

1028
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:19,599
check this

1029
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,359
out that's one option the other option

1030
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,520
is I just like to eat it with a spoon

1031
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,000
that's what people should do they should

1032
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,720
learn to eat it with a spoon

1033
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,079
the aloe water is a great way to do it

1034
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,720
and I'm going to show you how to make

1035
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:39,119
that in a little while but I challenge

1036
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,640
you to learn how to consume this in the

1037
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,319
most potent

1038
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:48,040
way the most potent way is not in the

1039
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:50,920
water that's not the most powerful way

1040
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,520
to use it to heal and to use it as a

1041
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,119
powerful healing tool no the most

1042
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,599
powerful way is eating a shrink

1043
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,559
right here eating it straight so you

1044
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,640
take the

1045
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:09,359
spoon and you go down and you scoop it

1046
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,040
right off like that and that's the most

1047
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,280
the best way to eat it is this way and

1048
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,280
that's the most powerful

1049
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
way

1050
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,240
yeah H to taste really good if you don't

1051
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,079
like the taste of

1052
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,839
aloe over time you'll learn about it and

1053
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,440
mean mean sorry over time you'll

1054
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,160
acclimate to the flavor and you'll start

1055
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,800
to enjoy it and you'll start liking it

1056
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,680
now I'm going to put in a shot glass now

1057
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,160
you got the shot glass right

1058
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,680
here so I'm going to take this next

1059
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,599
piece with a

1060
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,920
spoon and I'm going to put it in the

1061
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:51,760
shot glass just like that now you can

1062
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,760
actually scrape down to the skin and get

1063
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,880
a little bit more but remember this the

1064
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,079
closer you get to the skin the more

1065
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,440
bitter it

1066
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,319
is like medicine bitter so the closer

1067
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,319
you get to the skin to get the aloe and

1068
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:09,680
I do that I scrape it down to the skin

1069
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,280
but I know that a lot of people aren't

1070
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,319
going to like that because it's going to

1071
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,280
have like what feels like a nasty

1072
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,119
taste when it's down to the skin so you

1073
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,559
can you don't have to do that you don't

1074
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:25,119
have to scrape it down you just

1075
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,160
don't but what you do is you can make a

1076
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,599
shot glass right here you can put them

1077
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,440
in the fridge and you can have it set up

1078
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,240
so when you're doing medical medium aloe

1079
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,839
vera shock therapy and you're doing it

1080
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,839
every two

1081
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,800
hours you're doing it every four hours

1082
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,760
you can actually just have it in shot

1083
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
glasses prepared ready just like this so

1084
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,160
I'm going to move this over just's cut

1085
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,160
another

1086
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,920
piece

1087
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,640
okay all right now couple of things to

1088
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,160
know

1089
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,960
As you move down this

1090
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,680
Leaf it's going to turn pink or red so

1091
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,559
if you keep this in your fridge it's in

1092
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,839
there for a long time the aloe leaf will

1093
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,800
eventually start to oxidize and it'll

1094
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,480
start turning pink or red and it usually

1095
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,960
turns pink or red down by the tail in

1096
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,280
the lower

1097
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,520
sections so if you're you're trying to

1098
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,319
keep the aloe around longer for like a

1099
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,760
week in the fridge or two weeks in the

1100
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:26,440
fridge or something like that you might

1101
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,760
want to start eating from bottom up

1102
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,400
believe it or not where you cut the tail

1103
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,720
off discard that cuz that's hard to

1104
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,280
really get that aloe out unless you

1105
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,000
squeeze it out and you use it for

1106
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:43,319
something for skin or so forth

1107
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,720
right all right so let's go let's cut

1108
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:49,800
another piece now 2 in you can do a 4 in

1109
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:54,119
now I like bigger pieces like

1110
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,160
this right there see that I like a nice

1111
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,640
big piece like that so I'll show you one

1112
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,800
more time how to do this and we'll pop

1113
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,400
this in the

1114
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,480
blender so I'm going to take the knife

1115
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,000
and I'm going to cut right here on top

1116
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm not going to cut deep I'm not going

1117
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,920
to go like that okay I'm going to cut

1118
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,200
right on the top just the

1119
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,839
surface like

1120
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:25,839
this open it up just like that take a

1121
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:28,280
look right once again you take the spoon

1122
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,040
face the spoon up this is the best way

1123
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,920
to do it I promise you this is the best

1124
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:36,079
way to do it when you play with aloe

1125
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,440
this is the only way to do it take the

1126
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,319
spoon facing

1127
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,640
up and you follow the skin like this

1128
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,640
there you

1129
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,319
go right on down it doesn't get any

1130
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:52,960
better than that that's the way you

1131
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:56,520
fillet a fish an aloe fish it's not a

1132
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,079
fish and then I'll get the other side

1133
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,960
right

1134
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,960
now once you learn

1135
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:09,160
this there you go that's how you fillet

1136
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,160
aloe vera right there until this day

1137
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:15,680
I've never seen anybody do it that way

1138
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,680
out there never seen it

1139
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,839
ever and it's the best way by far to do

1140
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,839
it so let's go into this a little

1141
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,280
bit um

1142
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,000

1176
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,880
the years with aloe vera shock

1177
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:12,520

1180
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,880

week it's another thing too you don't

1190
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,200
have to do the shock therapy where

1191
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,119
you're in this crisis or you want to do

1192
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,280
it every 2 to 4 hours cuz you're in this

1193
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,359
crisis you're really inflamed maybe

1194
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,079
you're somebody with colitis and you had

1195
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:57,880
a relapse with your colitis and it

1196
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,839
you're so inflamed and you're suffering

1197
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,200
that could be a time to do also the the

1198
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,720
shock therapy you could do the shock

1199
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,839
therapy you're somebody with chronic

1200
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,599
gastritis but you're welcome just to do

1201
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:12,200
it daily where you buy aloe and you're

1202
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:16,960
doing a piece of aloe every single day 2

1203
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:19,040
oz every single day okay to prepare the

1204
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,119
aloe gel carefully slice open your 2 to

1205
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,040
4 inch piece of aloe vera leaf I love

1206
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,319
how the directions are actually in here

1207
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,680
trimming away the green spikes now what

1208
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,480
you'll see is I did not trim away the

1209
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,720
green

1210
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,440
spikes you might be somebody where you

1211
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,520
actually know kind of like to stay away

1212
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,839
from these you just don't don't grab it

1213
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,440
like squeeze on the spikes or anything

1214
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:43,559
like that and you'll see um I'll show

1215
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,720
you twoo like this these spikes some of

1216
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,640
them are just razor sharp like a cactus

1217
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,520
I mean they're just really sharp some

1218
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,760
are kind of dll these are a little bit

1219
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:57,520
more dull on the dull side but

1220
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,440
anyway make sure you do not use the skin

1221
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,400
as you're scooping out the Alo gel try

1222
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,160
not to scrape to the skin like I taught

1223
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,200
you before the chemical compound in the

1224
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,359
green skin can be irritating for some

1225
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,680
people so you don't want to eat the skin

1226
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:11,119
I can't tell you how many people I'm

1227
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,280
like you got to do some aloe it's going

1228
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,119
to really help and they take the skin

1229
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,559
and everything they throw it in the

1230
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,280
blender and then I think even somebody

1231
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,839
on social like I don't know if it was a

1232
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,280
year ago or two years ago they were

1233
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:24,000
showing people how to eat aloe or

1234
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,200
something it was like a chef and they

1235
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,520
just threw the whole leaf in the blender

1236
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:33,079
skin in all and spikes in all and I was

1237
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:35,559
like oh man I was like holy crap that's

1238
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,880
not good I I feel bad for anybody eating

1239
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,359
that right there I was like oh my God I

1240
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,599
mean I was scared for people because it

1241
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,799
could be

1242
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:44,119
irritating I was I was just don't know

1243
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:47,839
why people do

1244
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:49,640
that and eat the gel straight if

1245
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,760
possible for best results but if you

1246
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:57,880
have to put it in the fridge in a shot

1247
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,880
glass or a little glass bowl you can do

1248
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,000
that remember cut off the very edge as I

1249
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,799
talked about and discard that it's way

1250
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,200
too

1251
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,760
bitter okay so that's some of the tips

1252
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,880
right here which are really cool you're

1253
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,599
welcome to prepare all of your aloe gel

1254
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,559
for the day at once you can do that as

1255
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,079
well put it in airtight airtight

1256
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,599
container in the

1257
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:22,240
fridge if you're storing a partial Leaf

1258
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,079
wrap the cut end in a damp towel or

1259
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,160
plastic wrap if you really want and

1260
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,960
place it in the refrigerator avoid Alo

1261
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:34,280
leaves where the gel is very red inside

1262
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:37,640
like tomato red inside okay it's

1263
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,640
oxidized it's just going bad so keep

1264
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,079
that in mind these leaves aren't fresh

1265
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,520
they're starting to Decay when doing the

1266
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,480
aloe vera shock therapy eat it straight

1267
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,960
or Blended in water do not add to

1268
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,319
smoothies it doesn't work the same when

1269
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,760
it's added to smoothies very important

1270
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,079
piece of

1271
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,839
information all right

1272
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,559
let's

1273
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:04,680
roll a little bit

1274
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:07,960
here get this uh blender over here for a

1275
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,640
moment yep plugged in ready to

1276
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,640
roll let's scoop some

1277
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,599
aloe make some aloe water you can do it

1278
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:19,960
this way I love it this way too don't

1279
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:26,280
get me wrong it's the second best option

1280
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:27,680
versus eating it keep that in mind nice

1281
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,599
it's getting

1282
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:34,839
slippery but that's just how the story

1283
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,839
goes all

1284
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:41,760
right we got that in there let's add

1285
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,760
some

1286
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,119
water up to you on how much water you

1287
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,119
want to add I don't like adding a

1288
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
lot

1289
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,520
so

1290
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,720
all right that's

1291
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,520
good you don't want to like fill your

1292
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,559
blender like this High unless you have a

1293
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,520
lot of aloe in there that's 4 in a

1294
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,920
little bit more it's a really healthy

1295
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,920
size

1296
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,760
Leaf run let's

1297
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920

there it

1306
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,760
is now a lot of people would prefer this

1307
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,640
they don't want the slimy texture of the

1308
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,760
aloe they feel like it's too slimy it's

1309
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,480
too um it's gross some people will just

1310
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,720
think it's just gross

1311
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,400
but the most powerful way to consume it

1312
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:34,480
and eat it is like I was showing you

1313
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,039
before taking it scooping it right out

1314
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,160
eating it direct let's go into like when

1315
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,200
to eat it after meals if you're somebody

1316
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,440
that suffers with digestive problems

1317
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,799
after they eat acid reflux gastric pain

1318
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,280
bloating maybe burning in the stomach

1319
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:50,079
that's a really good one too A lot of

1320
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,319
people have ulcers or they're just

1321
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,359
burning in the stomach because their

1322
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:55,760
nerves are on fire because they're

1323
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,720
inflamed so their intest inal nerves and

1324
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,240
the nerves around their stomach are just

1325
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,039
hotwired because they're inflamed and

1326
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,280
because of that they're going to feel

1327
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:06,359
like burning instantly or there's

1328
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,760
somebody that's dealing with H pylori

1329
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:11,200
they got mini ulcers that aren't even

1330
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,480
detectable with an endoscopy not even

1331
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,160
detectable in any way shape or form

1332
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,400
maybe an ultrasound doesn't show

1333
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,760
anything and they just have burning it's

1334
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,960
mysterious burning going on that means

1335
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,160
that you could have these little micro

1336
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,599
Fishers they're just undetectable

1337
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,760
they're really tiny from H pylori from

1338
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:32,440
strep bacteria from different varieties

1339
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,680
of bacteria in the gut and when that's

1340
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,559
happening okay even viruses too like

1341
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:42,480
viruses that are behind

1342
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:45,640
colitis either way eating aloe directly

1343
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,280
after eating food is an option so if you

1344
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,039

1360
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,520

let's make the Mexican potato hash let's

1428
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:36,920
see if we can make it

1429
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:39,559
right all right got the pan on let's get

1430
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,920
some potatoes on here boom throwing that

1431
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:44,279
heat on

1432
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,359
maximum that's right going to move my

1433
01:02:44,279 --> 01:02:50,720
aloe water I'll drink that later going

1434
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:53,039
to get rid of this too I'm

1435
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,440
excited I'm taking a shortcut I'm using

1436
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,480
steamed potatoes the recipe calls for

1437
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,960
raw

1438
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,680
potatoes I'm taking a shortcut because I

1439
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,039
wanted to first of all I had steamed

1440
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,520
potatoes on hand second of all you know

1441
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,559
we're just you know we're spending a lot

1442
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,559
of time we'll be here for 4 hours if I

1443
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,680
have to do it that way all right let me

1444
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,240
move these over a little

1445
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,079
bit let's make this happen got some

1446
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,480
potatoes right here look at the size of

1447
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:23,119
this potato this is crazy let's cut this

1448
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,279
up I'm going to like do a little cubing

1449
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:30,799
on this so what I'm going to do is I'm

1450
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:33,079
going to cut it in half like that maybe

1451
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,440
another here like

1452
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:37,799
that I'm just going along with the

1453
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,480
program here in the sense like you know

1454
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:42,079
what I want them cubed so let me go

1455
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,880
along with naturally happens right here

1456
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,359
so then I'm going to cut it like

1457
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,599

like they look at you and be like well I

1532
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,960
I had food poison at some point that's

1533
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,880
the only way I can reference it that's

1534
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,920
another thing too aloe vera shock

1535
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,799
therapy for food poisoning recovery

1536
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,200
chemical sensitive people when people

1537
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:38,559
are chemical sensitive they're afraid to

1538
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,039
do anything they're afraid to take

1539
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:44,000
anything they're just so nervous they're

1540
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:47,160
so scared and they do aloe

1541
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,359
vera it's so gentle on them probably one

1542
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,559
of the most gentlest powerful way for

1543
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:54,319
somebody who's chemical sensitive they

1544
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,079
got food sensitivities it's it's another

1545
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,520
thing too but the problem is a food

1546
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,160
sensitivi is you go to a doctor you get

1547
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,440
the allat or you get like a food

1548
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,160
sensitivity scan next thing you know it

1549
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,760

1550
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,319
sensitive to aloe vera well I never had

1551
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,680
aloe vera before they're like yep you're

1552
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:11,440
sensitive to it then you lose an

1553
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,440
opportunity to

1554
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,159
heal I'm going to be using spices today

1555
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:20,480
if you have digestive problems you don't

1556
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:23,159
have to use the spices you don't have to

1557

okay um if you're sensitive in any way

1560
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:33,440
you can leave the spices out all right

1561
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:36,480

feeding pathogens it's medical medium

1971
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:05,639
information the health movement has

1972
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:08,119
changed because of mm info it is not

1973
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:09,360
what it was it has changed and if you're

1974
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:12,119
young and you don't know this you have

1975
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:15,080
no idea where 80% of all this stuff came

1976
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:17,800
from the mm information it's completely

1977
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,560
tipped over on its Edge it's changed

1978
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,320
completely and then the liver problems

1979
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,280
here's another one that's medical Med

1980
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,239
skin issues caused by liver problems

1981
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:30,719

1983
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:33,840
see that now doctors are like if you

01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,040
have a sluggish liver you have weight

1985
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,440
gain there's no science behind a

1986
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,119
sluggish liver and weight gain that's

1987
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:42,920
medical medium information published

1988
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:44,800

1989
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:46,600
every chronic illness the liver having a

1990
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,159
problem in many ways cuz the pathogens

and everything

1992
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,360
else and the reason why they talk about

1993
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,760
the the liver now is because of the

1994
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,679

1995
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,719
