[0.60 - 5.64] I've always wanted to do when we do that
[2.76 - 7.86] the best of our ability but we need
[5.64 - 11.10] something in people's hands like a
[7.86 - 13.38] resource of some kind that can help what
[11.10 - 14.94] happens is PTSD is a huge one when
[13.38 - 15.90] someone goes through trauma shock or
[14.94 - 18.06] loss
[15.90 - 20.16] anything like that betrayal broken trust
[18.06 - 22.62] whatever it is
[20.16 - 25.14] PTSD can happen it can happen actually
[22.62 - 27.54] really fast it can happen in days can
[25.14 - 29.82] happen in weeks can happen in years but
[27.54 - 31.56] it does happen and what I love about the
[29.82 - 35.34] stabilizer trauma shock and loss
[31.56 - 37.68] stabilizer is it has a punch to it to
[35.34 - 40.02] help rewire the brain so that's what
[37.68 - 44.58] we're doing today you guys
[40.02 - 45.96] trauma shock and loss stabilizer for day
[44.58 - 48.06] 12 of the medical medium brain shot
[45.96 - 51.12] therapy cleanse challenge
[48.06 - 54.80] what happens is to rewire the brain it
[51.12 - 60.18] takes more than just
[54.80 - 61.98] mental counseling therapy right it takes
[60.18 - 64.74] more than that because when we go
[61.98 - 66.96] through trauma shock or loss
[64.74 - 69.12] something physical happens to the brain
[66.96 - 71.34] and that's something that people don't
[69.12 - 73.14] realize out there science of research
[71.34 - 75.60] doesn't know this
[73.14 - 77.46] so when we go through an experience a
[75.60 - 79.92] difficult experience
[77.46 - 82.68] physically we get injured
[79.92 - 86.40] not just emotionally so it's not just
[82.68 - 88.38] soul and emotion and spiritual and
[86.40 - 90.00] mental and mental health it's physical
[88.38 - 91.50] and what happens is when there's a
[90.00 - 94.32] physical injury that happens in the
[91.50 - 97.08] brain from trauma shock or loss
[94.32 - 100.38] we end up in a situation
[97.08 - 103.62] where we have symptoms because of it
[100.38 - 105.84] and then those symptoms are seen as if
[103.62 - 107.94] the person is just emotionally unstable
[105.84 - 109.26] so say the person goes and sees a
[107.94 - 111.90] psychiatrist because they've been
[109.26 - 113.94] through trauma shock or loss
[111.90 - 116.52] psychiatrist is going to be like oh this
[113.94 - 119.64] person's unstable
[116.52 - 121.92] really no this person has an actual
[119.64 - 124.74] physical injury inside the brain
[121.92 - 126.56] because of the trauma shotgun laws
[124.74 - 129.72] and then yes
[126.56 - 130.74] emotional symptoms can arise from it you
[129.72 - 134.46] guys good to see you I'm actually
[130.74 - 136.62] excited can I read a little bit
[134.46 - 138.00] I'm gonna go to page 76 but first of all
[136.62 - 140.10] let me just show you right here we're
[138.00 - 142.44] making the trauma shocking loss

[204.90 - 208.40] you if that's okay
[209.58 - 214.76] the Heat of the Moment paid 76 of brain
[212.46 - 214.76] saver
[214.86 - 220.14] as we go through life we come across
[217.68 - 222.66] difficult situations
[220.14 - 224.34] betrayal
[222.66 - 226.80] have you experienced betrayal in your
[224.34 - 230.04] life I know I have
[226.80 - 231.48] loss The Experience lost in your life I
[230.04 - 233.16] know I have
[231.48 - 234.24] heartbreak
[233.16 - 239.22] yes
[234.24 - 239.22] loneliness yes confrontation
[239.46 - 244.88] all of us experience these one way or
[242.64 - 244.88] another
[244.92 - 248.42] somehow or some way
[248.76 - 253.20] we get emotionally hurt have you been
[251.58 - 258.08] emotionally hurt
[253.20 - 258.08] I know I have I've been emotionally hurt
[259.02 - 264.00] we get emotionally hurt
[261.30 - 266.46] and the physical aspect of this goes
[264.00 - 269.22] wholly ignored so what I was saying
[266.46 - 271.98] before is when we get emotionally hurt
[269.22 - 274.38] there's a physical aspect there's a
[271.98 - 278.54] physical injury
[274.38 - 278.54] something happens to us physically
[278.60 - 287.66] but that's never understood totally
[282.60 - 287.66] ignored holy ignored
[288.02 - 294.48] we need to address the physical core
[290.94 - 296.16] strength of our brain
[294.48 - 300.42] so that no matter what we're
[296.16 - 303.48] experiencing emotionally like someone
[300.42 - 305.70] harming someone else emotionally
[303.48 - 308.70] or what we're thinking
[305.70 - 311.76] that intercourse strength of our brain
[308.70 - 313.62] can survive emotional injuries
[311.76 - 315.00] that's the part that people don't
[313.62 - 317.34] realize
[315.00 - 320.28] that we need a strong brain
[317.34 - 322.68] so what medical mean information does is
[320.28 - 326.10] it helps to support
[322.68 - 327.96] people's brains to make them stronger
[326.10 - 330.72] because
[327.96 - 332.46] we're not in control of other people's
[330.72 - 334.56] free will
[332.46 - 338.40] other people on this planet have their
[334.56 - 342.14] own free will and it doesn't stop them
[338.40 - 342.14] from harming someone
[342.60 - 346.80] you can still get emotional injuries
[344.48 - 351.48] losses and hardships
[346.80 - 354.42] we can't control all that in this world
[351.48 - 357.54] but what we can control
[354.42 - 360.06] is the atmosphere of our brain
[357.54 - 363.06] and what we can control is the
[360.06 - 365.88] environment inside our brain
[363.06 - 368.46] we can control that we may not be able
[365.88 - 369.96] to control the hard-hitting punches we
[368.46 - 373.80] get emotionally
[369.96 - 375.36] betrayal broken trust loss
[373.80 - 378.90] trauma
[375.36 - 383.40] mental abuse we may not have control
[378.90 - 387.24] in receiving any or all of that
[383.40 - 390.12] but we may be able to control
[387.24 - 392.76] the environment inside the brain to make
[390.12 - 395.84] us stronger to be a shield
[392.76 - 395.84] for all of that
[397.56 - 401.88] the physical aspect of this goes wholly
[399.66 - 404.82] ignored we need to address the physical
[401.88 - 406.26] core strength of our brain so that no
[404.82 - 408.54] matter what we're experiencing
[406.26 - 410.82] emotionally or what we're thinking that
[408.54 - 414.20] inner core strength of our brain can
[410.82 - 417.78] survive emotional injuries
[414.20 - 421.86] when we have a loss or betrayal
[417.78 - 424.14] God knows right we've all had those
[421.86 - 426.30] our physical brain
[424.14 - 428.58] can become injured
[426.30 - 430.38] especially if our brain doesn't have
[428.58 - 432.12] what it needs and that's what I love
[430.38 - 435.36] about the trauma shock and loss
[432.12 - 437.10] stabilizer it offers something for the
[435.36 - 440.04] internal workings of the brain the
[437.10 - 443.22] physical brain
[440.04 - 446.76] part of what injures the brain is not
[443.22 - 450.00] the broken trust itself
[446.76 - 453.06] someone breaks the trust
[450.00 - 455.34] and we're hurt and we feel that hurt
[453.06 - 458.16] that hurt is deep
[455.34 - 460.56] we're on page 76 someone just asked a
[458.16 - 463.92] brain saver
[460.56 - 466.92] I'll show you do you have this book
[463.92 - 468.78] this is the brain saver book
[466.92 - 473.84] part of what injures the brain is not
[468.78 - 473.84] the broken trust itself right has anyone
[474.06 - 479.40] broken trust
[477.18 - 484.22] in your life
[479.40 - 484.22] it's the fire that occurs
[484.92 - 491.10] when an event like this happens
[488.58 - 494.58] when trust is broken it's not the broken
[491.10 - 497.88] trust itself that's injuring the brain
[494.58 - 499.74] it's the fire that blows up inside of
[497.88 - 502.32] the brain
[499.74 - 504.86] that creates the injury from that broken
[502.32 - 504.86] trust
[508.28 - 516.62] that fire is the heating up of the brain
[512.40 - 516.62] an intense electrical Heat
[517.32 - 522.06] someone had it right 200 years ago when
[519.96 - 525.18] they noticed that a friend needed to
[522.06 - 527.28] blow off steam
[525.18 - 529.14] someone had something right 300 years
[527.28 - 532.10] ago when they called another person
[529.14 - 532.10] hot-headed
[532.44 - 537.48] not that someone needs to seem angry or
[535.32 - 540.00] irate on the surface for the brain to
[537.48 - 543.00] heat up someone
[540.00 - 545.52] sometimes when not showing emotion the
[543.00 - 547.82] fire inside the brain Burns hotter than
[545.52 - 547.82] ever
[548.28 - 554.34] you could be lying in bed hurt by
[550.74 - 558.78] betrayal how many people do you know
[554.34 - 560.64] that were lying in bed hurt by betrayal
[558.78 - 562.02] you're lying in bed you're hurt by
[560.64 - 564.12] betrayal you wake up in the morning
[562.02 - 566.70] you're hurt by betrayal
[564.12 - 568.68] betrayal's a tough one
[566.70 - 571.56] I can't tell you how many knives I've
[568.68 - 573.30] had to pull out of my back
[571.56 - 576.06] myself
[573.30 - 579.02] throughout my life it's like oh hold on
[576.06 - 579.02] you guys hold on
[580.04 - 583.58] hold on you guys
[584.22 - 587.90] let's pull out another knife out of my
[585.78 - 587.90] back
[590.70 - 594.54] you could be lying in bed hurt by
[592.56 - 597.72] betrayal wake up in the morning hurt by
[594.54 - 601.02] betrayal not expressing a word not even
[597.72 - 604.76] talking just thinking
[601.02 - 604.76] feeling and remembering it
[605.76 - 609.66] you can be hurt
[607.32 - 611.58] by betrayal without realizing it and
[609.66 - 614.22] you're lyingly or upset while the fire
[611.58 - 617.22] burned really bright inside your brain
[614.22 - 619.14] and overheating occurred you may not
[617.22 - 622.14] have noticed that because it's hard to
[619.14 - 623.52] know but the brain goes on fire when
[622.14 - 625.14] we're betrayal and maybe you can't
[623.52 - 627.92] identify that that's what it is but
[625.14 - 627.92] that's what it is
[628.56 - 634.44] because publicly medical research and
[632.22 - 636.24] science publicly known medical research
[634.44 - 639.06] in science
[636.24 - 641.76] no only a tiny tiny fraction about the
[639.06 - 645.42] brain in this day and age
[641.76 - 648.06] this brain heating can't be measured
[645.42 - 650.22] your brain heating up from betrayal
[648.06 - 653.28] can't be measured your brain heating up
[650.22 - 655.56] from trauma or loss or mental abuse
[653.28 - 657.06] can't be measured science doesn't have a
[655.56 - 659.72] way to measure it they don't even know
[657.06 - 659.72] what's happening
[660.12 - 666.72] if by some miraculous chance the Earth
[662.88 - 669.02] is still alive one thousand years from
[666.72 - 669.02] now
[669.36 - 676.08] and not a dead rock floating along
[673.02 - 678.92] we still won't know everything about the
[676.08 - 678.92] human brain
[680.76 - 685.50] if this Earth is still alive a thousand
[683.22 - 688.08] years from now and not a dead rock with
[685.50 - 692.30] no human beings on it or wildlife
[688.08 - 692.30] that would be a miracle all on its own
[692.66 - 698.64] Bonafide miracle for sure
[696.24 - 701.10] miraculous miracle
[698.64 - 703.08] but if this Earth was to still be here a
[701.10 - 707.16] thousand years from now and not a dead
[703.08 - 710.40] Rock annihilated by nuclear waste
[707.16 - 713.46] annihilated by sea trails
[710.40 - 716.94] annihilated by GMO food
[713.46 - 719.22] if this Earth is still alive
[716.94 - 721.38] a thousand years from now
[719.22 - 724.88] medical research and science still won't
[721.38 - 724.88] know everything about the brain
[725.88 - 731.28] no matter how advanced science gets
[728.40 - 734.46] because there's a sole aspect of the
[731.28 - 736.68] brain that science will never understand
[734.46 - 738.84] and it's intertwined with the rest of
[736.68 - 740.22] our brain and science will never have
[738.84 - 742.20] those answers
[740.22 - 744.90] ever
[742.20 - 747.36] even if this Earth is still
[744.90 - 750.92] alive and breathing and the Earthly
[747.36 - 750.92] mother is alive
[751.44 - 755.52] even though the overheating of our
[753.42 - 758.06] physical brains can't be weighed or
[755.52 - 758.06] measured
[762.48 - 768.42] it is just as real as the burn you get
[765.42 - 770.70] from touching a hot stove
[768.42 - 773.10] it's as real as spilling hot coffee in
[770.70 - 775.74] your lap the heating of the brain it's
[773.10 - 778.02] as real as walking barefoot across a
[775.74 - 781.14] scalding parking lot to get to the beach
[778.02 - 782.88] if you ever had that experience
[781.14 - 785.04] this heating of the brain occurs
[782.88 - 787.50] instantly when we experience an
[785.04 - 790.92] emotional challenge of any kind it could
[787.50 - 794.10] happen at any moment in someone's life
[790.92 - 797.70] where a burning sensation we can't
[794.10 - 800.28] understand mental Agony inside our brain
[797.70 - 803.70] is what it amounts to
[800.28 - 806.54] an IG Starlet says oh my God
[803.70 - 806.54] mind-blowing
[811.32 - 817.62] a heating occurs in the brain
[814.14 - 820.68] that heating you may not feel like the
[817.62 - 823.50] hot Touch of a stove but a mental Agony
[820.68 - 825.12] is what you're feeling from the heating
[823.50 - 826.38] of that brain
[825.12 - 828.92] and what you're going through
[826.38 - 828.92] emotionally
[829.38 - 834.56] it can happen in a minute in someone's
[832.32 - 834.56] life
[842.58 - 846.96] it even happens when people are merely
[844.74 - 848.16] frustrated with whatever situation is
[846.96 - 851.64] before them have you ever been
[848.16 - 853.58] frustrated I just frustrated
[851.64 - 857.10] frustrated about anything or everything
[853.58 - 858.72] we get heating inside the brain our
[857.10 - 861.62] brain gets hot inside just from
[858.72 - 861.62] frustration alone
[862.26 - 868.08] the fire in our brain can burn at
[865.38 - 871.20] different heat levels no matter
[868.08 - 873.24] the level it burns and it can't be
[871.20 - 876.32] measured by medical research and Science
[873.24 - 876.32] and never will be
[878.52 - 884.88] if you've ever heard of the phenomenon
[880.80 - 888.36] of spontaneous self-combustion
[884.88 - 890.94] have you ever heard of that phenomenon
[888.36 - 893.24] it's actually related to this electrical
[890.94 - 893.24] Heat
[893.64 - 897.54] for those that don't know what that is
[895.50 - 898.86] spontaneous self-combustion it's when
[897.54 - 900.36] someone's just standing there and
[898.86 - 902.52] everything's fine or sitting in the
[900.36 - 904.80] rocking chair or sitting on their front
[902.52 - 906.66] porch and all of a sudden internally
[904.80 - 909.12] there's a fire that starts a physical
[906.66 - 910.80] fire and it starts to burn all through
[909.12 - 913.44] their organs until literally they're
[910.80 - 915.66] nothing but Ash and their their shoes
[913.44 - 917.94] are left
[915.66 - 921.24] as if it was the Wicked Witch of the
[917.94 - 923.40] West on The Wizard of Oz
[921.24 - 926.52] we're one of the wicked witches
[923.40 - 928.94] I forget I haven't seen a movie in very
[926.52 - 928.94] long time
[930.48 - 935.10] if you've ever heard of the phenomena on
[932.34 - 937.26] spontaneous combustion self-combustion
[935.10 - 940.80] it's actually related to this electrical
[937.26 - 943.32] heat science research doesn't know this
[940.80 - 944.70] so there's no citation in here because
[943.32 - 946.08] science of research doesn't know this
[944.70 - 947.52] information this is medical medium
[946.08 - 949.98] information of what causes self
[947.52 - 952.92] combustion
[949.98 - 954.78] Reiki with Daria I've always felt the
[952.92 - 956.94] overheating Sensation that I described
[954.78 - 958.56] to doctors but never had anyone speak to
[956.94 - 960.60] it
[958.56 - 963.24] surprise surprise surprise Spirit of
[960.60 - 964.44] compassion always surprises us all the
[963.24 - 968.06] time
[964.44 - 968.06] with just Advanced information
[968.28 - 972.60] it blows my mind all the time just so
[970.26 - 974.40] you know I'm just I get mind blown just
[972.60 - 975.66] like anybody else who reads these books
[974.40 - 978.80] and
[975.66 - 978.80] learns this information
[979.56 - 983.82] so we're talking about spontaneous
[981.24 - 986.16] self-combustion
[983.82 - 988.80] it's actually related to this electrical
[986.16 - 992.10] heat science research doesn't know this
[988.80 - 994.98] when there's a specific when there's a
[992.10 - 998.34] very specific recipe inside someone's
[994.98 - 1001.06] body creating elevated ammonia levels in
[998.34 - 1001.06] the bloodstream
[1001.16 - 1006.50] people walk around with ammonia gas
[1004.28 - 1009.46] it's a ghost like gas that floats
[1006.50 - 1009.46] through their bones
[1010.22 - 1016.00] and drives through their bloodstream and
[1013.52 - 1016.00] organs
[1016.10 - 1020.42] when there's a very specific recipe
[1018.08 - 1023.12] inside someone's body creating elevated
[1020.42 - 1026.12] ammonia levels in the bloodstream a
[1023.12 - 1029.60] spark off the brain's electrical grid
[1026.12 - 1032.60] can cause combustion
[1029.60 - 1034.70] keep in mind you need a lot going wrong
[1032.60 - 1036.26] for spontaneous self-combustion so I
[1034.70 - 1039.98] don't want anybody in fear about that
[1036.26 - 1042.50] because you need a serious recipe
[1039.98 - 1044.18] in order for spontaneous self-combustion
[1042.50 - 1046.22] to to occur
[1044.18 - 1049.88] to begin with
[1046.22 - 1052.04] the stage is set from one putrified
[1049.88 - 1054.32] proteins rotting inside the intestinal
[1052.04 - 1056.90] tract and other sources of fermentation
[1054.32 - 1059.36] in the blood from weak digestion and
[1056.90 - 1060.98] Foods fermenting inside the gut all of
[1059.36 - 1063.50] which adds to the ammonia in the
[1060.98 - 1065.84] bloodstream two
[1063.50 - 1068.60] chronic dehydration
[1065.84 - 1072.14] meaning never enough water in the
[1068.60 - 1075.38] bloodstream and three high blood fat
[1072.14 - 1077.78] levels from a high fat diet then if
[1075.38 - 1079.64] there's also continual overheating of
[1077.78 - 1082.64] the brain from a maxed out electrical
[1079.64 - 1084.44] grid due to brain betrayer toxins and a
[1082.64 - 1087.56] lack of electrolytes trace minerals and
[1084.44 - 1088.76] glucose the grid can spark and catch the
[1087.56 - 1091.46] ammonia
[1088.76 - 1093.80] alcohol consumption increases someone's
[1091.46 - 1096.64] chances of self-combustion as does
[1093.80 - 1096.64] smoking anything
[1098.00 - 1102.52] Deborah McVeigh more mind-blowing
[1100.34 - 1102.52] information
[1102.56 - 1107.18] brain heat can also be an aspect of
[1105.20 - 1109.46] someone feeling like Madness is taking
[1107.18 - 1110.84] over so before I go into that I want to
[1109.46 - 1111.62] talk about the self-combustion a little
[1110.84 - 1113.84] bit
[1111.62 - 1116.48] it's a rare phenomenon but if the recipe
[1113.84 - 1119.30] is just right in a person
[1116.48 - 1121.94] that ammonia that's in their bloodstream
[1119.30 - 1124.46] that gas can ignite
[1121.94 - 1128.14] and when it ignites the person Burns
[1124.46 - 1128.14] internally from the inside out
[1133.16 - 1137.48] brain heat can also be an aspect of
[1135.62 - 1139.10] someone feeling like Madness is taking
[1137.48 - 1141.44] over
[1139.10 - 1144.08] where you almost can't stand it anymore
[1141.44 - 1146.30] or stand yourself like Madness is taking
[1144.08 - 1148.22] over your mind you're upset with
[1146.30 - 1150.62] yourself or you're upset with something
[1148.22 - 1154.72] or you're upset with someone else and it
[1150.62 - 1154.72] feels as if Madness is taking over
[1154.82 - 1158.36] so many people doubt themselves when
[1156.98 - 1160.10] they're going through an emotional
[1158.36 - 1163.46] experience do you doubt yourself when
[1160.10 - 1167.00] you go through an emotional experience
[1163.46 - 1170.00] they ask am I going crazy did you ever
[1167.00 - 1173.12] ask yourself am I going crazy
[1170.00 - 1175.76] did that ever come to your mind at all
[1173.12 - 1178.04] did you ever ask yourself that ever at
[1175.76 - 1181.60] any point in time
[1178.04 - 1181.60] am I going crazy
[1183.92 - 1189.62] you're not going crazy
[1186.80 - 1193.10] they're experiencing intense heating of
[1189.62 - 1197.00] brain tissue in an emotional center of
[1193.10 - 1199.94] the brain eventually reaching all areas
[1197.00 - 1202.22] of the brain at some point this is often
[1199.94 - 1204.74] heightened by toxic heavy metals which
[1202.22 - 1207.08] everybody has in their brains and other
[1204.74 - 1209.24] chemical poisons present in the brain's
[1207.08 - 1210.68] emotional Center so inside their
[1209.24 - 1212.48] emotional Center they can have the
[1210.68 - 1214.34] metals and other toxins and other
[1212.48 - 1216.76] chemicals all in there that shouldn't be
[1214.34 - 1216.76] in there
[1217.88 - 1223.24] stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot
[1224.66 - 1229.66] Trail is one of the hottest burners
[1229.94 - 1235.82] someone cheats on you that's one of the
[1232.76 - 1238.46] hottest burn
[1235.82 - 1240.20] someone doesn't understand you and they
[1238.46 - 1242.84] make a decision without your permission
[1240.20 - 1245.20] that affects your life that burns real
[1242.84 - 1245.20] hot
[1246.58 - 1252.26] loss feeling like
[1249.28 - 1254.24] we can't get back something we lost
[1252.26 - 1257.30] whether it's a loved one a person a
[1254.24 - 1262.24] thing a place something we lost that
[1257.30 - 1262.24] burns really hot inside our brain
[1262.94 - 1268.06] stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot
[1268.28 - 1273.92] and we're not just talking about one
[1270.62 - 1275.18] angry spell a year which still Burns hot
[1273.92 - 1277.04] we're talking about everyday
[1275.18 - 1279.08] frustrations too
[1277.04 - 1280.76] for example driving to work in traffic
[1279.08 - 1283.28] when you're late
[1280.76 - 1285.14] slow down or stuck in a light causes the
[1283.28 - 1287.48] brain to heat up even the slightest bit
[1285.14 - 1289.28] it still causes it to heat up having a
[1287.48 - 1291.26] difficult conversation can cause the
[1289.28 - 1293.66] brain to heat up
[1291.26 - 1294.98] participating in a virtual meeting can
[1293.66 - 1296.36] cause the brain to heat up and that's
[1294.98 - 1297.98] what's happening so many people are in
[1296.36 - 1299.84] Virtual meetings these days their brain
[1297.98 - 1300.62] heats up from just being in a virtual
[1299.84 - 1304.28] meeting
[1300.62 - 1306.86] because video calls often involve an
[1304.28 - 1309.20] additional form of stress
[1306.86 - 1311.24] whether from spotty internet connections
[1309.20 - 1313.22] that cause delays participants talking
[1311.24 - 1315.50] over one another or because we tend to
[1313.22 - 1318.26] raise our voice increase facial
[1315.50 - 1320.42] expressions or emphasize body language
[1318.26 - 1322.82] when we feel the format isn't allowing
[1320.42 - 1324.50] us to project our message can even raise
[1322.82 - 1326.54] the brain's heat I'm just giving
[1324.50 - 1328.82] examples of how the brain's heat can be
[1326.54 - 1331.40] raised
[1328.82 - 1334.94] Brad Danielson says what chapter is this
[1331.40 - 1337.04] word page 77 or in the emotional brain
[1334.94 - 1339.02] chapter of brain saver thank you for
[1337.04 - 1341.78] asking
[1339.02 - 1343.82] the brain heat of life's challenges is
[1341.78 - 1347.18] harder on the chronically ill
[1343.82 - 1349.22] I want to emphasize that a little bit
[1347.18 - 1351.32] if you have a symptom or you're on
[1349.22 - 1355.34] mattress island or you're struggling the
[1351.32 - 1357.68] heat the brain heat does affect us more
[1355.34 - 1359.24] if we're chronically sick if we're
[1357.68 - 1361.58] struggling with a symptom or condition
[1359.24 - 1363.62] if we're struggling with any kind of
[1361.58 - 1365.60] diagnosis or any symptoms that are
[1363.62 - 1367.58] holding us back
[1365.60 - 1369.68] if we are fatigue we don't feel good
[1367.58 - 1372.50] body aches and pains if we have brain
[1369.68 - 1375.32] fog the brain heat does increase
[1372.50 - 1377.18] the brain heat of life's challenges is
[1375.32 - 1379.10] harder on The Chronic Leo science
[1377.18 - 1380.96] research doesn't even know this
[1379.10 - 1383.00] Nicholas Russell says where the heck
[1380.96 - 1385.42] else can you get this kind of info
[1383.00 - 1385.42] nowhere
[1386.36 - 1391.70] I'm honored to be the messenger of this
[1389.06 - 1394.10] information from Spirit of compassion
[1391.70 - 1397.22] on IG there's no other place that you
[1394.10 - 1402.74] can get this awesome amazing info
[1397.22 - 1405.68] that's Hemi Hemi mom on IG
[1402.74 - 1407.78] but you guys know what happens
[1405.68 - 1411.74] bits and pieces are stolen all the time
[1407.78 - 1413.06] never cited back we see it over here all
[1411.74 - 1415.58] day long out there
[1413.06 - 1416.90] from all kinds of you know gurus and
[1415.58 - 1418.46] health professionals just taking the
[1416.90 - 1420.38] info Non-Stop
[1418.46 - 1423.28] it's happened to me for decades but it's
[1420.38 - 1423.28] happening more than ever
[1423.50 - 1429.68] and I'm just a dirty Secret
[1426.86 - 1433.76] a dirty Secret at this point
[1429.68 - 1436.04] for so many to get the information from
[1433.76 - 1438.56] it's crazy
[1436.04 - 1440.36] and all that does is cheat people out
[1438.56 - 1442.34] who need the information so they can
[1440.36 - 1444.44] heal and have a chance to save their
[1442.34 - 1446.84] life
[1444.44 - 1448.28] the brain heat of life's challenges is
[1446.84 - 1450.38] harder on The Chronic allele because
[1448.28 - 1452.30] they're often stuck in bed and people
[1450.38 - 1456.88] don't realize when someone's chronically
[1452.30 - 1456.88] ill and they're stuck in bed
[1457.22 - 1461.30] how
[1458.96 - 1463.16] it's Amplified
[1461.30 - 1465.38] no one understands that when you're
[1463.16 - 1467.60] actually illing you're actually not well
[1465.38 - 1468.98] and you have to be couch bound or bed
[1467.60 - 1471.32] bound a lot
[1468.98 - 1473.42] you can't play the reindeer games that
[1471.32 - 1475.54] everybody wants to play
[1473.42 - 1478.22] that everybody's out there playing
[1475.54 - 1479.84] you're really trying to reserve you're
[1478.22 - 1482.24] trying to get better you're trying to
[1479.84 - 1483.92] heal and when we go up against emotional
[1482.24 - 1485.78] hardships or emotional struggles when
[1483.92 - 1488.54] we're trying to heal and we're bed bound
[1485.78 - 1491.18] the brain Heats even more intense and
[1488.54 - 1493.58] people don't know this or realize this
[1491.18 - 1495.32] the chronically ill or anybody who's
[1493.58 - 1497.42] sick and struggling
[1495.32 - 1500.78] they have more than just their symptom
[1497.42 - 1502.28] to contend with it's not easy at all so
[1500.78 - 1504.08] when betrayal happens when you're
[1502.28 - 1506.60] chronically sick or any kind of hardship
[1504.08 - 1508.58] or loss it's even more of a difficult
[1506.60 - 1511.66] situation that's why they chronically
[1508.58 - 1511.66] he'll have it so difficult
[1511.76 - 1517.70] they're too fatigued to walk it off
[1515.48 - 1519.56] you know what I hear from people know
[1517.70 - 1520.46] what I hear from influencers out there
[1519.56 - 1522.50] too
[1520.46 - 1524.06] they're like well when my anxiety is up
[1522.50 - 1526.54] I just hop on the treadmill and I run
[1524.06 - 1526.54] for an hour
[1527.36 - 1531.32] what about somebody who's a mattress
[1529.16 - 1533.66] Island chronically ill and sick
[1531.32 - 1535.28] and
[1533.66 - 1538.40] and they're not at that industry
[1535.28 - 1541.04] indestructible moment in their life
[1538.40 - 1542.66] and they're bedridden or having problems
[1541.04 - 1544.46] or
[1542.66 - 1546.68] they're struggling in other ways severe
[1544.46 - 1548.66] fatigue they can't just run off their
[1546.68 - 1550.34] anxiety they can't just go and run for
[1548.66 - 1553.18] an hour run off their anxiety and have
[1550.34 - 1553.18] it all just go away
[1554.60 - 1560.42] because they're often stuck in bed
[1557.18 - 1562.00] they're too fatigued to walk it off
[1560.42 - 1564.38] they're too fatigued to go exercise
[1562.00 - 1566.48] singing sweetie says this makes so much
[1564.38 - 1567.92] sense as to why my healing is taking so
[1566.48 - 1571.46] long and it does it takes longer because
[1567.92 - 1574.78] of that but it's okay it's okay but it
[1571.46 - 1574.78] does take longer because of that
[1575.12 - 1577.72] foreign
[1579.50 - 1582.86] there's still plenty of Hope to recover
[1581.36 - 1584.30] and get better it just takes a little
[1582.86 - 1585.38] longer for so many people because of
[1584.30 - 1587.24] this
[1585.38 - 1589.58] they're too fatigued to walk it off and
[1587.24 - 1591.32] just go exercise they're too fatigued to
[1589.58 - 1593.54] distract themselves and run around and
[1591.32 - 1595.52] do appointments all day and self-care
[1593.54 - 1599.60] appointments all day and go out to lunch
[1595.52 - 1601.76] at a busy restaurant and everything else
[1599.60 - 1603.08] they can't just shake it off it's not
[1601.76 - 1605.54] easy to shake off when you're
[1603.08 - 1607.46] chronically sick plus if you have PTSD
[1605.54 - 1608.56] if you're chronically sick what if you
[1607.46 - 1613.04] got
[1608.56 - 1615.08] lots of PTSD and OCD because you've been
[1613.04 - 1617.24] sick too long sick for a long time
[1615.08 - 1619.76] you've been to too many doctors too many
[1617.24 - 1621.50] experiences with family and friends that
[1619.76 - 1624.62] haven't been positive you've been
[1621.50 - 1628.66] struggling looking for answers
[1624.62 - 1628.66] if you just can't shake it off
[1628.76 - 1634.40] a lot of people run from their stress
[1631.58 - 1636.14] that's what people do they run from
[1634.40 - 1637.76] their stress they make appointments if
[1636.14 - 1639.98] they have the resources they go and do
[1637.76 - 1641.24] self-care all day long they go and do
[1639.98 - 1644.54] this they go out with their friends they
[1641.24 - 1646.82] go out for lunches they run away from
[1644.54 - 1650.36] their stress they can burn off the
[1646.82 - 1653.84] adrenaline also called epinephrine
[1650.36 - 1655.82] created by mild Stress and Anxiety by
[1653.84 - 1657.26] keeping busy with activities all day
[1655.82 - 1660.86] long
[1657.26 - 1662.96] and wearing themselves out
[1660.86 - 1665.36] so that the thoughts don't keep cycling
[1662.96 - 1667.16] they get to run it off so the thoughts
[1665.36 - 1669.08] don't recycle over and over again their
[1667.16 - 1670.40] stress doesn't recycle they're out there
[1669.08 - 1672.50] doing this doing that they're doing
[1670.40 - 1675.80] whatever they're just they're staying
[1672.50 - 1680.26] ahead of it right because they can
[1675.80 - 1680.26] the Divine loaf says
[1680.36 - 1685.70] and then Health gurus and influencers
[1682.82 - 1688.30] just say you just don't have the right
[1685.70 - 1688.30] mindset
[1688.52 - 1690.70] foreign
[1691.00 - 1696.74] do they ever say that and boy does that
[1694.94 - 1699.52] get my goat
[1696.74 - 1699.52] totally
[1701.06 - 1706.84] people who are chronically ill don't
[1703.58 - 1706.84] have the option
[1707.18 - 1711.34] when you're stuck on your mattress
[1709.10 - 1711.34] Island
[1712.28 - 1718.82] you can get caught up in your headspace
[1715.46 - 1722.84] no one understands this
[1718.82 - 1724.88] unless you've gone through it
[1722.84 - 1726.50] when you're stuck on mattress Island you
[1724.88 - 1731.92] can get caught up in your head space
[1726.50 - 1731.92] with your brain fire burning hotter
[1732.08 - 1736.46] it's like adding insult to injury
[1734.54 - 1739.22] because you're already dealing with the
[1736.46 - 1741.56] physical challenges that have isolated
[1739.22 - 1744.64] you in the first place in your life and
[1741.56 - 1744.64] have you stuck in bed
[1751.22 - 1755.60] you guys just so you know we're in brain
[1753.02 - 1757.10] saver I'm now on page 78.
[1755.60 - 1760.22] and kind of just walking you through
[1757.10 - 1762.44] some of the information in here
[1760.22 - 1763.46] brain heat can even burn on a different
[1762.44 - 1765.74] level
[1763.46 - 1768.08] with a different kind of heat when
[1765.74 - 1770.84] everything is good and happy
[1768.08 - 1773.54] that's because when we're having fun the
[1770.84 - 1776.18] brain still runs hot the difference is
[1773.54 - 1778.16] that the brain's cooling mechanisms
[1776.18 - 1781.28] which we'll explore later are usually
[1778.16 - 1783.68] enough to temper that type of heat
[1781.28 - 1785.42] that said it's the reason why people
[1783.68 - 1788.18] with chronic illness can find that
[1785.42 - 1790.52] experiencing a little happiness is hard
[1788.18 - 1792.56] on them I know people throughout the
[1790.52 - 1796.58] years that were so sick that even
[1792.56 - 1798.56] experiencing happiness was a lot
[1796.58 - 1801.26] that was hard on them
[1798.56 - 1803.12] even experiencing Joy was hard on them
[1801.26 - 1804.68] because they were so sick
[1803.12 - 1807.44] they had so many different nervous
[1804.68 - 1809.78] system conditions the brain fog all
[1807.44 - 1811.40] kinds of OCD all kinds of issues they're
[1809.78 - 1813.50] suffering they're struggling and then
[1811.40 - 1815.66] they get told some good news
[1813.50 - 1817.82] and it's hard to even take in the good
[1815.66 - 1821.06] news it's like it's it's hard because
[1817.82 - 1823.22] it's it's intense even a little bit of
[1821.06 - 1826.48] brain heat on good news is hard for
[1823.22 - 1826.48] someone who's chronically ill
[1827.78 - 1832.10] it's why those who are very ill in the
[1830.36 - 1834.74] hospital can't have too many visitors
[1832.10 - 1836.54] wishing them well on a birthday it
[1834.74 - 1838.34] generates way too much heat in the brain
[1836.54 - 1840.74] that's why someone in the hospital
[1838.34 - 1843.92] really really sick you gotta walk in
[1840.74 - 1845.66] quiet and everybody's walking in quiet
[1843.92 - 1847.46] and they're trying not to say anything
[1845.66 - 1849.74] and then when two family members are
[1847.46 - 1852.32] arguing why the person's in bed in the
[1849.74 - 1854.48] hospital sick someone else says hey wait
[1852.32 - 1856.64] a minute we might not want to have an
[1854.48 - 1858.08] argument right now why Grandma's sitting
[1856.64 - 1861.02] in the bed
[1858.08 - 1864.76] are laying in the bed in the hospital
[1861.02 - 1864.76] or anybody not even Grandma whatever
[1865.04 - 1870.74] Andrea says did anybody
[1868.28 - 1872.12] got the name of the book please brain
[1870.74 - 1875.42] what
[1872.12 - 1877.76] brain saver and brain saver protocols
[1875.42 - 1880.88] that's one book they're just splitting
[1877.76 - 1885.02] after two over 600 page Bibles right
[1880.88 - 1887.68] here I'm on page 76 78 lost that one 78
[1885.02 - 1887.68] a brain saver
[1888.50 - 1890.68] foreign
[1897.02 - 1900.68] so let's go a little bit more and this
[1898.70 - 1902.00] is really cool good information right
[1900.68 - 1904.34] here
[1902.00 - 1907.06] I've known people who say oh whoa this
[1904.34 - 1907.06] is really good too
[1908.78 - 1914.54] even when we're not ill the brain heat
[1911.18 - 1916.94] that happens generates can be exhausting
[1914.54 - 1919.28] I've known people who say they love
[1916.94 - 1921.92] every part of putting together a dinner
[1919.28 - 1925.10] party and have an amazing time talking
[1921.92 - 1927.50] all night and then feel completely wiped
[1925.10 - 1929.54] out and exhausted the next day if you
[1927.50 - 1932.06] ask them if they wanted to do it all
[1929.54 - 1934.76] over again the next day they would feel
[1932.06 - 1937.40] reluctant they put on a big dinner party
[1934.76 - 1940.22] they're not sick they worked really hard
[1937.40 - 1941.54] they entertained 50 people came rolling
[1940.22 - 1943.82] into their house
[1941.54 - 1946.94] right they had a huge dinner party
[1943.82 - 1949.82] that's because the brain ran hot from
[1946.94 - 1951.86] all the fun you can get burnt out from
[1949.82 - 1954.38] too much fun there are people in the
[1951.86 - 1957.56] world who have the means to play all
[1954.38 - 1959.48] they want they're loaded with cash they
[1957.56 - 1961.40] can play and do anything they can go
[1959.48 - 1965.06] anywhere they want and they end up
[1961.40 - 1968.84] needing vacations from their vacations
[1965.06 - 1971.18] I know a lot of wealthy people
[1968.84 - 1973.10] out there in the world
[1971.18 - 1974.54] personally I know a lot of wealthy
[1973.10 - 1976.82] people out there
[1974.54 - 1978.74] and what I find
[1976.82 - 1980.96] from the wealthy people that I know out
[1978.74 - 1984.32] there in the world
[1980.96 - 1986.24] is that they vacation a lot
[1984.32 - 1990.08] like a lot
[1986.24 - 1993.26] they're traveling all around the world
[1990.08 - 1996.74] they're on boats they're on yachts
[1993.26 - 1998.78] they're on planes constantly
[1996.74 - 2000.46] traveling overseas
[1998.78 - 2002.56] they're here they're there they're
[2000.46 - 2004.54] skiing down here they're up here now
[2002.56 - 2007.18] they're in Aspen now they're in Germany
[2004.54 - 2009.88] though whatever they're in Switzerland I
[2007.18 - 2011.62] know a lot of wealthy people and they
[2009.88 - 2013.90] play a lot
[2011.62 - 2017.02] but they have to take vacations after
[2013.90 - 2020.38] they play a lot their lives their lives
[2017.02 - 2022.66] are almost permanently vacationed
[2020.38 - 2025.36] because they're playing so much because
[2022.66 - 2027.10] they have the wealth to do it
[2025.36 - 2030.10] that they need to take vacations
[2027.10 - 2030.10] constantly
[2031.90 - 2037.68] I usually say to me aw why don't you
[2034.12 - 2037.68] take a vacation and I'm too busy working
[2038.86 - 2043.84] I haven't taken a vacation ever
[2040.90 - 2045.70] I'm too busy working
[2043.84 - 2047.68] and they're always like I don't
[2045.70 - 2049.84] understand that I don't understand that
[2047.68 - 2051.82] I go don't worry you take another
[2049.84 - 2055.30] vacation
[2051.82 - 2057.40] because that's what people do right
[2055.30 - 2059.02] they need vacations from their vacations
[2057.40 - 2060.52] from their vacations from their
[2059.02 - 2063.10] vacations
[2060.52 - 2065.86] or they need chill time for days
[2063.10 - 2069.10] afterwards a chance to do nothing at all
[2065.86 - 2071.50] and increase self-care protocols lots of
[2069.10 - 2072.58] massages lots of massages to recover for
[2071.50 - 2075.46] many of the excitement from their
[2072.58 - 2077.98] vacations they need massages when they
[2075.46 - 2080.86] come home from their vacations
[2077.98 - 2083.02] they had a fabulous trip which was
[2080.86 - 2084.90] intended to be self-care to begin with
[2083.02 - 2087.40] in the first place no matter who you are
[2084.90 - 2089.32] and how lucky you are in life you still
[2087.40 - 2091.06] have to protect your brain is what I'm
[2089.32 - 2093.10] saying even from people who are having
[2091.06 - 2094.18] fun all the time still have to protect
[2093.10 - 2096.46] their brain
[2094.18 - 2100.36] on IG
[2096.46 - 2102.46] see Visa Hill says the fact that he's
[2100.36 - 2104.74] not charging us for this info should
[2102.46 - 2106.66] tell people that he's the real deal and
[2104.74 - 2108.70] really cares about helping others can I
[2106.66 - 2110.50] just add something to that
[2108.70 - 2112.42] can I add this the medical meeting
[2110.50 - 2114.46] podcast in apple podcast doesn't have
[2112.42 - 2116.74] commercials or advertisers
[2114.46 - 2118.12] and it's a top podcast in the world of
[2116.74 - 2119.50] Health

[2122.02 - 2126.52] commercials

[2126.52 - 2131.32] to free from the burden of your ear
[2128.98 - 2133.54] having to be sold stuff all the time
[2131.32 - 2135.28] when you go listen to a podcast
[2133.54 - 2137.80] and it makes me no money because I don't
[2135.28 - 2141.46] have advertisers in front of my podcast
[2137.80 - 2143.68] I could charge thousands per person
[2141.46 - 2145.72] for like a huge program or something
[2143.68 - 2147.82] like that to hand out this unique
[2145.72 - 2150.10] information I can box up all the books
[2147.82 - 2152.44] keep it away from the world I could put
[2150.10 - 2154.06] subscription fees all over my website I
[2152.44 - 2155.38] can't tell you I have a top website in
[2154.06 - 2158.26] the world

[2159.64 - 2165.12] information it's incredible information
[2161.08 - 2165.12] but I don't put paywalls up

[2168.04 - 2172.54] medal well here I do want a metal it's

[2178.06 - 2181.24] people to heal
[2179.32 - 2183.64] go to medicalme.com check out the
[2181.24 - 2185.92] website so much information on there
[2183.64 - 2188.32] it's it's actually incredible it's an
[2185.92 - 2190.78] incredible resource go on the newsletter
[2188.32 - 2193.66] too the newsletter we we like do all
[2190.78 - 2195.34] kinds of cool stuff the light blast is
[2193.66 - 2199.20] free
[2195.34 - 2199.20] I did a free light blast
[2201.28 - 2205.54] and I'm happy to do so
[2203.14 - 2208.36] but you need to be on the newsletter
[2205.54 - 2211.24] and I'm not complaining or anything but
[2208.36 - 2212.20] all this stuff running a website like
[2211.24 - 2215.26] that
[2212.20 - 2219.70] and the amount of team that you need and
[2215.26 - 2221.56] the amount of costs are insane and I put
[2219.70 - 2222.94] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[2221.56 - 2225.54] upon thousand upon thousands of dollars
[2222.94 - 2225.54] into it all
[2227.56 - 2230.58] blah blah blah
[2230.92 - 2235.20] so I want to talk a little bit more
[2232.96 - 2235.20] about
[2235.48 - 2239.20] um
[2237.04 - 2242.14] the solution here isn't to stop yourself
[2239.20 - 2244.72] from having emotions we don't have total
[2242.14 - 2247.08] control over that anyway we can make
[2244.72 - 2249.94] what feels to be a lot of progress
[2247.08 - 2252.22] emotionally with conquering demons we
[2249.94 - 2254.92] can move mountains in our emotional
[2252.22 - 2257.80] state and that does not mean we will
[2254.92 - 2259.90] stop having emotions I don't care what
[2257.80 - 2262.30] anybody says
[2259.90 - 2264.52] they're still going to have emotions
[2262.30 - 2265.84] I don't care what Guru says they control
[2264.52 - 2267.04] their emotions they're still going to
[2265.84 - 2269.74] have emotions
[2267.04 - 2272.98] no one on this planet
[2269.74 - 2275.50] is emotionless
[2272.98 - 2277.66] no one
[2275.50 - 2280.12] life is not a definitive mapped out
[2277.66 - 2282.52] journey we know that our life is not
[2280.12 - 2285.40] somebody else's life
[2282.52 - 2288.58] yet if you look at the lives of others
[2285.40 - 2291.34] they can seem to have a good run of it
[2288.58 - 2294.76] for a little while and when we can think
[2291.34 - 2298.84] they have life figured out slowly
[2294.76 - 2300.94] their best life moments in public
[2298.84 - 2303.52] behind the scenes they're running into
[2300.94 - 2305.74] emotional quicksand so I'm not reading
[2303.52 - 2307.42] this so great right here I'm bouncing
[2305.74 - 2308.68] around what I'm trying to say is people
[2307.42 - 2310.48] can seem like they got their
[2308.68 - 2312.82] together totally together everything
[2310.48 - 2314.44] solid as a rock but behind the scenes
[2312.82 - 2317.20] they're running into emotional quicksand
[2314.44 - 2319.72] more than we know you can see it on IG
[2317.20 - 2322.18] you can see it in Social everywhere
[2319.72 - 2325.48] people they have a different thing going
[2322.18 - 2327.52] on for the public eye right influencers
[2325.48 - 2329.92] have a different thing going on behind
[2327.52 - 2332.14] the scenes their life's a mess
[2329.92 - 2333.82] you scratch the surface
[2332.14 - 2336.54] and it's pretty bad
[2333.82 - 2339.82] but what they show
[2336.54 - 2341.26] on social all the time is a different
[2339.82 - 2343.84] picture
[2341.26 - 2345.10] but what's behind it all isn't really
[2343.84 - 2347.82] what's happening
[2345.10 - 2347.82] in front
[2349.12 - 2352.84] what you don't know that's happening is
[2351.16 - 2355.00] behind the scenes they're in another bad
[2352.84 - 2356.68] relationship you wouldn't know they're
[2355.00 - 2357.94] not going to talk about that part on IG
[2356.68 - 2359.26] or social
[2357.94 - 2360.46] they're not going to talk about that on
[2359.26 - 2361.84] YouTube that they're in another bad
[2360.46 - 2364.30] relationship
[2361.84 - 2365.32] they're going to keep that quiet in the
[2364.30 - 2367.12] back
[2365.32 - 2368.32] or they're experiencing another friend
[2367.12 - 2370.18] betrayal they're not they're going to
[2368.32 - 2372.52] keep that quiet in the back too and when
[2370.18 - 2375.22] they're doing their thing on social
[2372.52 - 2376.78] another career Downer and they're not
[2375.22 - 2377.80] going to talk about that on social but
[2376.78 - 2379.84] they're going to make it look like on
[2377.80 - 2380.98] social debt their career is booming and
[2379.84 - 2383.02] incredible
[2380.98 - 2387.82] but you scratch a surface underneath it
[2383.02 - 2389.86] all their career isn't booming actually
[2387.82 - 2391.60] they make it look like it's booming on
[2389.86 - 2394.18] social they make it look like the
[2391.60 - 2396.28] relationship's going great on social but
[2394.18 - 2397.54] behind the scenes there's problems and
[2396.28 - 2400.02] they're going through a lot of emotional
[2397.54 - 2400.02] turmoil
[2400.42 - 2405.34] they feel like they're drowning again
[2402.52 - 2407.98] stuck at a bad Halloween party again
[2405.34 - 2411.46] falling off the horse again emotionally
[2407.98 - 2414.46] poisoned again we just don't know it
[2411.46 - 2416.92] you don't know it
[2414.46 - 2419.08] some people do go for a little while
[2416.92 - 2421.72] without being challenged
[2419.08 - 2423.94] it's true without too much turmoil
[2421.72 - 2426.70] sometimes many years before a big
[2423.94 - 2428.98] divorce happens or a big life upset
[2426.70 - 2431.32] happens before they get trapped in
[2428.98 - 2433.60] emotional quicksand again
[2431.32 - 2435.10] others have shorter stints of what feels
[2433.60 - 2438.88] like emotional freedom and progress
[2435.10 - 2442.72] either way eventually adversity comes
[2438.88 - 2447.24] adversity comes it just does Christina
[2442.72 - 2447.24] Brad says I feel so validated on YouTube
[2447.28 - 2452.20] and adversity becomes your greatest
[2449.20 - 2455.56] adversary if we don't know what is
[2452.20 - 2458.98] happening inside our emotional brains
[2455.56 - 2460.84] in any moment of time if we don't have
[2458.98 - 2463.18] our brain protected
[2460.84 - 2465.82] the heating that can occur can set us
[2463.18 - 2467.62] back these setbacks can feel very
[2465.82 - 2469.36] confusing when we believe we're taking
[2467.62 - 2471.94] the right steps to our emotional and
[2469.36 - 2473.50] physical health little did we know these
[2471.94 - 2476.08] steps might not have been the most
[2473.50 - 2478.48] appropriate to sustain itself during an
[2476.08 - 2481.42] emotional storm no matter how many
[2478.48 - 2483.88] meditations someone has done or what
[2481.42 - 2485.80] they've conquered emotionally if they're
[2483.88 - 2487.78] not taking care of their brain and
[2485.80 - 2489.64] dealing with their brain heat correctly
[2487.78 - 2492.10] they're not protecting their brain so
[2489.64 - 2493.90] what I'm saying is
[2492.10 - 2495.40] we have to protect our brain because
[2493.90 - 2497.32] we're not going to be able to stop a lot
[2495.40 - 2498.82] of hardships that come our way or other
[2497.32 - 2500.26] things because other people have their
[2498.82 - 2501.94] own free will when you're in a
[2500.26 - 2503.80] relationship the other person has their
[2501.94 - 2506.44] own free will
[2503.80 - 2508.90] they're not beholden to you even though
[2506.44 - 2513.12] it seems like it's like that
[2508.90 - 2513.12] they still have their own free will
[2513.52 - 2518.92] another person in another relationship
[2516.10 - 2521.14] they have their own free will and what
[2518.92 - 2524.56] that means is
[2521.14 - 2526.74] something could go wrong at some point
[2524.56 - 2526.74] foreign
[2528.28 - 2534.10] we can't get worn down by the little ups
[2531.40 - 2536.02] and downs and challenges thrown our way
[2534.10 - 2538.66] we can get worn down by the larger
[2536.02 - 2541.72] challenges that come along every so many
[2538.66 - 2544.84] years whatever life brings whenever it
[2541.72 - 2547.06] brings them our brains burn hot
[2544.84 - 2549.16] being prepared ahead of time is the
[2547.06 - 2550.66] ultimate defense and protection for our
[2549.16 - 2552.64] brain and that's what the brain saver
[2550.66 - 2555.04] books are about and that's what medical
[2552.64 - 2556.54] medium information is about protecting
[2555.04 - 2558.46] the brain where the soul is just
[2556.54 - 2561.04] protecting us
[2558.46 - 2563.20] it allows us to preserve persevere
[2561.04 - 2565.30] through any kind of emotional hit or
[2563.20 - 2566.74] pain or even overwhelming joy we
[2565.30 - 2568.84] experience
[2566.74 - 2570.70] when it comes down to it being aware of
[2568.84 - 2572.74] our emotional brains is not about
[2570.70 - 2574.84] avoiding life's ups and downs because
[2572.74 - 2576.58] whether we like it or not something does
[2574.84 - 2580.66] happen it happens to me it happens to
[2576.58 - 2582.52] everybody we all have something that
[2580.66 - 2584.56] makes us emotional
[2582.52 - 2586.36] it's about learning how to cool the
[2584.56 - 2589.72] brain and keep it
[2586.36 - 2592.18] safe and from being scorched
[2589.72 - 2594.42] guys the information is just incredible
[2592.18 - 2594.42] here
[2598.00 - 2602.02] Cold Light spring says I feel stronger
[2599.98 - 2604.36] with the brain shots we're doing the
[2602.02 - 2606.72] trauma shock and loss stabilizer today
[2604.36 - 2608.98] this is day 12 medic mean brain shot
[2606.72 - 2611.08] therapy cleanse challenge I'm excited
[2608.98 - 2612.34] about this you guys what you see is some
[2611.08 - 2614.86] ingredients in front of me we've got
[2612.34 - 2617.02] apples we've got spinach and we got
[2614.86 - 2619.54] cherries which I'm excited about those
[2617.02 - 2621.76] are frozen cherries that defrost it
[2619.54 - 2626.76] and we're going to make the trauma shock
[2621.76 - 2626.76] and loss stabilizer very excited
[2629.20 - 2634.62] meditation isn't going to stop someone
[2632.32 - 2634.62] else
[2634.72 - 2638.56] from dying
[2636.34 - 2642.12] getting caught in an accident
[2638.56 - 2642.12] it's not going to stop a breakup
[2642.52 - 2646.42] it's not going to stop what happens
[2643.84 - 2648.04] physically to the brain when we have
[2646.42 - 2650.20] betrayal
[2648.04 - 2652.74] because the brain has to be able to
[2650.20 - 2655.20] withstand the Heat
[2652.74 - 2657.58] foreign
[2655.20 - 2659.26] books have a lot of meditations in them
[2657.58 - 2661.06] I mean medical being podcasts at Apple
[2659.26 - 2662.80] podcast incredible meditations from
[2661.06 - 2665.28] Spirit of compassion that help rewire
[2662.80 - 2665.28] the brain
[2665.98 - 2671.44] but we still have to protect our brain
[2668.62 - 2674.86] so when it gets hot
[2671.44 - 2677.62] that it has enough Reserves
[2674.86 - 2681.22] so that's something to keep in mind
[2677.62 - 2682.84] there are physical things we need to do
[2681.22 - 2684.04] for our brain the right amount of
[2682.84 - 2686.14] glucose the right amount of Trace
[2684.04 - 2687.70] mineral salts all of that
[2686.14 - 2690.28] and
[2687.70 - 2692.44] medical meme information is about how we
[2690.28 - 2695.26] can actually fortify
[2692.44 - 2697.42] restore and actually keep the brain
[2695.26 - 2699.16] strong
[2697.42 - 2702.48] Mark crossy says your information is
[2699.16 - 2702.48] restoring my health Anthony
[2706.30 - 2710.50] Adam
[2707.62 - 2712.78] says I did the one yesterday when I got
[2710.50 - 2715.12] some difficult financial news
[2712.78 - 2717.64] it helped me so much these shots work
[2715.12 - 2720.16] like magic thank you so much aw and sfc
[2717.64 - 2722.44] love you so much
[2720.16 - 2725.50] how and why does the brain even heat up
[2722.44 - 2726.58] what does the what does the heat do bad
[2725.50 - 2729.52] or good
[2726.58 - 2732.16] well the bad is that the heat kills
[2729.52 - 2734.14] brain cells and we all know that we
[2732.16 - 2737.02] don't want to lose brain cells at a
[2734.14 - 2738.76] rapid Pace the cleaner the brain cell is
[2737.02 - 2740.80] the greater ability for the brain cell
[2738.76 - 2743.26] to stay alive under Heat
[2740.80 - 2745.48] it takes hotter and more sustained heat
[2743.26 - 2747.52] levels to destroy brain cells when the
[2745.48 - 2749.08] brain cell is clean okay so what that
[2747.52 - 2751.30] means right here
[2749.08 - 2754.00] is if our brain is filled with toxins
[2751.30 - 2756.22] and chemicals and metals and too much of
[2754.00 - 2758.20] that the brain cells get hotter the
[2756.22 - 2761.20] brain gets hotter that means the brain
[2758.20 - 2764.56] cells die easier that's why someone with
[2761.20 - 2766.66] Alzheimer's their brain is dying why is
[2764.56 - 2768.40] their brain dying because they have a
[2766.66 - 2770.44] high level of toxic heavy metals in
[2768.40 - 2772.96] their brain that's mm info
[2770.44 - 2774.82] because the person with Alzheimer's has
[2772.96 - 2777.58] toxic heavy metals in the brain causing
[2774.82 - 2780.10] their their Alzheimer's the brain gets
[2777.58 - 2782.56] hotter and hotter more brain cells die
[2780.10 - 2784.36] faster and faster to the point where
[2782.56 - 2786.10] brain tissue dies and then the person
[2784.36 - 2790.14] with Alzheimer's can't catch up they
[2786.10 - 2790.14] can't get past it they can't beat it
[2791.56 - 2795.46] the cleaner the brain cell is the
[2793.66 - 2796.96] greater ability for the brain cell to
[2795.46 - 2798.82] stay alive under heat that's why it's
[2796.96 - 2800.68] critical to clean the brain cells and
[2798.82 - 2802.72] that's what we're talking about
[2800.68 - 2804.40] it takes hotter and more sustained heat
[2802.72 - 2807.28] levels to destroy a brain cell when it's
[2804.40 - 2809.02] clean when a brain cell is dirty filled
[2807.28 - 2810.82] with everyday toxins and toxic heavy
[2809.02 - 2813.04] metals the brain cell heats up more
[2810.82 - 2814.36] quickly and stays hot longer so what
[2813.04 - 2816.88] happens is like somebody with
[2814.36 - 2817.90] Alzheimer's or dementia is just one
[2816.88 - 2820.48] example
[2817.90 - 2822.82] the brain has so much toxic matter in it
[2820.48 - 2825.04] that when the brain heats up it stays
[2822.82 - 2826.78] hot longer Burns and kills brain cells
[2825.04 - 2829.36] longer
[2826.78 - 2831.34] more toxins make the brain cell more
[2829.36 - 2833.32] conductive to heat plus toxins coat the
[2831.34 - 2835.60] brain cells inner cell membranes not
[2833.32 - 2837.64] allowing heat to escape if a brain cell
[2835.60 - 2840.04] doesn't die the heat can render the
[2837.64 - 2843.88] dirty brain cell out of service
[2840.04 - 2846.88] people walk around with brain cells that
[2843.88 - 2849.64] are where the light is out
[2846.88 - 2852.76] the light is out in the brain cell
[2849.64 - 2855.16] it's out of service the brain cell does
[2852.76 - 2857.80] not respond with electricity
[2855.16 - 2859.60] electricity inside the brain it's out
[2857.80 - 2861.88] the lights are out
[2859.60 - 2864.22] a clean brain cell can release heat more
[2861.88 - 2865.60] easily through its cell wall a dirty one
[2864.22 - 2867.64] can
[2865.60 - 2869.56] that said extended heating over a period
[2867.64 - 2871.54] of time can still render clean brain
[2869.56 - 2873.82] cells temporarily disabled too if we're
[2871.54 - 2876.40] up against a lot of problems forcing it
[2873.82 - 2878.50] to Slumber into dormancy which happens
[2876.40 - 2881.14] to a lot of people
[2878.50 - 2883.72] many times when someone is under extreme
[2881.14 - 2885.58] stress or emotional distress that
[2883.72 - 2888.04] opportunity for brain cells to restore
[2885.58 - 2889.54] doesn't come it's why someone who's
[2888.04 - 2891.34] going through a difficult relationship
[2889.54 - 2893.80] with constant fighting or emotional
[2891.34 - 2896.44] abuse May reach out to an old friend for
[2893.80 - 2899.82] help saying it feels like what I'm going
[2896.44 - 2899.82] through is killing me
[2901.36 - 2906.58] when someone's going through emotional
[2903.28 - 2909.82] torment emotional abuse a difficult
[2906.58 - 2912.52] situation a difficult relationship
[2909.82 - 2916.00] and they tell a friend
[2912.52 - 2918.52] often what they say is
[2916.00 - 2921.70] this is killing me
[2918.52 - 2924.70] this relationship is killing me this
[2921.70 - 2927.30] arguing and fighting is killing me I'm
[2924.70 - 2927.30] dying
[2928.48 - 2932.44] because what they feel like they're
[2930.34 - 2935.14] going through is killing them
[2932.44 - 2937.06] that they feel like they're dying these
[2935.14 - 2940.12] messages aren't just about a soul injury
[2937.06 - 2942.46] someone experiencing from a cycle of
[2940.12 - 2945.22] abuse or a roller coaster ride painful
[2942.46 - 2947.26] relationship of ups and downs this
[2945.22 - 2949.60] person is experiencing brain cells
[2947.26 - 2951.58] themselves shutting down brain cells
[2949.60 - 2953.62] actually shutting down going into
[2951.58 - 2956.10] dormancy with some brain cells even
[2953.62 - 2956.10] dying
[2956.14 - 2961.84] brain cell dormancy and death aren't all
[2959.44 - 2964.30] that happens when the brain heats up
[2961.84 - 2966.40] there's also a diminishing of beneficial
[2964.30 - 2969.28] brain chemicals like neurotransmitter
[2966.40 - 2970.96] chemicals hormones including the
[2969.28 - 2972.88] hundreds of thousands of important brain
[2970.96 - 2974.86] functioning chemicals that surge through
[2972.88 - 2979.02] our brain and remain undiscovered and
[2974.86 - 2979.02] undocumented by research in science
[2980.26 - 2986.68] Health with Liz what's up a debut in
[2983.08 - 2987.76] spirit I I felt so seen when I read this
[2986.68 - 2989.74] chapter
[2987.76 - 2993.28] I used to suffer from that brain heat
[2989.74 - 2995.74] due to metals and other toxins that I
[2993.28 - 2998.92] suffered so much from it I couldn't even
[2995.74 - 3001.68] find peace at the beach
[2998.92 - 3004.38] that's a powerful comment Liz and I have
[3001.68 - 3008.52] to just say something about that
[3004.38 - 3010.80] where like you guys what Liz is saying
[3008.52 - 3012.48] is so powerful and one of the things
[3010.80 - 3014.94] that's really powerful about it is that
[3012.48 - 3018.60] she couldn't find peace at the beach
[3014.94 - 3019.98] that means when she went out of her
[3018.60 - 3023.40] house
[3019.98 - 3026.22] to try to have some type of peace and
[3023.40 - 3027.06] joy and then went to a beach to sit
[3026.22 - 3029.52] there
[3027.06 - 3031.56] she was in agony
[3029.52 - 3033.06] and other people don't understand this
[3031.56 - 3035.64] out there I mean maybe you guys because
[3033.06 - 3037.26] you might experience that but what's
[3035.64 - 3039.12] happening here is that other people in
[3037.26 - 3040.56] the world who have an experience that
[3039.12 - 3041.94] don't know what that is they don't know
[3040.56 - 3043.80] they think that you should be on the
[3041.94 - 3046.74] beach no matter what and you're fine you
[3043.80 - 3049.26] look fine everything should be good but
[3046.74 - 3051.90] instead like
[3049.26 - 3053.58] being on the beach and still suffering
[3051.90 - 3054.90] when you're supposed to be having fun
[3053.58 - 3056.52] right
[3054.90 - 3058.92] it's just really difficult educating
[3056.52 - 3061.08] myself says that's why we're all
[3058.92 - 3063.12] brainwashed
[3061.08 - 3065.04] I think that's what I saw life coaching
[3063.12 - 3068.96] nurse Kim said these brain shots feel
[3065.04 - 3068.96] like they're really cool to my brain
[3073.20 - 3077.46] these chemicals get utilized burned up
[3075.60 - 3079.26] so what I'm saying here in in brain
[3077.46 - 3081.24] saver is that
[3079.26 - 3083.22] the good stuff in our brain gets used up
[3081.24 - 3086.00] and burned up really fast
[3083.22 - 3089.46] when we're up against betrayal anything
[3086.00 - 3091.26] relationships difficult situations if
[3089.46 - 3094.14] our brain is dirty filled with metals
[3091.26 - 3097.08] and toxins all of it
[3094.14 - 3099.78] and IG I have been totally there Liz I
[3097.08 - 3101.52] am better after four years of mm Earth
[3099.78 - 3104.58] humor said that
[3101.52 - 3106.62] and then M Campbell said happens to me
[3104.58 - 3110.78] in the beach as well
[3106.62 - 3110.78] Carol says I experienced that too
[3110.96 - 3115.26] then there are some brain chemicals that
[3113.52 - 3117.30] are there for other reasons of your
[3115.26 - 3120.78] well-being and when the brain gets hot
[3117.30 - 3122.22] these special types of chemicals make it
[3120.78 - 3124.26] hotter for example the chemical
[3122.22 - 3127.26] compounds of the brain involved with
[3124.26 - 3129.48] passion and creativity
[3127.26 - 3131.88] someone has a lot of passion and a lot
[3129.48 - 3134.72] of creativity and their brain is filled
[3131.88 - 3137.82] with a lot of toxins and poisons
[3134.72 - 3140.64] whoa the brain can just burn
[3137.82 - 3142.74] these are invaluable brain chemicals
[3140.64 - 3144.66] the ones that are behind creativity and
[3142.74 - 3146.76] passion that can help us create and get
[3144.66 - 3148.02] inspired express ourselves but when
[3146.76 - 3149.64] we're suffering and we're sick with
[3148.02 - 3151.56] chronic illness we feel like we're dead
[3149.64 - 3153.24] inside
[3151.56 - 3155.22] when we're suffering we're sick with
[3153.24 - 3158.34] chronic illness our passion and our
[3155.22 - 3159.66] creativity gets hindered
[3158.34 - 3162.72] that's what it feels like for a lot of
[3159.66 - 3164.64] people this electrical grid of our brain
[3162.72 - 3166.80] should not be controlled when it comes
[3164.64 - 3168.90] to creativity so these chemicals run
[3166.80 - 3171.06] hotter and our brain ignites and lights
[3168.90 - 3172.98] up because that's something special that
[3171.06 - 3175.08] we have inside
[3172.98 - 3177.66] and explores the benefit of our growth
[3175.08 - 3181.08] this knowledge also explains what's
[3177.66 - 3183.66] behind creative blocks when we feel we
[3181.08 - 3186.60] have a block what does this create a
[3183.66 - 3189.90] block I have why am I stuck
[3186.60 - 3191.94] because of all the toxins
[3189.90 - 3194.34] blocking
[3191.94 - 3196.98] our creativity interfering with the
[3194.34 - 3198.72] creativity chemicals that are good but
[3196.98 - 3201.18] right now yes it's true it doesn't
[3198.72 - 3203.28] matter where you are in fact it's even
[3201.18 - 3206.34] worse when you're somewhere nice and
[3203.28 - 3208.86] still feel bad exactly Lorraine
[3206.34 - 3211.02] by the way on YouTube comment Lorraine
[3208.86 - 3213.00] you left a comment and you put a a time
[3211.02 - 3214.92] time stamp on yesterday's YouTube was
[3213.00 - 3217.44] pretty funny and I hit the time stamp to
[3214.92 - 3219.12] see what part you were talking about
[3217.44 - 3221.66] it was a part where I was cracking up
[3219.12 - 3221.66] about stuff
[3221.70 - 3224.96] I thought that was actually funny
[3229.62 - 3235.14] Elvis lives had a rough rough month my
[3232.86 - 3238.70] creativity songwriting passion went away
[3235.14 - 3238.70] you were so right Anthony
[3243.90 - 3249.78] foreign offering relief is more than
[3246.96 - 3250.80] just trying to offer someone emotional
[3249.78 - 3253.80] comfort
[3250.80 - 3256.62] if someone even has that privilege or
[3253.80 - 3259.02] opportunity to receive solace
[3256.62 - 3262.02] many people don't have someone reaching
[3259.02 - 3265.56] out and offering comfort
[3262.02 - 3267.84] they feel they're in it alone
[3265.56 - 3269.76] so many people feel like they're in it
[3267.84 - 3271.50] alone and that they don't have a lot of
[3269.76 - 3272.94] people reaching out to them or anybody
[3271.50 - 3274.92] reaching out to them to offer them
[3272.94 - 3277.80] Solace or Comfort they feel like they're
[3274.92 - 3280.56] just in it alone
[3277.80 - 3282.60] and even if someone does reach out a
[3280.56 - 3284.22] hand and tells them that everything is
[3282.60 - 3285.90] going to be okay
[3284.22 - 3287.88] doesn't mean they're going to feel that
[3285.90 - 3290.04] comfort
[3287.88 - 3291.96] on Rumble
[3290.04 - 3295.98] see
[3291.96 - 3296.94] JK says I can relate I hurt everywhere I
[3295.98 - 3301.52] go
[3296.94 - 3301.52] I go this all explains a lot
[3303.06 - 3307.68] if I butcher any of your comments just
[3305.22 - 3310.50] just forgive me
[3307.68 - 3313.04] or if I butcher any of your handles just
[3310.50 - 3313.04] forgive me
[3313.32 - 3316.52] I'm not a scholar
[3317.10 - 3321.24] SOC
[3318.54 - 3325.74] has the information on messenger
[3321.24 - 3328.14] I try to message the best I can
[3325.74 - 3330.24] over here verbally doesn't mean they're
[3328.14 - 3331.92] going to feel the Comfort even when
[3330.24 - 3333.48] they're getting Comfort they can still
[3331.92 - 3337.04] feel like they're alone
[3333.48 - 3340.26] when we're in the fire of hurt
[3337.04 - 3341.58] betrayal and anger and distress were in
[3340.26 - 3344.58] the thick of it
[3341.58 - 3346.44] we've been let down our brain may be so
[3344.58 - 3348.18] physically compromised by the heat of
[3346.44 - 3351.62] emotional fire that we're not able to
[3348.18 - 3351.62] see through it with our own eyes
[3351.72 - 3356.22] can't even see through the smoke it's
[3354.36 - 3359.40] hard
[3356.22 - 3363.06] here's a part that's really important
[3359.40 - 3365.46] you're not a bad person
[3363.06 - 3367.92] if we break robot status and express
[3365.46 - 3371.04] emotions such as anger frustration or
[3367.92 - 3372.54] pain we can feel that we come across as
[3371.04 - 3375.30] weak
[3372.54 - 3379.44] the self-help out there tends to lean on
[3375.30 - 3381.66] the side let's change you as a person
[3379.44 - 3384.06] maybe you have some faults
[3381.66 - 3385.62] that we're allowing maybe you have some
[3384.06 - 3388.02] faults that are causing these emotions
[3385.62 - 3390.12] to happen we can make you a better
[3388.02 - 3392.28] person to self-help out there always
[3390.12 - 3393.66] folks focuses on you're really a bad
[3392.28 - 3395.28] person and we're going to make you a
[3393.66 - 3396.90] better person
[3395.28 - 3398.28] since science research doesn't know
[3396.90 - 3400.02] what's wrong with you and no one else
[3398.28 - 3401.94] knows what's wrong with you you
[3400.02 - 3404.76] obviously have just some mental problems
[3401.94 - 3406.80] so you need to work on yourself because
[3404.76 - 3408.90] you're the fault you're the faulty
[3406.80 - 3410.82] person you're a bad person so let's
[3408.90 - 3414.68] change you as a person
[3410.82 - 3414.68] since you're so bad as a person
[3415.26 - 3418.86] we can make you a better person this
[3417.30 - 3420.84] type of self-help tends to point out
[3418.86 - 3422.64] your flaws and imply you're a bad person
[3420.84 - 3423.96] everybody's got flaws I got flaws
[3422.64 - 3425.76] everybody does
[3423.96 - 3429.78] even if it doesn't imply you're a bad
[3425.76 - 3431.64] person it's an approach it's an approach
[3429.78 - 3433.68] that about learning not to react
[3431.64 - 3435.18] learning to think logically learning to
[3433.68 - 3437.10] meditate to control your emotions
[3435.18 - 3439.80] because you can't control the outside
[3437.10 - 3441.30] world so you can control yourself this
[3439.80 - 3443.66] still doesn't address what's physically
[3441.30 - 3443.66] wrong
[3447.38 - 3451.98] self-improvement
[3449.34 - 3454.26] blames us
[3451.98 - 3455.82] as if we're the bad person or the faulty
[3454.26 - 3458.18] person we just don't know how to control
[3455.82 - 3458.18] it
[3458.58 - 3463.08] but really
[3460.44 - 3465.00] no one realized it realizes it in the
[3463.08 - 3466.68] self-improvement world
[3465.00 - 3468.48] that there's really something going on
[3466.68 - 3471.12] we've been really hurt and it happened
[3468.48 - 3473.28] physically not just emotionally
[3471.12 - 3476.22] and we're struggling
[3473.28 - 3478.14] and we're not a bad person it's not your
[3476.22 - 3480.00] fault you didn't even cause your problem
[3478.14 - 3483.68] you were hurt
[3480.00 - 3483.68] so why am I being blamed
[3485.46 - 3489.08] for not handling it right
[3490.44 - 3495.36] any approach that says you're the
[3492.48 - 3497.40] problem can knock a person down slightly
[3495.36 - 3500.82] injure them on top of what they're
[3497.40 - 3503.22] already going through in that hard time
[3500.82 - 3504.42] so here you are you're hurt emotionally
[3503.22 - 3506.10] physically
[3504.42 - 3507.36] you've been through hell and back and
[3506.10 - 3509.88] then someone tells you you're not
[3507.36 - 3511.74] handling it right you're the problem
[3509.88 - 3513.42] it can make them feel like they can't
[3511.74 - 3515.34] handle their emotions you can't handle
[3513.42 - 3517.38] their emotions
[3515.34 - 3518.88] it can even make them feel like they're
[3517.38 - 3520.80] creating their emotional reactions
[3518.88 - 3523.44] you're creating your emotional reactions
[3520.80 - 3526.32] what's never part of the self what's
[3523.44 - 3528.60] never part of this self-help equation is
[3526.32 - 3530.58] telling people that there are toxic
[3528.60 - 3532.56] substances in their brain they've been
[3530.58 - 3535.62] poisoned physically
[3532.56 - 3538.52] on a physical level that's interfering
[3535.62 - 3538.52] with their fire
[3538.92 - 3543.98] they've been hurt this should be the
[3541.32 - 3543.98] main headline
[3544.14 - 3550.56] incredible information you guys

[3969.06 - 3973.44] these are frozen cherries by the way I
[3971.52 - 3978.68] defrosted them
[3973.44 - 3978.68] okay one cup tightly packed spinach next
[3979.14 - 3983.58] drop some spinach in here I got spinach
[3981.66 - 3985.92] on both sides of the cherries there
[3983.58 - 3989.22] let's go
[3985.92 - 3992.88] oh I love this Trace mineral salts in
[3989.22 - 3994.50] the spinach are really incredible too
[3992.88 - 3998.24] coupled with
[3994.50 - 3998.24] the glucose from the cherries
[3998.76 - 4005.24] so one cup tightly packed spinach so I
[4002.54 - 4007.96] still got a little bit more to go
[4005.24 - 4007.96] there we are
[4010.52 - 4012.76] there
[4014.42 - 4019.30] let's get some apple going next you guys
[4016.52 - 4019.30] half an apple
[4021.20 - 4028.12] nice Apple
[4024.08 - 4028.12] I'm gonna cut the Apple in half now
[4030.26 - 4034.16] nice I'm gonna drop some apple pieces in
[4032.84 - 4037.18] here
[4034.16 - 4037.18] I'm excited about
[4038.24 - 4041.08] boom
[4044.42 - 4050.24] so what I love about the trauma shock
[4046.58 - 4052.82] and loss stabilizer is it happens to
[4050.24 - 4055.16] tastes good and I can't say that for
[4052.82 - 4057.86] every one of these brain shots because
[4055.16 - 4060.26] Spirit of compassion wasn't thinking
[4057.86 - 4062.84] about making the brain shot taste good
[4060.26 - 4064.94] good sort of compassion wanted the brain
[4062.84 - 4067.88] shot to actually work
[4064.94 - 4069.80] that was the key and if for some reason
[4067.88 - 4072.02] the right synergistic combination
[4069.80 - 4073.88] happened also taste good at the same
[4072.02 - 4075.92] time then fantastic
[4073.88 - 4078.62] that would be incredible
[4075.92 - 4080.48] and I happen to like this one because it
[4078.62 - 4082.70] tastes good and that's what I love about
[4080.48 - 4085.04] it
[4082.70 - 4087.92] so
[4085.04 - 4090.64] here we go I'm just moving it through my
[4087.92 - 4090.64] screen a little bit
[4092.96 - 4096.98] turn that off
[4094.82 - 4099.20] aha

[4154.70 - 4157.30] so good
[4159.08 - 4164.06] synergistically combined
[4161.66 - 4166.10] no one would know besides the research
[4164.06 - 4167.72] doesn't know that if you put these three
[4166.10 - 4170.24] ingredients together in just the right
[4167.72 - 4172.10] quantities of what it does to rewire the
[4170.24 - 4174.14] brain that information comes from above

[4284.38 - 4291.52] 9899 on IG says that shot is so calming
[4288.14 - 4291.52] and grounding and comforting
[4291.56 - 4296.06] Dr Nesbitt
[4294.50 - 4300.52] um says that they've been having some
[4296.06 - 4300.52] relationship problems again Beatrice
[4300.80 - 4305.72] has been very upset
[4303.98 - 4307.70] with Dr Nesbitt
[4305.72 - 4309.98] ra says that
[4307.70 - 4312.86] she's getting a lot of mental abuse from
[4309.98 - 4315.50] Dr Nesbitt lately because
[4312.86 - 4318.46] of all his bad habits
[4315.50 - 4318.46] uh Beatrice
[4318.94 - 4327.26] so yeah anyway Dr Nesbitt
[4323.54 - 4329.66] um leaves the TV on all night long
[4327.26 - 4332.06] and Beatrice can't sleep
[4329.66 - 4334.22] because the television is on all night
[4332.06 - 4339.20] long Dr Nesbitt that's not a good idea
[4334.22 - 4341.90] that's not helping anything Dr Nesbitt
[4339.20 - 4345.04] um brings his bloody scrubs into the
[4341.90 - 4348.80] house and Beatrice was making a salad
[4345.04 - 4351.32] for Dr Nesbitt
[4348.80 - 4353.66] yeah Beatrice is making a sound for Dr
[4351.32 - 4356.00] Nesbitt and Dr Nesbitt got somebody's
[4353.66 - 4358.64] blood
[4356.00 - 4360.74] in the salad when he was taking off his
[4358.64 - 4364.40] scrubs
[4360.74 - 4366.98] Dr Nesbitt said it was
[4364.40 - 4368.42] it's true it was blood from a surgery he
[4366.98 - 4370.28] was doing
[4368.42 - 4372.98] be interested and appreciate the blood
[4370.28 - 4375.46] on her salad so she had to make a whole
[4372.98 - 4375.46] new salad
[4377.00 - 4382.46] and when she made the whole new salad Dr
[4379.76 - 4385.22] Nesbitt chose not to eat it he went
[4382.46 - 4387.14] straight to his whiskey and did not have
[4385.22 - 4389.72] a salad
[4387.14 - 4392.66] Dr Nesbitt says his Beatrice makes his
[4389.72 - 4396.26] brain heat get real gets really bad
[4392.66 - 4399.20] and Beatrice doesn't appreciate that
[4396.26 - 4400.82] Elizabeth says his brain he got so bad
[4399.20 - 4402.50] from Beatrice that his brain almost
[4400.82 - 4404.84] exploded he said
[4402.50 - 4406.46] and that is not a good thing to say Dr
[4404.84 - 4408.80] Nesbitt how dare you say that about
[4406.46 - 4411.14] Beatrice
[4408.80 - 4414.08] Mitra said
[4411.14 - 4415.46] it's not true Dr nesbit's the one that
[4414.08 - 4416.96] causes all the trouble in the
[4415.46 - 4420.50] relationships

[4420.50 - 4425.06] have
[4421.70 - 4428.42] Dr Nesbitt said
[4425.06 - 4430.64] now when Beatrice nags him
[4428.42 - 4432.50] he feels like
[4430.64 - 4434.78] he the only thing that cools down his
[4432.50 - 4436.04] brain is an extra shot of whiskey at
[4434.78 - 4437.90] night

[4437.90 - 4443.66] I really can't I can't help them what
