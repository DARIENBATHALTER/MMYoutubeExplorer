[1.02 - 6.06] we're talking about the nerve gut acid
[3.66 - 8.40] stabilizer that's what we're making and
[6.06 - 9.84] we're talking about the vagus nerves so
[8.40 - 12.48] even if you're not doing the brain shot
[9.84 - 14.16] therapy right now many of you are we're
[12.48 - 15.54] going into vagus nerves you might want
[14.16 - 17.22] to stick around because it's really
[15.54 - 19.08] powerful information I'm reading it
[17.22 - 21.84] straight out of brain saver right here
[19.08 - 23.82] Vegas nerve information applies to so
[21.84 - 25.26] many people with what's happening in
[23.82 - 26.82] their health a lot of different
[25.26 - 28.86] mysterious symptoms a lot of
[26.82 - 31.38] neurological symptoms connected to the
[28.86 - 34.86] vagus nerves we're going deep into the
[31.38 - 38.34] vagus nerves on this trip okay and we're
[34.86 - 40.56] making the nerve gut acid stabilizer
[38.34 - 43.44] and someone asked yesterday they're like
[40.56 - 44.88] is this alkaline is this alkaline look
[43.44 - 47.58] in front of me right here what do you
[44.88 - 49.68] see you see parsley
[47.58 - 51.84] you see parsley
[49.68 - 54.84] you see cilantro
[51.84 - 55.62] that is alkaline that's alkalinity right
[54.84 - 58.26] there
[55.62 - 59.82] at its best really so anyway we're going
[58.26 - 62.34] into it right now by the way we're day
[59.82 - 63.66] three hello everybody day three of the
[62.34 - 66.18] medical medium brain shot therapy
[63.66 - 68.94] cleanse challenge we're making the nerve
[66.18 - 73.44] gut acid stabilizer which I'm gonna go
[68.94 - 75.36] and find right now let's see page 496
[73.44 - 77.04] and we are going to get there I'm
[75.36 - 78.42] excited about today I got to be honest
[77.04 - 80.10] with you guys
[78.42 - 81.84] I was really looking forward to this
[80.10 - 83.82] right here
[81.84 - 87.00] all right
[83.82 - 88.44] nerve gut acid stabilizer right there
[87.00 - 89.88] check it out
[88.44 - 91.32] that's the one we're doing let's talk
[89.88 - 93.54] about it for a second like why are we
[91.32 - 96.24] even doing this all right let's go
[93.54 - 98.28] use a stabilizing shot
[96.24 - 100.62] if you're looking to strengthen your
[98.28 - 102.66] vagus nerves so if you're actually
[100.62 - 104.16] looking to strengthen those vagus nerves
[102.66 - 105.36] giving people a lot of different
[104.16 - 108.30] problems tightness to the chest
[105.36 - 111.00] tightness of the throat intestinal tract
[108.30 - 112.80] discomfort all of it
[111.00 - 114.90] this shot is really helpful so you're
[112.80 - 117.66] looking to strengthen your vagus nerves
[114.90 - 121.20] use a stabilizing shot
[117.66 - 123.44] if you're dealing with gastric spasms
[121.20 - 126.60] flatulence anybody have flatulence
[123.44 - 129.30] flatulence issues
[126.60 - 132.42] uh chronic gastritis
[129.30 - 135.18] mild acid reflux
[132.42 - 138.36] or other digestive disturbances for
[135.18 - 139.80] acute and reflux relief right see aloe
[138.36 - 141.36] vera shock therapy that's another story
[139.80 - 144.12] but that's incredible there's so many
[141.36 - 147.24] Tools in here it's insane
[144.12 - 149.04] use this shot if you feel your food is
[147.24 - 150.96] not digesting breaking down or
[149.04 - 153.36] assimilating so many people like I'm not
[150.96 - 155.70] assimilating my food I'm not digesting
[153.36 - 157.86] my food I'm not breaking down my food
[155.70 - 160.20] and so what I love about the nerve gut
[157.86 - 162.12] acid stabilizer is it's for that
[160.20 - 163.92] application
[162.12 - 166.44] here's one right here use the
[163.92 - 169.56] stabilizing shock if you feel your poor
[166.44 - 171.72] nutrient absorption
[169.56 - 174.18] so if you feel like you got the poor
[171.72 - 177.68] nutrient absorption use a shot if you've
[174.18 - 181.08] been told you have a microbiome or gut
[177.68 - 182.94] microflora condition or problem
[181.08 - 184.38] so if you've been down the whole Road of
[182.94 - 186.54] hey you got a microbiome problem
[184.38 - 188.04] microflora problem that's what you got
[186.54 - 189.60] you're going in this doctor that doctor
[188.04 - 191.40] whatever bring your bring this to your
[189.60 - 195.18] doctor show them the nerve gut acid
[191.40 - 196.74] stabilizer say doctor can I use this
[195.18 - 198.72] okay
[196.74 - 201.36] also you can use this nerve gut acid
[198.72 - 203.46] stabilizer if you feel as if you're
[201.36 - 207.06] toxic
[203.46 - 208.98] or your blood is toxic
[207.06 - 210.78] so you feel you're toxic or your blood
[208.98 - 214.62] is toxic
[210.78 - 216.96] use this nerve gut acid stabilizer if
[214.62 - 219.30] you feel that your liver and lymph are
[216.96 - 222.54] toxic stagnant and sluggish so your
[219.30 - 225.08] liver lymph or toxic stagnant and
[222.54 - 227.04] sluggish use this
[225.08 - 228.60] stabilizer
[227.04 - 231.38] all right how about this one if you're
[228.60 - 234.36] feeling an acidy stomach
[231.38 - 237.12] acidy Sensations
[234.36 - 239.16] in your throat acidity Sensations in
[237.12 - 241.50] your throat acidity Sensations in your
[239.16 - 243.12] mouth in your stomach or acidity
[241.50 - 246.06] feelings throughout your body where you
[243.12 - 248.88] just feel like you're so acidic you're
[246.06 - 251.22] really acidic realiacity so you can use
[248.88 - 252.78] this nerve gut State acid stabilizer for
[251.22 - 253.62] that
[252.78 - 256.74] foreign
[253.62 - 258.84] use this nerve gut acid stabilizer if
[256.74 - 260.82] you're dealing with chronic nausea or
[258.84 - 263.28] chronic bloating so many people are
[260.82 - 264.72] dealing with all this chronic nausea and
[263.28 - 266.64] chronic bloating where they're all
[264.72 - 269.04] bloated out to here they got the chronic
[266.64 - 273.36] nausea right it's another reason for
[269.04 - 275.76] this incredible acid stabilizer
[273.36 - 278.46] last but not least
[275.76 - 281.04] you're trying to repair acidic body
[278.46 - 282.48] systems and make your body systems more
[281.04 - 283.98] alkaline
[282.48 - 285.66] I love that
[283.98 - 287.94] so you're trying to repair yourself
[285.66 - 290.22] you're trying to repair an acidic
[287.94 - 292.80] environment you're trying to repair an
[290.22 - 294.42] acid environment an acid body
[292.80 - 298.68] and that's what you're up against and
[294.42 - 300.60] you would use this for that
[298.68 - 302.40] all right
[300.60 - 304.98] let's go into this we're hitting page
[302.40 - 306.90] 102. you guys got your books at all if
[304.98 - 309.72] you don't know what book this is this is
[306.90 - 312.42] the brain saver books I'm in brain saver
[309.72 - 315.18] right here I'm in page 102.
[312.42 - 316.38] we will be making the shot later which
[315.18 - 317.64] is going to be really fun but we're
[316.38 - 319.68] going to be talking and discussing about
[317.64 - 321.12] the vagus nerves so check this out this
[319.68 - 324.96] is what we're talking about today page
[321.12 - 326.70] 102 in brain saver I hope you guys
[324.96 - 329.46] um read along I hope you have the book
[326.70 - 332.22] in front of you if not just hang out
[329.46 - 334.74] hang out for the ride relax we're going
[332.22 - 337.62] to talk about your vagus nerves which is
[334.74 - 339.90] actually a really exciting topic
[337.62 - 342.18] all right
[339.90 - 344.94] Catherine Elizabeth
[342.18 - 347.76] says hi YouTube isn't notifying me that
[344.94 - 350.70] you are on surprise surprise surprise of
[347.76 - 353.34] course not I've been kind of like
[350.70 - 354.54] wondering too about that for quite a
[353.34 - 356.22] long time
[354.54 - 358.02] because I don't think they notify
[356.22 - 360.30] everybody but that's pretty much
[358.02 - 362.58] everywhere Carol says what do you mean
[360.30 - 365.52] by toxic blood or whenever we feel like
[362.58 - 369.18] our blood is so toxic we can sense it we
[365.52 - 372.18] have intuitive nature inside of us where
[369.18 - 375.90] we're just feeling like just not
[372.18 - 379.02] you know not like clean inside or
[375.90 - 380.64] feeling acidy and toxic I've written
[379.02 - 383.40] about it in the books this is Liver
[380.64 - 385.38] Rescue dirty blood syndrome so check
[383.40 - 387.48] this out if you have that question look
[385.38 - 390.06] into dirty blood syndrome in here you
[387.48 - 392.64] can learn so much this these books are
[390.06 - 394.56] so packed with information
[392.64 - 396.24] if you don't have these books you might
[394.56 - 398.28] want to get these books Renata vanada
[396.24 - 400.26] says you were the only one who could
[398.28 - 402.36] explain to me what happened to my vagus
[400.26 - 404.70] nerves and finally help me understand
[402.36 - 406.56] the source of my suffering forever
[404.70 - 407.88] grateful and we're not you said vagus
[406.56 - 412.38] nerves
[407.88 - 415.62] with the S exactly we have two vagus
[412.38 - 417.90] nerves not one and I noticed that the
[415.62 - 420.24] people out there in the in in the health
[417.90 - 421.56] World always say one but they act like
[420.24 - 422.76] they know everything about it but they
[421.56 - 426.26] say one when they don't even know
[422.76 - 428.42] there's two we're not at your spot on
[426.26 - 430.92] foreign
[428.42 - 432.24] this shot is slowly giving me my life
[430.92 - 434.46] back
[432.24 - 436.26] see I believe that because I have a
[434.46 - 439.44] friend that's doing this shot right now
[436.26 - 442.08] and I'm watching a friend of mine get
[439.44 - 444.48] their life back so that that's just so
[442.08 - 446.16] powerful and I know this shot works the
[444.48 - 448.50] spirit of compassion is information but
[446.16 - 449.88] it's so it's so incredible all right so
[448.50 - 451.38] let's read about the Vegas Nerfs I'm so
[449.88 - 453.06] glad you guys are commenting I want to
[451.38 - 455.88] read some comments I'm excited about
[453.06 - 457.20] this the special time we're day three of
[455.88 - 459.00] the medical and brain shot therapy
[457.20 - 461.46] cleanse challenge
[459.00 - 463.92] the vagus nerves are made up of tiny
[461.46 - 467.24] strands and strings of nerve cells that
[463.92 - 467.24] run the length of the nerves
[467.76 - 472.80] a vagus nerve is not just one solid
[470.40 - 475.38] nerve
[472.80 - 477.00] yep that's interesting why do I care
[475.38 - 479.46] about that why do I even give a crap
[477.00 - 482.84] about that because the industry thinks
[479.46 - 482.84] it's just one solid nerve
[483.48 - 488.82] I mean it's not it's not one solid nerve
[486.78 - 491.34] a vagus nerve is not just one solid
[488.82 - 492.36] nerve it's a complex weave of nerve
[491.34 - 497.42] cells
[492.36 - 497.42] but it's a weave of nerve cells
[497.76 - 503.28] this is similar to how the other cranial
[499.98 - 506.34] nerves work although not identical
[503.28 - 509.46] this complexity Works in our favor so I
[506.34 - 512.28] want to talk about why vagus nerves this
[509.46 - 514.14] weave construction that they have this
[512.28 - 515.58] weave design that they have why is it
[514.14 - 516.84] beneficial for us if you just got on
[515.58 - 518.16] here we're talking about vagus nerves so
[516.84 - 520.50] what that means is
[518.16 - 523.74] a lot of mystery symptoms burning
[520.50 - 525.92] burning feelings inside everything from
[523.74 - 529.14] like intestinal spasms and cramping
[525.92 - 531.18] gastroparesis to tightness of the chest
[529.14 - 533.28] to anxiety to all kinds of different
[531.18 - 535.08] things the vagus nerves play a huge role
[533.28 - 536.04] I just saw Dr Fond go up over there on
[535.08 - 539.04] IG
[536.04 - 541.20] hello hello glad you're here
[539.04 - 543.84] this complexity Works in our favor when
[541.20 - 545.28] vagus nerve inflammation occurs you guys
[543.84 - 549.38] and that's the big thing right there
[545.28 - 549.38] vagus nerve inflammation
[549.66 - 553.02] the health industry never knew that when
[551.46 - 555.36] vagus nerves are inflamed we have
[553.02 - 556.86] problems
[555.36 - 558.42] I hate sounding like a broken record but
[556.86 - 562.98] it's a medical medium info about Vegas
[558.42 - 565.26] there's becoming inflamed by pathogens
[562.98 - 566.64] and toxins and what that does is it
[565.26 - 568.26] inflames your vagus nerves and the
[566.64 - 570.78] winter vagus nerves get inflamed we get
[568.26 - 573.30] all these symptoms but nobody knew if
[570.78 - 575.58] you were around in this industry looking
[573.30 - 577.08] for help 10 years ago you would have
[575.58 - 579.00] never found that there it just doesn't
[577.08 - 580.32] exist you just get told oh it's all in
[579.00 - 581.76] your head you're crazy or you're not
[580.32 - 585.48] sick or
[581.76 - 588.00] or whatever it's something else
[585.48 - 589.86] when Vegas nerve inflammation occurs it
[588.00 - 592.74] may affect multiple strings within a
[589.86 - 594.18] vagus nerve yet yet yet not every single
[592.74 - 597.96] string of the nerves I want to talk
[594.18 - 601.08] about that so when our vagus nerves okay
[597.96 - 603.30] when our vagus nerves are inflamed it
[601.08 - 605.34] doesn't mean all the strings inside your
[603.30 - 608.06] vagus nerve are inflame and that makes
[605.34 - 610.64] up all the complexities of your pain
[608.06 - 612.66] your stomach gastric pain your
[610.64 - 614.82] gastroparesis your tightness of the
[612.66 - 616.86] chest here your tightness of the abdomen
[614.82 - 618.78] up here you can't take a deep breath
[616.86 - 620.28] down here but you can take a better
[618.78 - 623.82] breath up here
[620.28 - 626.04] it all depends on where the inflammation
[623.82 - 628.08] is on the vagus nerve medical research
[626.04 - 631.20] and science has no idea about this about
[628.08 - 634.50] the complexity about where in the in the
[631.20 - 636.54] vagus nerve is the inflammation or vagus
[634.50 - 638.76] nerves which leads us to one other thing
[636.54 - 642.84] what if you're inflamed in the vagus
[638.76 - 645.06] nerve but not in the other vagus nerve
[642.84 - 647.28] what if you're inflamed in one part of
[645.06 - 649.26] one vagus nerve but inflamed in another
[647.28 - 652.26] part in another Vegas nerve the
[649.26 - 654.30] complexities are insane that's why no
[652.26 - 656.94] one's symptoms are identical it's
[654.30 - 659.52] impossible to have an exact identical
[656.94 - 661.14] symptom even though it sounds identical
[659.52 - 662.40] seems like it it's still going to be a
[661.14 - 663.60] different sensation than somebody
[662.40 - 664.92] because of all these different
[663.60 - 668.96] complexities
[664.92 - 668.96] the very the variables the variations
[669.48 - 674.46] this complexity Works in our favor when
[671.52 - 676.26] Vegas starts inflammation occurs it may
[674.46 - 677.88] affect multiple strings within a vagus
[676.26 - 680.28] there but yet not every string of the
[677.88 - 683.64] nerve which saves our butt
[680.28 - 685.80] it's how we survive if our vagus nerves
[683.64 - 688.08] are inflamed
[685.80 - 691.14] if they're inflamed we can still
[688.08 - 694.44] function many times because only some
[691.14 - 697.50] strings in the vagus nerve are inflamed
[694.44 - 699.06] only some so it makes it so we can
[697.50 - 700.62] function and live our life but even
[699.06 - 701.82] though we feel broken and that we're
[700.62 - 704.64] sick
[701.82 - 706.56] Renata says I feel mine inflamed in
[704.64 - 708.84] multiple different parts due to symptoms
[706.56 - 711.30] is that possible notice that the whole
[708.84 - 715.16] thing so many people have their nerves
[711.30 - 715.16] inflamed in so many different places
[718.50 - 722.88] this means inflammation does not take
[720.60 - 725.58] over an entire vagus nerve because
[722.88 - 729.00] that's how we survive if inflammation
[725.58 - 730.80] takes over your entire vagus nerve then
[729.00 - 732.72] you're going to be in trouble
[730.80 - 735.66] you're really going to have some harsh
[732.72 - 738.66] symptoms but even if that happens
[735.66 - 741.96] there's a chance the other vagus nerve
[738.66 - 744.60] on the other side okay of your the other
[741.96 - 747.96] cranial nerve the vagus nerve is not
[744.60 - 751.76] completely or fully inflamed so this way
[747.96 - 751.76] you're still hanging in there
[753.00 - 757.26] it also means symptoms can move and
[754.98 - 759.06] shift if nerve-strand inflammation moves
[757.26 - 760.44] and shift and that's another thing so
[759.06 - 762.06] many people are like well I had all
[760.44 - 764.16] these symptoms but they're different now
[762.06 - 765.72] had all these symptoms but they're
[764.16 - 768.78] changed
[765.72 - 771.12] I had all these symptoms but they're not
[768.78 - 773.82] the same symptoms but they kind of are
[771.12 - 776.10] the inflammation is changing within the
[773.82 - 779.10] vagus nerves
[776.10 - 781.98] so it's actually changing with the value
[779.10 - 784.08] stirring Sharon says I searched for
[781.98 - 785.82] years for an explanation why I could not
[784.08 - 788.16] take a deep breath
[785.82 - 790.26] teach wow incredible on IG you should re
[788.16 - 793.14] then you must have read this to find out
[790.26 - 795.84] why the information is so so intense
[793.14 - 798.24] Health with Liz good to see you on IG
[795.84 - 800.40] I've been doing this brain shot for the
[798.24 - 802.86] past three days and it's gotten rid of
[800.40 - 804.84] my acidy Sensations I have to tell you
[802.86 - 807.66] this brain shot
[804.84 - 810.56] right whether you do all cilantro as an
[807.66 - 813.72] option or all parsley is
[810.56 - 816.06] unbelievable unbelievable
[813.72 - 817.98] while blueberry dreams I have multiple
[816.06 - 820.86] sclerosis and medical medium information
[817.98 - 823.38] is helping me restore my nerves I was
[820.86 - 825.54] going to have a shoulder surgery and
[823.38 - 827.88] turns out I didn't even need to have it
[825.54 - 829.74] so thankful I didn't go through with it
[827.88 - 833.16] oh God bless you amazing that you're
[829.74 - 834.60] doing so much better I'm so so happy for
[833.16 - 837.12] you
[834.60 - 840.30] I really am
[837.12 - 843.54] Susan Blondo says love that informed us
[840.30 - 846.48] love that informed us about our two
[843.54 - 849.24] vagus nerves learn so much from you you
[846.48 - 851.40] are a great teacher thank you thank you
[849.24 - 853.92] I try to message the information
[851.40 - 857.16] the spirit of compassion
[853.92 - 860.46] and knowing about these two nerves is
[857.16 - 862.20] critical so I am a messenger and happy
[860.46 - 864.48] to message
[862.20 - 866.88] okay
[864.48 - 869.40] it also means symptoms can move and
[866.88 - 870.30] shift if nerves Rand inflammation moves
[869.40 - 872.46] and shift
[870.30 - 874.80] if the cause of inflammation is
[872.46 - 877.74] aggressive
[874.80 - 879.42] inflammation can breach onto other nerve
[877.74 - 881.88] strands so if you've got some really
[879.42 - 886.26] intense inflammation in the vagus nerves
[881.88 - 889.20] okay it can breach into other strands
[886.26 - 890.22] inside of the vagus nerve signs of
[889.20 - 892.80] research doesn't have any of this
[890.22 - 894.36] information about any of that about how
[892.80 - 896.84] inflammation works in the vase nerve
[894.36 - 898.74] this is this is literally groundbreaking
[896.84 - 901.14] life-changing information that doesn't
[898.74 - 905.16] exist out there
[901.14 - 908.64] let's see Spirit filleted kitchen says I
[905.16 - 910.62] always knew it was my vagus nerve didn't
[908.64 - 912.00] know it was nerves I was researching and
[910.62 - 916.64] researching about
[912.00 - 916.64] you're the only one who knew this
[920.46 - 923.52] so let's keep on going a little bit more
[922.02 - 925.80] you guys if you just got here we're
[923.52 - 928.68] going to be making the nerve acid but
[925.80 - 929.94] the nerve gut acid stabilizer it's an
[928.68 - 934.32] insane
[929.94 - 935.82] brain shot therapy it's incredible I'm
[934.32 - 937.38] just really pumped up about it I've been
[935.82 - 939.48] telling people about Vegas nerves so
[937.38 - 940.74] what symptoms are caused for over 35
[939.48 - 945.12] years
[940.74 - 948.66] was called the vagus nerve guy years ago
[945.12 - 951.00] just like us called the Epstein-Barr guy
[948.66 - 952.74] guess what it was called the zinc guy
[951.00 - 955.92] which is why everybody's like zinc Zing
[952.74 - 958.26] for everything now hooting C
[955.92 - 961.38] and the whole bit Wild Heart kitchen
[958.26 - 964.92] says I'm a naturopathic practitioner
[961.38 - 966.84] cool and am learning so much from you a
[964.92 - 969.84] lot which blows what I've been taught
[966.84 - 972.06] out of the water I love it incredible so
[969.84 - 974.04] so wild heart do you have the brain
[972.06 - 975.90] saver books do you have liberal rescue
[974.04 - 979.02] do you have cleansed to heal the
[975.90 - 980.04] information blows my mind every day it
[979.02 - 981.90] just does
[980.04 - 983.40] and thank you for actually reading the
[981.90 - 985.68] books and learning
[983.40 - 989.10] France's family chef says I did this
[985.68 - 992.34] with all parsley had the family take it
[989.10 - 994.80] too helped with more than I could say
[992.34 - 996.72] it's it's probably one of my favorites
[994.80 - 999.90] favorites but there's so many medical
[996.72 - 1002.06] medium tools that blow my mind and offer
[999.90 - 1004.04] so much relief and so much movement
[1002.06 - 1005.66] forward for people it's hard to say
[1004.04 - 1007.88] which ones are my favorite it's just
[1005.66 - 1011.24] hard I mean
[1007.88 - 1014.06] heavy metal detox movie is insane the
[1011.24 - 1016.22] cleanses are insane the monocleanse the
[1014.06 - 1018.20] whatever 369 that nerve gut acid
[1016.22 - 1019.70] stabilizer like all of it but we're
[1018.20 - 1020.90] doing brain shot therapy so I'm not
[1019.70 - 1023.12] going to get carried away with myself
[1020.90 - 1024.80] right now
[1023.12 - 1027.14] game
[1024.80 - 1028.16] if the nerve strand inflammation moves
[1027.14 - 1029.84] and shifts you guys we're talking about
[1028.16 - 1032.00] nerve strands inside your vagus nerves
[1029.84 - 1034.16] being becoming inflamed
[1032.00 - 1036.74] if the cause of inflammation is
[1034.16 - 1039.14] aggressive inflammation can breach onto
[1036.74 - 1041.42] other nerve strands where inflammation
[1039.14 - 1043.52] can go up and down
[1041.42 - 1045.38] slightly pressuring
[1043.52 - 1047.42] pressurizing and pushing different
[1045.38 - 1050.38] strands of nerve cells within an area of
[1047.42 - 1052.58] a vagus nerve leading to Milder
[1050.38 - 1054.44] phantom-like symptoms that come and go
[1052.58 - 1056.68] so someone could be like why is my
[1054.44 - 1060.44] symptoms moving around
[1056.68 - 1061.88] why are my symptoms moving around
[1060.44 - 1064.28] why
[1061.88 - 1068.00] I'm telling a doctor it's kind of here
[1064.28 - 1070.22] now it's kind of here
[1068.00 - 1074.02] I'm telling my doctor it's kind of here
[1070.22 - 1074.02] but now it's kind of here
[1074.12 - 1078.56] telling my doctor it's kind of here now
[1076.70 - 1081.26] it's kind of here
[1078.56 - 1083.96] but now it's both but now it's not
[1081.26 - 1086.78] anymore it's kind of here
[1083.96 - 1088.40] vegaser of inflammation strands becoming
[1086.78 - 1091.40] inflamed
[1088.40 - 1093.68] inside the vagus nerves and moving the
[1091.40 - 1095.72] symptoms around the sensations and the
[1093.68 - 1098.08] feelings you're feeling moving them
[1095.72 - 1098.08] around
[1098.30 - 1103.04] this makes a lot of people feel crazy
[1100.34 - 1104.72] have your vagus nerves symptoms ever
[1103.04 - 1107.72] made you feel like you're losing your
[1104.72 - 1111.02] mind I just I just want to ask you guys

[1135.92 - 1139.40] what I mean where I'm making fun of like
[1137.42 - 1142.00] the doctor that buys the vineyard in
[1139.40 - 1142.00] Napa Valley
[1142.04 - 1145.46] and I make fun of doctors and all the
[1144.32 - 1148.04] way it doesn't mean I don't have respect
[1145.46 - 1151.18] for doctors Dr Alejandra younger an
[1148.04 - 1153.44] amazing doctor incredible medical doctor
[1151.18 - 1155.78] you know wrote the forward on the on
[1153.44 - 1158.06] these brain saver books
[1155.78 - 1159.20] it's you know the point I'm trying to
[1158.06 - 1162.20] say is
[1159.20 - 1164.66] um definitely honored you're here I talk
[1162.20 - 1166.16] to doctors a lot
[1164.66 - 1168.62] for years
[1166.16 - 1172.66] providing information
[1168.62 - 1172.66] for their very difficult cases
[1173.36 - 1178.34] all right still these Phantom symptoms
[1175.64 - 1180.74] any person's
[1178.34 - 1182.84] and a person's main more definable
[1180.74 - 1184.82] symptoms are less severe than they would
[1182.84 - 1186.74] be if inflammation were taking over the
[1184.82 - 1188.48] entire nerve and creating more severe
[1186.74 - 1189.68] symptoms that would complicate someone's
[1188.48 - 1192.86] suffering further so what I'm trying to
[1189.68 - 1193.82] say is your vagus nerves you got two of
[1192.86 - 1196.10] them
[1193.82 - 1197.84] both can be slightly inflamed in
[1196.10 - 1198.74] different nerve strands inside the vagus
[1197.84 - 1200.96] nerves
[1198.74 - 1203.60] you can be getting Sensations everywhere
[1200.96 - 1209.30] you can be the most confusing patient to
[1203.60 - 1211.82] a doctor really confusing burning skin
[1209.30 - 1213.92] twitches and spasms
[1211.82 - 1216.20] tightness in the chest you can have the
[1213.92 - 1218.18] vagus nerves inflamed in all various
[1216.20 - 1220.52] areas and then feeling like you can't
[1218.18 - 1222.32] digest your food at all feeling like you
[1220.52 - 1224.54] can't digest anymore could even be
[1222.32 - 1226.46] involved
[1224.54 - 1229.58] The Details Matter
[1226.46 - 1232.58] all these details can give you peace of
[1229.58 - 1235.64] mind as you are confused and going to
[1232.58 - 1237.62] your 10th Doctor neurologist this is
[1235.64 - 1239.30] information brain care doctor the point
[1237.62 - 1241.40] is is it brings peace of mind because
[1239.30 - 1242.72] when we don't know what's wrong and we
[1241.40 - 1244.58] had everything checked out and
[1242.72 - 1247.34] everything looks okay but we don't have
[1244.58 - 1251.32] an answer having an answer is a huge
[1247.34 - 1251.32] relief it's a big deal
[1252.32 - 1256.46] that's the difference between medical
[1253.70 - 1259.40] medium and everything else you can get
[1256.46 - 1261.02] out there the details are in here about
[1259.40 - 1262.70] it so if you hear about Vegas nerve out
[1261.02 - 1264.08] there you can't get the details about it
[1262.70 - 1265.28] all
[1264.08 - 1266.96] you can't learn about the different
[1265.28 - 1268.64] strands but not just that the different
[1266.96 - 1271.34] symptoms involved and not just that
[1268.64 - 1273.02] what's inflaming the vagus nerves heck
[1271.34 - 1275.00] that's the most important piece of it
[1273.02 - 1277.34] what's in flaming your vagus nerves
[1275.00 - 1279.38] answers and details on how and why to
[1277.34 - 1281.54] heal your vagus nerves that's the other
[1279.38 - 1282.98] point
[1281.54 - 1285.26] kind of getting carried away I'm getting
[1282.98 - 1286.82] ready for my nerve gut acid stabilizer
[1285.26 - 1290.78] matter of fact
[1286.82 - 1292.40] Elvis lives I really liked Elvis and I
[1290.78 - 1294.92] like Elvis's music so that's pretty cool
[1292.40 - 1297.32] Elvis lives this explains so much my
[1294.92 - 1299.06] strange nerve Sensations move around too
[1297.32 - 1301.88] so your strange nerve Sensations are
[1299.06 - 1303.86] actually moving around
[1301.88 - 1306.92] yes that's how it works it explains it
[1303.86 - 1308.90] lupus free with celery33 I used to choke
[1306.92 - 1310.52] on food easily until I started medical
[1308.90 - 1313.22] meaning protocols which means you were
[1310.52 - 1315.38] healing the vagus nerves you were
[1313.22 - 1317.06] healing the cranial nerves that's what
[1315.38 - 1319.54] you were doing using medical medium was
[1317.06 - 1323.00] healing the vagus nerves
[1319.54 - 1325.52] endocranial nerves
[1323.00 - 1328.00] anybody watching this take the books to
[1325.52 - 1328.00] your doctors
[1329.72 - 1335.18] pray daily says I feel I'm still alive
[1332.06 - 1338.72] because of you and compassionate spirit
[1335.18 - 1341.00] compassionate Spirit indeed
[1338.72 - 1343.82] I try my best throughout my life to be
[1341.00 - 1345.98] as compassion as possible
[1343.82 - 1348.44] and any way I possibly can because I do
[1345.98 - 1350.24] know one thing that when you're sick and
[1348.44 - 1351.92] you're down and you're suffering and
[1350.24 - 1353.66] don't have an answer and you tried
[1351.92 - 1355.28] everything and you feel like you're
[1353.66 - 1360.20] losing hope
[1355.28 - 1363.02] it is hell and then some and what I do
[1360.20 - 1364.64] is I think about that I think about what
[1363.02 - 1366.56] it's like to be in your shoes if you
[1364.64 - 1368.96] have all these symptoms that means
[1366.56 - 1370.58] you're suffering if you are struggling
[1368.96 - 1373.58] and don't have an answer and you feel
[1370.58 - 1376.58] these symptoms I have to realize and I
[1373.58 - 1379.22] have in my life that if I try to really
[1376.58 - 1380.90] connect with that and say Anthony
[1379.22 - 1383.12] aw
[1380.90 - 1384.86] you're not sick you don't have those
[1383.12 - 1386.30] symptoms
[1384.86 - 1390.38] but
[1386.30 - 1392.72] what if you did feel those symptoms
[1390.38 - 1395.08] now connect to that person psychically
[1392.72 - 1396.98] connect to that person
[1395.08 - 1398.84] telepathically
[1396.98 - 1400.76] you know connect to that person listen
[1398.84 - 1403.94] to Spirit of compassion on how bad that
[1400.76 - 1406.10] person's suffering and
[1403.94 - 1409.10] connect with that
[1406.10 - 1411.98] and feel that and what would it be like
[1409.10 - 1413.06] in their shoes and when I think about
[1411.98 - 1416.66] that
[1413.06 - 1418.76] and I feel that it's like
[1416.66 - 1420.56] you you could see everything you know
[1418.76 - 1423.08] especially if you're psychic right you
[1420.56 - 1425.00] could see everything you can see
[1423.08 - 1426.62] the phone calls they always have to make
[1425.00 - 1428.90] how they're not well enough to get out
[1426.62 - 1430.70] of bed how they're always like they need
[1428.90 - 1433.10] help how they need help they need people
[1430.70 - 1437.72] to bring them food how like
[1433.10 - 1440.00] how nobody believes them around them how
[1437.72 - 1441.80] they're they they hate themselves for
[1440.00 - 1444.92] having these symptoms like I feel it all
[1441.80 - 1446.78] and I understand it all and and I'm just
[1444.92 - 1449.32] scratching the surface
[1446.78 - 1449.32] all right
[1451.58 - 1457.04] because of the vagus nerves size and
[1454.04 - 1459.02] reach when inflammation occurs in the
[1457.04 - 1461.68] brain stem that affects the vagus nerve
[1459.02 - 1461.68] Grapevine
[1462.02 - 1467.60] the vagus nerves can exhibit a wider
[1465.02 - 1470.12] range of symptoms on the whole than
[1467.60 - 1473.72] other cranial nerves so what this is is
[1470.12 - 1475.34] this is a medical textbook right and I'm
[1473.72 - 1478.16] just a human being like everybody else
[1475.34 - 1480.38] I'm not a doctor
[1478.16 - 1482.36] but I have to take the information word
[1480.38 - 1484.28] for word doesn't matter how complicated
[1482.36 - 1485.84] it is it doesn't matter
[1484.28 - 1487.46] how it works I have to take a word from
[1485.84 - 1488.78] a word from above to get it in here and
[1487.46 - 1491.24] then I have to learn it just like
[1488.78 - 1492.80] everybody else someone made fun of me
[1491.24 - 1494.42] a couple weeks ago and it was a couple
[1492.80 - 1495.80] weeks ago or a few weeks ago I saw it on
[1494.42 - 1497.48] social media and they made fun of me and
[1495.80 - 1499.16] they said the guy doesn't even know his
[1497.48 - 1501.86] own information are you kidding this
[1499.16 - 1504.50] eight eight huge medical books with
[1501.86 - 1505.82] complicated detailed information I'm
[1504.50 - 1507.86] only human
[1505.82 - 1509.72] I have to learn it like everybody else
[1507.86 - 1511.52] who gets the book If you go to the
[1509.72 - 1512.78] library or buy the book somewhere and
[1511.52 - 1514.16] get the book from the library and you
[1512.78 - 1516.62] have the book in your hand you have to
[1514.16 - 1518.66] learn this information I had to learn it
[1516.62 - 1520.16] writing it down I still have to learn it
[1518.66 - 1521.00] every day someone was making fun of me
[1520.16 - 1523.00] like
[1521.00 - 1525.38] he doesn't even know his information
[1523.00 - 1527.78] when he reads it you should see it's
[1525.38 - 1531.14] like are you kidding me
[1527.78 - 1533.84] eight volumes of medical medical books
[1531.14 - 1535.34] and detailed information yeah I have to
[1533.84 - 1538.96] study it
[1535.34 - 1538.96] yeah I have to read it
[1540.62 - 1545.42] brain saver and brain saver Protocols
[1542.72 - 1547.88] are two huge books they were written as
[1545.42 - 1550.16] one book Health authors do not do that
[1547.88 - 1553.10] they were released at the same time and
[1550.16 - 1556.00] written over a year ago
[1553.10 - 1559.10] okay mostly written in one year
[1556.00 - 1561.68] basically and we had to split it in half
[1559.10 - 1563.54] because the publisher said there's no
[1561.68 - 1566.00] way to put anything out like this so I'm
[1563.54 - 1567.50] just saying
[1566.00 - 1569.12] right
[1567.50 - 1570.26] you guys were talking about Vegas serves
[1569.12 - 1574.06] let's get back to that and I want to
[1570.26 - 1574.06] make this nerve good acid stabilizer
[1575.06 - 1579.28] when inflammation occurs in the brain
[1576.98 - 1579.28] stem
[1581.84 - 1586.64] then we get in trouble if somebody has
[1584.00 - 1589.34] brain stem inflammation it can affect
[1586.64 - 1591.86] the vagus nerves or one of the vagus
[1589.34 - 1594.86] nerves in a different way than just if
[1591.86 - 1597.68] the vagus nerve itself was inflamed a
[1594.86 - 1600.08] lot of people have brain stem vagus
[1597.68 - 1602.54] nerve inflammation you don't hear that
[1600.08 - 1604.28] out there anywhere but it's but it's
[1602.54 - 1607.04] incredible when you think about this
[1604.28 - 1609.38] information these Vegas nerve symptoms
[1607.04 - 1612.68] okay
[1609.38 - 1615.38] can result from an inflamed brain stem
[1612.68 - 1617.30] and that could be like not just
[1615.38 - 1621.62] tightness of the chest
[1617.30 - 1623.66] not just a gut pain or spasm
[1621.62 - 1626.72] but you can have like or you feel like
[1623.66 - 1629.06] you can't even breathe you can't swallow
[1626.72 - 1631.70] you're getting ticks and spasms
[1629.06 - 1634.52] everywhere I mean you can have
[1631.70 - 1638.44] brain stem
[1634.52 - 1638.44] vagus nerves inflammation
[1639.20 - 1643.16] these vagus nerve symptoms that result
[1641.30 - 1644.72] from an inflamed brain stem could
[1643.16 - 1646.28] include tightness of the chest tightness
[1644.72 - 1648.86] of the throat mild dizziness and
[1646.28 - 1651.08] imbalance to feeling an imbalanced
[1648.86 - 1653.50] feeling like you know like you're on a
[1651.08 - 1657.08] boat that whole thing
[1653.50 - 1659.78] vagus nerve inflammation closer to the
[1657.08 - 1662.54] brain stem giving you that boat feeling
[1659.78 - 1664.28] that vertigo feeling as well as anxiety
[1662.54 - 1666.44] pressure in the chest do you ever feel
[1664.28 - 1668.96] you get pressure in the chest difficulty
[1666.44 - 1671.12] swallowing even if mild a hard time
[1668.96 - 1674.00] taking a deep breath can't keep a deep
[1671.12 - 1676.58] breath can't get a deep breath
[1674.00 - 1678.62] pain in the throat nausea and sometimes
[1676.58 - 1680.24] erratic heartbeat where the doctor
[1678.62 - 1681.92] checks out fine you wore the heart
[1680.24 - 1683.00] monitor and the doctor checks out fine
[1681.92 - 1685.04] if you guys just got here we're talking
[1683.00 - 1688.00] about Vegas and you've got the heartbeat
[1685.04 - 1688.00] erratic heartbeat
[1688.52 - 1690.70] foreign
[1692.08 - 1698.66] is stemming from higher up like this
[1695.00 - 1703.60] ready higher up in the brain stem when
[1698.66 - 1703.60] when vagus nerve inflammation
[1705.44 - 1710.50] Tire up
[1707.42 - 1710.50] in the brain stem
[1710.54 - 1716.24] we could have a lot of symptoms mukto
[1713.30 - 1718.52] says show please where are the two vagus
[1716.24 - 1720.32] nerves they come right out of brain stem
[1718.52 - 1722.06] the brain stems back here in this little
[1720.32 - 1726.56] brain right here
[1722.06 - 1729.26] and down in here and down in here
[1726.56 - 1731.90] so it's and what they do is they come
[1729.26 - 1735.02] out of the brain stem
[1731.90 - 1736.88] right the cranial nerves come out
[1735.02 - 1739.40] and they ride down
[1736.88 - 1743.26] and they cross and I want to read about
[1739.40 - 1743.26] that because it's really incredible
[1744.74 - 1748.88] your vagus nerves
[1746.90 - 1751.60] have a lot of little nerves that reach
[1748.88 - 1754.16] out and attach to areas
[1751.60 - 1756.92] intestinal tract
[1754.16 - 1758.96] the gut stomach
[1756.92 - 1760.52] a lot of people lose peristaltic action
[1758.96 - 1764.02] they get gastroparesis because their
[1760.52 - 1764.02] vagus nerve is paralyzed
[1766.96 - 1771.44] you can have mild dizziness imbalance
[1769.52 - 1773.96] feeling a sense of not digesting well
[1771.44 - 1776.60] anxiety pressure in the chest difficulty
[1773.96 - 1778.40] swallowing even if mild a hard time
[1776.60 - 1780.50] taking a deep breath pain in the throat
[1778.40 - 1783.68] nausea and sometimes erratic heartbeat
[1780.50 - 1786.20] when vagus nerve inflammation is
[1783.68 - 1788.66] stemming from higher up like this higher
[1786.20 - 1790.94] up it's not stemming from here it's
[1788.66 - 1793.22] stemming from up here okay in your brain
[1790.94 - 1795.14] stem from the brain stem itself it could
[1793.22 - 1796.76] be a little bit of everything there's
[1795.14 - 1798.38] people that have a little bit of
[1796.76 - 1800.84] everything and they're like why do I
[1798.38 - 1802.46] have every symptom there's people that
[1800.84 - 1805.78] feel like they have a hundred symptoms
[1802.46 - 1805.78] to the do you have 100 symptoms
[1806.56 - 1812.38] Maria says I was on a boat for years
[1808.88 - 1812.38] thank you aw not anymore
[1814.76 - 1818.96] I see your comments on YouTube Maria
[1817.04 - 1820.70] people asking about tinnitus there's a
[1818.96 - 1822.86] detailed explanation the brain saver
[1820.70 - 1824.48] protocols book about tinnitus and in the
[1822.86 - 1827.30] brain saver book these two books you
[1824.48 - 1830.06] want both I recommend getting both not
[1827.30 - 1831.38] just one if you only have one get the
[1830.06 - 1833.06] other
[1831.38 - 1835.64] if you don't have money even though it's
[1833.06 - 1838.04] on sale at amazon.com like a sick sale
[1835.64 - 1839.48] like it's incredible on these two books
[1838.04 - 1841.10] if you don't have the money go to the
[1839.48 - 1842.66] library and get it for free
[1841.10 - 1844.70] please
[1842.66 - 1846.38] it's okay I don't mind I just want you
[1844.70 - 1849.08] to have it in your hands
[1846.38 - 1850.70] one possible experience is neurological
[1849.08 - 1851.96] asthma so I want to talk about that a
[1850.70 - 1854.00] little bit there's there's a difference
[1851.96 - 1857.80] between your bronchial
[1854.00 - 1857.80] tubes being inflamed
[1857.90 - 1862.76] there's a difference between your
[1859.46 - 1864.58] bronchial Airway being inflamed
[1862.76 - 1867.20] versus
[1864.58 - 1868.04] neurological asthma
[1867.20 - 1870.20] um
[1868.04 - 1871.82] I can't tell you over the years how many
[1870.20 - 1873.80] times I've seen pulmonologists totally
[1871.82 - 1876.86] confused by this
[1873.80 - 1879.74] the person's doing a pulmonary test
[1876.86 - 1882.44] they're breathing in the pipe
[1879.74 - 1884.66] and then the pulmonologist says wait a
[1882.44 - 1886.52] minute you don't have asthma but you
[1884.66 - 1887.90] you're acting like you have asthma
[1886.52 - 1890.26] you're acting like you have a breathing
[1887.90 - 1890.26] problem
[1890.72 - 1895.76] in a pulmonologist
[1893.18 - 1898.40] doesn't know what to do
[1895.76 - 1899.90] so they give you all the steroids
[1898.40 - 1901.58] they give you all the medications they
[1899.90 - 1903.86] give you the albuterol they give you all
[1901.58 - 1907.96] of that and they're hoping that it helps
[1903.86 - 1911.00] but yet your bronchial Airways are not
[1907.96 - 1915.46] constricted there isn't an actual
[1911.00 - 1915.46] blockage from them swelling
[1915.74 - 1920.12] so then where do we go what do we do
[1918.14 - 1922.82] millions of people on this planet I've
[1920.12 - 1925.76] seen so many that have had neurological
[1922.82 - 1928.64] asthma which is a term a medical medium
[1925.76 - 1929.42] term nobody knew that that existed like
[1928.64 - 1931.76] that
[1929.42 - 1934.52] so a possible experience is neurological
[1931.76 - 1937.64] asthma ready a form of asthma where the
[1934.52 - 1939.86] Airways are not impeded by visible
[1937.64 - 1943.22] inflammation at the pulmonologist's
[1939.86 - 1945.86] office instead neurological asthma is
[1943.22 - 1948.92] the sensation of air restriction created
[1945.86 - 1953.98] by inflamed vagus nerves it's the
[1948.92 - 1953.98] sensation of Airway obstruction
[1955.46 - 1959.42] Elvis lives said this is perfectly
[1957.68 - 1961.76] explaining the difficulties I've been
[1959.42 - 1964.10] having for the last 20 years never heard
[1961.76 - 1965.96] anything that so perfectly describes all
[1964.10 - 1968.18] of it it's very emotional incredible
[1965.96 - 1970.58] Elvis lives I'm honored you're here
[1968.18 - 1973.46] that's why I
[1970.58 - 1976.22] try to help and get this information out
[1973.46 - 1979.22] I pray to God every night
[1976.22 - 1981.82] that someone finds their way and they
[1979.22 - 1981.82] find this information
[1986.30 - 1989.62] gets me emotional
[1990.26 - 1993.88] Shake It Off Shake It Off
[1994.94 - 2001.44] get reading get reading
[1997.34 - 2001.44] Spirit of compassion said keep reading
[2003.48 - 2009.00] we got work to do
[2006.52 - 2009.00] okay
[2009.40 - 2014.20] and by the way we understand
[2011.62 - 2015.46] your pain with all of that
[2014.20 - 2017.02] so what I was talking about the
[2015.46 - 2018.34] neurological asthma which is a big deal
[2017.02 - 2019.78] and I want you to know this and I've
[2018.34 - 2021.82] taught doctors about this throughout the
[2019.78 - 2023.50] years when this when the bronchial tubes
[2021.82 - 2025.54] are not obstructed whatsoever on any
[2023.50 - 2027.16] level they're not inflamed where there's
[2025.54 - 2029.44] an actual obstruction and they can't get
[2027.16 - 2031.36] the ear in instead they have a
[2029.44 - 2032.86] neurological problem the vagus nerves
[2031.36 - 2034.66] are inflamed and when the vagus nerves
[2032.86 - 2037.42] are inflamed they're getting a slight
[2034.66 - 2039.58] sensation of paralysis that doesn't even
[2037.42 - 2041.50] feel like air is even going in so you're
[2039.58 - 2043.30] stuck you just don't know what to do and
[2041.50 - 2045.64] then you get anxiety attacks and then
[2043.30 - 2047.44] you hyperventilate that's neurological
[2045.64 - 2049.00] asthma and you can go to a whole bunch
[2047.44 - 2050.26] of pulmonologists they don't know what's
[2049.00 - 2051.70] wrong and then you're back to another
[2050.26 - 2052.90] neurologist and everybody else and
[2051.70 - 2054.64] they're just like I don't know what to
[2052.90 - 2056.08] tell you I think you have anxiety maybe
[2054.64 - 2058.48] you should take some Xanax and that's
[2056.08 - 2061.18] what they tell people where benzo or
[2058.48 - 2063.36] some other benzo or something
[2061.18 - 2063.36] foreign
[2063.40 - 2069.30] as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the
[2065.98 - 2072.10] brain stem whoa what did I just said say
[2069.30 - 2074.14] as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the
[2072.10 - 2075.82] burning stem
[2074.14 - 2079.06] in
[2075.82 - 2081.82] oh yeah yep for mild to more severe some
[2079.06 - 2084.04] of the inflammation will lessen or
[2081.82 - 2085.36] intensify on the vagus dirt Grapevine so
[2084.04 - 2086.80] this is what's really interesting right
[2085.36 - 2088.42] here
[2086.80 - 2090.46] because I'm having a conversation with
[2088.42 - 2092.74] SOC at the same time I'm trying to read
[2090.46 - 2094.30] comments and and be present for you guys
[2092.74 - 2096.06] at the same time I'm trying to read this
[2094.30 - 2099.16] this complexity
[2096.06 - 2101.38] this medical Bible right here
[2099.16 - 2104.76] Susan horn says I feel like crying too
[2101.38 - 2104.76] finally I got answers
[2106.30 - 2109.84] we should all cry together I want to sit
[2108.16 - 2111.34] down and all this cry together life
[2109.84 - 2114.72] coaching nurse Kim says tears of
[2111.34 - 2114.72] gratitude right now thank you aw
[2116.02 - 2120.16] so as this inflammation I'm talking
[2117.88 - 2122.14] about Ebbs and flows in the brain stem
[2120.16 - 2124.84] which I was saying before like the brain
[2122.14 - 2126.76] stem right from mild to more severe for
[2124.84 - 2128.50] some people some of the inflammation
[2126.76 - 2130.42] will lessen or intensify on the Vegas
[2128.50 - 2133.36] nerve Grapevine what I'm trying to say
[2130.42 - 2135.82] is the Grapevine the vagus nerves that
[2133.36 - 2137.28] run through the body okay that might
[2135.82 - 2140.08] less
[2137.28 - 2144.10] intensify so your symptoms can change
[2140.08 - 2146.50] down here sometimes but yet up here you
[2144.10 - 2149.16] can have more intense symptoms when it
[2146.50 - 2151.60] comes down to Vegas Stars
[2149.16 - 2153.76] inflammation can come and go based on
[2151.60 - 2155.62] whether someone is getting more sleep or
[2153.76 - 2158.32] is lacking sleep do you know that now
[2155.62 - 2161.94] listen listen
[2158.32 - 2161.94] I know I hit a chord
[2163.24 - 2168.22] if you can't sleep good it's okay
[2166.66 - 2170.38] so I'm going to tell you something I
[2168.22 - 2173.38] talk about it in
[2170.38 - 2175.12] protocols
[2173.38 - 2177.58] there's a piece of information in here
[2175.12 - 2179.20] that's so powerful in the protocols book
[2177.58 - 2181.48] it's a technique
[2179.20 - 2183.64] it's absolutely just profound and
[2181.48 - 2184.66] mind-blowing it's about resting the
[2183.64 - 2185.80] nerves
[2184.66 - 2187.54] okay
[2185.80 - 2189.52] and
[2187.54 - 2191.80] you can rest the nerves even if you're
[2189.52 - 2193.06] not sleeping and have those nerves
[2191.80 - 2194.62] heal
[2193.06 - 2196.12] even when you're not sleeping so I don't
[2194.62 - 2197.32] want anybody upset if they don't sleep
[2196.12 - 2199.72] good
[2197.32 - 2201.64] Michelle L says all I do is sleep
[2199.72 - 2203.38] that's a good thing
[2201.64 - 2206.38] meaning like if your true body's trying
[2203.38 - 2209.70] to heal and it's allowing you to sleep
[2206.38 - 2209.70] that's amazing
[2209.98 - 2214.18] as inflammation Ebbs and flows us
[2212.02 - 2217.18] talking about the Grapevine can shift on
[2214.18 - 2219.58] symptoms so if someone is lacking sleep
[2217.18 - 2222.22] or getting more sleep it can shift the
[2219.58 - 2223.90] symptoms they can so if someone's
[2222.22 - 2225.16] sleeping more symptoms can shift if
[2223.90 - 2227.50] someone's not sleeping as much as
[2225.16 - 2228.88] symptoms can shift because when you
[2227.50 - 2230.68] sleep your body is trying to heal
[2228.88 - 2233.94] inflamed nerves and your immune system
[2230.68 - 2236.38] is going after bugs
[2233.94 - 2239.08] inflamed vagus nerves
[2236.38 - 2242.86] big part of that are pathogens like
[2239.08 - 2245.38] Epstein-Barr right these pathogens
[2242.86 - 2247.30] are in are releasing poisons and toxins
[2245.38 - 2249.10] and it's inflaming our brain stem and
[2247.30 - 2252.52] vagus nerves our immune system is trying
[2249.10 - 2255.58] to clean up the pathogens so when we
[2252.52 - 2257.56] sleep our symptoms can lessen in many
[2255.58 - 2259.66] situations because pathogens are trying
[2257.56 - 2261.46] to do their job while you're sleeping if
[2259.66 - 2264.34] you can't sleep you can still heal
[2261.46 - 2267.66] nerves and get through it I've talked
[2264.34 - 2267.66] about that in the books
[2269.32 - 2273.76] other factors that affect inflammation
[2271.72 - 2275.26] include whether someone is less stressed
[2273.76 - 2277.00] or more stressed whether someone is
[2275.26 - 2278.80] eating better than normal or a little
[2277.00 - 2280.78] bit of out of control with their foods
[2278.80 - 2283.48] and whether someone is exercising more
[2280.78 - 2285.10] or less these changes matter
[2283.48 - 2287.74] you do
[2285.10 - 2289.96] on a day with lower inflammation you may
[2287.74 - 2292.72] still have the tightness of the chest
[2289.96 - 2295.14] yet less pressure or pain in the abdomen
[2292.72 - 2295.14] region
[2295.18 - 2299.86] so one day
[2297.16 - 2302.02] you're like why am I less pressure on
[2299.86 - 2304.60] the chest but more tightness on the
[2302.02 - 2308.04] abdomen like why is that happening why
[2304.60 - 2308.04] am I less pressure somewhere
[2311.32 - 2316.12] and then less anxiety and then sometimes
[2313.78 - 2318.28] worse anxiety less vertigo and more
[2316.12 - 2320.26] vertigo and some days balance issues or
[2318.28 - 2322.78] dizziness if the brain stem inflammation
[2320.26 - 2324.64] becomes more pronounced it can feel more
[2322.78 - 2327.34] drastic with all of the symptoms
[2324.64 - 2331.12] combined at an advanced level
[2327.34 - 2333.28] so when the brain stem is inflamed all
[2331.12 - 2334.84] of these symptoms can feel really really
[2333.28 - 2336.52] intense
[2334.84 - 2338.44] I mean there's so many of you guys that
[2336.52 - 2340.36] had like a hundred symptoms and you're
[2338.44 - 2343.32] knocking those symptoms down as you're
[2340.36 - 2345.82] using medical medium information
[2343.32 - 2347.50] viral inflammation combined with toxic
[2345.82 - 2348.76] heavy metals and everyday toxic
[2347.50 - 2350.62] chemicals
[2348.76 - 2352.48] that are inside the brain stem located
[2350.62 - 2354.52] close to the vagus nerves there can
[2352.48 - 2357.16] create most every vagus nerve symptom
[2354.52 - 2358.66] with different variables and to
[2357.16 - 2360.76] different degrees at the same time so
[2358.66 - 2365.38] when people have low-grade viral
[2360.76 - 2368.08] infections and I'm on page 103 right now
[2365.38 - 2371.08] low-grade viral infections and lots of
[2368.08 - 2373.24] metals and toxins that can have vagus
[2371.08 - 2374.92] inflammation in various areas of the
[2373.24 - 2376.30] nerves from the brain stem down to their
[2374.92 - 2378.34] gut
[2376.30 - 2383.50] so I'm in brain saver by the way Page
[2378.34 - 2384.94] 105 103 sorry in brain saver
[2383.50 - 2387.34] you guys we're going to be making the
[2384.94 - 2389.20] nerve acid gut stabilizer I am pumped up
[2387.34 - 2391.78] about that but I'm just reading about
[2389.20 - 2395.40] some Vegas nervement the vagus nerves
[2391.78 - 2395.40] inflammation talk
[2397.30 - 2402.16] in many cases of brain stem and cranial
[2399.94 - 2404.86] nerve inflammation the infection is not
[2402.16 - 2406.84] in the brain stem or nerves themselves
[2404.86 - 2409.36] doesn't mean you have the Epstein-Barr
[2406.84 - 2411.82] virus in your brain stem
[2409.36 - 2413.86] the viral infection such as such as
[2411.82 - 2416.20] Epstein-Barr or shingles herpes simplex
[2413.86 - 2419.26] 1 or Herpes Simplex 2 is inside the
[2416.20 - 2421.60] liver or inside the spleen
[2419.26 - 2424.18] wherever a viral infection is in the
[2421.60 - 2426.16] body if it's releasing viral neurotoxins
[2424.18 - 2428.20] those neurotoxins can travel through the
[2426.16 - 2430.50] bloodstream and land on your vagus
[2428.20 - 2433.60] nerves and inflame them in all kinds of
[2430.50 - 2436.86] whack-a-doodle places
[2433.60 - 2440.56] making the Vegas their Grapevine
[2436.86 - 2443.08] inflamed creating additional symptoms
[2440.56 - 2444.16] whenever neurotoxins inflamabagus nerves
[2443.08 - 2447.60] I want to talk about that what's a
[2444.16 - 2447.60] neurotoxin you guys know medical medium
[2448.38 - 2454.12] byproduct released from a virus like
[2452.26 - 2456.94] Epstein-Barr
[2454.12 - 2460.00] and that byproduct is neurotoxic it's
[2456.94 - 2461.80] it's an allergen to a vagus nerve
[2460.00 - 2466.86] cranial nerve trigeminal neurofascial
[2461.80 - 2466.86] nerve hypoglossal nerve right
[2467.44 - 2473.20] wherever neurotoxins inflamabase nerve
[2469.90 - 2475.24] they create inflammation a hot spot
[2473.20 - 2476.86] so a hot spot
[2475.24 - 2479.26] gotta think about this you got your
[2476.86 - 2480.88] vagus nerve and in that Vegas they're on
[2479.26 - 2484.30] that Vegas nerve there's going to be hot
[2480.88 - 2486.40] spots most people walking around sick
[2484.30 - 2489.18] and visiting their doctor's offices have
[2486.40 - 2493.66] these hot spots on their vagus nerves
[2489.18 - 2495.82] hot spots or are inflamed areas of your
[2493.66 - 2497.50] vagus nerves guys I'm reading on a brain
[2495.82 - 2500.56] saver you guys don't have these books
[2497.50 - 2503.64] saw somebody say what book is that you
[2500.56 - 2503.64] want to get these books
[2505.30 - 2511.54] G2 Vision says you saved me I'm so
[2509.02 - 2514.90] familiar with all of these symptoms I
[2511.54 - 2517.32] had lots and I have I had a loss and
[2514.90 - 2517.32] stress
[2519.70 - 2525.04] before ended up with spasms and crazy
[2522.76 - 2527.74] heartbeat I got on the protocols for the
[2525.04 - 2530.20] vagus nerves symptoms gone
[2527.74 - 2533.28] hearts and praying hands
[2530.20 - 2533.28] I was on IG
[2533.98 - 2539.70] some of these hot spots
[2536.38 - 2539.70] that's incredible by the way
[2540.04 - 2545.08] if a virus attaches itself to a higher
[2543.34 - 2547.00] section of events so first of all I want
[2545.08 - 2549.70] to say something
[2547.00 - 2552.82] foreign
[2549.70 - 2556.48] I'm proud of you
[2552.82 - 2558.84] because it takes it it takes a certain
[2556.48 - 2558.84] person
[2558.88 - 2562.42] to know what this is
[2561.34 - 2564.94] okay
[2562.42 - 2567.52] it takes a certain person to know what
[2564.94 - 2569.94] the heck this whole medical medium thing
[2567.52 - 2569.94] is
[2571.60 - 2576.72] takes a rare person to know what all of
[2574.30 - 2576.72] this is
[2576.82 - 2580.84] like the books the information from
[2579.16 - 2582.70] above
[2580.84 - 2585.48] the protocols
[2582.70 - 2585.48] the mission
[2588.52 - 2593.62] this whole thing is a mission
[2591.10 - 2596.44] to help the chronically ill heal
[2593.62 - 2598.66] it takes a special person to understand
[2596.44 - 2601.26] that
[2598.66 - 2601.26] push through
[2601.48 - 2606.58] and try to do this with all the Flack
[2604.30 - 2609.48] they get in this stupid that they
[2606.58 - 2609.48] get for doing it
[2610.00 - 2614.86] and for all the naysayers and bullies
[2612.64 - 2617.20] and discriminators out there
[2614.86 - 2621.06] it takes a certain person to know what
[2617.20 - 2621.06] all this is that we're doing
[2623.70 - 2630.12] Gabriella says my inflammation has
[2626.50 - 2630.12] reduced after the light blast
[2630.46 - 2633.84] that's music to my ears
[2640.24 - 2644.80] if a vagus nerve attached if sorry if a
[2643.00 - 2647.02] virus attaches itself to a higher
[2644.80 - 2649.12] section of a vagus nerve someone could
[2647.02 - 2650.80] experience a severe bad vertigo where
[2649.12 - 2653.02] they feel stuck
[2650.80 - 2655.36] if you ever had that vertigo where
[2653.02 - 2657.16] you're barfing in a bucket and your head
[2655.36 - 2659.50] is spinning around and you're laying in
[2657.16 - 2661.24] bed and your head's doing this
[2659.50 - 2663.46] like feeling like it's doing this like
[2661.24 - 2665.02] you're laying in bed and your head feels
[2663.46 - 2667.18] it's going like this
[2665.02 - 2668.86] I'm talking like the vertigo the crazy
[2667.18 - 2670.54] vertigo right
[2668.86 - 2673.18] if you ever had that kind of vertigo
[2670.54 - 2676.06] that's when that's not a neurotoxin
[2673.18 - 2678.22] anymore coming from Epstein-Barr that's
[2676.06 - 2681.52] not a Epstein-Barr neurotoxin anymore
[2678.22 - 2684.84] giving you a hot spot on your ve on your
[2681.52 - 2687.88] vagus nerves or vagus nerve
[2684.84 - 2692.02] that's the Epstein-Barr virus attaching
[2687.88 - 2693.46] itself to your vagus nerve up high near
[2692.02 - 2695.38] the brain stem
[2693.46 - 2698.56] so if you had that vertigo where you're
[2695.38 - 2700.00] like holy crap and it's just doing this
[2698.56 - 2702.04] and you feel like your head's doing this
[2700.00 - 2704.38] and you're like oh my God and you're
[2702.04 - 2707.32] laying in bed and you're in in torture
[2704.38 - 2709.90] land with that vertigo
[2707.32 - 2713.08] that's the V that's the Epstein-Barr
[2709.90 - 2715.48] virus attaching itself to the vagus
[2713.08 - 2718.32] nerve that's not a hot spot anymore from
[2715.48 - 2718.32] neurotoxins
[2719.56 - 2722.68] by the way we're day three of the
[2721.24 - 2724.48] medical medium brain shot therapy
[2722.68 - 2726.40] cleanse challenge we're doing 20 days
[2724.48 - 2728.92] we're doing the nerve gut acid
[2726.40 - 2730.66] stabilizer in a little bit we got our
[2728.92 - 2733.86] stuff in front of us
[2730.66 - 2733.86] okay let's get back to business
[2735.46 - 2740.74] the vagus nerves are channels for
[2738.04 - 2742.90] information delivery to the lungs heart
[2740.74 - 2744.70] stomach and intestinal tract your Vegas
[2742.90 - 2748.02] nerves what are they their channels for
[2744.70 - 2748.02] in information
[2749.26 - 2752.58] in formation
[2753.52 - 2757.18] Elvis lives
[2755.32 - 2758.98] Anthony Dot
[2757.18 - 2761.08] could emotional trauma be one of the
[2758.98 - 2762.88] causes of Vegas nerve inflammation and
[2761.08 - 2764.56] could it be stored there for years and
[2762.88 - 2766.24] years with the trauma constantly
[2764.56 - 2769.42] attempting to release itself the problem
[2766.24 - 2771.64] is with trauma is it it lowers our
[2769.42 - 2773.74] immune system
[2771.64 - 2776.98] trauma
[2773.74 - 2778.48] crashes our adrenals and our immune
[2776.98 - 2780.04] system
[2778.48 - 2783.52] and then
[2780.04 - 2785.44] viruses that were dormant
[2783.52 - 2789.40] have a field day
[2785.44 - 2791.20] that's mostly I'm not saying trauma
[2789.40 - 2793.30] can't
[2791.20 - 2795.76] give you PTSD and all kinds of other
[2793.30 - 2797.92] injuries in the soul and in the physical
[2795.76 - 2800.32] brain I talk about how trauma can create
[2797.92 - 2802.30] physical brain injuries in your neurons
[2800.32 - 2804.34] and I talk about it in detail and brain
[2802.30 - 2807.10] saver Elvis lives you have to read the
[2804.34 - 2811.68] emotional brain chapter please it's so
[2807.10 - 2811.68] in depth it's so adapted that at all
[2813.58 - 2818.92] the vagus nerve the Vegas nerves are
[2815.98 - 2822.10] channels for information hey smoking
[2818.92 - 2823.48] Paradise and that information travels
[2822.10 - 2825.46] through the
[2823.48 - 2827.86] vagus nerves but the cause of Vegas
[2825.46 - 2831.04] nerve inflammation is viral and toxic
[2827.86 - 2832.60] heavy metals and toxins it's that's what
[2831.04 - 2835.42] it is
[2832.60 - 2836.68] okay I talk about this also invite
[2835.42 - 2839.02] what's incredible about this book
[2836.68 - 2840.76] there's a section a chapter called viral
[2839.02 - 2843.18] brain and then a chapter called
[2840.76 - 2847.18] emotional brain you'll see where
[2843.18 - 2849.52] traumatic loss in everything can injure
[2847.18 - 2852.28] the brain yes and I talk about that but
[2849.52 - 2856.50] you can see where how it does it and
[2852.28 - 2856.50] then how other things injure the brain
[2856.96 - 2861.10] when our brain's neurons get
[2859.12 - 2864.16] contaminated with toxic heavy metals
[2861.10 - 2866.38] caffeine MSG petrochemicals chemical
[2864.16 - 2868.96] fragrances viral neurotoxins or other
[2866.38 - 2870.94] brain betrayers they can disrupt this
[2868.96 - 2873.10] flow of information so what I'm trying
[2870.94 - 2874.66] to say is information is going through
[2873.10 - 2877.30] your vagus nerve and traveling through
[2874.66 - 2882.78] but if there's enough going on it can
[2877.30 - 2882.78] disrupt this traveling of information
[2882.82 - 2887.02] that that is contaminants interfere with
[2885.16 - 2889.32] the signals that neurons send down to
[2887.02 - 2891.94] the brain stem
[2889.32 - 2894.52] neurons are sending signals down through
[2891.94 - 2896.50] the brain stem down out of your vagus
[2894.52 - 2898.48] nerves
[2896.50 - 2900.36] which in turn affects the signals that
[2898.48 - 2903.28] cranial nerves such as the vagus nerve
[2900.36 - 2905.02] are meant to deliver on rare occasions
[2903.28 - 2906.88] brain tissue becomes inflamed from
[2905.02 - 2909.34] direct viral infection like I talked
[2906.88 - 2910.72] about and this can interfere with neuron
[2909.34 - 2913.06] messaging too so what I'm trying to say
[2910.72 - 2915.34] is your neurons have information in it
[2913.06 - 2917.98] and then that information goes out of
[2915.34 - 2920.50] the brain stem and goes
[2917.98 - 2922.66] out of the cranial nerves like the vagus
[2920.50 - 2926.40] nerves
[2922.66 - 2929.20] D on YouTube this is answering question
[2926.40 - 2932.58] I have about my son the things you
[2929.20 - 2932.58] describe are amazing
[2934.78 - 2939.52] when contaminated messaging travels from
[2937.42 - 2940.78] the neurons down to the vagus nerves to
[2939.52 - 2942.94] the organs such as the heart and
[2940.78 - 2944.68] intestinal tract it's a skewed erratic
[2942.94 - 2946.90] electrical signal with skewed
[2944.68 - 2949.12] information okay you guys hear what I'm
[2946.90 - 2952.68] going now do you hear hear what I'm
[2949.12 - 2955.12] going on this check this out
[2952.68 - 2956.80] that piece of information alone blew my
[2955.12 - 2958.30] mind when I had to
[2956.80 - 2960.28] um transcribe it
[2958.30 - 2963.06] we're in spirit of compassion and get it
[2960.28 - 2963.06] in the books right
[2963.88 - 2968.32] when contaminated messaging travels from
[2966.88 - 2971.68] the neurons you got contaminated
[2968.32 - 2973.48] messaging MSG heavy metals fragrances
[2971.68 - 2974.88] chemicals from chemical companies all
[2973.48 - 2977.38] that stuff drugs whatever
[2974.88 - 2980.26] Pharmaceuticals all that stuff is inside
[2977.38 - 2983.14] the brain right the messaging from those
[2980.26 - 2985.30] neurons can become skewed
[2983.14 - 2988.74] and that messaging
[2985.30 - 2988.74] can become erratic
[2990.88 - 2996.76] it's a skewed erratic electrical signal
[2993.76 - 2997.96] with skewed information all because the
[2996.76 - 3000.42] neurons from which the information
[2997.96 - 3002.22] originated were contaminated
[3000.42 - 3005.16] this is how someone can have an
[3002.22 - 3006.84] electrical heartbeat issue without any
[3005.16 - 3010.14] impeding or obstruction issue okay so
[3006.84 - 3013.34] here's how it works someone can have no
[3010.14 - 3013.34] problems with their heart
[3014.34 - 3020.70] they've been to so many cardiologists
[3017.94 - 3022.50] and they have had no problems with their
[3020.70 - 3026.04] heart
[3022.50 - 3028.94] their valves are good their ventricles
[3026.04 - 3028.94] are good
[3030.00 - 3033.30] they're not having bleeding in their
[3031.62 - 3036.00] ventricles
[3033.30 - 3038.28] they don't have a blockage in their mic
[3036.00 - 3041.46] their small blood vessels and arteries
[3038.28 - 3044.00] in their heart the heart is checking out
[3041.46 - 3044.00] fine
[3047.94 - 3052.88] the doctors like you don't have a heart
[3050.52 - 3052.88] problem
[3055.56 - 3057.80] foreign
[3059.34 - 3063.30] but listen it's an it's a skewed erratic
[3061.86 - 3065.40] electrical signal with skewed
[3063.30 - 3067.02] information all because the neurons from
[3065.40 - 3069.36] which the information originated inside
[3067.02 - 3071.88] the brain were contaminated this is how
[3069.36 - 3075.00] someone can have an electrical heartbeat
[3071.88 - 3077.70] issue without anything impeding or
[3075.00 - 3079.74] obstructing a heart valve or having any
[3077.70 - 3081.60] other heart problem ventricle issue or
[3079.74 - 3083.70] other issues with the heart
[3081.60 - 3085.32] Soul Angel says thank you for all these
[3083.70 - 3087.78] life-saving tools it's been a full
[3085.32 - 3090.48] blessing to me and my autistic twins
[3087.78 - 3094.20] recently diagnosed with celiac disease
[3090.48 - 3096.12] they love the HM detox smoothie have
[3094.20 - 3099.36] metal detox smoothie your life saving
[3096.12 - 3100.62] thank you for being here Soul angel
[3099.36 - 3102.30] foreign
[3100.62 - 3103.80] so there's a whole bunch of people
[3102.30 - 3105.06] walking around with monitors but they
[3103.80 - 3107.10] don't have a heart problem they're told
[3105.06 - 3109.28] maybe it's tachycardia maybe it's afib
[3107.10 - 3110.84] it's aphid it's tachycardia yeah
[3109.28 - 3113.64] electrical
[3110.84 - 3115.56] electrical signals that are actually
[3113.64 - 3117.24] skewed but here's the thing medical
[3115.56 - 3119.28] research and science don't know that the
[3117.24 - 3120.90] reason why the electrical signals are
[3119.28 - 3122.70] skewed coming from neurons in the brain
[3120.90 - 3124.50] is because of some kind of contamination
[3122.70 - 3125.48] issue in the brain but they don't know
[3124.50 - 3128.84] that
[3125.48 - 3128.84] Advanced information
[3132.30 - 3136.92] another way an electrical heartbeat
[3134.46 - 3139.80] issue can occur is if the brain stem is
[3136.92 - 3141.54] inflamed where the vagus nerves exit
[3139.80 - 3143.46] if you have inflammation where those
[3141.54 - 3145.92] vagus nerves exit out of your brain stem
[3143.46 - 3148.62] boom you're hurting too
[3145.92 - 3151.26] Danielle Mangini says wow amazing that's
[3148.62 - 3153.00] what I have low voltage in one chamber
[3151.26 - 3154.38] will the low volt that's how it works
[3153.00 - 3156.66] low voltage I've heard this a billion
[3154.38 - 3157.98] times too well I'm exaggerating it's not
[3156.66 - 3160.32] a billion times
[3157.98 - 3162.66] but I've heard it I mean thousands and
[3160.32 - 3164.58] thousands of times over the years right
[3162.66 - 3166.20] that
[3164.58 - 3167.64] um that that low voltage should have
[3166.20 - 3169.80] heard that it's like why is that
[3167.64 - 3172.08] happening
[3169.80 - 3174.24] contamination inside the brain I've told
[3172.08 - 3176.66] lots of doctors that bring the books to
[3174.24 - 3176.66] your doctors
[3176.82 - 3180.90] Bode Katrin says the chapter on
[3179.40 - 3181.98] emotional brain is so mind-blowing
[3180.90 - 3184.14] honestly
[3181.98 - 3186.60] every time I read the chapter on
[3184.14 - 3188.94] emotional brain inside brain saver my
[3186.60 - 3190.98] mind is blown over and over and over
[3188.94 - 3194.34] again I'm surprised I even have a mind
[3190.98 - 3196.98] left it's been blown too many times
[3194.34 - 3199.32] and not by psilocybins
[3196.98 - 3201.48] and Ayahuasca or anything because I've
[3199.32 - 3204.00] never done anything like that or weed I
[3201.48 - 3206.94] don't smoke weed never did Kimberly all
[3204.00 - 3210.00] good I'm not judging anybody who has
[3206.94 - 3212.40] at all I'm just saying I don't Kimberly
[3210.00 - 3214.50] all good I had heart palpitations and
[3212.40 - 3215.82] drinking celery juice every day stopped
[3214.50 - 3217.92] that issue
[3215.82 - 3222.14] amazing you got all those electrolytes
[3217.92 - 3222.14] sodium cluster salts to your brain
[3224.52 - 3230.28] guys where am I I'm lost I'm lost in the
[3227.64 - 3233.06] chapter now I don't even know where I am
[3230.28 - 3235.38] messaging from neurons in the brain gets
[3233.06 - 3237.24] momentarily blocked in the brain stem
[3235.38 - 3238.86] builds up and then exits with high
[3237.24 - 3241.08] intensities sending signals down the
[3238.86 - 3243.12] vagus nerves that hit the heart oh whoa
[3241.08 - 3244.98] which can cause heart palpitations and
[3243.12 - 3246.90] spasms in other places this is insane
[3244.98 - 3249.42] this piece of information is absolutely
[3246.90 - 3253.40] unbelievable
[3249.42 - 3253.40] what this book is saying
[3254.22 - 3257.46] yes Spirit of compassion what you're
[3256.26 - 3258.78] saying
[3257.46 - 3261.86] is
[3258.78 - 3265.68] that mess what happens is an electrical
[3261.86 - 3267.96] electricity can get stuck
[3265.68 - 3270.54] in the brain stem
[3267.96 - 3272.70] if the vagus nerves right on the coming
[3270.54 - 3275.52] right out of the brain stem are inflamed
[3272.70 - 3278.58] electricity could get stuck and then it
[3275.52 - 3282.14] can get released in a bigger pal and
[3278.58 - 3282.14] when it's released in a bigger pout
[3282.54 - 3287.82] it can intensify sending signals down to
[3285.06 - 3289.92] the vagus nerves that hit the heart
[3287.82 - 3292.08] which can cause heart palpitations and
[3289.92 - 3294.42] spasms in other places that are unknown
[3292.08 - 3296.16] to why it's happening why am I getting
[3294.42 - 3298.26] heart palpitations when my heart is
[3296.16 - 3300.84] checking out fine it's because you're
[3298.26 - 3303.06] getting this electrical shot that's
[3300.84 - 3305.28] coming out of your brain stem
[3303.06 - 3308.18] and running to your heart and hitting it
[3305.28 - 3308.18] faster and harder
[3308.94 - 3312.98] it's a shock to the heart
[3314.70 - 3320.76] my God this book is packed
[3318.56 - 3322.26] this is
[3320.76 - 3324.48] Sarah
[3322.26 - 3325.86] feinstra says you said it takes a
[3324.48 - 3327.72] special person to accept this
[3325.86 - 3329.90] information
[3327.72 - 3332.58] does Darkness attack us
[3329.90 - 3335.70] strategically or is it random does
[3332.58 - 3337.80] Darkness know our potential more than we
[3335.70 - 3340.32] even we do
[3337.80 - 3343.38] I'll do a big talk about that maybe I'll
[3340.32 - 3345.84] do like I'll do a separate show on that
[3343.38 - 3348.00] after we get through
[3345.84 - 3350.28] the incredible 20-day brain shot that
[3348.00 - 3353.10] everyone's Challenge and then we'll talk
[3350.28 - 3355.32] about that I do know this
[3353.10 - 3358.02] darkness in the world does not want this
[3355.32 - 3361.02] information out does not want
[3358.02 - 3364.50] you know credibility to this information
[3361.02 - 3366.42] does not just wants people on
[3364.50 - 3369.36] toxic crap
[3366.42 - 3373.26] and you know and not having answers I
[3369.36 - 3375.84] mean it's no it's no mystery that the
[3373.26 - 3378.54] industries want people in the dark
[3375.84 - 3381.12] me media only says bad things about me
[3378.54 - 3383.52] and remember this remember this okay
[3381.12 - 3387.24] anybody who's here right now
[3383.52 - 3387.24] like media
[3387.36 - 3394.26] most most of the time always just send
[3391.08 - 3398.28] says it says crap about me and
[3394.26 - 3400.44] you know because it's like it's like
[3398.28 - 3402.78] it's like smear campaigns and stuff like
[3400.44 - 3404.40] that and hit pieces like constantly I
[3402.78 - 3405.24] mean that's what it's always been it's
[3404.40 - 3408.24] like
[3405.24 - 3410.88] because it's like they don't want people
[3408.24 - 3412.98] getting this incredible information
[3410.88 - 3414.18] so the lie because that's what maybe is
[3412.98 - 3415.86] allowed to do they're allowed to lie by
[3414.18 - 3416.88] the way I don't know if you guys knew
[3415.86 - 3418.98] that but they're allowed to just say
[3416.88 - 3420.50] anything they want right
[3418.98 - 3423.12] and
[3420.50 - 3425.34] you'll never see media share all your
[3423.12 - 3427.50] unbelievable healing stories that are
[3425.34 - 3429.42] mind-blowing
[3427.50 - 3432.12] that would literally
[3429.42 - 3435.26] each one of your healing stories should
[3432.12 - 3435.26] make People magazine
[3435.36 - 3439.80] that incredible each one of your healing
[3437.94 - 3442.08] stories should make Time Magazine
[3439.80 - 3444.56] that's how unbelievable your healing
[3442.08 - 3444.56] stories are
[3445.14 - 3449.18] you know and and the media won't share
[3447.48 - 3451.98] like healing stories like that because
[3449.18 - 3454.14] you know and the media won't share the
[3451.98 - 3456.80] fact that science is taking the medical
[3454.14 - 3456.80] medium information
[3457.74 - 3463.28] is that unbelievable
[3459.48 - 3463.28] but that's how this world works
[3463.56 - 3468.06] and said they'll write a smear campaign
[3465.24 - 3470.70] instead of like showcasing
[3468.06 - 3474.48] like I gotta tell you something right
[3470.70 - 3477.54] a famous TV show but but also to the
[3474.48 - 3479.10] credit of like TV Land and stuff I mean
[3477.54 - 3481.20] I am offered
[3479.10 - 3482.82] the medical medium like TV series and
[3481.20 - 3483.84] stuff like that but I don't want to I
[3482.82 - 3486.48] don't want to do that I don't want to
[3483.84 - 3489.00] cookie cut and make it all about me
[3486.48 - 3490.02] and then not do the work I I've I've
[3489.00 - 3493.08] been
[3490.02 - 3495.78] um chosen to do right
[3493.08 - 3499.26] but what's interesting is like a really
[3495.78 - 3501.96] well-known show TV show
[3499.26 - 3505.58] having a tech problem on tick I think a
[3501.96 - 3505.58] really well-known TV show
[3505.80 - 3511.08] asked me to come on
[3508.26 - 3513.86] to talk about medical stuff
[3511.08 - 3513.86] and
[3514.02 - 3521.46] so and they said well you can bring
[3517.32 - 3524.04] a healing story a person on there that
[3521.46 - 3525.72] healed or multiple people that healed
[3524.04 - 3526.86] with medical meme information I was like
[3525.72 - 3529.70] you know what
[3526.86 - 3529.70] that's incredible
[3530.28 - 3534.72] so
[3532.44 - 3538.20] the TV show reached out to a whole bunch
[3534.72 - 3540.30] of people like 10 people
[3538.20 - 3541.46] to say hey do you want to come on the
[3540.30 - 3544.08] show
[3541.46 - 3545.04] to be there and have the medical medium
[3544.08 - 3547.26] in you
[3545.04 - 3548.46] talk about your sickness and what you've
[3547.26 - 3549.90] been through and how you healed this
[3548.46 - 3552.06] miraculous story that you have like how
[3549.90 - 3554.94] you got out of the wheelchair
[3552.06 - 3558.18] and and stories like that and so
[3554.94 - 3560.22] people said I would love to
[3558.18 - 3561.90] so then it got close to airing the
[3560.22 - 3564.48] to filming the show
[3561.90 - 3566.90] it got close to filming the show on a
[3564.48 - 3566.90] major Network
[3567.18 - 3570.90] and when we got close to filming the
[3568.86 - 3572.70] show The Producers then reached out to
[3570.90 - 3574.14] me and said by the way you're coming
[3572.70 - 3576.06] today right
[3574.14 - 3580.02] I said yeah I'm coming today
[3576.06 - 3581.76] I'm excited I got my lunch lunch packed
[3580.02 - 3583.56] I'm ready to go
[3581.76 - 3585.42] and then they said
[3583.56 - 3587.52] okay great I said how's everybody else
[3585.42 - 3589.86] doing did you contacted and that we're
[3587.52 - 3592.20] all excited that you told me about oh
[3589.86 - 3595.02] we're not having any of them on
[3592.20 - 3597.24] I said why
[3595.02 - 3598.74] and they said the producer said the head
[3597.24 - 3600.30] producer said
[3598.74 - 3603.00] we just thought it wouldn't be a good
[3600.30 - 3604.68] idea having those 10 individuals on who
[3603.00 - 3606.48] got out of wheelchairs who got who
[3604.68 - 3610.58] healed and everything else we just don't
[3606.48 - 3610.58] think it would be a great idea
[3613.38 - 3619.64] and he said but we'll see we'll see you
[3615.36 - 3619.64] in an hour I said you and I hung up
[3619.74 - 3623.18] all right let's keep on going
[3625.50 - 3630.30] all right let's go
[3627.42 - 3633.50] so on that note
[3630.30 - 3633.50] is that an unbelievable story
[3635.04 - 3638.18] it's like what
[3639.90 - 3643.14] because I I felt so bad because people
[3641.82 - 3645.30] were called
[3643.14 - 3646.74] and they're all excited from what the
[3645.30 - 3648.18] producer said they were going to talk
[3646.74 - 3649.80] about their incredible healing stories
[3648.18 - 3652.08] about how that got out of wheelchairs
[3649.80 - 3654.00] two people were got out of wheelchairs
[3652.08 - 3655.86] two of them out of the ten
[3654.00 - 3659.16] the other eight
[3655.86 - 3660.36] one person right one person is a cancer
[3659.16 - 3664.32] survivor
[3660.36 - 3667.14] using mm info another person
[3664.32 - 3669.30] um the other person was had ALS
[3667.14 - 3671.64] and then got better and another percent
[3669.30 - 3674.28] Alzheimer's and got better
[3671.64 - 3676.26] and there were a few others and they
[3674.28 - 3678.30] didn't they didn't what happened was I
[3676.26 - 3680.76] think the the producers
[3678.30 - 3682.20] we're like holy crap we're gonna put
[3680.76 - 3684.54] somebody on that got better from
[3682.20 - 3686.70] Alzheimer's we're gonna put somebody on
[3684.54 - 3689.88] that he knew 20 years ago that got
[3686.70 - 3691.62] better from ALS and they were they like
[3689.88 - 3693.96] and they're still here and they're fine
[3691.62 - 3695.82] like they were actually like their minds
[3693.96 - 3698.34] were blown
[3695.82 - 3700.26] and they had it all scheduled
[3698.34 - 3702.84] and then they said medical medium come
[3700.26 - 3705.06] on in we're just we're not having any of
[3702.84 - 3707.28] those we're not having the ALS person or
[3705.06 - 3709.92] the Alzheimer's person come in we're not
[3707.28 - 3711.66] having the woman who had four babies at
[3709.92 - 3712.98] age 48 years old when she couldn't get
[3711.66 - 3714.48] pregnant her whole life and she did all
[3712.98 - 3716.04] the medical medium and got pregnant had
[3714.48 - 3718.08] her four babies we're not going to have
[3716.04 - 3720.36] all of them on and and I just couldn't
[3718.08 - 3722.34] believe it Michelle L says they used
[3720.36 - 3724.74] that to reel you in so they could
[3722.34 - 3728.10] sabotage you correct
[3724.74 - 3730.68] correct correct
[3728.10 - 3734.22] all right
[3730.68 - 3736.82] sorry about swearing earlier
[3734.22 - 3736.82] okay
[3737.10 - 3742.56] you guys needy does it all the time and
[3740.76 - 3745.04] that's why I don't take interviews
[3742.56 - 3745.04] anymore
[3745.50 - 3748.22] all right let's go
[3748.68 - 3754.80] but yeah
[3751.02 - 3756.78] it's the craziest thing all right
[3754.80 - 3759.78] so this is incredible information about
[3756.78 - 3761.28] the Vegas stairs let's have a half time
[3759.78 - 3762.48] do you have to you guys want to do the
[3761.28 - 3765.36] robot with me
[3762.48 - 3769.47] maybe the maybe they didn't like the
[3765.36 - 3776.45] robot and that's what they didn't like
[3769.47 - 3776.45] [Music]
[3779.00 - 3796.22] [Music]
[3798.38 - 3802.62] robot try holding your breath don't
[3800.82 - 3803.94] don't try holding your breath the whole
[3802.62 - 3805.86] time because
[3803.94 - 3807.48] I decided to hold my breath because
[3805.86 - 3809.96] that's how you do the best robot where
[3807.48 - 3812.28] you don't breathe
[3809.96 - 3812.82] you gotta hold your breath but don't do
[3812.28 - 3814.74] it
[3812.82 - 3817.76] [Music]
[3814.74 - 3817.76] you don't breathe
[3818.31 - 3824.00] [Music]

[3826.50 - 3834.56] stabilizer we there's more Vegas there
[3829.68 - 3834.56] information in this brain saver book
[3838.20 - 3840.98] and
[3842.24 - 3846.90] we're ready to do it come on let's do
[3844.50 - 3849.84] this I love this shot I'm not kidding
[3846.90 - 3853.02] the shot is so amazing
[3849.84 - 3855.00] and like what health with Liz was saying
[3853.02 - 3856.28] that like she's been doing it the last
[3855.00 - 3858.32] three days is that what you said Liz
[3856.28 - 3861.36] incredible
[3858.32 - 3864.50] all right so
[3861.36 - 3864.50] I'm pumped up
[3866.64 - 3874.80] now this is the mm-1500
[3870.18 - 3878.70] the mm900 mm-1500 are on sale right now
[3874.80 - 3882.48] incredible juicers they squeeze
[3878.70 - 3884.22] the crap out of the juice people are
[3882.48 - 3885.60] asking me all the time and I can't
[3884.22 - 3887.82] answer
[3885.60 - 3889.98] a thousand DMS on what's the best juicer
[3887.82 - 3892.68] I just can't do it right
[3889.98 - 3894.96] so I try to talk about it when I'm using
[3892.68 - 3897.48] the juicer
[3894.96 - 3899.34] anyway I'm gonna okay first of all let's
[3897.48 - 3900.96] talk about the nerve the nerve that acid
[3899.34 - 3903.18] stabilizer let's talk about that one a
[3900.96 - 3904.86] little bit okay
[3903.18 - 3906.60] when I see another comment first of all
[3904.86 - 3909.00] when I see another comment say say after
[3906.60 - 3911.22] the sales over for the mm 1500 900 I see
[3909.00 - 3913.98] a comment saying what's the best juicer
[3911.22 - 3916.38] in the sales over I want to cry
[3913.98 - 3919.38] I want to cry and then if I don't talk
[3916.38 - 3921.30] about the juicer for like six months
[3919.38 - 3923.70] and I think everybody knows what juicer
[3921.30 - 3925.32] is the best they end up with a spinning
[3923.70 - 3927.18] baskets user or something else that they
[3925.32 - 3928.56] got sold into and they're buying they're
[3927.18 - 3930.78] spending dumping all their money into
[3928.56 - 3932.28] produce because it's not squeezing
[3930.78 - 3933.90] enough juice out and they're throwing
[3932.28 - 3937.08] money out the window
[3933.90 - 3939.72] it's insane right
[3937.08 - 3941.64] anyway here's the thing about the nerve
[3939.72 - 3942.90] gut acid stabilizer that's cilantro
[3941.64 - 3945.66] right here
[3942.90 - 3948.36] that's parsley this is curly parsley
[3945.66 - 3951.26] right here this is flat leaf parsley
[3948.36 - 3951.26] parsley right there
[3951.60 - 3955.26] so we have three different things here
[3953.76 - 3957.48] now here's the thing I'm not going to
[3955.26 - 3959.94] combine
[3957.48 - 3962.40] cilantro with parsley
[3959.94 - 3965.94] I'm not gonna mix them
[3962.40 - 3967.92] but you can do either a cilantro shot on
[3965.94 - 3970.64] its own as an option
[3967.92 - 3973.98] so many people
[3970.64 - 3977.04] love to hate cilantro
[3973.98 - 3980.06] they hate cilantro they love to hate
[3977.04 - 3983.70] cilantro right
[3980.06 - 3988.34] okay and then you can do parsley on its
[3983.70 - 3988.34] own too you can pick each one right
[3988.38 - 3993.00] you can pick each one
[3990.90 - 3994.50] keep that in mind
[3993.00 - 3996.36] you might be somebody that's high in
[3994.50 - 3999.30] toxic heavy metals
[3996.36 - 4002.50] and you're doing the cilantro nerve gut
[3999.30 - 4005.72] acid stabilizer
[4002.50 - 4009.32] but you can choose either or
[4005.72 - 4011.84] parsley one is knock your socks off like
[4009.32 - 4015.26] for real love so let's get started I'm
[4011.84 - 4017.18] gonna run some there through here okay
[4015.26 - 4019.16] high in toxic heavy metals don't like
[4017.18 - 4021.44] Taste of cilantro so what happens is
[4019.16 - 4024.02] people who are high in all those toxic
[4021.44 - 4025.46] heavy metals tend to not like the taste
[4024.02 - 4027.74] of cilantro
[4025.46 - 4029.60] where it it does something in their
[4027.74 - 4032.84] mouth it makes their mouth start doing
[4029.60 - 4035.60] some crazy stuff where they despise The
[4032.84 - 4038.72] Taste completely and then when you start
[4035.60 - 4040.70] getting Metals out over time or bursts
[4038.72 - 4042.44] of metals out in different areas of the
[4040.70 - 4045.68] organs as they're coming out over time
[4042.44 - 4047.90] it can waver where you actually can
[4045.68 - 4049.58] stand cilantro or you actually don't
[4047.90 - 4051.68] mind it or to the point where you
[4049.58 - 4053.62] actually love it anything can shift and
[4051.68 - 4058.58] grow and change
[4053.62 - 4061.70] we're doing though the parsley shot
[4058.58 - 4063.86] so I'm gonna run
[4061.70 - 4066.58] my parsley fruit
[4063.86 - 4066.58] right now
[4070.94 - 4076.16] I'm using flat leaf and a little curly
[4074.30 - 4077.84] but I'm gonna just go with more flat
[4076.16 - 4080.42] leaf
[4077.84 - 4081.56] I mean personally you can have either or
[4080.42 - 4085.28] okay
[4081.56 - 4087.46] but personally flat leaf parsley is my
[4085.28 - 4087.46] favorite
[4094.52 - 4096.82] foreign
[4098.78 - 4102.14] so
[4100.04 - 4105.16] these are really big parsley stems
[4102.14 - 4105.16] they're huge
[4106.16 - 4111.14] people are asking the difference between
[4107.72 - 4113.74] parsley and cilantro all the time I can
[4111.14 - 4113.74] tell you this
[4113.78 - 4118.58] okay
[4115.28 - 4120.02] what I recommend is don't always just do
[4118.58 - 4123.26] one
[4120.02 - 4125.36] forever you can
[4123.26 - 4128.00] but if it's everything I'm talking about
[4125.36 - 4130.04] with the nerve gut problems that people
[4128.00 - 4134.02] have
[4130.04 - 4136.58] that I read about in the book earlier
[4134.02 - 4140.14] switch off
[4136.58 - 4140.14] do the parsley shot
[4140.24 - 4144.92] do it for a while and then eventually do
[4142.52 - 4148.06] a cilantro shot
[4144.92 - 4148.06] for like a week
[4150.08 - 4154.40] so I'm putting this incredible parsley I
[4152.36 - 4157.28] get mesmerized by
[4154.40 - 4158.36] beautiful flat leaf parsley what about
[4157.28 - 4161.56] you guys
[4158.36 - 4161.56] sending it right through
[4165.62 - 4170.60] just that I don't usually have flat leaf
[4167.78 - 4174.28] parsley so but today I do so I actually
[4170.60 - 4174.28] really want to focus on that it's fun
[4175.28 - 4180.58] very fibrous
[4177.20 - 4180.58] extremely fibrous
[4183.68 - 4190.10] parsley juice almost becomes gelatinous
[4187.70 - 4191.90] it's the craziest thing
[4190.10 - 4194.62] so I'm gonna be honest I have enough for
[4191.90 - 4194.62] a shot I think
[4199.76 - 4205.88] I mean you almost can spoon
[4202.28 - 4208.18] that parsley juice out it's crazy how it
[4205.88 - 4208.18] works
[4211.70 - 4216.08] it's just crazy
[4214.46 - 4217.40] all right we got a parsley shot right
[4216.08 - 4219.74] here
[4217.40 - 4220.82] Lori asked how long will will the sale
[4219.74 - 4224.36] last
[4220.82 - 4226.04] It's Gonna Last to the end I think of
[4224.36 - 4227.84] the brain set challenge possibly maybe a
[4226.04 - 4232.10] little after I'm not sure
[4227.84 - 4235.88] Sarah how do I get one of those juicers
[4232.10 - 4237.44] in the information do you have
[4235.88 - 4239.18] to get one of these
[4237.44 - 4242.78] link is in profile link is in the
[4239.18 - 4245.30] description there's a medical medium
[4242.78 - 4246.38] customer service line at Omega by the
[4245.30 - 4250.10] way
[4246.38 - 4252.62] you can easily talk to them anytime
[4250.10 - 4254.48] by the way this mm-1500 I just want to
[4252.62 - 4256.34] say does a lot of stuff so it's the
[4254.48 - 4258.38] mm1500 is what you're looking at you're
[4256.34 - 4262.70] not looking at the 800s or anything else
[4258.38 - 4264.70] you're looking at the mm-1500 or mm-900
[4262.70 - 4264.70] um
[4264.92 - 4271.30] so I want to show you something okay
[4268.94 - 4273.86] this is dry
[4271.30 - 4276.32] this is actually dry
[4273.86 - 4280.40] is what this piece of rope is
[4276.32 - 4281.96] this thing was completely cold pressed
[4280.40 - 4284.90] masticated
[4281.96 - 4287.60] and it's it's dry right the mm 1500 900
[4284.90 - 4289.88] you'll buy less parsley you have food
[4287.60 - 4291.26] costs are going up you'll buy less
[4289.88 - 4293.96] parsley
[4291.26 - 4295.82] for your parsley shot there's no juice
[4293.96 - 4298.04] dripping off of this it's basically
[4295.82 - 4301.04] drying out like rapidly because it was
[4298.04 - 4303.32] so so dry right
[4301.04 - 4305.18] I mean it's a joke really the
[4303.32 - 4307.40] centrifugal juicers and the spinning
[4305.18 - 4309.50] basket juicers and all that it's it's
[4307.40 - 4312.32] all this juice comes out in the pulp
[4309.50 - 4316.28] it's wet and sloppy
[4312.32 - 4318.14] right so the juice comes out in the pulp
[4316.28 - 4320.54] you lose your juice it's like wet and
[4318.14 - 4322.58] sloppy it gets discarded people complain
[4320.54 - 4324.32] there's not enough juice
[4322.58 - 4326.72] so people who actually buy those other
[4324.32 - 4328.76] juicers like the like the spinning
[4326.72 - 4330.80] basket ones and the centrifuge ones
[4328.76 - 4331.76] where it's easier to use it you know
[4330.80 - 4333.50] because you're just shoving everything
[4331.76 - 4336.38] in the reason why it's easier to use
[4333.50 - 4338.60] that way is because it's not juicing all
[4336.38 - 4341.36] the juice out it's just spitting it all
[4338.60 - 4344.60] out in the pulp so you don't get dry
[4341.36 - 4346.64] pulp but if you're rich it probably
[4344.60 - 4348.50] won't matter because you can buy a
[4346.64 - 4350.72] hundred heads of parsley
[4348.50 - 4352.46] and just spit all that juice out with
[4350.72 - 4354.02] those because you're not worried because
[4352.46 - 4355.82] you're rich you can buy 100 heads of
[4354.02 - 4357.80] parsley all the time but if you're not
[4355.82 - 4360.62] someone who's got
[4357.80 - 4363.56] you know big big money and you're not
[4360.62 - 4365.90] like wealthy or anything or well off
[4363.56 - 4368.60] it's best to have a juicer that actually
[4365.90 - 4371.24] squeezes the juice out so you're buying
[4368.60 - 4373.88] less parsley so you go and you buy you
[4371.24 - 4377.66] know five heads of parsley instead of 15
[4373.88 - 4380.36] heads of parsley you know you buy like
[4377.66 - 4381.80] six Bunches of celery instead of 20
[4380.36 - 4384.04] Bunches of celery you know what I'm
[4381.80 - 4384.04] saying
[4384.40 - 4388.48] all right now parsley juice
[4388.58 - 4392.96] turns into like a gel I'm just letting
[4391.04 - 4395.56] you know if you let it sit long and I
[4392.96 - 4395.56] let it sit
[4395.60 - 4402.50] I let it sit long
[4398.66 - 4405.14] okay I see daily I see daily people
[4402.50 - 4408.26] struggling and commenting about the cost
[4405.14 - 4409.58] of food and produce and all food right
[4408.26 - 4411.74] people are having a hard time the cost
[4409.58 - 4413.84] of food is going up the mm-1500 and the
[4411.74 - 4416.42] mm-900
[4413.84 - 4417.74] save people money so when they use these
[4416.42 - 4420.68] medicine machines they use these
[4417.74 - 4422.54] medicine makers it's squeezing out more
[4420.68 - 4424.28] juice and they're buying less produce
[4422.54 - 4426.44] that's where you save money so the
[4424.28 - 4428.24] juicer pays for itself
[4426.44 - 4430.06] and the other juicers don't do that but
[4428.24 - 4433.10] here's the other thing the other juicers
[4430.06 - 4435.80] people never really Juiced a lot with
[4433.10 - 4437.00] it's like a juice once a month they use
[4435.80 - 4439.04] it for a couple months and then put it
[4437.00 - 4440.54] in their closet right so that's what
[4439.04 - 4441.62] those are really for people who really
[4440.54 - 4443.00] don't care
[4441.62 - 4445.22] people that have a lot of money they
[4443.00 - 4447.94] juice like once in a blue moon the
[4445.22 - 4447.94] medical medium
[4448.28 - 4454.58] um endorses the 1500 and the 900 because
[4451.88 - 4457.22] it's for the people who juice all day
[4454.58 - 4459.02] long like nobody else does like they
[4457.22 - 4460.70] juice every day three times the juice
[4459.02 - 4464.24] the medical the medical medium Community
[4460.70 - 4465.92] juices like nobody does like nobody does
[4464.24 - 4468.50] they juice every day they're celery
[4465.92 - 4470.06] juice they juice celery twice a day they
[4468.50 - 4472.04] juice at least once a day the medical
[4470.06 - 4473.84] medium Community people you guys know
[4472.04 - 4476.66] you guys know all about it you guys are
[4473.84 - 4478.58] juicing and they juice all the time so
[4476.66 - 4482.54] these machines
[4478.58 - 4484.10] are made for that the other juicers if
[4482.54 - 4485.66] you try to juice like that with the
[4484.10 - 4487.28] spinning basket machines or those other
[4485.66 - 4488.96] juicers
[4487.28 - 4491.12] it ain't gonna happen and those
[4488.96 - 4494.06] warranties aren't like the warranties on
[4491.12 - 4496.76] the 1500 and 900 which are for 15 years
[4494.06 - 4499.04] Parts included it's just unbelievable
[4496.76 - 4501.02] those other ones they stop warrantying
[4499.04 - 4504.08] the parts after like two years two years

[4912.80 - 4918.08] working for the light
[4915.14 - 4920.12] maybe God sends a message and you see
