00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
covering the true
causes of anxiety and depression because

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,240
it's a mystery

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
upon millions of people
have mysterious anxiety and depression

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,960
it's really hard on people so
to talk about what people experience

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,519
when they're
living with anxiety when they're living

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,800
with depression and how debilitating
these symptoms can be how it affects

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
your life
you guys probably know somebody with

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
anxiety you probably know somebody with
depression

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,079
so let's get down to it that's what we
have to do nobody's depression

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,760
nobody's anxiety is the same there's
they're all unique your anxiety is

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,719
unique
to you and what's happening inside your

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
body
they're not the same you just can't

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
classify it you can't tag it like that
you got anxiety okay

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,399
well you got anxiety too well you're
seeing all your symptoms are identical

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,039
that's
really really impossible it's always

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,239
going to vary

you're not so
sick and you just got your first symptom

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
or two and you saw an alternative doctor
or

64
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,159
you saw a naturopath or maybe you saw
you know your regular doctor and they

65
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,120
did a little blood work and you got a
little symptom here and there and you're

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
just
starting to embark on your journey of

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,200
cleaning up your foods and
looking on the internet for answers and

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
stuff if you're in that great position
that's great

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
but there's a lot of people that are
really sick really struggling the

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,959
medical medium information
was for those people and has been and

71
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
got people
off of mattress island if you guys want

72
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
to know what mattress island is many of
you guys know

73
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
mattress island is when you're when
you're in bed and you're in bed too long

74
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
you're in bed a lot you spend a lot of
time on the mattress you spend a lot of

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
time
on the couch couch island mattress

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
island
it's not a fun place and so many people

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
have been there and had to find the
medical medium information

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
so you know here's a point right here
before we go on with anxiety we're going

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
to cover we're going to cover all the
details about anxiety

80
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,759
what kind of different versions of
anxiety what kind of different versions

81
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
of depression and what the true causes
are

82
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,759
before we go into that listen i want to
tell you guys whether you're plant-based

83
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,720
whether you're vegan whether you're
paleo whether you're vegetarian whether

84
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
you're animal protein whether you're
keto animal protein right whether you're

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
keto plant-based
whether you're keto vegan whether you're

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
carnivore
whether you're balanced diet whether

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
you're intuitive eating
whether you're food combining or any

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
other diet belief system there is and
there's a lot of them out there

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,759
everyone has something in common
remember this

90
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,160
they all get sick remember this they all
get sick

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
that's how it's been and that's what
happened so

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
sure you might have things under control
you cleaned up your diet

93
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,600
maybe you're on a plant-based diet but
plant-based people

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
they quit eating plant-based they run to
eating animal protein they go

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,320
start bringing in salmon they start
bringing in eggs oh should i be eating

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,039
eggs
should i be eating salmon should i be

97
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,280
eating turkey maybe i need my protein
maybe that's why i'm getting symptoms

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,560
same thing with the vegans it's like
well wait a minute maybe

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,080
maybe beans aren't cutting it maybe
beans got too much of something

100
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
bad in them and maybe i need to start
eating animal protein and

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,479
that's how it works same thing with
paleo people same thing with animal

102
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
protein people they're like should i go
plant-based

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,919
what am i doing wrong why am i getting
sick and the whole thing is this is that

104
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
what we have to understand something is
that

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
with the food wars and with the
different diet belief systems

106
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,880
everybody eventually gets sick either
they've been sick in the past they get

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,319
sick again in the present
or they get sick in the future that's

108
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
what everybody has in common whether
anybody likes it or not

109
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,080
and if you're young and you feel
indestructible and you haven't got there

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
yet you're going to get sick later on
down the road you know because

111
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
everybody does i talk to doctors all the
time and

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
when i talk to doctors they're like
they'll they'll say it too you're like

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
you're right
everybody's gonna have a thyroid problem

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
later on ever
you're right aw because you nailed it

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,360
you're right everybody you told me that
20 years ago and yes

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
everybody's getting thyroid problems
they get them before they turn 30 now

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
instead they used to get them before
they turned 50

118
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
and that's how it is so if they get sick
it's

119
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,800
that's what it is everybody has
something in common regardless of the

120
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
diet belief system
and that's why there's one thing that's

121
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,360
really important about the medical
medium information there's no

122
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,639
diet belief system here so that's one
thing to know so if you're new here

123
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
there's no diet belief system because
diet belief systems

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,039
get you trapped and then you don't heal
because there has to be something more

125
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
to that
because plant-based people get sick

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
vegans get sick
vegetarians get sick animal protein

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,599
people get sick keto people get sick
everybody gets sick whatever diet

128
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,560
beliefs and belief system that they're
subscribed to

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
or they're attached to so really
important to know

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
that there's not that here that's the
last

131
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
thing we have going on instead what we
have is tools

132
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,400
that you can apply and plug into your
diet belief system and that's the whole

133
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
thing
actual tools and answers for instance

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,400
like the heavy metal detox smoothie
right there so

135
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,160
that's the medical medium heavy metal
detox movie i made it for dinner tonight

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
you guys which i'm really excited about
and talking about the heavy metal detox

137
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,199
smoothie because why
hmm anxiety why uh depression

138
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
well nobody knew what causes those until
the medical media books were published

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
until all that stuff happened what
causes anxiety

140
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
what causes mystery depression yeah you
got it toxic

141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,000
heavy metals mercury aluminum
copper in the brain toxic heavy metals

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
are responsible
for anxiety that's one of the main

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
causes of anxiety and depression
so then and that leads to a lot of

144
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,719
different conditions you guys bipolar
asperger's focus in concentration adhd

145
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,880
ocd
all of that it leads to lots of that

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
even schizophrenia
all of it so i mean you know and you

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
know what's funny about science and
research you just want to say this

148
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
before we go into this
science and research science and

149
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
research believes you know your bipolar
is just

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
a mystery and they believe that it's
just you being up or down

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,519
you know you're just you're just that
kind of person where

152
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,399
there's no reason why you're doing this
you're just all over the place you're

153
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,040
either north or south how about that for
a diagnosis

154
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
incredible all the money in science and
research

155
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
all the incredible you know like doctors
and technology that we have today and

156
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,959
the best they have for bipolar
is we don't know why you're all over the

157
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
place
um sir uh we

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,800
ma'am we don't know why you're up manic
boom down crashed and depressed um

159
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
we're just scratching our heads with all
the science and technology we

160
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
have that's what science research has
we're either going to say

161
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,720
maybe it's genetic or maybe we'll just
say um

162
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
let's see maybe you need a psychiatrist
try that

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
and then um maybe we're just going to
label this

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
this illness and label it bipolar what a
brilliant label

165
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
right meaning north and south isn't that
brilliant

166
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
oh my god it's unbelievable it's an
insult it's really disgusting it's

167
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
negligence at its best with science and
research that's just one

168
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,839
example of what's happening and
you know the whole thing is it's

169
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
critical to know why
you have a problem and it's in your way

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
and it's impeding your quality of life
and it's like in the way of things you

171
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
want to do
and and we're going to cover that about

172
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,640
anxiety we're going to talk about that
in the whole bit and

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,519
the whole thing with the diet belief
systems is the reason why you won't find

174
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
that here is because this is about
answers and tools

175
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
and that's what's critical it's about
how to use things therapeutically

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,720
that's what it's about medical medium is
not a plant-based diet medical medium is

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
not an animal-based diet medical
medium is not any of those in any way

178
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
which way possible
it's all these answers that can be

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,839
plugged into someone's belief system
to help them recover and heal because

180
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
what i've noticed and many other people
have over the decades

181
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
is whatever you try you're still going
to end up with a problem and get sick in

182
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
the whole
the whole thing there's people out there

183
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
i thought they were on the best
plant-based

184
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,440
diet possible and they got sick and then
they're flip-flopping and the same thing

185
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
with people with the animal protein
diets the best animal product protein

186
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,279
diets possible
and they're flip-flopping they're going

187
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,680
to the other side so it's
it's been like that all along but here's

188
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
the difference now
it's getting worse and worse and worse

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,760
30 years ago the amount of anxiety cases
that i used to see

190
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,640
30 years ago were a fraction of what
they are today and that's with organic

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
food here
that's what people are switching up

192
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
their diets getting rid of fast food
that's what people do in their peanut

193
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,160
butter
their peanut butter smoothie bowls

194
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,079
that's what people do in their protein
shakes and anxiety is skyrocketing

195
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
even with all the good things we're
talking about we're bringing in

196
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,720
that's what's happening here it's
unbelievable so

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
um you guys you know these things are so
important feel free

198
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
to bring what information that you learn
here to your doctor

199
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
and to your health care provider to your
health care practitioner to whoever that

200
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
takes care of your health feel feel free
i'm going to breed how to cleanse the

201
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
heal a little bit right here okay
and we're going to talk about anxiety

202
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
the true cost and then we're going to
cover through all the different levels

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,720
of anxiety
and you might know somebody that's

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
dealing with some type of anxiety so
we're going to cover

205
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
the first type of anxiety in a minute
we're going to go into emotional anxiety

206
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,279
like what is that
emotional anxiety so we're going to

207
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,560
cover in that too

oils you know what
people looked at me like a flying saucer

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,320
just landed behind me
and i had 10 heads back 30 years ago

216
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
when i was lecturing a health food store
and saying

217
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,040
no canola oil you guys have no idea
that you shouldn't be doing canola oil

218
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,279
all the vegans any vegans that existed
back then 30 years ago

219
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,000
were drinking the canola oil and i was
like no canola oil no canola

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
canola oil right the whole bit and then
all of a sudden what happens now after

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
that
plus publishing it someone will hear

222
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
canola oil is bad and then they'll be
like oh anthony

223
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
he just he didn't know a bit he just
what everybody knew that no

224
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
no one knew that back then it's
incredible it's one of them that's one

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,199
of the advanced pieces of information
that i brought to town

226
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,760
35 years ago 30 years ago which it was
no canola oil

227
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,800
and that you know when the first book
came out medical medium first book came

228
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,240
out six years ago and i said no canola
oil everybody was like what

229
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
where huh what it's just funny it's
really funny

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519

235
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,360
or something or tell them to go to the
library and get it for free

236
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
in australia the books in the library i
just i

237
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
on facebook last time i was live
somebody said that they said no you can

238
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
get the books free at the library and
you know right in australia i couldn't

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,199
believe it i was so psyched
so let's go into this a little bit here

240
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,240
true cause of anxiety when anxiety
interferes with your life is anxiety

241
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,279
interfering with your life but do you
have

242
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,360
like any of the anxiety symptoms because
i'm going into it in depth in a minute

243
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,880
is it interfering in your life in any
way

244
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,120
it's caused by toxic heavy metals
such as mercury aluminum and copper hey

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
maybe you're somebody you're like okay
now i know the answer

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,680
let me go and hop on the internet um
toxic heavy metals

247
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
causing anxiety first of all if it even
is on the internet and says that it came

248
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
from here but
most importantly when you go you might

249
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,839
see a whole bunch of things like um
corella can get my metals out let me go

250
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,120
and do that um
activated charcoal can get my metals out

251
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
no
no bad no corella can't get

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,480
metals out you know worth the life of it
it can't get metals out of somebody

253
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
activated charcoal terrible to take
terrible to take

254
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,680
internally a terrible thing to do and
activate the charcoal internally with

255
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
anybody who has bloating gut problems
gut

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
issues sensitivities in the gut inflamed
intestinal linings

257
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
gallbladder trouble liver issues
stagnant sluggish liver

258
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,759
lymphatic issues taking activated
charcoal epic disaster

259
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,040
just so you know and it won't remove
toxic heavy metals because it doesn't

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
there's no proof it never had there's no
study that can

261
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
show it actually grabbing metals it's
one of those those

262
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
bad ideas that's number one corella so
your other oh anthony says toxic heavy

263
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,040
metals
is behind my anxiety let me go on here

264
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,279
online oh wait
corella yeah nice try corella this is

265
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
terrible bacteria in almost every one of
those different

266
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,399
batches that are out there i've seen
corella barrel people like

267
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
get them so sick where they're in the
hospital

268
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
vomiting and diarrhea for days at a time
and the doctor's like i don't know maybe

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,560
you got food poisoning i don't know
no corella bad bad and you'll still see

270
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,759
influencers today with all the work i've
done try to let people know that it

271
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,440
doesn't get
it doesn't get metals out and all the

272
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
work i've done all these years
still see a new influencer that's

273
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
remember because no one knows what's
going on

274
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,759
another five years later there's all
these influencers that are being told

275
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
corella
and they're just out there saying i'm

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
taking my corella got it mixed up here
in my drink in my smoothie

277
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
it's like first of all no metals are
going to come out second of all

278
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,320
terrible for you and i know listen i
know it's got nutrients in it don't get

279
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
me wrong but i'm just saying
that's where it goes wrong these other

280
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
avenues
and activated charcoal awful so that's a

281
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,520
couple things too so
toxic heavy metals such as mercury

282
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,559
aluminum and copper
okay and viral issues

283
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,720
when it comes down to anxiety depression
a lot of times there's a viral issue

284
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,120
involved
so we have to know that the the

285
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,679
epstein-barr is one of the most
infamous viruses i talk about i mean

286
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
that's the one
that actually is behind a lot of

287
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
depression a lot of anxiety now
you don't even have to have any any ebv

288
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
you don't even have to have
ebv symptoms which nobody knew existed

289
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,080
as far as the symptoms go until the
publications of medical media book one

290
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,000
but and how that works but the point is
it's it's a combination

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
of both epstein-barr for a lot of people
and toxic heavy metals because here's

292
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
how it works
if you're viral and you have it in your

293
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
liver and it's low grade it's been there
for decades

294
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
it ends up feeding on foods and what its
favorite

295
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,039
food is is mercury mercury
aluminum copper so when the viruses

296
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,280
feed off of mercury they go to bathroom
yes viruses eat that's advanced medical

297
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
information
ahead of science and research and when

298
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,880
viruses eat they release
a toxic heavy metal byproduct

299
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,919
so it's called the neurotoxin that
neurotoxin

300
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,320
floats around and goes to the brain it's
short circuits

301
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,080
neurotransmitter chemicals it lands on
neurons it saturates neurons

302
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
causing varieties of anxiety and
depression

303
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
you can have that going but you don't
even have to have the viral issue

304
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,240
you can be without the viral issue and
be straight toxic heavy metals

305
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
straight mercury in your system straight
aluminum in your system oh i don't have

306
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
mercury in my system there's no way i
don't have

307
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
oh i gotta had a mercury test i don't
have mercury in my system yeah you do

308
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,960
everybody does it gets passed on from
generation to generation

309
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,039
and it settles in our organs deep
in our organs so it's really important

310
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
to know like our brain
settles in our brain and i'm going to

311
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
talk about what it does there tonight
like why do we get the anxiety

312
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,280
and you know the whole thing no one knew
viruses and toxic heavy metals

313
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,640
are behind anxiety depression that never
existed

314
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,960
anywhere except for medical medium
information so if you know it

315
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,320
never existed anywhere else but you're
going to hear about it more because of

316
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
millions and millions of books
from the medical medium series have been

317
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
circulating around the world
and so people get a little tidbit here

318
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,960
and they're like oh yeah medals
somebody might say metals might behind

319
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
that metals might be behind adhd metals
might behind brain brain fog

320
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,960
comes from the medical medium literature
medical medium information

321
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,440
um and it's behind mystery depression
toxic heavy metals are behind anxiety

322
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
you have to have the
metals there so i'm going to talk about

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
also the best stuff to use like i got
that medical medium heavy metal detox

324
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
smoothie right here so if you want to
get metals out

325
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
this is what you got to do and i'm going
to talk about talk about how and

326
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,039
and everything and what we what you know
i put in here with spirit compassion and

327
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,400
i put in here
the whole bit how it works and in the

328
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
book the heavy metal detox cleanse so
then you can learn how to get metals out

329
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
that way
i saw comments recently on some of the

330
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
lives
i saw comments in some other places

331
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,799
people leave on the youtube if you you
know check out my youtube right

332
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,720
and people say their anxiety
has dissipated has just disappeared when

333
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
they did the heavy metal detox cleanse
when they did the heavy metal detox

334
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
smoothies when they do the medical
medium

335
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
information that they got rid of
horrific

336
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
horrendous anxiety that was crippling
but

337
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
there's thousands of people that have
gotten themselves recovered and got

338
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
their lives back with anxiety
and depression over the years really

339
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
over the years i hope i'm not running
this by you guys too fast i'm talking a

340
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
little quicker because you wouldn't
believe how much i have to

341
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,440
be covered tonight so so um we have
we have in almost an hour so let's do it

342
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
and
you know the whole thing is it's not

343
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,880
just removing the toxic heavy metals
it's repairing

344
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,679
the damage here's something to
digest right here here's something to

345
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
take in you guys when a toxic heavy
metal

346
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,320
sits on a neuron in your brain or sits
on organ tissue it saturates that organ

347
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,559
tissue
okay it ends up burning a hole

348
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,919
and that's what it does a microscopic
hole

349
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,640
because it by it has byproduct
metal oxidizes inside our brain and body

350
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,480
it's advanced medical information from
um from the medical medium information

351
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,120
so and what it does is
when toxic heavy metals oxidize in our

352
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,840
organs
whether it's in our liver whether it's

353
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,520
in our brain whether it's inner spleen
anywhere in our bodies when it oxidizes

354
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,320
it leaves residue that's toxic behind it
and it starts to rust

355
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,480
out holes in tissue it damages cells
tissue is what it does when toxic heavy

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,240
metals sit on a neurotransmitter
meaning it destroys it weakens it

357
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,600
dehydrates it
when a toxic heavy metal sits on a

358
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,360
neuron
it weakens it it short-circuits it so

359
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,640
when you have when you have electrical
impulses firing all around through the

360
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,840
brain
that are supposed to keep us focused on

361
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,120
spot on with our
everything you know able to articulate

362
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,679
able able to communicate
able to talk able to have fun able to

363
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,120
kind of feel excitement
able to actually all these things and

364
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
multitask and to be on our game and to
be down on

365
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
like totally going everything going
great and how we feel

366
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,440
focus concentration like boom all of it
with all of that when our neurons are

367
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
saturated with toxic heavy metals
and those electrical impulses that are

368
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
firing in our brain hit those
neurons that are that are saturated with

369
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
the metals and it hits the metal
it short circuits it weakens the

370
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,320
electrical impulse and then we're like
i got i don't know i got some brain fog

371
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,960
i'm a little more tired i really
and i'm just i got some anxiety i can't

372
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,240
sit still i
i feel like i don't know i'm kind of

373
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
clammy palms i don't want to really talk
to this person

374
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,720
i feel like i can't get my words out
right um

375
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,320
i'm just i feel like my skin's crawling
i want to jump out of my skin

376
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,120
um i can't focus i just need to do
something i like to do i can't do this

377
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,480
stuff i don't like to do because what i
do i just get totally out of it

378
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,880
like all these different things you know
and when someone asks anything of me i

379
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,840
just
i'm not responsive i can't come up with

380
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,760
an answer in time
i can't really you know focus on what

381
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,720
i'm saying when i stand there and
somebody's talking to me i'm trying to

382
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
think about the next thing i'm going to
say but i don't know what i'm going to

383
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,600
say
and all of these things happen these are

384
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,799
just i'm just going over a couple little
things so we're going to cut into it

385
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,279
let's go in just a little bit more so in
this book cleanse the heel

386
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,320
i talk about supplements and dosages
right here for helping to repair

387
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,240
injuries caused by these toxic heavy
metals causing depression and anxiety

388
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,039
so um kale says what if you have anxiety
depression

389
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,520
acne fatigue all of the above okay what
you do is you take

390
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,799
the symptom that's bugging you the most
this is what i would do this is just

391
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
what i would do i would go to cleanse to
heal

392
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,799
or you can bring it to your practitioner
doctor and i would

393
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,840
go and i would take the symptoms that's
bothering you the most

394
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
is fatigue bothering you the most and
then i would go in there

395
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,799
and i would do the fatigue thing like i
would look at the protocol i would take

396
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,159
a look and look at everything in the
back of the book okay

397
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,840
and that's what i would do and i would
learn what the true cause of your

398
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,159
fatigue is
and that's what i would do i'd be like

399
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,840
what's the true cause of my fatigue
because i want to know i want to know

400
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,440
the true cause of my fatigue
and once you do that and you start

401
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,880
applying what's in cleanse to heal for
your fatigue

402
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
or having your practitioner or your
doctor friend or anybody that you have

403
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
helping you apply it you notice other
things

404
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
start to go away like the acne will
start going away

405
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
anxiety starts getting a little better
depression starts getting a little

406
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,559
better
that's one way to go at it and you could

407
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,360
also go at it individually you can go
with anxiety you can go with the

408
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,760
depression
so let's talk about emotional anxiety

409
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,159
so let's go in there next you guys i'm
gonna read comments too

410
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
um does high dosage of vitamin c really
good

411
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,760
high dosages of vitamin c kill viruses
that's really a great a great question

412
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
here
you'll see in the supplements in the

413
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
protocols and the dosages you'll see the
vitamin c

414
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
and you'll see there's vit the medical
medium vitamin c shock

415
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,559
therapy that's there for a reason
so it's really important to know so um

416
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,480
and and the micro c is the one that i
like the best

417
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
just looking at your comments i don't
want to try i don't want to miss too

418
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,559
many i want to catch what i can
the micro microc is actually the one i

419
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
use right here so there's different
vitamin c

420
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
so yeah we can use the term vitamin c
but if it's not a really good one

421
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,799
how much is it doing is it knocking down
viruses vitamin c does a couple of

422
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,360
things okay
high dosages does help kill off viruses

423
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,440
and that's why i've been recommending it
for years and years and years and years

424
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
the medical medium vitamin c shock
therapy is there for a reason

425
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,520
but what vitamin c is somebody using
what kind of vitamin c is somebody using

426
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,799
that's a whole other game so the micro c
is the one i use

427
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,320
that's my favorite i'm not sponsored by
this company okay there's a lot of

428
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
companies like
you know wyman blueberries is the one i

429
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,159
use for my heavy metal detox movies it's
the wyman

430
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,440
wild blueberries i'm not sponsored by
the company i don't own wyman's

431
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
people asset all the time they think i
own wyman's i get questioned on that

432
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
there's even articles out there about
does he own wyman's

433
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
you know what i mean i don't own vimergy
um but yeah best vitamin c

434
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,440
right there it's amazing how many
stories go around but people just buy

435
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,360
the bs they just meaning they
they believe in any story going around

436
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
it's unbelievable anything
you put out on me it's just anybody will

437
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
just bite it and be like oh it must be
true when it's not

438
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,120
it's unbelievable and i stand behind
that so

439
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,000
lemon balm is a big deal so lemon balm
the vimergy lemon balm is important too

440
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
i'm going over some of these i'm looking
here

441
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,640
so just bear with me a second you guys
one of the one of the most like

442
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,720
incredible things that
i've like recommended over the years and

443
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
so forth and i talk about in cleansing
heal is the lemon balm all right

444
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
the lemon balm for anxiety is really
helpful but you know and

445
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,120
and i love like if you go into the
anxiety section in the back of cleanse

446
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
of heel you'll see
the dosages of lemon balm this is the

447
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,799
vimergy lemon balm it's the cleanest
it's the greatest

448
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,480
and you know people say to me they're
like oh why do you like vimergy

449
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,279
right okay well how about this they're
the only company or the only company

450
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,320
i've known
or no out of all the companies i know

451
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
out there because i'm always wanting the
best for people out there

452
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,799
the only company that independently
gets every single product tested for

453
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,039
toxic heavy metals
it costs a fortune that's why companies

454
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,760
won't do it
that's why companies won't do it and

455
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,399
every single product they get
independently tested that's the

456
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,360
difference right there
you might hear some company like that

457
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,600
there's a lot of people you guys
that troll medical medium channels

458
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
listening to me because they're
competitors

459
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120
in weird ways like authors that do
medical

460
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,640
stuff and all that they just get upset
and jealous about all the advanced

461
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,520
information from the
from medical media books and so forth

462
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,080
but there's people out there
that are like um well and then they'll

463
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
they'll hear me say this company's
independently tested by metal so then

464
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,520
they'll tell people
they'll get they won't do it

465
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,960
independently but oh we test for heavy
metals in one of our products we test

466
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,919
for heavy metals it's just a scam out
there 24 7.

467
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,440
but this company independently checks
tech gets

468
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
sends it out and gets it tested for
toxic heavy metals

469
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,799
costs a fortune that's just one example
you know and i'm saying that because

470
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,399
a lot of people say supplements have
metals in them you know i mean

471
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,520
you know that whole thing yeah bad
supplements do anyway

472
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,760
that's incredible for anxiety that i've
you know that that's what i would do so

473
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,679
panic attacks
that's what i'm talking about and i like

474
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,679
the lemon bomb for panic attacks
i don't have panic attacks but if i had

475
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,200
a panic attack
that's what i would do i would be doing

476
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,880
the lemon bum and i would be doing the
dosages personally that's what i would

477
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,360
do
in cleanse the heel on that that's a

478
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,039
takeaway right here that's important
because it's one thing to talk about the

479
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,520
causes of anxiety which i'm going to go
into

480
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,399
it's another to actually have a takeaway
of what can i do what kind of what

481
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,440
tool can i use and so that's important
so in the supplements

482
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
in a protocol section in the back of
cleanse the heel

483
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,799
you look up anxiety you'll see there's
lemon balm like as one of the listed

484
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,880
supplements
so that's what i would do and um

485
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,799
nerves get inflamed with anxiety so
here's the other thing

486
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,440
the most critical nerve that gets
inflamed with your anxiety is your vagus

487
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,600
nerve
that is the big one the other nerves

488
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,679
that get inflamed with you that are
inflamed and are behind

489
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,520
anxiety are your phrenic nerves your
phrenic nerves run

490
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,960
down in through down through your neck
and down here like this they run like

491
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
that
your phrenic nerves what they do is they

492
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,720
light up
they get they just light up they get

493
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,399
inflamed from both neurotoxins from
viruses

494
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,320
and toxic heavy metals that are feeding
the viruses

495
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,520
so these nerves these phrenic nerves get
inflamed and when they get inflamed

496
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,919
you're you light up you're
hypersensitive you can be triggered easy

497
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
you can be like you can you can get
emotional easy

498
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,440
you can all these things it can throw
you in a panic attack

499
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,600
your vagus nerve can tighten up your
throat and make you feel like you're

500
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,799
you're choking
your your vagus nerve can tighten up

501
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,840
your chest
make it hard for you to breathe and you

502
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,360
feel like you got anxiety and you feel
like you're hyperventilating

503
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
or even not even just that you feel like
you have tightness of the chest

504
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,640
and it's it's hard and if you even focus
on your breath it's why

505
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
it's why there's two kind of sides to
the story when it comes down to

506
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,519
meditation this is an important point
so you guys hear this okay if you can

507
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,080
all right um
if you got the patience for a second

508
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,799
meditation okay
does help some people with small bouts

509
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,559
of anxiety like
small bouts of of of anxiousness or

510
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,360
anxiety okay
and it does and that's why i love

511
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,440
meditations but for the most
majority of people suffering from

512
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,200
anxiety
they can't meditate they if they sit

513
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,559
there
and they focus on their breathing they

514
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,559
go into panic attack
because their nerves are inflamed and

515
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,120
nobody knows so then somebody be like oh
you're just

516
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,640
you're just too you can't do it you
can't you can't focus

517
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,600
you can't do that you know um there's
miranda kerr right there

518
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,360
flynn says hi tell flynn i said hey

521
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,640
love him
and um so you know it's amazing how it

522
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,480
works and our phrenic nerve
our vagus nerve all three of those

523
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,039
nerves they
light up so when you're trying to do

524
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,120
your meditations it's difficult
90 of people with anxiety

525
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,440
like real anxiety issues not just
calling it anxiety

526
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,679
and it's not but real anxiety issues
can't meditate

527
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,760
they can't do breath work because it'll
throw them into a panic

528
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,840
it'll increase their anxiety they're
really struggling and i'm going to go

529
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,399
over the different levels of it
that's why band-aids like meditation and

530
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,600
band-aids like breath work
are great and they're great and i and i

531
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,120
always for years
40 years have been saying definitely do

532
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,200
those and i even have meditations i talk
about in the books and and i'm going to

533
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,679
put out more too
in the future but the point is is we got

534
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,640
to get down to the
bottom of why somebody's crippling

535
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
anxiety their throat tightens their
chest tightens they can't breathe

536
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
they go into you know spasms they go
into panic

537
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
they can't sleep their mind is racing
their thoughts are racing

538
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,480
they're you know really struggling all
of that so

539
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,080

breathe

546
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,840
so you totally get it right well 90 plus
percent of people suffering with any

547
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,960
kind of anxiety and depression but
here's the thing

548
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,159
that you know meditation gurus don't
know this they don't know this they

549
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,599
think you're just not
maybe thinking positive enough or

550
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,639
there's some other emotional
thing happening in you that makes it so

551
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,919
you can't meditate what
people don't realize in the spiritual

552
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,359
movement is why i got so popular back
you got to remember you guys

553
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,200
meditation has been around forever okay
and

554
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,679
and it's a helpful band-aid but it's
been around for a long time when my

555
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,079
office
was filled in with thousands upon

556
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
thousands of people traveling around the
world to my offices

557
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,240
years and years ago they tried all that
they tried retreats and meditations and

558
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,079
and all the different levels and unless
you know what's wrong

559
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,280
and how to fix it and get the right
foods in you the right tools

560
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,760
get the metals out get the viruses down
rebuild the neurotransmitters

561
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,960
rebuild the neurons unless you know how
to do that

562
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
it you know and then you don't have to
manage and manage

563
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,440
and you know and i'm not talking about
light anxiousness because of emotional

564
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,800
stress i'm not talking about that like
when somebody goes through an emotional

565
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
hard time
and they got that anxiousness and they

566
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,200
got that mild anxiety because they've
been through a lot and they have anxiety

567
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
you can meditate
pretty easy for the most part with that

568
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,920
i'm talking about
viral anxiety i'm talking about swollen

569
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,599
vagus nerve anxiety i'm talking about
phrenic nerve anxiety i'm talking about

570
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,040
neurotransmitter burnout anxiety
i'm talking about neuron burnout anxiety

571
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,880
it's these things and and that's why i
was so known

572
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
too was like oh my god i tried
everything but what can i do

573
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,720
and there's real answers that's what we
need to talk about

574
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,000
um
yeah okay so uh 777 trickster the

575
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,599
nervous system
feels unsafe which is what causes

576
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,480
anxiety nope that's not what causes
anxiety and

577
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,200
i don't think that's going to get
anybody anywhere

578
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,960
i mean i'm not making fun of you at all
i mean it's totally cool to feel that

579
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
way
and be like well maybe the nervous

580
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,000

592
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,280
you're not sure if you're upset

593
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,920
kind of like not sure if you get mad
you're not sure if you're really

594
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,800
frustrated and you get
lonely really easy like you're like

595
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,880
on the street walking and you feel like
lonely already and you see other people

596
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,560
vibing out there and you're like you
know feeling like you're missing out on

597
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,480
something
maybe you feel like you're missing out

598
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
on something on life maybe
you want to go do something and maybe

599
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,359
you want to go somewhere and you feel
like you wish you could but maybe you

600
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,240
can't in that moment
maybe you need to maybe you feel like

601
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,280
you need to be someplace else like
you're not in the right place in your

602
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,839
life and you need to be someplace else
right

603
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,200
maybe you feel all that at the same time
but yet

604
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,400
you also feel like you want to stay home
and you want to curl up in bed

605
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,640
and you want to just curl up in bed and
be in your comfy sweats and just

606
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,480
kind of hide away and watch your
favorite movie eat your favorite comfort

607
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,880
food
but yet that doesn't make you happy

608
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,400
either and then you feel kind of anxiety
over it you just ate your comfort food

609
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,079
you watched your favorite movie you got
some peace but yet you can't really find

610
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,920
peace
you feel like you're missing out you

611
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,720
want to connect with some friends you
used to know

612
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,040
and you're kind of all over the place
and when you do talk to a friend about

613
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,520
it
and they ask you what's wrong with you

614
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,520
you tell them that you have anxiety
you know and or they or they tell you

615
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,480
you have anxiety where they talk to you
and you're like talking to your friend

616
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,040
and your friends like i think you have
anxiety or

617
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,880
and you know and this is really mild and
the funny thing about this it's not

618
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,480
funny but
you end up it ends up leading into like

619
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,280
going
full force into something this type of

620
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,440
anxiety ends up pushing you into full
force to take care of yourself like

621
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,880
i'm gonna take care of myself i'm gonna
it's like i'm gonna exercise exercise

622
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,320
exercise exercise i'm gonna make my
smoothie bowls make my smoothie bowls

623
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,560
and you feel like full force into it and
you're like going full throttle and then

624
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,520
all of a sudden it could flip to that to
no self-care at all

625
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,119
where you're just all self-care because
you're feeling these feelings and you

626
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,200
don't know why you're feeling them and
you're

627
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,680
trying to get into some meditations
because you don't know why you're

628
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,839
feeling them
and you're trying to like explore

629
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,400
spiritual stuff because you don't know
why you're feeling them and then you're

630
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,079
pushing it full throttle and you're
exercising you're eating better

631
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,760
and then it flip-flops and it goes boom
into no no self-care

632
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
and you're doing nothing at all like
you're back in your sweats you're in

633
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,920
you're in your bed
you're depressed a little bit you're sad

634
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
you're not sure you're frustrated you
feel like you're missing

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,560
out on something and that's one very
mild version of anxiety but people have

636
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
it i totally you know
here's another mild version you can't

637
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,280
sit still you feel like there's just
something creeping

638
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
you know like in your body you feel like
you're you know there's something

639
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,040
creeping up your spine and you you can't
sit still

640
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,640
and you know you're just you have to
keep moving you have to keep moving and

641
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,680
there's that kind of anxiety where you
feel like if you slow down

642
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,440
and you slow down it's just you know and
it's it's all of a sudden it picks up a

643
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
little bit more
here's another version right here of

644
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,040
anxiety a mild one thoughts are
racing did you ever have that do you

645
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,160
know somebody that has the racing
thoughts anxiety

646
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,359
where it's like you can't control the
thoughts

647
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,160
they're racing it happens either when
you wake up first thing in the morning

648
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,440
really early
it happens right before you go to bed it

649
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,480
happens during the day when you're even
trying to focus you're trying to

650
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,720
concentrate on something
and you're just your your thoughts are

651
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
just racing
you know that's a whole other thing too

652
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,440
and it makes you feel upset
and uneasy inside and you can't focus on

653
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,800
anything else
here's another mild version of anxiety i

654
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
talk about all the time you feel like
screaming

655
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,160
you just you feel like screaming i know
it sounds like not a mild one

656
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,359
but it could be a serious version too um
but it's a mild one too when it's not

657
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,760
really serious where you don't scream
but you just feel like screaming you

658
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
feel like going outside and doing that
that's a mild one too

659
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,440
um here's a mild one too here you feel
trapped where

660
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,800
when someone is talking to you so you
feel

661
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,720
trapped when you're like someone
confronts you

662
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,079
someone talks to you and you start
getting a headache and you start to

663
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,400
sweat
and you you feel like your mouth gets

664
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,440
too dry and you feel like your legs are
a little bit weak

665
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,119
and you can't you feel like you almost
turn into like a jellyfish

666
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,640
or a ball of jelly why somebody's
talking to you and you're standing there

667
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,839
and they're talking to you and they're
draining your energy

668
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,800
and you feel trapped that's another form
of anxiety that happens to you out there

669
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,280
too you guys
let's talk about another one here's one

670
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
that you feel like jumping out of your
skin

671
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,599
you feel like a strange tickle inside
your body and you just want to shake it

672
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,319
out you know what i mean like i was just
doing this now

673
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,480
and you feel like you want to jump out
of your skin and at the same time

674
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,160
you're frustrated and you're getting
angry and you want to cry all at once i

675
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,880
don't know if you guys ever experienced
that so many people where

676
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,319
they want to cry they feel angry they
want to jump out of their skin

677
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,599
here's another one right here and i'm
going pretty quick you guys because

678
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
there's so much to cover so you might
want to watch this from the beginning

679
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,079
again
you can't sleep at night so how about

680
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,359
that version
you can't sleep at night where it's hard

681
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,119
to fall asleep because
you don't feel safe you know like when

682
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,440
you go to bed at night you don't feel
safe you're not

683
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,359
excited about tomorrow you're not
inspired about life you're not inspired

684
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,160
about the next day you're stressed out
about

685
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,599
tomorrow and you're dreaming a lot when
you're sleeping and your dreams aren't

686
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,040
happy ones and your dreams aren't really
that peaceful

687
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,960
so you're frustrated as you're dreaming
at night and you wake up but you're not

688
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,000
looking forward to the morning and when
you get up in the morning you kind of

689
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,880
wake up scared or a little spooked and
you feel

690
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
insecure about your day and you feel
insecure about what you're

691
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,280
what you're going through in your life
so that happens too

692
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,400
and just so you know a lot of people
have mixed versions of this that's what

693
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,720
i mean
there's no definitive one

694
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,200
version only anxiety and that's what it
is and everybody has the same thing

695
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,160
no way it is so many different varieties
you can have it mixed

696
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,119
all these different things so let's go
to another one the one where you can't

697
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,000
communicate in your numb
where your hands get sweaty your armpits

698
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,160
get drenched and you get kind of numb
your arms and hands get slightly numb

699
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,119
your temperature fluctuates where you
feel kind of a little bit of chills but

700
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,520
you're not too hot you're too cold
and it's that where you get cold easy

701
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,560
and you kind of shake
here's a moderate form of anxiety here

702
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,520
that i've always seen all these years
and and uh check this one out too hard

703
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,119
to drive in the car
you can't sit in the passenger seat you

704
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,200
feel like jumping kind of out of the car
you feel trapped in the car you want to

705
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,040
get out and the person who's driving you
is somebody that you care about or you

706
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
love
or maybe it's somebody that's annoying

707
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
you and you carpooled with somebody
but and you just feel trapped and

708
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
suffocated in a car
and every time you're like in the car

709
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,160
you're it becomes this phobia
where you feel claustrophobic in the car

710
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,280
you feel like it
gets you get confused you can't handle

711
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
over stimulation
if someone turns the radio on in the car

712
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,440
and they're blasting music if it's not a
song you like

713
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,680
it makes it worse and you get over
stimulated and you get just like oh my

714
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,400
god i can't handle this
somebody said yep all the above

715
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,760
so hammer monique says all the above
yeah totally i

716
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,200
i i believe you 100 and um here's
another moderate version tightness of

717
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,079
the chest
do you get that one too is that the one

718
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,520
you get to the tightness in the chest
right you get tightness in the throat

719
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,200
tightness in the chest um
locked up in the stomach you can get

720
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
locked up in the stomach so that's a
whole other one too

721
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,000
and that kind of chest tightness um that
kind of like

722
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,839
throat tightness tightness in the back
tightness in the shoulders a back of the

723
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,400
head where you get tightness in the back
of the head

724
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,599
that one right there you know you guys
so there's that

725
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,040
and so the reason why there's so many
different versions it's because you get

726
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,760
the viral issues the shingles the
epstein bars that nobody knows about i

727
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,880
talk about and cleanse the heel
and then you get the toxic heavy metals

728
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,160
by the way i have the heavy metal detox
smoothie right here

729
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,240
and you know miranda kerr who is who's
who's on watching tonight she does the

730
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,280
medical medium heavy metal detox movie
that's what she does and um you know i

731
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,480
like putting more orange juice in mine
right there is fresh squeezed orange

732
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,839
juice and
it's so funny because miranda puts his

733
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,599
fresh squeezed orange juice in there too
so anyway um this is on sale by the way

734
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,319
here's another version is you feel
scared

735
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,720
you're feeling scared but you don't know
why and your mind is trying to find out

736
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,800
like why am i so scared about everything
like why am i scared about life

737
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
why am i scared about anything like i i
can't handle news i can't handle someone

738
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,440
delivering
bad news to me which isn't even that bad

739
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,680
i can't handle somebody delivering
good news to me either i can't handle

740
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,720
someone delivering
like any kind of news and there's that

741
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,960
whole thing too and
um that's a hard one for a lot of people

742
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,560
where you just get
spooked easy your heart race is easy

743
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,200
every time
you think of thought and your heart

744
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,880
starts picking up you know and
every time someone's about to deliver

745
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,040
news even if it's good news
you got some like ptsd with your anxiety

746
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,319
all combined
and your your heart races when someone

747
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,560
even gives you good news and you get
scared and you get spooked easy and the

748
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,480
whole bit it's critical to know
what's going on it's why people who have

749
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,720
lyme disease have all these anxiety
symptoms because it's viruses and metals

750
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,960
that's what lyme disease is i've said
this all along and it's why um

751
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,319
that's why it's that that's a reason all
on its own so

752
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,400
plantar fasciitis you guys that's that's
viral and i talk you know i talk about

753
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,520
that in cleanse of heal too
and that's a viral issue that's that's

754
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,599
plantar fasciitis is mostly
epstein-barr i've seen shingles pop in a

755
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,599
little bit too with that one too
so tightness in the stomach that's a

756
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,160
different kind of anxiety i talk about
where it

757
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,359
locks up in your stomach it's
gut-wrenching it feels like your

758
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,079
stomach's flipping
where you feel like your stomach's

759
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,720
flipping there's that kind right there
and that's the whole

760
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,839
tummy problem where i can't eat i can't
eat

761
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,640

762
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,400

really good question right there

763
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,960
i love questions like this um sherry

cleanse
is you improve and you improve and you

768
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,520

a lot of times it's three steps up two

769
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,800
steps back three steps up two steps back
three steps and then you're stronger and

770
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,200
then you're stronger now you're doing a
whole bunch of things you didn't expect

771
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,760
you're even doing
and now you're pushing it hard did you

772
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,559
like what happens with a lot of people
you guys i'm going to lift this right

773
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,559
here for some reason
um

774
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,920
sorry some reason i'm adjusting the
whole thing there and

775
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
there so what happens is that it's three
steps up two steps back

776
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,280
three steps up two steps back and you
you improve

777
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,599
and you improve but it all depends are
you doing the heavy metal detox cleanse

778
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,040
where you're getting the fats low in the
morning are you doing other tools with

779
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,319
it
and and are you doing supplements for

780
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,079
your condition so do you have anxiety
what condition do you have

781
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,200
um um sierra lane with that's the whole
thing so it all depends are you working

782
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,119
with some of the supplement protocols
there's

783
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,559
hundreds and hundreds of different
protocols in the medical medium cleanse

784
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,599
the heel book
and in medical medium information so

785
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,960
what avenue are you customizing for
yourself

786
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,520
to get better and so that your heavy
metal detox smoothie works for you more

787
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,559
and more
and more and each person has metals in

788
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,280
different parts of their body they'll
have metals in different parts

789
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,440
of their brain and in their liver and
there's thousands of different

790
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,400
combinations to think about so really
important to know and

791
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,079
you can customize your own protocol to
get better but how you know

792
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,839
well you know what the same way so many
other people thousands of people know

793
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,480
is they get better and they're doing
their heavy metal detox movie and

794
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,880
they're getting their lives back
so let's talk about another moderate

795
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,760
version right here tightness of the
stomach i talked about before

796
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,520
which makes it hard to breathe shortness
of breath you feel like you can't get a

797
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,760
breath
in you feel like you can't breathe

798
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,520
there's that version
um another moderate version is short

799
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,920
circuit of the brain
brain fog can't think clearly you go

800
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,359
blank
just boom blank and you can't think

801
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,839
clearly
and you got the brain fog you can't

802
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,000
remember what you're you're talking
about

803
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,119
or you're trying to remember and you're
trying to bring it back and you

804
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,319
then you get frustrated and you just
start breaking down

805
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,000
there's that variety where the neurons
are short-circuiting and that that's why

806
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,599
i like the celery juice i don't have a
celery juice with me right now

807
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,720
i think someone said he doesn't even
drink celery juice even though he

808
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,079
what are you kidding how many times have
i showed you guys a glass of celery

809
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,119
juice
and or sipping celery juice um

810
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,160
so and then you know tongue turning
black by the way

811
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,960
that's metals coming out that and you
can have the tongue turning black

812
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,319
when metals are coming out and you can
have the tongue turning black

813
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,599
when you're overloaded with metals
oxidizing

814
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,800
without them coming out it can be both
ways

815
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,640
you can have met you can have the black
tongue which means you're high in heavy

816
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,599
metals
which means your metals are oxidizing

817
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,480
that's the black tongue is
okay and you can also get the black

818
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,920
tongue when you're pulling that stuff
out um i think somebody just asked for

819
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,400
how much the book is 16.99
it's a medical textbook really packed

820
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
with information
amazon.com um get it you know overseas

821
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
and stuff get it free at the library
whatever

822
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,359
as well too so um all right let's let's
keep on going you guys we've got more to

823
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,280
cover
uh let's roll

824
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,520
um a moderate version you wake up scared
your heart rate your heart is racing

825
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,839
so i don't know if you guys have that
where you wake up in the middle of the

826
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,119
night your heart's racing
so you wake up the middle of night your

827
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,800
heart's racing and you're frustrated and
you get up and now you're pacing

828
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,920
um that's a version right there i talk
about and you feel like you're wired

829
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,319
then you can't fall back to sleep
because you're spooked

830
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,280
and then you're spooked about everything
in the middle of the night so there's

831
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,920
that version right there
and there's a version you feel like you

832
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,200
can't be in your own skin i talked about
but a serious version of that where you

833
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,200
feel like you can't be in your own skin
you don't feel safe you don't want to be

834
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,800
alone but yet when somebody's around you
don't want to be with them either and

835
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,000
you're all over the place
that's a version that's really hard to

836
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,599
you guys are so many different
of these so i'm trying to get as much as

837
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,839
i can um
the panic attack the severe versions

838
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,599
where you get the panic attack
your chest gets so tight you feel like

839
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,440
you're dying
you can't walk you can't move sometimes

840
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,319
it puts you right on the floor
where you're laying on the floor and

841
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,359
you're just doubled over and you're
really struggling and suffering

842
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,119
and you're having that massive panic
attack right there that's a

843
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,480
tricky one where you feel like your
lungs don't work you feel like you can't

844
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,599
get a breath in or get a breath out you
feel like your chest is expanding

845
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,040
you feel numb in your extremities where
you're completely numb

846
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,079
everywhere in your body you feel like
your legs are weak

847
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,599
you feel like if you wanted to get up
you couldn't even get up and run

848
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,400
um that's inflamed nerves that's
pathogens and inflamed nerves that's

849
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,680
viruses and inflamed nerves right there
so that's a whole version all on its own

850
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,480
so i'm covering all the things i know i
didn't cover depression some

851
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,160
so the silly siberian said yes yes
it's not in your head by the way and

852
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,000
that's something to know
anxiety is not in your head even if your

853
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,400
thoughts are triggering it
it just means your nerves are so

854
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,280
hypersensitive and inflamed
from the metals and the viral issues

855
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,960
that yes your own thoughts can trigger
it so that's why i love positive

856
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,960
thoughts i love all that
of course god we need that but the point

857
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,000
is
is i've seen anxiety so bad positive

858
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,359
thoughts trigger it
that's how inflamed your nerves can get

859
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,119
this is all medical medium information
can't get this information anywhere else

860
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,400
it's why the medical medium community
grew so big over the last 35

861
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,640
plus years um for the chronically ill
for the chronically ill it's the largest

862
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,359
community and safe space for the
chronically ill if you're new here

863
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,640
so there's all kinds of different things
where that was the one i was talking

864
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,680
about where stressful thoughts can
actually make it worse

865
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,280
anything stressful because your nerves
are already inflamed

866
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,400
they're already lit up your phrenic
nerves your

867
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,040
your vagus nerve is already a hot spot
because it's inflamed from toxic heavy

868
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,319
metals
it's inflamed from pathogens and viruses

869
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,960
like the
like how i described earlier so when

870
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,839
those nerves are inflamed like that all
you gotta do is get jarred

871
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,200
all you need is some bad news all you
need is to think bad thoughts all you

872
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,839
need is to think good thoughts and
you're just now you're just feeling

873
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,640
anxiety you can't
and then you're trying to tell yourself

874
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,400
i'm okay i'm okay um or
i don't know if i'm dying and and now

875
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,880
you're at like different doctor's
offices looking for different

876
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
medications it's really difficult for so
many people

877
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,160
another version of of anxiety is you're
nauseous and you can't eat you just

878
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,079
can't get food down you're so nauseous
you can't get food down your family

879
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,319
members don't understand
nobody gets it where you know they you

880
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,119
got an eating disorder you got an eating
disorder

881
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,599
you know what's wrong with you you can't
eat meanwhile anxiety is what it is

882
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,359
um trisha marie 75 oh my god
you are explaining this perfectly that

883
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:31,680
is what happened to me
with the numbness afterwards um i'm

884
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,280
sorry you're going through that
i'm sorry you went through that it's it

885
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,160
breaks my heart to know that
like i care about people you know and

886
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,280
that's the whole thing and the more and
more i care about people and the more

887
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
and more
i want you guys better the more flack i

888
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,040
get out there you guys wouldn't believe
how it goes the more and more people

889
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,000
want to stomp me out and silence me it's
crazy

890
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,640
because you're really not allowed to get
people better you're just supposed to

891
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,599
play this game maybe some food science
game or write some

892
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,040
books that don't get anybody anywhere in
health and regurgitated

893
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,920
information you pass around over and
over again you're not allowed to get

894
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
people better and medical medium
information actually

895
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,359
gets people better and let me tell you
something

896
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,640
there's some bad people in the world
that don't want people healing

897
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,760
you know in the industries and medical
media information has saved

898
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,040
countless lives already and it pains me
to know that you actually went through

899
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,799
that that you're go you you went through
those symptoms and you suffered like

900
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,960
that
and the more and more i care and the

901
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,920
more and more i fight for you guys and
fight for the underdog and

902
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,520
in all that the more and more bs gets
put out there

903
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,359
stories aren't real this and that
happens paid trolls go on

904
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,520
oh my god the pay trolls the industries
but you know amp up those paid trolls 24

905
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,680
7. it's incredible
and they got every trick in the book

906
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,720
like oh i tried medical medium and it
didn't work oh sure

907
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,440
you tried it you tried the hundreds of
protocols you locked down your

908
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,880
customized protocol
sure you read the book but by the way

909
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,000
you guys over 200 symptoms and
conditions in here

910
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and um you guys i love fighting for you
guys and i'll tell you why

911
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,280
okay because when i'm when i
wake up in the morning and i know so

912
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,440
many of you guys are suffering out there
and you've been through hell and back

913
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,480
and i know you can rise out of those
ashes

914
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,480
i know you can rise out of the ashes and
heal and move forward

915
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,839
and you know and i'm never gonna stop
fighting for you guys

916
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,640
because i know that you've been
struggling and suffering and people with

917
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,240
anxiety
man they're not treated good they're not

918
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,040
treated good
and i've seen that over and over and

919
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,319
over again
and you guys i'm going to cover more in

920
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,880
depression
one thing about depression i'll cover a

921
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,119
couple of minutes of depression though
with depression is the toxic heavy

922
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,079
metals play a really large role in
depression

923
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,799
and you got to get the metals out
because when the neurons are saturated

924
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:51,599
with toxic heavy metals
it weighs down the electrical impulse to

925
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,520
the point where your neurotransmitters
start to dehydrate they start to not get

926
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,040
used properly they don't ignite the
neurons

927
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,160
don't work right because electrical
impulses are hitting metal

928
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,680
and we get that deep depression and
everything and and all that and i'm

929
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,240
going to cover you know i'm going to go
