1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
we are

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,919
everybody is different

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,840
but not like they think

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,840
everybody is different this is really

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,200
important to talk about today

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,199
every single person is different

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,439
let's talk about why

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
everyone's soul is different

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,480
if your soul

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,320
experiences a hardship

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,079
betrayal someone stabs you in the back

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,000
someone lets you down somebody breaks

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
your trust

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
something terrible happening in the

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,280
world right

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,719
exactly

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
tragedies

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,520
anything like that

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
if your soul

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,840
experiences that

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,879
that's what makes you different

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,320
than someone else

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,640
right

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,680
because your soul is unique to begin

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
with

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
and then the experiences

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
that your soul goes through are

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
different say it's a breakup say it's a

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
relationship

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,080
right say you were cheated on

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
how many people were cheated on

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,119
right

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
how many people were betrayed how many

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,680
people had their trust break

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,400
trust is a big one that's a big one

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,360
so many people go through so much with

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
trust and betrayal and hardship and then

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
we get sick

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
we get sick

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
and we don't come out of our sickness we

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
don't come out of those physical

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
symptoms so we got these neurological

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
symptoms and we don't come out of it

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
it's like wait a minute i've been to my

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,520
second doctor i've been to my third

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
doctor now i've been to my neurologist

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,119
now i'm going to another doctor and then

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
a pulmonologist and then i'm going to

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
another internist

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
and he's writing out more scripts to see

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,920
other doctors and rheumatologists i'm

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,399
going to now

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,079
and we lose trust we lose trust in

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
everything we lose trust in our body we

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
lose trust in the people around us we

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,520
lose trust in

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
what's happening in our world we lose

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
trust

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
we thought we were safe and then we're

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,280
not safe

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,959
we get let down all the time

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
and then we get hit with anxiety and

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
depression and everybody's anxiety and

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
depression

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,440
is different

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
is different anxiety depression is

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,120
connected to the soul not just

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
physically

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,440
and everybody's physical reason for

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
anxiety depression is different than

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
another person too

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,040
it makes us all different

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,519
it does

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,360
but what isn't different is your heart

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
beats

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
and it has a function

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,879
and that's where we're the same on the

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,760
same as you you're the same as me

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,599
that's when it's not really

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,319
an individual thing where no no no no

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,200
your heart is different

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,920
our hearts are meant to beat and pump

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,080
blood they're meant to pull blood

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,080
up through the liver they're meant to

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,159
have blood travel through the body and

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
pump through the body

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,840
our hearts are spreading oxygen around

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,840
through our blood our hearts are working

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
the same they're supposed to work

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
they're same and then all of a sudden

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,799
someone's heart

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,680
goes awry and someone's heart goes amiss

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,720
and somebody's heart has a problem

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
but that's where we're different

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
because there's something that could be

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
different with that person that made

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
their heart not work right that's

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,480
different than another person where

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,200
their hearts doing something different

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
but what is the same is the heart

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,319
function we're supposed to function the

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,720
same way

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,360
you know how else we're the same

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
we're the same because of swallowing

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,159
we're supposed to be able to chew our

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,799
food and swallow right

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
well that's what we're supposed to do

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,200
our brain

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
sends a message

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,400
okay

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,519
our vagus nerves are getting messages

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
and then we're swallowing

113
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,560
right

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
but if something goes wrong inside the

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
brain

116
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
that's when it gets different that

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,000
person can't swallow because something's

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,080
wrong inside the brain

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
yet we're all the same with the

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,759
functions

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,960
we're supposed to have two legs

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,560
and then someone loses a leg

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
that's a dif that's what makes them

124
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,960
different but we're supposed to have

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,720
these bodily functions you're supposed

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,120
to be able to go to bathroom like

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
everybody else

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
okay

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,280
our stomach is supposed to hold food

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,000
every single person's stomach on the

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,000
planet is supposed to hold food

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
that's what makes us the same

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
right

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,280
that's what makes us the same our

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
stomach is supposed to hold food we eat

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
our food we're supposed to chew our food

137
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,880
but when something goes wrong

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,400
and neurologically we can't chew anymore

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
or

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,720
we have gastroparesis

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
because of a problem

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,199
and that's what makes us different right

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,199
but we're all supposed to function the

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,840
same your pancreas does the same thing

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
my pancreas does same thing you guys

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
your heart does the same thing my heart

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
does your liver does the same thing my

148
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
liver does

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
words we're lit our livers are doing the

150
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,960
same thing

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
unless something gets in your liver

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,360
and impedes it

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
if something impedes your liver

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
that's what changes that's what makes us

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
different

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,639
our physical functions are all supposed

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,759
to be the same your liver is not

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
supposed to do something different than

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
my liver no way

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,440
it's the suppo it's supposed to do the

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
same thing your kidneys are not

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
your kidneys are supposed to do

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,479
something entirely than my kidneys so

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
entirely different so all of our kidneys

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
are supposed to do something different

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,039
than everybody else's kidneys that's not

167
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
how it works your kidneys are supposed

168
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,400
to do the same thing

169
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,240
someone else's kidneys are supposed to

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
do and every other person on the planet

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
and the billions of people that are on

172
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
planet earth your kidneys are supposed

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,039
to function the same they have the same

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,120
role in the same job

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
there's no

176
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,800
individual there's no

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,840
bio

178
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,840
individual with that

179
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
but then

180
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,720
your colon is supposed to work the same

181
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,880
as my colon your colon is supposed to

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
work the same as somebody else's colon

183
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
they're supposed to work the same

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
they are

185
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
michelle l you're right except many

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
women are different that's so true

187
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,960
exactly

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,880
peristaltic action is supposed to happen

189
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,120
for everybody so all the billions of

190
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
people on planet earth peristaltic

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,199
action is supposed to be the same it's

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
supposed to work the same

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,000
okay

194
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,240
you eat your food your vagus nerves send

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,599
a message to your intestinal tract your

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,400
intestinal tract twists like this and

197
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,919
then your food starts moving along

198
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,080
because your intestinal tract is

199
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
twisting it's supposed to do the same

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
thing everybody else does everybody down

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,000
the street everybody down the block

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
everybody in another state everybody in

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,160
another country everybody on the planet

204
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
is supposed to have the same function

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,280
it's the vagus nerves receiving a

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,599
message boom via neurons neurons send

207
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
that message to your vagus nerves boom

208
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
vagus nerves go into your intestinal

209
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
tract and all around your colon and it

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
makes it go

211
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,080
right right

212
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,919
like the sound effects

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
that's what it's supposed to do for

214
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,120
everyone you're no different than that

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,919
person i'm no different than you i'm no

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,240
different than that other person see

217
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,800
it's all the same

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
right there unless

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,240
something goes wrong

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,879
unless now you got a bacteria like

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,919
streptococcus that's inflaming or eating

222
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,840
away at your intestinal lining or you've

223
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,879
got something that's eating away the e

224
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,280
coli that's eating away at your colon

225
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,039
lining and now you got diverticulosis

226
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
and now you've got inflammation now

227
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,080
you've got problems or if a virus eats

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
away at the lining of your in your colon

229
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
and now you've got colitis so it's a

230
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
shingles virus causing colitis that's

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,279
what starts making us different that's

232
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,480
what is making us different right there

233
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,800
your colon is supposed to work

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
exactly umakali

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
i see people saying that we're all

236
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,000
different but all of us have the same

237
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,160
anatomy and physiology what's different

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,880
is what we've been exposed to like

239
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,959
toxins and bugs

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,600
exactly 100

241
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,000
right that's exactly it

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,519
so what makes us different

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
is those things you know what else makes

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
this the same

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,839
blood

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,600
we all have blood in us

247
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,560
and when you take too much blood out

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,519
like

249
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,680
what they did to the lyme community

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
for 40 years

251
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,720
i can't tell you how many people who

252
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,839
died that didn't need to die from lyme

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
disease

254
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
because they were bled to death at their

255
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,120
doctor's offices let's take another 30

256
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
vials let's take another 20 miles let's

257
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,880
take another 40 vials i can't tell you

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,200
how many people lost their lives from

259
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,760
getting too much blood taken

260
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,839
cancer people who had a fighting chance

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
to recover from cancer had the blood

262
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,200
drained out of them so they had no more

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
immune system to fight the cancer and

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,720
then they died earlier

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,800
lyme disease multiple sclerosis als any

266
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
any kind of illness really

267
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,120
i've seen people with

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
chronic fatigue syndrome die because

269
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,600
they were bled to death

270
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,279
because we all have blood

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
and here's the difference about the

272
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,680
survival of somebody with lyme disease

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
or someone with chronic fatigue syndrome

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,600
me the difference is how much blood did

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,959
someone else get taken by their doctors

276
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
versus somebody else that got blood

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
taken one other doctor took only 12

278
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
vials from their patient every time they

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
came in which is still bad enough

280
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,880
another doctor took 30 vials

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
that patient eventually died

282
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
that made that situation different but

283
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,640
the blood

284
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,640
we all have

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,480
our souls are unique

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
that's for sure

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
no soul is the same

288
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,600
no soul is the same but physically our

289
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,079
bodies are supposed to function the same

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,160
the organs function the same your brain

291
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,160
is supposed to function the same

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,240
all these things

293
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,079
are supposed to function the same your

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,480
adrenals are supposed to do the same

295
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
thing someone else's adrenals do okay

296
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
you need adrenaline for every single

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
function in your life you need

298
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
adrenaline when you go to bathroom you

299
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,040
need adrenaline when you say hi to

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
somebody

301
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
do you know that your adrenals actually

302
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
do a little squirt when you meet

303
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
somebody

304
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
do you know that hey how are you hey

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,200
nice to meet you great to meet you hey

306
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
how you doing yeah hey great to meet you

307
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
your adrenals go bam

308
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
bam

309
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,560
just like that every single person who

310
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
comes across somebody else and says hi

311
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,720
to them or meets them in that instant

312
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,240
their adrenals go

313
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
and shoot out a little bit of adrenaline

314
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
it doesn't matter if you're nervous or

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
not when you're meeting that person

316
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,839
that's what happens

317
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
every single person that goes to their

318
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
doctor's appointment same thing their

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,839
adrenals go

320
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
from white coat

321
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
syndrome right there

322
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
right everybody you go to the dentist

323
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
office and they're about you know you go

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
in the dentist office and they're

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,720
looking in your mouth and everything

326
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
your adrenals are starting to go up a

327
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
little bit

328
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,760
you go take a shower your adrenals are

329
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
going you go to the bathroom it takes

330
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,200
adrenaline to go to the bathroom

331
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
everybody's adrenals do the same thing

332
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
they all do that they all release

333
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
adrenaline when we go through all these

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
different experiences right

335
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,200
it's how it works

336
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,639
now our souls have

337
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
experiences that come from before this

338
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
physical body by the way that we don't

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
tap into that we don't we don't connect

340
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
with

341
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
but our soul's got experiences from this

342
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,160
lifetime too makes us different

343
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,320
the soul that we that that we enter this

344
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,320
earth with

345
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
has

346
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,600
experiences which make it unique so our

347
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,360
souls are so unique they are

348
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
what makes them really unique it's

349
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
interesting because you can tell

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
somebody hey

351
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,639
if you want to heal this is what you

352
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,120
need to do but their soul might be like

353
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,560
i don't want to do that

354
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,800
i'm going to go do something else so

355
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
that's their soul is just that's the way

356
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,240
their soul is built

357
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
like souls also help us make decisions

358
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
they help us make bad decisions too in

359
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
the world too

360
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,839
souls do a lot our soul is different

361
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,079
everybody's soul is unique why would you

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,399
take a right when you could take a left

363
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,560
no you should have gone left

364
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,800
you know up the mountain instead of

365
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,079
right down the hill

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,160
or you should have done this you should

367
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,600
have did the soul just plays a role in

368
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
so many different decisions we make

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,240
we're so unique because of that our soul

370
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
picks our hobbies

371
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,440
what we like what we like to do the kind

372
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
of fun we like to have right some people

373
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
don't like to sit on the beach and other

374
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,240
people love the beach some people like

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,279
to be on boats some people hate to be on

376
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,959
boats that's the soul right there

377
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,880
that's the soul some people like to

378
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,240
watch a sunset people like to only watch

379
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,320

381
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000

popcorn some people hate popcorn

386
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,000
whatever it is the soul does play a role

387
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,920
in so many different aspects of our life

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
but our physical body

389
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,519
our physical body

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,120
becomes really different when you get

391
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
pesticide

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
sprayed on you from your neighbor when

393
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,920
you're breathing in scented candles that

394
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
you don't realize are highly poisonous

395
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
when you're

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
getting

397
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
heavy metals from certain

398
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
pharmaceuticals and that's another thing

399
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,440
that makes her physical body different

400
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,839
pharmaceuticals that can make her

401
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
physical body different

402
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,800
someone can be on a lot of

403
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
antidepressants a lot of anti-anxiety

404
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
meds somebody can be on a lot of

405
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
different medications and it builds up

406
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
and it builds up a lot of painkillers

407
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
and it builds up and it builds up

408
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,839
sleeping pills and it builds up right

409
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,040
the whole bit and it builds up inside

410
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,800
their liver and it builds up inside

411
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,639
their organs and their kidneys and now

412
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,560
they have a problem but that's what

413
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,880
makes them different than somebody else

414
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,040
who wasn't on all those medications it

415
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,199
made them physically different that's

416
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,519
the whole point what does somebody have

417
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,040
what kind of bag of tricks bag of goods

418
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
do they have inside their body what's

419
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,079
sitting inside their liver what's

420
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
sitting inside the kidneys what's inside

421
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,639
their brain how many metals are inside

422
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
their brain

423
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,320
that determines too

424
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,360
on how somebody feels julia says i will

425
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,360
have to rewatch this video tomorrow

426
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
you guys were alive right now

427
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,760
so

428
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,880
wellness is important because your

429
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,399
depression can be different than

430
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,839
somebody else's depression you see how

431
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
it works your anxiety is different than

432
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,560
somebody else's anxiety

433
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
everybody has

434
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,839
a different situation of what's

435
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,759
happening inside of them both both

436
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,199
toxicity levels and both pathogenic

437
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
levels that are inside their body that

438
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,320
determines

439
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:42,000
which way things are gonna go

440
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,160
definitely which way things are gonna go

441
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
and all that is important to keep in

442
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
mind

443
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,920
so

444
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
one thing we have to always remember

445
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
though okay

446
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,600
it's your experience is different than

447
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
someone else's experience emotionally

448
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,199
if you've been let down if you've been

449
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,839
betrayed if you've had a hard time if

450
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,000
something happened in your life man

451
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,279
only you know

452
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,880
only you know what that's like

453
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
something terrible happened something

454
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
going on so you're under pressure

455
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
whatever it is something you were peer

456
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,920
pressured into doing maybe something

457
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,880
that's gone wrong in your life maybe

458
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,320
some hardships maybe some struggles

459
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,399
maybe some losses you lost some serious

460
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,160
things that mattered in your life

461
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,120
whatever that could be a loved one of

462
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,639
course which we don't ever want to lose

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,279
or a friend

464
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,680
or something that was important to

465
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
your existence

466
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,160
your resources whatever it is we lose it

467
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
plays a role in our soul and it shapes

468
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,839
our soul and it changes our soul right

469
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
there and no one can touch that man

470
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,959
that's so

471
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,440
unique to part of your soul your

472
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,000
experiences of what you've been through

473
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
the letdowns you've had the broken trust

474
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,079
any of that

475
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,639
the struggles emotional struggles

476
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,720
all that's tied into the soul so deep

477
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,240
and nobody could touch that nobody can

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
go near that because you know what

479
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,199
that's you that's yours that's your

480
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,160
individual experience is right there

481
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,079
that's what those are

482
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,079
and they're powerful

483
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:19,679
they're valuable too really valuable

484
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,360
life is short here on planet earth boom

485
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,439
short

486
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,839
that's right

487
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,480
you think 50 years 60 years 70 80 years

488
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,480
90 years

489
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,360
i think that's a long time

490
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
gone

491
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
that's it

492
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,120
real fast

493
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,559
life is real short

494
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,160
it really is i get it when you when

495
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
you're 20 years older you're 22 years

496
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
old you're 23 years old or something

497
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,799
like that you think man you think life

498
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,320
is forever you think you're gonna live

499
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
forever you think

500
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,200
life here

501
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,039
is like

502
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,280
you know you'll be here for a thousand

503
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,000
years

504
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,360
when you're 19 years old or 25 you're 28

505
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
years old you might think you're here

506
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
for a thousand years

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,360
until you reach 30 and you start going

508
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
30 what the heck is that 30 i'm now i'm

509
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
30.

510
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,280
and it starts to kind of almost shift a

511
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
little for a lot of people but not quite

512
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,919
yet

513
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,799
life goes by

514
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,240
really really quick

515
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,240
it's a blip of time

516
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
and our soul

517
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
is still

518
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
there

519
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
it doesn't die

520
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,120
we lose our physical bodies and that's

521
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,840
the same thing we all have in common

522
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,440
we're all the same

523
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,480
every last one of us is all the same

524
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,799
we breathe

525
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,799
we live and eventually we die

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,400
we leave

527
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,080
every last one of us you ever look back

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,080
at the old antique photos

529
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,679
go in a bookstore and you're looking

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
through books and you see some old book

531
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
and the book is all these people and

532
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
they're all sitting there by a farm and

533
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,400
they're all like this with some rakes

534
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,679
and shovels and they're just wearing

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,160
these strange clothes right

536
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,440
and it's black and white photos and it's

537
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,720
like 1919 they're all gone

538
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
they're all gone like that

539
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,320
we're all the same

540
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
we're all the same

541
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,919
all of us

542
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,000
every last one of us on this earth were

543
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,440
the same

544
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,039
every last one of us or sisters or

545
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,559
brothers were all the same big family

546
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:46,480
and we leave here and it goes quick

547
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,000
but what makes us different is our soul

548
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,559
and

549
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,559
physical experiences that change the way

550
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,880
your bodies function through this ride

551
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
right

552
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,159
thing is about

553
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,919
if you ever worry about leaving this

554
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,400
place down the road always remember your

555
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,240
soul lives on forever

556
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,799
your soul lives on forever and you're

557
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,799
aware

558
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,760
you're aware

559
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
your soul

560
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,440
has all the information

561
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,520
it's an embodiment all on its own

562
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,840
and it never dies

563
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,840
ever

564
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,520
anything you do good here

565
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,200
anything the smallest little thing the

566
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,720
smallest deed whatever it is

567
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,919
your soul gets to carry that with you

568
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,919
you tell somebody hey

569
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,240

570
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,679

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,000
boom that's like gets in your soul

572
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,400

anything or you help them with anything

574
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
you help somebody across the street you

575
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,760
help somebody

576
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,080
go in front of you in a line

577
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
whatever it is you pick something off

578
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,480
the ground in the grocery store that

579
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,039
someone just dropped she's he's the

580
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,159
smallest things the smallest things

581
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:23,120
the tiniest things

582
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,799
save a moth a moth flew into the house

583
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,039
and you grab it

584
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,520
and you cup it like this and it's just a

585
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,600
moth for god's sakes and you take them

586
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,760
off and you let them moth out and you

587
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,280
watch that ball fly away and maybe that

588
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,600
moth only has a year or season in it

589
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,919
but you let it go when something happens

590
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,200
inside your soul and you take that with

591
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
you

592
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,919
that's what powers our soul that's what

593
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,919
powers our soul

594
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,360
when it comes down to our physical

595
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,720
problems though

596
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,880
and our physical

597
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,960
abilities and all that that change is

598
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
really fast you get some heavy metals in

599
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
the brain which i want to do a heavy

600
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
metal detox cleanse

601
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
challenge sometime i don't know when but

602
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
i want to focus on it because metals are

603
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,600
so critical

604
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,240
you get metals of the brain copper

605
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,760
aluminum mercury changes everything and

606
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
the next thing you know it got the brain

607
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,840
fog and the focus and concentration

608
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,360
problems depression anxiety meaning

609
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,280
mysterious depression anxiety you might

610
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,880
have anxiety because of what's happening

611
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
in the world the unjust

612
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,039
the unjust evils that are happening in

613
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
this world and that's a different kind

614
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,840
of anxiety or the unjust evils that are

615
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,840
causing depression right now

616
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,480
i've always said evils on this planet

617
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,799
there are evil evil demonic people on

618
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
this planet that have no respect for

619
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,960
human life i've always said that all

620
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
these years

621
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,440
and

622
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
when that interferes with any of our

623
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,080
lives on any scale whatsoever can create

624
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
some depression anxiety because it hits

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,760
the emotional centers of the brain and

626
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,200
then we get injured and i talked about

627
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,240
that and cleanse the heel a little bit

628
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,400
about that emotional injury in our brain

629
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,840
and how it works we get a little scar

630
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
tissue on the brain and that makes you

631
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
different right there if you're somebody

632
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
that experienced a hardship

633
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,840
and that emotional center of the brain

634
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,679
got whacked and hit hard then then that

635
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,400
right there determines hey you got that

636
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,919
injury that's specific to you and now

637
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,679
you have a depression that's different

638
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,240
than somebody else's depression no one's

639
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,840
depression is exactly the same metals

640
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
can be in a different part of the brain

641
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
than somebody else and an emotional

642
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,720
experience can be in a different part

643
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,360
the emotional centers of the brain than

644
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
somebody else

645
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,280
and everybody has a different

646
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,280
situation going on

647
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,799
what i noticed about some people out

648
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,480
there that want to destroy

649
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,080
the futures of people who need their

650
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
health back

651
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,760
what i notice is

652
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,400
some people will browse the brass

653
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,400
through medical medium information

654
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
and they'll pick and choose some things

655
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
out of medical medium they won't

656
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
understand the message from medical

657
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,240
medium information they don't understand

658
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,480
that i'm a messenger i'm nobody

659
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,480
i'm nobody

660
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,840
nobody that's what i am

661
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,760
people say oh medical medium i'm nothing

662
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,039
nothing i'm a messenger

663
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,600
i'll be here today gone tomorrow

664
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,559
down the road but what will be here will

665
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,480
be the information that i messaged out

666
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,360
from above

667
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,360
that information will be here

668
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,679
it'll be there to speak in a light in

669
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,840
hopes to save more lives

670
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,840
in hopes to save more lives

671
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
because i'm just a messenger in the

672
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,240
moment in this time in history so i can

673
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,320
deliver this information from above

674
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
i'm nothing special

675
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
for some reason

676
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,080
i was given the ability to hear

677
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,720
and

678
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,039
survive

679
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
that

680
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,880
torture of hearing a voice

681
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,799
and bringing information that's

682
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,520
different than any other information out

683
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,520
there in health

684
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,360
and

685
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,120
i think it angers a lot of people

686
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,799
because a lot of people see that medical

687
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,480
meme information is the only information

688
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,000
that's different

689
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,520
and all the other information in

690
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
alternative health

691
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,159
is the same

692
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,760
it parrots the same

693
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,240
it's like all the same stuff

694
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,440
then medical medium information is

695
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,840
different

696
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,320
because it's different

697
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,679
and it's healed so many people it's a

698
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,880
threat

699
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,360
it's a great threat to the industry

700
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,799
then the industry likes to

701
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,440
come up with all kinds of different

702
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,440
tactics

703
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,279
people need to understand that

704
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,360
as a messenger it's not about the

705
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,679
anthony williams show if it was going to

706
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,200
be the anthony williams show

707
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,480
then i would have just made it the

708
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,159
anthony williams show and did selfies 24

709
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320

710
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,000

too and the anthony williams show

719
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,320
if it was going to be about the anthony

720
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,840
williams show i would have done a bunch

721
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,440
of different tv show series like i've

722
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,720
been asked to do and i'm like well you

know what yeah i want to get the

724
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,679
information out there but i don't want

725
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,039
to make it about the anthony williams

726
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,919
show because i'm a messenger

727
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,279
i'm not supposed to be a star of any

728
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,240
kind

729
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,600
i'm not supposed to be

730
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,080
anyone

731
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,840
i'm supposed to be nothing

732
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,640
but yet a voice for the chronically ill

733
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
a voice for spirit of compassion

734
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,279
so i can deliver the message out to

735
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,240
people so they

736
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,000

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,080
the review is this thank god for the

758
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,760
information in this book it has

759
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,320
literally saved my life i had been to 21

760
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,799
doctors

761
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,799
21 doctors

762
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,440
i get it when you're 20 years old and

763
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,440
you just have a bellyache once in a

764
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,120
while a little bit uploading which is

765
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,279
still not good

766
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
maybe a tiny bit of acne

767
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,320
maybe a little bit of fatigue and you

768
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,520
run around to your functional medicine

769
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,679
doctors and the functional medicine

770
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,679
doctor says oh your gut dysbiosis is

771
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,640
happening and you need a little this and

772
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,960
try a little of that you think you got

773
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,279
it all down and then you go and you put

774
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,120
a post out

775
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,399
thinking that you have everything down

776
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,159
right

777
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,399
but when you're somebody that's been to

778
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,559
21 doctors and you're really sick and

779
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,159
you're really ill that's what medical

780
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,320
medium information has been for all

781
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
these years

782
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,399
so thank god for the information in this

783
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,360
book it has literally saved my life i

784
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,760
have been to 21 doctors prior to finding

785
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,600
the books written by anthony williams it

786
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,880
was his celery juice that first peaked

787
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,840
my curiosity so i went to

788
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,440
medicalmedium.com to research when

789
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,840
literally in the in the first two

790
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,679
paragraphs on his home page at the time

791
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,480
all the answers i had been looking for

792
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,880
fell into place and made perfect sense i

793
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,600
found that no wonder doctors couldn't

794
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,360
heal arthritis because there is no such

795
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,760
thing as autoimmune

796
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,960
my health problems were there because of

797
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,440
a virus not because my immune system was

798
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,120
attacking me and getting

799
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,120
into attacking me right

800
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,760
and the review goes on and on

801
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,039
but it's somebody who's been to 21

802
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
doctors

803
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
and the thing about medical medium

804
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,799
information i was always a messenger to

805
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
just make sure that hey

806
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,559
if you're in that position you got a

807
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
shot now you know here here it is so it

808
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,159
wasn't supposed to be the anthony

809
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,919
williams show

810
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,440
it was supposed to be

811
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,159
i'm a messenger i'm nobody

812
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,919
i just have to make sure people have an

813
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,520
opportunity get that information

814
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,440
bring it down

815
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,039
be able to voice it

816
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,120
and be able to back up the chronically

817
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,720
ill

818
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,370
and make sure that i'm a voice for the

819
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,960
chronically ill too

820
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,640
[Music]

821
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
the other day

822
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,440
someone brought up bio

823
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,440
individual okay

824
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,320
medical medium they said

825
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,760
does all these things wrong

826
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,600
and they said medical medium does all

827
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
these things wrong because their medical

828
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,279
medium information is different than any

829
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,640
other information in

830
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,960
the health field

831
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,919
yeah it's different it's geared to save

832
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,320
lives

833
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,960
it's there for when you see 21 doctors

834
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,360
and 25 doctors 21 doctors that's a small

835
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,360
amount of doctors

836
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,559
medical medium information has been here

837
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,640
for people who've seen 50 doctors

838
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,640
actually a hundred doctors

839
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,840
one person

840
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,600
said they went to 400 doctors in 20

841
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,799
years

842
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,640
before medical medium information

843
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,760
not only gave them a fighting chance but

844
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,159
reversed their problems

845
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,399
uma says i've seen people use mm info to

846
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,279
heal and then turn against mm and go

847
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,840
sell zeolite or alkaline water machines

848
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,679
absolutely in fact the sabotages

849
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,000
sabotage on the medical mean community

850
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,360
are people very angry

851
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,360
because

852
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,519
medical medium healed them and then they

853
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
wanted to sell their alkaline ionizer

854
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,120
water machine

855
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,440
medical medium doesn't support ionizer

856
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,279
water machines because

857
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,320
that will make you neurologically sick

858
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,320
the plates inside the machines

859
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,200
they start to decompose you don't see it

860
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,200
decomposing but they do they oxidize

861
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,320
and you get sick and twisted in the

862
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,240
brain from alkaline as your water water

863
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,840
my job is to protect the chronically ill

864
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,640
but what that did was create a bunch of

865
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,640
enemies so that the enemies that sell

866
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,559
the machines start getting people to

867
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,840
post

868
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,519
and then you see a bunch of people that

869
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
don't know any of this that go whoa i'm

870
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,200
not going to go near medical medium then

871
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,960
i won't look at his book i i'll go

872
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,919
somewhere else

873
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
that's a mark on your soul man

874
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,360
when you do evil things like that and

875
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,960
you turn people a direction that they

876
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,320
could have gotten help and you turn them

877
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,120
away from that

878
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,919
some evil intentions

879
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,840
that stays in the soul you do evil crap

880
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,279
that stays in your soul

881
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,279
for eternity

882
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
so

883
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,880
so what happens is it brings on a whole

884
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,600
bunch of hit jobs and hit post and stuff

885
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,559
like that right so let's just let's just

886
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,480
read one that came out pretty recently

887
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,360
this post is titled what does the

888
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,880
medical medium get wrong

889
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,360
we'd love to hear what medical medium

890
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,799
gets wrong this is interesting

891
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,360
right

892
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,760
okay let's just read one of these things

893
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,799
the body needs acidity too much

894
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,240
alkalinity can cause more infections low

895
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,320
hcl and poor mitochondrial health well

896
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,440
that doesn't really sum up too much

897
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,679
right there

898
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,200
so medical medium gets what wrong kind

899
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,399
of confused with just that one all on

900
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
its own

901
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,720
so this person is saying

902
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,039
the body needs acidity here's the

903
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,720
problem everybody's so darn acidic

904
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,559
they're losing their bodies

905
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
this person is an amateur i guess and

906
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,679
they just don't know this

907
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,960
we're so acidic we get osteopenia

908
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,000
osteoporosis spinal stenosis

909
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,960
we're so acidic that our brain bathes in

910
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,640
acid

911
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:34,559
and atrophies as the ears go on

912
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,559
we're so acidic that we burn out our hcl

913
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,159
our our own hydrochloric acid and

914
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,679
stomach glands we're so acidic

915
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,760
that we ruin

916
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,679
the other acidity

917
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,200
which is hcl

918
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,519
so this person says the body needs

919
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,640
acidity oh it does actually we're

920
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,120
desperate to get out of acidosis

921
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,960
for somebody to say this and say what

922
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,159
medical what the does the medical medium

923
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,519
get wrong so they're trying to correct

924
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,679
me with this one they're saying the body

925
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,760
needs acidity medical medium

926
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,960
too much alkalinity

927
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,799
do you know how hard it is to get

928
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,960
alkaline

929
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,560
you have to be eating leafy greens every

930
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,720
single day you've got to be doing your

931
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,800
celery juice you've got to be cautious

932
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,159
on you got to keep dairy out of your

933
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,679
diet right

934
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,760
you got you got to watch out for

935
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,399
chemical poisons and toxins it's not

936
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,440
easy to get alkaline but this person's

937
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,919
acting like

938
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,560
alkalinity is like easy to get to and

939
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,639
that we need to be acidic instead

940
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,440
if you take this person's advice it's a

941
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,599
nightmare how's anybody gonna heal let's

942
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,639
move on to another one

943
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,599
okay well this is a fun one right here

944
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,760
veganism has a time and place just like

945
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,280
all other therapeutic diets so what this

946
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,599
person is saying

947
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,760
is that i must be straight vegan and

948
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
only vegan and that's all i ever support

949
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,960
is vegan

950
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,280
let's just clear this up for a little

951
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,200
bit right now

952
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
do you know why the vegans don't like

953
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,520
medical medium out there the the staunch

954
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,760
veganism world

955
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,599
because i support animal protein eaters

956
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,520
did you know

957
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,160
that the plant-based movement and the

958
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
vegan movement despises anthony william

959
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:19,839
the medical medium because i will not

960
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,320
solely and solely only support vegans

961
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,400
i'm hated by the vegans yes i know so

962
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
many of you guys are vegan but the vegan

963
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,800
movement you guys know the vegan

964
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,880
movement hates medical medium because i

965
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,880
don't sit there and talk about all the

966
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,320
vegan talking points and the vegan

967
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,280
propaganda and i'm not just 100

968
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,599
i the medical medium platform or

969
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,079
community or the medical medium

970
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,480
information supports all walks of life

971
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,960
that eat all kinds of different ways

972
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,480
there are animal protein people here

973
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,160
there are plant-based people here

974
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,119
there's macrobiotic people here there's

975
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,599
vegetarians here there's people that eat

976
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,400
dirt there's people that eat animals

977
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,640
there's people that eat just blueberries

978
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,839
there's people from all walks of life

979
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,599
here

980
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,040
but this person puts out in their posts

981
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,920
to make sure they twist the minds of

982
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,839
others

983
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,760
that veganism has a time in place just

984
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,280
like all other therapeutic diets so

985
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
anthony williams

986
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
must have it wrong then because he must

987
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,320
be just a one size fits all just vegan

988
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,839
because that's what they're claiming so

989
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,079
let's move on to another one if you guys

990
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,280
got a second

991
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,160
this is kind of fun ready for this one

992
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
vinegar is not inherently bad

993
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,359
oh it's not

994
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
okay

995
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,520
if a person has a problem with vinegar

996
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,200
they may have low hcl oxalate issues etc

997
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,440
really to who's science what science can

998
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,640
prove that or even say that

999
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,480
someone's just throwing theories

1000
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,920
that are in the alternative medicine

1001
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,200
world

1002
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
and they're just throwing it into the

1003
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,880
bag here so what does the medical medium

1004
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
get wrong apparently the medical medium

1005
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,560
has it wrong the

1006
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,240
vinegar is actually good for you

1007
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,280
so let's cut into the vinegar a little

1008
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,119
bit

1009
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,480

1010
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,000

1013
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,240
written it in my books that it's the

1014
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,680
best one there is but if you're

1015
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,280

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,720

have vinegar tara appleman hey tara

1041
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,119
i love when people use the phrase one

1042
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,599
size fits all to describe medical medium

1043
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,880
information mm info is the only thing i

1044
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,960
found that is not one size fits all

1045
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,400
tara

1046
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,880
it's true

1047
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
it's true

1048
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,119
so

1049
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,960
this person clearly who wrote this and

1050
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,040
posted about this hasn't watched

1051
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
instagram lives or facebook lives or

1052
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,520
rumble lives hasn't read the medical

1053
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,920
medium books but they did a hit job and

1054
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
they haven't listened to the podcasts so

1055
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,000
they did a hit job

1056
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,599
and since i bring in the soul into this

1057
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,320
stuff you know that just sits in your

1058
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,920
soul you do a hit job on purpose when

1059
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,200
you didn't do your homework or know

1060
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,280
about the other person so you

1061
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
intentionally did something evil and

1062
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,960
then you got your crowd of whatever

1063
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,560
followers behind it and they all think

1064
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,880
it's real

1065
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,440
that intention is dark

1066
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,880
what would actually possess

1067
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,440
a person a 20 year old or whoever that

1068
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,040
does this what would possess them to do

1069
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,440
dark malice intentions like that to

1070
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,119
derail people of healing when they don't

1071
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
even know the information or they ever

1072
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,960
even read the books

1073
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240
and that stays in the soul forever

1074
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
they may not think that because you

1075
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,960
think you're indestructible when you're

1076
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,079
20 years old and you think you got it

1077
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,520
all down because your functional

1078
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,440
medicine doctor taught you a few things

1079
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,440
about gut biome which is really theory

1080
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,040
gut microbiome and we can talk about

1081
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,599
that all day on how that works because

1082
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,359
if you're really ill those gut powders

1083
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,520
don't do anything you have to learn how

1084
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,119
to heal

1085
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,280
mollyanne marsh says i'm glad you are

1086
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,119
addressing this

1087
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,200
i have to dispel the misinformation to

1088
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,680
help people avoid the traps because

1089
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,119
these are trapped set by people

1090
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,640

people that were actually commenting in

1101
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,640
that crowd healed from using medical

1102
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,280
medium tools and they're sitting there

1103
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,040
on small levels

1119
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,800

too

1123
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,400
when you think about that

1124
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,400
or trying to destroy people's worlds

1125
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,880
post like this really does mess with my

1129
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,440
head

1130
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,200
like makes me think i will never heal

1131
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,079
and doing things wrong

1132
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,520
brian i'm so sorry i know

1133
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,079
and that's the post we're probably

1134
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,119
talking about for sure right now

1135
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,200
so let's go into a little bit more

1136
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,839
but before i go into these pieces i just

1137
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,400
want to say there's an evil machine

1138
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,960
trying to literally destroy

1139
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,040
humankind right now we know about that

1140
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,119
but this is on small levels that destroy

1141
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,040
lives too

1142
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,319
when you put stuff like this out there

1143
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,480
when you don't even know what's in the

1144
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,960
books or the podcasts or understand why

1145
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,119
someone's even sick and you put a tax

1146
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,280
like this out here and you alter

1147
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,280
people's perceptions and send them down

1148
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,960
a direction so they can't heal people

1149
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,119
are going to be poisoned when they see

1150
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,880
this they'll never think oh well maybe i

1151
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,160
should look at a medical mean book

1152
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,000
that's that's the number one new york

1153
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,359

around the world

1155
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,760
maybe i should never look at that guy

1156
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,599
maybe that guy is ugly maybe that guy

1157
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,760

bit plus you won't get good bike rides

1189
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,480
when you do that and you won't get good

1190
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,839
runs you won't be able to run the miles

1191
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,880
you want to run when you're too bulked

1192
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,400

1196
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,440
they can't run 10 miles real quick in

1197
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,800
the morning and then get back to work

1198
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
they can only run a half mile and then

1199
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,319

1200
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,640

1202
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,800

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,880
so oh

1217
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,560
um let me just listen to you then

1218
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,319
what am i doing wrong with my heavy

1219
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,400
metal detox smoothie that's been saving

1220
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,400
lives for decades

1221
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,480
uh okay let's talk about you want me to

1222
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,599
put binders in there

1223
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,720
okay what are binders charcoal

1224
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,760
clay

1225
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,599
chlorella fulvic acid

1226
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,680
you want me to put humic acid you want

1227
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,000
me to put these binders in

1228
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,000
um those are theories they don't grab

1229
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,920
toxic heavy metals

1230
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
there's not one study that shows

1231
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,599
charcoal grabbing or binding onto a

1232
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,520
toxic heavy metal

1233
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,839
there's not one study that shows that

1234
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,760
you need a binder

1235
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,440
there's not one study of any of that

1236
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,440
because first of all the heavy metal

1237
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,680
world of toxic heavy metals causing

1238
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,839
problems originates from 35 years of my

1239
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,920
work of teaching people

1240
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,800
and the heavy metal detox smoothie

1241
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,760
that's saving lives

1242
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,760
has

1243
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,079
spirulina in there

1244
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,720
barley grass juice powder in there

1245
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,040
cilantro in there while blueberries

1246
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,400
pecked in from wild blueberries

1247
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,599
pectin's a binder

1248
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,920
pectin's a binder it's got two cups of

1249
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,040
wild blueberries in the heavy metal

1250
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,040
detox smoothie

1251
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,960
the point is is someone sitting here who

1252
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,480
doesn't even know how metals work or

1253
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,240
anything and they're telling me i don't

1254
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,720
address binders

1255
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,240
april 10. i got put on binders by my

1256
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,760
health coach really didn't help me and

1257
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,119
can i tell you april

1258
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,640
binders

1259
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,480
i've seen it hospitalize people

1260
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,920
i've seen people use binders like

1261
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,000
charcoal and clay and end up in the

1262
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,440
hospital with crohn's and colitis serum

1263
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,040
severely suffering and they had

1264
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,560
literally lost two three months of their

1265
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,880
life they were in the hospital because

1266
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,640
the clay got into their intestinal tract

1267
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,319
and colon and stuck into the walls and

1268
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,839
they were in agony and needed to be put

1269
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,119
on morphine

1270
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,880
i don't use charcoal and clays for a

1271
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,359
reason it can destroy people's lives i

1272
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,520
don't like them i told people why many

1273
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,160
times corella is also highly toxic and

1274
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,640
carries bacteria 90 of the time and i've

1275
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,359
seen kids that were on chlorella from

1276
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,520
their practitioners literally in

1277
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,200
hospital beds because i'm morphine

1278
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,720
because the corella had bacteria and

1279
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,520
almost killed them

1280
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,280
it's in my books this stuff

1281
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,800
so i have a person here that's so

1282
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,920
experienced i'm not trying to be

1283
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,000
sarcastic but so experienced apparently

1284
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,760
it says he does not state that binders

1285
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,680
should be used when ingesting the heavy

1286
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,440
metal detox smoothie are on his detox

1287
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,680
lenses

1288
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,520
jamie says your heavy metal detox movie

1289
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,440
helped me get rid of my panic disorder

1290
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,040
yeah and if there were binders such as

1291
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,480
charcoal in there your panic disorder

1292
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,680
would have got worse because the

1293
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,599
charcoal is so agitating to the central

1294
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,359
nervous system into the vagus nerves but

1295
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
this person would never know this but

1296
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,960
this person's post garnered a lot of

1297
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,400
attention

1298
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,839
and there's so many people turned off

1299
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,800
the medical medium information that

1300
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,800
could save their lives

1301
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,319
and i'm not thinking about my livelihood

1302
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,319
because i tell everybody

1303
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,839
get it at the library for free i don't

1304
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,920
care if i can't turn the lights on

1305
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,800
anymore

1306
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,319
get it in the library for free

1307
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,000
but here's what's funny the person that

1308
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,920
put this post out and the first be other

1309
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,839
people too they start investing in other

1310
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,960
stuff you start becoming part of that

1311
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,160
whole mlm pyramid stuff and

1312
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,119
and

1313
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,599
you know

1314
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,280
whatever ambassador stuff and they got

1315
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,119
their own plans

1316
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,880
of why they're doing what they're doing

1317
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,440
evil intentions

1318
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,160
keeps a mark on your soul you do

1319
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,400
something terrible for a reason it stays

1320
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,240
in the soul whether you know it or not

1321
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,240
and it lives there

1322
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,240
and we have to contend with it someday

1323
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,520
let's go a little bit more oh here's a

1324
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,800
good one now let's go into this real

1325
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,720
quick

1326
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,599
all right

1327
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,920
right

1328
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,640
he states that blood draws

1329
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,040
are blood or bloodletting

1330
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,680
vampirism he states that blood draws are

1331
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,960
blood letting and vampirism this is

1332
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,680
dangerously false as blood work can give

1333
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,240
us

1334
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,240
essential information when did dr faun

1335
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,200
good good to see you dr fun did i ever

1336
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,280
said to people never to get blood work

1337
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,559
did i ever dr font

1338
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,319
md

1339
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,079
did i ever in

1340
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,440
all the decades of doing this and

1341
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,680
anywhere else in my book should i ever

1342
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,359
tell somebody never to get a blood test

1343
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,200
to ever say that it's not helpful in any

1344
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,119
way

1345
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,559
what i've said is the same thing i've

1346
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,640
always said

1347
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,800
you get too much blood drawn when you're

1348
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,319
pregnant you damage the baby when you

1349
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,559
get too much blood drawn when you have

1350
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,720
neurological lyme it can send you

1351
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,040
backwards for months you get too much

1352
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,720
blood drawn when you're chronically ill

1353
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,040
and you can remove a part of your immune

1354
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,040
system and not bounce back i said

1355
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,960
there's a way to do it you have to learn

1356
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,800
how to do it

1357
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,319
you can ask your doctor for blood work

1358
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,839
and learn how to protect yourself

1359
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,839
medical medium information

1360
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
is about protecting yourself

1361
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,079
you can listen to the podcast the blood

1362
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,599
draw podcast so you know how to protect

1363
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,800
yourself

1364
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,880
too much

1365
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,839
amigo 500 says too much damages the

1366
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,839
immune system

1367
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,119
tear appleman says no complete

1368
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,040
misunderstanding twisting your words

1369
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,680
exactly

1370
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
exactly

1371
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,839
so important to know dr fond he said to

1372
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,599
avoid taking too much

1373
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,359
but this person has scared a lot of

1374
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,200
people with this one because all of a

1375
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,559
sudden i look like a guy

1376
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,359
that never wants you to go to your

1377
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,359
doctor and get blood work that's insane

1378
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,440
definitely get your blood work

1379
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,640
but i always recommend doing what i

1380
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,400
recommend friends to do

1381
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,079
is you ask for half files or quarter

1382
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,520
miles

1383
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,800
and you'd be cautious to how much is

1384
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,960
being drawn when you're really

1385
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,359
chronically ill because i don't want you

1386
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,720
to have to go backwards and backwards

1387
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,520
and backwards and then you think your

1388
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,240
celery juice made you sick

1389
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,760
michelle l details matter

1390
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,319
so i'm gonna read a couple more if you

1391
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,200
guys don't mind right here's one right

1392
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,119
here

1393
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,520
this is a good one

1394
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,720
eggs are not the unhealthy

1395
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,680
everyone

1396
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,200
is bio-individual so eggs are not the

1397
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,440
unhealthy

1398
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,240
everyone is bio-individual

1399
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,400
creating food fear is dangerous

1400
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,800
okay

1401
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,760
you know why everybody

1402
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,359
who

1403
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,200
has been there and done that out there

1404
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,880
loves medical medium information because

1405
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,520
it allowed them to eat fruit for the

1406
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,920
first time in their

1407
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,920
sick chronically ill lives

1408
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,559
medical medium information opens the

1409
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,400
floodgate to all the herbs it opens the

1410
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,079
floodgate to all the leafy greens it

1411
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,720
opens the floodgate to every vegetable

1412
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,480
it opens the floodgate to all the fruit

1413
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,559
it opens the floodgate if you want to

1414
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,160
still eat animal protein okay it opens

1415
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,480
the floodgate if you want to do even

1416
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,240
some grains and oats medical medium

1417
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,359
information is not about

1418
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,960
food fear or fruit fear

1419
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,960
it's about making sure that if you're

1420
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,920
chronically ill that you stand a chance

1421
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,760
you can actually heal and recover

1422
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,520
and if you know what to avoid when

1423
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,000
you're really sick yeah i got friends

1424
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,280
that eat eggs

1425
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,880
i don't say anything because they're not

1426
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,400
sick

1427
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,319
you're sick

1428
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,440
you got a problem

1429
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,040
you're going to get in trouble so i want

1430
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,800
to talk about something you guys i want

1431
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,559
to actually drop something on you guys

1432
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
that's important right now a few of the

1433
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,680
haters that were in the medical medium

1434
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,119
community that got their lives back that

1435
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,559
posted about how they got their lives

1436
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,920
back for years

1437
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,680
healed used all the medical meat

1438
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,760
information drank their 32 ounces of

1439
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,720
celery juice did their heavy metal detox

1440
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,319
smoothies

1441
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,599
avoided eggs and everything they got

1442
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,000
their lives back and then they left the

1443
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,440
community and they got mad at me

1444
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,280
i don't know why

1445
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,200
but they got mad at me and left the

1446
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,359
community and then started up their

1447
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,119
alkaline ionizer water machines oh

1448
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,880
that's why i forget

1449
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,920
they started their other stuff they

1450
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,000
wanted to do and then as time went on

1451
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,720
they started doing things like eggs and

1452
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,400
things like that again and then they got

1453
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,440
sick again

1454
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,440
they got sick again

1455
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,880
because

1456
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,880
they healed because they avoided eggs

1457
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,400
because they had a pathogen

1458
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,880
and then they started tanking the eggs

1459
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,640
like eating a lot of eggs

1460
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,400
and then they started to digress in

1461
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,400
their healing because they were making

1462
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,119
themselves sick again and they started

1463
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,880
developing symptoms a lot of people go

1464
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,040
through that process but they never

1465
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,359
correct anything they never say okay i'm

1466
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,119

was right

1478
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,520
and and and here all i have to do is

1480
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,680

one fixes anything

1482
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,800
i don't know if it's pride or it's ego

1483
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,839
samantha says they will twist and mold

1484
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,839
all

1485
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,760
what you said to suit their own agenda

1486
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,920
absolutely

1487
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,480
so here's another one right here

1488
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,599
there is no scientific evidence for

1489
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,520
cluster salts in celery juice however

1490
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:23,520
ever celery juice can help some people

1491
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:26,079
science hasn't studied celery juice yet

1492
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,720
this person doesn't know this yet but

1493
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,880
science has not studied celery juice yet

1494
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,640
i have been waiting forever and when

1495
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,000
they do study it they will find the

1496
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,640
things in there and then they'll talk

1497
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,160
about it just like harvard and other

1498
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,760
places studied epstein-barr recently and

1499
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,119
found out that medical media was right

1500
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,040
that epstein-barr is the cause of

1501
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,400
multiple sclerosis and now seven years

1502
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,400
later

1503
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,839
after i published it

1504
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,319
they're doing

1505
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,240
papers on there now right well the same

1506
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,240
thing's gonna happen with celery juice

1507
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,319
give it time and when you're 20 years

1508
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,160
old or 22 years old or whatever you are

1509
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,599
yeah seven years from now and 10 years

1510
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,040
from now you'll see that celery juice

1511
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,280
has special things in it and guess what

1512
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,160
you'll never fix this you'll never say

1513
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,280
you guys i did a post seven years ago on

1514
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,119
my ig and i did that post and i i ripped

1515
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,880
this guy apart and i made people not

1516
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,040
drink celery juice anymore i made them

1517
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,960
doubt celery juice but i'm not gonna fix

1518
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,720
it you guys i'm not gonna go back and

1519
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,559
fix it and tell everybody i was wrong

1520
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,800
medical medium was right

1521
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,599
and that this whole time science finally

1522
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,280
did discover it because i had people say

1523
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,800
bad things about medical media when i

1524
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,440
said multiple cirrhosis multiple

1525
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,280
sclerosis was caused by epstein barr and

1526
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,559
people ripped me apart you guys

1527
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,559
including people in the science

1528
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,280
community they ripped medical medium

1529
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,000
apart years ago because i stood up and

1530
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,839
said epstein-barr causes ms but guess

1531
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,839
what now that they discovered it is true

1532
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,520
no one's coming back and correcting it

1533
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,400
no one's putting articles out and saying

1534
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,200
oh my god

1535
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,960
we ripped apart aw seven years ago and

1536
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,240
and we wrote these bad articles about

1537
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,640
him and we said all these terrible

1538
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,880
things but look he was right he he

1539
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,359
actually does hear he is a prophet he

1540
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,359
does hear from from spirit of compassion

1541
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,200
and we're not gonna correct it we're not

1542
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,680
gonna say he was right

1543
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,400
that's how evil works

1544
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,079
it's part of how evil works and

1545
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,760
it's in your soul

1546
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,160
the people who do this

1547
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,160
they keep that in their soul that they

1548
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,240
had intentions that are that dark what

1549
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,920
does that say that says when you leave

1550
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,319
this place no matter what happens you

1551
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,440
take that with you and your soul just

1552
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,760
floats around out of here as you leave

1553
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,040
and it harbors all that ill intent and

1554
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,760
all that corrosive attempt intent and

1555
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,559
and

1556
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,720
and all of it and malice and just

1557
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,880
everything and it holds on to it and

1558
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,880
that's what you have to have in the end

1559
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,839
this for being like that's what these

1560
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,839
people have

1561
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,760
here's one right here

1562
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,000
gut infections and pathogens can still

1563
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,599
feed on fruits veggies starches etc

1564
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,799
despite what he claims

1565
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,119
no one knew a pathogen fed it's medical

1566
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:07,119
medium information

1567
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,400
she's actually taking medical medium

1568
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,160
information

1569
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,160
and throwing it back at me

1570
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,079
i'm confused wait a minute

1571
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,119
science of research didn't know that

1572
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,319
pathogens ate anything

1573
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,160
this is it doesn't exist

1574
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,319
i've been talking about it for 35 years

1575
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,319
the pathogens eat food but everybody

1576
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,720
laughed at it

1577
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,920
science doesn't believe that a virus

1578
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,559
eats

1579
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,640
but here this person throws medical

1580
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,319
medium information published in medical

1581
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,319
media books and and talked about in

1582
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,319
lectures for years throws it back at me

1583
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,000
and says gut infections and pathogens

1584
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,720
can still feed on fruits veggies and

1585
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,559
starches that's funny because pathogens

1586
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,839
don't feed on anything says all the

1587
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,599
science in the world including

1588
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,960
alternative science

1589
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,760
this person took

1590
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,680
mm info that's unique and put it in here

1591
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,160
as if it was known and threw it back at

1592
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,480
me as if i don't do it

1593
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,440
this can act this is actually like

1594
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,440
twilight zone

1595
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,599
let's take a look at another one a

1596
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,920
strict vegan diet can cause blood sugar

1597
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,880
imbalances and gut dysbiosis for certain

1598
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,160
people

1599
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,079
who said

1600
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,839
and by the way it's damaging false

1601
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,880
information this person's putting out

1602
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,799
there

1603
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,920
defamation

1604
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:25,040
and damaging false in information by the

1605
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,040
way

1606
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,720
thank god

1607
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,960
i'm not like somebody else some of these

1608
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,240
other people did you know if you say one

1609
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,480
little

1610
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,359
bad word did you guys know this you say

1611
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,040
one little bad word about doctor

1612
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,920
and doctor

1613
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,520
and doctor in a podcast and doctor

1614
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,559
you guys know the doctors i don't have

1615
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,480
to say their name you say one bad word

1616
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,720
you're just somebody on a post that you

1617
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,359
just don't all of a sudden like dr john

1618
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,880
and you'd often don't like dr gunner

1619
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,000
and you say one little thing in your

1620
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,200
post

1621
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,480
do you know how fried you would be

1622
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,839
your whole account would probably come

1623
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,760
down

1624
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:08,160
but did you know that i i don't do that

1625
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,000
i let people speak their stuff and say

1626
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,319
their stuff and put it out there and

1627
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,480
defame me and put all this

1628
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:16,480
this wrong information

1629
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,799
and i let them do that

1630
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,720
because i believe in like freedom

1631
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,559
i let them do that

1632
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,599
but all the podcast doctors would come

1633
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,280
down on this person tomorrow

1634
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,760
and they'd be in some serious trouble

1635
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,680
you'd see some pr marketing people you'd

1636
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,200
see some publicist you see some people

1637
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,359
coming down on these people and oh my

1638
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,839
god would they get served a whole bunch

1639
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,520
of stuff

1640
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,119
so this person's take advantage of

1641
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,680
taking advantage of medical medium

1642
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,680
kindness

1643
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,200
sick

1644
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,880
here's something a strict vegan diet can

1645
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,640
cause blood sugar imbalances and gut

1646
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,319
dysbiosis for certain people strict

1647
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,000
vegan diet

1648
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,440
i sit here until i'm blue on the face

1649
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,480
and tell people you can heal if you're

1650
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,480
eating animal protein

1651
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,400
you can heal when you're plant-based you

1652
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,400
can heal if you're vegan

1653
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,720
but you gotta look you gotta look out

1654
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,160
for that nutritional yeast whatever you

1655
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,920
are you gotta look out for that vinegar

1656
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,359
and you gotta look out for that caffeine

1657
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,880
because that could be the bridge that

1658
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,079
stops you from healing the bridge that

1659
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,839
breaks and stops you from healing

1660
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,440
i told you the vegan people have hated

1661
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,559
me for years yes there's vegans in the

1662
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,839
medical meeting community just like

1663
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,280
there's animal protein people in the

1664
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,520
medical media community the vegan people

1665
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,680
have hated me for years the vegan people

1666
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,240
because they don't think i support

1667
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,599
veganism and they hate me for it this

1668
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,119
person's acting like i'm one of the

1669
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,160
vegan like

1670
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,160
parades out there

1671
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,359
dysbiosis no one knows what's supposed

1672
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,799
to be in the gut by the way

1673
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:49,839
who who like no one has an exact um

1674
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:51,599
there's no exact science to dysbiosis

1675
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,359
so here's somebody that's just

1676
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,359
throwing out whatever okay

1677
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,319
here's one right here he states that

1678
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,559
there should not be fruit fear yet

1679
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:06,200
creates fear around

1680
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,200
other food groups

1681
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:28,880
where's my coffee

1682
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,200
where's my espresso

1683
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,799
where's my bars of chocolate

1684
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,280
because i want to caffeine my baby

1685
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,640
so my my baby has an addiction now to

1686
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,240
caffeine it goes through shakes and

1687
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,960
withdrawal inside my woman i don't even

1688
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,119
know it i educate people

1689
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,040
on how to protect so you can protect

1690
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,799
your second baby and your third baby and

1691
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,720
your fourth baby

1692
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:54,079
so they don't become heroin addicts when

1693
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,440
they're 15 years old and 18 years old

1694
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,960
and they don't become junkies when

1695
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:02,079
they're 21 years old and ruin your life

1696
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,799
i educate people so i can protect moms

1697
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,680
and babies and children i educate people

1698
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:11,480
about food groups like caffeine

1699
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,480
and other food groups

1700
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,400
and so

1701
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,520
anyway it goes on and on and on

1702
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,040
and there's plenty to be had too

1703
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,640
so

1704
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,599
but i'm going to talk about this again i

1705
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,359
think i'm going to go to ig

1706
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,000
i'll go to ig i'm going to put tick-tock

1707
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,839
back on too right

1708
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,960
ignoring them is best

1709
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:43,839
their time and andy says i i understand

1710
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,960
that like honestly ignoring them is best

1711
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,920
right

1712
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,760
true

1713
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,440
but when you watch a lot of people that

1714
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,400
get hurt

1715
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,040
and they

1716
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,480
they'll never actually find their way

1717
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,000
when they get really sick like

1718
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,760
chronically ill because they'll always

1719
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,680
be poisoned there'll be something inside

1720
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,039
of them that says no i don't know where

1721
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,960
i heard it

1722
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,960
but i heard he just he's bad

1723
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,200
and it's sad

1724
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,960
i'm a fighter i'm a fighter for the

1725
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,440
chronicle

1726
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,680
not a fighter for myself

1727
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,520
if i was a fighter for myself i would do

1728
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,680
other things i guess

1729
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,119
i'm a fighter for the chronicle

1730
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,440
and that's what i do

1731
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,520
and that's what gets me

1732
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,920
helene says you don't create fear that's

1733
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,839
nonsense you educate with the truth on

1734
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,520

1735
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,039
