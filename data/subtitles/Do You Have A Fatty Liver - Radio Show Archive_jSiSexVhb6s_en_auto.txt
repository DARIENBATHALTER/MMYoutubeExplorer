[21.80 - 27.20] week we talk about the most advanced
[24.56 - 28.44] health information out there it's
[27.20 - 29.80] important to know that because it's

[40.12 - 43.88] years for answers we're talking about
[42.08 - 45.40] Liver Rescue but we're talking about
[43.88 - 46.88] fatty liver which is actually in the
[45.40 - 49.24] liver rescue book this is really
[46.88 - 50.80] important fatty liver is a big deal and
[49.24 - 53.72] I want to cover it cover it as if you
[50.80 - 56.48] don't think you have fatty liver think
[53.72 - 58.84] again because there's pre pre pre fatty
[56.48 - 61.20] liver basically fat buildup in the liver
[58.84 - 63.12] over time before could even be diagnosed
[61.20 - 64.40] so it's really important to know how it
[63.12 - 66.52] works with fatty liver so that's where
[64.40 - 69.88] we're really going going into it I mean
[66.52 - 72.16] who has 5 10 years for answers 15 years
[69.88 - 74.36] for answers to wait I mean to wait and
[72.16 - 76.00] wait and wait because you you know you
[74.36 - 77.72] lose time and that's the whole thing
[76.00 - 80.36] with chronic illness people lose time I
[77.72 - 82.48] mean there's so many people that were I
[80.36 - 83.68] mean diagnosed or not diagnosed with so
[82.48 - 85.76] many different conditions with
[83.68 - 88.68] neurological problems symptoms all kinds
[85.76 - 90.68] of different symptoms Galore everything
[88.68 - 92.48] different diagnoses and they you know
[90.68 - 94.12] they had to go from Doctor to doctor to
[92.48 - 95.68] doctor including with lime and multiple
[94.12 - 97.16] sclerosis and getting diagnosed with
[95.68 - 99.64] this and that and Hashimoto and
[97.16 - 101.88] everything and all they needed was
[99.64 - 104.24] answers and and I've given answers to
[101.88 - 106.72] people to get them free to escape that
[104.24 - 108.40] whole trap and that marry go round of of
[106.72 - 109.72] having to go to everywhere doctor to
[108.40 - 111.08] doctor and going through all these
[109.72 - 113.60] different treatments and everything else
[111.08 - 117.08] there are ways of actually healing there
[113.60 - 119.04] are ways of getting out of that trap and
[117.08 - 122.96] there are ways of getting out of mystery
[119.04 - 125.00] illness there really really is tens of
[122.96 - 127.40] thousands and now hundreds of thousands
[125.00 - 129.28] and even close to Millions now at this
[127.40 - 131.44] point are getting answers like with the
[129.28 - 133.04] celery juice turning their lives around
[131.44 - 135.92] and with other things that we brought
[133.04 - 138.32] here so the whole point is look there's
[135.92 - 140.28] so much to learn and with fatty liver we
[138.32 - 142.32] got a lot to learn and it's all about
[140.28 - 144.84] Liver Rescue it's in Liver Rescue so if
[142.32 - 146.28] you don't have the Liver Rescue book um
[144.84 - 148.08] you know one thing just you know
[146.28 - 150.20] whatever you do the book is so big and
[148.08 - 152.08] there's so much information in it that
[150.20 - 153.64] you just you can't get it from the radio
[152.08 - 155.52] show it's just not going to happen I
[153.64 - 157.48] could do a string of radio shows and
[155.52 - 159.52] it's not going to happen so if you can't
[157.48 - 161.76] afford a book for whatever it is $15 $20
[159.52 - 163.24] or whatever it is go go to the library
[161.76 - 164.72] and uh take out the book there or
[163.24 - 166.88] whatever you need to do to get one get
[164.72 - 168.76] one in your hands so you can work on
[166.88 - 171.00] healing it's so important so fatty liver
[168.76 - 172.40] is where we are that's where we're going
[171.00 - 174.88] so let's start let's figure it out so
[172.40 - 177.40] you know as we go through life as we go
[174.88 - 178.92] through life we eat to survive and we
[177.40 - 180.48] have we run into like challenging
[178.92 - 182.40] circumstances
[180.48 - 184.40] any this happens in life you know it's
[182.40 - 186.96] it's how it works and we're under stress
[184.40 - 189.00] we're under pressure and it can hold us
[186.96 - 191.92] back from eating healthier foods I mean
[189.00 - 193.68] come on right you know that you know
[191.92 - 195.80] that it can hold us back I mean from
[193.68 - 198.08] eating healthier foods absolutely we're
[195.80 - 200.72] trying to live we're living to survive
[198.08 - 202.96] we end up eating to survive it's not
[200.72 - 205.48] quite not everybody has the resources
[202.96 - 206.72] not everybody can sit on a boat all
[205.48 - 210.16] summer
[206.72 - 212.92] long you know what I mean can sit on a a
[210.16 - 216.16] yacht all summer long and get meals made
[212.92 - 218.24] for them it's not everybody can do that
[216.16 - 221.08] you know you know these cute little
[218.24 - 223.80] meals made for them and the perfect lean
[221.08 - 226.52] fish and protein and little salads and
[223.80 - 228.96] fruit salads and and all these other
[226.52 - 230.80] things and you know and you're just like
[228.96 - 232.32] you not everybody can live like that
[230.80 - 234.16] where they're eating healthier choices
[232.32 - 236.32] where they're they're able to say oh no
[234.16 - 238.16] hold off the gluten give me a real tasty
[236.32 - 239.68] dish with no gluten and no whatever in
[238.16 - 242.00] it and then there's some Chef kill
[239.68 - 243.28] killing themselves literally killing
[242.00 - 245.68] themselves trying to make all this
[243.28 - 247.08] flavor happen and put all this this you
[245.68 - 248.44] know healthier food together and
[247.08 - 250.40] everything here's a little here's a
[248.44 - 252.60] little quinoa couscous and a little this
[250.40 - 256.32] and put a little this on who has that I
[252.60 - 258.44] mean I mean usually we you know yeah how
[256.32 - 260.84] do you live like that it's not easy it's
[258.44 - 262.64] not easy not everybody has that those
[260.84 - 264.32] resources to go into the health food
[262.64 - 266.72] stores either I noticed that and
[264.32 - 268.36] actually just buy all the fresh produce
[266.72 - 269.84] they can possibly buy and all the
[268.36 - 271.96] whatever the leanest cuts of meat if you
[269.84 - 273.52] like animal protein and if you're in and
[271.96 - 275.88] if you're and if you're vegan or plant-
[273.52 - 277.60] paste all the whatever it is that you
[275.88 - 278.80] want and get avocados and all the other
[277.60 - 281.52] things and all the different fruits and
[278.80 - 284.24] vegetables and it's it's amazing how
[281.52 - 286.00] it's not so easy and if we're treading
[284.24 - 288.60] or back treading or whatever is
[286.00 - 290.44] backpedaling through life and we got all
[288.60 - 292.20] these jobs and responsibilities and got
[290.44 - 294.32] bills and got this and that and not much
[292.20 - 295.96] money or whatever it is that's going on
[294.32 - 297.32] and then chronic illness hits and
[295.96 - 300.16] chronic illness it's sick you're just
[297.32 - 302.52] trying to push through the day and
[300.16 - 305.32] there's nothing really easy about it and
[302.52 - 308.12] so what can happen is you end up eating
[305.32 - 310.88] a donut you end up eating a donut and
[308.12 - 312.68] maybe when life was good for some I've
[310.88 - 314.40] had people tell me hey life was the best
[312.68 - 316.36] ever when I was able to eat donuts and I
[314.40 - 318.04] was doing good and I was working a
[316.36 - 320.88] zillion hours and I could just scoff
[318.04 - 322.56] down a whole crab load of donuts and be
[320.88 - 324.36] back off to work it was no big deal
[322.56 - 326.16] that's the good old days you know what I
[324.36 - 328.48] mean so maybe it's that maybe it's the
[326.16 - 330.16] opposite for somebody but you end up you
[328.48 - 332.56] know like when life's ult and everything
[330.16 - 334.56] you can end up eating a donut because
[332.56 - 335.80] you may be on the Run trying to keep up
[334.56 - 337.84] the demanding
[335.80 - 340.36] schedule and and all of that and you
[337.84 - 342.64] might look you might be out of time and
[340.36 - 345.04] can't find another option in the moment
[342.64 - 347.60] or hey I'll have that slice of pizza
[345.04 - 349.56] someone may decide easily because it's
[347.60 - 351.20] easy get a slice of pizza and they're
[349.56 - 354.28] there in the moment hey a bagel with
[351.20 - 356.28] cream cheese a buttered croissant ice
[354.28 - 358.48] cream you know maybe as an after dinner
[356.28 - 361.00] treat chicken parmesan right chicken
[358.48 - 362.92] parmesan at some kind of restaurant I
[361.00 - 365.28] don't know a hot dog at a stand on a
[362.92 - 366.88] street or you know not even a stand I
[365.28 - 368.84] mean what about a food truck the food
[366.88 - 371.08] trucks that are like making all these
[368.84 - 373.68] kind of Abominations gastric
[371.08 - 376.44] Abominations that probably taste amazing
[373.68 - 378.72] for me right you got the food trucks
[376.44 - 380.80] it's unbelievable and so you know what
[378.72 - 382.40] about some barbecued ribs cuz you're you
[380.80 - 384.80] know your friend is paying for it so you
[382.40 - 387.12] end up getting some barbecued ribs and
[384.80 - 389.92] uh buffalo chicken wings how about that
[387.12 - 391.52] maybe some shrimp fried rice this is
[389.92 - 394.24] making me laugh by the way a piece of
[391.52 - 396.36] chocolate cake or maybe a fried egg or
[394.24 - 398.32] two or a slice of bacon a little here
[396.36 - 402.36] and a little there these are foods that
[398.32 - 404.96] get us by when life is harder and goes
[402.36 - 407.72] faster than we can keep up with I mean
[404.96 - 411.44] am I right or am I wrong I don't know
[407.72 - 416.00] maybe I'm wrong maybe I got it all
[411.44 - 418.68] wrong so whether we know it or not we
[416.00 - 420.12] eat like this to get by we eat like this
[418.68 - 421.72] to survive
[420.12 - 423.68] sometimes we eat like this for happiness
[421.72 - 425.48] of course too we're up against all the
[423.68 - 427.80] world it's impossible we get all wound
[425.48 - 429.96] up we get emotional it's completely
[427.80 - 434.80] understandable I mean if we eat foods to
[429.96 - 436.64] comfort ourselves I mean yeah like we do
[434.80 - 439.56] and you know we we want flavors to
[436.64 - 443.16] satisfi our satisfy our cravings and
[439.56 - 446.16] even get a sense of companionship
[443.16 - 448.72] absolutely absolutely but if we were
[446.16 - 450.68] more conscious about food you know we
[448.72 - 453.48] had a little less going on maybe we
[450.68 - 455.96] would take care of ourselves I
[453.48 - 457.64] understand I do and and what if we're
[455.96 - 459.64] fortunate what if somebody's fortunate
[457.64 - 463.16] and they have they have the resources to
[459.64 - 464.64] pursue all kinds of other ways of eating
[463.16 - 466.80] and you know they can look at a trendy
[464.64 - 469.12] diet right they can get into a trendy
[466.80 - 471.84] diet that seems incredibly healthy
[469.12 - 474.68] they'll go less often on a croissant or
[471.84 - 477.04] pizza they'll go less less often on
[474.68 - 479.48] pizza and they'll look for leaner cuts
[477.04 - 480.84] of meat and and cut out all grains and
[479.48 - 482.48] processed foods like all the trendy
[480.84 - 484.48] diets want you to do right they all want
[482.48 - 486.84] you to do that go with leaner cuts of
[484.48 - 488.72] meat bring in lots of vegetables and
[486.84 - 491.60] make sure and don't eat any fruit don't
[488.72 - 493.76] eat any fruit and and you know avoid all
[491.60 - 496.08] fruit whatever you do that's what they
[493.76 - 498.00] do right and it's like cut out all
[496.08 - 500.76] carbohydrates maybe we can do that one
[498.00 - 502.80] of those trendy diets and isn't that the
[500.76 - 505.36] answer isn't that the answer to do one
[502.80 - 507.64] of those trendy diets you guys me leaner
[505.36 - 510.24] cuts and meat cut out all the pro
[507.64 - 512.80] processed foods right
[510.24 - 514.68] you know clean things up stay away from
[512.80 - 517.32] the grains the whole bit bring in some
[514.68 - 519.00] bone broth right well that's cool could
[517.32 - 521.68] go to yoga afterwards after you know
[519.00 - 523.20] what I mean get some bone broth in you
[521.68 - 525.16] you know the whole bit and make sure
[523.20 - 526.64] we're doing some chicken chicken on a
[525.16 - 528.20] salad or something like that we're
[526.64 - 529.84] trying to follow these cool trendy diets
[528.20 - 531.88] we'll do an egg a hard-boiled egg in our
[529.84 - 533.72] salad and maybe that's better than all
[531.88 - 535.80] the processed foods and having a slice
[533.72 - 537.48] of pizza and doing this and that and
[535.80 - 540.40] maybe it is kind of better but it is is
[537.48 - 543.28] it the answer not as much as you would
[540.40 - 544.96] think trust me on that not as much as
[543.28 - 546.76] you would think it's the answer when it
[544.96 - 548.36] comes to avoiding one thing and I'm
[546.76 - 550.60] telling you right now when it comes to
[548.36 - 553.08] avoiding one thing and it's called fatty
[550.60 - 554.80] liver and if you don't believe me you'll
[553.08 - 556.04] get one later on if you don't think
[554.80 - 557.16] you're going to get one now you know the
[556.04 - 558.48] funny thing is when you're young you're
[557.16 - 560.32] just indestructible it's just like
[558.48 - 562.16] you're indestructible you know when
[560.32 - 564.40] you're young it's like basically when
[562.16 - 565.96] you're young it's just like hey follow a
[564.40 - 566.92] trendy diet if you got a stuff you nose
[565.96 - 568.92] and you're starting to get a little bit
[566.92 - 571.48] of bloat maybe your digestion is nothing

[587.64 - 590.08] whatever it is when you're young it's
[588.76 - 592.16] indestructible when I'm tell you when
[590.08 - 593.56] you feel indestructible but when you get
[592.16 - 594.80] older and I'm not talking about people
[593.56 - 595.96] who are young with chronic illness
[594.80 - 597.20] that's a different story talking about
[595.96 - 599.64] people that're really not dealing with
[597.20 - 601.48] too much when you get older
[599.64 - 603.12] and you get into your late 30s and that
[601.48 - 605.24] liver is picking up and that liver is
[603.12 - 606.80] getting fat in there and nobody knows
[605.24 - 609.44] about it and it could be all the trendy
[606.80 - 611.44] diets you want or ever thought were fine
[609.44 - 612.56] and good and you start getting older and
[611.44 - 614.28] all of a sudden that liver starts
[612.56 - 615.68] backing up and it starts throwing
[614.28 - 617.20] symptoms and then you're doing you're at
[615.68 - 618.44] the hormone doctor and nobody knows
[617.20 - 619.68] what's wrong and then viruses are
[618.44 - 621.24] starting to pick up and your thyroid
[619.68 - 623.32] starts to go boink because of Epstein
[621.24 - 624.84] bar and you're just like and you're 42
[623.32 - 626.80] years old and you start breaking out
[624.84 - 628.08] some kind of weird funky rash and all of
[626.80 - 629.52] a sudden something else is happened and
[628.08 - 631.12] the liver is getting fatty and nobody
[629.52 - 632.76] knows about it and then it's begin it's
[631.12 - 634.28] getting fattier and fattier with no
[632.76 - 635.48] diagnosis and just going through life
[634.28 - 636.52] then you're getting hot flashes then
[635.48 - 638.96] you're getting this then you're getting
[636.52 - 641.52] that you hear what I'm talking about no
[638.96 - 644.56] no one talks about that no one talks
[641.52 - 646.88] about that or anything like that it's
[644.56 - 648.68] amazing the the information is so
[646.88 - 650.04] Advanced what happens in like with Liver
[648.68 - 651.76] Rescue and all the rest of the medical
[650.04 - 653.72] medium series that I can't even talk to
[651.76 - 655.48] doctors too often because it's almost
[653.72 - 657.52] like I have to say okay just give me a
[655.48 - 658.80] stupid shot real quick give me a stupid

[730.96 - 734.36] you cleaning up your diet and everything

[734.36 - 737.80] oh my God they don't know anything about
[736.12 - 739.20] the liver know nothing about how the
[737.80 - 740.40] Body Works they don't even know
[739.20 - 741.92] understand Epstein bar until the
[740.40 - 743.32] information we put out there really they
[741.92 - 745.64] knew about Epstein bar but they didn't
[743.32 - 747.64] know what it did nobody knew nothing and
[745.64 - 749.24] the information is saving people's lives
[747.64 - 752.24] right now from the medical medium is
[749.24 - 753.72] saving people's lives across the board
[752.24 - 756.24] millions of people actually on the
[753.72 - 759.36] planet right now are getting help from
[756.24 - 761.20] that so but when it comes down to like
[759.36 - 763.56] understanding just the basics of how the
[761.20 - 766.44] blood works and how if you fill it with
[763.56 - 769.32] fat how bad it can really be and how you
[766.44 - 772.00] get that pre fatty liver over time and
[769.32 - 774.32] then you age quicker it's all cute all

[797.88 - 801.56] is but I'm telling you right now the
[799.88 - 802.96] liver doesn't like it unless you take
[801.56 - 804.32] care of yourself and learn how to take
[802.96 - 806.04] care of yourself so you don't end up
[804.32 - 807.56] getting a chronic illness so you can
[806.04 - 809.08] actually help yourself and anybody who
[807.56 - 811.00] has a chronic illness you can help your
[809.08 - 813.68] liver now and really do something about
[811.00 - 816.48] it and really turn it around it's
[813.68 - 818.56] amazing how it works it's
[816.48 - 820.00] amazing they don't know in the medical
[818.56 - 821.56] field they don't know in alternative
[820.00 - 823.24] medicine yet they don't know in
[821.56 - 825.52] conventional medicine yet how to
[823.24 - 827.68] forewarn somebody to really help take
[825.52 - 829.96] care of themselves how to help somebody
[827.68 - 833.60] so they don't get themselves in trouble
[829.96 - 835.76] so they could really heal or actually
[833.60 - 837.44] not get sick when they're chronically
[835.76 - 840.36] ill to heal and when they're not
[837.44 - 843.20] chronically ill yet chronically ill yet
[840.36 - 846.48] how to heal it's amazing how the
[843.20 - 848.28] industry works it's incredible and
[846.48 - 850.32] you'll find those Trend Setters all

[852.44 - 857.04] and gobbles of supplements they send
[855.04 - 859.08] this trend setters gobbles us up build
[857.04 - 861.96] your platform hang your head on a stupid
[859.08 - 864.44] idea and sell millions of dollars in
[861.96 - 866.96] supplements and you know what maybe
[864.44 - 869.40] that's fine then maybe that's fine maybe
[866.96 - 870.72] that's fine you know what I mean maybe
[869.40 - 873.20] it's fine maybe it's fine they're making
[870.72 - 875.48] $4 million a month and they're just
[873.20 - 877.20] selling you crap supplements maybe
[875.48 - 879.76] that's fine and there's you know selling
[877.20 - 880.88] you on some some camany idea and
[879.76 - 882.48] everything and they're just all about
[880.88 - 883.64] high fat diets and all about no carbs
[882.48 - 884.80] and stay away from fruit and they're
[883.64 - 885.92] selling you supplements and everything
[884.80 - 887.20] else maybe that's fine they're selling
[885.92 - 888.52] you collagen they're selling it this
[887.20 - 889.56] they're selling you anti-lectin stuff
[888.52 - 891.92] they're selling you whatever it is they
[889.56 - 893.92] selling whatever it is they're selling
[891.92 - 895.96] maybe that's just fine and
[893.92 - 898.24] dandy maybe it
[895.96 - 900.08] is but I'll tell you right now I mean I
[898.24 - 902.52] don't think it's that fine I'll tell you
[900.08 - 905.32] right now because isn't it about getting
[902.52 - 906.48] someone better learning the truth
[905.32 - 908.92] understanding the truth and getting them
[906.48 - 910.80] better isn't it about really proactively
[908.92 - 912.68] making sure someone doesn't get sick
[910.80 - 914.16] because it's so awful when someone gets
[912.68 - 916.20] sick and they stay sick and their life
[914.16 - 918.28] goes they're I mean I've seen people
[916.20 - 920.08] lose things I've seen people lose
[918.28 - 922.00] everything from being
[920.08 - 924.36] sick
[922.00 - 926.48] everything you there's a lot of homeless
[924.36 - 929.52] people out there you don't think a whole
[926.48 - 933.44] bunch of them weren't sick it's
[929.52 - 935.80] unbelievable of how it works and so the
[933.44 - 937.96] compassion has to be there and it has to
[935.80 - 939.64] be there and it has to stop any chronic
[937.96 - 941.00] illness and it has the information has
[939.64 - 942.84] to be there someone said what's the
[941.00 - 944.32] point of your books I said what do you
[942.84 - 947.64] mean what's the point of the
[944.32 - 949.52] books what do you mean the point is to
[947.64 - 951.44] make sure that you can protect your
[949.52 - 953.00] family protect your children make sure
[951.44 - 955.04] you have the answer so when you do get
[953.00 - 957.04] sick neurologically or anything I don't
[955.04 - 959.08] care what it is you can actually do
[957.04 - 961.44] something about it just like the celery
[959.08 - 963.64] juice that nobody knew about no one knew
[961.44 - 965.60] about until we brought it to town and
[963.64 - 968.16] then it gets it gets it gets destroyed
[965.60 - 969.72] out there it gets destroyed out there
[968.16 - 971.60] cuz people are just they all of a sudden
[969.72 - 972.80] you know like don't do this do this do
[971.60 - 975.12] this whatever all these people like
[972.80 - 976.72] these just making up stuff meanwhile
[975.12 - 979.08] here's where it comes from here's what
[976.72 - 981.00] you do with the celery juice and it gets
[979.08 - 983.08] rid of fatty liver cuz what happens is
[981.00 - 985.40] once your liver starts getting
[983.08 - 988.60] fatty everything else starts going down
[985.40 - 992.60] the drain slowly you age your skin a
[988.60 - 994.24] ages everything ages along the way and
[992.60 - 998.36] you just you all of a sudden your liver
[994.24 - 1000.44] just says hey hey ho we're done we're
[998.36 - 1001.96] done I can't really protect you so much
[1000.44 - 1003.44] anymore so all those toxins are going to
[1001.96 - 1005.12] just age your skin really quick you're
[1003.44 - 1007.04] going to stretch it out it's not going
[1005.12 - 1008.80] to bounce back you're going to have all
[1007.04 - 1009.92] this acne keep on coming and going
[1008.80 - 1011.44] you're going to have all this other
[1009.92 - 1013.80] stuff keep on going these skin problems
[1011.44 - 1015.80] it's not even just that you're going to
[1013.80 - 1018.48] have all these heart stuff later on down
[1015.80 - 1019.60] the road you know the thing is with the
[1018.48 - 1022.48] younger crowd they don't think they're
[1019.60 - 1024.84] ever going to be 60 years old they don't
[1022.48 - 1026.60] think they're going to be 60 years old
[1024.84 - 1028.72] they don't I've talked to people they
[1026.60 - 1030.40] don't they don't believe it they don't
[1028.72 - 1031.92] believe it they don't believe they're
[1030.40 - 1035.76] ever going to be
[1031.92 - 1038.24] 60 is the craziest thing they don't
[1035.76 - 1040.32] believe they're going to be 40 you know
[1038.24 - 1041.64] back many many years ago a few decades
[1040.32 - 1043.16] ago when I was doing this cuz I was
[1041.64 - 1044.68] doing it and the information was just as
[1043.16 - 1046.28] advanced as it is now in fact it's the
[1044.68 - 1048.56] same information how do you like them
[1046.28 - 1050.44] apples and all the books the medic
[1048.56 - 1053.00] medium series information I was giving
[1050.44 - 1054.68] 30 years ago that people say is Advanced
[1053.00 - 1056.16] even people say the doctors say And
[1054.68 - 1057.72] scientists even say that this is where
[1056.16 - 1059.20] where it's going in medicine as far as
[1057.72 - 1062.20] this is the most advanced information
[1059.20 - 1064.08] out there in chronic health I knew that
[1062.20 - 1066.48] information 30 years ago cuz it all came
[1064.08 - 1068.60] from the same Source but I remember
[1066.48 - 1070.04] talking to younger people back 30 years
[1068.60 - 1072.88] ago people did think they were going to
[1070.04 - 1073.96] be 60 years old someday they did think
[1072.88 - 1076.68] they were going to be
[1073.96 - 1080.20] 55 they did think they were going to be
[1076.68 - 1083.16] 64 now the the younger crowd they don't
[1080.20 - 1085.36] think they're going to be 60 it's
[1083.16 - 1086.68] unbelievable and and that's not good
[1085.36 - 1088.12] because it makes you not want to really
[1086.68 - 1090.92] take care of yourself to actually look
[1088.12 - 1093.24] out so that's just one aspect of it but
[1090.92 - 1095.60] here's how the liver Works let's go into
[1093.24 - 1098.36] this and let's start let's start like
[1095.60 - 1100.32] chopping into this a little bit I hope
[1098.36 - 1103.48] everybody's having a good a good time
[1100.32 - 1105.56] anyway so far okay so bear with me bear
[1103.48 - 1107.08] with me the one thing about Liver Rescue
[1105.56 - 1108.56] the one thing about this book The one
[1107.08 - 1109.92] thing about these radio shows that are
[1108.56 - 1112.24] based on Liver Rescue if you don't have
[1109.92 - 1113.48] a copy you really should get one you
[1112.24 - 1115.80] really should get
[1113.48 - 1117.28] one I someone said to me the other day
[1115.80 - 1119.16] you just want to sell books oh yeah I
[1117.28 - 1121.40] just want to sell books sure that'll
[1119.16 - 1123.64] that'll do me real real good too it's
[1121.40 - 1125.12] it'll do everybody else a lot of good
[1123.64 - 1127.72] for
[1125.12 - 1130.44] sure but it it it's not what people
[1127.72 - 1132.20] think it's not all roses and authors
[1130.44 - 1134.36] know that it's not all roses it's not
[1132.20 - 1136.04] how it works if you can't afford a book
[1134.36 - 1137.92] whatever the download is or whatever the
[1136.04 - 1140.84] print print is I don't know what the
[1137.92 - 1141.96] download is 13 14 15 bucks or the print
[1140.84 - 1143.56] or whatever it is you can't afford one
[1141.96 - 1148.56] to go to the library and get
[1143.56 - 1151.16] one what happens is that that um that
[1148.56 - 1154.04] when it comes down to blood and your
[1151.16 - 1156.64] blood the more fat inside the blood
[1154.04 - 1159.12] constantly on an everyday basis a
[1156.64 - 1161.68] barrage of fat that we enter into our
[1159.12 - 1164.00] bloodstream will create that pre- pre
[1161.68 - 1167.56] fatty liver that won't be diagnosed it
[1164.00 - 1169.44] will create that condition now a lot of
[1167.56 - 1171.24] you are probably who cares about fatty
[1169.44 - 1172.80] liver maybe you didn't even want to
[1171.24 - 1174.44] listen to the show because hey I don't
[1172.80 - 1177.20] have fatty liver who cares who even
[1174.44 - 1179.12] gives a crap who cares I mean I I know
[1177.20 - 1180.40] that because because when you talk to
[1179.12 - 1183.84] people about fatty liver they're like oh
[1180.40 - 1189.08] that's not me I don't have any fatty
[1183.84 - 1191.68] liver yeah sure sure because you know
[1189.08 - 1193.60] what happens is that the majority of the
[1191.68 - 1196.72] country has a fatty liver it's in
[1193.60 - 1198.60] different stages that's the whole point
[1196.72 - 1201.16] and why is a fatty liver even B bad why
[1198.60 - 1203.56] is the pre fatty liver even bad it's bad
[1201.16 - 1207.08] because other symptoms and conditions
[1203.56 - 1210.36] you have are based upon that fatty
[1207.08 - 1212.32] liver I mean literally other symptoms
[1210.36 - 1214.72] easily because chronic illness which is
[1212.32 - 1217.84] are like viruses and sign of our liver
[1214.72 - 1219.88] they Prosper they proliferate they grow
[1217.84 - 1221.96] they do their thing because you can have
[1219.88 - 1224.68] a because of the fatty liver and the
[1221.96 - 1227.16] high foot and the high fat in the
[1224.68 - 1231.12] bloodstream and that that that's how it
[1227.16 - 1232.12] works just basic CFS that me CFS chronic
[1231.12 - 1234.20] fatigue
[1232.12 - 1236.08] syndrome that right there if you if
[1234.20 - 1237.44] you're bombarding yourself with fats all
[1236.08 - 1238.92] these years and you end up developing
[1237.44 - 1241.04] Epstein bar related chronic fatigue
[1238.92 - 1243.20] syndrome because that's what it all is
[1241.04 - 1246.04] you end up you you end up developing
[1243.20 - 1248.68] that and then what happens your liver's
[1246.04 - 1250.04] sluggish it's doggish totally sluggish
[1248.68 - 1253.44] not functioning
[1250.04 - 1255.96] good and and it's get it's it's preatty
[1253.44 - 1257.68] and it's all in the way of healing from
[1255.96 - 1259.72] even chronic fatigue syndrome do you see
[1257.68 - 1261.08] how this works Hashim modus thyroiditis
[1259.72 - 1263.08] which is Epstein bar related where the
[1261.08 - 1264.80] Epstein bar virus drills itself into the
[1263.08 - 1265.60] thyroid and gives people gives gives
[1264.80 - 1267.48] people
[1265.60 - 1269.56] hypothyroidism that virus starts out in
[1267.48 - 1271.36] the liver liver gets sluggish gets fatty
[1269.56 - 1274.96] gets pre fatty gets
[1271.36 - 1277.36] doggish and then what happens it it the
[1274.96 - 1280.08] virus you know proliferates it grows it
[1277.36 - 1281.64] moves forward it prospers it lives a
[1280.08 - 1284.28] very good life it drills into other
[1281.64 - 1285.84] glands such as the thyroid and so forth
[1284.28 - 1287.48] I what about multiple sclerosis I'm just
[1285.84 - 1289.24] giving you these basic ones I there so
[1287.48 - 1292.44] there's hundreds ones I could ramble off
[1289.24 - 1294.28] what about multiple sceris Ms same thing
[1292.44 - 1296.72] all starts with a virus in the liver and
[1294.28 - 1298.36] the virus gets doggish the immune system
[1296.72 - 1300.48] in the in in the liver can't fight off
[1298.36 - 1304.00] the virus easy and the liver gets
[1300.48 - 1306.64] sluggish stagnant doggish the whole bit
[1304.00 - 1308.36] and what happens is the virus Prosper
[1306.64 - 1310.60] does its thing creates a whole bunch of
[1308.36 - 1312.16] neurotoxins gives rings off a whole
[1310.60 - 1313.88] bunch of different diagnoses including
[1312.16 - 1315.60] multiple sclerosis including Lyme
[1313.88 - 1318.52] disease the hope it everybody that's
[1315.60 - 1321.64] ever had a diagnosis of lime has a liver
[1318.52 - 1324.20] condition I kid you not every single
[1321.64 - 1326.88] person who's ever had the diagnosis of
[1324.20 - 1329.44] lime whether they had lime not had lime
[1326.88 - 1331.24] or whatever it is has a has a liver
[1329.44 - 1333.60] that's in trouble that needs
[1331.24 - 1336.08] help and when the liver starts getting
[1333.60 - 1338.08] better and you start taking care of it
[1336.08 - 1340.04] then you can get anything better
[1338.08 - 1341.64] anything and everything better how do
[1340.04 - 1345.88] you like that I'm going to say it again
[1341.64 - 1346.68] when the liver gets taken care of when
[1345.88 - 1349.12] it's
[1346.68 - 1351.16] nurtured when it's brought back to
[1349.12 - 1353.20] health even when you don't know it's the
[1351.16 - 1354.88] problem or something's going on inside
[1353.20 - 1356.64] there in the whole bit and it's being
[1354.88 - 1359.88] brought back to health when the liver is
[1356.64 - 1363.56] cared for and coddled and loved and
[1359.88 - 1366.92] treated right any kind of illness is
[1363.56 - 1366.92] possible healing
[1367.40 - 1372.60] anything and it's important to know that
[1370.36 - 1375.08] it's important to know
[1372.60 - 1376.60] that it's about you healing and it's
[1375.08 - 1378.68] about you getting better it's been my
[1376.60 - 1380.36] mission since I was young and the only
[1378.68 - 1382.28] reason why I do the books is so it can
[1380.36 - 1384.72] spread out far and wide and get into
[1382.28 - 1385.76] somebody's hands and to get in
[1384.72 - 1388.08] somebody's
[1385.76 - 1389.76] hands someone said to me the other day

[1412.40 - 1415.16] supplements or this or that it has
[1413.84 - 1417.32] nothing to do with somebody really
[1415.16 - 1420.08] getting better it's about getting the
[1417.32 - 1424.20] information in their hands and and not
[1420.08 - 1426.52] to be derailed by derailed by greed and

[1553.64 - 1558.44] it's all about what can I do for you
[1555.16 - 1562.12] right now so here's the deal
[1558.44 - 1565.28] blood thickness is the deal breaker

[1565.28 - 1570.88] deal breaker that's the liver's deal
[1568.36 - 1573.48] breaker that's the liver's deal breaker
[1570.88 - 1576.52] baby it's the blood
[1573.48 - 1579.56] thickness it breaks the
[1576.52 - 1580.96] liver that's what it does really
[1579.56 - 1582.48] important to know you know what doctors
[1580.96 - 1585.76] are supposed to say when you go into
[1582.48 - 1587.84] when you go into um the doctor's office
[1585.76 - 1589.80] you know what they're supposed to say
[1587.84 - 1591.48] let me give you a window okay this is
[1589.80 - 1595.68] the window so somebody goes into the
[1591.48 - 1599.36] doctor's office all right and and and
[1595.68 - 1603.12] Physicians need they need a simple blood
[1599.36 - 1605.48] test in their possession it would
[1603.12 - 1608.32] literally turn medicine around it
[1605.48 - 1611.16] doesn't exist but it would be a miracle
[1608.32 - 1614.32] if it did a miracle they need a blood
[1611.16 - 1616.40] fat tester that's what they need to
[1614.32 - 1618.44] determine blood fat
[1616.40 - 1619.68] levels you you just you know how like
[1618.44 - 1621.52] when you you know you're doing the blood
[1619.68 - 1623.40] sugar diabetics they need the you know
[1621.52 - 1625.28] you prick the finger literally you just
[1623.40 - 1626.80] need you don't even need it to be like
[1625.28 - 1629.20] that it could be literally something you
[1626.80 - 1632.08] stick under your armpit for a minute to
[1629.20 - 1634.32] determine your blood fat
[1632.08 - 1636.88] ratio and this is different this isn't
[1634.32 - 1640.44] your fat your your your fat ratio like
[1636.88 - 1643.40] if you hop on a scale this is blood fat
[1640.44 - 1645.36] so it would measure it would measure
[1643.40 - 1646.92] okay your blood fat levels just like
[1645.36 - 1648.68] diabetics when they they measure their
[1646.92 - 1650.84] blood glucose Coast
[1648.68 - 1652.56] levels and this is what it's supposed to
[1650.84 - 1655.04] be when you get a physical exam so the
[1652.56 - 1656.56] doctor can instantly say whoa what was
[1655.04 - 1660.48] your last
[1656.56 - 1663.28] meal so yeah what was your last meal
[1660.48 - 1665.64] your blood fat is off the charts what's
[1663.28 - 1667.60] going on here at this is at this rate
[1665.64 - 1670.36] you're going to develop a fatty liver
[1667.60 - 1672.88] gout or heart disease or kidney disease
[1670.36 - 1676.16] or kidney failure for all that high
[1672.88 - 1677.72] fat even if it's healthy diets or trendy
[1676.16 - 1678.80] diets that are healthy that are high fat
[1677.72 - 1679.96] they're not even supposed to be even
[1678.80 - 1681.36] they're just supposed to be like whoo
[1679.96 - 1684.44] what's in your
[1681.36 - 1687.16] blood listen what did you eat last night
[1684.44 - 1688.96] by the way and the person would say well
[1687.16 - 1690.44] I ate at a restaurant last night and I
[1688.96 - 1692.44] ordered chicken with broccoli I thought
[1690.44 - 1694.60] it was a pretty healthy dish chicken
[1692.44 - 1696.28] with broccoli okay well what was
[1694.60 - 1698.84] yesterday's lunch that was yesterday's
[1696.28 - 1701.48] dinner what was yesterday's lunch the
[1698.84 - 1703.32] doctor should say oh I had a turkey club
[1701.48 - 1705.48] on a gluten-free bread on gluten-free
[1703.32 - 1708.28] bread and I really didn't eat much of
[1705.48 - 1711.16] the bread I just kind of ate the turkey
[1708.28 - 1713.36] club little bit of cheese and turkey or
[1711.16 - 1717.08] whatever I thought that was good lots of
[1713.36 - 1719.44] protein right lots of protein okay well
[1717.08 - 1721.72] what was your yesterday's breakfast the
[1719.44 - 1724.44] doctor should ask well let's see I had
[1721.72 - 1726.08] two eggs I had a slice of healthy bacon
[1724.44 - 1728.40] it was free range or it was you know
[1726.08 - 1731.16] farm raised and it was it was a healthy
[1728.40 - 1733.04] bacon and um and I skipped the toast
[1731.16 - 1735.80] because I'm you know decided to be low
[1733.04 - 1737.72] carb have a low carb free
[1735.80 - 1740.20] morning the doctor should should lean
[1737.72 - 1742.92] forward and say that's great you skip
[1740.20 - 1746.04] the toast what we really need to be
[1742.92 - 1747.36] concerned about though is how much fat
[1746.04 - 1750.24] is in your
[1747.36 - 1752.72] diet a simple blood test I just did for
[1750.24 - 1755.04] you is showing high fat in your
[1752.72 - 1756.80] bloodstream and if it's been high fat
[1755.04 - 1759.84] for a very long time because this has
[1756.80 - 1761.32] been your diet and even even worse diet
[1759.84 - 1764.52] even before you're eating kind of
[1761.32 - 1767.04] healthy then we're in trouble so
[1764.52 - 1770.20] recapping all the meals indicates that
[1767.04 - 1771.20] it's always consistently high and you
[1770.20 - 1773.68] know what you're
[1771.20 - 1776.28] doing the doctor should say you're
[1773.68 - 1778.80] starving your liver of oxygen you're
[1776.28 - 1780.72] setting the stage for cancer you're
[1778.80 - 1783.28] setting the stage for illness and
[1780.72 - 1785.36] disease yes you're setting the stage for
[1783.28 - 1790.00] cancer even on a healthy high fat High
[1785.36 - 1791.96] trendy diet that's right that's right
[1790.00 - 1794.84] you don't have to eat wheat of course
[1791.96 - 1796.04] good job doctor should say you don't
[1794.84 - 1798.56] have to have
[1796.04 - 1800.16] wheat exactly exactly but maybe you
[1798.56 - 1802.60] should bring in a little bit more leafy
[1800.16 - 1803.92] greens a little bit more fruit and the
[1802.60 - 1806.08] person might say well I'm not on any
[1803.92 - 1807.76] fruit I'm I can't eat any fruit I'm I'm
[1806.08 - 1810.96] not allowed to have fruit I don't want
[1807.76 - 1812.96] to get diabetes I don't want
[1810.96 - 1814.24] fruit and you should actually doctor
[1812.96 - 1816.48] should say you should even try some
[1814.24 - 1818.92] healthy carbohydrates clean
[1816.48 - 1821.08] ones and some more extra
[1818.92 - 1823.84] vegetables that's how the medical world
[1821.08 - 1824.72] should work on planet Earth planet Earth
[1823.84 - 1827.04] is
[1824.72 - 1830.32] backwards it's backwards when it comes
[1827.04 - 1831.92] down to the health of the human race it
[1830.32 - 1833.48] always has been don't get me wrong
[1831.92 - 1835.68] there's life-saving technology and
[1833.48 - 1837.76] life-saving Medicine absolutely you
[1835.68 - 1841.32] better believe it but I'm talking about
[1837.76 - 1843.84] chronic illness whole different
[1841.32 - 1846.56] thing whole different
[1843.84 - 1849.04] thing okay big difference it's like lamb
[1846.56 - 1851.12] and chicken big
[1849.04 - 1854.08] difference I'm just straight I'm just
[1851.12 - 1854.96] saying it straight so you know the whole
[1854.08 - 1858.72] thing
[1854.96 - 1860.68] is the doctor should have the concern
[1858.72 - 1864.76] that it shouldn't be about the sugar and
[1860.68 - 1866.12] the carbs it should be about the fat and
[1864.76 - 1867.24] it shouldn't be about fruit being
[1866.12 - 1868.56] eliminated you don't want the fruit
[1867.24 - 1870.40] eliminated I mean that should be a
[1868.56 - 1873.80] concern you don't want fruit eliminated
[1870.40 - 1875.56] sadly blaming sugar as the cause of even
[1873.80 - 1877.32] a fatty liver is a huge mistake in the
[1875.56 - 1880.48] health industry right
[1877.32 - 1883.20] now this mistake exists because sugar is
[1880.48 - 1886.48] never eaten on its own it's always eaten
[1883.20 - 1889.04] with fat once again causing problems
[1886.48 - 1892.36] it's not the sugar that's the
[1889.04 - 1895.56] problem see fat and sugar are always
[1892.36 - 1897.40] eaten together so then all the so-called
[1895.56 - 1899.32] experts are like get rid of the sugar
[1897.40 - 1900.96] and they see improvements temporarily in
[1899.32 - 1902.28] a lot of people but they're still
[1900.96 - 1903.60] getting fatty liver and they're going to
[1902.28 - 1904.84] still get sick down the road and they're
[1903.60 - 1906.48] still going to get chronic illness down
[1904.84 - 1907.52] the road even on the most trendiest nice
[1906.48 - 1910.92] clean
[1907.52 - 1913.20] diets because the problem was sugar and
[1910.92 - 1915.48] fat together and it really hurts the
[1913.20 - 1917.64] liver that's what it really is and it's
[1915.48 - 1919.96] not the sugar part it's the fat part
[1917.64 - 1922.92] that's the irony but the sugar gets the
[1919.96 - 1926.08] blame unbelievable if this is too
[1922.92 - 1929.12] mind-blowing for you listen to the show
[1926.08 - 1931.08] again listen to it again until a little
[1929.12 - 1934.56] voice of reason pops up
[1931.08 - 1937.12] somewhere and says you know what you're
[1934.56 - 1940.04] right how why would you fill your blood
[1937.12 - 1941.28] blood with fat Non-Stop and starve your
[1940.04 - 1944.40] blood of
[1941.28 - 1946.20] oxygen and and yeah and fatten up the
[1944.40 - 1948.56] liver so it becomes more dysfunctional
[1946.20 - 1951.64] and Miss more dysfunction over time why
[1948.56 - 1953.12] would you do that when fat actually in
[1951.64 - 1954.88] the bloodstream starves the bloodstream
[1953.12 - 1956.56] of oxygen in the organs of oxygen and
[1954.88 - 1960.00] the daily basis every day of your life
[1956.56 - 1963.16] making you age and then with all that
[1960.00 - 1965.60] getting pathogens like bacteria strep E
[1963.16 - 1968.04] coli that's just the name a couple and
[1965.60 - 1971.36] if you're into lime bacteria is whatever
[1968.04 - 1973.16] then sure lime bacteria will Thrive
[1971.36 - 1974.76] first of all Lyme disease is viral just
[1973.16 - 1977.00] read my book medical medium learn the
[1974.76 - 1980.16] truth and before you throw rotten Tom
[1977.00 - 1984.72] Tomatoes at me and and and try and to
[1980.16 - 1986.88] and try to light light my apartment on
[1984.72 - 1989.84] fire make sure you read the book so you
[1986.88 - 1992.76] know the truth about lime anything can
[1989.84 - 1995.80] prosper in the BL blood that's pathogen
[1992.76 - 2000.04] pathogenic viruses bacteria when the
[1995.80 - 2001.92] blood fat is high anything it's not just
[2000.04 - 2003.60] about stupid fatty liver and I say
[2001.92 - 2005.36] stupid fatty liver because yeah like
[2003.60 - 2007.04] fatty liver you guys like oh who's got a
[2005.36 - 2008.80] fatty liver who's got a fatty liver
[2007.04 - 2010.44] isn't that for older people they finally
[2008.80 - 2015.00] get diagnosed with a fatty liver oh
[2010.44 - 2018.28] that's not me no no no it's way bigger
[2015.00 - 2020.72] than that it's way bigger than that and
[2018.28 - 2022.76] the fact is we do eat sugar with fat all
[2020.72 - 2025.72] the time happens all the
[2022.76 - 2027.60] time so when you think about it it's
[2025.72 - 2031.16] always it's like it's an unhealthy fat
[2027.60 - 2033.24] too sometimes in many in many different
[2031.16 - 2035.64] situations no one's sitting around
[2033.24 - 2038.64] eating gobs of Standalone sugar they're
[2035.64 - 2040.80] mixing it in coffee and cream they're
[2038.64 - 2043.16] having it in cakes and cookies and
[2040.80 - 2046.00] pastries along with fat in every last
[2043.16 - 2049.32] one of those it's in barbecue sauce
[2046.00 - 2051.76] which goes on pulled pork which is fat
[2049.32 - 2054.52] that's sugar and fat it's eaten As a
[2051.76 - 2057.32] treat such as candy cane a candy cane
[2054.52 - 2059.08] after a high-fat Festival meal not
[2057.32 - 2061.48] acknowledging that sugar is always
[2059.08 - 2063.00] consumed with fat is a prime example of
[2061.48 - 2064.76] both the conventional medical and
[2063.00 - 2066.92] Alternative Health Industries operating
[2064.76 - 2067.88] with blinders on basically the AL
[2066.92 - 2069.84] alternative industry and the
[2067.88 - 2072.44] conventional industry is
[2069.84 - 2074.92] blind they have tunnel vision that only
[2072.44 - 2077.28] allows sugar into view but not fat which
[2074.92 - 2081.24] is protein and that's the problem and
[2077.28 - 2084.96] when a theory is seen from that limited
[2081.24 - 2086.72] perspective it's easily becoming law and
[2084.96 - 2088.48] you'll see it on all the doctor shows
[2086.72 - 2090.52] you'll see it on all the whatever you'll
[2088.48 - 2093.16] see it on all the channels and the
[2090.52 - 2094.92] networks it's all about oh carbs and get
[2093.16 - 2097.80] rid of your sugar oh drop all that
[2094.92 - 2100.40] you'll see it it's like a virus
[2097.80 - 2102.24] itself and just protein protein no
[2100.40 - 2103.72] they're not saying it's fat fat
[2102.24 - 2105.44] protein's fat and just bringing and
[2103.72 - 2108.64] bringing and I'm not saying you have to
[2105.44 - 2110.72] live in a box and not ever have if
[2108.64 - 2112.56] you're into animal protein not ever have
[2110.72 - 2114.00] some animal protein if you're into if
[2112.56 - 2115.72] you're into if you're vegan or something
[2114.00 - 2118.24] in in plant-based not having avocado
[2115.72 - 2120.28] it's not about that it's about the fact
[2118.24 - 2121.52] of how many years and especially if
[2120.28 - 2123.32] you're chronically ill if you want to
[2121.52 - 2124.96] get better you got to stop the fats for
[2123.32 - 2126.56] sure you got to lower the fats maybe
[2124.96 - 2128.28] even stop them completely shut them down
[2126.56 - 2129.72] and learn how to eat without it I give
[2128.28 - 2134.28] the answers in all the books how to eat
[2129.72 - 2135.76] fat free I do I do and maybe it's about
[2134.28 - 2137.24] that if you're chronic Le because I've
[2135.76 - 2138.72] seen it save lives and turn around
[2137.24 - 2140.68] people's lives that never could heal
[2138.72 - 2142.64] from any kind of lime never could heal
[2140.68 - 2144.80] from any kind of Ms never could heal
[2142.64 - 2146.24] from anything serious chronic fatigue
[2144.80 - 2148.48] syndrome for so many years never could
[2146.24 - 2150.24] heal from anything and they got fat free
[2148.48 - 2152.56] they got fat free doing lots of leafy
[2150.24 - 2154.24] greens lots of celery juice lots of
[2152.56 - 2156.64] fruit they brought it in and it turned
[2154.24 - 2158.12] their lives around and they got better
[2156.64 - 2161.28] and and they started building muscle and
[2158.12 - 2163.96] they got out of they got out of the bed
[2161.28 - 2166.72] that's right that's right no other diet
[2163.96 - 2169.60] could have done it and didn't do it no
[2166.72 - 2170.76] other diet but I get it the trendy diets
[2169.60 - 2172.40] are the people that are living their
[2170.76 - 2173.88] life feeling relatively kind of good
[2172.40 - 2175.88] just got a little weight on them they
[2173.88 - 2177.88] take out the processed foods knock out
[2175.88 - 2180.36] all that get on some trendy exercise
[2177.88 - 2184.56] program and they think they struck gold
[2180.36 - 2187.52] Eureka no no no no no it doesn't work
[2184.56 - 2193.24] like that it doesn't
[2187.52 - 2196.24] so so sugar with fat you guys is the
[2193.24 - 2198.64] problem and when it's healthier sugar
[2196.24 - 2201.48] with healthier fat it's less of a
[2198.64 - 2204.84] problem but still a
[2201.48 - 2207.04] problem and so the fats have to lower or
[2204.84 - 2208.96] get reduced so they're not saturating
[2207.04 - 2210.56] the bloodstream you have fats once a day
[2208.96 - 2212.80] if you're into you know some animal
[2210.56 - 2216.12] protein eat animal protein once every
[2212.80 - 2220.24] other day and learn how to eat more
[2216.12 - 2221.80] sweet potatoes learn how to eat more you
[2220.24 - 2224.92] know bring in more leafy greens
[2221.80 - 2228.36] cucumbers red bell pepper sweet potato
[2224.92 - 2231.32] yes all of those things learn how to
[2228.36 - 2233.04] bring in other Foods you know bring in
[2231.32 - 2234.56] yeah bring in bring in you can bring in
[2233.04 - 2236.48] a whole bunch of bringing even bring in
[2234.56 - 2238.88] avocado avocado is lower fat believe it
[2236.48 - 2241.00] or not so one thing the vegans and the
[2238.88 - 2243.36] the vegans have is that when they do
[2241.00 - 2247.16] high fat like the avocado it's still
[2243.36 - 2248.36] lower than than animal protein fat which
[2247.16 - 2250.60] which makes it so they could eat a
[2248.36 - 2252.12] little bit more often unless they're
[2250.60 - 2253.64] really struggling with an illness then
[2252.12 - 2256.08] just fat free is
[2253.64 - 2257.64] important but when you're animal protein
[2256.08 - 2259.04] you bring the animal proteins down hey
[2257.64 - 2260.40] if you're vegan you're vegan and plant-
[2259.04 - 2261.84] based you bring all those nuts and seeds
[2260.40 - 2263.80] down you bring those oils down too you
[2261.84 - 2265.36] bring all that down too you have to you
[2263.80 - 2267.24] have to when you get rid of you can get
[2265.36 - 2270.12] the liver cleaned
[2267.24 - 2271.44] up and sure you can have some fats once
[2270.12 - 2273.56] in a while and you can use it under the
[2271.44 - 2275.64] GU of protein people are in like denial
[2273.56 - 2278.40] they think protein has no fat in it it's
[2275.64 - 2280.16] unbelievable they think protein has no
[2278.40 - 2282.00] fat in it they think protein's protein
[2280.16 - 2284.12] there's no fat in it it's not
[2282.00 - 2285.92] true I mean it's just it's it's
[2284.12 - 2287.56] unbelievable seen a commercial where
[2285.92 - 2289.56] this little snack pack it's got pieces
[2287.56 - 2291.16] of ham pieces of cheese and and and some
[2289.56 - 2292.88] almonds in the snack pack you rip it
[2291.16 - 2294.56] open and what did they say they just
[2292.88 - 2297.52] called it a protein pack are you kidding
[2294.56 - 2299.16] me it was a fat pack it was a fat pack
[2297.52 - 2301.08] an overt fat pack I've never seen
[2299.16 - 2302.56] anything like it cheese straight fat
[2301.08 - 2304.48] plus sugar inside of it which is the
[2302.56 - 2307.48] lactose which is a diabetic
[2304.48 - 2309.08] Nightmare and and it illness and disease
[2307.48 - 2311.80] causing nightmare because cheese feeds
[2309.08 - 2313.88] every virus Under the Sun every virus
[2311.80 - 2316.32] there is that causes all the different
[2313.88 - 2318.96] autoimmune diseases every single lupus
[2316.32 - 2321.60] every single whatever every single skin
[2318.96 - 2324.40] condition every single condition you
[2321.60 - 2327.88] name it connected to connective tissue
[2324.40 - 2330.52] disease everything it causes and That
[2327.88 - 2333.12] Snack Pack had pieces of
[2330.52 - 2335.72] ham or pieces of turkey you had an
[2333.12 - 2337.52] option it had some almonds in one little
[2335.72 - 2340.28] container a three containers like a
[2337.52 - 2344.96] three pack or four pack I had some
[2340.28 - 2347.48] cheese it had some cheese squares turkey
[2344.96 - 2350.80] squares and and some almonds and it was
[2347.48 - 2353.60] called a protein pack and that's how the
[2350.80 - 2355.88] brainwashing occurs it's unbelievable
[2353.60 - 2358.56] that was a fat pack keep your blood fat
[2355.88 - 2360.84] nice and thick stay off of fruits though
[2358.56 - 2362.08] because you don't want to get diabetes
[2360.84 - 2363.96] stay off of the very thing it has
[2362.08 - 2365.76] antioxidants that bring blood to the
[2363.96 - 2367.32] bloodstream how do you like that that
[2365.76 - 2370.76] actually keep
[2367.32 - 2372.60] that actually help Drive oxygen that you
[2370.76 - 2375.32] inhaled in your
[2372.60 - 2377.20] lungs and when we breathe oxygen and
[2375.32 - 2380.52] it's filled the pollutants every single
[2377.20 - 2382.48] day like it is those antioxidants and a
[2380.52 - 2384.60] piece of fruit help to block those
[2382.48 - 2386.36] pollutant so the oxygen gets clean it's
[2384.60 - 2388.84] clean and it goes into the bloodstream
[2386.36 - 2391.52] clean that little fat pack the person
[2388.84 - 2393.16] had on the TV commercial with the little
[2391.52 - 2395.08] squares of turkey and the little squares
[2393.16 - 2397.32] of cheese and and and the almonds that
[2395.08 - 2399.48] fat pack does nothing for for that you
[2397.32 - 2402.12] you you all that does is cause oxygen to
[2399.48 - 2404.48] diminish in your in your in your body
[2402.12 - 2405.96] and stay dirty and keep the blood dirty
[2404.48 - 2408.76] and keep the blood dehydrated which is
[2405.96 - 2412.16] the next point if your blood Fat's too
[2408.76 - 2414.04] high if it's too high you got the least
[2412.16 - 2416.16] amount of oxygen in there but you got Le
[2414.04 - 2419.72] you got the least amount of water it
[2416.16 - 2420.76] pushes water out in a bad way it makes
[2419.72 - 2422.60] you
[2420.76 - 2424.84] dehydrated and that gives you an
[2422.60 - 2427.40] illusion of losing weight when people go
[2424.84 - 2428.80] on these high-fat diets they actually
[2427.40 - 2430.28] don't know these high protein high fat
[2428.80 - 2431.60] diets no carbs and they're not doing any
[2430.28 - 2433.40] fresh
[2431.60 - 2435.16] fruit with with they're getting
[2433.40 - 2436.80] dehydrated and they're like whoa I'm
[2435.16 - 2438.48] actually losing weight really quick out
[2436.80 - 2440.44] of nowhere no you're not losing fat
[2438.48 - 2442.48] really quick out of nowhere you're
[2440.44 - 2444.08] losing water weight and you end up
[2442.48 - 2445.76] getting dehydrated it's a whole another
[2444.08 - 2448.00] thing the higher the fat is in the
[2445.76 - 2449.80] bloodstream on a daily basis the less
[2448.00 - 2452.84] water in there and the liver needs water
[2449.80 - 2455.52] to cleanse it it needs oxygen to keep it
[2452.84 - 2458.04] alive because the bloodstream driving
[2455.52 - 2460.24] straight into your your liver is low in
[2458.04 - 2461.76] oxygen naturally it has very little
[2460.24 - 2463.52] oxygen in it and it's filled with
[2461.76 - 2465.16] poisons toxins and then really good
[2463.52 - 2466.12] nutrients going into that bloodstream
[2465.16 - 2467.80] and it's going in the liver and the
[2466.12 - 2469.64] liver has to sort it all out and when
[2467.80 - 2471.60] the liver has to sort it all out with a
[2469.64 - 2474.96] big pile of fat in the bloodstream thick
[2471.60 - 2476.40] blood fill the fat going into that liver
[2474.96 - 2478.04] and it has to store it out to try to get
[2476.40 - 2480.72] nutrients out to find try to find
[2478.04 - 2482.36] Precious Precious valuable glucose
[2480.72 - 2484.28] somewhere to keep it alive so the liver
[2482.36 - 2485.72] can keep alive so the liver can send
[2484.28 - 2487.32] that glucose right up to the heart and
[2485.72 - 2488.88] then up to the brain because guess what
[2487.32 - 2489.76] your brain runs on sugar it doesn't run
[2488.88 - 2493.68] on
[2489.76 - 2496.40] fat your brain has traces the tiniest
[2493.68 - 2498.80] traces of omegas in there and guess what
[2496.40 - 2501.24] you can get those from a pack of
[2498.80 - 2503.92] blackberries the brain is made out of
[2501.24 - 2506.00] sugar glucose glycogen it shrinks on
[2503.92 - 2508.80] people because of years and years and
[2506.00 - 2511.76] years of having fat in the
[2508.80 - 2513.68] bloodstream and it's a brain shrinker it
[2511.76 - 2516.32] shrinks the
[2513.68 - 2517.80] brain high fat high protein no matter
[2516.32 - 2519.40] what it is whether it's a vegan diet
[2517.80 - 2521.08] whether it's a paleo diet whether it's a
[2519.40 - 2523.68] hell just come up with a new name and
[2521.08 - 2525.08] there are some new names out there for
[2523.68 - 2527.12] diets I'm not going to I'm not going to
[2525.08 - 2528.80] mention the names cuz it's like you know
[2527.12 - 2530.48] I'm not trying to attack any personal
[2528.80 - 2533.16] doctors and other people I I'm not it's
[2530.48 - 2534.88] not about attacking people it's the same
[2533.16 - 2536.52] kind of thing it's all the same stuff
[2534.88 - 2539.04] it's a trendy high fat High you know
[2536.52 - 2542.80] high protein diets it's not like
[2539.04 - 2545.60] whatever but what it is is it's a brain
[2542.80 - 2548.60] shrinker diet that's what it is cuz your
[2545.60 - 2552.32] brain is glycogen stored glycogen
[2548.60 - 2555.04] stored it's sugar it has to be it's the
[2552.32 - 2557.72] only way to keep the brain cool it's the
[2555.04 - 2562.20] only way to keep it cool so it doesn't
[2557.72 - 2565.24] burn up it doesn't burn
[2562.20 - 2569.24] up the concern about fevers is that they
[2565.24 - 2571.56] cook the brain that's what in medicine
[2569.24 - 2573.72] the concern is it's a very good
[2571.56 - 2578.16] concern because you don't want to cook
[2573.72 - 2578.16] the brain and that's with fevers
[2578.20 - 2582.80] the brain is a delicate delicate
[2580.32 - 2585.92] delicate thing and it's filled with
[2582.80 - 2587.92] glucose to protect it so it doesn't cook
[2585.92 - 2589.92] the glucose diminishes over time in the
[2587.92 - 2592.16] brain of somebody and they're on a
[2589.92 - 2595.08] chronic high-fat diet all the time for
[2592.16 - 2597.08] many years and the liver sluggish or
[2595.08 - 2598.52] doggish or whatever it is turns into
[2597.08 - 2601.48] pref fatty liver whatever it is it
[2598.52 - 2604.44] doesn't whatever would happens is the
[2601.48 - 2609.56] brain suffers over time as the years and
[2604.44 - 2609.56] years go on and the Brain
[2609.60 - 2613.20] atrophies but you wouldn't know when
[2611.72 - 2615.24] you're just like okay you're eating bad
[2613.20 - 2616.96] anyway then you pop onto a trendy high
[2615.24 - 2618.04] fat diet with high protein diet and you
[2616.96 - 2620.28] think you're doing stuff you're good and
[2618.04 - 2622.40] you are it's a stage it's a step but it
[2620.28 - 2624.72] doesn't stop there and you got to learn
[2622.40 - 2627.56] one vital vital thing critical thing one
[2624.72 - 2631.12] vital critical thing you got to lower
[2627.56 - 2633.60] the fats whatever diet you subscribe to
[2631.12 - 2636.52] you have to lower the
[2633.60 - 2638.68] fats you I don't take sides because it's
[2636.52 - 2641.60] not about taking sides it's about
[2638.68 - 2643.24] delivering you the information that no
[2641.60 - 2646.32] one else
[2643.24 - 2648.40] has and you need that
[2646.32 - 2651.68] information if you don't need it you
[2648.40 - 2652.72] don't think you need it fine fine that's
[2651.68 - 2656.12] fine with
[2652.72 - 2658.64] me it's all right I respect that totally
[2656.12 - 2661.08] respect that and you can kick dirt in my
[2658.64 - 2662.24] face too man I'm pretty tough I totally
[2661.08 - 2664.80] respect
[2662.24 - 2666.52] that but I would take the information
[2664.80 - 2669.92] work on your healing process move
[2666.52 - 2671.36] forward bite the bullet work on it do it
[2669.92 - 2674.84] that's what I would
[2671.36 - 2677.48] do blood fat stops oxygen it stops
[2674.84 - 2678.72] oxygen it dehydrates you it stops water
[2677.48 - 2681.28] it stops
[2678.72 - 2683.04] water it's not possible to lock down a
[2681.28 - 2685.64] standard oxygen percentage of blood
[2683.04 - 2688.04] entering the liver because it depends on
[2685.64 - 2689.92] what somebody's eating science and
[2688.04 - 2693.64] research will never be able to know the
[2689.92 - 2695.64] percentage of oxygen that's going inside
[2693.64 - 2697.12] the liver with the blood that heads up
[2695.64 - 2699.12] heads up up the highway the hepatic
[2697.12 - 2702.24] portal vein right into the liver they'll
[2699.12 - 2703.36] never be able to determine this because
[2702.24 - 2704.92] everybody's eating different and
[2703.36 - 2707.52] everybody's on these high fat diets so
[2704.92 - 2708.92] it's going to ratio different this is
[2707.52 - 2710.40] all advanced stuff by the way in the
[2708.92 - 2712.16] liver rescue book I mean science that
[2710.40 - 2714.04] even know that they're not even thinking
[2712.16 - 2716.68] to do something like that and they
[2714.04 - 2718.76] should maybe 30 years they'll have that
[2716.68 - 2720.96] test that's what I mean by being
[2718.76 - 2724.76] Advanced it's the whole
[2720.96 - 2726.44] point so that's the whole deal is you've
[2724.76 - 2727.92] got to be careful with that much of the
[2726.44 - 2732.12] rest of the blood entering through
[2727.92 - 2734.52] thetic portal vein is carrying toxins
[2732.12 - 2736.68] pathogens viruses
[2734.52 - 2738.96] Pharmaceuticals minerals vitamins
[2736.68 - 2741.40] enzymes amino acids antioxidants
[2738.96 - 2743.20] phytochemicals from plants and Foods
[2741.40 - 2745.36] nutrients fats and more if you're eating
[2743.20 - 2747.60] fruit lots of
[2745.36 - 2750.00] antioxidants but people aren't eating a
[2747.60 - 2752.12] lot of antioxidants they're not they're
[2750.00 - 2753.32] just not so they're not getting a lot of
[2752.12 - 2754.88] good minerals and vitamins and
[2753.32 - 2757.24] antioxidants up into the liver so that's
[2754.88 - 2760.40] a whole problem all on its own
[2757.24 - 2763.32] so fat thickens the
[2760.40 - 2768.36] blood and that's the thing we have to be
[2763.32 - 2770.88] scared about it matters it really
[2768.36 - 2772.32] does so the central nervous system runs
[2770.88 - 2774.40] on sugar I'm going to tell you right now
[2772.32 - 2777.44] it runs on glucose the central nervous
[2774.40 - 2779.88] system drinks glucose the brain is the
[2777.44 - 2784.32] central nervous system it drinks n it
[2779.88 - 2787.24] drinks all of the new glucose produced
[2784.32 - 2790.28] delivered into the body and old storage
[2787.24 - 2793.00] of of of glucose in the liver the liver
[2790.28 - 2795.48] keeps the brain Alive by releasing
[2793.00 - 2798.12] glucose constantly at different times
[2795.48 - 2800.28] when someone isn't eating right to keep
[2798.12 - 2802.32] your brain from atrophying this is
[2800.28 - 2804.96] highly Advanced
[2802.32 - 2806.24] information the central central nervous
[2804.96 - 2810.88] system
[2806.24 - 2814.60] drinks drinks glucose every cell in a
[2810.88 - 2817.60] nerve every nerve cell needs glucose or
[2814.60 - 2820.44] it dies
[2817.60 - 2823.40] very important right there and when the
[2820.44 - 2826.12] blood fat is high it loses its
[2823.40 - 2827.84] opportunity slowly and painfully every
[2826.12 - 2830.56] single day of somebody's life when
[2827.84 - 2832.96] they're eating all that high
[2830.56 - 2836.36] fat that's the kind of deal we're
[2832.96 - 2840.12] talking about so it's really
[2836.36 - 2843.52] important as long as it's seemingly a
[2840.12 - 2846.48] seemingly new trendy everyday diet
[2843.52 - 2848.68] consists of higher levels the fats which
[2846.48 - 2852.12] is under the GU of protein the hidden gu
[2848.68 - 2855.44] of protein as the main calorie Source it
[2852.12 - 2857.32] will burden the liver probably and
[2855.44 - 2859.48] almost possibly resulting in an
[2857.32 - 2860.80] undiagnosed pre fatty liver or fatty
[2859.48 - 2862.76] liver
[2860.80 - 2864.48] condition regardless of whether
[2862.76 - 2866.64] someone's exercising and doesn't have a
[2864.48 - 2868.36] scrap on their body a fat doesn't have a
[2866.64 - 2869.76] scrap on the outside of their body you
[2868.36 - 2872.24] know of of
[2869.76 - 2873.64] fat you still can have that pre fatty
[2872.24 - 2875.08] and fatty liver and it'll catch up to
[2873.64 - 2876.48] you later on no matter what and give you
[2875.08 - 2878.36] a heart attack that's the whole thing
[2876.48 - 2880.32] too cuz it can and it will it give you a
[2878.36 - 2881.12] stroke I talk about this in a lot of
[2880.32 - 2884.52] radio
[2881.12 - 2886.64] shows lots of people athletes just
[2884.52 - 2889.32] Strokes why are they getting strokes The
[2886.64 - 2892.20] Blood fat is so thick that's
[2889.32 - 2896.16] why and it's it's amazing how it works
[2892.20 - 2899.28] the liver blood vessels constricted with
[2896.16 - 2904.60] fat burdened overburdened
[2899.28 - 2905.80] so our livers can sense what we eat I
[2904.60 - 2907.84] got to tell you something pretty
[2905.80 - 2910.04] interesting your stomach is stupid our
[2907.84 - 2912.56] stomachs are stupid that's the stupidest
[2910.04 - 2914.72] organ in the body science of research
[2912.56 - 2917.24] doesn't know this yet it's the dumbest
[2914.72 - 2919.56] organ in the body it has to be if it
[2917.24 - 2922.44] wasn't we'd be in
[2919.56 - 2925.12] trouble if it was smart if your stomach
[2922.44 - 2927.84] was smart we'd be in trouble because we
[2925.12 - 2928.84] don't have a lot of resources this the
[2927.84 - 2931.60] body
[2928.84 - 2933.32] knows the body knows we're created in a
[2931.60 - 2934.80] way because we might be eating different
[2933.32 - 2936.44] things that we're not supposed to eat to
[2934.80 - 2938.72] survive we might be having that
[2936.44 - 2940.36] barbecued chicken we might be having
[2938.72 - 2942.40] whatever it is we might be having
[2940.36 - 2944.96] something at the wrong time we might be
[2942.40 - 2946.96] having some kind of greasy oily meal we
[2944.96 - 2949.88] might be having something we might be
[2946.96 - 2952.32] having a bunch of eggs that aren't good
[2949.88 - 2954.80] for us but we're surviving and it's what
[2952.32 - 2956.92] we need to eat because we have no other
[2954.80 - 2958.44] options or we're living on a different
[2956.92 - 2960.68] part of the planet we have no money no
[2958.44 - 2962.32] resources or we're living here in the US
[2960.68 - 2964.76] no money no resources we're just eating
[2962.32 - 2967.60] to survive and we're eating all kinds of
[2964.76 - 2971.72] different things the stomach has to stay
[2967.60 - 2975.12] Stupid it has to and the liver stays
[2971.72 - 2976.92] smart that's how it works and there's a
[2975.12 - 2980.32] reason for that there's lots of reasons
[2976.92 - 2982.72] for that the stomach is just a pouch
[2980.32 - 2986.00] that gets its marching orders from your
[2982.72 - 2988.88] brain that's the whole point it's an
[2986.00 - 2992.52] important tool it's an amazing tool the
[2988.88 - 2995.00] stomach is am it's an amazing organ it's
[2992.52 - 2996.84] unbelievable but it should not sense
[2995.00 - 2998.88] what we eat eat and give us too many
[2996.84 - 3000.84] fore warnings cuz if it does it cheats
[2998.88 - 3003.68] us out of surviving on planet Earth we
[3000.84 - 3008.56] don't have a lot of options many of
[3003.68 - 3011.80] us but the liver is so smart it knows
[3008.56 - 3014.08] what you ate 10 days ago and It prepares
[3011.80 - 3017.48] itself in case you eat it again how
[3014.08 - 3018.92] about them apples how about them apples
[3017.48 - 3020.52] your liver is so smart and science
[3018.92 - 3022.32] research has no clue to this this is not
[3020.52 - 3025.60] information they have on any level it's
[3022.32 - 3028.92] so smart it knows if you eat Friday
[3025.60 - 3031.32] night pizza and it gets ready to produce
[3028.92 - 3035.80] the bile needed to try to break down all
[3031.32 - 3038.96] that cheese fat and oil on Friday
[3035.80 - 3040.64] nights even so when you skip that pizza
[3038.96 - 3043.04] on Friday night and decide to eat a
[3040.64 - 3044.92] healthy salad it pumps out all this bile
[3043.04 - 3046.56] cuz it's used to you actually eating
[3044.92 - 3049.04] pizza on that Friday night every Friday
[3046.56 - 3051.44] night and you'll it just bile will come
[3049.04 - 3052.80] out it's another confusing reason why
[3051.44 - 3054.80] people say well I just can't eat all
[3052.80 - 3056.08] these vegetables or can't even because
[3054.80 - 3059.16] they're they're they're their their
[3056.08 - 3061.92] liver was trained being smart trying to
[3059.16 - 3064.68] think ahead of you to actually put out
[3061.92 - 3066.40] bile to help you and break down and
[3064.68 - 3068.84] disperse those fats to save your life
[3066.40 - 3071.12] and your pancreas is
[3068.84 - 3073.04] life and to try to thin out the blood
[3071.12 - 3074.80] the best it's in capacity best its
[3073.04 - 3076.80] capacity can to make sure you don't
[3074.80 - 3079.40] stroke out someday because the liver
[3076.80 - 3082.48] thinks it's smart a stomach stupid the
[3079.40 - 3086.12] liver is really really really
[3082.48 - 3088.36] smart if you eat a cheeseburger big old
[3086.12 - 3090.20] juicy greasy cheeseburger or a healthy
[3088.36 - 3091.72] cheeseburger once a year on your
[3090.20 - 3093.52] birthday your liver will actually
[3091.72 - 3096.12] documented recorded have it in its
[3093.52 - 3099.00] information base and in it cells and not
[3096.12 - 3102.68] forget it and actually prepare
[3099.00 - 3105.00] itself on that 365
[3102.68 - 3108.04] day of the
[3105.00 - 3110.48] year that's the power of the liver but
[3108.04 - 3113.72] we don't treat it good we treat it like
[3110.48 - 3116.56] crap we do and it's not our fault at all
[3113.72 - 3119.84] it's not it's not our fault and it's not
[3116.56 - 3121.20] the trendy doctors that you know don't
[3119.84 - 3124.68] know what the hell to feed anybody
[3121.20 - 3126.64] really in the end it's not it's not it's
[3124.68 - 3128.80] not anybody's fault it's not their fault
[3126.64 - 3133.36] it's not anybody's
[3128.80 - 3136.12] fault but knowing the truth is how you
[3133.36 - 3139.24] can actually turn everything around but
[3136.12 - 3141.84] if you avoid the truth then it's your
[3139.24 - 3144.56] fault then it's your fault then it's our
[3141.84 - 3146.40] fault if you avoid the truth if you
[3144.56 - 3148.68] avoid the information
[3146.40 - 3150.28] to do something about it and it could
[3148.68 - 3152.44] become your
[3150.28 - 3153.68] fault and maybe it's not your fault in
[3152.44 - 3155.20] the end anyway cuz there's so much
[3153.68 - 3157.12] misinformation out there derailing
[3155.20 - 3159.40] everybody so you know what yeah I'm
[3157.12 - 3162.92] wrong about that and I apologize
[3159.40 - 3164.28] terribly wrong actually terribly wrong
[3162.92 - 3165.80] because it's so hard out there and the
[3164.28 - 3168.64] misinformation is so thick you can't
[3165.80 - 3172.24] even cut through it with a
[3168.64 - 3174.96] knife so yeah the bottom line is your
[3172.24 - 3177.96] liver we got to take care of it we got
[3174.96 - 3179.48] to avoid fatty liver I don't even know
[3177.96 - 3181.04] who's going to listen to the show I know
[3179.48 - 3182.88] lots of people listen thousands listen
[3181.04 - 3184.88] to the show I get it but I don't even
[3182.88 - 3186.12] know if people are interested in fatty
[3184.88 - 3187.64] liver when I was going to do this show I
[3186.12 - 3188.52] was like who's who's interested they
[3187.64 - 3190.28] probably think they're going to get a
[3188.52 - 3191.96] fatty liver when they're 50 60 years old
[3190.28 - 3194.32] who's going to listen to this
[3191.96 - 3196.40] show but it's one of the most important
[3194.32 - 3197.96] shows that's the irony that's the irony
[3196.40 - 3199.32] of Health that's the irony of what's
[3197.96 - 3200.56] going on in our health and what's going
[3199.32 - 3202.92] on in our
[3200.56 - 3204.16] lives and so we got to think about all
[3202.92 - 3206.68] these
[3204.16 - 3208.76] things so the bottom line is the
[3206.68 - 3211.00] pancreas needs to be protected by the
[3208.76 - 3212.56] liver so we always got to think about
[3211.00 - 3214.56] that because the liver protects it
[3212.56 - 3217.76] protects you from
[3214.56 - 3220.92] diabetes by trying to keep the glucose
[3217.76 - 3223.36] strong and denouncing the fats so let's
[3220.92 - 3225.72] think about all this you guys I really
[3223.36 - 3227.04] love you and I really appreciate this
[3225.72 - 3229.52] this has been you know I've been a
[3227.04 - 3231.40] little bit more Punky I guess and a
[3229.52 - 3234.00] little bit more
[3231.40 - 3235.76] Sparky probably you know a little bit
[3234.00 - 3237.84] more of a pain in the butt when it comes
[3235.76 - 3239.56] down to all these things it's just that
[3237.84 - 3241.24] I'm up against a lot of the trends out
[3239.56 - 3243.16] there that are trying to always get in
[3241.24 - 3244.68] the way and keep people sick and it just
[3243.16 - 3246.08] gets you it gets you in the heart it
[3244.68 - 3247.40] gets you in the gut a little bit because
[3246.08 - 3248.96] when you see people suffer when they
[3247.40 - 3251.12] don't have to
[3248.96 - 3252.76] suffer because of something out there
[3251.12 - 3254.76] that's happening it hurts anyway drink
[3252.76 - 3256.44] your celery juice get the Liver Rescue
[3254.76 - 3258.60] find out what else you can do I love you
[3256.44 - 3260.84] guys I want you to take care bless you
[3258.60 - 3262.72] God bless you and talk to you again
[3260.84 - 3264.88] let's do the next show let's do the next
[3262.72 - 3267.32] show I'll be there with you all right
[3264.88 - 3267.32] bye he
