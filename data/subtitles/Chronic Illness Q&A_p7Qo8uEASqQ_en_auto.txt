[0.00 - 4.56] they have chronic illness they think
[1.80 - 8.04] that one or two symptoms that they're
[4.56 - 11.34] having chronically isn't an illness of
[8.04 - 14.16] any kind because maybe it did not make
[11.34 - 16.20] them bedridden maybe they're in a place
[14.16 - 18.72] where their symptoms aren't setting them
[16.20 - 20.70] back maybe they're in a place where
[18.72 - 23.10] their symptoms aren't
[20.70 - 25.02] stopping them from working and being
[23.10 - 26.76] productive maybe they're in a place
[25.02 - 29.16] where their symptoms they just push
[26.76 - 31.62] through they're not really in the way
[29.16 - 33.60] but when it gets to a point where your
[31.62 - 35.46] symptoms get worse and worse how about
[33.60 - 37.68] you like have you ever experienced this
[35.46 - 38.70] where you have the fatigue and the brain
[37.68 - 43.14] fog
[38.70 - 44.58] and the acne and the body pain and all
[43.14 - 46.38] kinds of other symptoms with it the
[44.58 - 48.72] dizziness or the vertigo or the tinnitus
[46.38 - 51.90] and then it's getting to a point where
[48.72 - 53.22] more fatigue more brain fog and you're
[51.90 - 55.74] visiting doctors and you're getting
[53.22 - 58.82] blood drawn left and right and now
[55.74 - 61.32] you're just declining and declining
[58.82 - 63.06] chronic illness right that's where
[61.32 - 65.10] people think well then maybe that's a
[63.06 - 69.24] chronic illness but no it's not just
[65.10 - 72.78] that it is any symptom that is
[69.24 - 75.30] persisting that's not going away that's
[72.78 - 76.98] just staying there day after day or
[75.30 - 78.24] intermittent where it's like it's here
[76.98 - 79.68] for a little while then a week later
[78.24 - 81.54] it's gone it's here for a little while
[79.68 - 85.14] then a week later it's gone
[81.54 - 87.06] but chronic illness is all of that
[85.14 - 89.28] good to see you guys

[139.50 - 145.44] people in the world who are chronically

[238.38 - 244.02] the right kind of tools if they only
[241.56 - 248.22] knew and that's the sad part because
[244.02 - 250.08] most people will never know no one so
[248.22 - 255.36] many people out there will never know
[250.08 - 257.94] what this is right here and what is in
[255.36 - 259.92] my hand they will never know and and
[257.94 - 261.78] that's the sad part right there it

[289.80 - 295.32] know if you read in the medical medium
[292.62 - 297.66] books about vitiligo

[331.92 - 337.74] tinnitus
[333.90 - 339.36] tinnitus right so we'll talk about
[337.74 - 341.48] tonight for a second little lie though
[339.36 - 344.52] something we can talk about too
[341.48 - 347.22] villago is a combination of the
[344.52 - 350.16] Epstein-Barr virus inside the liver
[347.22 - 352.26] okay this is important
[350.16 - 355.88] feeding off of
[352.26 - 357.78] toxic heavy metals like aluminum
[355.88 - 360.00] releasing
[357.78 - 363.66] a neurotoxin
[360.00 - 364.74] that neurotoxin damages the melon in the
[363.66 - 366.42] pigment
[364.74 - 368.70] in the skin
[366.42 - 371.60] creates
[368.70 - 371.60] vitiligo
[371.82 - 376.14] Liver Rescue
[373.74 - 377.94] cleanse the heel both these but there's
[376.14 - 379.80] Liver Rescue cleans the heel right there
[377.94 - 380.88] talk about vitiligo
[379.80 - 382.80] detail
[380.88 - 385.26] so you have to understand
[382.80 - 387.36] inside the liver
[385.26 - 390.96] lives a bug
[387.36 - 393.72] the bugs happy happy is a clam inside
[390.96 - 397.62] the liver feeding off of garbage and
[393.72 - 401.10] [ __ ] and junk and junk and garbage
[397.62 - 407.16] feeding on all that toxic crap and then
[401.10 - 409.32] it runs across a Wellspring of aluminum
[407.16 - 412.74] that Wellspring of aluminum
[409.32 - 415.26] feeds the bug the virus the virus eats
[412.74 - 419.22] it eats it eats it then it shits and
[415.26 - 423.90] pisses that toxin out and that toxin is
[419.22 - 426.66] a dermatoxin that dermatoxin is lethal
[423.90 - 428.46] to pigment
[426.66 - 429.96] and that's how you end up getting all
[428.46 - 432.06] the white spots in the middle eye going
[429.96 - 434.28] it starts going crazy Linden Forrester
[432.06 - 436.44] propolis have done at least five to
[434.28 - 439.20] seven bottles and I just keep getting it
[436.44 - 441.90] getting in a better place and the sad
[439.20 - 444.42] thing is people don't know this Linden
[441.90 - 446.22] over there on YouTube
[444.42 - 447.66] uh four times a day you're saying
[446.22 - 449.58] incredible
[447.66 - 452.10] that's amazing
[449.58 - 453.54] Pure Living on I jesus how often you
[452.10 - 456.66] take propolis
[453.54 - 458.88] do what your doctor says but I take it
[456.66 - 461.64] by three times a day
[458.88 - 463.68] I take it I don't have an illness and I
[461.64 - 464.76] take it three times a day
[463.68 - 467.16] right
[464.76 - 469.08] that's what I do do what's right for you
[467.16 - 472.92] your doctor and everything else
[469.08 - 474.96] but it's it breaks my heart saddens me
[472.92 - 478.56] when people don't know what is in my
[474.96 - 480.90] hand it's like having an answer having
[478.56 - 482.64] something that's so valuable but
[480.90 - 486.12] nobody's gonna know
[482.64 - 489.12] it's like okay it's just it's painful
[486.12 - 491.64] uh Nivea green Navy green good to see
[489.12 - 495.06] you on here on IG I give it to my kids
[491.64 - 496.86] also amazing that is so good to hear so
[495.06 - 498.60] good to hear
[496.86 - 500.52] so anyway I just want to tell you that
[498.60 - 503.28] can you please explain why Bemidji is so
[500.52 - 504.78] much better okay the four things really
[503.28 - 505.50] quick you guys just bear with me for a
[504.78 - 508.14] second we're going to talk about
[505.50 - 509.52] symptoms conditions I'm here I'm here to
[508.14 - 510.84] help I want to go through stuff with you
[509.52 - 513.42] guys
[510.84 - 515.10] four reasons why energy is better you
[513.42 - 517.32] know how you hear high quality or
[515.10 - 519.60] quality good quality
[517.32 - 521.70] and supplements are like good quality we
[519.60 - 523.20] got the quality control no there's
[521.70 - 526.20] different levels of quality there's
[523.20 - 529.26] different tiers vmrt they do something
[526.20 - 530.88] no one else does they go to the top tier
[529.26 - 532.20] where no one wants to spend their money
[530.88 - 534.06] and supplement companies don't want to
[532.20 - 536.40] spend their money they don't want that
[534.06 - 539.64] option you can get like for instance
[536.40 - 541.62] just ashwagandha you can get
[539.64 - 543.54] um okay you can get a good quality
[541.62 - 545.16] ashwagandha you can get another good
[543.54 - 546.90] quality ashwagandha you can get another
[545.16 - 548.28] good quality ashwagandha you get another
[546.90 - 550.20] good quality
[548.28 - 552.96] but they're not as good as the quality
[550.20 - 555.42] at the top and you keep on climbing up
[552.96 - 557.70] right the bottom quality is not as good
[555.42 - 560.94] as the top quality this is so important
[557.70 - 564.12] to say memory goes to The toppest
[560.94 - 566.52] quality and the tapest quality is
[564.12 - 568.26] expensive and some little companies
[566.52 - 569.58] won't do that they don't need to they'll
[568.26 - 571.74] just buy
[569.58 - 574.14] you know ashwagandha put it in their
[571.74 - 576.60] supplement and Bank on the bottom line
[574.14 - 580.62] right remember she says no we won't do
[576.60 - 582.90] that this is huge huge Bemidji goes and
[580.62 - 584.34] asks for the highest quality and if they
[582.90 - 587.40] don't have the highest quality of energy
[584.34 - 588.60] we'll go and find it somehow no one does
[587.40 - 590.28] that
[588.60 - 592.26] that's one thing let's go to another
[590.28 - 595.76] thing ready no alcohol no natural
[592.26 - 600.18] flavors no citric acid no
[595.76 - 602.94] titanium dioxide no all that junk no
[600.18 - 605.70] gluten obviously no soy but better than
[602.94 - 607.50] that they knew better at the start not
[605.70 - 610.14] to put natural flavors natural Berry
[607.50 - 612.18] flavor which is all MSG they knew not to
[610.14 - 614.58] put any of the flavors in this stuff so
[612.18 - 616.38] you know what other supplement companies
[614.58 - 618.18] will try to copy them and they'll leave
[616.38 - 621.06] out natural flavors I can actually
[618.18 - 623.94] mention one that's actually out there
[621.06 - 625.80] like yeah man ours is the best yeah dude
[623.94 - 628.02] you had natural flavors in yours and
[625.80 - 631.08] citric acid in yours forever until you
[628.02 - 633.90] copied themergy so
[631.08 - 636.90] they're the only ones though it has none
[633.90 - 638.76] of all that stuff in there none right so
[636.90 - 640.98] that's that's the next thing so let's go
[638.76 - 643.44] to the part three which is incredible
[640.98 - 646.08] into three points okay
[643.44 - 649.26] they don't put hidden stuff supplement
[646.08 - 652.08] companies are allowed to legally keep a
[649.26 - 654.12] secret from you guys they're allowed to
[652.08 - 655.44] legally put a certain percentage of
[654.12 - 657.96] hidden ingredients in your
[655.44 - 659.94] supplementation and I can guarantee you
[657.96 - 662.94] if you're doing other supplements out
[659.94 - 666.26] there you're eating hidden ingredients I
[662.94 - 669.96] can freaking guarantee that
[666.26 - 672.12] will not put that undisclosed hidden
[669.96 - 673.86] ingredient in their supplements dude you
[672.12 - 677.40] can't get that and I don't care who it
[673.86 - 679.38] is they're all putting in binders anti
[677.40 - 681.96] whatever or binding agents they're
[679.38 - 684.48] putting all kinds of stuff in there
[681.96 - 685.74] that's how insane that is that sounds
[684.48 - 691.32] insane
[685.74 - 693.42] and so these alone are reasons why and
[691.32 - 696.30] the list goes on there's so many other
[693.42 - 698.28] reasons too I could talk about it but
[696.30 - 699.30] I didn't want to make it about this I
[698.28 - 701.28] just I want to talk about symptoms
[699.30 - 703.14] conditions I want to talk about tinnitus
[701.28 - 706.74] next we'll go into that we'll go we'll
[703.14 - 708.66] dig into the book right
[706.74 - 711.24] take advantage of the sale while it's
[708.66 - 713.54] happening though okay so vimergy.com
[711.24 - 716.22] these in Victor I am as Mary
[713.54 - 717.78] ergy.com all right because people ask me
[716.22 - 720.42] about when they're having a sale over
[717.78 - 723.18] and over again how many DMs I get about
[720.42 - 727.32] that it's insane they're having a sale
[723.18 - 730.68] now but like I said even more than that
[727.32 - 732.12] it's what this is right here that I
[730.68 - 734.34] think
[732.12 - 736.20] so many people will never have an
[734.34 - 738.48] opportunity to understand or experience
[736.20 - 741.48] it or to know how it moves the needle
[738.48 - 743.72] they will never ever experience that
[741.48 - 745.88] but what is in my hand is something
[743.72 - 748.26] extremely special
[745.88 - 751.74] extremely special
[748.26 - 755.28] and I live by that propolis right there
[751.74 - 756.84] How It's Made has specific bees they use
[755.28 - 761.96] everything
[756.84 - 761.96] it is no joke no joke anyway all right
[762.90 - 765.74] let's cook
[767.04 - 774.18] let's cook with pork
[769.98 - 775.74] no and don't you pork don't do pork
[774.18 - 777.30] unless your doctor's telling you to do
[775.74 - 779.28] pork don't get don't go against your
[777.30 - 781.64] doctor's advice your doctor wants to do
[779.28 - 781.64] work
[781.74 - 788.10] um skin says skin Couture says what's
[785.10 - 790.38] the best thing for migraines so it's all
[788.10 - 792.36] about like learning about why you have a
[790.38 - 795.72] migraine so let's go in here medical
[792.36 - 799.14] medium new addition right here
[795.72 - 803.06] let's just hit migraines for a second
[799.14 - 803.06] I'm all over the place come on
[803.70 - 809.72] what is going on here
[806.10 - 809.72] let's find out where you are
[811.02 - 815.46] I'm gonna put this up here too
[813.84 - 818.10] and I'll show you what this is you guys
[815.46 - 821.34] so you even know right
[818.10 - 822.72] so that's the propolis pure so you guys
[821.34 - 824.40] can see this
[822.72 - 825.96] that's it right there because I saw it
[824.40 - 828.00] somebody actually saying like what are
[825.96 - 829.50] you even talking about

[1009.86 - 1015.98] in a quiet room until it's over
[1012.86 - 1018.98] so let's talk about it a little bit
[1015.98 - 1020.78] The Usual Suspects right here
[1018.98 - 1022.64] let's get into that
[1020.78 - 1024.26] okay there are certain conditions that
[1022.64 - 1026.60] are well known for creating migraine
[1024.26 - 1028.72] symptoms concussion
[1026.60 - 1032.42] right
[1028.72 - 1034.46] meningitis stroke
[1032.42 - 1036.92] Tia
[1034.46 - 1040.04] brain aneurysm brain tumor brain sister
[1036.92 - 1044.90] microcyst impeded cervical nerves those
[1040.04 - 1047.18] are things that medicine can find things
[1044.90 - 1051.34] that many times
[1047.18 - 1054.38] MRIs can find many times doctors
[1051.34 - 1057.08] Specialists can help patients find find
[1054.38 - 1059.06] and but if your migraines are not caused
[1057.08 - 1061.16] by those and you're just dealing with
[1059.06 - 1063.80] migraines
[1061.16 - 1065.84] then we got some other stuff going down
[1063.80 - 1067.64] this is about making you an expert of
[1065.84 - 1069.80] your own health having this incredible
[1067.64 - 1072.02] information comes from above
[1069.80 - 1075.08] if you've gone through the battery of
[1072.02 - 1077.78] tests reviewed your medical history
[1075.08 - 1080.42] with your doctors and rolled out the
[1077.78 - 1082.70] elements on the list above then you're
[1080.42 - 1084.62] in the mystery realm if you hear me
[1082.70 - 1086.78] yelling
[1084.62 - 1089.30] because some people are like I can't
[1086.78 - 1091.94] hear you speak louder
[1089.30 - 1093.56] what follows are explanations of
[1091.94 - 1095.72] migraine triggers that medical
[1093.56 - 1098.90] communities don't fully yet understand
[1095.72 - 1100.82] unless they stole it poached it taken it
[1098.90 - 1103.64] from the medical medium books
[1100.82 - 1105.04] long ago along with triggers that I'm
[1103.64 - 1107.60] disclosing Here For the First Time
[1105.04 - 1109.28] Epstein-Barr virus and shingles doctors
[1107.60 - 1111.26] don't know that millions of people
[1109.28 - 1113.30] suffer from migraines as a result from
[1111.26 - 1115.78] Epstein-Barr virus or even a shingles
[1113.30 - 1115.78] virus
[1115.88 - 1120.62] and I go into that alternatively
[1118.22 - 1122.30] shingles can inflame your trigeminal or
[1120.62 - 1126.52] phrenic nerves which go into it a little
[1122.30 - 1126.52] bit so trigeminal and phrenic nerves
[1128.24 - 1135.02] herpes simplex one the virus behind the
[1132.02 - 1138.26] common fever blister
[1135.02 - 1140.92] the virus behind the common fever
[1138.26 - 1140.92] blister
[1141.68 - 1145.10] I don't know what I'm doing I'm just
[1143.24 - 1147.98] pointing to something
[1145.10 - 1151.16] I don't know what I'm pointing to
[1147.98 - 1154.40] I don't know what I'm pointing to
[1151.16 - 1158.06] my arm just won't stop pointing stop arm
[1154.40 - 1162.82] stop stop pointing stop stop playing
[1158.06 - 1162.82] it's funny herpes simplex one
[1163.46 - 1167.06] the virus behind the common fever
[1165.26 - 1169.22] blister can also Nest within the
[1167.06 - 1172.28] trigeminal and phrenic nerves elevating
[1169.22 - 1175.84] their inflammation ever so slightly just
[1172.28 - 1175.84] enough to be a trigger
[1177.32 - 1182.00] to learn if you're being afflicted by
[1179.60 - 1183.80] the Epstein-Barr virus read these books
[1182.00 - 1185.12] this one's incredible all on its own
[1183.80 - 1186.80] okay
[1185.12 - 1190.46] here's another one for migraines that
[1186.80 - 1194.42] people don't know about micro Tia attack
[1190.46 - 1196.04] and Trigger micro tias it's a big one
[1194.42 - 1198.32] right there people have no idea they
[1196.04 - 1201.58] have let's just go into the sinus
[1198.32 - 1201.58] related migraines
[1204.80 - 1210.50] some migraines stem from chronic
[1207.16 - 1214.22] streptococcal infections that sit in the
[1210.50 - 1217.58] Linings of the sinus cavity
[1214.22 - 1223.18] strep sitting in the line line I'm sorry
[1217.58 - 1223.18] sitting in the sinus cavity linings
[1223.58 - 1230.18] craving headaches all the time for
[1226.40 - 1233.00] people chronic strep creating chronic
[1230.18 - 1235.64] headaches chronic strep creating chronic
[1233.00 - 1238.30] migraines oh it's just allergies
[1235.64 - 1238.30] allergies
[1238.48 - 1243.50] I just
[1241.58 - 1246.70] got a strep infection it never goes away
[1243.50 - 1246.70] that nobody knows about
[1246.74 - 1250.82] right there
[1248.12 - 1251.90] show this is book one there's protocols
[1250.82 - 1253.64] in here
[1251.90 - 1255.02] you can take a look at these protocols
[1253.64 - 1257.12] they're incredible so it's not just
[1255.02 - 1258.74] information there's protocols in this
[1257.12 - 1261.40] book this is medical medium new edition
[1258.74 - 1261.40] book one
[1264.56 - 1270.32] some migraines stem from streptococcal
[1267.92 - 1272.68] and these K in these cases ears nose and
[1270.32 - 1275.72] throat specialists offer often recommend
[1272.68 - 1278.12] sinus surgery to remove scar tissue
[1275.72 - 1280.34] because they don't know it but strep is
[1278.12 - 1282.02] difficult to remove they don't know
[1280.34 - 1284.06] that's why they're doing it people get
[1282.02 - 1286.22] scar tissue removed out of their sinuses
[1284.06 - 1288.44] surgeries
[1286.22 - 1290.48] out of the sinus Linings but then it
[1288.44 - 1291.62] comes back again because they had strep
[1290.48 - 1294.20] this whole time
[1291.62 - 1296.42] if these surgical procedures work at all
[1294.20 - 1298.40] then the relief they gave patients is
[1296.42 - 1300.68] only temporarily until the strep comes
[1298.40 - 1302.36] back a better way to address sinus
[1300.68 - 1305.84] related migraines is to strengthen the
[1302.36 - 1309.94] immune system so that the body can
[1305.84 - 1309.94] naturally fight infection
[1311.30 - 1316.70] um okay over there on uh Instagram my
[1314.00 - 1318.68] brain was the first thing that's gone
[1316.70 - 1320.84] after following your diet thank you so
[1318.68 - 1324.14] much God bless you
[1320.84 - 1325.88] my choice of foods good handle great
[1324.14 - 1327.62] handle
[1325.88 - 1329.54] all right so let's move it into a little
[1327.62 - 1331.22] bit of other permeability trigger that's
[1329.54 - 1333.74] really cool
[1331.22 - 1335.72] while blueberry dreams says on IG I used
[1333.74 - 1337.52] to get chronic sinus infections and was
[1335.72 - 1339.44] on antibiotics twice a year until I
[1337.52 - 1341.96] found medical medium information no
[1339.44 - 1344.54] doctors could help me now I haven't had
[1341.96 - 1347.98] one since starting medical medium it was
[1344.54 - 1347.98] the strep all along
[1348.02 - 1351.02] incredible
[1353.31 - 1358.88] [Music]
[1356.12 - 1362.44] another major migraine culprit is
[1358.88 - 1362.44] burning gut
[1362.48 - 1367.16] medical communities don't know that when
[1365.48 - 1369.62] your digestive system isn't working
[1367.16 - 1371.96] properly ammonia gas can drift out from
[1369.62 - 1374.60] your gut to your vagus and phrenic nerve
[1371.96 - 1376.40] and trigeminal nerves ammonia can cross
[1374.60 - 1378.02] the blood-brain barrier and find its way
[1376.40 - 1378.86] into all parts of the central nervous
[1378.02 - 1382.34] system
[1378.86 - 1384.62] as the gas deprives the brain of some of
[1382.34 - 1386.48] its needed oxygen tension can arise and
[1384.62 - 1388.64] you end up going into spasm and you're
[1386.48 - 1390.50] in a migraine so it's ammonia
[1388.64 - 1392.36] permeability
[1390.50 - 1393.98] medical meme information by the way and
[1392.36 - 1395.18] I see somebody stealing it out there a
[1393.98 - 1396.50] couple of people stealing the whole
[1395.18 - 1399.62] ammonia thing and now you see
[1396.50 - 1402.50] influencers like ammonia
[1399.62 - 1404.60] yeah it's like yeah yeah okay you got it
[1402.50 - 1405.74] from the medical mean books and then
[1404.60 - 1407.48] you'll see a couple of bigger
[1405.74 - 1409.28] influencers with their stuff trying to
[1407.48 - 1411.98] sell their stuff like yeah ammonia
[1409.28 - 1414.20] permeability in your liver and your HCL
[1411.98 - 1417.58] it's like dude you never spoke like that
[1414.20 - 1417.58] that's mm info
[1417.74 - 1420.82] ammonia gas
[1421.28 - 1425.00] all right let's move on there's tons of
[1423.32 - 1426.76] info here just talked about migraines
[1425.00 - 1429.92] and triggers let's see what we can do
[1426.76 - 1432.62] electrolyte deficiency trigger
[1429.92 - 1434.62] boom to remain healthy your body must
[1432.62 - 1437.24] maintain a certain level of electrolytes
[1434.62 - 1439.04] these electrolytes are used to maintain
[1437.24 - 1440.84] neurotransmitter strengthened neurons
[1439.04 - 1443.42] and send the electrical nerve impulses
[1440.84 - 1445.34] that run your body and your brain
[1443.42 - 1447.92] so here's the thing
[1445.34 - 1450.98] people are they don't have the
[1447.92 - 1452.36] electrolytes needed to sustain what
[1450.98 - 1453.26] they're up against the stress are up
[1452.36 - 1455.06] against
[1453.26 - 1455.90] lots of things in their life they're up
[1455.06 - 1459.50] against
[1455.90 - 1461.12] their current diet all of it though and
[1459.50 - 1464.72] they don't have that so that's another
[1461.12 - 1465.94] section there stress I talk about how
[1464.72 - 1468.92] that happens
[1465.94 - 1471.26] menstrual cycle trigger
[1468.92 - 1473.36] for migraines that's incredible
[1471.26 - 1475.52] information right here menstrual cycle
[1473.36 - 1477.14] triggered
[1475.52 - 1479.18] can we run into that for a little bit
[1477.14 - 1481.64] let's go
[1479.18 - 1484.46] many female migraine sufferers notice
[1481.64 - 1487.88] that their migraines come on right
[1484.46 - 1490.82] before during or after their menstrual
[1487.88 - 1493.70] cycle because when the menstrual cycle
[1490.82 - 1495.98] happens the immune system drops
[1493.70 - 1497.30] and when a woman's immune system drops
[1495.98 - 1499.40] men don't have to go through the
[1497.30 - 1500.90] menstrual cycle so their immune system
[1499.40 - 1502.64] doesn't get
[1500.90 - 1505.22] challenge
[1502.64 - 1506.72] at all it doesn't get challenged at all
[1505.22 - 1510.86] when a woman's going through
[1506.72 - 1513.86] menstruation menstrual cycle the immune
[1510.86 - 1516.14] system is focused on the reproductive
[1513.86 - 1520.40] system leaving
[1516.14 - 1523.48] all these other places alone without an
[1520.40 - 1526.76] immune system and so streptococcus
[1523.48 - 1529.10] Epstein-Barr other impedements toxic
[1526.76 - 1531.92] heavy metals whatever it is
[1529.10 - 1533.84] can easily bring on that
[1531.92 - 1536.24] that headache
[1533.84 - 1538.64] the Divine Lilith says can you also
[1536.24 - 1539.92] explain why hot weather triggers
[1538.64 - 1544.40] migraines
[1539.92 - 1547.04] expansion of nerves nerve tissues
[1544.40 - 1550.58] so hot weather
[1547.04 - 1552.86] creates swelling if you have any
[1550.58 - 1555.08] inflammation you're going to feel it
[1552.86 - 1556.76] like no other
[1555.08 - 1559.10] so you're going to see one person it's
[1556.76 - 1562.46] like I love hot weather
[1559.10 - 1565.04] I really love hot weather I could best I
[1562.46 - 1567.44] could bask in it all day long I could
[1565.04 - 1570.32] lay out in the sun I don't care how
[1567.44 - 1572.90] humid it is I can work in the garden I
[1570.32 - 1574.58] could go out and shop I can do all kinds
[1572.90 - 1576.26] of things in the hot weather you've got
[1574.58 - 1580.10] another person that's suffering in the
[1576.26 - 1583.64] hot weather they feel so sticky and
[1580.10 - 1586.70] swollen and don't feel good and they're
[1583.64 - 1588.80] swelling internally and the heat also
[1586.70 - 1591.02] puts pressure on the nerves there's a
[1588.80 - 1593.72] combination of all that the same goes
[1591.02 - 1595.46] with really really cold weather it's
[1593.72 - 1598.16] hard for somebody too who's struggling
[1595.46 - 1601.64] for a lot of reasons
[1598.16 - 1603.86] Barbara Carbone on YouTube yeah the
[1601.64 - 1606.68] propolis is good for immune system
[1603.86 - 1609.14] definitely you guys if you just got on
[1606.68 - 1612.44] here I was talking about how I wish
[1609.14 - 1614.30] people knew what this was in my hand I'm
[1612.44 - 1616.40] not insulting anybody I'm not saying
[1614.30 - 1618.86] that they don't know what propolis is or
[1616.40 - 1620.18] ever heard a propolis that's not it so
[1618.86 - 1621.86] if you're somebody and you're like well
[1620.18 - 1623.42] he's insulting me because he doesn't
[1621.86 - 1625.52] think I don't know I've never heard
[1623.42 - 1629.48] about propolis that's not it this
[1625.52 - 1632.30] product propolis pure what it is and it
[1629.48 - 1636.86] people only knew what was in my hand the
[1632.30 - 1640.16] quality the the process of how this is
[1636.86 - 1644.12] even made and how incredible it is and
[1640.16 - 1645.74] how I live by this look live by this
[1644.12 - 1648.08] propolis
[1645.74 - 1650.84] anyway Germany has a sale you guys don't
[1648.08 - 1652.94] endorse these guys
[1650.84 - 1655.16] um but I the reason why I endorse these
[1652.94 - 1657.44] guys is because stuff like this
[1655.16 - 1660.80] stuff like that
[1657.44 - 1663.56] that's why huge huge reason
[1660.80 - 1665.36] okay so let's move into some other stuff
[1663.56 - 1668.18] someone was talking about tinnitus
[1665.36 - 1672.16] tinnitus you can you can get tinnitus
[1668.18 - 1672.16] information all through these books
[1673.52 - 1679.82] and here's the thing you guys
[1676.10 - 1681.80] I don't want to see this disappear
[1679.82 - 1683.36] it would be
[1681.80 - 1685.16] a sin
[1683.36 - 1688.82] a true sin
[1685.16 - 1691.64] if this disappeared if the company
[1688.82 - 1693.14] didn't make it anymore if this wasn't
[1691.64 - 1695.60] available anymore
[1693.14 - 1697.34] it would be
[1695.60 - 1699.62] devastating
[1697.34 - 1701.90] because people
[1699.62 - 1704.12] it's an opportunity
[1701.90 - 1708.56] for good health and people don't know
[1704.12 - 1709.28] this but yeah it's just anyway so
[1708.56 - 1711.74] um
[1709.28 - 1716.06] anyway Bemidji vimergy.com these and
[1711.74 - 1719.66] Victor I am as in Mary e r g y.com
[1716.06 - 1722.74] uh their their customer services unlike
[1719.66 - 1726.62] any other and propolis
[1722.74 - 1728.92] p-r-o-p-o-l-i-s this is propolis pure
[1726.62 - 1731.30] I'm gonna hit tinnitus because I I
[1728.92 - 1733.70] bypassed it earlier
[1731.30 - 1736.42] so I'm in medical medium right here book
[1733.70 - 1736.42] one New Edition
[1736.46 - 1740.42] I'm assuming you have the books but you
[1738.80 - 1742.90] may not have the books you may not have
[1740.42 - 1742.90] this book
[1744.86 - 1749.18] no hard feelings you don't have to have
[1747.14 - 1751.22] the book so I'm just looking through
[1749.18 - 1753.56] here
[1751.22 - 1754.88] this isn't this an amazing book right
[1753.56 - 1756.98] here
[1754.88 - 1758.90] I mean you can well I have tinnitus
[1756.98 - 1761.72] inside medical medium book one I have
[1758.90 - 1764.78] tinnitus in brain saver as well
[1761.72 - 1768.16] we can we can go to either book but I'm
[1764.78 - 1768.16] looking here well
[1768.38 - 1772.94] um and I wanna I wanna read about it a
[1770.36 - 1774.68] little bit too
[1772.94 - 1776.18] let me see
[1774.68 - 1778.90] I could also read about it in brain
[1776.18 - 1778.90] saver too
[1779.02 - 1785.06] these are medical textbooks
[1782.36 - 1786.62] if you have these you know how hard this
[1785.06 - 1789.02] hard is I mean there's so much
[1786.62 - 1789.74] information it takes a second is what I
[1789.02 - 1792.38] mean
[1789.74 - 1794.30] that's not one of these thin books these
[1792.38 - 1797.00] thin paperback books these you know
[1794.30 - 1799.64] there's not much in there there's just
[1797.00 - 1801.80] some weird marketing plan in there along
[1799.64 - 1803.60] with some Diet that's trying to be
[1801.80 - 1806.06] trendy you know that's not what this
[1803.60 - 1807.86] stuff is
[1806.06 - 1809.54] Robin over there on YouTube why do
[1807.86 - 1812.68] symptoms get worse before they get
[1809.54 - 1812.68] better while healing
[1812.78 - 1818.78] so why do symptoms get worse before
[1815.90 - 1822.92] getting better while healing okay
[1818.78 - 1825.80] a lot of people it goes like this
[1822.92 - 1827.96] your healing you go three steps up two
[1825.80 - 1829.64] steps back three steps up two steps back
[1827.96 - 1831.74] three steps up and you get stronger and
[1829.64 - 1833.90] stronger and stronger right
[1831.74 - 1835.46] a lot of people
[1833.90 - 1839.66] okay
[1835.46 - 1842.36] they start taking advantage of their
[1839.66 - 1844.28] healing so they start doing more than
[1842.36 - 1845.54] they have in six months more than they
[1844.28 - 1848.42] have in a year
[1845.54 - 1849.74] and they push themselves kind of off the
[1848.42 - 1852.44] cliff
[1849.74 - 1854.60] because they're getting better and
[1852.44 - 1857.06] they're able to do more I can't tell you
[1854.60 - 1859.04] how many people are they're starting to
[1857.06 - 1860.36] heal and they want to go back to life
[1859.04 - 1863.36] the way it was
[1860.36 - 1865.52] when they weren't sick many years ago
[1863.36 - 1866.42] and they just start doing all kinds of
[1865.52 - 1869.66] stuff
[1866.42 - 1872.18] physically emotionally mentally and they
[1869.66 - 1874.46] get a setback because they went
[1872.18 - 1878.12] all of a sudden went into full speed in
[1874.46 - 1880.46] life because they were like woohoo
[1878.12 - 1882.26] I'm getting better and they got full
[1880.46 - 1884.18] speed so there's a bunch of them that
[1882.26 - 1886.06] are out there it happens
[1884.18 - 1889.52] and then there's a group of people too
[1886.06 - 1891.74] that get exposed but don't even know it
[1889.52 - 1893.90] they're working on their healing process
[1891.74 - 1895.58] they're doing good and then they get set
[1893.90 - 1897.26] back because they got exposed to
[1895.58 - 1898.58] something something somewhere don't even
[1897.26 - 1900.20] realize it
[1898.58 - 1901.52] and they're set back for a little while
[1900.20 - 1902.78] because of it maybe they're taking
[1901.52 - 1904.76] something that's tough maybe they're
[1902.78 - 1907.16] taking charcoal which is really toxic
[1904.76 - 1908.54] maybe they're taking you know sodium
[1907.16 - 1909.92] bicarbonate maybe they're doing apple
[1908.54 - 1911.90] cider vinegar maybe they're doing
[1909.92 - 1913.52] something and finally it tips the scale
[1911.90 - 1914.96] and it sends them backwards so I'm just
[1913.52 - 1917.24] giving you a few options maybe they're
[1914.96 - 1919.34] doing the alkaline ionizer water
[1917.24 - 1922.40] machines which literally is destructive
[1919.34 - 1924.56] to it just sets people back maybe
[1922.40 - 1926.48] they're doing something that's setting
[1924.56 - 1929.00] them back maybe they're doing the Rife
[1926.48 - 1930.86] machine which will set people back
[1929.00 - 1933.32] so
[1930.86 - 1936.40] um so that's the whole thing too people
[1933.32 - 1939.02] that had bad symptoms coming on already
[1936.40 - 1941.06] and by the time they started working on
[1939.02 - 1942.38] healing they was already coming on so
[1941.06 - 1944.12] there's that group of people too let's
[1942.38 - 1945.92] hit that for a second there's a bunch of
[1944.12 - 1948.26] people that we're going to get so darn
[1945.92 - 1950.00] sick it was heading there and they
[1948.26 - 1953.18] started working under healing process
[1950.00 - 1954.32] when they were already going downhill
[1953.18 - 1956.12] fast
[1954.32 - 1958.40] and as they started the healing process
[1956.12 - 1959.84] it could not catch up to it enough to
[1958.40 - 1962.36] bring it back do you guys know what I'm
[1959.84 - 1964.58] saying this is huge right here they
[1962.36 - 1967.70] couldn't get enough done with their
[1964.58 - 1970.46] healing process in enough time to stop
[1967.70 - 1973.04] the bleed and literally
[1970.46 - 1974.50] send themselves backwards to stop it
[1973.04 - 1978.20] right
[1974.50 - 1979.76] instead they were going down anyway
[1978.20 - 1983.00] it's like
[1979.76 - 1985.88] [ __ ] I'm getting sick I better try this
[1983.00 - 1988.58] I better try that I'm getting sicker
[1985.88 - 1991.10] they're just going down anyway and it's
[1988.58 - 1992.78] going to take time for them to do the
[1991.10 - 1995.24] right things to do the right protocols
[1992.78 - 1998.66] and heal and climb back up because they
[1995.24 - 2000.58] were already heading down there boom
[1998.66 - 2002.62] they're already going down
[2000.58 - 2004.90] there's that group of people
[2002.62 - 2007.14] and then there's a group of people that
[2004.90 - 2010.72] aren't doing what they need to do
[2007.14 - 2013.24] they're dabbling they're inter mixing
[2010.72 - 2014.74] things they're doing sodium bicarbonate
[2013.24 - 2016.24] tearing up their intestinal tract
[2014.74 - 2019.30] weakening their immune system while
[2016.24 - 2023.50] doing celery juice and something else
[2019.30 - 2025.36] they're doing charcoal and fish oil and
[2023.50 - 2027.58] probiotics that are probably a toxic
[2025.36 - 2031.84] variety versus
[2027.58 - 2034.60] doing enough of the other things
[2031.84 - 2036.16] right they're getting blood drawn they
[2034.60 - 2037.90] think they're working on their healing
[2036.16 - 2040.90] process and then they just had five more
[2037.90 - 2042.52] blood uh vials of drawn they're working
[2040.90 - 2044.68] under healing process and I know I
[2042.52 - 2046.36] showed you this before but I have to
[2044.68 - 2048.72] show you again because I think it's
[2046.36 - 2048.72] important
[2049.48 - 2052.26] so
[2053.14 - 2057.70] and they get five more vials four more
[2056.20 - 2059.62] vials
[2057.70 - 2061.24] 10 more vials
[2059.62 - 2063.82] they're working on their healing process
[2061.24 - 2066.34] and they just had 15 vials of blood
[2063.82 - 2069.16] drawn from a specialist and then a month
[2066.34 - 2071.50] later they tank and they're like what is
[2069.16 - 2073.54] going wrong I'm working on my healing
[2071.50 - 2076.12] process I'm doing the heavy metal detox
[2073.54 - 2078.04] I'm doing the celery juice I'm watching
[2076.12 - 2081.16] now I'm not eating the pork I'm not
[2078.04 - 2083.20] eating the you know the tuna I'm not the
[2081.16 - 2085.42] Mercury and the tuna I'm not eating the
[2083.20 - 2087.82] cheese I'm not eating the eggs
[2085.42 - 2089.62] and they go downhill because they just
[2087.82 - 2091.54] had 10 vials of blood drawn and their
[2089.62 - 2093.58] immune system was removed and their
[2091.54 - 2095.92] immune system was cleaning up the mess
[2093.58 - 2098.20] trying to keep them healthy there's that
[2095.92 - 2102.72] group of people and there's a ton of
[2098.20 - 2102.72] those people a ton of those people
[2103.72 - 2109.02] and then there's those people that get a
[2105.46 - 2109.02] bad medical treatment it just happens
[2109.60 - 2116.26] boom now it's about fighting
[2112.66 - 2118.84] to stay alive or fighting to get better
[2116.26 - 2121.24] another another group of people get food
[2118.84 - 2122.92] poisoning they should get food poisoning
[2121.24 - 2125.98] there's a whole food poisonings every
[2122.92 - 2127.60] day it's out there rampant out there
[2125.98 - 2129.82] and there's you know and that's another
[2127.60 - 2130.90] thing too they get food poisoning or
[2129.82 - 2132.94] something it triggers off their
[2130.90 - 2135.00] pathogens or they get a bad medical
[2132.94 - 2138.46] treatment or something else
[2135.00 - 2140.98] relationships uh um mental emotional
[2138.46 - 2143.62] abuse a loss and that lowers their
[2140.98 - 2145.12] immune system either way people are up
[2143.62 - 2146.98] against a lot of different things think
[2145.12 - 2149.14] about how many different triggers there
[2146.98 - 2150.94] are I'm giving you a lot of different
[2149.14 - 2153.46] scenarios but that's how many there are
[2150.94 - 2155.08] because people in their lives and what
[2153.46 - 2157.50] they're doing there's a lot of things
[2155.08 - 2157.50] going on
[2157.90 - 2163.72] so I don't know if I've given you 10
[2160.48 - 2165.94] scenarios really common or whatever five
[2163.72 - 2168.88] scenarios that are really common but
[2165.94 - 2170.92] that's what happens with people as
[2168.88 - 2174.46] they're trying to heal
[2170.92 - 2176.26] and just quick reiteration here
[2174.46 - 2179.08] there's that person who's healing but
[2176.26 - 2181.72] wants to now go back to life 100 and
[2179.08 - 2185.20] jump into something and just go full
[2181.72 - 2187.42] force and they get beaten down
[2185.20 - 2189.52] I mean there's just there's so many
[2187.42 - 2191.02] that's just one out of so many I just
[2189.52 - 2193.42] gave you and I could reiterate the rest
[2191.02 - 2195.94] of them but I think you guys got the
[2193.42 - 2198.58] point and I'm missing some too
[2195.94 - 2200.74] I'm actually missing some I know I'm
[2198.58 - 2202.78] missing a few that's how many things
[2200.74 - 2205.12] tinnitus
[2202.78 - 2209.38] said there for a little bit
[2205.12 - 2210.76] when decibel damage has been rolled out
[2209.38 - 2214.48] you haven't been to a lot of rock
[2210.76 - 2215.80] concerts you don't play the bass super
[2214.48 - 2217.30] loud
[2215.80 - 2221.14] you're not somebody that's working
[2217.30 - 2222.76] around construction and stuff like that
[2221.14 - 2224.68] and you haven't worked around heavy
[2222.76 - 2226.78] machinery for many years worked in the
[2224.68 - 2229.06] music industry around live concerts or
[2226.78 - 2230.92] had physical injury to the ear where
[2229.06 - 2234.24] something happens here here and it was a
[2230.92 - 2234.24] physical slam and hit
[2235.54 - 2239.68] right and then when you receive a
[2237.64 - 2241.42] tinnitus diagnosis because you have
[2239.68 - 2243.88] ringing or humming in the ear you're
[2241.42 - 2246.64] someone who's living with something else
[2243.88 - 2248.08] than if you weren't injured if it wasn't
[2246.64 - 2250.12] something like that when you were
[2248.08 - 2251.74] injured it was an obvious thing you were
[2250.12 - 2254.68] in the music industry you were in the
[2251.74 - 2259.42] construction industry you had a reason
[2254.68 - 2263.64] to have decibel damage in the inner ear
[2259.42 - 2263.64] and this little bones in the air right
[2263.68 - 2269.20] nerve damage and so forth if you don't
[2266.98 - 2270.28] have any of that and that's not
[2269.20 - 2273.46] happening
[2270.28 - 2275.62] you're talking about viral inflammation
[2273.46 - 2278.04] now we're talking about viral
[2275.62 - 2281.44] inflammation
[2278.04 - 2283.42] tinnitus you guys say tinnitus or do you
[2281.44 - 2286.06] say tinnitus
[2283.42 - 2288.22] tinnitus someone said tinnitus the other
[2286.06 - 2291.28] day and I was like huh what that's right
[2288.22 - 2293.14] tinnitus what tinnitus tinnitus doesn't
[2291.28 - 2295.54] have to be ringing in the ear it could
[2293.14 - 2298.36] be humming buzzing vibrating popping
[2295.54 - 2300.94] fluttering crackling is yours crackling
[2298.36 - 2303.28] is your fluttering is yours buzzing is
[2300.94 - 2306.78] yours humming is yours wishing is there
[2303.28 - 2306.78] a wishing in here whoa whooshing
[2307.68 - 2312.70] w-h-o-o-s-h-i-n-g whooshing
[2310.72 - 2313.85] when someone has the high-pitched
[2312.70 - 2316.18] ringing in the ear
[2313.85 - 2318.40] [Music]
[2316.18 - 2319.42] right the high [ __ ] see if I can get
[2318.40 - 2321.76] higher than that I don't think I can
[2319.42 - 2324.10] higher than that it can change and alter
[2321.76 - 2327.04] and dance about when a fan or an air
[2324.10 - 2330.04] conditioner is on it's like
[2327.04 - 2330.04] right
[2330.64 - 2333.30] all right
[2333.46 - 2338.08] let's see
[2335.80 - 2340.66] when someone has the high-pitched
[2338.08 - 2342.70] ringing near it's not funny if they do
[2340.66 - 2345.12] I'm just for some reason cracking myself
[2342.70 - 2345.12] up
[2346.30 - 2350.74] um can we edit that out no we can't
[2348.94 - 2352.36] because we're live
[2350.74 - 2354.58] when someone has that high-pitched
[2352.36 - 2356.20] ringing in the ear it can change alter
[2354.58 - 2358.54] and dance about what a fan or air
[2356.20 - 2360.94] conditioner is on or when music is
[2358.54 - 2363.58] playing some people experiencing the
[2360.94 - 2366.36] experience with sounds like air rushing
[2363.58 - 2366.36] through their ear
[2372.10 - 2375.84] some people experiencing popping
[2377.44 - 2382.30] like they're they're popping popcorn in
[2379.96 - 2384.64] their ear tinnitus can vary from mild to
[2382.30 - 2386.20] extreme often people get small moments
[2384.64 - 2388.66] when they hear a ringing in their ear
[2386.20 - 2390.88] and then it goes away like
[2388.66 - 2392.92] is somebody talking about me I think
[2390.88 - 2393.82] somebody honey is somebody talking about
[2392.92 - 2397.78] me
[2393.82 - 2400.36] is my friend talking about me
[2397.78 - 2402.88] right is that an angel that was speaking
[2400.36 - 2407.68] in my ear my ear rang is that a spirit
[2402.88 - 2409.90] guide like what is that ringing the ear
[2407.68 - 2412.36] this has been passed off as someone
[2409.90 - 2414.10] speaking about you or Angelic forces are
[2412.36 - 2417.22] speaking to you what most of these
[2414.10 - 2419.92] people and you'll see what most this is
[2417.22 - 2422.26] important this is why the words in the
[2419.92 - 2424.96] medical medium books are so they're
[2422.26 - 2426.64] detailed in their meaning
[2424.96 - 2429.10] they're detailed in their understanding
[2426.64 - 2433.06] this is incredible information right
[2429.10 - 2436.66] I just said this has been passed off
[2433.06 - 2440.50] as someone speaking about you when your
[2436.66 - 2442.72] ear rings or Angelic forces are speaking
[2440.50 - 2443.98] to you if you get a temporary like quick
[2442.72 - 2448.12] earring
[2443.98 - 2449.68] what most of these people why did I say
[2448.12 - 2452.08] most
[2449.68 - 2454.84] because it's possible
[2452.08 - 2458.92] that an angel
[2454.84 - 2462.82] is communicating it's possible that
[2458.92 - 2465.54] someone is talking about you it is and
[2462.82 - 2470.58] it's possible that could actually create
[2465.54 - 2470.58] some frequency to your ear
[2471.88 - 2477.04] but what most of these people who
[2473.74 - 2478.66] experience passing tinnitus discovers
[2477.04 - 2481.72] that eventually the ringing sticks
[2478.66 - 2486.40] around a little longer and a little
[2481.72 - 2491.16] longer and a little longer and a little
[2486.40 - 2491.16] longer and then permanent Boop
[2491.74 - 2496.54] and the whole time I thought someone was
[2494.80 - 2498.04] just talking about me when it was
[2496.54 - 2500.38] intermittent
[2498.04 - 2502.36] and the whole time I thought it was an
[2500.38 - 2504.64] angel trying to communicate because it
[2502.36 - 2506.62] was intermittent once in a blue moon I
[2504.64 - 2510.76] got a little ringing in the air but now
[2506.62 - 2514.68] five years later hot damn I got tinnitus
[2510.76 - 2514.68] it's ringing all the time
[2515.08 - 2519.76] they get to a point where they're past
[2517.30 - 2522.16] the whole phase of it must be a ghost or
[2519.76 - 2524.26] a spirit or an angel or someone talking
[2522.16 - 2527.40] about me and they realize they're
[2524.26 - 2527.40] developing a condition
[2528.16 - 2532.18] sometimes it takes years of intermittent
[2530.20 - 2534.22] ringing in the ears to be diagnosed with
[2532.18 - 2536.38] tinnitus many times hearing loss can
[2534.22 - 2539.44] occur with tinnitus because the ringing
[2536.38 - 2541.90] is so dominant in many situations even
[2539.44 - 2545.14] if the ringing isn't dominating hearing
[2541.90 - 2546.46] can also be lost I've seen bar is the
[2545.14 - 2548.50] number one reason why people have
[2546.46 - 2550.24] mystery tinnitus I talk about how it
[2548.50 - 2552.84] occurs yes I'm just trying to cut
[2550.24 - 2552.84] through some of this
[2553.30 - 2555.84] yep
[2556.06 - 2560.80] Lorraine now says mine is like a random
[2558.04 - 2561.88] movement in my left ear but has improved
[2560.80 - 2565.96] lately
[2561.88 - 2567.94] good good if your body's healing
[2565.96 - 2570.52] and you're doing things to heal your
[2567.94 - 2574.00] body they're really powerful
[2570.52 - 2576.70] other things are in the works of healing
[2574.00 - 2578.44] and sometimes some symptoms are left
[2576.70 - 2580.12] high and dry for a while
[2578.44 - 2583.06] important critical piece of information
[2580.12 - 2584.62] for anybody who's got chronic illness
[2583.06 - 2586.48] here
[2584.62 - 2588.40] anybody you know who has chronic illness
[2586.48 - 2590.68] Dr fine good to see you
[2588.40 - 2594.30] MD
[2590.68 - 2594.30] this is critical to know
[2594.82 - 2601.00] when your body's healing your immune
[2597.52 - 2603.90] system is taking care of business
[2601.00 - 2606.78] if it's given the tools it needs
[2603.90 - 2610.96] especially it's taking care of business
[2606.78 - 2613.30] if it's given tools it needs especially
[2610.96 - 2614.98] it's taking care of business right
[2613.30 - 2616.24] and when your immune system is taking
[2614.98 - 2618.28] care of business
[2616.24 - 2621.96] it's working on things you may not even
[2618.28 - 2621.96] know exist inside your body that are
[2622.24 - 2627.82] symptom or it's working on two or three
[2624.88 - 2631.00] symptoms and problems and sometimes some
[2627.82 - 2635.08] symptoms are going to be left alone for
[2631.00 - 2638.44] a while and high and dry or your immune
[2635.08 - 2640.90] system is fixing the problem fixing the
[2638.44 - 2644.20] ear ringing issue but the nerve has been
[2640.90 - 2647.50] injured by the Epstein-Barr virus and so
[2644.20 - 2650.44] now the Epstein-Barr virus is gone
[2647.50 - 2652.78] out of the ear
[2650.44 - 2655.36] because your immune system gobbled it up
[2652.78 - 2658.30] and your protocols killed it off
[2655.36 - 2661.42] but then you still got some tinnitus
[2658.30 - 2663.88] left over because the nerve channel has
[2661.42 - 2666.22] to heal the Damage Done to the nerve
[2663.88 - 2668.32] channel the inflammation that damaged
[2666.22 - 2670.78] the nerve channel from the virus has to
[2668.32 - 2674.44] heal so now it could take a long time
[2670.78 - 2676.90] for the body to repair repair the damage
[2674.44 - 2678.70] and what if you don't know the medical
[2676.90 - 2680.62] medium information good enough and you
[2678.70 - 2683.56] don't know other tools to use within it
[2680.62 - 2685.12] to repair damaged nerves so that's
[2683.56 - 2688.06] another reason why it takes longer for
[2685.12 - 2691.96] some people to heal because there's it's
[2688.06 - 2694.68] in here the secret sauce is in here in
[2691.96 - 2694.68] these books
[2696.46 - 2699.06] so yeah
[2699.88 - 2703.24] all right
[2701.26 - 2706.06] keep on rolling
[2703.24 - 2709.18] we're rolling
[2706.06 - 2712.00] okay anyway the protocol for tinnitus is
[2709.18 - 2713.38] inside brain saver protocol so I just
[2712.00 - 2716.86] want to get to that to the moment there
[2713.38 - 2719.14] it is what's that brainstorm circles
[2716.86 - 2722.10] juggling some books around right now
[2719.14 - 2722.10] there it is
[2722.62 - 2729.94] so
[2724.84 - 2732.10] I got a surprise coming up for you guys
[2729.94 - 2734.14] not going to say anything right now
[2732.10 - 2737.92] because I just have to make sure it's
[2734.14 - 2739.48] actually happening but I got a surprise
[2737.92 - 2741.58] that's gonna be cool
[2739.48 - 2743.56] it's gonna be something fun we could all
[2741.58 - 2744.94] do together
[2743.56 - 2748.36] that is
[2744.94 - 2750.28] incredibly life changing
[2748.36 - 2753.46] some of you are familiar with it already
[2750.28 - 2756.82] and may have partaken in it in the
[2753.46 - 2759.46] medical medium book series but I want to
[2756.82 - 2761.38] do this with you guys
[2759.46 - 2763.72] and so I'm gonna be making an
[2761.38 - 2764.86] announcement coming up I'm hoping I'm
[2763.72 - 2766.54] hope
[2764.86 - 2768.04] I'm hope I just got my team working hard
[2766.54 - 2769.30] on it
[2768.04 - 2772.36] I got
[2769.30 - 2774.94] things in the works but I can't wait to
[2772.36 - 2777.30] announce it I'm hoping because it's
[2774.94 - 2780.58] gonna be so powerful
[2777.30 - 2783.28] life-changing emotionally
[2780.58 - 2785.86] spiritually life-changing and it's
[2783.28 - 2787.54] coming up stay tuned stay tuned to the
[2785.86 - 2791.32] medical meme newsletter you don't want
[2787.54 - 2794.08] to miss this you don't want to miss this
[2791.32 - 2796.74] seriously
[2794.08 - 2796.74] today
[2797.86 - 2802.26] we were working on it trying to make it
[2800.08 - 2802.26] happen
[2802.54 - 2807.28] in some so I want to talk about this for
[2804.40 - 2810.76] a second in some instances there is die
[2807.28 - 2813.16] off from pathogens that people feel
[2810.76 - 2814.84] you need to have a decent High viral
[2813.16 - 2816.94] load
[2814.84 - 2819.52] right and I see a lot of people out
[2816.94 - 2821.32] there that have
[2819.52 - 2822.76] um they don't really know what's
[2821.32 - 2826.30] happening they don't know they're really
[2822.76 - 2829.06] having a die off they don't know
[2826.30 - 2831.88] what's going on so that's something two
[2829.06 - 2834.64] I saw a question pop up about die off
[2831.88 - 2836.80] if someone is extremely
[2834.64 - 2838.06] viral
[2836.80 - 2840.04] right
[2838.06 - 2842.14] and people overuse the word detox so
[2840.04 - 2844.00] we're back on detox a little bit
[2842.14 - 2845.80] because I've been working on this detox
[2844.00 - 2847.30] podcast episode that eventually want to
[2845.80 - 2849.58] get out to you guys I'm just I'm not
[2847.30 - 2851.26] done with it but
[2849.58 - 2853.12] and you're gonna need some patience for
[2851.26 - 2856.18] that one because that one ain't no one
[2853.12 - 2859.60] hour podcast episode that one is gonna
[2856.18 - 2861.22] be like a three hour I don't know like
[2859.60 - 2863.92] it's insane
[2861.22 - 2866.80] so because anyway but the word detox is
[2863.92 - 2868.78] so abused and so misused
[2866.80 - 2871.06] and I told you the last time we did
[2868.78 - 2872.50] write this get-together right here in
[2871.06 - 2874.78] the Q a
[2872.50 - 2876.58] it's so misused
[2874.78 - 2878.62] because people don't know why people are
[2876.58 - 2881.14] sick and they don't know what's going on
[2878.62 - 2883.36] inside their body so it's the perfect
[2881.14 - 2885.64] out for a lot of people too oh you're
[2883.36 - 2887.92] detoxing oh you're getting much sicker
[2885.64 - 2890.86] and sicker sicker oh you're detoxing
[2887.92 - 2892.42] right and so and then the whole detox
[2890.86 - 2894.22] pathway thing oh you just don't know
[2892.42 - 2895.84] about the detox Pathways that you don't
[2894.22 - 2898.54] know about the detox Pathways either
[2895.84 - 2902.44] like you'll hear that out there
[2898.54 - 2904.66] but people have to understand that
[2902.44 - 2907.78] it all depends
[2904.66 - 2910.90] like you won't you'll rarely ever hear
[2907.78 - 2913.48] me use the word detox because I use the
[2910.90 - 2915.88] word cleansing because what you're
[2913.48 - 2918.40] really doing is you're cleansing out
[2915.88 - 2920.92] those impurities
[2918.40 - 2922.78] and you're doing it in a way that you
[2920.92 - 2924.88] can feel the least amount of symptoms if
[2922.78 - 2926.86] it's done properly and correctly and
[2924.88 - 2929.08] medical medium information does that
[2926.86 - 2931.30] because it's not man-made
[2929.08 - 2935.10] it's not like someone's saying take this
[2931.30 - 2937.90] take this I Got Dirt in here and I got
[2935.10 - 2940.90] geophobic in here and I got and I got
[2937.90 - 2943.30] probiotics in here and I got you know I
[2940.90 - 2945.82] got bentonite clay in here I got clay in
[2943.30 - 2948.34] here and I even threw a little bit of
[2945.82 - 2950.68] Ayahuasca in here for emotional detox go
[2948.34 - 2952.72] ahead and take that down oh you're sick
[2950.68 - 2956.14] oh you're detoxing that's why we're sick
[2952.72 - 2958.78] from drinking that you're detoxing
[2956.14 - 2962.08] there's so much stupidity out there
[2958.78 - 2965.86] it's it's incredible so the whole point
[2962.08 - 2967.72] is is that is detox is thrown around as
[2965.86 - 2970.60] if it's just like this answer to
[2967.72 - 2973.36] everything no one understands and that's
[2970.60 - 2975.76] the sad part about detox but if you're
[2973.36 - 2977.68] really toxic in the sense where you're
[2975.76 - 2980.68] high viral load
[2977.68 - 2983.52] you're loaded with poisons and toxins in
[2980.68 - 2987.76] a sluggish stagnant liver
[2983.52 - 2989.02] if you do like protocols right cleansing
[2987.76 - 2991.54] right
[2989.02 - 2993.94] you might get some lethargy
[2991.54 - 2995.68] and I talk about that symptoms in the
[2993.94 - 2998.86] medical medium books
[2995.68 - 3001.32] but you're not going to get so sick and
[2998.86 - 3004.20] develop all of a sudden some crazy rash
[3001.32 - 3006.66] or some other thing that's
[3004.20 - 3008.70] because you were getting sick you were
[3006.66 - 3010.98] actually getting sick people don't
[3008.70 - 3013.44] realize they got a lot going on inside
[3010.98 - 3015.30] of them they're already heading to a
[3013.44 - 3016.98] place where they're getting sick they're
[3015.30 - 3020.88] already been sick
[3016.98 - 3023.16] and it's ketchup time and it's hard to
[3020.88 - 3025.32] catch up with a lot of people fast
[3023.16 - 3027.18] instant and overnight
[3025.32 - 3029.88] so that's a whole nother point that I
[3027.18 - 3031.74] didn't mention the other day
[3029.88 - 3032.58] here's something you never want to
[3031.74 - 3035.58] forget
[3032.58 - 3038.58] and I've seen this information used
[3035.58 - 3041.40] and it's not correct
[3038.58 - 3044.28] right is
[3041.40 - 3047.70] the medical medium cleanses are hard on
[3044.28 - 3051.42] the adrenals they're not hard on the
[3047.70 - 3053.40] adrenals that's misinformation what is
[3051.42 - 3056.04] hard on the adrenals
[3053.40 - 3058.38] is water fasting
[3056.04 - 3060.00] I'm not against and I talked about this
[3058.38 - 3063.12] short term
[3060.00 - 3065.82] short-term water fast if necessary
[3063.12 - 3068.46] for crises I've talked about that in the
[3065.82 - 3071.82] medical mean books but water fasting
[3068.46 - 3075.30] hard on these renals
[3071.82 - 3077.94] straight juice fasting only hard on the
[3075.30 - 3081.96] adrenals
[3077.94 - 3084.60] not getting enough calories
[3081.96 - 3086.28] okay is hard on the adrenals that's why
[3084.60 - 3087.90] medical medium information has the
[3086.28 - 3092.64] adrenal stacks
[3087.90 - 3095.34] that's why eating regularly
[3092.64 - 3098.16] is critical to sustain the adrenals
[3095.34 - 3101.60] that's why medical medium cleanses don't
[3098.16 - 3101.60] take away food
[3102.42 - 3106.70] because you take away food completely
[3104.76 - 3109.86] from somebody
[3106.70 - 3113.10] especially for so many reasons and boom
[3109.86 - 3116.58] that's hard on the adrenals
[3113.10 - 3118.86] so medical medium cleanses are designed
[3116.58 - 3121.44] from above
[3118.86 - 3124.02] to protect the adrenals that's the whole
[3121.44 - 3126.60] point to protect
[3124.02 - 3129.42] the adrenals
[3126.60 - 3131.00] and it's critical to know that
[3129.42 - 3133.70] chocolate
[3131.00 - 3137.88] destroys adrenals
[3133.70 - 3140.78] cacao hurts the adrenals caffeine hurts
[3137.88 - 3140.78] the adrenals
[3140.94 - 3145.56] Ayahuasca destroys and annihilates the
[3144.06 - 3147.30] adrenals
[3145.56 - 3150.12] I'm just saying these are some things
[3147.30 - 3153.30] right there okay
[3150.12 - 3156.54] high doses of apple cider vinegar hurt
[3153.30 - 3159.36] the adrenals by burning out the stomach
[3156.54 - 3162.18] glands and into and and in turn killing
[3159.36 - 3164.94] off your HCL which makes your adrenals
[3162.18 - 3167.94] work harder like there's so many things
[3164.94 - 3171.36] that injure adrenals Every Day High high
[3167.94 - 3174.08] fat diets every single day hurt the
[3171.36 - 3174.08] adrenals
[3174.86 - 3181.56] betrayal hurts the adrenals
[3177.92 - 3184.32] emotional losses hurt the adrenals being
[3181.56 - 3186.42] stabbed in the back hurts the adrenals
[3184.32 - 3189.00] being emotionally triggered hurts the
[3186.42 - 3190.74] adrenals
[3189.00 - 3192.48] so
[3190.74 - 3196.74] these are all important things to
[3192.48 - 3199.26] understand MSG hurts the adrenals
[3196.74 - 3201.54] MSG
[3199.26 - 3203.64] hurt so these are all important things
[3201.54 - 3207.06] to know because what you'll see out
[3203.64 - 3208.44] there you'll say oh 369 cleanse it's too
[3207.06 - 3210.00] much on my it's too much in your
[3208.44 - 3213.00] adrenals it's designed to protect your
[3210.00 - 3214.92] adrenals restore that
[3213.00 - 3215.82] so when I hear this this is a little
[3214.92 - 3219.02] tough
[3215.82 - 3219.02] a little tough
[3220.56 - 3227.72] the monocleanse restores someone's
[3223.86 - 3231.18] damaged and burnt outage renals the 369
[3227.72 - 3234.00] protects and restores adrenals it's a
[3231.18 - 3236.22] big part of how someone recovers the
[3234.00 - 3240.12] heavy metal detox cleanses helps restore
[3236.22 - 3242.22] adrenals they're adrenal Savers adrenal
[3240.12 - 3245.16] restorers
[3242.22 - 3247.14] bring your backers
[3245.16 - 3250.08] but somebody might feel high and happy
[3247.14 - 3252.90] for a bit when they start tanking fats
[3250.08 - 3256.50] again where was where was this my whole
[3252.90 - 3259.02] life I was on the 369 for two months and
[3256.50 - 3261.72] I was just feeling lethargic
[3259.02 - 3264.72] what you're doing is you were healing
[3261.72 - 3267.72] deep deep deep inner core stuff your
[3264.72 - 3270.54] body was in the healing mode you're on
[3267.72 - 3272.76] the 369 if you do it correctly your body
[3270.54 - 3275.22] was in the healing mode
[3272.76 - 3277.56] chipping away at all those things that
[3275.22 - 3280.14] are freaking wrong inside the body and
[3277.56 - 3282.48] you're you're in the healing mode and
[3280.14 - 3285.00] then when you shut off that cleansing
[3282.48 - 3287.10] healing mode you were cleansing and
[3285.00 - 3289.94] healing and when you shut that cleansing
[3287.10 - 3292.56] and healing mode down that's a new move
[3289.94 - 3294.00] when you shut in that cleanse and
[3292.56 - 3296.10] healing mode down
[3294.00 - 3299.64] what happens is
[3296.10 - 3303.42] you get high high as a kite you're
[3299.64 - 3306.96] flying oh my God I had a slice of pizza
[3303.42 - 3309.96] I'm bringing in two avocados a day I
[3306.96 - 3312.90] just had some beans I just had beans and
[3309.96 - 3315.00] avocado I just had some oil I just had
[3312.90 - 3318.18] and what happened was you're hot
[3315.00 - 3320.64] freaking high as a kite buying Hezekiah
[3318.18 - 3324.26] because your adrenals were restored so
[3320.64 - 3329.22] much they were restored they're so
[3324.26 - 3331.44] jamming strong that when you dumped fat
[3329.22 - 3334.98] into your bloodstream
[3331.44 - 3338.82] or cacao into your bloodstream your
[3334.98 - 3341.22] adrenals were loaded and were like boom
[3338.82 - 3344.88] and you were like oh my God I'm euphoric
[3341.22 - 3349.50] I'm high you know screw that diet what
[3344.88 - 3352.26] the 369 was hard what meanwhile the 369
[3349.50 - 3355.50] restored those adrenals it did deep
[3352.26 - 3357.30] cleansing and deep healing
[3355.50 - 3359.70] and then
[3357.30 - 3361.98] you threw in all the fat
[3359.70 - 3363.90] and you threw in the cacao and your
[3361.98 - 3366.30] adrenals just freaking released a ton of
[3363.90 - 3368.16] adrenaline because the whole time you
[3366.30 - 3370.08] were burnt out all these years and
[3368.16 - 3372.06] you're doing the 369 and you're doing
[3370.08 - 3374.16] the cleanses in the 2018 cleanse because
[3372.06 - 3376.62] you're so freaking burnt out that your
[3374.16 - 3379.02] adrenals were fried
[3376.62 - 3381.24] and they restored and they restored
[3379.02 - 3383.04] Weeks Later months later they restored
[3381.24 - 3385.14] six months later they restored they
[3383.04 - 3388.56] finally restored and so when you went
[3385.14 - 3390.66] off the wagon and jumped into that slice
[3388.56 - 3393.30] of pizza that vegan pizza and those
[3390.66 - 3395.34] avocados heavy avocados and that tahini
[3393.30 - 3397.14] on your salad and those bean burritos
[3395.34 - 3399.54] and when you went into that you were
[3397.14 - 3401.46] high as a kite and you were feeling the
[3399.54 - 3405.26] effects of what you did for yourself
[3401.46 - 3405.26] healing and restoring yourself
[3407.40 - 3410.66] I'd be able to do that forever
[3410.82 - 3414.36] you might be somebody that needs more
[3412.32 - 3418.14] healing and you can only do it so long
[3414.36 - 3422.34] before father time or father Christmas
[3418.14 - 3424.02] says Ah you were really sick years ago
[3422.34 - 3426.06] and you better get back on your
[3424.02 - 3428.60] protocols and your and your you know
[3426.06 - 3433.64] cleanses and you better get going
[3428.60 - 3433.64] because yeah you still got more to go
[3441.30 - 3445.46] can't tell you how many I see do that
[3446.52 - 3451.02] and they even hide
[3448.80 - 3452.70] what's going down because they don't
[3451.02 - 3454.74] want to be embarrassed so they can't be
[3452.70 - 3456.96] honest about stuff I'm not saying that
[3454.74 - 3458.28] no judgment it's just I've seen a lot of
[3456.96 - 3461.16] different stuff out there
[3458.28 - 3463.44] nerves need time to restore and heal
[3461.16 - 3465.72] central nervous systems need time to
[3463.44 - 3468.66] restore and heal
[3465.72 - 3473.66] adrenals need time to restore and heal
[3468.66 - 3473.66] but no way and nowhere
[3474.90 - 3479.40] our medical medium cleanse is actually
[3477.00 - 3481.14] there to harm an adrenal it's there to
[3479.40 - 3483.24] restore them and make them Rock Solid
[3481.14 - 3484.38] and I've witnessed it myself throughout
[3483.24 - 3487.44] the decades
[3484.38 - 3489.54] for a lot of people that literally were
[3487.44 - 3492.30] on steroids
[3489.54 - 3495.18] because they had no adrenals left and
[3492.30 - 3496.68] they had to do the 369 day in and day
[3495.18 - 3498.06] out and restore their adrenals until
[3496.68 - 3501.06] their doctor was like you don't even
[3498.06 - 3503.58] need injections anymore and boom
[3501.06 - 3505.56] so it's the opposite when people are
[3503.58 - 3507.90] immobile and lose a lot of their
[3505.56 - 3510.42] Mobility it can be harder to come back
[3507.90 - 3513.42] because they can't get
[3510.42 - 3518.30] they can't get you know where they need
[3513.42 - 3518.30] to be fast takes time
[3520.68 - 3525.48] when someone is bedridden or stuck in a
[3523.74 - 3527.46] wheelchair they can lose a lot of
[3525.48 - 3529.74] mobility and muscle and connected tissue
[3527.46 - 3533.58] and have a lot of problems
[3529.74 - 3535.26] from not being able to move much
[3533.58 - 3537.54] and that's something that happens to a
[3535.26 - 3540.18] lot of people so it takes time to heal
[3537.54 - 3542.94] and cleanse and rebuild nerves and get
[3540.18 - 3545.46] them strong enough to to rehab physical
[3542.94 - 3546.84] therapy and very sick people and when
[3545.46 - 3548.52] you do the medical medium stuff because
[3546.84 - 3550.92] medical medium stuff is for the really
[3548.52 - 3554.60] sick people so they can rehab and
[3550.92 - 3554.60] restore it takes time
[3559.20 - 3562.92] well anyway
[3566.16 - 3571.44] I'm speechless
[3568.80 - 3574.68] speechless
[3571.44 - 3577.50] so Susan says mystery throat tightening
[3574.68 - 3580.20] neurological symptoms let's head into
[3577.50 - 3582.30] here and see if there's anything in
[3580.20 - 3586.52] brand saver
[3582.30 - 3586.52] protocols let's try to find it here
[3586.86 - 3590.54] curious very curious
[3593.40 - 3598.02] look
[3595.62 - 3599.58] a lot of times I you guys I I try to
[3598.02 - 3602.16] keep up with everything and I try to
[3599.58 - 3604.32] keep up with everything the best I can
[3602.16 - 3605.88] but there's so much going on
[3604.32 - 3608.52] you know to try to bring the information
[3605.88 - 3610.32] to you guys and and put these books
[3608.52 - 3614.36] together with Spirit of compassion's
[3610.32 - 3614.36] information of one human being
[3614.88 - 3617.96] trying my best
[3619.86 - 3623.60] seriously
[3621.60 - 3623.60] um
[3625.56 - 3630.50] and um all right so let's get into it
[3628.20 - 3630.50] right now
[3631.62 - 3634.20] and I'll apologize for flipping through
[3633.42 - 3637.10] me
[3634.20 - 3637.10] Pages here
[3637.50 - 3646.04] this is one chapter right there
[3640.98 - 3646.04] you guys have to read supplement gospel
[3646.68 - 3650.64] so I'm going to look into neurological
[3648.90 - 3652.98] symptoms like chest heightening throat
[3650.64 - 3655.94] tightening throat tightening okay we're
[3652.98 - 3655.94] going to go into that a little bit
[3655.98 - 3658.80] but
[3657.60 - 3660.78] um
[3658.80 - 3662.28] it there's another thing that pains me
[3660.78 - 3664.56] out there when someone says you don't
[3662.28 - 3667.16] need supplements
[3664.56 - 3667.16] dude
[3668.70 - 3672.72] there are people out there walking right
[3670.86 - 3676.26] now and living their life because of
[3672.72 - 3678.24] supplementation added to their protocols
[3676.26 - 3680.16] without it
[3678.24 - 3682.86] baby screwed
[3680.16 - 3685.02] totally screwed
[3682.86 - 3687.66] there are people that if they didn't
[3685.02 - 3691.62] have the right tools
[3687.66 - 3694.92] they'd be riddled in pustules in their
[3691.62 - 3700.08] mouth their throat their vaginal area
[3694.92 - 3704.00] like if it wasn't for supplementation
[3700.08 - 3704.00] if it wasn't for supplementation
[3704.34 - 3707.06] forget it
[3707.28 - 3711.72] I don't
[3708.92 - 3713.40] appreciate blatant
[3711.72 - 3716.28] ignorance
[3713.40 - 3718.62] on the matter out there
[3716.28 - 3721.88] just because someone or somebody out
[3718.62 - 3721.88] there doesn't personally like me
[3722.76 - 3726.42] they don't like
[3724.02 - 3728.46] my tude or
[3726.42 - 3729.54] me as a person or they heard rumors and
[3728.46 - 3730.80] stories that aren't even real and
[3729.54 - 3733.82] they've convinced themselves they are
[3730.80 - 3733.82] whatever it is
[3735.66 - 3741.60] there are supplementation that freaking
[3738.54 - 3743.16] turn people's lives and it's critical
[3741.60 - 3745.32] so
[3743.16 - 3747.14] it
[3745.32 - 3750.36] biased personal
[3747.14 - 3753.42] vendettas or whatever and influencers
[3750.36 - 3755.10] all through social media or wherever I
[3753.42 - 3757.20] don't like medical medium whatever it
[3755.10 - 3758.82] has whatever it is
[3757.20 - 3762.00] that don't
[3758.82 - 3764.16] actually say that it's not all
[3762.00 - 3766.14] supplements that are bad
[3764.16 - 3768.36] there's so many that have all this red
[3766.14 - 3769.80] dye and all this garbage and gluten and
[3768.36 - 3771.48] soy and everything else and that's just
[3769.80 - 3773.64] some and there's some that just have all
[3771.48 - 3775.26] the gelatin and all that garbage in it
[3773.64 - 3777.30] whatever then there's some that are just
[3775.26 - 3778.92] that don't have that in there but are
[3777.30 - 3780.48] just straight out bad like bentonite
[3778.92 - 3783.42] clay and charcoal and all that other
[3780.48 - 3785.70] stuff but no one's no one's kind of like
[3783.42 - 3788.40] breaking that down so people can learn
[3785.70 - 3790.02] these are all supplements are bad you
[3788.40 - 3792.54] don't need it you just need food really
[3790.02 - 3793.62] you just need food because yeah there
[3792.54 - 3795.84] are people out there that just need
[3793.62 - 3797.10] celery juice and their acid reflux is
[3795.84 - 3798.84] gone forever
[3797.10 - 3800.64] but then that's that person there's that
[3798.84 - 3802.32] Mom that's bedridden that has kids and
[3800.64 - 3804.72] they they and the kids are like Mommy
[3802.32 - 3807.24] why are you in bed for eight hours a day
[3804.72 - 3810.48] and there's those moms that if they
[3807.24 - 3813.80] didn't have the right tools they'd still
[3810.48 - 3813.80] be bedridden God forbid
[3814.98 - 3820.38] so
[3816.12 - 3822.78] the whole kind of like misunderstanding
[3820.38 - 3824.76] the attack on supplementation is
[3822.78 - 3826.98] completely the confusing process of that
[3824.76 - 3829.58] is just unbelievable
[3826.98 - 3829.58] so

[3946.14 - 3951.24] these vagus nerve symptoms that result
[3948.84 - 3954.98] from an inflamed brain stem could
[3951.24 - 3954.98] include tightness of the chest
[3955.56 - 3958.94] tightness of the throat
[3959.28 - 3961.86] I feel bad for anybody going through any
[3961.02 - 3965.34] of this
[3961.86 - 3967.68] just kills me mild dizziness and
[3965.34 - 3970.32] imbalanced feeling a sense of not
[3967.68 - 3972.90] digesting well anxiety pressure in the
[3970.32 - 3976.92] chest difficulty swallowing
[3972.90 - 3980.28] even if mild a hard time taking a deep
[3976.92 - 3983.36] breath pain in the throat nausea and
[3980.28 - 3987.90] sometimes erratic heartbeat
[3983.36 - 3991.16] all with inflammation of the vagus nerve
[3987.90 - 3991.16] grape vine
[3991.68 - 3996.66] when vagus nerve inflammation is
[3993.84 - 4000.40] stemming from higher up like this from
[3996.66 - 4000.40] the brain stem itself
[4002.18 - 4007.01] from the brain stem itself
[4003.84 - 4007.01] [Music]
[4011.90 - 4017.42] maybe I didn't have to take you apart
[4014.18 - 4020.66] from the brain stem itself
[4017.42 - 4024.26] it could be a little bit of everything
[4020.66 - 4026.72] if the inflammation is in the brain stem
[4024.26 - 4028.16] itself it could be a little a little bit
[4026.72 - 4030.20] of everything difficulty swallowing
[4028.16 - 4032.42] digestive problems anxiety pressure in
[4030.20 - 4034.22] the chest imbalance feeling mild
[4032.42 - 4037.12] dizziness tightness of the throat
[4034.22 - 4037.12] tightness of the chest
[4040.64 - 4045.26] I shouldn't have taken that much celery
[4043.16 - 4049.16] for us before coming on
[4045.26 - 4051.32] I just threw an extra bunch in
[4049.16 - 4053.12] who's counting
[4051.32 - 4054.98] when vagus nerve inflammation is
[4053.12 - 4056.78] stemming from higher up like that it can
[4054.98 - 4060.14] do that
[4056.78 - 4062.72] as inflammation Ebbs and flows in the
[4060.14 - 4064.28] brain stem from mild to more severe some
[4062.72 - 4065.90] of the inflammation will lessen are
[4064.28 - 4068.72] intensified on the Vegas they're a great
[4065.90 - 4070.22] fine inflammation can come and go based
[4068.72 - 4073.28] on whether someone was getting more
[4070.22 - 4075.52] sleep or lacking sleep
[4073.28 - 4080.18] because when you sleep
[4075.52 - 4082.48] your vagus nerve calms down it calms
[4080.18 - 4082.48] down
[4085.46 - 4089.84] just so much Vegas Urban I'll do a Vegas
[4088.04 - 4092.18] nerve show
[4089.84 - 4095.30] or a podcast or whatever eventually but
[4092.18 - 4097.94] yeah so back to that question
[4095.30 - 4101.96] someone's dealing with tightness of the
[4097.94 - 4104.50] throat tightness of the chest
[4101.96 - 4104.50] yep
[4105.44 - 4111.68] information that's critical you guys
[4108.50 - 4113.96] oh wait we got another question here IG
[4111.68 - 4116.84] how to stay a little positive and
[4113.96 - 4120.14] motivated to keep healing after breaking
[4116.84 - 4122.06] some rolls in bad conditions that you're
[4120.14 - 4125.38] bringing some rules
[4122.06 - 4128.90] you mean breaking protocol
[4125.38 - 4130.16] breaking cleanse
[4128.90 - 4132.50] um
[4130.16 - 4136.04] first of all critical to know no
[4132.50 - 4137.54] judgment ever ever
[4136.04 - 4139.94] no judgment
[4137.54 - 4141.20] okay life is hard
[4139.94 - 4144.44] life
[4141.20 - 4147.74] is hard if it
[4144.44 - 4150.50] if someone doesn't believe life is hard
[4147.74 - 4151.94] they're either totally bullshitting
[4150.50 - 4154.78] themselves
[4151.94 - 4154.78] or
[4155.96 - 4165.04] more money than God they have
[4160.82 - 4165.04] with very little stress if any
[4166.64 - 4171.98] either or life is hard there's a lot of
[4169.64 - 4174.32] Temptations around us there's peer
[4171.98 - 4176.50] pressure there's hard times we're up
[4174.32 - 4176.50] against
[4176.60 - 4180.46] a lot of people go through a lot
[4181.34 - 4186.98] and that's that's on all accounts
[4184.76 - 4189.20] for anyone and everyone
[4186.98 - 4190.76] I've seen spiritual gurus throughout the
[4189.20 - 4193.58] decades
[4190.76 - 4195.68] that anyone would think they have it all
[4193.58 - 4199.22] down and nothing could ever harm them or
[4195.68 - 4202.52] happen to them meanwhile
[4199.22 - 4205.70] the crap they go through as they keep it
[4202.52 - 4208.88] quiet is unbelievable there's
[4205.70 - 4210.38] life isn't easy
[4208.88 - 4213.74] but that's okay
[4210.38 - 4216.52] we Forge ahead we stay strong and fight
[4213.74 - 4218.96] for it the key the key is to be
[4216.52 - 4220.22] compassionate and realistic about what
[4218.96 - 4223.22] happened
[4220.22 - 4225.02] don't be upset don't get upset if you
[4223.22 - 4226.76] get a little set back from it get right
[4225.02 - 4229.34] back on track when you get a chance but
[4226.76 - 4232.72] the keys to be compassionate
[4229.34 - 4232.72] and easy on yourself
[4235.04 - 4237.58] look
[4238.52 - 4244.10] let me get right back on it
[4241.16 - 4247.16] look I I look I'm guilty of a lot of
[4244.10 - 4249.86] things one of the things I'm guilty of
[4247.16 - 4253.34] is if I'm working too hard on something
[4249.86 - 4258.10] for too many hours I won't
[4253.34 - 4258.10] get something I need to eat
[4258.20 - 4266.18] so that's kind of like a mistake that I
[4260.84 - 4269.06] make even with SOC in my ear saying you
[4266.18 - 4271.28] just passed another two hours without
[4269.06 - 4272.96] getting some glucose in your bloodstream
[4271.28 - 4275.96] for your brain because you're thinking
[4272.96 - 4278.84] like intensely you're you're working on
[4275.96 - 4280.94] a project and you're so involved in that
[4278.84 - 4282.50] project you just literally it's four or
[4280.94 - 4284.90] five hours later you didn't get any
[4282.50 - 4286.88] glucose in you you had a little bit of
[4284.90 - 4288.44] coconut water you had some celery juice
[4286.88 - 4291.50] but you don't have anything else in you
[4288.44 - 4294.50] you better do it and I'm guilty of doing
[4291.50 - 4296.84] things like that but then I I tried to
[4294.50 - 4298.52] say okay okay okay I'm not trying to be
[4296.84 - 4301.52] hard on my adrenals I'm not trying to be
[4298.52 - 4304.10] hard on my brain I know my brain needs
[4301.52 - 4306.74] glucose I will do better tomorrow I will
[4304.10 - 4309.26] do better tomorrow
[4306.74 - 4311.56] comes and I screw up again and I do it
[4309.26 - 4311.56] over again
[4312.26 - 4315.46] the medical media
[4316.46 - 4321.86] Anthony William aw a dubs he does it
[4320.06 - 4324.98] again the next day because five six
[4321.86 - 4327.50] hours I'm working so hard I don't go and
[4324.98 - 4329.84] get myself a piece of fruit I don't do
[4327.50 - 4331.46] any of that and then it's like SOC
[4329.84 - 4333.44] saying it all over again and so the
[4331.46 - 4338.12] third day it's like finally I'm back on
[4333.44 - 4340.04] track or something but yeah so
[4338.12 - 4343.04] whatever protocol is what I'm saying you
[4340.04 - 4344.84] do or however you're doing it or
[4343.04 - 4346.16] whatever cleanse you're working on or
[4344.84 - 4347.66] whatever Foods you brought in
[4346.16 - 4349.10] incorporating is it just the wild
[4347.66 - 4350.84] blueberries you brought in it's wild
[4349.10 - 4352.64] blueberries and celery juice whatever it
[4350.84 - 4356.00] is you did and you fall off the wagon
[4352.64 - 4359.18] it's okay get back on discipline is
[4356.00 - 4362.18] important and it comes it comes
[4359.18 - 4363.92] and it goes It goes
[4362.18 - 4365.78] and then it comes it calms that
[4363.92 - 4368.54] discipline and then it goes It goes then
[4365.78 - 4371.24] it comes it goes and comes and it stays
[4368.54 - 4373.82] there and stays there and stays there
[4371.24 - 4374.90] and stays there and stays there and it
[4373.82 - 4377.18] goes
[4374.90 - 4379.58] but
