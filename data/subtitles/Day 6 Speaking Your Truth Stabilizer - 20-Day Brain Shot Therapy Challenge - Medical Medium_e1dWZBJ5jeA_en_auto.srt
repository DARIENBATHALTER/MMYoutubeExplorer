how much I'm gaslit

131
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,960
the amount of gaslighting that happens

132
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,600
to me is insanity I mean they're just

133
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,580
influencers are gaslighting the crap out

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,040

light the flame although they like the

137
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,520
match Erica Malik yes or that person

138
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,560

139
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,259
exactly

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,540
you're feeling stifled

141
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,840
you're not being heard

142
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:19,500
you aren't being taken seriously think

143
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,180
about that easling says me me and me

144
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,979
story of your life I saw somebody say

145
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,380
Story of My Life

146
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,900
Michelle L says I'm never being heard

147
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,500
Erica says every damn day

148
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,940

149
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,800
saw that too

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,900
so what I love about the speaking your

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
truth stabilizer it does something it

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,660
rewires the brain it helps to unblock in

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,500
each individual person it's

154
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,120
it does something different for everyone

155
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,520
because everybody has a different

156
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,820
version of what's Happening inside their

157
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,820
brain

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,960

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,940

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,120
that's a big one how about this one

163
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,360
you're afraid to speak up about

164
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,060
something you're afraid to speak up

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,280

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,080

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000

169
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,639

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,639

173
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
everywhere just comes out of their mouth

174
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,300
they're just like spewing and then

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
you've got all these good-hearted souls

176
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,539
and good-hearted individuals and pure

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,860
souls and good people and they're afraid

178
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,900

181
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,180

foreign

383
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,620
about Hidden Truths for example when

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:05,339
you're seeking out Hidden Truths

385
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:09,720

a truth Seeker when you want to read

387
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,279
between the lines

388
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
you want to see the truth and read

389
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,660
between the lines or you're a truth

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,180
Seeker

391
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,279
you want to expand your horizon your

392
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,720
understanding of the truth about what's

393
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
happening in the world you want to

394
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,899
expand you don't want to be locked in a

395
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,480
box you don't want when some truth does

396
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,339
fall in your hands you can't see it

397
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,720
because you're just you're stuck and

398
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,760
you've got the brainwashing and

399
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,680
conditioning if you want to break

400
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,339
conditioning speaking your truth

401
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,339
stabilizer

402
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,079
when Spirit of compassion gave me this

403
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,940
one right here this brain shot therapy

404
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,000
right here at a brain saver when Spirit

405
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,480
of compassion offered this

406
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,420
from above I was like what

407
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,820
what do you mean

408
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,279
I was taking down the notes feverishly

409
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,260
on this one Speaking of Truth stabilizer

410
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,420
what are you talking about I was writing

411
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,160
down the notes like this and spirit of

412
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,100
compassion was it's for conditioning

413
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,660
it's for brainwashing it's about

414
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,519
unlocking that emotional center it's

415
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,600
about if someone told you the truth you

416
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,100
wouldn't even see it if you could

417
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,800
because you're all locked up in here

418
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,480
it's about opening that Gateway that

419
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,699
door to hearing the truth do you hear

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,680
how incredible this is my mind was

421
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,839
completely blown when I was writing down

422
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,699
these notes for this one right here

423
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,440
it's when you want to read between the

424
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,600
lines you want to build that telepathic

425
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,220
power you want to build that Clairvoyant

426
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,560
skill you want to build that intuitive

427
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,180
nature inside of you you want to be able

428
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,800
to read between the lines you want to

429
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,440
know about Hidden Truths you want to

430
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,480
seek the truth all of that and when I

431
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,540
heard that I was like this is probably

432
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,120
one of the most profound brain shot

433
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,720
therapies that are in the brain saver

434
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,720
books

435
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,519
it can also help build a skin

436
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,880
build a skin

437
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,579
right

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,660
so you're not afraid you're not afraid

439
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,660
to hear a truth

440
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,559
a truth that can better your life a

441
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,480
truth that can move you forward a truth

442
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,040
that can break conditioning move that

443
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,819
out of the way the truth that can

444
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,700
literally unlock and start

445
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,820
breaking down that brainwashing that

446
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,860
this world has done to so many people so

447
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,600
the world is this big because they've

448
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,580
been brainwashed

449
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,440
foreign

450
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,179
I want to read I want to read a little

451
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,220
bit in brain saver if you guys got a

452
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,320
minute

453
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,940
I'm going to go to page 12 of brain

454
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,580
saver you guys wanna

455
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,760
this is kind of a little bit

456
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,440
different but it's interesting I thought

457
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,940
it would be just kind of really cool to

458
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,799
read

459
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,799
senso said this is so mind-blowing

460
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,920
another thing too is they're weaponizing

461
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,280
the truth

462
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,400
[Music]

463
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,620
you the term truth they're weaponizing

464
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,840
it right you see that out there they're

465
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,000
weaponizing my truth

466
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,740
somebody might have an experience but

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,960
it's not technically the truth it's an

468
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,700
experience they had an opinion but what

469
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,320
they're doing is they'll use that and

470
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,720
they'll just weaponize it that's my

471
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,400
truth right

472
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,400
that's a new technique

473
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:41,940
this actually helps to clean that up

474
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,100
so that somebody's observation

475
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,140
because here's what happens

476
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,140
a car can be coming around the bend

477
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,940
and run over somebody but one person

478
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,820
doesn't even see it

479
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,440
and another person does the person that

480
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,820
didn't see that car run over the person

481
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,740
is going to say I didn't see that car

482
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,740
run over the person that was my truth

483
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,980
the other person saw that car

484
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,380
run that person over and that person

485
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,980
said no

486
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,280
the truth is the car ran over the person

487
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,799
the other person saying I didn't see it

488
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,400
so my truth is that car didn't run over

489
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,400
that person

490
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,940
the truth stabilizer helps us so we can

491
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
see things more so we can understand

492
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,179
them more

493
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,960
we can understand if we've been hurt

494
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,960
emotionally

495
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,780
you might have been hurt emotionally

496
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,820
and not even know it

497
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,120
because we're conditioned

498
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,860
not to talk about it not to

499
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,360
feel it

500
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,919
and you

501
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,720
you shift something in the brain of

502
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,740
rewiring an insults you know what I was

503
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,100
hurt

504
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,780
the truth comes out I was hurt

505
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,460
somebody else with an observation be

506
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,660
like you weren't hurt you weren't hurt

507
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,240
at all

508
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:13,520
my truth says you weren't hurt and the

509
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,520
person's like no I actually was hurt

510
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,100
somebody asked what book this is

511

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,320
your sensory input isn't the only

560
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,780
information your neurons decipher and

561
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,480
pass along

562
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,179
you smell

563
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,020
you taste

564
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,020
you hear

565
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,620
that information comes in and goes

566
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,200
through interior neurons right you smell

567
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,780
something boom your cranial nerves are

568
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,900
taking it in you hear something right

569
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,640
you're you're taking it in you taste

570
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,500
something you're taking it in your

571
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,539
sensory input isn't the only information

572
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,000
your neurons decipher and pass along

573
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:45,179
they also translate information about

574
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,340
your body processes neurons apply to

575
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,360
every single function your body has so

576
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,320
I'm talking about this for a minute

577
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,720
because we're going to talk about what

578
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,500
happens when neurons get all clogged up

579
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,860
with toxins and then all of a sudden

580
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,900
everything gets skewed in here

581
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,940
and you might know somebody that's like

582
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,980
wait a minute

583
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,419
that person's got some serious toxins

584
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,059
inside the neurons this is really

585
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,700
incredible information right here

586
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,500
neurons apply to every single function

587
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,600
your body has

588
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,520
so your brain your neurons apply to

589
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,559
every function and how healthy your

590
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,260
neurons are determines how comfortable

591
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,919
you're going to be in your mind and body

592
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,840
if you see somebody losing their mind

593
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,780
like their manic

594
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,340
they're running down the street naked

595
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,559
but they're not running down the street

596
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,120
naked because they made a decision to do

597
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,240
a prank

598
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,700
where they stripped off their clothes

599
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,220
they jumped out of their car and they're

600
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,740
running down the highway because they

601
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,539
wanted to

602
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,159
which I still think is probably

603
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,080
something's going on there but if they

604
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,059
but if they're but if it's somebody

605
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,220
that's running down the street naked

606
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,220
right

607
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,539
so your neurons determine how

608
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,280
comfortable you're going to be in your

609
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,679
mind and body that is neurons are

610
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,080
involved in both mental functioning and

611
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,240
your state of health mental functioning

612
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,700
your neurons are involved in that when

613
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,860
you have brain related symptoms even on

614
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,600
the milder scale such as a mild fatigue

615
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,100
or mild brain fog It's really because

616
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,740
neurons can't transfer information

617
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,080
properly to the next group of neurons if

618
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,460
anybody has fatigue now we're in the

619
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,780
whole speaking or true thing but there's

620
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,640
something in here that's interesting

621
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,320
about this if you're dealing with

622
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,140
fatigue if you're somebody with some

623
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,900
type of fatigue and that fatigue is more

624
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,179
than exhaustion

625
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,340
that fatigue is more than exhaustion

626
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,580
that means the neurons have something

627
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,320
going on something wrong with them now

628
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,299
of course we talk about what that is in

629
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,299
the books but

630
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,980
it's transferring information

631
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,539
to the next group of neurons and if

632
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,700
there's if there's something hindering

633
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,860
this pathway in the electricity with the

634
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,039
traveling of that information then you

635
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,960
get fatigue you get it you get you get a

636
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,419
problem you get a symptom

637
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,120
something is blocking or otherwise

638
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,520
impeding the pathway within the synapsis

639
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,440
so the neurons sending out electrical

640
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,820
impulses are not reaching other neurons

641
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,500
that need the information or not

642
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,120
reaching the neurons as intended so what

643
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,559
I'm getting to right now if you have a

644
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,840
physical symptom something's wrong

645
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,120
neurons in the brain with information

646
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,700
are trying to send that information to

647
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,380
areas in your body if your fatigued

648
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,120
something's going on with the central

649
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,740
nervous system your neurons okay

650
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,299
you can see this in everyday life when

651
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,640
you're telling someone a story about

652
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,080
apples and find out that the whole time

653
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,720
they thought you were talking about

654
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,900
oranges did you ever have that situation

655
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,940
you're talking about apples and someone

656
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,940
thinks you're talking about oranges

657
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,220
any kind of impedement within a person's

658
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,740
neurons can mean that the information

659
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,020
their neurons process gets altered

660
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,880
affecting that person's ability to focus

661
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,799
listener properly properly receive

662
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,840
information from a conversation or story

663
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,820
what I'm trying to say is

664
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,559
if something's going on in somebody's

665
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,919
neurons

666
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:14,100
and you're telling them a story

667
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,659
this is what happened to me

668
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,080
right

669
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:22,740
I was walking along the sidewalk I

670
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:27,080
tripped on a crack in the sidewalk

671
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,080
I fell I banged my head

672
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,340
and got up and then somebody on a

673
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,620
bicycle hit me

674
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:38,039
going by

675
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,740
I went to the emergency room I thought I

676
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,539
had a concussion

677
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,000
and they're telling somebody this and

678
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:48,960
this is what the person heard

679
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,159
they were skipping along on the sidewalk

680
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,740
and

681
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,500
hit a guy on a bike and the guy in the

682
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,360
bike went to the hospital

683
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,360
that's the story they heard

684
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,020
you're talking about apples somebody

685
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,260
else is talking about oranges

686
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,260
foreign

687
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,340
is that when you're you're talking about

688
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,480
a story that happened to you you're

689
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,799
talking about experience that happened

690
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,779
to you and you're telling the story to

691
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,179
somebody else and they're not getting it

692
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:23,460
they're like what happened to you what

693
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,500
you tripped you fell where what what guy

694
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,720
was on a bicycle is that guy okay you're

695
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,940
like no I'm the one that got hurt I

696
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,880
banged my head the guy hit me on the

697
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,140
bicycle I went to the emergency room and

698
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,940
you know you're trying to tell them the

699
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,620
story but but they're not really getting

700
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,480
it all so you have to tell the story

701
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,980
over again I don't know if you've ever

702
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
run into that have you ever had that

703
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,220
situation you're trying to tell that

704
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,440
story again

705
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,159
and you you're trying to get them to

706
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,159
understand you

707
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,799
so that person may tell somebody else an

708
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,539
entirely different version and so you

709
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,460
tell somebody your story and that person

710
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,679
tells somebody else a story that's not

711
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,720
the same story

712
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,400
because they're hearing it differently

713
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,820
from you

714
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,159
so you're telling the story to someone

715
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,020
a story that may have meaning to you an

716
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,940
experience that you had and the person

717
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,880
you just told that story to is now

718
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,400
telling a story to someone else

719
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,840
but it's not coming out the same

720
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,840
it's coming out differently

721
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,760
and it wasn't correct

722
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,900
then that person may tell someone else

723
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,659
with an entirely different version of

724
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,659
the original story that was told to them

725
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:42,600
this is how gossip and rumors can be

726
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,460
twisted and turned into hearsay as the

727
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,279
story goes from person to person it goes

728
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,380
through each person's contaminated

729
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,960
impeded blocked or diminished neurons

730
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,559
and the story changes

731
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,559
this is how a story can go from person

732
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:00,659
to person to person and the way the

733
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,380
story started out is not the way the

734
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,380
story ended

735
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,940
so the original story somebody spoke of

736
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,159
went through

737
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,120
all these brains

738
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,020
so the story you just had about your

739
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,140
life

740
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:22,320
went into somebody else's brain

741
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,200
and when it came out of their mouth

742
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,640
to someone else it went into that other

743
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,720
person's brain

744
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,820
and then it went from their brain out to

745
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,380
somebody else and went into somebody

746
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,380
else's brain

747
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,380
the story's changing each each time as

748
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,320
it's going along the story is not the

749
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,480
same the story isn't the original story

750
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,039
from where it started

751
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,039
it has altered

752
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,880
it's not the same story

753
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,940
it reminds me of a person I know that

754
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,679
worked on a cruise ship

755
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,700
something happened to them on that

756
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,760
cruise ship

757
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,620
they told somebody that was also working

758
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,320
on that cruise ship

759
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,059
it went to that person and then that

760
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,260
person told another person that was on

761
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,779
that cruise ship

762
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,720
and by the time it got around to all the

763
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:21,720
people who worked on the cruise ship

764
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,840
it got back to the original person and

765
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,820
it was an entirely different story

766
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,159
and there's a reason for this

767
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,100
because people have brain problems

768
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,120
because people have neurons that are

769
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,799
toxic

770
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,899
have all kinds of different short

771
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,240
circuiting going on in their brain

772
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:41,640
all kinds of different blocks in their

773
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,620
emotional centers of the brain all kinds

774
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,200
of different injuries in their brain

775
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,659
they look fine they seem fine but this

776
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,460
story changes as it goes along

777
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,740
so it goes into this next part this is

778
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,419
interesting though we're in brain saver

779
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,039
right here if you guys gotta admit it'd

780
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,020
love to read a little bit more as

781
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,600
electricity travels through an impeded

782
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,279
neuron system and this is this is really

783
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,919
incredible in for info when you think

784
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,220
about it it can become diminished so as

785
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,679
electricity travels through

786
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,720
people's neurons and people's neurons

787
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,720
are dirty

788
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,179
they get their toxic neurons

789
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,279
it diminishes meaning that electricity

790
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,919
within the brain is no longer traveling

791
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,140
at its full capacity

792
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,179
that is a group of neurons can receive a

793
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,279
fully charged electrical impulse and and

794
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,260
then in the process of assimilating and

795
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,059
registering that electricity which is

796
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,159
filled with information

797
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,080
and sending it through the synapsis to

798
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,419
another group of neurons electricity can

799
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,399
be diminished when electricity is

800
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,320
diminished the information within it can

801
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,539
be skewed changed and altered so what

802
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,980
happens is when you're someone's hearing

803
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,559
something

804
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,760
when they're hearing something

805
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,799
okay

806
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,779
what yeah

807
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,279
what happened to that person

808
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,799
all right

809
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,539
all right you got it okay I'm gonna tell

810
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,120
somebody else what

811
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:05,159
they fell into the water

812
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,779
somebody had to pull them out and save

813
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,080
them all right

814
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:13,020
yeah this person fell off a cliff

815
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,299
yeah fell off a cliff

816
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,159
yep I someone I don't know someone

817
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,440
helped him

818
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,419
really person fell off a cliff and

819
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,700
somebody helped them all right let me go

820
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:26,520
let me go tell somebody that

821
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,520
hey this person was hanging off a cliff

822
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:33,059
they were rock climbing I think and some

823
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,520
helicopter had to come and get them

824
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,899
oh really the helicopter had to come and

825
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,020
get them they were hanging off the cliff

826
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:42,659
okay let me tell somebody else about

827
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,880
this this is unbelievable yeah that the

828
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,520
Coast Guard had to come and help

829
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,440
somebody that was like they fell off the

830
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,299
cliff and they were they were at the

831
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,100
rocks at the bottom of the cliff and the

832
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,100
Coast Guard had to come yeah exactly

833
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,940
and that's how it works

834
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:05,100
Health list says the fact that we can

835
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,840
have contamination is such Advanced

836
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,520
information you won't find that in

837
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,320
neuroscience

838
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,360
I'll tell you what you find in

839
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,940
neuroscience

840
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,760
five top foods that are really helpful

841
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,980
for the brain one is Cacao chocolate

842
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,840
science is actually saying chocolate's

843
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,539
getting better for the brain Than People

844
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,220
another one is mushrooms you know the

845
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:29,240
kind of mushrooms

846
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,039
that's another one too psychedelics

847
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,980
another one is something that helps your

848
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:38,580
tear telomeres you're telomeres we're

849
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,279
finding that genes are are a big role in

850
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,899
our brains

851
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,480
another food source for your brains is

852
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:47,580
apple cider vinegar everybody should be

853
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,120
on a shot of that a day

854
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,559
and number five

855
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,899
some red wine

856
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,820
because red wine is the greatest of all

857
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,820
I bought a Vineyard a matter of fact

858
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:04,799
Melanie Belling says I am a teacher for

859
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,040
communication and that makes many

860
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,200
communication problems so clear

861
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,619
I am at your service I'm trying my best

862
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,200
to message the information from above so

863
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,760
that teachers like you can teach

864
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,099
incredible and I'm sure you're an

865
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,540
amazing teacher Beverly Harvey says how

866
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:24,780
can you tell the difference between

867
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,820
someone who is an evil soul and someone

868
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,980
who acts badly because of toxins and

869
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,080
metals in their brain oh my God that's

870
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,300
an incredible question and I'm going to

871
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,700
screen sheet that question because I

872
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,780
want to do a podcast episode on that

873
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,460
question

874
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,500
and then have Spirit of compassion

875
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,500
answer it because that's going to be fun

876
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,619
okay okay okay I lost my spot

877
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,619
I lost my spot sorry about all this

878
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,859
all right electricity can carry

879
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,359
tremendous amount tremendous amounts of

880
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:59,700
information

881
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,680
electricity you guys that's your

882
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,240
thoughts electricity in your brain

883
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,280
carries a thought

884
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,680
it travels

885
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,520
through your brain that electricity

886
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,380
electrical impulse has information in it

887
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,720
so the electricity running through the

888
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,780
brain is more than just a hot wire it's

889
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,300
not just life-giving vitalization hot

890
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,119
wires keeping us alive electrical

891
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,400
currents no it's not just that it's

892
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,560
information that's in the electricity

893
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,839
itself and then information has to

894
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,280
travel from neuron to neuron so that

895
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,660
information goes from one part of the

896
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,119
brain to another part of the brain and

897
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,040
if you got toxins in there that's when

898
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,960
that information go to one part of the

899
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,200
brain goes the other part of brain gets

900
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,240
skewed up you're talking too fast now

901
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,880
electricity traveling through your brain

902
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,560
can even carry information you won't or

903
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,599
don't use

904
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,520
that's interesting right there

905
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,260
electricity traveling through your brain

906
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,640
can carry information you're not even

907
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,980
going to use

908
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,680
it's there it's there for the taking

909
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,300
with the electricity and we let it slip

910
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,940
by because we're focused on another

911
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,400
piece of information I'm focused on this

912
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,099
candy bar I want to eat

913
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,020
but in that same piece of information I

914
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:16,260
I see a candy bar

915
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,180
I'm at Whole Foods I don't want that

916
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,619
candy bar right there it's it's a

917
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,240
healthy one it says it's healthy it

918
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,380
doesn't have any added sugar or anything

919
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,500
like that

920
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,780
I want to grab that candy bar

921
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,920
but in that same moment you're you're

922
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,119
thinking that that Pete that wire that

923
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,700
hot wire

924
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,140
that let's glimpulse has something else

925
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,839
in there

926
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,020
something else is in there you ready

927
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,240
what's in there is that candy bar I

928
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,640
don't think is good for me

929
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,800
because I heard somewhere maybe even

930
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,440
from the medical medium

931
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,420
the chocolate is actually really toxic

932
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,119
but nobody knows that

933
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,420
but yet they're not accessing that piece

934
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,880
of information they're only accessing

935
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,980
I really want that candy bar and that's

936
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,119
the only part they access within that

937
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,119
information on that neuron

938
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,780
we're trying to tell someone something

939
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,280
that we're getting from that electricity

940
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,200
and at the same time leaving out

941
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,540
information that's within that

942
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,160
electricity as well I'm only going to

943
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,380
tell you the parts of the story that I

944
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,619
want to tell you I'm kind of leaving the

945
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,619
rest

946
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,980
I'm going to tell you what happened the

947
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,099
pickup truck

948
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,140
rolled into town

949
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,240
and the tire blew out of that pickup

950
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,220
truck

951
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,280
but I'm gonna leave out the rest of that

952
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,020
information you know the truck ran over

953
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,420
some nails

954
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,740
it's so strange how our brains work it's

955
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,240
insane

956
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,920
we're trying to tell someone something

957
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,720
that we're getting from that electricity

958
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,760
at the same time leaving out information

959
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,560
that's within that same electricity as

960
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,060
well we may feel there was something

961
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,380
more to say oh my God here's what

962
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,599
happens if you ever have something on

963
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,520
the tip of your tongue

964
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,540
we call it on the tip of your tongue

965
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,240
right it's on the tip of my tongue

966
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,220
what the heck was it gotta tell you

967
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,320
something I gotta tell you something

968
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,599
yeah yeah no no I already told you that

969
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,660
no no I already told you that

970
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,560
I told you about that this is something

971
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:25,619
else what is it what is it

972
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,720
what am I thinking right now

973
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,740
do you ever have something on the tip of

974
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,940
your tongue right

975
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,320
it's on the top of my head somewhere

976
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,220
it's in the tip of my tongue somewhere

977
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,280
it's somewhere what was it

978
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,440
we may feel there was something more to

979
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,020
say yet we don't know what it really was

980
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,960
because it has already passed us by the

981
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,820
reason why we actually don't know what

982
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,500
it is in that moment it's on the tip of

983
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,440
our tongue it's because it passed by

984
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,240
already in that electricity through that

985
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,660
neuron and we didn't grab it as it was

986
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,060
passing by we did not access what that

987
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,940
was it was on the tip of my tongue man

988
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,400
and I didn't access it is what happened

989
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,700
we did not grab it out of that

990
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,859
electrical grid that it was passing

991
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,200
through that neuron it passed it was

992
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,099
there you knew it was there you know it

993
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,240
was there

994
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,240
what was it

995
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,920
were you going to say something else

996
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:38,099
your partner or companion or friend says

997
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,780
and we may reply yeah I was so busy with

998
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,079
other thoughts I can't remember what it

999
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,599
was we're not having a memory lapse I

1000
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,240
just don't have a good memory I can't

1001
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,940
remember what it was I was saying what

1002
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,160
the hell was I thinking or saying I was

1003
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,380
saying something I know where it was it

1004
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,300
was on the tip of my tongue my memory

1005
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,880
must be going I'm losing my memories

1006
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,040
what was happening

1007
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,240
you weren't losing your memory you

1008
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,240
didn't have the memory laughs

1009
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,339
it's like medical medium said this

1010
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,320
that's not what medical medium said

1011
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,400
do you guys see that out there wait I

1012
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,140
want to ask you guys this do you guys

1013
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,020
see this out there

1014
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,660
medical medium said this

1015
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,599
but medical medium didn't say that right

1016
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,640
it happens too

1017
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,940
I did everything medical medium and

1018
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,280
didn't work it did not work for me

1019
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,140
you didn't do everything medical medium

1020
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
I did everything medical medium it

1021
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,339
didn't work

1022
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,040
I mean if I only was a fly on the wall

1023
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,839
the I would see with people who

1024
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,880
have said that that evolved that like

1025
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,359
there's people on there that are paid to

1026
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,579
say that all over Instagram they're paid

1027
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,220
to go on there and say that and they

1028
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,900
don't even do anything medical medium

1029
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,700
and if I was to fly on the wall for the

1030
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,500
people that do do some medical medium

1031
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,300
stuff a little bit of stuff and they say

1032
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,400
I tried everything medical medium I did

1033
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,020
that it didn't work and here flying the

1034
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,820
wall and you see what they eat and you

1035
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,440
see what they do I'm not judging them

1036
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,000
but if you see what they eat and what

1037
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,000
they do

1038
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,200
uh they had everything happen they've

1039
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,300
went and gone they've also gone

1040
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,520
we've also done this they've also done

1041
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,800
that

1042
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,440
they've eaten this

1043
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,480
they've gone here they've gone there

1044
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,020
I've tried everything medical medium and

1045
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,020
it didn't work

1046
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,780
you know

1047
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,900
okay I just want to read a little bit of

1048
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,900
this

1049
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:48,240
it's crazy some of the stuff

1050
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,400
you didn't have the memory lapse that

1051
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,359
was what I was talking about okay you

1052
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,660
just

1053
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,700
did not access or couldn't access that

1054
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,480
information that was passing by and

1055
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,480
there might be a reason

1056
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,440
those same people that say I tried ever

1057
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,300
here's what's crazy here's a funny thing

1058
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,619
right here okay I know I go off topic

1059
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,780
sometimes I can't help it it's not

1060
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,160
really off topic it's on topic you ready

1061
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,619
there's some people out there that'll

1062
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,640
say I tried medical medium and it didn't

1063
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,400
work

1064
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,680
those are the same people I find out put

1065
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,280
lemon juice in their celery juice

1066
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,359
those are but they think

1067
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,359
they did it right

1068
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:32,099
or those are people that like put water

1069
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,839
in their celery juice or

1070
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,960
we're only drinking four ounces of

1071
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,099
celery juice a day a cup of celery juice

1072
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,200
a day

1073
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,820
eight ounces or something you know what

1074
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,300
I mean and they say I tried all medical

1075
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,300
medium

1076
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,280
brain neuron problems

1077
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,660
you know can also make it like that a

1078
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,220
lot of people they're sick they don't

1079
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,300
have look a lot of people are struggling

1080
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
and this is

1081
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,740
this is why like when people

1082
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,079
say things

1083
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,319
like that and it's not really accurate

1084
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,540
to what's happening I never freak out I

1085
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,880
just feel bad I feel bad because I know

1086
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,579
the person if they're not a paid troll I

1087
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,920
know the person actually thinks they are

1088
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:16,500
doing everything medical medium so I'm

1089
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,819
not judging them I mean yeah fly in the

1090
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,640
wall sure and you'll see what they're

1091
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,040
doing and it's like oh dear lord what

1092
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,319
like what do they you know what I mean

1093
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,240
you see that right and it's like oh no

1094
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,440
they're not doing medical medium and

1095
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,579
then or all of a sudden they'll do a

1096
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,079
post out there or something and you'll

1097
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,380
see you'll see it that way too and

1098
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,380
you're like

1099
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,480
so what happens is that but they think

1100
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,819
they are they think they did they think

1101
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,220
they did the medical medium stuff

1102
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:47,099
they like got rid of like

1103
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,380
dairy products for like a month and

1104
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,960
they're like I did medical medium

1105
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,880
but their brain neuron problem kind of

1106
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,500
like falls into it whether they then

1107
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,119
they convince themselves I did medical

1108
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,119
medium and then they go on social media

1109
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,859
like no I did medical medium

1110
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,859
yep I did not mean it didn't work for me

1111
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:06,599
don't do it it's bad it doesn't work

1112
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,800
because they weren't underst they

1113
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,500
weren't able to even understand the

1114
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,359
information I mean honestly

1115
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,119
I'm gonna tell you this right because

1116
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:18,540
I'm not a rocket scientist

1117
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,780
I'm not an educated medical doctor

1118
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:25,619
I'm not a um whatever

1119
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,839
this is this is a lot of information

1120
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,060
so I can't judge people if they can't

1121
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,140
really like uneven understand what

1122
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,339
they're reading there's people out there

1123
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,520
that said they read the book and I'm

1124
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,260
like what

1125
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,339
and they're eating an egg sandwich

1126
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,020
see

1127
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,640
no no I read the book and they're eating

1128
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,500
an egg sandwich I said you know that you

1129
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,960
know I talk about why you shouldn't eat

1130
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,280
eggs in in the books like you did what

1131
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,460
do you mean I didn't even I missed that

1132
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,460
part

1133
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,900
okay damaged neurons can change thoughts

1134
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,380
altering how someone perceives

1135
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,380
information

1136
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,460
damaged neurons

1137
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:05,640
can

1138
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,339
change thoughts so that someone's

1139
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,500
perception of what they're hearing is

1140
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:12,540
like right

1141
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,280
that's because damaged neurons mean

1142
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,859
altered disorganized and poorly

1143
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,880
reorganized electricity so here's what

1144
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:22,880
I'm saying it's electricity that's all

1145
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,980
kind of like

1146
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,339
all distorted it's electricity

1147
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:32,099
that's disorganized then reorganized

1148
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:33,960
then altered

1149
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:36,420
as that electricity travels through

1150
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,460
synapsis and heads to another group of

1151
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,619
neurons

1152
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,420
information in that electricity could

1153
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,780
become disorganized before it enters a

1154
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:48,380
new group of neurons information

1155
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,380
right

1156
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,359
can like get reorganized and go to

1157
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,000
another group of neurons

1158
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,319
Vegeta says a lot of people think their

1159
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,300
symptoms

1160
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,380
sorry I'll start this again a lot of

1161
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:08,160
people think their symptoms are detox

1162
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,040
symptoms when that isn't the case

1163
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,440
correct

1164
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,140
whoa like this is a hot spot right here

1165
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,160
this is no joke I'm actually working on

1166
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,500
a detox podcast right now I'm working on

1167
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,640
one it's not for the faint of heart it

1168
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,099
is a serious episode and it's kicking my

1169
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,920
ass right now because there's so much

1170
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,599
information in this episode that I'm

1171
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,579
just like oh

1172
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,740
a lot of people think their symptoms are

1173
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,500
detox says

1174
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,480
on YouTube symptoms when that isn't the

1175
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,880
case if you are doing what medical

1176
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,460
medium recommends then anything beyond

1177
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,660
very mild symptoms are from something

1178
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,380
else

1179
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,380
it's very wise

1180
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,940
okay

1181
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,859
check this out too and if any of the

1182
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,480
neurons in that new group are damaged

1183
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,400
hindered or injured when the information

1184
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,640
gathered by that electricity gets

1185
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,619
disorganized once again and it leaves

1186
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,480
another group of neuron so okay let me

1187
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,579
just say this

1188
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,319
the information is traveling through

1189
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,500
electricity it hits a group of neurons

1190
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:19,079
that are all clouded up with toxins then

1191
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,700
get scrambled and then leaves that group

1192
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,440
of neurons and enters another group of

1193
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,119
neurons

1194
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,520
so it's not just brain tissue that

1195
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,200
Harbors thoughts and controls controls

1196
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,300
how we feel and how we physically

1197
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,460
function electricity itself has also the

1198
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,339
power over our thoughts and physical

1199
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,900
control it's not medical research and

1200
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,740
science has no idea the electricity

1201
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,740
Harbors a thought

1202
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,619
they think it's the thought it's just in

1203
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:45,619
the brain tissue

1204
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,880
one job of neurons is to eventually pass

1205
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,319
along information to the brain's

1206
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,180
billions of glial cells where

1207
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,160
information stays stored cataloged and

1208
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,140
organized if glial cells are clogged

1209
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,240
contaminated saturated distorted or even

1210
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,040
mutated from poisons and toxins that

1211
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,480
disconnect and break down can occur

1212
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,640
between your neuron system and your

1213
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,020
glial cell system glial cells can lose

1214
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,940
their ability to properly store

1215
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,520
information so basically your glial

1216
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,740
stores storage glial cell storage can

1217
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,160
get all contaminated

1218
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,440
and really toxic and when thoughts are

1219
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,140
stored in that contaminated toxic Arena

1220
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,420
that's another problem all on its own

1221
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,800
some neurons in the brain not all have

1222
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,599
the ability to spot check and

1223
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,339
cross-reference new information with old

1224
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,040
information so we do have a safe fault

1225
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:34,800
in here where some neurons are like

1226
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,359
correct corrected corrected correct it

1227
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,980
correct it there's neurons in our brain

1228
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,560
they're like no we're here to correct

1229
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,180
all that skewed information it's amazing

1230
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,859
Who would know this

1231
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,380
Who would know this

1232
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:48,140
if you have a hard time I'm hearing this

1233
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,780
more and more if you have a hard time

1234
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:54,480
thinking or believing

1235
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,619
that these eight incredible books of

1236
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,440
information

1237
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,780
life-saving information came from above

1238
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,300
if you have a hard time believing that

1239
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:06,540
and that's in your way like you you're

1240
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,619
just like this guy's hearing a

1241
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,720
voice

1242
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,819
right if you're having a hard time and

1243
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,380
you believe that

1244
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:15,359
if it makes you feel better just think

1245
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,920
I'm a genius

1246
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,900
it's not a voice

1247
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,300
and I'm a genius

1248
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,819
anything to make sure you get the

1249
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,260
information in this resource so you can

1250
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:28,140
protect yourself your family friends and

1251
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,720
heal so just you can be like

1252
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:34,500
he doesn't hear a voice he's just a

1253
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:38,780
genius then find whatever it takes

1254
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,780
I can promise you this I'm not a genius

1255
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,880
definitely not a genius

1256
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,880
I wish I was that would be pretty cool

1257
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,540
some neurons in the brain not all have

1258
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,160
the ability to spot check and

1259
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:57,000
cross-reference the information like I

1260
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:59,940
said when healthy when okay when healthy

1261
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,920
these neurons have infinite access to

1262
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,020
glial storage so here's there's neurons

1263
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,560
in our brain that have access to our

1264
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:09,300
memories in the gliobank electricity

1265
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,980
shoots out or waves from these neurons

1266
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,420
rolling along real cells to gather

1267
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,520
information and then the electricity

1268
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,920
filled that real cell information rolls

1269
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,920
back to the neurons that is utterly

1270
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,920
insane

1271
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:26,400
get ready for this when electricity hits

1272
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,099
a damaged neuron on the other hand small

1273
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,380
outward explosions occur off the neuron

1274
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:34,859
kind of like salt kind of like solar

1275
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,579
flares off the sun these flares enter

1276
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:41,160
adjacent brain tissue and glial cells

1277
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:43,020
Gathering bits and pieces of information

1278
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,260
and then subside and re-enter the

1279
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:49,800
neurons okay that is like what the heck

1280
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:53,520
when that information came down

1281
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,660
from above I was just like how do I even

1282
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,660
talk about this

1283
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:03,780
so when electricity hits damaged neurons

1284
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,480
it explodes

1285
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,160
and small explosions occur and

1286
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,839
leave

1287
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,020
and enter

1288
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,700
into uh into the glial cells Gathering

1289
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,000
bits a piece of information and coming

1290
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,000
back

1291
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,260
since the neurons by the way

1292
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:24,359
20 years from now whatever it is or

1293
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,280
maybe even tomorrow a podcast doctor

1294
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:27,900
will be talking about this this they

1295
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,880
won't have a study that actually shows

1296
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,400
anything they'll say they do or

1297
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,859
something or not even they'll just use

1298
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,960
this 20 years from now this is just

1299
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:39,420
going to be literally the Forefront of

1300
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,400
brain inflammation

1301
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,800
we're we're at a really difficult

1302
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,540
situation now medical medium and our

1303
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,880
team and everything else

1304
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,559
cooling Spirit of compassion where the

1305
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,280
thefting and poaching of medical medium

1306
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,200
information for Sciences use is utterly

1307
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,579
at an unbelievable level right now

1308
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,260
including

1309
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:59,460
people in Alternative Health in every

1310
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,619
world

1311
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,780
and the poaching and not citing has

1312
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:06,000
become actually disgusting it is at a

1313
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,800
point where

1314
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,920
you guys

1315
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:13,440
I can't even go there right

1316
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,300
anyway there's so much information here

1317
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,119
I'm just going through it a little bit

1318
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,619
so I'm on page 14 of brain saver

1319
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,420
so maybe let's cut through a little bit

1320
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,520
more if you guys have have you know it

1321
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,500
in you

1322
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,839
meaning like all of us here because we

1323
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,099
want to make the shot we want to make

1324
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,500
the shot

1325
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:33,540
the reason we can each experience the

1326
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,400
same event so differently from each

1327
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,619
other is because of our damaged neurons

1328
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:41,520
leading to disorganized information

1329
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:44,160
someone can say no I

1330
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,359
saw a spaceship

1331
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,640
it landed behind those woods

1332
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:52,440
and another person would be like that

1333
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,660
wasn't a spaceship

1334
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,880
that was car lights

1335
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,839
coming off the highway the distant

1336
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,839
Highway

1337
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:03,780
another person's like no I saw a

1338
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:06,000
spaceship you don't get it it really did

1339
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,040
land I saw what happened it had lights

1340
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,280
on it and that spaceship came down it

1341
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,280
was like

1342
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,599
and landed behind those woods and then

1343
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:18,180
this other person who saw the same thing

1344
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,079
is like no I didn't see a spaceship yeah

1345
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:21,359
but

1346
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,640
yeah but it was there no I saw

1347
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,020
headlights you know the truck was

1348
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,400
getting off the highway way in the

1349
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,900
distance down there and I saw flashing

1350
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,640
lights from it you know that's your

1351
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,619
perception that's what you think you saw

1352
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,599
but there was a spaceship that landed

1353
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:37,220
behind the woods and there really was a

1354
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,220
spaceship that landed behind the woods

1355
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,020
so the reason we can each experience the

1356
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,819
same event so differently from each

1357
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,160
other is because of our damaged neurons

1358
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:49,319
leading to disorganized information in

1359
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,180
the end we may not all give an accurate

1360
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,980
account of what happens so that person's

1361
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,480
like no there was no spaceship that was

1362
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,400
car had lights another person's like I

1363
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,740
promise you behind that behind that

1364
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,020
small mountain is the spaceship that

1365
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,839
landed in those woods Carrie Pearson

1366
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,640
said it's so us exclamation point I just

1367
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,579
saw another big article

1368
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,280
sitting citing your information and not

1369
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,760
crediting you but citing Stanford oh I

1370
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,059
got it citing my information to Stanford

1371
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,500
and it was word for word your info yeah

1372
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:21,480
they're doing that all the time right

1373
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,160
now it's so sad because that means no

1374
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,900
citing means no one will know where it

1375
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,040
came from but they'll think that they're

1376
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,420
smart

1377
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,859
and then when someone mentions that

1378
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:32,059
mentions mm they'll be like oh that

1379
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:32,059
Medium God he's not smart

1380
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,599
it's actually really bad

1381
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,480
and then that person will go off and do

1382
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,740
bad stuff to hurt themselves and they're

1383
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,119
sick for another 10 years because

1384
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,559
they'll never trust the medical medium

1385
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:46,140
in a million years because they heard so

1386
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,400
much bad stuff by the way you guys the

1387
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,079
hit piece is coming out of me

1388
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,180
periodically over the years and the hit

1389
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:52,920
pieces that are on their way because

1390
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,260
that's what's just always happening to

1391
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,359
me with all the just stories

1392
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,300
and lies is unbelievable the media has

1393
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,980
never ever represented well actually no

1394
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,260
that's not true there has been some

1395
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,900
media Outlets that have that have had my

1396
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,400
back but for the most part most all

1397
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,619
don't

1398
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,619
you know and definitely not fully

1399
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,400
say we were camping out by a lake with

1400
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,460
friends in a flashing light flew through

1401
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,920
the sky one person may say I was there

1402
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,960
and it was a firefly

1403
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,839
someone else may say

1404
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,540
I was there too it was a falling star

1405
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,700
someone else believed it was a distant

1406
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,400
headlight from a truck farther off

1407
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,980
toward the horizon

1408
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,200
one person thought it was a firefly

1409
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,760
another person's you know thought it was

1410
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,040
a falling star and somebody else thought

1411
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,780
it was a truck it's a different thing

1412
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,700
one than the spaceship thing I was

1413
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,380
saying but all the same

1414
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,300
this understanding of our neurons

1415
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,980
impeded functioning is why when we ask

1416
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,960
if someone's feeling okay we should

1417
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,240
really ask how's the electricity in your

1418
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,220
brain it's like are you okay today how

1419
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,440
you feeling today it's more like

1420
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,339
how's the electricity going through your

1421
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,339
neurons today

1422
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,140
are they disorganized

1423
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,160
how are the neuro how are your neurons

1424
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,079
today

1425
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,359
have any of them repaired from your

1426
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:17,099
night's sleep have your neurons repaired

1427
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,140
from your night's sleep

1428
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,760
have your glial cells been heating up

1429
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,859
too much lately

1430
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,440
are your neurons saturated into toxins

1431
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:27,240
today communicating about our brains at

1432
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,520
this level would bring about a whole new

1433
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,320
understanding of our health conditions

1434
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,440
and well-being

1435
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,800
[Music]

1436
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,800
all right

1437
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,819
we're in this incredible speaking your

1438
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,380
truth stabilizer that was just really

1439
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:44,579
really incredible killer brain

1440
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,339
inflammation

1441
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:49,200
that you know that I want to show you

1442
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:50,880
from Spirit of compassion but we're

1443
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,740
doing speaking your treat stabilizer

1444
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,619
right now

1445
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,000
that information I just read you

1446
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:59,000
is

1447
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,160
really profound

1448
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,740
mind-blowing when I wrote that

1449
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,000
information down

1450
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,000
I was mind blown

1451
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:13,819
all right we're good speaking your truth

1452
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,819
stabilizer

1453
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,859
I'm gonna put the brain back together a

1454
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,400
little bit right there

1455
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:22,400
foreign

1456
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:30,980
all right

1457
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,980
let's do this

1458
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,180
I have my juicer in front of me

1459
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,200
look

1460
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:43,980
it's no secret

1461
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,319
I get asked about celery juice

1462
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,960
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

1463
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,880
of times it's a wonder I haven't lost my

1464
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,220
mind completely right

1465
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,980
because the questions are this

1466
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:59,160
can I I'm doing celery juice and I put

1467
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,839
lemon in it I doing celery juice from

1468
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,119
the store

1469
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:05,040
that was in a bottle you know what I

1470
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,720
mean whatever

1471
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm doing this all these things and then

1472
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,880
what juicer do you use what juicer do

1473
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,400
you use and I get questions like that

1474
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,319
over and over and over again anyway this

1475
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,220
is the MN 1500 I'm using right now

1476
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,000
mm-900 is another incredible juicer

1477
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,819
um

1478
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,740
and so every day it's like when is the

1479
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:27,660
sale when is the sale when is the sale

1480
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,000

1491
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,299
are rising

1492
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,680
they're Rising now here's something I

1493
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:57,119
wanted to say real quick before we make

1494
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,079
this job

1495
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:03,540
I could have started a medical medium

1496
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:07,619
juicing company 20 years ago

1497
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:10,020
okay and been asked to do so and

1498
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:12,960
literally I could be known as the juicer

1499
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,760
guy and that's not what I did and we

1500
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,880
don't want to do that

1501
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,819
but food costs were rising and I noticed

1502
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,640
the juicers out there

1503
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:27,359
we're not squeezing enough juice out of

1504
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:30,420
the out of the produce and people who

1505
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,880
need to use these medical machines to

1506
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:37,079
heal and get better

1507
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:39,720
don't have a lot of money

1508
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,900
sure rich people get sick too

1509
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,480
okay and I get it and it probably rich

1510
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,520
people who have a billion dollars can

1511
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,900
buy all the produce they want and it

1512
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,980
doesn't matter what juicer they use I

1513
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,920
guess

1514
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:56,099
but the point is

1515
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,440
is that the prices Sonia said celery

1516
00:59:56,099 --> 01:00:00,119
prices went up too like the food costs

1517
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,339
are insane right

1518
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,880
but I don't want people to lose chances

1519
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:09,480
of using medicinal tools that can help

1520
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,740
them heal so I got involved with the mm

1521
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:16,020
1500 mm-900 for a reason because I knew

1522
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:18,780
through Spirit of compassion that we

1523
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:21,540
were again gonna get a huge food cost

1524
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,540
increase in the world and that's meat

1525
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:26,880
that's beef that's grass-fed beef that's

1526
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:29,760
Dairy that's eggs that's wheat that's

1527
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,040
fruits that's vegetables that's nuts

1528
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,960
that's seeds whatever it is

1529
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:38,280
whatever anybody eats on this planet

1530
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:41,460
rice beans whatever it's up boots McGee

1531
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,380
says aw is it's totally true I even had

1532
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,020
rose-colored glasses thinking I did all

1533
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:48,000
medical medium my first years and looked

1534
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,040
back and I was eating dairy and gluten

1535
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,319
all the time it boots McGee thank you

1536
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,119

1537
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,260

so anyway

1545
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,040
Spirit of compassion predicted that food

1546
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,599
costs were going to go up and if you're

1547
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,859
like oh well then I won't get the juicer

1548
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,260
because I don't want to spend money on

1549
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:20,579
produce no food costs are going up for

1550
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:25,400
all food everything beans rice peas

1551
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:28,079
grains Dairy meat fish it's all going up

1552
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,520
eggs whatever here in egg eater it's all

1553
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,680
going up Carrie pierce it says the Omega

1554
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,319
mm is saving me so much money I bought

1555
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,720
it on payments and it is paying for

1556
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,059
itself every month in the dollars I save

1557
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,760
I swear to God

1558
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,260
I'm saving money when I use the mm 1500

1559
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,480
and mm-900

1560
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:48,180
I know because I've used all the other

1561
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,839
juicers and I had to buy more heads of

1562
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:53,579
celery more things and More Produce and

1563
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:55,500
I got less juice so there's these

1564
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:56,880
spinning basket juices out there and

1565
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,819
everybody's like oh those are the ones

1566
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,579
to get don't get the mm juicers get

1567
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:04,140
these spinning baskets that are

1568
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:05,640
you know promoted by whatever

1569
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,339
influencers involved whatever the

1570
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,200
whatever it is right and

1571
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:11,579
but what people don't realize is you got

1572
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,640
to be rich

1573
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:17,760
in my opinion you gotta be

1574
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,440
freaking rich because those just you got

1575
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,180
to put a lot more produce in those

1576
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,619
juicers sure it may feel like it's

1577
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,299
easier and you got your basket of juice

1578
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,579
but you have to put a lot more produce

1579
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:28,260
that's what I've learned in all the

1580
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:29,339
different juicer centrifuge ones and

1581
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:33,020
everything

1582
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:33,020
I'm only talking about this because

1583
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:38,400
food costs are actually going up higher

1584
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,740
and higher

1585
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,079
if they're not coming down

1586
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,660
so it's like but we need ways to heal

1587
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:49,079
ourselves we need medicine makers and

1588
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:52,260
Medicine machines if I if I ignore the

1589
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:55,140
food costs going up then I'm actually

1590
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,520
being a jerk

1591
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,020
because

1592
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,180
it's like

1593
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,579
we heal ourselves through our food right

1594
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,859
we heal ourselves through the foods we

1595
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:08,040
eat that's one of the ways we heal

1596
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:11,940
ourselves and if I pretend

1597
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:15,119
that food costs aren't going up

1598
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,980
and never talk about it that's

1599
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,020
because I'm noticing that with the

1600
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,160
podcast doctors out there a lot of

1601
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,540
people in alternative world they're not

1602
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,460
talking about that

1603
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,920
like the influencers who have money

1604
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,540
they're not talking about that because

1605
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,819
it's not hurting them

1606
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,980
when they buy their produce and whatever

1607
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:34,880
no one's talking about it it's like what

1608
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,880
are we trying to hide it

1609
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:43,319
it's like it's like demented the mm9 900

1610
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:45,960
and 1500 are in the description and the

1611
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:48,000
uh bio

1612
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,859
too so just letting you guys know anyway

1613
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,380
I just thought that this was something

1614
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,940
that we shouldn't like pretend doesn't

1615
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,380
exist so noticing that people

1616
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,940
influencers of people want to help

1617
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,220
move-in podcast doctors so they're just

1618
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,359
not even talking about it's like what oh

1619
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,400
that's right because it doesn't affect

1620
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:05,099
you you got money for all the proofs you

1621
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,780
want by the way there's a new omega this

1622
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,579

it's just so you know and if you have

1630
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,819
these juicers and you need a part

1631
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:32,280
something's wrong whatever it is because

1632
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:34,079
we juice like nobody's business like the

1633
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,960
medical medium Community juices like no

1634
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,760
one's ever seen I'm talking about holy

1635
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,760
crap the kind of juicing

1636
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,619
no here's what juicing used to be it

1637
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,119
used to be someone just buying a juicer

1638
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:46,680
it sits in the kitchen goes in the

1639
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,200
closet they take it out once a month

1640
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,579
that like we use these machines like no

1641
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,500
other people in the medical medium

1642
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:54,480
Community use juicers daily sometimes

1643
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,240
three times a day usually for their

1644
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,040
families they're juicing all day long

1645
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,200
and they don't

1646
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,980
they don't just use a juicer once a

1647
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,280
month

1648
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:07,940
or once a week or once in a while

1649
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,940
all right

1650
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,099
but I just don't think it's right

1651
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:16,920
because I notice that

1652
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:20,040
no one's talking about the produce and

1653
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,960
the meat and the whatever industry going

1654
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,460
up in price in the health realm and

1655
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,740
health world no one's talking about it

1656
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,819
and I'm like why why are you not talking

1657
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,040
about it

1658
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:30,660
it's like a car when a car you use a car

1659
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,400
and you beat the hell out of a car and

1660
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,579
you use that car and you drive you get

1661
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,260
200 000 miles on that car it's gonna

1662
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,680
need some parts changed every now and

1663
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:43,920
then and we beat these juicers to a pulp

1664
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,240
and so there's a 15-year warranty on

1665
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,540
this juicer

1666
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:52,680
the powertrain the engine and there's a

1667
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:54,660
15 year warranty on the parts

1668
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,160
other juicers usually only have a two

1669
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,140
year warranty on the parts especially

1670
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,119
the ones the spinning baskets and all

1671
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,260
that crap right anyway I wanted to tell

1672
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:03,420
you guys

1673
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,220
that's what I noticed I was like I know

1674
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,500
this is like a kind of a moment where

1675
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:10,020
we're talking about this but I know this

1676
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,180
nobody else in health like all the big

1677
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:16,020
gurus out there the health gurus out

1678
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:18,000
there and the YouTube doctors and all

1679
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,160
that they're not talking about like the

1680
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,720
food prices going up it doesn't have to

1681
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,660
affect them they got plenty of money

1682
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:28,280
they buy what they want to eat

1683
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,280
but all I can tell you is

1684
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,760
it affects the chronic wheel

1685
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,599
all right right we're going to make the

1686
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:39,539

1691
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:54,000

1693
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,079
Lynn Western says we have used the

1694
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,420
warranty several times and they take

1695
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,880
care of us every time the warranty is

1696
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,980
awesome the new hotline for the medical

1697
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,119
median juicers is a great benefit to all

1698
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,780

one inch piece Ginger coming right up

01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:53,220

1718
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,940

01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,940
garlic going down the chute

1720
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:16,259

half cup tightly packed fresh basil that

one cup roughly chopped lettuce

1731
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,859
such as green leaf or butter leaf

1732
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:15,060
why am I yelling the juicer is quiet

1733
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:16,980
this isn't those loud juicers if you're

1734
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,179
if you're juicing for your family this

1735
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,160
thing is so quiet it doesn't wake

1736
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:23,040
anybody up in the household you can

1737
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:25,259
whisper and still use this juicer why am

1738
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,339
I yelling

1739
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:28,339
getting the lettuce in

1740
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:33,080
one more

1741
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:41,239
another piece here okay and then one

1742
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:41,239
orange peel

1743
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:50,040
where's my fuel door there's my peeled

1744
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:52,020
Orange right there already peeled

1745
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,060
I'm going to send this orange down if

1746
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,199
you guys don't mind I'm just cutting it

1747
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,040
up a little bit

1748
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,040
some pieces

1749
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,699
so one orange

1750
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,360
peeled here

1751
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,179
nice

1752
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,360
there we go incredible

1753
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,340
amazing what you're gonna find with this

1754
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,980
you'll see

1755
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:28,460
the pull okay as it comes out of this

1756
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,460
juicer

1757
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,739
okay

1758
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,739
stride

1759
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,800
much drier

1760
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:42,179
than the other juicers right

1761
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:45,620
that's where the money's at

1762
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:49,020
you would need three oranges

1763
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:51,659
to get the same amount maybe even less

1764
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,920
three oranges with the other juicers now

1765
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:55,920
you can take your time you might have

1766
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,360
some pulp when softer fruits go in with

1767
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,159
this high compression you might have the

1768
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,840
pulp come up here for a little bit you

1769
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:02,820
can take your time and turn it on a

1770
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,679
couple of times and it'll actually suck

1771
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:06,300
it down eventually and you can add other

1772
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,920
stuff too you know through it and it'll

1773
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,100
just clean it right through

1774
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,020
but but the amount saved is unbelievable

1775
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,300
from this process

1776
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,100
I'm not kidding like it's incredible

1777
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,300
actually

1778
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,360
foreign

1779
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,340
like it's a lot more juice

1780
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:27,060
that's the other thing too if you're

1781
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,380
using the mm1500 the mm-900 you're going

1782
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,780
to get more

1783
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,400
from the ingredients that you're putting

1784
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,900
in for these brain shots or any kind of

1785
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,120
juicing you do

1786
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,920
I actually saw there was someone who

1787
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,659
showed me um something that was on

1788
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,980
television one of the main networks and

1789
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,760
they were doing a little juicing on

1790
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:45,120
there

1791
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,520
and the amount of produce they threw

1792
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,040
through their juicer

1793
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,020
one of the you know whatever thing which

1794
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,640
is the amount of carrots everything it

1795
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,800
was a joke what they got in the end and

1796
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,940
I was like sitting there like oh my God

1797
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,659

got enough for the easy couple okay

1809
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,280
people ask what the difference is

1810
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,470
between the 900 and the 1500 that's the

1811
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:41,350
difference right there

brain really fast right to the emotional

1820
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,820
center of the brain and it just blows it

1821
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:12,060
up because what it's doing is it's

1822
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:15,120
releasing stuff so you can think clearer

1823
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:18,380
