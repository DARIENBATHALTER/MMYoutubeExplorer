[846.76 - 850.28] I'm that I'm renting for for that like
[848.76 - 854.84] week
[850.28 - 858.16] and I'm only 20 minutes away as well
[854.84 - 860.68] excited from Holland
[858.16 - 863.20] yeah
[860.68 - 864.36] incredible Josh says I wish I could make
[863.20 - 866.68] it
[864.36 - 869.56] bummer
[866.68 - 871.48] god well listen for anybody who can't
[869.56 - 873.32] make it I completely understand I
[871.48 - 876.04] totally understand and there's got to be
[873.32 - 877.60] reasons why you can't make it and um I'm
[876.04 - 880.16] honored that you're even trying I'm
[877.60 - 882.24] honored that you even care and uh for
[880.16 - 884.44] anybody who can't make it totally
[882.24 - 887.52] understand completely understand okay
[884.44 - 889.28] and I'm behind you 100%
[887.52 - 892.16] 100% all
[889.28 - 895.72] right what happens is there's a battle
[892.16 - 897.44] in our brains you see it out there
[895.72 - 901.96] people are lost and
[897.44 - 904.88] confused and it is isn't just from
[901.96 - 907.40] stress somebody can be lost and
[904.88 - 910.64] confused and there's no stress very
[907.40 - 912.56] little stress somebody can be under
[910.64 - 915.40] tremendous stress and not lost and
[912.56 - 917.04] confused what do I mean by that doubting
[915.40 - 920.08] themselves
[917.04 - 921.60] fear just fear deep down
[920.08 - 925.28] inside
[921.60 - 927.08] doubt right feeling like they're the
[925.28 - 929.72] problem that's something that happens
[927.08 - 931.52] all the time and then PT PD that won't
[929.72 - 932.52] go away so many people have that as well
[931.52 - 935.40] and then there's people that have
[932.52 - 939.92] anxiety Panic
[935.40 - 942.56] nervousness their feet sweat all the
[939.92 - 946.04] time there's PE then there's just people
[942.56 - 948.64] that have like the sweating
[946.04 - 951.36] conditions where they're sweating all
[948.64 - 952.72] the time everywhere they're drenched
[951.36 - 955.12] they don't even need a reason to be
[952.72 - 956.96] drenched and their body is drenched with
[955.12 - 962.72] sweat whole bunch of people go through
[956.96 - 965.28] that too metals Metals Metals Metals
[962.72 - 967.12] yeah even with all that hyperhydrosis
[965.28 - 968.92] even with all that sweating and
[967.12 - 970.08] different things that people deal with
[968.92 - 972.80] and then there's the people with
[970.08 - 973.76] migraines and headaches and migraines
[972.80 - 976.36] and
[973.76 - 978.04] headaches I say that over and over again
[976.36 - 980.96] because people go from migraines to
[978.04 - 983.36] headaches to headaches to bad migraines
[980.96 - 985.48] back to migraines to headaches and they
[983.36 - 987.36] live with their headache and then turns
[985.48 - 989.40] into a big migraine
[987.36 - 992.36] again and then there's people with all
[989.40 - 994.60] kinds of skin conditions they got eczema
[992.36 - 996.20] really bad and psoriasis really bad and
[994.60 - 999.52] other types of skin conditions too and
[996.20 - 1001.40] Vio as well and then there's the people
[999.52 - 1003.04] that are emotionally and mentally
[1001.40 - 1004.48] struggling like there's a battle in
[1003.04 - 1005.76] their mind and a battle in their head
[1004.48 - 1008.12] and they got the
[1005.76 - 1009.64] OCD and the dep personalization where
[1008.12 - 1012.08] they're so disconnected and they feel
[1009.64 - 1014.00] numb but they don't know why and then
[1012.08 - 1017.88] there's people who feel like they have a
[1014.00 - 1019.48] decent life my life is good my life can
[1017.88 - 1022.60] be better
[1019.48 - 1026.08] I want to be productive my life is is is
[1022.60 - 1029.96] going good but I am disconnected and
[1026.08 - 1031.44] numb numb and I don't feel anything
[1029.96 - 1033.08] there's so bunch of people that just
[1031.44 - 1035.32] don't feel
[1033.08 - 1038.80] anything where they're just like they
[1035.32 - 1042.28] don't feel anything nothing excites them
[1038.80 - 1045.24] nothing feeds into passion or turns into
[1042.28 - 1047.28] passion nothing they can't even find
[1045.24 - 1049.08] compassion they have it somewhere they
[1047.28 - 1050.72] can't even find compassion for for
[1049.08 - 1052.28] someone or for something that's
[1050.72 - 1055.36] happening at there they can't find
[1052.28 - 1057.76] compassion because they're so numb and
[1055.36 - 1060.68] they're they're so disconnected they
[1057.76 - 1062.88] feel they have this deep
[1060.68 - 1065.52] depersonalization that they can't they
[1062.88 - 1068.48] can't connect and they can't make that
[1065.52 - 1071.52] connection and bypass it they can't
[1068.48 - 1072.76] overcome it and they can't supersede it
[1071.52 - 1075.52] and they live with it and they wake up
[1072.76 - 1077.56] the morning and it's back to that again
[1075.52 - 1079.32] they're numb they wake up in the morning
[1077.56 - 1082.32] and they're disconnected and numb and
[1079.32 - 1085.80] it's back to that every single day they
[1082.32 - 1088.40] go to bed depressed and sad or they get
[1085.80 - 1089.64] angry as the night goes on do you know
[1088.40 - 1092.76] any of those
[1089.64 - 1095.80] people as the night goes on something
[1092.76 - 1097.64] can trigger them and they get
[1095.80 - 1100.92] angry or
[1097.64 - 1104.76] angrier here it is midnight and they're
[1100.92 - 1107.84] angry now and they can't shake it before
[1104.76 - 1110.52] they go to bed anybody ever seen that or
[1107.84 - 1114.00] gone through that or over there says on
[1110.52 - 1116.20] YouTube is profuse sweating from weak
[1114.00 - 1118.28] adrenals or Metals let's get into that a
[1116.20 - 1119.88] little bit you see this right here why
[1118.28 - 1123.16] is this
[1119.88 - 1125.20] here oh why is this
[1123.16 - 1128.56] here because I was going to talk about
[1125.20 - 1130.64] how toxic heavy metals weaken adrenals
[1128.56 - 1133.88] because they put pressure on the nervous
[1130.64 - 1136.88] system forcing the adrenals to react all
[1133.88 - 1138.92] the time creating a sweating problem for
[1136.88 - 1142.80] a lot of people hyperhydrosis
[1138.92 - 1147.88] bunch of sweating problem profuse
[1142.80 - 1150.64] sweating yes also adrenaline surges
[1147.88 - 1153.64] happening all the time heart rate
[1150.64 - 1156.80] increasing happening all the time toxic
[1153.64 - 1160.56] heavy metals inside the brain can make
[1156.80 - 1164.08] it so it's putting stress on the central
[1160.56 - 1166.40] nervous system causing
[1164.08 - 1169.36] problems causing
[1166.40 - 1170.64] problems stress on the nervous system
[1169.36 - 1175.40] causing
[1170.64 - 1177.68] problems making it so the adrenals are
[1175.40 - 1179.60] pumping too much so the adrenals are
[1177.68 - 1181.80] cranked up too
[1179.60 - 1184.16] much so what happens with a lot of
[1181.80 - 1187.16] people they get this nervousness from
[1184.16 - 1190.12] the toxic heavy metals the nervosus all
[1187.16 - 1193.12] all falls into adrenals pumping like
[1190.12 - 1197.20] crazy adrenaline pouring
[1193.12 - 1200.28] out pouring out every day feet sweating
[1197.20 - 1204.00] hands sweating it's not even just that
[1200.28 - 1204.00] heart going a little
[1204.76 - 1208.72] faster okay let's get into it a little
[1206.64 - 1211.00] bit the battle in our
[1208.72 - 1213.36] brains your brain is
[1211.00 - 1215.52] electricity and within that
[1213.36 - 1217.64] electricity we have
[1215.52 - 1220.20] obstacles a lot of people have a lot of
[1217.64 - 1222.16] obstacles to to overcome with
[1220.20 - 1224.88] electricity in the brain let's hit it
[1222.16 - 1224.88] for a second
[1225.04 - 1231.16] here put a little board right do a
[1229.32 - 1234.40] little brain stuff really quick okay you
[1231.16 - 1234.40] guys let's get a brain
[1234.68 - 1240.48] going all
[1236.80 - 1243.96] right get a little bit of a mid midline
[1240.48 - 1248.52] Canal okay and then we got a
[1243.96 - 1253.28] brain instant brain here we
[1248.52 - 1256.04] go okay we got our brain let's go let's
[1253.28 - 1259.92] get some metal deposits can you see this
[1256.04 - 1262.56] got a metal deposit Mercury a aluminum
[1259.92 - 1267.16] cadmium lead
[1262.56 - 1268.60] arsenic copper copper is a bad one real
[1267.16 - 1272.84] real bad
[1268.60 - 1274.44] one it is okay we got electricity
[1272.84 - 1278.56] running through the
[1274.44 - 1279.80] brain electricity runs through the brain
[1278.56 - 1283.92] see this you
[1279.80 - 1286.08] guys okay electricity is energy it
[1283.92 - 1288.80] radiates off your
[1286.08 - 1291.92] head electricity in your brain has
[1288.80 - 1294.84] energy radiating off your head that's
[1291.92 - 1296.68] why this electricity is radiating
[1294.84 - 1300.44] somewhere out here you see
[1296.68 - 1304.08] this okay here's a metal deposit here's
[1300.44 - 1308.08] an electrical impulse here it is
[1304.08 - 1312.36] electricity boom it hit the metal
[1308.08 - 1316.64] deposit right there short circuit
[1312.36 - 1320.04] happens and then the adrenals so let's
[1316.64 - 1322.28] get some adrenals going really quick
[1320.04 - 1322.28] all
[1322.72 - 1327.96] right then we got some adrenals down
[1325.12 - 1327.96] here you guys see
[1328.44 - 1333.68] this right
[1331.16 - 1337.60] electricity hits the metal
[1333.68 - 1340.28] deposit the neurons are under stress a
[1337.60 - 1343.52] signal goes to the
[1340.28 - 1346.68] adrenals here the adrenals are and then
[1343.52 - 1350.52] the adrenals release
[1346.68 - 1350.52] adrenaline there it is
[1352.24 - 1358.28] Metals in the brain can cause anxiety
[1355.28 - 1361.08] fear panic panic
[1358.28 - 1364.72] attacks depression
[1361.08 - 1366.48] anxiousness all in one go or even just
[1364.72 - 1368.80] little bits and pieces of that from
[1366.48 - 1375.52] toxic heavy metals in the
[1368.80 - 1378.12] brain toxic heavy metal aluminum Mercury
[1375.52 - 1379.20] electrical electricity running through
[1378.12 - 1381.92] the brain
[1379.20 - 1384.72] hits the copper deposit yep copper
[1381.92 - 1386.48] deposit you see this puts stress on all
[1384.72 - 1390.36] the neurons and gleo
[1386.48 - 1392.88] cells and then the adrenals release more
[1390.36 - 1396.36] adrenaline do you guys see this there it
[1392.88 - 1399.60] is okay and that's just
[1396.36 - 1401.88] something that happens right there
[1399.60 - 1403.60] that's just something that
[1401.88 - 1405.76] happens all
[1403.60 - 1407.44] right we're going to hit something
[1405.76 - 1409.84] really serious
[1407.44 - 1410.92] here
[1409.84 - 1414.04] living
[1410.92 - 1417.72] Metal Dead
[1414.04 - 1419.84] metal living Metal Dead
[1417.72 - 1424.76] metal in your
[1419.84 - 1426.40] brain lies living Metals metals that are
[1424.76 - 1428.84] alive
[1426.40 - 1430.68] vital soft
[1428.84 - 1433.68] metals good
[1430.68 - 1438.44] Metals even tiny
[1433.68 - 1442.44] traces of heavy metal that's not toxic
[1438.44 - 1447.80] toic it's in Trace forms like
[1442.44 - 1451.92] gold gold inside our brains tiny Trace
[1447.80 - 1455.20] forms of gold that come from our food
[1451.92 - 1457.20] sources and Gold's a heavy metal that
[1455.20 - 1460.20] resides in our
[1457.20 - 1463.60] brain but it's a living
[1460.20 - 1466.88] metal it's coming from the food we grow
[1463.60 - 1469.08] it's in its Trace form and it's a living
[1466.88 - 1472.16] metal and then
[1469.08 - 1475.40] you have dead Metals industrialized
[1472.16 - 1478.88] Metals copper that was industrialized
[1475.40 - 1480.44] Mercury that was industrialized aluminum
[1478.88 - 1481.32] that was industrialized people say he
[1480.44 - 1484.32] doesn't know what he's talking about
[1481.32 - 1489.80] aluminum is not a heavy metal it's
[1484.32 - 1491.96] light i s first of all since science is
[1489.80 - 1495.44] taking lots of medical medium
[1491.96 - 1498.56] information for instance right long flu
[1495.44 - 1500.56] you guys years ago I did a video all
[1498.56 - 1502.32] about how the flu can knock the immune
[1500.56 - 1504.32] system down creating chronic illness
[1502.32 - 1505.76] long after the flu is gone and I talked
[1504.32 - 1508.52] all about that the medical medium
[1505.76 - 1509.88] information by the way and now science
[1508.52 - 1511.88] is doing articles they're talking about
[1509.88 - 1513.44] it where it's long flu right they just
[1511.88 - 1517.44] took it from medical medium that's just
[1513.44 - 1520.64] one example life expectancy I
[1517.44 - 1526.56] predicted Spirit of compassion
[1520.64 - 1528.04] did predict it that we were dropping in
[1526.56 - 1531.32] life expectancy the numbers were
[1528.04 - 1533.96] dropping dropping the years someone
[1531.32 - 1536.92] lives was dropping everybody ignored it
[1533.96 - 1538.52] out there the industry science all of it
[1536.92 - 1540.76] ignored it they thought we were living
[1538.52 - 1542.84] longer and that the expectancy was going
[1540.76 - 1544.56] longer and longer turns out they're
[1542.84 - 1546.36] wrong so they went to Medical meme
[1544.56 - 1550.24] information published information they
[1546.36 - 1553.48] remove the part where life expectancy is
[1550.24 - 1556.48] dropping so because of this and long flu
[1553.48 - 1558.76] is in medical medium book one by the
[1556.48 - 1561.80] way right here the new
[1558.76 - 1563.68] addition because of this science keeps
[1561.80 - 1565.88] on stealing and robbing information from
[1563.68 - 1568.68] medical medium books including the cause
[1565.88 - 1571.44] of multiple sceris which is epen
[1568.68 - 1574.72] bar so what happened
[1571.44 - 1575.64] was Spirit of compassion deemed aluminum
[1574.72 - 1578.04] Heavy
[1575.64 - 1580.80] Metal the reason why is because of the
[1578.04 - 1583.64] extensive damage it does in someone's
[1580.80 - 1585.76] life for one too much aluminum in the
[1583.64 - 1588.76] brain can cause a problem creating a
[1585.76 - 1591.28] situation where their body doesn't
[1588.76 - 1593.24] function like it should creating a
[1591.28 - 1595.24] situation where people feel like their
[1593.24 - 1596.80] legs are made out of lead and their body
[1595.24 - 1599.40] can barely
[1596.80 - 1602.20] function it's heavy damage substantial
[1599.40 - 1604.96] damage on people's body and
[1602.20 - 1606.72] brains all kinds of different issues in
[1604.96 - 1608.84] the brain that people have different
[1606.72 - 1611.24] conditions they have because of aluminum
[1608.84 - 1613.56] aluminum is dangerous when it sits
[1611.24 - 1616.56] inside of our brain and
[1613.56 - 1620.04] corrodes and outp
[1616.56 - 1622.80] pockets and leeches
[1620.04 - 1626.88] so medical me books have deemed aluminum
[1622.80 - 1629.12] a toxic heavy metal versus a light metal
[1626.88 - 1631.00] because of the substantial damage it
[1629.12 - 1632.04] does and probably 5 years from now or
[1631.00 - 1634.60] seven years from now they're just going
[1632.04 - 1637.84] to call it a toxic heavy metal which I
[1634.60 - 1640.44] actually saw they've already done that
[1637.84 - 1643.16] recently anyway the whole point I'm
[1640.44 - 1645.44] trying to say is that we have living
[1643.16 - 1648.32] Metals inside of our head and we have
[1645.44 - 1649.40] dead Metals inside of our head and these
[1648.32 - 1652.00] dead
[1649.40 - 1653.68] Metals interact and they battle the
[1652.00 - 1658.52] living
[1653.68 - 1662.16] Metals so we have metals that are useful
[1658.52 - 1664.40] in their form they're soft
[1662.16 - 1667.52] Metals they're heavy
[1664.40 - 1669.40] metals but we have them in Trace forms
[1667.52 - 1672.24] from our
[1669.40 - 1675.08] food and they actually sit inside of our
[1672.24 - 1677.24] brain and they help to make up a
[1675.08 - 1680.40] neurotransmitter they help to support a
[1677.24 - 1683.64] neurotransmitter and they help to feed
[1680.40 - 1685.64] and keep alive neurons and allow neurons
[1683.64 - 1687.24] to have electricity run through them so
[1685.64 - 1688.76] here's how it
[1687.24 - 1690.76] works
[1688.76 - 1694.48] okay if you
[1690.76 - 1697.72] have right if you have a
[1694.48 - 1700.08] neuron right here there's lots of
[1697.72 - 1701.40] neurons in our brain you guys all know
[1700.08 - 1703.40] that you have a neuron so I'm just
[1701.40 - 1707.12] making a big
[1703.40 - 1709.32] neuron okay if that
[1707.12 - 1711.04] neuron
[1709.32 - 1713.80] if that neuron is
[1711.04 - 1717.16] filled with living
[1713.80 - 1719.84] Metals soft Metals heavy metals but
[1717.16 - 1722.56] living metals that come from your food
[1719.84 - 1724.88] supply if you got living Metals in here
[1722.56 - 1726.92] in this neuron that neuron is going to
[1724.88 - 1728.96] do this when electricity goes to it
[1726.92 - 1731.92] ready here's electricity again here we
[1728.96 - 1734.64] go there's an electricity right here it
[1731.92 - 1737.56] is Boom it hit that neuron that neuron's
[1734.64 - 1739.92] packed with living Metals it hits the
[1737.56 - 1742.44] neuron the neuron takes that
[1739.92 - 1745.20] electricity places information on that
[1742.44 - 1748.28] electrical impulse travels to another
[1745.20 - 1750.12] neuron that is also filled with all
[1748.28 - 1752.32] these living Metals the living metals
[1750.12 - 1754.96] are the conductors they're the
[1752.32 - 1757.20] conductors of that electricity inside
[1754.96 - 1760.04] the neuron so they can travel with
[1757.20 - 1765.16] information from neuron to neuron but
[1760.04 - 1767.64] when our neurons are lacking living
[1765.16 - 1770.04] metals and they're filled with dead
[1767.64 - 1772.72] metals
[1770.04 - 1775.16] that's when we're in really big trouble
[1772.72 - 1777.12] when they're filled with dead Metals so
[1775.16 - 1778.64] what happens when these neurons are
[1777.12 - 1781.16] filled with dead metal so let's make a
[1778.64 - 1783.36] neuron and we'll put a nice big neuron
[1781.16 - 1784.56] right here nice big neuron right there
[1783.36 - 1788.20] put one here
[1784.56 - 1792.60] too all right the neuron is filled with
[1788.20 - 1795.48] dead Metals copper Mercury aluminum
[1792.60 - 1798.88] arsenic lead
[1795.48 - 1799.80] cadmium there's more but we could sit
[1798.88 - 1802.64] here all
[1799.80 - 1804.72] day okay here they are dead metals are
[1802.64 - 1807.72] in here get ready when the electricity
[1804.72 - 1811.00] heads their way electricity is heading
[1807.72 - 1813.28] its way here it is electrical impulse
[1811.00 - 1815.12] that's your life force electricity in
[1813.28 - 1816.84] your brain here it goes it's going to
[1815.12 - 1819.40] hit a neuron neurons filled with all
[1816.84 - 1822.28] these dead Metals
[1819.40 - 1825.08] boom it's like hitting a brick
[1822.28 - 1828.92] wall and then you're
[1825.08 - 1831.80] like I just don't feel good something's
[1828.92 - 1834.60] off I better make another doctor's
[1831.80 - 1836.36] appointment I better sign up to this
[1834.60 - 1838.76] course that says they're going to cure
[1836.36 - 1841.84] you of every disease for
[1838.76 - 1844.64] $5,000 I better just go see this I
[1841.84 - 1846.72] better go see this person I better fly
[1844.64 - 1849.84] around the world and dip myself in some
[1846.72 - 1851.60] crazy hot spring somewhere but something
[1849.84 - 1854.20] happens where you just you're just like
[1851.60 - 1858.84] something's wrong with me 50 doctors
[1854.20 - 1860.16] later nobody knew that you had
[1858.84 - 1863.68] a
[1860.16 - 1867.60] neuron you had nerve
[1863.68 - 1870.52] cells and they were filled with dead
[1867.60 - 1872.52] metals and when the electricity hit the
[1870.52 - 1875.16] the the neuron with all those dead
[1872.52 - 1875.16] Metals in
[1875.40 - 1881.64] there problems occurred it was like
[1878.40 - 1886.40] hitting a brick a stone
[1881.64 - 1888.44] wall see alridge 741 so when they say
[1886.40 - 1890.92] lesions are on your brain are they
[1888.44 - 1894.12] seeing heavy metal
[1890.92 - 1895.44] deposits all right let's go into the a
[1894.12 - 1898.04] little
[1895.44 - 1900.36] bit when they when they see lesions on
[1898.04 - 1902.32] the brain they don't know what they're
[1900.36 - 1905.20] seeing they could be Heavy Metal
[1902.32 - 1907.92] deposits that have been um leeching
[1905.20 - 1910.60] causing tissue damage gal cell damage
[1907.92 - 1913.92] and so forth brain tissue damage it
[1910.60 - 1916.76] could be an MSG deposit you know many
[1913.92 - 1919.28] people have MSG deposits in their brain
[1916.76 - 1920.60] it leaves all kinds of marks now and
[1919.28 - 1923.92] these better
[1920.60 - 1925.36] MRIs and the way they scan brains now
[1923.92 - 1927.80] they're starting to see stuff all the
[1925.36 - 1929.44] time I called this shot a long time ago
[1927.80 - 1933.00] they're seeing all kinds of different
[1929.44 - 1935.60] white spots dark spots brown spots gray
[1933.00 - 1937.56] spots and I talk about it I have a whole
[1935.60 - 1938.64] chapter in it in brainsaver right here
[1937.56 - 1940.84] so if you guys want to know what book
[1938.64 - 1944.04] I'm in I'm in brainsaver make sure you
[1940.84 - 1945.96] get this book amazon.com us go to the
[1944.04 - 1947.52] library get it for free whatever but
[1945.96 - 1950.16] that's the book right there bring the
[1947.52 - 1952.04] information to your doctor ask your
[1950.16 - 1954.00] doctor if it's right for you take the
[1952.04 - 1955.60] book to your doctor show your doctor
[1954.00 - 1958.08] whatever you're looking at in here
[1955.60 - 1960.56] including the protocols but it's very in
[1958.08 - 1962.56] depth about toxic heavy metals
[1960.56 - 1966.04] extremely
[1962.56 - 1968.80] comprehensive really really
[1966.04 - 1971.48] comprehensive a lot of people have MSG
[1968.80 - 1971.48] deposits in their
[1972.20 - 1977.64] brain a lot of people have salt deposits
[1975.40 - 1980.36] in their brain you ready for this all
[1977.64 - 1983.12] that excess salt people are eating they
[1980.36 - 1985.20] eat so much salt a lot of the road salt
[1983.12 - 1986.88] they eat because they're at restaurants
[1985.20 - 1988.72] and they think it's a healthy meal and
[1986.88 - 1990.80] there's a lot of road salt meaning
[1988.72 - 1994.52] really cheap processed
[1990.80 - 1998.04] salt and even if you overdo it with like
[1994.52 - 2000.44] too much of the higher quality salts and
[1998.04 - 2002.04] you're overdoing it it's got to go
[2000.44 - 2005.32] somewhere you
[2002.04 - 2008.72] guys it can become like a salty soup
[2005.32 - 2010.40] inside your body and then your liver
[2008.72 - 2014.20] can't handle that much
[2010.40 - 2016.16] salt and yeah your bile can't handle
[2014.20 - 2017.92] that much salt your HCL can't handle
[2016.16 - 2019.88] that much salt you have so much salt in
[2017.92 - 2022.16] you this isn't like celery juice that's
[2019.88 - 2023.96] different that's an entirely different
[2022.16 - 2026.92] sodium right and then you got all this
[2023.96 - 2028.08] salt in you but high concentrations of
[2026.92 - 2030.32] it because you wouldn't believe how much
[2028.08 - 2032.08] salt you can throw on food it's insane
[2030.32 - 2035.68] how much salt you can just bury in food
[2032.08 - 2038.28] restaurant food they pack it in Salt
[2035.68 - 2039.76] right pizzas packed in salt took all the
[2038.28 - 2042.04] salt off the pizza you'd be like why am
[2039.76 - 2044.52] I eating this You' be like this is
[2042.04 - 2047.08] terrible that's how much salt is on a
[2044.52 - 2049.44] pizza so what happens is salt deposits
[2047.08 - 2050.40] grow and they collect inside the brain
[2049.44 - 2052.80] and they
[2050.40 - 2055.24] crystallize and crystallizations from
[2052.80 - 2056.64] salt deposits show up on the MRIs and
[2055.24 - 2057.80] they're like what is this they don't
[2056.64 - 2059.88] know and they're not going to cut your
[2057.80 - 2061.28] brain in half they're not going to say
[2059.88 - 2062.76] we're going to experiment and cut your
[2061.28 - 2064.52] brain in half and we're going to go try
[2062.76 - 2065.88] to find out what this is and they're not
[2064.52 - 2068.60] going to go and look for that salt
[2065.88 - 2071.28] deposit that MSG deposit salt deposit or
[2068.60 - 2073.44] that scar tissue or that
[2071.28 - 2076.88] calcification that's another thing too
[2073.44 - 2079.40] we're on such acidic diets that we lose
[2076.88 - 2083.24] so much calcium out of our bones the
[2079.40 - 2085.24] calcium ends up hoarding inside brain
[2083.24 - 2087.84] tissue and becomes
[2085.24 - 2089.04] calcifications and then we get an MRI
[2087.84 - 2094.28] when we're in our
[2089.04 - 2095.72] 50s 40s or 6s and on the MRI there's
[2094.28 - 2097.04] this calcification they don't even know
[2095.72 - 2098.96] what it is they're like we don't know
[2097.04 - 2101.24] what this is Mr
[2098.96 - 2103.92] Jones and you have this calcification
[2101.24 - 2106.16] that's in the brain it's a
[2103.92 - 2108.60] calcification it's
[2106.16 - 2111.04] calcium that had nowhere to go that
[2108.60 - 2114.32] leeched out of your bones that stored up
[2111.04 - 2116.76] in the brain tissue you can have you can
[2114.32 - 2120.44] be someone that has literally like it's
[2116.76 - 2122.24] it's a whole smor sporg of all these
[2120.44 - 2124.24] different spots in your brain from an
[2122.24 - 2125.76] MRI you can have brown spots in the
[2124.24 - 2127.32] crystallizations you could have white
[2125.76 - 2128.48] spots you could have what looks like
[2127.32 - 2130.84] Crystal
[2128.48 - 2132.60] you all this stuff and then lesions what
[2130.84 - 2137.16] looks like lesions dark spots black
[2132.60 - 2141.72] spots and it's like MSG deposit sodium
[2137.16 - 2145.08] deposit yeah calcification Scar Tissue
[2141.72 - 2147.52] Mercury and copper that's that's how
[2145.08 - 2150.72] crazy it is right
[2147.52 - 2153.56] there so we got these dead Metals we got
[2150.72 - 2155.80] these living Metals but there's a battle
[2153.56 - 2155.80] that
[2156.04 - 2161.12] happens yeah
[2159.00 - 2164.00] okay now if your brain is full of
[2161.12 - 2166.20] electrical currents what must be
[2164.00 - 2167.60] involved Metals that's right so good
[2166.20 - 2170.24] metals like I said they're part of the
[2167.60 - 2172.04] electrical currents but what happens is
[2170.24 - 2174.40] these good Metals include these
[2172.04 - 2179.00] beneficial non-industrialized forms of
[2174.40 - 2181.44] gold calcium copper calcium soft metal
[2179.00 - 2185.92] copper pottassium but the good stuff
[2181.44 - 2189.00] from our Foods magnesium chromium
[2185.92 - 2191.08] padium right and more one reason these
[2189.00 - 2192.96] beneficial metals are Theirs to control
[2191.08 - 2195.68] electrical currents so we have all these
[2192.96 - 2198.32] crazy minerals that are living metals
[2195.68 - 2201.16] that reside in our neurons inside our
[2198.32 - 2203.04] brain and they're there to protect us
[2201.16 - 2206.40] because that's how our electricity just
[2203.04 - 2208.96] swims along right it's incredible Rogue
[2206.40 - 2211.48] toxic heavy metals residing in our brain
[2208.96 - 2214.44] with the good Metals wreak havoc they
[2211.48 - 2216.64] create a battle in our brains and that
[2214.44 - 2220.08] battle can be like the battle we have in
[2216.64 - 2222.60] our mind I hate myself I don't trust
[2220.08 - 2225.76] myself you know I can't stop these
[2222.60 - 2227.76] impulsive actions I know I have good
[2225.76 - 2230.16] intentions but I'm suffering and people
[2227.76 - 2234.08] think I have bad intentions I got so
[2230.16 - 2236.00] much fear I can't get out I'm just lost
[2234.08 - 2238.24] I got sadness coming out from the pit of
[2236.00 - 2241.40] my gut and I don't know what it is or
[2238.24 - 2244.24] what why I'm so sad I don't do anything
[2241.40 - 2246.80] right I can't get anything
[2244.24 - 2249.52] done and it's just this battle in our
[2246.80 - 2252.20] brains right there it's good medals and
[2249.52 - 2256.44] bad metals and it's this battle that's
[2252.20 - 2259.08] happening from having this in our
[2256.44 - 2261.24] brain yeah which one of your books are
[2259.08 - 2263.48] you working with right now I think Mary
[2261.24 - 2266.04] said I'm working with brain saver right
[2263.48 - 2267.88] here okay I know I don't put there's no
[2266.04 - 2271.48] advertisers I didn't make any Advertiser
[2267.88 - 2273.80] deals on my podcast all the podcast
[2271.48 - 2275.52] Giants they all have advertisers right
[2273.80 - 2277.24] you guys they make deals so they can
[2275.52 - 2279.92] make like a million a year 5 million a
[2277.24 - 2281.68] year whatever it is I don't do that no
[2279.92 - 2284.28] advertisers on my podcast so I have to
[2281.68 - 2286.48] be my own Advertiser okay here you go
[2284.28 - 2289.32] you got the brain saver right
[2286.48 - 2292.12] there these are the toxic heavy metal
[2289.32 - 2295.76] books right here brain saver and the
[2292.12 - 2296.84] protocols books you should have these
[2295.76 - 2299.56] right
[2296.84 - 2303.12] here you should have
[2299.56 - 2306.84] these I just want you guys to get free
[2303.12 - 2310.24] clear podcast listening without a bunch
[2306.84 - 2312.72] of commercial on there I just that's how
[2310.24 - 2315.20] I feel okay by the way medical medum
[2312.72 - 2316.52] podcast at Apple podcast I just want to
[2315.20 - 2319.20] tell you there's a food poisoning
[2316.52 - 2322.68] episode on there underrated food
[2319.20 - 2324.56] poisoning is undercovered food poisoning
[2322.68 - 2327.68] under
[2324.56 - 2330.48] appreciated under respected food
[2327.68 - 2332.64] poisoning is under reported and
[2330.48 - 2334.12] underrated so what people don't realize
[2332.64 - 2336.12] with food poisoning is it's killing
[2334.12 - 2338.04] people every single day out there people
[2336.12 - 2339.36] aren't being worn
[2338.04 - 2341.72] they're not being warned they're not
[2339.36 - 2343.64] being educated about food poisoning it's
[2341.72 - 2346.00] like Russian Roulette out there it's
[2343.64 - 2349.56] like ticking time bombs out there people
[2346.00 - 2351.28] go into restaurants and yes they can die
[2349.56 - 2354.40] how many people have died from food
[2351.28 - 2356.72] poisoning a year a lot you couldn't even
[2354.40 - 2360.04] believe go listen to the episode

[2403.84 - 2408.20] residing in the brain with the good
[2405.84 - 2410.48] Metals wreak havoc they create a battle
[2408.20 - 2412.72] in our brains a battle in our mind I
[2410.48 - 2414.80] can't wait to read one thing to you
[2412.72 - 2417.48] living metal against dead metal check
[2414.80 - 2419.40] this out you guys lifegiving medal
[2417.48 - 2422.56] versus lifet taking
[2419.40 - 2425.96] medal isn't that sick isn't that sick
[2422.56 - 2429.24] it's a sick World lifegiving medal

[2472.32 - 2476.64] almost 10 years
[2473.52 - 2478.76] ago everybody brought it to their
[2476.64 - 2481.32] doctors it's all you would hear out

[2486.44 - 2492.72] was wrong with every body was incredible
[2488.84 - 2496.72] concussion though concussion is in brain
[2492.72 - 2499.12] saver that's the protocol is in here all
[2496.72 - 2502.56] right check this out you guys got a
[2499.12 - 2505.04] second listen to this living metal
[2502.56 - 2508.24] versus dead metal life-taking medal
[2505.04 - 2511.56] versus life-giving Medal
[2508.24 - 2514.00] okay good versus
[2511.56 - 2516.04] evil good versus evil isn't it
[2514.00 - 2518.48] interesting think about that right now
[2516.04 - 2520.28] okay think about that
[2518.48 - 2524.32] so I want to I want to do this for a
[2520.28 - 2529.36] second I want to make a new brain real
[2524.32 - 2533.96] quick can I do that can I make a new
[2529.36 - 2536.96] brain there's a new brain okay midline
[2533.96 - 2536.96] Canal
[2537.96 - 2543.72] squiggly new
[2540.72 - 2543.72] brain
[2544.24 - 2553.32] okay metal deposit metal
[2548.52 - 2557.04] deposit metal deposit metal deposit okay
[2553.32 - 2557.04] all right get
[2558.24 - 2562.68] ready good
[2560.20 - 2564.96] metals good metal
[2562.68 - 2567.36] deposits good Metals
[2564.96 - 2570.52] deposits good Metals
[2567.36 - 2573.52] deposits good
[2570.52 - 2573.52] Metals
[2573.88 - 2579.12] okay bad Metals ready
[2582.64 - 2587.44] evil
[2584.44 - 2587.44] ready
[2589.24 - 2593.08] good right
[2591.08 - 2597.00] there
[2593.08 - 2600.16] okay on a physical level there is good
[2597.00 - 2602.36] versus evil inside our
[2600.16 - 2604.84] brain you don't think that can play a
[2602.36 - 2604.84] role in
[2604.88 - 2612.36] anything it can play a massive role is
[2609.00 - 2614.72] it possible that when metals are so bad
[2612.36 - 2617.40] in somebody's brain they go and they
[2614.72 - 2622.84] stab 10
[2617.40 - 2625.72] people is it possible metals are so off
[2622.84 - 2629.56] putting in a bad way in somebody's
[2625.72 - 2632.52] brain where they do something that they
[2629.56 - 2638.60] no one thought they would ever
[2632.52 - 2640.00] do is it possible that metals
[2638.60 - 2642.76] in somebody's
[2640.00 - 2645.44] brain right the good and evil battle
[2642.76 - 2647.44] that's happening can get somebody to
[2645.44 - 2649.68] hate
[2647.44 - 2655.76] themselves
[2649.68 - 2660.12] terribly H despise themselves yes
[2655.76 - 2663.52] definitely because what you have is good
[2660.12 - 2666.52] versus evil industrialized
[2663.52 - 2667.56] Metals right here Mercury aluminum
[2666.52 - 2669.20] copper
[2667.56 - 2670.80] that got into us through all kinds of
[2669.20 - 2674.76] different Avenues including Pharm
[2670.80 - 2679.16] pharmaceutical exposure to our waterways
[2674.76 - 2679.16] to the trails falling out of the
[2679.20 - 2685.48] sky
[2681.36 - 2688.96] evil and then good Metals trace minerals
[2685.48 - 2692.92] from our foods from celery juice from
[2688.96 - 2694.56] the heavy metal detox trace minerals and
[2692.92 - 2698.32] our food that we
[2694.56 - 2702.00] eat right there
[2698.32 - 2704.92] Encompass good and then Mercury
[2702.00 - 2707.76] aluminum cadmium lead copper
[2704.92 - 2709.68] industrialized that got into our body in
[2707.76 - 2713.24] ways that it's not supposed to but it
[2709.68 - 2716.00] did and it got in here
[2713.24 - 2720.16] evil short circuits neurons and you got
[2716.00 - 2724.08] OCD OCD can create
[2720.16 - 2727.48] thoughts that don't stop making somebody
[2724.08 - 2730.68] literally suffer a terrifying suffer
[2727.48 - 2731.80] u a suffering people can't explain or
[2730.68 - 2733.76] understand unless they've gone through
[2731.80 - 2735.96] it themselves with OCD alone and then
[2733.76 - 2738.52] same thing with bipolar being like okay
[2735.96 - 2743.20] for one minute and then feeling so lost
[2738.52 - 2747.12] and sick and feeling so like so sick in
[2743.20 - 2749.32] their body the feeling of being so ill
[2747.12 - 2753.24] and then feeling better for a minute and
[2749.32 - 2755.40] then not feeling better and then
[2753.24 - 2758.16] depression anxiety
[2755.40 - 2760.60] attacks because that industrialized
[2758.16 - 2763.24] metal right there am I yelling loud
[2760.60 - 2765.80] enough that industrialized metal right
[2763.24 - 2768.20] there is causing
[2765.80 - 2772.68] pain and that's the
[2768.20 - 2774.60] evil yep the Mercury demon and so forth
[2772.68 - 2778.56] and then the good is the minerals we got
[2774.60 - 2781.64] to get inside our brain to sustain us
[2778.56 - 2785.44] and someday override so that the Battle
[2781.64 - 2788.12] of evil and good is not so much of a
[2785.44 - 2790.48] thing where it's less and less and this
[2788.12 - 2794.40] battle is not
[2790.48 - 2796.84] so massive it becomes a little battle
[2794.40 - 2799.80] instead and a little battle because the
[2796.84 - 2800.52] more good minerals you have right here
[2799.80 - 2803.76] the
[2800.52 - 2803.76] battle you
[2804.48 - 2809.56] win Terry Johnson dead medals would be a
[2807.48 - 2811.64] great name for a rock
[2809.56 - 2813.76] band it
[2811.64 - 2815.84] would I wouldn't doubt it if there
[2813.76 - 2817.36] wasn't one out there at some point in
[2815.84 - 2818.40] time
[2817.36 - 2821.56] throughout our history I know the
[2818.40 - 2823.08] Grateful Dead is one that uses the dead
[2821.56 - 2824.68] and I know there's a lot of metal bands
[2823.08 - 2827.88] out
[2824.68 - 2831.56] there okay so check this
[2827.88 - 2834.04] out it's a physical battle going on
[2831.56 - 2836.04] inside our brain on top of the battle of
[2834.04 - 2839.76] Life on this planet it's the problem
[2836.04 - 2841.92] that was never meant to be here was what
[2839.76 - 2844.56] you see right here this battle right
[2841.92 - 2846.56] here was never meant to be here on
[2844.56 - 2847.60] planet Earth is it somewhere else on
[2846.56 - 2850.20] another
[2847.60 - 2852.60] planet is there another planet out there
[2850.20 - 2854.52] where there's a
[2852.60 - 2857.88] humanoid
[2854.52 - 2859.84] species civilization on another planet
[2857.88 - 2862.96] out there in the
[2859.84 - 2865.12] galaxy in the universe or in some Galaxy
[2862.96 - 2869.04] in some solar system is there another
[2865.12 - 2872.24] planet that's harboring a species of
[2869.04 - 2874.68] people are they battling the same thing
[2872.24 - 2877.12] is evil on their Planet making sure
[2874.68 - 2880.56] Metals get into everything from children
[2877.12 - 2884.08] to everyone to women is there an evil
[2880.56 - 2886.52] evil doer Force hierarchy illumination
[2884.08 - 2889.04] somewhere on another planet doing this
[2886.52 - 2892.32] to those people and those humanoids
[2889.04 - 2894.40] versus here or is it just here it's
[2892.32 - 2896.32] question I've asked Spirit of compassion
[2894.40 - 2898.92] and I do have the
[2896.32 - 2903.00] answer over there on
[2898.92 - 2905.68] IG lady bear says is there any way to
[2903.00 - 2907.96] test to see how much of good medals and
[2905.68 - 2909.08] bad Metals metals we have the problem is
[2907.96 - 2912.28] with
[2909.08 - 2913.88] that okay is that everybody has
[2912.28 - 2915.48] exposures every single day so when they
[2913.88 - 2917.44] take blood from you they're getting that
[2915.48 - 2919.96] new
[2917.44 - 2922.68] exposure metal deposits can stay in your
[2919.96 - 2924.96] brain and very little ever be in the
[2922.68 - 2926.88] bloodstream metal deposits can stay in
[2924.96 - 2930.44] your liver and very little be in your
[2926.88 - 2933.00] bloodstream testing is never accurate
[2930.44 - 2935.52] when it comes down to chronic illness
[2933.00 - 2937.76] derived from toxic heavy metals so guess
[2935.52 - 2939.72] what is accurate though
[2937.76 - 2941.76] guess what the accurate thing is Guess
[2939.72 - 2945.36] How guess what the best test there ever
[2941.76 - 2948.16] was and ever will be it's when something
[2945.36 - 2949.84] works but I mean Works You've Been
[2948.16 - 2951.16] Everywhere you tried everything you've
[2949.84 - 2953.40] done
[2951.16 - 2954.72] everything you learn you got metals
[2953.40 - 2956.76] because you're learning this information
[2954.72 - 2959.24] of what creates your symptoms conditions
[2956.76 - 2962.36] and then you use the heavy metal
[2959.24 - 2965.08] detox three out of the five ingredients
[2962.36 - 2966.48] minimum or five of the ingredients five
[2965.08 - 2971.04] out of the five ingredients of the heavy
[2966.48 - 2974.40] metal detox right here out of this
[2971.04 - 2976.52] book and in these books that heavy metal
[2974.40 - 2978.52] detox you use and you watch your
[2976.52 - 2980.80] problems go away and as your problems go
[2978.52 - 2983.44] away that is right there that's how we
[2980.80 - 2985.92] do it we do it where you're riding your
[2983.44 - 2987.88] problems that is the example that is the
[2985.92 - 2990.16] street cred That's The credibility where
[2987.88 - 2992.40] the problem goes because sure you can
[2990.16 - 2993.80] get your your different tests and hey
[2992.40 - 2996.00] you might have medals you might not have
[2993.80 - 2997.76] Metals but are you getting better what
[2996.00 - 2999.56] are you doing get better and when you
[2997.76 - 3001.80] use something that works and it makes it
[2999.56 - 3003.80] go away that's the ultimate test because
[3001.80 - 3005.64] we're exposed to every day they can't
[3003.80 - 3008.76] test organs they can't cut open your
[3005.64 - 3010.92] liver and dig out the metal and say oh
[3008.76 - 3012.88] you got this much metal in your liver it
[3010.92 - 3015.60] stays embedded in there and then your
[3012.88 - 3017.60] bloodstream can be somewhat
[3015.60 - 3019.28] clean where the metals aren't really
[3017.60 - 3021.04] floating around but your liver's
[3019.28 - 3023.24] compacted in metal because it's your
[3021.04 - 3025.64] filter it's holding the metal down in
[3023.24 - 3027.44] there it is your
[3025.64 - 3029.64] filter
[3027.44 - 3031.40] we can't just test an organ and cut the
[3029.64 - 3032.96] darn thing open I've said this for
[3031.40 - 3034.72] decades they're just now starting to
[3032.96 - 3036.64] share that information the medical me
[3034.72 - 3039.52] information they've taken it poached it
[3036.64 - 3042.04] and now guess what so-called brand new
[3039.52 - 3044.96] metal experts in the last year in the
[3042.04 - 3047.44] last 6 months one even running ads 247
[3044.96 - 3049.68] to the medical meme Community is stolen
[3047.44 - 3052.16] medical meme information yeah totally
[3049.68 - 3054.68] taken it and there L like you you can't
[3052.16 - 3055.96] test for Metals in the blood it's
[3054.68 - 3057.72] interesting cuz you weren't saying that
[3055.96 - 3059.52] a few years ago ago in anything you were
[3057.72 - 3060.96] doing and you weren't saying that 5
[3059.52 - 3062.52] years ago in anything you were doing
[3060.96 - 3064.40] interesting but you're saying it now in
[3062.52 - 3066.48] the last 6 months for the first time
[3064.40 - 3068.24] ever in your career and they're like
[3066.48 - 3070.08] yeah you can't test for Metals in the
[3068.24 - 3071.88] blood cuz they're in the organs that was
[3070.08 - 3074.28] just poached recently and then it's
[3071.88 - 3077.32] being like slammed at the medical me
[3074.28 - 3077.32] Community every single day in
[3078.60 - 3085.64] ads yep your lab test will not be able
[3082.88 - 3087.48] to determine if you have high medals
[3085.64 - 3089.20] because they're in the organs in the
[3087.48 - 3092.04] brain that's medical medium information
[3089.20 - 3093.84] right there and so to answer that
[3092.04 - 3096.64] question no it's not easy but you know
[3093.84 - 3100.00] how you know you got Metals is when you
[3096.64 - 3102.68] actually do something for those Metals
[3100.00 - 3104.76] longterm or even shortterm like the
[3102.68 - 3106.68] heavy metal detox the medical meme heavy
[3104.76 - 3108.80] metal detox and you're watching these
[3106.68 - 3110.56] symptoms dissipate and go away and
[3108.80 - 3112.92] that's right because your metals are
[3110.56 - 3115.52] going away whoa you're coming from

[3320.36 - 3325.36] information good versus evil dead medals
[3323.44 - 3328.36] against living medals right residing in
[3325.36 - 3331.56] our brain neurons that get contaminated
[3328.36 - 3334.84] they they leech they outp poet they
[3331.56 - 3336.88] become a problem electrical impulses
[3334.84 - 3338.88] that swim through the brain so
[3336.88 - 3341.88] electrical impulses that go through the
[3338.88 - 3344.84] brain right an electrical impulse goes
[3341.88 - 3349.40] through and it hits one of these
[3344.84 - 3352.16] deposits it blows up it it it um it
[3349.40 - 3354.88] causes a problem where boom now we're in
[3352.16 - 3356.76] some OCD we're in some kind of emotional
[3354.88 - 3359.52] turmoil we're feeling
[3356.76 - 3361.84] sensation we're dealing with a struggle
[3359.52 - 3364.08] we're dealing with ticks and
[3361.84 - 3367.84] spasms yeah you can even have ticks and
[3364.08 - 3369.12] spasms Tremors people get Parkinson's
[3367.84 - 3370.92] there's so many different varieties of
[3369.12 - 3373.08] Parkinson's happening where people get
[3370.92 - 3376.72] all these different kinds of conditions
[3373.08 - 3379.76] with um jerking and and all of that and
[3376.72 - 3382.24] and Tremors and Shakes and shakes toxic
[3379.76 - 3384.44] heavy metals we got to get them out so
[3382.24 - 3385.96] the neurons can restore and here's what
[3384.44 - 3387.88] I love about the Heavy Metal the medical
[3385.96 - 3391.08] meme metal detox I just want to tell you
[3387.88 - 3393.68] guys here's what I love about it it's
[3391.08 - 3395.92] restoring while it's getting Metals out
[3393.68 - 3400.16] while it's removing Metals it's
[3395.92 - 3403.88] restoring tissue it's restoring brain
[3400.16 - 3407.00] tissue it's putting more back in more of
[3403.88 - 3410.88] the good stuff back in it's actually not
[3407.00 - 3413.20] just cleaning up and cleaning out but
[3410.88 - 3415.32] it's restoring and putting back in
[3413.20 - 3417.00] that's what has to happen that's why
[3415.32 - 3419.52] people heal
[3417.00 - 3422.20] metals have to come out but everything
[3419.52 - 3424.00] has to be restored at the same time
[3422.20 - 3425.64] right so that's why it's so incredible
[3424.00 - 3427.80] that's why the five ingredients in the
[3425.64 - 3429.12] heavy metal detox are so powerful and
[3427.80 - 3430.52] you can check them out in the medical
[3429.12 - 3434.04] medium books
[3430.52 - 3437.00] right it's it's so powerful because it's
[3434.04 - 3440.24] restoring tissue as it's
[3437.00 - 3442.96] removing and guess
[3440.24 - 3444.76] what the heavy metal detox is the
[3442.96 - 3446.92] ultimate
[3444.76 - 3449.20] binder the ultim
[3446.92 - 3451.04] binder it's got the wild blueberry in
[3449.20 - 3453.40] there and nobody even talked about the
[3451.04 - 3454.40] wild blueberry nobody even talked about
[3453.40 - 3456.76] the wild
[3454.40 - 3459.00] blueberry nobody
[3456.76 - 3461.40] did it wasn't on the
[3459.00 - 3462.92] scene medical medium information had to
[3461.40 - 3464.76] make sure people knew that the wild
[3462.92 - 3466.32] blueberry was that powerful and part of
[3464.76 - 3468.84] it's part of the heavy metal detox and
[3466.32 - 3469.72] it's the ultimate binder and that's part
[3468.84 - 3472.84] of
[3469.72 - 3475.96] it but if you can only do four out of
[3472.84 - 3479.00] the five you can only do three out of
[3475.96 - 3481.20] the five you're doing something if you
[3479.00 - 3484.76] can only do the spirulina the barley
[3481.20 - 3484.76] grass cheese powder and the
[3485.36 - 3491.52] douls if you can only do the cilantro
[3488.20 - 3493.60] the sparina and the wild
[3491.52 - 3496.12] blueberry if you can only do the barley
[3493.60 - 3498.32] grass cheese powder the cilantro and the
[3496.12 - 3500.60] douls Whatever It Is three out of the
