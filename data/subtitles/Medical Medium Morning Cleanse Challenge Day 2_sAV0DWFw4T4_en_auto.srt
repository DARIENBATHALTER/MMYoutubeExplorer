00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,800
sick

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
we walk around we don't know about it we

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
don't understand

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,719
we our liver needs a routine and it has

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
a routine but we

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
break its routine and then we break its

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
routine

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,680
and then we break its routine and that's

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
what we do and that's what happens to

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,840
our liver is we

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
break its routine all the time and then

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
we also

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
we also do a lot of stuff to our liver

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,840
that we don't know about we're eating

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
those hot dogs we're eating those

32
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,960
cheeseburgers

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
we're eating the bacon you know and even

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,000
if we're eating too many nut butters if

35
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,000
you're eating too many nut butters if

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
you're eating all that coconut oil

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,439
if you're doing like two tablespoons of

38
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
coconut oil because somebody told you it

39
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119
was a good idea

40
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
and then what happens is that that

41
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
you're doing all that coconut oil and

42
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,159
then boom your liver is paying the price

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
for it nobody realizes it even though

44
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,600
coconut oil is

45
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,040
seemingly healthy right but we we end up

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,400
we end up um really burdening our liver

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
more and more

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
even though it's already burdened it's

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
already under pressure it's already

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,479
stagnant it's already sluggish

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
and the medical media morning cleanse is

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,240
to save it's really to help save our

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
liver at the same time but who cares

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,840
about the liver who cares i mean

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,159
you don't see it we don't feel it no one

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,360
cares about it so why should we really

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
care about our liver well

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200

right there

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
the minute the weight gain starts

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
happening you start putting on

62
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
unwanted pounds you know you start

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
putting on those unwanted

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
ounces and they add up and they add up

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
and they add

66
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
up and then you know we get in trouble

16 to 32 ounces of lemon water in the

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
morning when you wake up

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
because your liver has this routine and

172
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,639
we

173
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,080
break that liver's routine i'll talk

174
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
about how

175
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
so that's the water right here so what

176
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,440
happens is that

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,800
our liver has to work all night long to

178
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
keep our blood

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,400
clean so we walk around with dirty blood

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,080
all the time and i talk about that in

181
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
the past and you know what happens is

182
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
when we walk around with dirty blood we

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
end up getting dehydrated the toxins

184
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,880
build up in our system

185
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
they go back into our liver they get

186
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
sucked back into our liver

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,400
over and over again and our liver has

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,039
this routine throughout the night

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,120
which is really early morning where it

190
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,199
likes to package up all those toxins the

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
petrochemicals the plastics

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
um colognes perfumes that we might

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,479
breathe in they get trapped in the liver

194
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,560
air fresheners

195
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
uh scented candles they get trapped in

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,919
the liver all that gets in there

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
and our our liver wants to get it out

198
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
and then

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
gasoline at the pump at the gas station

200
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
we're breathing in the fumes that goes

201
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,360
inside our liver

202
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,360
antibiotics we might have taken years

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,800
ago maybe even recently

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,759
go inside our liver antidepressants

205
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,680
anti-inflammatories cold medicines all

206
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
go inside her liver thyroid medications

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
outside of liver

208
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,479
and you know so what happens is it all

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
adds up

210
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,039
and it adds up and then the toxic heavy

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,639
metals pesticides herbicides fungicides

212
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,440
rodenticides and insecticides all of it

213
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,440
um add up and they're built and they all

214
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,120
store up and store up inside the liver

215
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
the liver has this routine of wanting to

216
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
get rid of this stuff if you hear

217
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,520
somebody say

218
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,360
you don't need a cleanse you don't need

219
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
to worry about any cleansing there's no

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
reason to cleanse

221
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,759
who can you know your body does it

222
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
naturally just eat good

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,360
just eat a balanced diet just eat

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,080
healthy enough

225
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
you know just do that and your body will

226
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
cleanse fine

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
just so you know you're getting taken

228
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,680
down the wrong road

229
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,680
um that information is really just

230
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
it it's not gonna help anyone really

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,919
it's gonna set people back if anything

232
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,240
our bodies do need a cleanse because

233
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,319
we're up against so much and then

234
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,319
we're up against all the high fat diets

235
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
so a lot of people eat a lot of chicken

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
they

237
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
eat a lot of beef they eat a lot of

238
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,520
bacon they eat a lot of eggs

239
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,759
cheese milk butter nut butters

240
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,080
even avocado people i've i got a friend

241
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
who eats like 10 avocados a day

242
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,759
and it's just basically like eating

243
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,840
sticks of butter every day right and

244
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
okay sure avocados are a healthier fat

245
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
but the liver

246
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,360
still needs to cleanse and when we fill

247
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
our bloodstream up with fat all the time

248
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,319
our liver can't cleanse

249
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,719
so the goal is to

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
the goal is to actually give it a break

251
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
like allow it to do

252
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
its routine and not break that routine

253
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,839
so

254
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,760
when morning comes early morning comes

255
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,360
your liver's getting ready to pack up

256
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,839
all those poisons and toxins and get

257
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
them out

258
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,120
so you do 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water

259
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
to

260
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
flush that out out help it flush it out

261
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
of the bloodstream help it flush it out

262
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
push it out of the liver

263
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
and get it out of the body and that's

264
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
what you want to do in the morning

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,760
that's the goal

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
that's the key you're assisting your

267
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
liver

268
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
to actually cleanse and detox and that's

269
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,000
what you're doing

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,480
so with that said we usually

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
break that by we put we end up eating

272
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
some butter

273
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
we end up eating some nut butters in the

274
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
morning we put peanut butter in our

275
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
smoothies we put coconut oil in our

276
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
smoothies

277
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
and hey maybe we just do eggs in the

278
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,040
morning maybe we do bacon in the morning

279
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
whatever it is

280
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,519
whatever it is before noon when you have

281
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
those fats before noon those radical

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
fats i call them

283
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
when you have those radical fats before

284
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,800
noon

285
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,080
your liver shuts down boom it's just

286
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
shuts down

287
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
and it can't do what it's got to do

288
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
that's it meaning it can't get the stuff

289
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
out

290
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
and then the toxins float around in your

291
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
bloodstream float around in your

292
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
bloodstream and float around in your

293
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
bloodstream

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,600
and as they float around in your

295
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,360
bloodstream they actually get

296
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
caught up and they get stagnant in there

297
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
and they end up

298
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
they end up back into the liver is what

299
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
they end up

300
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,680
they end up back in and then we get in

301
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
trouble

302
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,800
so the point is is we want to make sure

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
the lemon water is there for you

304
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
first thing in the morning so that's the

305
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
first thing we're going to make some

306
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,279
celery juice that's the next part

307
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,360
you got to wait 15 to 30 minutes minimum

308
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,040
15 minutes to 30 minutes

309
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
before you have your celery juice we're

310
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,720
going into that right now i'm gonna

311
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,760

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,279
up here this is the next part of the

313
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
morning plants remember we're on day two

314
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,800
of the

315
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,800
day morning cleanse challenge um if you

316
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,560

317
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,560
want to get a copy of cleanse to heal

318
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:12,160
[Music]

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160

is just right up against the mic

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,880
and i think that's what's happening

329
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
still vibrating though

330
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,639

332
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,320
better okay great

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,320
so the juicer was covering the sound

334
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,720
[Music]

335
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,760
[Applause]

336
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,519

337
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,519

everybody's happy

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,160
so are you guys doing the medical

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
meeting warning plans

342
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,079
it's a great way to really protect

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
yourself during the holiday

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,560
a lot of people have strokes heart

345
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,839
attacks during the holiday

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,800
and talking to a doctor and he said if

347
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,399
only

348
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,720
people were doing the medical medium

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,839
morning cleanse during the holidays

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
it would have prevented a lot of heart

351
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
attacks

352
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,680
a lot of people are on lots of salt and

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
fat in their diet

354
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,600
their blood gets really thick they get

355
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,600
dehydrated during the holiday

356
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,160
they're under stress and pressure right

357
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,200
and then it's just that perfect time for

358
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,200
boom a heart attack

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,760
and the hospitals talking to

360
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,360
an emergency room doctor friend of mine

361
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,519
and he said right now a lot of people

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
are coming in with fake heart attacks

363
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,880
they're coming in with real heart

364
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
attacks they're coming in with anxiety

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,240
attacks

366
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
panic attacks into the emergency room

367
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
some are real heart attacks some are

368
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,800
just

369
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
basically big big old panic attacks

370
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
which they call

371
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,480
fake heart attacks and it's it happens

372
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
at this time of year

373
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
and i like to think about this as being

374
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,399
a preventative

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,519
for a lot of people because when you're

376
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
doing your celery to

377
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
16 to 32 ounces of celery juice and

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,199
you're doing that

379
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,680
and you're doing your 16 to 30 ounces of

380
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,320
lemon water and you're doing the liver

381
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,240
rescue smoothie or the medical medium

382
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
heavy metal detox smoothie right

383
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
you're you're preventing all kinds of

384
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,000
calamity total

385
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,600
adversity and all kinds of problems so

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
it's really a helpful situation

387
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
so right now i'm juicing always know

388
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,560
that with this juicer you're always

389
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
going to use less celery

390
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,040
all celery changes as far as how much

391
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
juice i'm using two kinds of celery

392
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
right now

393
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
from two different batches couple of

394
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
sticks are juicier some sticks have no

395
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
juice in them

396
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
and it's not about how many sticks you

397
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,920
put in the machine

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,279
it's about how dry the pulp comes out if

399
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,160
that pulp comes out

400
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,320
bone dry like in this machine here then

401
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
guess what you get all the juice

402
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
and that's the key right there that's

403
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,079
the key and that means

404
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,320
out of any other juicer this juicer will

405
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,800
actually cut your celery costs in half

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,800
because you're getting every drop out

407
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,480
[Applause]

408
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,320
i think you guys know the model i've

409
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,240
talked about it so many times

410
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,240
um but i know that that might not matter

411
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
so michelle crane's asking how much

412
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,240
celery are you using

413
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,360
to get how much juice i mean

414
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,240
some bunches of celery have are very

415
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,079
juicy so with this machine you'll only

416
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,440
need like five or six sticks

417
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,360
seven sticks some are really not juicy

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,560
this is not a bat this is not a juicy

419
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
batch this is a really

420
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,920
skinny celery stick so i'm using about

421
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,600
for these 32 ounces of juice

422
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,920
i'm using one bunch of celery

423
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,399
actually probably a little less maybe a

424
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,399
little less

425
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,000
but um so

426
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
celery juice is

427
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
it's like a little a little miracle is

428
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,199
what it is

429
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
it's changing people's lives i love it

430
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,600
in the medical media morning cleanse

431
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
what it does it's just extraordinary so

432
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
i just used some celery right here and

433
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,600
what you'll see

434
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
is this pulp is bone dry it's a little

435
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,920
piece of pulp right here

436
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
that that is i've used so many juicers

437
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
this is just incredible

438
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,920
by the way for all this juice it's

439
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
really incredible

440
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
um

441
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,839
i'm gonna pour the celery juice down

442
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,680
there we go and there's still more

443
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,680
uh in the container

444
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,600
so i got the 16 to 32 ounces well this

445
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
is this is 32 ounces roughly

446
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
of the celery juice that's the second

447
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,800
part of the second step in the medical

448
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,040
meeting morning cleanse

449
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,720
really important to do if you don't have

450
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,440
celery you can't do celery

451
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,279
look do aloe water do the medical medium

452
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
aloe water do the medical medium ginger

453
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,759
water if you want these are different

454
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,839
options right there

455
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:12,000
that you can do so um but

456
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,839
right here i'm about to do the next step

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,439
and we're going into the liver rescue

458
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
smoothie is where we're heading into now

459
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,360
you guys

460
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,799
so i'm excited um so like i said 16 to

461
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,799
32 ounces of

462
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
lime water i got today you could do

463
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,640
lemon water

464
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
which is great 16 to 30 ounces of celery

465
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,400
juice i have right there too remember 15

466
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,679
to 30 minutes is what you want to wait

467
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
before you do your cellar juice after

468
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
your lemon water

469
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
and then you want to wait a little while

470
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,520
after your celery juice too so that's

471
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
what we want to do

472
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,640
so i'm going to move things around i'm

473
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,240
going to move the juicer out of the way

474
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
so that's where i'm going next okay

475
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
bear with me you guys

476
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,840
just gonna get this out of the way here

477
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,520
so i got the blender in front of me i'm

478
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,640
going to make the liver rescue smoothie

479
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,640
is what i'm doing next

480
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
know i love preventative but real

481
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
preventative stuff

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
not stuff like not stupid talk

483
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,520
preventative like

484
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,480
where someone says this supplements uh

485
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
scientifically

486
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,600
you know there's a scientific study that

487
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
vitamin a

488
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,520
could help prevent an eye problem or

489
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,520
something like that great

490
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,559
that's really not real preventative to

491
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,120
begin with

492
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,520
that's not like real serious move the

493
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,080
needle preventative like preventing

494
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,200
disease preventing heart attacks

495
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,280
preventing

496
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
chronic fatigue syndrome like really

497
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,880
understanding what causes illness and

498
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,799
really preventing because that's what

499
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
medical medium information is about

500
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,799
when you're doing medical medium

501
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,400
information like in cleanse to heal

502
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
you're doing what you're really doing is

503
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,039
you're really protecting yourself

504
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,720
and from from problems you don't even

505
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,240
know could even have been coming and it

506
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,080
happens to people all the time

507
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
they live their life then now they have

508
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
thyroid disease then they live their

509
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,520
life and now they have something else

510
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
and

511
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,679
and when you're doing some of these

512
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
things you're preventing that for the

513
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,840
future and if you have problems you're

514
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,120
reversing that and that's the key

515
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,919
so i'm in um medical medium plans to

516
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
heal

517
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,360

natural health like oh bananas

617

know what causes illness

619
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,960
it's incredible that everybody can be

620
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
such an expert when they don't know why

621
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
anybody's sick

622
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,720
isn't that amazing medical medium

623
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
information changed the roles in chronic

624
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,679
illness because we had

625
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,080
we got answers for the first time in

626
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,760
history about why people are sick with

627
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,799
chronic illness isn't that unbelievable

628
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,520
how it works

629
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,679
and it had to come from above it's like

630
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
science of research for some reason just

631
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,960
can't find out why anybody's sick and

632
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
everybody's rolling around sick out

633
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
there

634
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,799
so i had to get the answers from bub

635
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
since i was a child i put it in the

636
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
books and people's lives are being saved

637
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,679
and

638
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,600
i love when people out there they'll rip

639
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,360
apart a banana or they'll rip apart

640
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
something and they don't even know why

641
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
everybody has lupus

642
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,440
they don't know why people have multiple

643
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
sclerosis they don't know why anybody

644
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,039
has eczema

645
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,480
and if they do spout out something it

646
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,240
comes from medical medium published

647
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
information they'll say oh it's the

648
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,360
liver now a god x mug that's funny

649
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
because

650
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,440
the only place that ever came from was

651
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,360
medical medium published information so

652
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,960
it's you know that will happen out there

653
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
because because all millions of books

654
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
got out there in the world but

655
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,000
when nobody knows why anybody got sick

656
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
or gets sick

657
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,760
and they're suffering and struggling

658
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,320
it's funny how they could be experts and

659
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,279
maybe tear down a banana or rip apart

660
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
something else it's

661
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,640
really kind of if you really think about

662
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
it it's just

663
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
yeah you're right michelle they'll just

664
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
say it's genetic that's not an answer oh

665
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,679
so our genes all went bad in the last 20

666
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
years

667
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
chronic illness is literally exploding

668
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
and our genes seem to all go bad in the

669
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,520
last 20 years

670
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,600
after thousands of years it just all

671
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,320
went bad interesting right

672
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,200
so yeah so anyway i just put the bananas

673
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,360
in here

674
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,120

so you put a couple of oats in here okay

808
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,360
it's about a cup a little bit more than

809
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,360
a cup that time

810
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,480

811
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,760

right here so

816
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,840
depending on how much cinnamon you like

817
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
some people don't like a lot of it some

818
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,440
people like a little bit of it

819
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,799
you know i mean half a teaspoon is what

820
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,480
i do usually

821
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,480
you know i've measured it a lot so half

822
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,360
teaspoon is really it's just

823
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
about four taps for me so i just put the

824
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,320
cinnamon in there i don't know if you

825
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,399

right so i put the cinnamon in there

828
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,600
gonna mix it up

829
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,519

830
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,480
using metal utensils if you're gonna do

831
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,080
any cooking

832
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,600
because your metal utensil is just going

833
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240

834
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,519

836
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,880
cover it and get it to a simmer

837
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,039

now you can have the maple syrup you

842
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,600

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,920
blueberry wild blueberries on top

932
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,240
you can mix it in right in here too so

933
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,640
you can do that you can i'll do you know

934
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,599
maybe in on ig i'll do a different

935
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,400
option

936
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,079
but you can add them in the oatmeal

937
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,079
right here so i got some

938
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,400
frozen wild blueberries and i'm putting

939
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,400
them in

940
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,079
right here

941
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,680
and you could mix it in here a little

942
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,240
bit

943
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,240
like that

944
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,200
sometimes i like just also putting them

945
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,520
right on top

946
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
so i'll do either or but this is just

947
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,599
looking so good this is the wild

948
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,839
blueberry

949
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,839
oatmeal right here the porridge

950
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,839
so they're mixed in there

951
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,920
moving this over

952
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,560
okay and then i'm gonna actually put a

953
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,839
few more wild blueberries right on top

954
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,839
is what i'm gonna do

955
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,720
so there it is there's the oatmeal

956
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,000
then of course i have the maple syrup

957
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
right here now i'm going to put a little

958
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,359
maple syrup on top

959
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,079
now you can do it to taste so i'm

960
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,040
putting a little bit on there

961
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,960
maybe i'm putting a little bit more

962
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,640
can't help it

963
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,160
so that's the wild blueberry

964
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,800
porridge and um

965
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,240
it's steaming hot the oatmeal trisha

966
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,599
marie says it's beautiful

967
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,119
yay amazing and

968
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,960
but it's really incredible i mean

969
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,640
honestly it's just incredible you got a

970
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,320
little bit of the cinnamon in there

971
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
you got the frozen wild blueberries that

972
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,359
were mixed in there

973
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,280
and then you got some wild blueberries

974
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,680
put on top that's how i like to do it

975
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
right

976
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,359
and then you put a little maple syrup on

977
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,800
top you can do this with millet too

978
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,480
that's the other option you don't have

979
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,359
to use oatmeal

980
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,079
for you know but for the most healing in

981
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,760
the medical medium morning cleanse

982
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,119
try to even just do fruit up until noon

983
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,640
you know you do the

984
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,400
lemon water right here 16 to 32 ounces

985
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,640
first thing in the morning upon waking

986
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,000
flush that liver is what you want to do

987
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,359
okay and then 15 to 30 minutes later you

988
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,520
do the celery juice

989
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
right after that okay 15 to 30 minutes

990
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,119
later minimum

991
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,320
you do the celery juice 16 to 32 ounces

992
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
of celery juice

993
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,400

994
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,680
already happening inside your body

995
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,480
with that alone 15 to 30 minutes later

996
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,000

then you know you do some fruit that's

1006
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,079
the most powerful way of doing you could

1007

do a fruit bowl you can chop

1008
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,000
