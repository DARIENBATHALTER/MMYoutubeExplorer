[0.08 - 3.84] strong i'm cooking
[2.24 - 6.32] healing broth which i'm excited about i
[3.84 - 8.56] got the water on right now
[6.32 - 11.68] got my time right here because guess
[8.56 - 14.48] what everybody is coughing their brains
[11.68 - 16.00] out right now everybody out there i mean
[14.48 - 17.68] if it hasn't hit you yet or hit your
[16.00 - 20.24] area yet just you know i mean i don't
[17.68 - 21.84] know what to say but it's like it's
[20.24 - 23.68] everybody's getting the sniffles the
[21.84 - 24.80] coughs and all that the fever everything
[23.68 - 26.80] else so
[24.80 - 29.36] the stuff is running through everybody
[26.80 - 32.08] it's everywhere so what do we do to stay
[29.36 - 34.88] strong because what happens is that
[32.08 - 36.24] it's the bugs that go around
[34.88 - 39.60] knock
[36.24 - 41.20] everyone's immune system down
[39.60 - 43.20] and then
[41.20 - 46.08] you can't get back off the ground
[43.20 - 49.84] because something else inside of you
[46.08 - 51.44] is creeping up even if you don't hear it
[49.84 - 54.00] because it makes no sense you know the
[51.44 - 55.60] funny thing is is that
[54.00 - 57.12] people walk around people walk right now
[55.60 - 58.80] it's no big deal it's good good you can
[57.12 - 61.04] get over a cold get over a cold whatever
[58.80 - 62.48] but for a lot of people it knocks them
[61.04 - 64.40] down
[62.48 - 68.32] so then something else creeps up like
[64.40 - 70.80] epstein barr and shingles and all these
[68.32 - 72.80] other things and they're fever blisters
[70.80 - 75.52] and also now they got neurological
[72.80 - 77.92] fatigue and everything because the body
[75.52 - 80.08] just it's just getting slammed slammed
[77.92 - 83.28] by all the stuff going around so how do
[80.08 - 84.88] we stay strong good to see you guys
[83.28 - 86.56] glad you guys are coming on right now
[84.88 - 89.20] making healing broth
[86.56 - 92.32] talking about also how to keep ourselves
[89.20 - 93.68] strong which is really important right
[92.32 - 94.48] right there i'm telling everybody it's
[93.68 - 96.96] like
[94.48 - 99.04] vitamin c vitamin c it's just like a
[96.96 - 102.40] broken record any friend that contacts
[99.04 - 104.56] me i got a cough i got the sniffles i
[102.40 - 107.28] got whatever how much vitamin c are you
[104.56 - 108.72] doing it's critical how much making the
[107.28 - 110.08] healing broth if you guys just came on
[108.72 - 112.32] here so i'm going to cut up an onion in
[110.08 - 114.56] a second and make some food
[112.32 - 116.40] so i'm excited about that michelle else
[114.56 - 120.00] is slammed i know right that's what
[116.40 - 122.08] happens it's it's going on out there so
[120.00 - 123.84] everybody's like oh no no it'll make me
[122.08 - 126.40] stronger it'll make me stronger that
[123.84 - 128.40] next cold will make me stronger the next
[126.40 - 130.16] flu will make me stronger
[128.40 - 130.88] uh no
[130.16 - 132.72] no
[130.88 - 134.24] unless you're doing something to take
[132.72 - 135.12] care of yourself protect yourself unless
[134.24 - 136.64] you're doing something because it
[135.12 - 138.32] doesn't necessarily make you stronger it
[136.64 - 140.64] beats you down
[138.32 - 142.08] and now you're like dragging or six
[140.64 - 143.52] months later now all of a sudden you're
[142.08 - 145.44] like why am i having these other
[143.52 - 147.04] problems like what's going on it's
[145.44 - 148.32] chipping away
[147.04 - 150.40] at your
[148.32 - 152.72] strength chipping away at the strength
[150.40 - 154.40] so you want to be on this stuff
[152.72 - 156.00] you want to be on
[154.40 - 157.52] what you don't want to be doing things
[156.00 - 158.96] like the healing broth is like that
[157.52 - 161.04] that's running
[158.96 - 163.36] all the time like i have that running
[161.04 - 164.96] all the time like every other day making
[163.36 - 166.96] healing broth
[164.96 - 169.84] because i just want it on hand so it's
[166.96 - 171.12] like even if i don't consume it even if
[169.84 - 173.44] i don't consume it because things are
[171.12 - 175.60] going crazy i put it in the fridge
[173.44 - 177.04] and then i reheat it or something but
[175.60 - 178.08] the healing broth is a great thing to
[177.04 - 180.08] have right now especially if you're
[178.08 - 181.44] feeling like
[180.08 - 183.84] wait a minute
[181.44 - 185.36] and is that a sore throat i'm losing my
[183.84 - 186.96] taste and smell
[185.36 - 189.44] wait a minute i can't taste anything i
[186.96 - 190.64] can't smell anything and i got the sore
[189.44 - 193.12] throat and
[190.64 - 195.76] got a cough coming on all of that so how
[193.12 - 197.52] do we stay strong you guys so we're not
[195.76 - 199.60] getting kicked down kick down that
[197.52 - 202.88] rabbit hole you can get kicked down that
[199.60 - 205.44] rabbit hole really far really far
[202.88 - 206.96] really far the flu's come every two
[205.44 - 208.24] months there's a new flu every two
[206.96 - 209.68] months there's a new flu call it what
[208.24 - 211.60] you want

[221.60 - 224.32] you're recovering you're doing okay okay

[331.12 - 334.64] do you what you don't have
[332.72 - 336.48] you don't have zinc
[334.64 - 338.40] it's like too bad
[336.48 - 340.16] too bad because it would be really great
[338.40 - 343.28] if you had the zeons that's what i tell
[340.16 - 344.08] my friends if you had the zinc
[343.28 - 346.08] right
[344.08 - 348.32] so these things are important do you
[346.08 - 350.40] have the olive leaf right there you have
[348.32 - 352.80] the olive leaf have that on hand what do
[350.40 - 355.28] you have do you have the best elderberry
[352.80 - 357.76] syrup i've ever seen
[355.28 - 359.20] come today like there's nothing else on
[357.76 - 361.04] the forefront that can touch the
[359.20 - 362.72] elderberry syrup this this one right
[361.04 - 365.44] here the vimergy one this is vermicy
[362.72 - 367.52] supplements i'm not sponsored
[365.44 - 369.20] very important to know not sponsored but
[367.52 - 371.68] the stuff is that good so this is the
[369.20 - 373.12] elderberry syrup like when you're coming
[371.68 - 375.28] down with something
[373.12 - 377.76] not even coming down with something
[375.28 - 381.04] if you're exposed
[377.76 - 384.00] or you're just yeah around people
[381.04 - 386.24] what i tell my family
[384.00 - 388.32] is you do a tablespoon of elderberry
[386.24 - 390.64] syrup every single day right now in this
[388.32 - 393.52] day and age when the world is freaking
[390.64 - 394.88] out and the bugs are going around
[393.52 - 396.24] that's what you do even if it's two
[394.88 - 398.08] teaspoons or a teaspoon of the
[396.24 - 400.32] elderberry syrup right now it's so
[398.08 - 403.20] important to know like it's an important
[400.32 - 405.36] time for it that's juiced elderberry
[403.20 - 407.76] there's no product on the planet that
[405.36 - 410.88] can touch this like when i look at other
[407.76 - 412.80] elderberry syrups now it's garbage
[410.88 - 414.88] that's how superseded like this is
[412.80 - 418.08] superseded any elderberry syrup i've
[414.88 - 420.32] ever seen anyhow anywhere
[418.08 - 422.00] it's just unbelievable
[420.32 - 424.56] and so when i look at other elderberry
[422.00 - 427.44] syrups i'm like oh yeah that's right
[424.56 - 428.56] that's the old way of doing things um
[427.44 - 432.16] that's just
[428.56 - 434.80] a dried elderberry basically and then a
[432.16 - 437.04] whole bunch of cane sugar in there
[434.80 - 438.48] low quality everything citric acid and
[437.04 - 440.16] everything else in there oh that's the
[438.48 - 441.84] old way
[440.16 - 443.68] you know this is the new way right here
[441.84 - 445.60] no one's ever done it before that's the
[443.68 - 447.44] most powerful way right what's the name
[445.60 - 450.96] of the elderberry syrup it's vimergy v
[447.44 - 450.96] is in victor i m as
[452.32 - 455.44] and i'm making the healing broth
[456.00 - 459.52] so i got the water heating up so let's
[457.68 - 460.32] chop some stuff up let's get an onion in
[459.52 - 462.56] here
[460.32 - 465.84] onions and garlic baby
[462.56 - 468.16] onions and garlic
[465.84 - 471.12] get the onions and garlic in you really
[468.16 - 471.12] important right there
[472.08 - 476.96] medicinal medicine
[474.96 - 479.84] onions and garlic
[476.96 - 483.44] is medicine right
[479.84 - 483.44] you need every edge you can get
[484.24 - 487.60] i'm using whatever ingredients i have on
[486.00 - 488.32] hand right now you guys
[487.60 - 490.08] right
[488.32 - 491.44] so i don't have all the perfect
[490.08 - 494.00] ingredients for
[491.44 - 496.40] medical medium healing broth right
[494.00 - 497.92] but i have close enough
[496.40 - 499.68] and if that's happening in your house
[497.92 - 502.16] and look all you have is certain things
[499.68 - 506.44] then then use it do it i'm getting the
[502.16 - 506.44] onion in there that's first off
[506.48 - 510.88] let's get that going in there
[508.56 - 510.88] right
[511.60 - 515.28] onion and garlic is the critical
[513.52 - 516.72] component when you're doing healing
[515.28 - 518.16] broth
[516.72 - 520.88] i know that everybody loves your chicken
[518.16 - 523.28] soup i'm not ranking on chicken soup
[520.88 - 525.76] it's just that the fat
[523.28 - 527.52] from the chicken
[525.76 - 528.96] stops your immune
[527.52 - 531.84] system
[528.96 - 535.84] you know from doing its job
[531.84 - 537.68] the reason why chicken soup
[535.84 - 540.80] is something that went down in history
[537.68 - 543.20] as being helpful for bugs going around
[540.80 - 544.96] is because it takes people off of
[543.20 - 546.16] sausage
[544.96 - 547.12] bacon
[546.16 - 548.48] ham
[547.12 - 550.00] pizza
[548.48 - 553.20] lots of cheese
[550.00 - 554.96] it takes them off of all that
[553.20 - 557.60] so they end up getting sick with the flu
[554.96 - 560.08] or cold and they find that they eat some
[557.60 - 562.32] chicken broth which is lighter than how
[560.08 - 565.36] they've been eating for probably years
[562.32 - 567.28] and that's why people got like a bump up
[565.36 - 568.88] from having chicken broth i'm not i'm
[567.28 - 569.76] not harping on it that's something you
[568.88 - 572.32] do
[569.76 - 574.16] no disrespect i'm not judging anybody
[572.32 - 576.16] that's not it i'm showing you guys a
[574.16 - 578.88] different way
[576.16 - 581.44] your white blood cells
[578.88 - 584.00] cannot easily clobber
[581.44 - 586.80] the bug you're fighting when there's fat
[584.00 - 588.24] in the bloodstream
[586.80 - 590.48] bottom line
[588.24 - 592.80] so when you're doing chicken soup you
[590.48 - 595.36] got all that chicken fat
[592.80 - 597.68] in the soup the chicken fat gets into
[595.36 - 600.08] your bloodstream and your immune system
[597.68 - 601.76] struggles yes it's better than your
[600.08 - 603.60] normal standard fare whatever you're
[601.76 - 605.44] doing processed foods fast food
[603.60 - 607.28] restaurants pizzas whatever it is and
[605.44 - 608.88] then you get sick and now you're eating
[607.28 - 610.16] chicken soup and it gives your body a
[608.88 - 612.24] little bit more of an edge to heal
[610.16 - 614.48] because it is lighter than what someone
[612.24 - 615.84] else might be already eating every day
[614.48 - 617.04] because first of all they get sick with
[615.84 - 618.72] food they're coughing they got no
[617.04 - 620.64] appetite for a while they go a day
[618.72 - 623.04] without really eating much of anything
[620.64 - 624.40] maybe a dry piece of toast
[623.04 - 626.16] and then they have some chicken soup
[624.40 - 628.24] it's the first time someone stopped
[626.16 - 630.64] eating the usual fare they usually eat
[628.24 - 632.24] for a long time so they get an edge
[630.64 - 633.92] but that's not enough especially with
[632.24 - 635.44] the bugs going around today the bugs
[633.92 - 637.68] going around today you guys gotta have
[635.44 - 640.00] more of an edge you don't want fat in
[637.68 - 642.56] the soup so just like chicken soup has a
[640.00 - 644.56] fat in it if i put oil in this healing
[642.56 - 646.80] broth i'm doing the same thing as if
[644.56 - 648.08] someone was having chicken soup
[646.80 - 651.28] how can you
[648.08 - 654.80] give your immune system the strength it
[651.28 - 658.08] needs when you got fat in the way
[654.80 - 660.64] stopping your white blood cells
[658.08 - 661.92] from going after the bugs
[660.64 - 663.76] and that's what happens all the fat in
[661.92 - 665.44] your bloodstream it's like becomes a big
[663.76 - 667.84] smokescreen
[665.44 - 669.60] and that's what goes wrong right
[667.84 - 671.20] so i got some
[669.60 - 673.04] onion in there let's get some garlic in
[671.20 - 674.48] there now
[673.04 - 676.08] best thing you can do
[674.48 - 678.00] when you're sick with what's happening
[676.08 - 680.64] right now stay off of the avocado the
[678.00 - 682.48] oils the nuts the seeds if you're vegan
[680.64 - 684.16] stay off of the animal products if
[682.48 - 686.24] you're animal protein if you're sick
[684.16 - 688.80] you're coughing you've got congestion in

[782.72 - 786.72] you don't even have to uh
[785.36 - 789.76] you know cut it up you don't have to
[786.72 - 792.64] chop it up you can just
[789.76 - 792.64] pop it right out
[792.96 - 797.28] if you see me hammering on this knife
[795.60 - 799.36] right i just said this earlier too if
[797.28 - 801.92] you see me hammering on this knife
[799.36 - 804.24] don't do it
[801.92 - 805.52] don't do it if you hammer on a knife
[804.24 - 808.72] like this
[805.52 - 810.64] the blade can't be angled to the inside
[808.72 - 813.76] so the blade the sharp part of the blade
[810.64 - 815.60] can't be angled to you so you can't put
[813.76 - 817.04] it down like that
[815.60 - 819.12] and hammer it
[817.04 - 820.48] see with the blade pointing to me you
[819.12 - 822.48] don't want to do that here's what
[820.48 - 826.08] happens you ready
[822.48 - 828.64] you have it's easy to flip up this way
[826.08 - 830.48] and go right on the knife i've seen
[828.64 - 832.40] people do it okay
[830.48 - 834.88] you want to have it flipped outward you
[832.40 - 837.44] want the sharp part going out
[834.88 - 839.76] going outward and then you put it down
[837.44 - 842.24] the knife doesn't flip easier up like
[839.76 - 844.56] that it doesn't it actually the weight
[842.24 - 846.24] of the knife does keep it down for some
[844.56 - 848.24] reason so you want to do
[846.24 - 850.40] it's the safest way to go
[848.24 - 852.88] if you're popping like
[850.40 - 854.16] the skins off the garlic

[1183.60 - 1186.88] water
[1184.72 - 1188.80] we're going to talk about powerful
[1186.88 - 1190.32] supplementation that's critical right
[1188.80 - 1194.40] now
[1190.32 - 1198.56] i mean when you have the medical medium
[1194.40 - 1199.92] z-i and c-shock therapy
[1198.56 - 1202.80] available
[1199.92 - 1205.52] when you start getting sick
[1202.80 - 1207.84] it's like one of those
[1205.52 - 1210.64] one of those protection methods that's
[1207.84 - 1210.64] so amazing
[1211.92 - 1216.40] it's there to cut it down in half if
[1214.64 - 1218.16] someone was going to get real sick
[1216.40 - 1220.32] they're going to get less sick maybe you
[1218.16 - 1223.76] can even forward it all together okay
[1220.32 - 1223.76] let's get the red bell pepper in there
[1227.92 - 1232.48] so let's talk about z-shock therapy
[1231.04 - 1235.28] so anybody wants to know what z-shock
[1232.48 - 1237.20] therapy is right there it is
[1235.28 - 1240.00] so that's the vimer g1
[1237.20 - 1242.80] it's a liquid zinc sulfate right there
[1240.00 - 1243.76] okay it's the only stable
[1242.80 - 1245.76] z
[1243.76 - 1248.56] on the market
[1245.76 - 1250.48] the other z's are not stable so right
[1248.56 - 1251.52] now when people say oh yeah okay i'll go
[1250.48 - 1252.72] get z
[1251.52 - 1255.28] okay well you're only going to probably
[1252.72 - 1256.48] get a fraction
[1255.28 - 1258.40] of
[1256.48 - 1260.80] of what can help you compare to what you
[1258.40 - 1262.40] can get out of the right product right
[1260.80 - 1265.12] if we came on here i'm not sponsored by
[1262.40 - 1267.84] vimergy i know them
[1265.12 - 1269.76] i've become friends with them
[1267.84 - 1271.60] um over the years just like i've become
[1269.76 - 1274.32] friends with probably
[1271.60 - 1277.36] many many other
[1274.32 - 1279.28] supplement company people because i want
[1277.36 - 1280.80] to make sure they can offer things and i
[1279.28 - 1282.64] could put like a little bug in there
[1280.80 - 1285.60] like hey can you keep out the natural
[1282.64 - 1287.28] flavors so you don't poison my people
[1285.60 - 1289.36] hey can you keep out the citric acid so
[1287.28 - 1291.12] you don't poison my people
[1289.36 - 1292.48] can you keep out the fillers that nobody
[1291.12 - 1294.24] knows about that are hidden in every
[1292.48 - 1296.00] supplement company and nobody realizes
[1294.24 - 1298.16] it so i try to make friends with
[1296.00 - 1300.16] everybody that's what i've done for
[1298.16 - 1303.04] 20 plus years
[1300.16 - 1305.44] and and any company that has even a
[1303.04 - 1306.96] partial quality product i want to know
[1305.44 - 1309.20] them
[1306.96 - 1311.52] i want to meet up
[1309.20 - 1312.96] i want to see how they do it
[1311.52 - 1315.52] because if i'm going to recommend
[1312.96 - 1317.20] something to my people or my family my
[1315.52 - 1318.40] friends or whatever i want to know it's
[1317.20 - 1319.92] incredible
[1318.40 - 1321.04] and that's the vimorgy product right
[1319.92 - 1322.00] there
[1321.04 - 1324.56] so
[1322.00 - 1326.40] z shock therapy right
[1324.56 - 1328.88] is what i've used all these years i've
[1326.40 - 1331.20] learned that from spirit of compassion
[1328.88 - 1333.76] where you can head off
[1331.20 - 1335.68] stave off that cold or that flu bug you
[1333.76 - 1337.60] can stave it off you can head it off the
[1335.68 - 1339.60] path right
[1337.60 - 1341.36] head it off at the pass right
[1339.60 - 1343.44] and that's that's what i love about z
[1341.36 - 1345.04] shock therapy so z shock therapy is
[1343.44 - 1347.36] every three hours
[1345.04 - 1349.12] two dropper pulls
[1347.36 - 1351.92] two dropper fulls
[1349.12 - 1354.48] every three hours waking hours veronica
[1351.92 - 1356.64] samara says mmm i'm the only one not
[1354.48 - 1358.80] sick at home from the bug dot dot
[1356.64 - 1361.28] following flu and cold protocols lemon

[1361.28 - 1364.56] incredible
[1362.48 - 1367.68] and and then you still have z-shock
[1364.56 - 1369.12] therapy too if you need it right
[1367.68 - 1372.00] two dropper fulls
[1369.12 - 1372.00] every three hours

[1383.92 - 1388.48] shot glass you could put it in there and
[1386.40 - 1390.56] add a little bit of water to it and then
[1388.48 - 1392.24] you've got yourself the z-shock therapy
[1390.56 - 1394.16] right

[1394.16 - 1397.28] really sick if you're coming down with
[1395.92 - 1398.40] something you do it for two or three
[1397.28 - 1400.64] days

[1405.20 - 1410.56] if i had a feather for any every time a
[1408.48 - 1413.68] feather every time
[1410.56 - 1414.96] someone said aw that saved my life
[1413.68 - 1417.20] aw
[1414.96 - 1420.00] i was half as sick as i would have been
[1417.20 - 1422.32] aw i never even got sick aw my sore
[1420.00 - 1424.56] throat went away aw i caught it in time
[1422.32 - 1425.84] and i did that z shock therapy if i had
[1424.56 - 1428.00] a feather
[1425.84 - 1430.48] i'd be flying i wouldn't have to i
[1428.00 - 1432.00] wouldn't have to book plane tickets
[1430.48 - 1433.36] i just literally
[1432.00 - 1435.68] just grab my
[1433.36 - 1438.16] million feathers stick them on me and
[1435.68 - 1440.32] try to fly
[1438.16 - 1442.80] you know so jacqueline says i love how
[1440.32 - 1446.16] tolerable the vimergy zinc is on the
[1442.80 - 1447.60] stomach it's the only one that i know
[1446.16 - 1449.44] people with sensitive stomachs can
[1447.60 - 1451.84] tolerate so that's the other thing
[1449.44 - 1453.44] because it's stabilized right
[1451.84 - 1455.36] unstabilizing
[1453.44 - 1457.04] which is all the other companies right
[1455.36 - 1459.04] now unfortunately i don't know why
[1457.04 - 1461.52] people can't get it right out there
[1459.04 - 1464.24] but it's unstabilized and then they they
[1461.52 - 1466.24] have to use terrible things like citric
[1464.24 - 1467.92] acid or whatever in there right
[1466.24 - 1470.72] and and it just burns a hole in your
[1467.92 - 1471.76] stomach so when people get sick
[1470.72 - 1473.20] from z
[1471.76 - 1474.48] they're just like they're just do they
[1473.20 - 1476.40] feel like they're getting a hole burned
[1474.48 - 1479.36] in your stomach right
[1476.40 - 1481.60] and like i said if i mean seriously
[1479.36 - 1484.16] so many people with with
[1481.60 - 1486.32] the z shock therapy what it's done
[1484.16 - 1487.60] zinc shock vitamin c and goldenseal have
[1486.32 - 1488.88] saved me
[1487.60 - 1491.44] cindy says
[1488.88 - 1494.96] incredible right
[1491.44 - 1496.16] so that's an important thing right now
[1494.96 - 1499.04] and look
[1496.16 - 1500.96] stomach flu is on its way that one's
[1499.04 - 1502.80] going to come through this winter
[1500.96 - 1503.84] on top of all the other stuff that's
[1502.80 - 1506.16] happening
[1503.84 - 1507.44] right and these bugs are
[1506.16 - 1508.96] virulent
[1507.44 - 1511.28] they're just that's just the way they
[1508.96 - 1513.36] are and it's about taking control having
[1511.28 - 1514.56] some empowerment empowering yourself be
[1513.36 - 1516.16] like you know what
[1514.56 - 1517.68] i'm going to have this on hand i'm going
[1516.16 - 1519.68] to have the ingredients on hand when i
[1517.68 - 1520.80] need it or go go out and get what i need
[1519.68 - 1522.64] if something's happening i'm going to
[1520.80 - 1524.40] have the healing broth i'm going to have
[1522.64 - 1526.72] the time water i'm going to have the
[1524.40 - 1529.36] time t i'm going to have lots of oranges
[1526.72 - 1531.36] on hand right lots of oranges all that
[1529.36 - 1534.24] incredible vitamin c
[1531.36 - 1536.24] all that matters too right
[1534.24 - 1537.36] you want your oranges on hand lots of
[1536.24 - 1539.36] those
[1537.36 - 1541.04] because what you can do
[1539.36 - 1542.80] is you can make yourself some fresh
[1541.04 - 1544.64] squeezed orange juice
[1542.80 - 1546.64] how about that for your white blood
[1544.64 - 1547.52] cells that's incredible right there
[1546.64 - 1549.76] right
[1547.52 - 1552.80] and you always keep some thyme in stock
[1549.76 - 1555.04] maybe grow it someday too in a pot right
[1552.80 - 1557.20] outside your porch or your window or on
[1555.04 - 1559.76] your windowsill something like that but
[1557.20 - 1562.00] having lots of time is really important
[1559.76 - 1564.00] having ginger on hand for ginger tea
[1562.00 - 1565.36] that's another one all on its own
[1564.00 - 1566.56] right
[1565.36 - 1569.20] so
[1566.56 - 1572.56] so having ginger tea on its own that's a
[1569.20 - 1572.56] great one you got your ginger
[1573.60 - 1577.76] so let's talk about time water for a
[1575.44 - 1577.76] minute
[1579.92 - 1584.80] you ready
[1582.16 - 1587.44] i put water
[1584.80 - 1589.68] in this jug
[1587.44 - 1591.36] right
[1589.68 - 1593.20] and then
[1591.36 - 1596.00] i take this time
[1593.20 - 1596.00] then i drop it in
[1596.72 - 1599.76] someone told me the other day it's too
[1598.08 - 1602.64] hard to do all this stuff
[1599.76 - 1604.08] that's what they said it's too hard
[1602.64 - 1607.04] you said hey i just want to tell you
[1604.08 - 1608.56] something i i i can't do this stuff
[1607.04 - 1610.24] i said what are you talking about
[1608.56 - 1612.08] i can't do the time whatever i'm like
[1610.24 - 1614.08] what
[1612.08 - 1616.64] i put water in the jug and i dropped
[1614.08 - 1618.64] fresh thyme in that's all i did
[1616.64 - 1620.56] now it goes in my fridge
[1618.64 - 1623.36] now it's a weapon
[1620.56 - 1625.68] against the bad guys

[2012.16 - 2016.40] here so this is vitamin c
[2014.48 - 2018.48] shock therapy
[2016.40 - 2020.40] every two hours
[2018.48 - 2022.16] two capsules
[2020.40 - 2023.36] the best vitamin c that's easy on the
[2022.16 - 2024.80] stomach so what happens when everybody
[2023.36 - 2026.64] gets the flu and they get the cold bugs
[2024.80 - 2028.48] their stomach goes south
[2026.64 - 2029.92] their stomachs just go sour a lot of
[2028.48 - 2031.92] people half the people who get the flu
[2029.92 - 2033.68] bugs end up throwing up all the mucus
[2031.92 - 2035.28] and their sinus congestion their sinus
[2033.68 - 2037.20] congestion and mucus their lungs and
[2035.28 - 2038.80] everything it's going into their stomach
[2037.20 - 2039.92] so what happens when someone catches a
[2038.80 - 2042.00] bug
[2039.92 - 2044.72] they're swallowing all the mucus all
[2042.00 - 2046.40] night long and their stomach gets sick
[2044.72 - 2048.00] that's why a lot of kids throw up that's
[2046.40 - 2049.52] like a lot of people throw up when they
[2048.00 - 2051.52] get the flu or the cold or they get the
[2049.52 - 2052.80] bug going around they're vomiting
[2051.52 - 2055.28] because
[2052.80 - 2056.72] their stomach is filled with mucus
[2055.28 - 2058.80] another reason why they're vomiting is
[2056.72 - 2060.40] because all the sinus pressure from the
[2058.80 - 2062.56] bug that's going around right now and
[2060.40 - 2063.52] i'm seeing it out there the sinus
[2062.56 - 2064.96] pressure
[2063.52 - 2066.48] is putting pressure on their vagus
[2064.96 - 2068.24] nerves
[2066.48 - 2070.72] so everybody has this pressure on the
[2068.24 - 2073.44] vagus nerves the sinus pressures are the
[2070.72 - 2075.36] sinus pressure is putting pressure on
[2073.44 - 2078.48] their facial nerve trigeminal nerve
[2075.36 - 2080.24] vagus nerves and optic nerves and that
[2078.48 - 2082.32] makes people throw up to you or get sick
[2080.24 - 2085.36] in the stomach so how am i going to take
[2082.32 - 2088.96] vitamin c aw if i'm so sick i can't even
[2085.36 - 2090.88] i i'm coughing i just have no appetite
[2088.96 - 2093.28] i can only get a piece of dry toast down
[2090.88 - 2096.00] like what do i do i'm like dude
[2093.28 - 2097.92] get the micro c because it's really
[2096.00 - 2099.44] gentle on the stomach so you can do
[2097.92 - 2100.64] something about it while you're trying
[2099.44 - 2102.56] to heal
[2100.64 - 2104.24] so that's the vitamin c shock therapy
[2102.56 - 2106.24] medical mean vitamin c vitamin c shock
[2104.24 - 2107.84] therapy right there
[2106.24 - 2109.92] two capsules
[2107.84 - 2112.00] every two waking hours you got some

[2170.48 - 2174.08] gets by you get sick and sick and sick
[2172.72 - 2176.64] and sicker sure
[2174.08 - 2178.32] if you're not so sick i get it if you're
[2176.64 - 2179.52] not so sick and you're young and you're
[2178.32 - 2180.96] indestructible and you only have a
[2179.52 - 2181.92] little rash or a little bit like a
[2180.96 - 2183.60] pimple
[2181.92 - 2184.96] you get three pimples and you run to a
[2183.60 - 2186.08] functional medicine doctor because your
[2184.96 - 2187.84] tummy is a little funny and you got
[2186.08 - 2190.48] three pimples you got a little bit of
[2187.84 - 2191.68] bloating you you yep you got it under
[2190.48 - 2193.60] control with your functional medicine
[2191.68 - 2195.92] doctors and everything else right
[2193.60 - 2197.68] because you're not really sick you're
[2195.92 - 2199.76] you got a couple of little things but
[2197.68 - 2201.76] you're in the not so sick group right
[2199.76 - 2204.16] but man when you're sick
[2201.76 - 2206.00] it's like land mine land mine stab in
[2204.16 - 2208.56] the back land mine
[2206.00 - 2210.72] pitfall pitfall pothole pothole it's
[2208.56 - 2212.80] like it's crazy how do you how does
[2210.72 - 2214.24] anybody even survive they don't they go
[2212.80 - 2216.32] downhill downhill downhill downhill
[2214.24 - 2217.44] until no one no one everybody forgets
[2216.32 - 2218.72] about them
[2217.44 - 2221.12] you know how many people are just you
[2218.72 - 2223.44] dropping like flies out there all around
[2221.12 - 2225.60] the world and then they just disappear
[2223.44 - 2226.80] oh yeah that person used to work here i
[2225.60 - 2229.44] don't know what happened to them two
[2226.80 - 2230.72] years ago who cares
[2229.44 - 2232.16] jeanette i see medical medium
[2230.72 - 2234.64] information all the time taken by
[2232.16 - 2238.24] doctors on ads oh my god jeanette
[2234.64 - 2240.24] i just had a a meeting about that
[2238.24 - 2241.52] here's what's happening
[2240.24 - 2243.60] all the doctors have taken medical
[2241.52 - 2244.88] medium original unique information out
[2243.60 - 2246.40] of the books
[2244.88 - 2248.08] that's only been put in the books
[2246.40 - 2249.68] nowhere else right
[2248.08 - 2250.96] they've taken it they've hijacked it
[2249.68 - 2252.40] they have no studies to show where it
[2250.96 - 2253.60] comes from because they don't come from
[2252.40 - 2254.88] studies they come from medical medium
[2253.60 - 2256.88] literature
[2254.88 - 2258.16] and they're they're banking off it right
[2256.88 - 2259.84] that's what they're doing right but
[2258.16 - 2262.08] that's just one area
[2259.84 - 2264.24] i'm seeing it everywhere we see it
[2262.08 - 2265.68] everywhere medical medium information so
[2264.24 - 2268.24] the goal is
[2265.68 - 2271.04] censor medical medium wherever we can
[2268.24 - 2273.92] so medical medium doesn't take credit
[2271.04 - 2276.48] so that his people people who find them
[2273.92 - 2278.08] can't find him and get better so that
[2276.48 - 2279.84] they take the medical media information
[2278.08 - 2281.44] they chop it up dice it up they put it
[2279.84 - 2283.28] out there they add their other stuff to
[2281.44 - 2285.20] it people don't really get better from
[2283.28 - 2286.64] it they don't give credit to the good
[2285.20 - 2288.64] stuff they're using
[2286.64 - 2291.12] from medical media
[2288.64 - 2293.36] it's just it's sad
[2291.12 - 2295.36] i don't care about the credit
[2293.36 - 2297.84] i could care less i didn't go into this
[2295.36 - 2299.20] if i wanted credit i would have done 10
[2297.84 - 2300.32] shows tv series because i've been
[2299.20 - 2301.76] offered all the tv series for the
[2300.32 - 2304.40] medical medium tv series all on
[2301.76 - 2306.48] mainstream tv all the different networks

[2568.56 - 2574.24] vitamin c in here so that actually has
[2571.12 - 2576.00] vitamin c in it which is who does that
[2574.24 - 2577.52] in an elderberry syrup

[2577.52 - 2582.56] put eight cups of water in the in there
[2580.08 - 2584.80] somewhere around there i wasn't actually
[2582.56 - 2587.04] counting perfectly and this is done this
[2584.80 - 2589.84] broth is done by the way
[2587.04 - 2591.28] b12 is critical for recovery especially
[2589.84 - 2593.68] with neurological symptoms when we get
[2591.28 - 2595.44] sick with a cold flu which is really
[2593.68 - 2596.24] important

[2600.64 - 2604.16] these things are important
[2602.16 - 2606.56] i'm not sponsored by them by the
[2604.16 - 2608.96] emergencies vimrgy.com v isn't victor i
[2606.56 - 2611.44] am as mary e rgy.com the stuff is
[2608.96 - 2613.52] superior
[2611.44 - 2615.60] which is unbelievable it's just
[2613.52 - 2617.44] incredible we talked about time t we got
[2615.60 - 2618.80] time water right here on recap you guys
[2617.44 - 2620.32] we got that we got the healing broth
[2618.80 - 2622.48] let's get a little bit of healing broth
[2620.32 - 2622.48] out
[2626.88 - 2630.76] get the lid off of this
[2634.16 - 2639.44] now i'm not straining this right now
[2637.04 - 2641.52] i'm just actually using this just to get
[2639.44 - 2643.60] the broth out see you guys i'm sure
[2641.52 - 2645.04] you've done this before right
[2643.60 - 2646.56] okay
[2645.04 - 2649.92] so basically i'm pushing this down in
[2646.56 - 2649.92] there and i'm just getting the broth
[2650.80 - 2654.00] i think what i'm going to do is use a
[2652.72 - 2657.00] see-through
[2654.00 - 2657.00] bowl
[2663.76 - 2668.48] how's this
[2665.84 - 2668.48] does that work
[2671.20 - 2674.32] might get a little piece of carrot in
[2672.80 - 2676.72] there because what i'm doing is just
[2674.32 - 2679.12] bringing this down into the bra you know
[2676.72 - 2680.32] i'm kind of letting the
[2679.12 - 2682.80] the broth
[2680.32 - 2684.80] spill on to the spoon i mean to the
[2682.80 - 2686.00] ladle
[2684.80 - 2689.48] and that's what i'm doing right now so
[2686.00 - 2689.48] i'm getting this broth
[2690.08 - 2695.44] all that congestion in the lungs all
[2692.72 - 2697.04] that congestion in the sinuses
[2695.44 - 2699.44] and you sit over this thing and you
[2697.04 - 2700.32] breathe in the steamy hot broth and then
[2699.44 - 2703.04] you
[2700.32 - 2704.32] blow on the spoon and you you suck it
[2703.04 - 2706.88] right in and all those chemical
[2704.32 - 2709.68] compounds get driven into the body how
[2706.88 - 2713.04] incredible is that
[2709.68 - 2715.12] is it okay to freeze the broth yes it is
[2713.04 - 2719.28] yes it is
[2715.12 - 2721.92] so that's the broth right there
[2719.28 - 2723.28] how long does the broth keep
[2721.92 - 2724.16] i keep it in the fridge for a couple
[2723.28 - 2727.12] days
[2724.16 - 2729.92] a couple days easy to reheat it
[2727.12 - 2732.32] to freeze it too if you want
[2729.92 - 2734.80] gail says i've only known you for a week
