1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
okay

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,040
telegram

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,920
facebook youtube tick tock we're live

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
right now we're talking about

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,040
plant-based versus animal base and we're

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,799
gonna talk about the difference between

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,560
plant-based medical medium style

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
animal protein

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,760
medical medium style

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,279
because you could be on an animal

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
protein diet a clean one or you can be

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,560
on this animal protein diet or this keto

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
animal protein diet if you're like oh

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,480
i'm doing medical medium on the anal

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,199
protein i'm keeping it clean whatever

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,600
i'm keeping it nice and good and no

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
you could be plant-based or vegan

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440
and be like well i went medical medium

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
i'm vegan now it's like

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
dude

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
you can go vegan out there in the vegan

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,440
world

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,039
and get sick

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
that's what you can do i've watched it

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,680
for years and years and years for

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,440
30 years out there because

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,480
it's not just medical medium is vegan

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,039
because vegans nutritional yeast vegans

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,120
all kinds of stuff vegan is soy sauce

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,799
with msg vegan is uh high fat vegan is

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,479
tons of nuts and seeds and nut butters

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,720
vegan is oils fried in pans vegan is

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,240
so it's like i went vegan a medical

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
medium that i went vegan it's like what

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
do you mean did you do are you medical

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
medium plant-based are you just

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,439
plant-based or vegan because you could

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
do that all wrong and not heal you know

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,240
i went i cleaned up i got rid of

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
processed foods and now i'm animal

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
protein keto animal protein you know

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
keeping it all good but i'm doing

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,840
medical medium sure but are you doing it

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
right are you doing it wrong

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
how are you doing it how are you doing

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
your animal protein are you still doing

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,159
eggs

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,119
because if you still got eggs in your

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
animal protein medical medium diet

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,159
then we're in trouble if you're still

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
doing cheese and dairy in your medical

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,119
medium animal protein diet then we're in

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
trouble

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,280
so

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,119
that's something to consider right there

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
that's something to understand so we're

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
talking about plant-based

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
versus animal base that's what we're

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,040
talking about there and you can do them

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
both wrong and not heal there's plenty

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,960
of sick vegan people out there plenty of

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,599
sick plant-based people out there plenty

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,360
in fact where do they go after they get

64
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,959
sick they run back to animal protein

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
they start out animal protein early in

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
their life they get sick then they go

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,599
vegan they get a little bit better they

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
find some vegan doctor they find some

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
vegan doctor online they're doing this

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
and then they get sick again

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,599
and now they're back on eggs and now

72
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
they're back on dairy products right you

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
guys have you seen that and then they're

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
back on eggs and dairy and everything

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,160
else right i just want to give everybody

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
before we go into the plant-based versus

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
animal base which is really an important

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
topic i can't wait to cover it

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,599
um this pretty much the last day for the

80
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
sale on the juicer just letting

81
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
everybody know i figured i'd do that

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,720
because

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
once the sale is over and then the dms

84
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,879
start coming through and then people are

85
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,400
commenting where do i get a juicer

86
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
what's the best juicer and i'm like oh

87
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
my god you're going to pay full price oh

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,159
my god you're going to pay full price

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,840
and which is fine because it's still

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,920
inexpensive compared to other juicers

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
but the point is is that why not save

92
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,120
it's 50 off so

93
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
why not um and i talked about why this

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,920
juice is so amazing it saves you so much

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
money that it pays for itself a couple

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
of months the juicer is already paid for

97
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,959
so it's like you didn't even buy it

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
basically i call this like a free juicer

99
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,400
in a way because it saves you so much

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
money when you're juicing and other

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,159
juicers don't that it actually pays for

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
itself in just a month or two it's the

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,319
mm 900 hds it's the last day of the sale

104
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,840
about that in a little bit of why it's

110
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
so incredible and why you save money and

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
why it matters so and you can use

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,720
anything in this machine but it's the

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
the sale or tomorrow morning is the last

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
day all i know it's coming to the net

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,120
it's coming to an end so i'm just

117
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
letting everybody know but i've already

118
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
saved thousands in food food costs

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
because the juicer so it's technically

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
bought me like 20 30 juicers or whatever

121
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
it is yeah whatever it is i don't know

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
how it's so you know it's incredible so

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,040
back to plant-based versus animal-based

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
right

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,760
a really important topic hey i'm doing

126
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
vegan right now you know and and i'm

127
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,640
doing medical medium i went vegan it's

128
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
like

129
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,239

are you mixing it up with other vegan

133
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,000
whatever because chances are you're in

134
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
trap land and you're stepping in

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
landmines and stepping in traps

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000

later

143
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
because you're sick you went sick when

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880

doing i'm doing plant-based and i'm

161
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
doing medical medium but you're doing

162
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,440
apple cider vinegar you're not doing

163
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,199
medical medium you're not it's okay if

164
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
you want to dabble look

165
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,720
there are lots of people that dabble and

166
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
they dabble and with different things

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
and they're using medical medium stuff

168
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
they're juicing some celery juice or

169
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
their closet drinking celery juice or

170
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
whatever they're doing out there or

171
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
they're doing some other tools that they

172
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
learned from medical medium like zinc or

173
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,880
something else and they're doing things

174
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
and then they're dabbling though

175
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,440
and they're doing their apple cider

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
vinegar because they found out there's

177
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,400
some other vegan blah blah that when we

178
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
do apple cider vinegar this looks good

179
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
but when they get sick

180
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,919
they'll be back over to animal protein

181
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,759
like a run they'll run scared and

182
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,440
they'll be like i did the vegan thing i

183
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
tried medical medium they didn't try

184
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,400
medical medium they were doing somebody

220
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,360
medium unless it's medical medium

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
where you're doing the plant-based

222
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
diet

223
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
but you're doing maybe the medical

224
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,880
medium mono cleanser doing the 3-6-9

225
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560

226
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,599
cleanse

227
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,360
moderation doesn't work

228
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
when you're really sick

229
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,919
moderation leads to desperation i told

230
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,759
you guys it leads to desperation the

231
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
moderation game takes you to a place

232
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
where you end up getting in trouble look

233
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,319
you don't have to be perfect i'm going

234
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
to tell you right now

235
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,599
this is important to know right you're

236
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,199
probably thinking well what now i got to

237
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,800
like i got to walk such a straight line

238
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,680
with my foods i got to walk such a

239
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,639
straight line with everything

240
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,360
if you're really chronically ill

241
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
the details matter and you do have to

242
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
walk that straight line

243
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,199
if you can't get there yet fine but just

244
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
know that

245
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,360
if you can't get there yet just know

246
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,599
that though

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,199
symptoms can be stubborn and if they're

248
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
stubborn with you

249
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,960
and your symptoms are really hanging in

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,120
there then we got to walk the straight

251
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,319
line we have to get there

252
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
we do

253
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,800
you'll be running

371
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
for those eggs you know why vegans don't

372
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
rip down eggs first of all they don't

373
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,079
know what they do

374
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
unless they know mm info they don't know

375
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
that eggs feed all the viruses inside

376
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,639
your body to keep you sick eggs feed all

377
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,880
the bacteria and fungus and yeast and

378
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,279
mold that's inside your body and keeps

379
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,680
you sick so eggs feed

380
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,360
all the stuff inside of us

381
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
that keeps us sick

382
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
right

383
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
and i talked about that over and over

384
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
again you guys know i talked about the

385
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,600
books and stuff like that but what

386
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
happens with vegans and the plant-based

387
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,680
people they get sick because they're

388
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
cranking the high fats they're drowning

389
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
their gallbladders and liver out they're

390
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,560
killing their pancreases with the fats

391
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
they're told to eat too much fat right

392
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
and then they're doing that and then

393
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
they're doing the poisons like the msg

394
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
and the apple cider vinegar and

395
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,600
everything and they're burning

396
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,279
themselves out

397
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,279
and then their pathogens crank up

398
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,839
and when their pathogens crank up

399
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,600
they're sick as a vegan

400
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,920
and now they're proving the animal

401
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,519
protein world right that veganism is

402
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,600
you know the animal protein

403
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,079
tagline it's like yeah vegans what what

404
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
a you know all the vegans are sick all

405
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,200
the plant-based people are sick

406
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,360
meanwhile

407
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
all the animal protein people are sick

408
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
two

409
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
all of them the keto people they get

410
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
sick sure if you've never been sick

411
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,399
before and you're some guy that had a

412
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
little bit of weight on you and you go

413
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,199
into the gym for the first time in your

414
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
life and you're 35 years old and you

415
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,880
start eating keto

416
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,240
you're yeah you're gonna start looking a

417
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
little better and feel a little better

418
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
because it's it's definitely better than

419
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
what you were doing but if you get a

420
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,240
real problem that keto diet will kill

421
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
you

422
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
you can do animal protein but if you do

423
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,560
it right and you do a medical medium

424
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,639
style you can stand a chance

425
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,800
plant same thing with the plant-based

426
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
stuff right

427
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
same thing with the plant-based stuff

428
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,199
you can do the plant-based stuff totally

429
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
wrong

430
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,240
totally wrong

431
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
and get yourself sick

432
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
and then you're sucking down those eggs

433
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,959
know why plant-based people don't rip

434
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
apart eggs because man they love their

435
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
eggs they went plant-based and it's the

436
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
one place they feel like if they just

437
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
get convinced that

438
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,600
eggs are still really good for them

439
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,680
they'll eat them again right and if they

440
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
get sick man they're gonna be back

441
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,600
they're gonna be back on their eggs if

442
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
they get sick thumbs up if you like this

443
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000

[Music]

562
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,440
people complain about celery costing

563
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,520
money while this saves you the money and

564
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,679
pays for itself so this juicer pays for

565
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,679
itself

566
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,000

604
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,679
this is not a camera trick

605
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,400
that's dry

606
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,400
that's dry

607
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,120
can you believe that

608
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,760
i mean i'm serious

609
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,600
it blows my mind every time

610
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
that's dry pulp

611
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,840
everything's squeezed out of it that's a

612
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,559
dry pulp container

613
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,400
what i mean when i look at it i'm like

614
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,880
this is like for real

615
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,320
like in fact it's so dry it's so dry

616
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
it's actually like

617
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,760
it's kind of like freaking me out a

618
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,280
little bit because it doesn't make any

619
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,120
sense but it does make sense it's

620
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,799
designed to squeeze basically every last

621
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
drop out of your celery and then you

622
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
save because you now you can buy you

623
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,480
know you buy less celery and then that's

624
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,240
20 you just saved and then it adds up

625
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
and then the juicers paid for and then

626
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
boom like how insane is that it's just

627
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
crazy this is

628
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,840
crazy

629
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,679
karen says can the celery juice be

630
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,840
frozen if not how many days can you

631
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,600
store it in the fridge look

632
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,640
24 hours in the fridge is not the end of

633
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,320
the world

634
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,960
sometimes i've gone gone as far as 48

635
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,720
hours and then consumed it okay so if

636
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,159
you had to do 48 hours in the fridge and

637
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
consuming it's still better than

638
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,280
anything else you can get out there

639
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
okay

640
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,320
if you have to freeze it because you

641
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,760
need it a week later or something like

642
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,640
that freeze it

643
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,200
don't add any water to it don't add any

644
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,360
any ice to it don't add any lemon to it

645
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
don't add anything to it you guys so

646
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,480
important

647
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,240
so important but did you see that i'm

648
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,799
still actually like

649
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,480
it's so dry it's coming out like dust

650
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,799
and the bottom's dry it's just

651
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,520
the amount you save is ridiculous and

652
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,120
it's incredible

653
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,559
and that's that's what's amazing right

654
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
there on its own

655
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,320
i love it

656
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,559
it's it's it's it's my favorite you know

657
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,159
it's so incredible another thing too to

658
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,360
know that you want to strain it so i'm

659
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,760
showing everybody right now that you

660
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,520
want to strain your celery juice so keep

661
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,720
in mind that you always want to strain

662
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,159
it this is an herbal extraction like tea

663
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,400
okay when you have herbal tea you're

664
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,799
extracting herbal medicine from that tea

665
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
so if you have your chamomile tea just

666
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,520
say

667
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
or your peppermint tea or if you're

668
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
having your licorice tea chamomile tea

669
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
whatever tea you're having right and

670
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,320
because a lot of people drink chamomile

671
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
tea that's why i'm using that one and

672
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
you

673
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,000
do your tea bag your chamomile tea bag

674
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,720
in there you don't cut open the tea bag

675
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
and get all those you get those gritty

676
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,280
pieces of

677
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
fiber because the it was extracted you

678
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,960
did the hot water extraction in your

679
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,840
herbal tea you see

680
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,080
so

681
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,679
that's the same thing this is not a

682
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,600
vegetable

683
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
so important for you guys to know that

684
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,360
this is not a vegetable it's not a

685
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,200
veggie it's not

686
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
and when you hear a dietitian out there

687
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,360
or hear you if you hear even a

688
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,520
plant-based so-called expert or a vegan

689
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,799
expert call it a vegetable it's like

690
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,120
whoa

691
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,120
whoa you just don't know you just don't

692
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,200
know when you hear that

693
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,799
it's like they don't get it

694
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,080
that's an herbal extraction this is

695
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,760
herbal medicine it's partly why it heals

696
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,280
people to the degree it does it's really

697
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,799
so healing right

698
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,960
so

699
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
why is celery juice healing us why is it

700
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
healing millions of people around the

701
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,880
world

702
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,960
why is it doing that dr fine good to see

703
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,559
you incredible

704
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,640
do you eat the shells of the nuts

705
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
that's really funny if you're sensitive

706
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,520
because you got a lot of pathogens and

707
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
you don't know it like you got the h

708
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,600
pylori in your gut and you got the e

709
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,279
coli and the c diff and you got the

710
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,799
streptococcus and you don't know this

711
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,279
but you're filled with yeast mold

712
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,720
unproductive fungus and pathogens and

713
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,720
everything inside your body and your

714
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,880
liver inside your intestinal tract and

715
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,799
you do celery juice

716
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
you might be a little sensitive so you

717
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,520
start with a smaller amount when you

718
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,840
first start you don't have to throw out

719
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,080
16 to 32 ounces you can start with four

720
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,240
ounces and build yourself up start with

721
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,480
eight ounces right maybe you can go into

722
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,080
it right away at 16 ounces

723
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
and you can do that

724
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,400
celery juice is a complete electrolyte

725
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
that's why it holds power you guys so

726
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,840
let's cover that for a second this is

727
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
important right

728
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,520
this is really important

729
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
your brain

730
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,919
needs electrolytes

731
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,919
critical

732
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,720
trace mineral salts and electrolytes but

733
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,279
it doesn't need salt

734
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,880
like salt you're throwing on like sea

735
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,240
salt on your food or rock salt or

736
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,840
it doesn't need some that kind of salt

737
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,400
it needs

738
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,640
trace minerals

739
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
that are attached to the sodium in

740
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,320
celery it's an entirely different salt

741
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,480
it's not the same

742
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,880
it's not the same as sea salt or the

743
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,120
same as as like a rock salt or anything

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
okay this is packed with trace minerals

745
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,200
sodium cluster salt so that's basically

746
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,279
you've got a little solar system with

747
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,039
trace minerals around it

748
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,039
inside of here

749
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,520
and it goes to the brain and it

750
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,840
recharges your neurotransmitters

751
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
and your neurons your neurotransmitters

752
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,200
and neurons is really important to know

753
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,799
it's a complete electrolyte so let's

754
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
cover that for a second every time you

755
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,320
eat check this out

756
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,880
if you guys got a second

757
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,720
i know you're busy

758
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,440
if you eat something

759
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,400
you're trying to collect an electrolyte

760
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,919
from it parts of electrolytes so when

761
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,400
you have a banana or you have a nut or

762
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,960
you have avocado or you have a little

763
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,960
piece of chicken whatever you eat

764
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,880
what you're doing is you're trying to

765
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
collect electrolytes from everything

766
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
you're eating did you guys know that

767
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
you're trying to collect electrolytes

768
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
from everything you're eating

769
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
but guess what dr sherry green good to

770
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,679
see you they're not complete

771
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,039
electrolytes

772
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,880
it's not complete you're trying to

773
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,480
piecemeal your electrolytes with

774
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,799
everything you're eating so when you

775
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,120
have your salad you're trying to piece

776
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,880
together electrolytes when you have your

777
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,039
animal protein you're trying to piece

778
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
together some if you're plant-based and

779
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,480
you're having your nut butter as an

780
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
avocado you're trying to piece together

781
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,640
electrolytes

782
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,720
but guess what

783
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,279
why is celery juice reversing disease

784
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
healing people changing their lives

785
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
turning their lives around like no

786
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,799
tomorrow

787
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,559
one of the reasons is it's a complete

788
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,080
electrolyte there's nothing else on the

789
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,919
planet that's a complete electrolyte

790
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,640
news flash

791
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,640
there's nothing else on the planet

792
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
that's a complete

793
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
electrolyte

794
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,039
and that's what's incredible about that

795
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,320
it's just one big huge reason

796
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,400
all right

797
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,559
if you guys just got on i was telling

798
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,279
everybody that's 50 off it's like the

799
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,720
sales ending it's ending soon i just i

800
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,880
just blew my mind again by talking about

801
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
the pulp and how dry the container is

802
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,720
right

803
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,320
celery juice kills pathogens viruses and

804
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,200
bacteria

805
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,919
all the bad stuff inside of us it starts

806
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
to kill it so as you drink your celery

807
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
juice

808
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,000
it's starting to kill

809
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,840
those bugs inside of us so everybody's

810
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,600
running around you've got hashimoto's

811
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,000
well guess what you've got epsine bar in

812
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,320
your thyroid you got eczema psoriasis

813
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,039
you got epsin bar in your liver okay you

814
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,080
got acne you got streptococcus in your

815
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:50,000
lymphatic system and your liver and

816
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,919
other places see that's how it works

817
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,919
so these little bugs are why everybody's

818
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,919
sick you've got neurological lime you've

819
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,240
got both strep and you've got lots of

820
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,559
bugs like shingles

821
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,640
epstein-barr

822
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,120
you get fever blisters any of you guys

823
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,919
could ever get a fever blister simplex

824
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,640
one

825
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,799
that simplex not friendly likes to hide

826
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
all in the nerves the trigeminal nerves

827
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,840
loves to hide in there

828
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,039
loves to hide in the brain stem

829
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,279
sometimes and then it creates all these

830
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,159
migraines in people creates all these

831
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,720
other things trigeminal neuralgia you're

832
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,919
hurting here well guess what celery

833
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,520
juice

834
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,080
kills off

835
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,240
that simplex which is your trigeminal

836
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,200
neuralgia think about that how

837
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,679
incredible is that you guys

838
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,399
it's one of the medical medium tools but

839
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,360
it's a great start

840
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,440
and it's a great finish

841
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,840
that's incredible talk a little bit

842
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
about the uh plant-based

843
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,799
animal protein thing

844
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,159
okay

845
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,919
so the animal protein people are

846
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
infamous for ripping apart plant-based

847
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,760
diet people

848
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,919
back in the older day you guys it was so

849
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,919
rough every time spirit of compassion

850
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,039
wanted to get somebody on the plant base

851
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,720
right the proper plant-based foods so

852
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
they can heal

853
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,320
they'd be up against the whole thing of

854
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,080
like angry family members angry doctors

855
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,039
saying you're starving yourself eating

856
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,880
fruits and herbs and wild foods and

857
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,360
vegetables and leafy greens and it was

858
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,520
never easy for the plant-based you know

859
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,279
someone going plant-based right now it's

860
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,840
more accepted the whole bit but still

861
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,159
the animal protein movement still says

862
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,080
some of the same talking points

863
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,840
you're eating rabbit food you're

864
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,520
starving your children

865
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,600
you're hurting your children by not

866
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,679
giving them enough protein you're

867
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,200
protein deficient yourself like they say

868
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,960
all kinds of terrible talking points

869
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
right and then the plant-based vegan

870
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,320
people you know attack the protein

871
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,080
people and the animal protein people and

872
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,640
say you're killing animals

873
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,440
you're heartless you're cruel

874
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,360
right and so they're two diet belief

875
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,760
systems

876
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,679
medical medium information this is so

877
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,320
important details matter

878
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,600
okay is about why you're sick it's not

879
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,799
about picking a side of a diet belief

880
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,520
system

881
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,279
if you pick a side of a diet belief

882
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,799
system

883
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,480
you just

884
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,159
screwed a whole bunch of people

885
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,240
where they won't heal

886
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,799
doctors do it all the time

887
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,679
you screw over a whole bunch of people

888
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,120
and they don't heal if you pick a diet

889
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,600
belief system

890
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,600
practitioners and nutritionists

891
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,320
totally do it all the time

892
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,960
once you pick one side

893
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,039
you're not you're gonna not get a lot of

894
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,559
people better

895
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,799
that's how it works if you go one side

896
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,320
it's not good now you can be on one side

897
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,919
you can be plant-based and you stay

898
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,240
plant-based you can be animal protein

899
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,159
stay animal protein if you want

900
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,679
i always tell plant-based people stay

901
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,399
plant-based if you're plant-based you

902
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,320
better believe it stay plant-based

903
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,480
learn how to do it right so you don't

904
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,720
get in trouble and if you're animal

905
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
protein stay animal protein but learn

906
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
how to do it right so you did get in

907
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,760
trouble mm info was never on one side of

908
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,960
the aisle or another

909
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,720
and that's why so many people got their

910
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,720
lives back because they brought in

911
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,720
medical medium tools while they were

912
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,559
animal protein they were doing it right

913
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,080
while they were plant-based and doing it

914
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,600
right and they brought in the medical

915
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,440
medium tools

916
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,440
you guys hear that on tick-tock telegram

917
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,279
it's the only healing community

918
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,919
that doesn't pick sides we got animal

919
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,200
protein people here and we got plant

920
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,159
people here

921
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,320
that's right and always did

922
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,600
the other communities

923
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,080
it's like political or something it's

924
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,640
either your plant-based

925
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,960
or it's the animal protein community the

926
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,840
keto community animal keto and then the

927
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,519
plant-based keto

928
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,200
right just just plant-based diet eating

929
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,799
tons of fats

930
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,039
people just do it no matter what you

931
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,960
don't have to name keto or not

932
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,720
they're just doing it

933
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,640
and on that note of keto anyway on a

934
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,760
separate note if you guys want a detail

935
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,720
that matters no one's keto

936
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,799
because

937
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,519
the minute they went off the carnival

938
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,440
keto was just the carnivore diet back

939
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,360
years ago decades ago

940
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,279
because the only way to go into ketosis

941
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,200
is just be on meat only

942
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,120
no one's on meat only unless they do the

943
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
carnivore diet the carnivore diet should

944
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,399
get a new name it should be called the

945
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
keto diet unless the carnivore diet

946
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,919
throws in sugar which they did now and

947
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
they've thrown in honey so they're not

948
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,399
keto either

949
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
they used to be keto but nobody's keto

950
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,200
it's another way you know something's

951
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,519
wrong with the system when they can't

952
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,279
even get their facts right

953
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,480
so when you're doing keto you're totally

954
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,080
like screwed over in the whole of the

955
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,360
whole thing and i'll say it i say that a

956
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
lot because when you're duped and

957
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,039
tricked

958
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,799
and the walls pulled over your eyes

959
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,840
right

960
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,080
and you've been bamboozled

961
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,000
that's what it is

962
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,159
and basically been through though dupe

963
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,120
shrimp bamboozle

964
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,120
all of that will pull over your eyes

965
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,880
that's what that is

966
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,799
so here you are thinking you're keto but

967
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,120
you're not you can't go into ketosis

968
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,799
because avocado has sugar in it

969
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,480
avocado was never in the keto diet the

970
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,480
keto diet killed people because there

971
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,480
was no sugar in it

972
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,480
the keto diet killed people back in the

973
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,880
day did you guys know that

974
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,519
they died when they

975
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,399
actually only did it they did it like

976
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,880
where it's ketosis where you only do

977
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,960
little pieces of meat all day

978
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,640
six months eight months later a year

979
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,159
later they would go into some kind of

980
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
kidney failure

981
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,919
and die

982
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,000
but see keto diet lets in berries now

983
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,000
when they lay in avocados there's sugar

984
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,480
in those so you can't go into ketosis

985
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,200
get it right people not you guys the

986
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,640
keto people the so-called experts nuts

987
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,880
have sugar in them that's why they're

988
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,200
sweet so many nuts are sweet

989
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,960
cheese has sugar in it so what they did

990
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,280
was they let cheese and nuts and avocado

991
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,399
and green juices that have sugar in them

992
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,560
they're letting all these sugar

993
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,079
like avenues in

994
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
all these foods that have sugar in them

995
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,919
so it's not keto

996
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,520
like how can you plan on healing

997
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,960
when they don't even have it right know

998
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,000
what they're even talking about now

999
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
you're somebody who might be like well i

1000
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,079
got better on keto okay fine but when

1001
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,879
you get real sick

1002
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,679
you'll see where up you've got duped

1003
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,760
that's how it's done out there

1004
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,159
and you can dabble in medical medium

1005
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,159
totally cool i want you to do that if

1006
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,200
you want to do that i want you to know

1007
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,280
you can go in and out of mm but call it

1008
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,240
like it is

1009
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,839
i'm dabbling in mm

1010
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,919
i'm plant-based but i'm not medical

1011
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,359
medium plant-based i'm animal protein

1012
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,680
but i'm not medical medium animal

1013
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,320
protein i'm dabbling you know call it

1014
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,000
like it is it's okay it's all right

1015
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,599
don't say i did medical medium for three

1016
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,760
years but you didn't because you did all

1017
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,119
this acv and all this kombucha tea and

1018
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
all this nutritional yeast and all this

1019
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,200
vegan cheese and all this corn

1020
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,320
and then just and all this caffeine and

1021
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,599
all this chocolate and then you said

1022
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,800
you've been doing medical medium for

1023
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,160
three years and then you write a post

1024
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,200
saying i did medical medium for three

1025
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
years and i'm still not better

1026
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,359
and

1027
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,359
all that does is hurt people

1028
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,440
me i'll be fine

1029
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,560
but guess what somebody on mattress

1030
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,400
island

1031
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,240
just got tricked

1032
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
because that person wasn't doing mm but

1033
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
the person on mattress island that came

1034
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,839
across medical medium that needs a way

1035
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,160
out because she's been on with mattress

1036
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,760
island suffering she's 24 years old or

1037
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,680
28 years old and

1038
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,440
can't get a start in her life or his

1039
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,520
life and they're on mattress island or

1040
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,280
on couch island and they read somewhere

1041
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,800
someone said i did medical medium for

1042
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,160
three years and i didn't get better yeah

1043
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,160
i'd love to be a fly on the wall

1044
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,079
and that's the whole thing

1045
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,599
it's important to know love to be a fly

1046
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,880
on the wall

1047
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,640
using celery juice is one of medical

1048
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,560
medium tools

1049
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,079
it's one of them and it's an incredible

1050
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,079
place to start it's one powerful tool

1051
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,079
and if you're dabbling it's fine if you

1052
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
just do celery juice i said this for

1053
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
years

1054
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,880
if you can just do celery juice

1055
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,720
that

1056
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,040
that would be great

1057
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,800
if you can just do the heavy metal detox

1058
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,119
smoothie that would be great if you

1059
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
could just get rid of the gluten

1060
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,119
and the dairy that would be great if you

1061
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,599
can get rid of the eggs that would be

1062
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,680
great just if it's one step at a time

1063
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,040
i'm there with you guys on that i am

1064
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,440
but keep it straight when someone's

1065
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,200
talking about medical medium

1066
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,040
like yeah i dabbled

1067
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,640
i dabbled maybe i could have done a

1068
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,480
little bit more maybe i didn't read his

1069
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,040

can get is conventional celery

1092
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,960
non-organic then get it get conventional

1093
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,280
celery get it

1094
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,760
that's not a bad thing get it wash it

1095
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,000
and wash out the stalks okay

1096
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,079
take your fingers and get that water

1097
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,800
going put a little tiny bit of natural

1098
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,880
dish soap and soap up the water soap up

1099
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,480
the bowl i would get my bowl out right

1100
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,079
now and show you but my balls filled

1101
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
with all kinds of stuff you guys i was

1102
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,920
making a whole bunch of stuff earlier

1103
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,800
but

1104
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,640
just and then clean clean

1105
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,359
out this with your fingers and get it

1106
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,680
good yeah there's going to be residue

1107
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,599
but guess what meaning inside the cellar

1108
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,720
but guess what there's pesticide residue

1109
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,800
in every single conventional

1110
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
produce and here's the funny thing

1111
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,400
there's there's

1112
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
there's conventional

1113
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,960
pesticide

1114
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,599
residue in every single organic

1115
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,560
fruit and vegetable

1116
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,000
because all the organic fields were once

1117
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,400
conventional

1118
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,119
and then seven years past five years

1119
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
passed they started the farm they got

1120
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,520
the okay to be organic

1121
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,359
and the earth is loaded with pesticides

1122
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,480
it's okay

1123
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,800
because the celery juice outweighs that

1124
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,720
the celery juice will drive out and

1125
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
neutralize more pesticide out of your

1126
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,760
body and pull it out of your body even

1127
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,839
when it's conventional celery juice

1128
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,280
don't do hpp high pressure

1129
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,760
pasteurization i'm going to give you a

1130
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,359
really powerful tip right here do not

1131
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,800
buy

1132
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,960
celery juice in the bottle at the

1133
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,200
grocery store health food store

1134
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,960
that says it's fresh and raw but it

1135
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,720
wasn't freshly made

1136
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,000
it's got a date on it that lasts for

1137
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,920
quite a while because it's hpp

1138
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,839
total

1139
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
high pressure pasteurization destroys

1140
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,320
the celery juice

1141
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,920
so you're just getting ripped off

1142
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,520
i want mentioned earlier don't add

1143
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,240
anything to your celery juice no ice no

1144
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,520
lemon no water no no anything else drink

1145
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,760
it straight

1146
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,760
drink it straight

1147
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
you know many people i've seen on vegan

1148
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,800
diets have come to me for help even like

1149
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,800

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,400
high profile people celebrities whatever

1151
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920

1152
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
they're like they heard about vegans so

1153
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,520

1156
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,000

1158
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,960
every single morning and it was like

1159

miracles happening

1160
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,040
miracles happening even with bad vegan

1161
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,960
and bad plant-based diets i say bad

1162
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,079
because they're riddled in high fat

1163
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,079
apple cider vinegar vinegars in general

1164
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,200

they do

1172
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,480
but

1173
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,560
the vegan diet the plant-based diet

1174
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,400
doesn't mean we're doing it right and

1175
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,720
we're gonna get better or we're not

1176
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
gonna get sick it doesn't mean that

1177
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,599
and the animal protein diet is the same

1178
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,359
way

1179
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,680
same way

1180
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,280

1181
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,640
with their health more than ever before

1182
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,560
in our history

1183
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
mosquito sprays being dumped on us right

1184
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,480
now

1185
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,800
definitely everywhere just planes at

1186
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,839
night dump it all night every everywhere

1187
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,560
that's what happens they don't even

1188
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,680
forewarn people they don't tell anybody

1189
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,680
and

1190
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,680
chemtrails coming out of the sky right

1191
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,440
toxic heavy metal exposure all the time

1192
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,400
right old pharmaceuticals and our system

1193
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,520
all this stuff we're up against so much

1194
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,920
and

1195
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,760
so much stress too when you add it all

1196
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,680
up we need some serious fighting tools

1197
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,599
and i i'm not kidding about the medical

1198
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,160
device thing where i don't want to be in

1199
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,160

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,200
i said that if you're sick and you're

1269
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,720
chronically ill and you can't move the

1270
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,880
needle we got to pull the fats out

1271
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,160
someday even it's a little bit at a time

1272
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,680
let's get them out

1273
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,319
depends on where somebody's health is

1274
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,599
someone can have pathogens that can have

1275
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,760
two three different kinds of

1276
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,160
epstein-barr cytomegal cytomegalovirus

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,440
they could have that they can have a

1279
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,599
whole bunch of things going on in their

1280
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
system

1281
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,280
and

1282
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,280
pathogens toxins metals everybody has a

1283
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,680
different brew
