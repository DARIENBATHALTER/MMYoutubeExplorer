you're listening to the medical medium

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
radio show where each week I talk about

7
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,119
the most advanced healing information

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,199
and secrets about health much of which

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,960
is not found anywhere else and is De

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,239
ahead of what's out there now as I've

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,399
always said who has 10 or 20 years to

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,920
wait for answers to their illnesses life

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,399
is precious and there's no time to spare

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,239
let's get started now Today's Show is

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,840
about gene mutation the

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,640
mtfr gene mutation this is an important

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,600
show it's going to be an historic show

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,440
in many ways because what you're going

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,960
to hear is

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,440
mindblowing if you're a connoisseur of

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,479
genes or gene mutations mtfr gene

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,600
mutations and I'm not saying that it's

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,240
going to be a show with information

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,720
about genes and how they work and how

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,159
they're they're connected to us it's not

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,560
going to be there instead it's going to

27
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:23,040
be protecting you against Gene fraud

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,920
okay and that's something really it's

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
critical to understand Gene fraud and

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,920
what that means is things that are

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,159
created so you think your body is

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,320
destroying itself that your body is

33
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,360
attacking itself that your genes are

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,079
faulty that your genes are useless that

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,119
your genes are attacking you or or

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:47,079
melting down on you so that you don't

37
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,399
have a chance to heal and that's the

38
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,840
weakness that's thrown on us so if

39
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,240
you're a gene expert you hang on to your

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,520
seat you're either going to hate me

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,719

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,159
healing path too my healing path is it

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,000

speaking and talking but in the way that

92
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,840
you need the information you need so you

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,720
can heal and then tell others and how to

94
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,799

the first time on the show it all

98
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,280
started for me at age 4 when I heard a

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,680
voice perfectly clear it led me to the

100
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,759
diagnosis of my grandmother I've

101
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,840
dedicated my entire life um to helping

102
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,560
people tens of thousands of people get

103
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,160
the answers they need so that's more

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,800
about me I hear a voice that tells me

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,560
what's going on and and we're going to

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,680
go into the whole Gene thing right now

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,160
so the so let's start so fasten your

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,560
seat belt you know get ready

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,280
fasten that seat belt hold on hold on to

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,039
your seat because um this is a big deal

111
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,400
today and maybe some of you don't even

112
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,160
know about the gene mutation thing maybe

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
you know you haven't heard it or or

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,880
you're just done you're not aware of it

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,160
or anything like that but the MTHFR gene

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,720
mutation is taking the World by storm in

117
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,120
holistic medicine at this point and if I

118
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
go with the ride

119
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,759
and just you know hop on that ride hop

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
on that

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,919
Trend um it's going to do you an

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,520
injustice it really is you need to know

123
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,960
this so I'm going to explain where I sit

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,120
with this where it has its good place or

125
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,400
it's good points and where it's

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,639
completely backwards in a way that's not

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,720
good at all for you your well-being for

128
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,680
your children and for your family so

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,319
this is really important to understand

130
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,919
so see you know I'm not against every

131
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,639
Trend in fad that's you know that's not

132
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,360
it I mean look the celery juice Trend

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,080
that started from me and everybody's

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,080
doing now and it's going everywhere it's

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,199
just it's it's crossing the Earth right

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,880
now that's a trend that came from me

137
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,440
okay so yeah I'm not going to be against

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,440
the celery juice Trend because a you

139
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,560
know Spirit created it but there and I'm

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,319
not against other trends that are out

141
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
there too that someone else came up with

142
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,160
somehow or figured it out through Maybe

143
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,280
a scientific thing that then became

144
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,960
trendy I support a lot of different

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,800
Trends too but there's some that there's

146
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,880
there's no way it it deserves the

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,400
support the support from me it doesn't

148
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,039
one of the things that we got here is

149
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,319
this gene mutation

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,720
so what what is an Mt you know MTHFR

151
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,720
gene mutation it's the inability to

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,759
convert folate so that's the thing it's

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,599
the inability to convert folate that's

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,280
what you're going to hear out there so

155
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,479
when you look into it you dial it up on

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,120
your computer or you talk to a doctor or

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,560
practitioner it's going to be this

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,039
inability to convert fate or folic acid

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,800
you know into usable forms into a form

160
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,639
where the body can accept it and you

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
know that part alone has some Merit to

162
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,440
it but this I'm just going to give you

163
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,680
what's out there now a little bit and

164
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,800
you hey you could be an expert on this

165
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,919
and you know have all these you know

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:04,360
details that go along with all this but

167
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,199
so basically the the MTHFR Gene produces

168
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,520
an

169
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,039
enzyme okay so methylene Tetra hydrolate

170
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,120
that's the enzyme it produces so

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,599
scientifically that's what's been

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,400
discovered out there but I'm going to

173
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,479
tell you right now about something about

174
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:25,199
science okay science is

175
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,879
incredible when it comes down to hey you

176
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
break your leg I talked about that a

177
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,560
zillion times you're probably like okay

178
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,680
I've heard that before or you need a

179
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,680
heart transplant okay or you need

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
something else or your your gallbladder

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
explodes because it got highly infected

182
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
or stone got caught in there because

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,759
you're doing a gallbladder flush and you

184
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,039
flush the stone into the duct and now

185
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,360
you need your your gallbladder removed

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,280
hence is why I don't like the

187
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,440
gallbladder flushes by the way you guys

188
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,960
and so whatever it is that you know

189
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,879
Sciences we have great surgeons got

190
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,680
neurosurgeons you name it that can

191
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,319
remove aneurysms out of people's brains

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
with robots and and that's incredible

193
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,919
that's the part of science that I love

194
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,800
and there's there's plenty of it there's

195
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,159
a decent amount of it but then there's

196
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,680
chronic illness chronic illness massive

197
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,199
you know amount of space out there

198
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,960
complete mystery to science complete

199
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,800
mystery and and you know for real

200
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,000
mystery illness and anything you can tag

201
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,199
a name onto it I don't care what it is

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,879
tag a name onto it Celiac just so you

203
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,680
know that's still a medical mystery um

204
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,720
you know Hashimoto thyroiditis still a

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,560
medical mystery until I brought the

206
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,039
because I've been the first one to bring

207
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,560
out the truth that the Epstein bar

208
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,399
causes Hashim Modas and now people are

209
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,399
picking that up now and they don't they

210
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,839
don't say it came from me and whatever

211
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm seeing that out there out there and

212
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
fine you know as long as the information

213
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,040
gets out there it's incredible but the

214
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,160
point is is that there are all these

215
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,279
different chronic mystery illnesses with

216
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,800
no real truth to what's going on behind

217
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,360
any of them

218
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,600
and and I mean the list goes on colius

219
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,560
Myster illness that alone I mean you

220
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,000
know uh depression depression depression

221
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,320
is a mystery illness anxiety mystery

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,079
illness I mean especially when it comes

223
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,519
down to stuff like that and then you

224
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,360
know ra um lupus multiple sclerosis

225
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,480
still a mystery uh go on down the line

226
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,680
ALS still a mystery and you know you can

227
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,120
keep on going and keep on going so the

228
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,880
point is is that since chronic illness

229
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,519
is mystery illness and I dedicated the

230
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,640
medical medium book The First Medical

231
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,880
medium book to that um check that out if

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
you haven't seen it go check a book out

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,920
and and or pick one up or wherever you

234
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
can get one and you know you'll see

235
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,519
about how mystery and chronic illness

236
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
and how it's designed how there's labels

237
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,320
on things but technically the label

238
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,399
really isn't the answer um how we need

239
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,920
to deem these things mystery in order to

240
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,680
get real help and they won't nobody

241
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
won't the medical world won't medical

242
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
communities won't deem any of these

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,440
mystery illnesses because if they do

244
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,519
that then they'll just be showcasing how

245
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,279
they've been wrong the whole time um

246
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,640
with just putting labels on things and

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,000
that's it so and so where it falls in

248
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,519
here's what I'm talking about now got

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,720
all this chronic illness out there it's

250
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,120
all mysterious it's not mysterious here

251
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,600
it's not mysterious here and if you're

252
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,680
someone who just logged on to the show

253
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,720
and you don't know you don't know me or

254
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,320
anything like that what's going on

255
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,600
you're going to think oh so this guy has

256
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,200
all the answers big Mr medical medium

257
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,839
has all the answers here in this show

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,519
but all the science and all the world

259
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,880
doesn't have it it's not me that knows

260
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,839
that it's a source that I've been given

261
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,079
as a gift to receive whether you like it

262
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,200
or not I've helped tens of thousands of

263
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,560
people get to where they need to be

264
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
regardless so you know putting this

265
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,440
aside though putting this aside okay

266
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,839
science doesn't have the answers to why

267
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
mommies can't get out of bed and take

268
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,120
care of their children to why people

269
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,760
can't walk down the street because they

270
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,600
got aches and pains but all these

271
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,320
different things science does not cover

272
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,399
any of that I don't care what anybody

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,519
says I've seen the suffering I've seen

274
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,800
what people have gone through I see it

275
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,959
every day and things have to be done and

276
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,959
we need real information from real

277
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,000
sources so the whole point about The

278
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,760
Chronic and mystery illness is because

279
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,240
there's no answers we get blamed the

280
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,040
blame game okay the blame game yes

281
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,639
talking about it again I might have

282
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
talked about it in the last show might

283
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,000
have talked talked about a little bit in

284
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,000
the last show before that but here's

285
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,200
where it really kicks in really kicks in

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
so when you get told you have an

287
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,000
autoimmune

288
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
disease you're told that your body is

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,880
attacking itself you've heard this from

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
me here's how it works we walk into the

291
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,320
the doctor's office they don't know no

292
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,079
one knows what's really wrong with

293
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,120
anybody they don't know what's causing

294
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,399
Hashimoto that's just a quick example

295
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
because you know what so many people

296
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,399
have thyroid problems and so it's it's

297
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,079
easy to understand and we get hold their

298
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,240
body is attacking itself the blame

299
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,760
gamees going on okay this is one of the

300
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,320
great mistakes I talk about but there's

301
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,199
blame another blame game and it's a bad

302
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,360
one it's really bad it's the genan blame

303
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:21,680
game it's a losers game everybody walks

304
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,320
away a loser on this one it's no fun

305
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,720
it's it's

306
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,600
insulting insulting terribly insulting

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
it's

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,240
demeaning it's the gening because of

309
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,600
jees you name it it is what it is and

310
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,519
what the what I'm trying to say is you

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,199
got something wrong with you and you got

312
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,360
some bad jeans you got some rotten jeans

313
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,920
you got some faulty jeans your jeans

314
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,040
don't work that's your problem you're

315
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,880
sick because you got bad jeans over

316
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
there that person over there is healthy

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,519
cuz they got good jeans you got bad

318
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,279
jeans cuz you feel like

319
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,440
crap okay that person's overweight oh

320
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,079
they got bad genes that person you know

321
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,720
has all kinds of problems they got bad

322
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,839
genes that's where it's going because it

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
has to go there because medical research

324
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,720
and medical science whether anybody

325
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,040
likes it or not I'm just going to tell

326
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,920
you right now doesn't have the answers

327
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,480
it doesn't have the

328
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,839
answers

329
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,800
90% of Health and Wellness is mysterious

330
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,560
it's

331
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,920
mystery that's the bottom line and where

332
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,760
the gene mutation comes in this is where

333
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,440
you got to be careful you get sucked

334
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,399
into the G mutation you're going to get

335
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,560
in trouble big trouble because you're

336
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,480
going to lose you got to be careful and

337
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm saying that now now it's pretty bold

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,519
to go against a trend that's catching on

339
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,160
like lightning out there lightning it's

340
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,480
it's so so yeah so I'm being pretty bold

341
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,800
about this but I'm going to put my butt

342
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,360
on the firing line to do everything I

343
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,279
can to protect you your children and

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
your well-being that's the bottom line

345
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,160
and what you're going to hear is going

346
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,959
to make sense it's going to make a lot

347
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,959
of sense is what you're going to hear as

348
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,440
we go through this show this is a very

349
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,120
important show just as important as the

350
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,360
lime disease show just as important as

351
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,320
you know as as other shows that have

352
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,040
done and maybe even more important okay

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,959
um so let's let's run into it a little

354
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,000
bit so science is telling us is

355
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,000
dictating to us right now that our genes

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,839
become

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,680
mutated and they can't produce enzymes

358
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,920
that are

359
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,519
needed and these enzymes help you know

360
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,120
with glutathion production they help

361
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,680
with folate and folic acid um

362
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,519
involvement as far as easily

363
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,399
assimilating into the body and and it

364
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,199
involves chemical compounds as well so

365
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,839
we're told that if you have the gene

366
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,079
mutation whatever variety of gene

367
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
mutation you might have there's

368
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,800
different m th hfrg mutations now there

369
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,880
was used to be just one now there's two

370
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,399
now there's three and I'm sure there'll

371
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,199
be 10 more because you know why science

372
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,600
doesn't know what it's doing in this

373
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,120
it's just it it's just moving in a in a

374
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,000
path that's not a good place now good

375
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,759
meaning practitioners and

376
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
doctors is they're you know they're for

377
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,320
you they're for you they're looking out

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,839
for you they're looking after you they

379
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,320
care about you just like I care about

380
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,560
you I'm sure they do you know that's the

381
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,519
whole point we go into this because we

382
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,959
care and that's what it's about but it's

383
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:39,040
easy for a practitioner to get LED down

384
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,240
this path of genes because it makes so

385
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,560
much sense that that much must be what's

386
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,759
behind you being sick and and whoever's

387
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,639
sick it's behind it so it's easy to go

388
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,519
right down that

389
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,959
path and and and head there and be like

390
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,440
okay yeah jeans heck yeah why not we're

391
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,440
made up of jeans look at all the

392
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,880
hereditary traits we have

393
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,319
but the genan blame game is a tricky one

394
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,480
it's the trickiest of all because when

395
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,720
you have a child and your child takes on

396
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,959
hereditary traits you can't ignore the

397
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,240
fact that genes are not playing a role

398
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,880
when you have some similarities to your

399
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,360
forefather to your mother your father to

400
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,120
your grandfather it wins the case

401
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,000
immediately that jeans have to be while

402
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,120
you're sick it wins the Case Case Closed

403
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,040
bam

404
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,480
because you get it it's

405
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,959
inescapable you can't get away from the

406
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,160
fact that your mother or your father or

407
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:46,800
your grandfather looks the same or maybe

408
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,519
even feels the same or maybe even has a

409
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,720
symptom that's the same regardless it's

410
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:58,920
it's impossible to ignore so this is by

411
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,360
far one of the most evil miscon

412
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,480
inceptions there has to be because no

413
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,160
matter what and no matter probably what

414
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,120
I say here it's just easy to fall into

415
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,880
this

416
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,120
pit what this means is generations to

417
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,559
come are going to all think no matter

418
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,360
what their chronic illnesses are Gene

419
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,880
related and that medical research and

420
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,919
medical science better be up on the

421
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,640
genes and better be working to help our

422
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,799
genes and money and billions of dollars

423
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,520
has to go into genan Jean genan Jean

424
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,960
genes yep that's right and guess what

425
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,640
people are not only going to be sick

426
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,200
they're going to be sicker in the future

427
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,600
and that's why this is by far one of the

428
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,440
worst so the point is how do we escape

429
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,720
this and what do we do okay we're filled

430
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,280
with genes they have their purposes

431
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,600
absolutely they have their purpose they

432
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,840
do genes are involved in our body in so

433
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,760
many different

434
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,120
ways but your

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,400
Gene can't become

436
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:02,600
mutated it can't become mutated

437
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,880
it's not truly a real mutation if you've

438
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:11,919
been diagnosed with an mthf FRG mutation

439
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:15,400
it's technically not a real gene

440
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,039
mutation even if the gene is

441
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,559
under problems of some kind meaning

442
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:25,559
under some kind of um contaminant some

443
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,720
kind of chemical some kind of pollutants

444
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,000
creating a gene to not function function

445
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,240
is good it's not technically mutated so

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,240
you need to understand this so when you

447
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,600
get diagnosed with MTHFR gene mutation

448
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,440
it's not you don't have a gene you don't

449
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,360
have a gene that's mutated you don't you

450
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,039
don't have a gene that's not working in

451
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:50,120
fact when it comes down to mfrg mutation

452
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:52,440
the gene isn't even

453
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,919
problematic there's something else

454
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:01,240
triggering off the faulty MTHFR gene

455
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:04,000
mutation test tests the faulty

456
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,360
tests that's what's going on there the

457
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,640
mthf FRG mutation tests are not accurate

458
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,280
they're inaccurate to begin with okay so

459
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,600
that's what's going on there doesn't

460
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,320
mean you don't have to you doesn't mean

461
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,360
you don't stop and get one I mean you

462
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,360
can still get your G mutation test the

463
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,640
whole bit but I'm trying to let you know

464
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,000
they're not

465
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,840
Ironclad not Ironclad at all and if you

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,880
do ring up a gene mutation test gets

467
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,039
rung up positive I'm going to tell you

468
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,280
what's going on so we can really cut

469
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,559
into it so we have methylation problems

470
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,799
that's the real part we have inabilities

471
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,480
inability to methylate methylate is

472
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,840
conversion it's all about conversion

473
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,640
inside the body that's what methylation

474
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,400
is it's all about conversion uh breaking

475
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,559
down chemicals into smaller chemicals

476
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
breaking down smaller chemicals into

477
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,840
smaller chemicals breaking down those

478
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,600
smaller chemicals into smaller chemicals

479
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,960
it goes on and on and on if you look

480
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,200
into methylation or you look into the G

481
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,280
mutation out there on the trendy stuff

482
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,159
that's trending they'll just kind of you

483
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,880
know cut it clear they'll say well you

484
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,880
know it's an enzyme and then they'll say

485
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,880
you know this enzyme um you know um this

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,720
enzyme is involved with methylene

487
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,159
another enzyme and that they bind on

488
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
together they break down folate they

489
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,840
break down folic acid and it it's pretty

490
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,159
much where it stops but

491
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,760
what's really happening is we have

492
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,840
chemical breakdowns in the body that

493
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,520
science is so far away that it would

494
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,240
take a thousand years we're talking

495
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,760
about it doesn't stop at chemicals

496
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,000
breaking down and converting into more a

497
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,320
smaller chemicals or more easily viable

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,720
chemicals it keeps on going the mystery

499
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,360
of what our body does how many chemicals

500
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,960
we have is is unbelievable and I'm going

501
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,960
to talk about something here something

502
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,960
very important okay okay medical science

503
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:09,440
and research only believes the liver is

504
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,440
responsible for anywhere from 400 to 500

505
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,080
chemical uses or chemical

506
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,480
responsibilities okay chemical

507
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,400
responsibilities in your body to do

508
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,760
things to do things to keep you alive

509
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,039
and well the liver has thousands of

510
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,440
chemical

511
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,240
responsibilities thousands that haven't

512
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,159
even been discovered yet and these

513
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,159
thousands of responsibilities play into

514
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,600
methylation which is still in its baby

515
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,640
stage of understanding but the problem

516
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,840
is it sends you down the direction that

517
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,720
your Gene is mutated and that's the

518
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,279
problem the problem with that is the

519
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,080
real issue in your health is not being

520
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,720
seen whatsoever not being seen not being

521
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,400
understood but then you might get a

522
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,279
diagnosed well you got this methylation

523
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,480
issue this MTHFR gen mutation issue you

524
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:03,480
got that you're me not methylating fine

525
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,919
and and you know youve got some candida

526
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,440
you may have this oh you've been

527
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,640
diagnosed with lime you got a little bit

528
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,960
borderline lime it's a mess it's a hot

529
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,440
mess out there so let's talk about how

530
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,600
it works what what creates the test the

531
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,279
triggers off the test to begin with what

532
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:26,000
triggers it off is inflammation the

533
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:30,400
MTHFR G mutation test is just as good as

534
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,559
an Ana anti- nuclear antibody test just

535
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,799
as good as that test it's just as good

536
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:40,600
as a C-reactive protein test they're

537
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:43,840
just basic inflammatory marker tests but

538
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:49,360
the mthf FRG mutation test is under the

539
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,080
guce of a gene test it's just another

540
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,559
basic you got some inflammation

541
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,279
throughout your entire

542
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,120
body test that's what it is just just so

543
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:03,039
you know so where does this lead this

544
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,559
leads

545
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,360
to

546
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,200
misdiagnosis this leads to

547
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,080
misinformation less information for our

548
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,440
health and well-being kind of like the

549
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,840
anti-nuclear antigen test antibody test

550
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,200
the Ana test that test for

551
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,120
Lupus tells you if you have Lupus first

552
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,400
of all it doesn't tell you if you have

553
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,159
Lupus it's just another inflammation

554
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:32,520
test for mystery illness or mystery

555
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,520
issues the mthf FRG mutation test should

556
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,360
just be a tool to show that yes there's

557
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,520
something else wrong with you or going

558
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,400
on with you but it should not be

559
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,520
deciphering or defining you and saying

560
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,279
that you have a gene mutation or that

561
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,640
your child has a gene

562
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,400
mutation it's so detrimental to your

563
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,760
health and well-being you have to back

564
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,120
out of that and say okay you know what I

565
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,159
don't have a gene mutation it's not

566
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,840
possible what I have though is a marker

567
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,080
that's telling me something else is

568
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,679
going on and that's the part where I'm

569
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,039
okay about the test itself because the

570
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,919
test is a basic inflammatory test just

571
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:17,559
like many of the other ones that get a

572
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,159
tag and get a label so if you do or you

573
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,559
have been diagnosed with MTHFR gene

574
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,080
mutation one of the gene mutations and

575
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,320
you have been diagnosed and you have

576
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,120
that test has been done and you've been

577
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,159
told this is what's going on what you

578
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,559
have to do is it's okay it's okay you

579
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,919
just have to know your Gene's not

580
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,080
mutated you have to know that

581
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,760
immediately you don't have a gene

582
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,120
dysfunction but you have to realize the

583
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,000
test is not really accurate it's in its

584
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,640
baby stages I mean that you give it 20

585
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,399
years and you watch where that test is

586
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
and you have to realize it's just a

587
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,440
marker that's showing that you have

588
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,799
something else going on so that's how

589
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,880
you have have to see it and this is

590
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:05,120
where I'm supportive of the gene

591
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,559
mutation test it really they should just

592
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,559
change the name of it they should change

593
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:13,799
the name of it and get out of the whole

594
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,520
Gene blame game it's a dangerous game so

595
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,720
here's the deal you go to the doctor

596
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,279
you're not feeling good whether you're

597
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,520
not feeling good or not people get the

598
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,880
test and it rings off and they're

599
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,880
feeling fine but you go to the doctor

600
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,279
you get the test or your

601
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,799
practitioner test comes up positive that

602
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,600
you got the MTHFR gene mutation okay

603
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,520
what you have to realize right away

604
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,880
something else is going on there's

605
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,480
something happening inside the body and

606
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,440
let me tell you what's happening and

607
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,760
where it is all gene

608
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
mutations meaning the test itself

609
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,799
providing somebody with the

610
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,880
misinformation of having a gene

611
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,960
mutation all these lead to a

612
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,720
dysfunctional problem in the liver

613
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,840
that's where it's all going on it's the

614
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,720
liver second part is the intestinal

615
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:08,320
tract but the liver is where the trouble

616
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,159
lies see what triggers off the

617
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,279
inflammation that then determines if you

618
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:18,279
have an mthf FRG mutation what triggers

619
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:22,399
all of this off is byproduct byproduct

620
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:25,440
coming out of the liver floating in the

621
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,600
bloodstream wreaking havoc causing

622
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,640
homocysteine levels to rise or to fall

623
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,960
or become useless it's it's these these

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,120
other chemicals these toxins they're

625
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,559
floating around the bloodstream from the

626
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:44,880
liver from sources in combinations of

627
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:47,880
pathogens viruses inside the liver

628
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,760
viruses or heavy metals or both

629
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,559
technically it really is both most cases

630
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,760
of having heavy metals inside the liver

631
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,559
having a lot of byproduct a lot of slug

632
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,399
sludge a lot of Gunk a lot of junk

633
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,120
inside that

634
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:09,159
liver from pathogens that are producing

635
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,720
that also things that the liver have

636
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:15,399
collected over the years like the toxic

637
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,240
heavy metals and that junk and garbage

638
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:21,840
starts making the liver less efficient

639
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,159
stops letting it function as good stops

640
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,880
it from cleaning your blood when you get

641
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:32,279
your F Mt mthf R gene mutation test and

642
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,279
it comes up positive you got dirty blood

643
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,880
that's what it means it doesn't mean you

644
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,840
have a faulty Gene it means you have a

645
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:45,960
you have dirty blood it means your dirty

646
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:49,279
blood is preventing folate or folic acid

647
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,720
from converting methylating being usable

648
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,440
by the body so here's where the parts

649
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,720
more than true there's a methylation

650
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,679
issue correct I'm not against the

651
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,760
methylation issue I've been talking

652
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:09,240
about methylation for 30

653
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:12,320
years so that's how long it's been and

654
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,480
so I'm totally for it because that's

655
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,440
where it lies that's where the truth

656
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,679
holds it holds in there it's not that

657
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,200
you have a g

658
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:26,159
mutation but you do have a methylation

659
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,120
problem so what the practitioner and the

660
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,039
doctor is discovering is you do have a

661
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,559
methylation problem but it's under the G

662
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,360
it's under the hidden

663
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,480
roof you know that dark pit of it's your

664
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,200
Gene causing all this

665
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,760
trouble and guess what if your Gene's

666
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,720
causing all the trouble you can't fix

667
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,519
that you can't just fix that Gene if

668
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,000
your Gene's causing all the

669
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,320
trouble but here's the irony you fix

670
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,360
somebody's methylation problem and the

671
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,080
test doesn't ring off off anymore so

672
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,799
when you fix somebody's methylation

673
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,559
issue where they're methylating their

674
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,200
liver is getting better their blood

675
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:13,120
isn't dirty they don't trigger off the

676
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,640
gene mutation test anymore isn't that

677
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,480
interesting one week that test rings off

678
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,000
that you got the you got two two

679
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,000
versions of G mutations one one week

680
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,480
that test rings off that you're it shows

681
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,440
you got this mthf FRG mutation and it's

682
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
really bad

683
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,600
and then you start methylating

684
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,519
again and you start fixing the problem

685
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,039
that's creating the dirty

686
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,519
blood and that's inside the

687
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,320
liver and guess what that test goes away

688
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,440
the Tex test goes away I know

689
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,519
practitioners that are baffled because

690
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,480
because the person did the right thing

691
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,799
not offered by the practitioner but did

692
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,440
the right thing by finding and sourcing

693
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,640
the right information to to heal a meth

694
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,679
a problem like the adino silab balamin

695
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,559
we talk about like the B12 we talk about

696
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,399
you guys and really creating the you

697
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,840
know creating methylation in the body

698
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,279
cleaning up the liver getting the viral

699
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,559
load down and then the test goes away

700
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,000
and then literally the practitioner

701
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,760
scratching the head like this is

702
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,440
impossible this you know maybe the blood

703
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,399
was switched to the lab maybe the blood

704
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,919
was switched here maybe you know they

705
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:26,600
can't understand how it's possible you

706
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,679
lose the tag the label it's possible

707
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,880
because once you fix the real issue you

708
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,279
lose that inflammation the inflammation

709
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,880
disappears and it won't trigger off the

710
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,080
gene mutation

711
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,440
test so just recap a little bit gene

712
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,440
mutation test number one is really just

713
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,480
an inflammatory test with a fancy name

714
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,120
blaming your

715
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,200
jeans I'm just being straightforward now

716
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,880
if you're a practitioner you're like

717
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,159
that's not true I know how the test

718
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,039
works it's a real Gene we're looking at

719
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,519
no no no no no no yeah that part yeah

720
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:01,360
you're looking at that you're looking at

721
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,080
a real Gene but the test still comes up

722
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,880
wrong it's how look you can name you can

723
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,440
take any test and name it anything you

724
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,120
want in any way capacity possible but

725
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,360
it's going to end up being in many cases

726
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,440
an inflammatory test and this is a new

727
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,200
version of showcasing inflammation in

728
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,200
the body yeah rocking the B rocking the

729
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,960
you know rocking the boat when it comes

730
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,600
down to homosysteine

731
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,279
and rocking the boat in

732
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,559
methylation but nevertheless it's an

733
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,840
inflammatory marker that's what it is

734
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,440
just like I've talked about all the Lyme

735
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,200
disease tests all these years why do you

736
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,360
think Lyme disease testing is oh your

737
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,279
borderline it's either you have the

738
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,919
pathogen or you don't but for some

739
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,320
reason we're told oh but it's borderline

740
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,200
so yeah we would say you do because it's

741
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,600
borderline what's borderline you either

742
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,679
you either have it or you don't the

743
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,360
reason why it's borderline because it's

744
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,159
an inflammation test another version of

745
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,399
an inflammation test you listen to the

746
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,240
lime show you I think I talk about it

747
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,880
there and uh and I'll do another another

748
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,519
lime show in the future what you're

749
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,000
going to find anybody who's viral and I

750
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,519
talked about this Lyme disease is viral

751
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,279
the reason why I'm mentioning this it's

752
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,720
important to know Lyme disease is viral

753
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,720
not bacterial at read if this is the

754
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,519
first time hopping on the show you know

755
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,039
hopping into the show read the book

756
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,519
medical medium read the lime chapter but

757
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:29,120
same thing with ra it's viral same thing

758
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,519
with multiple sclerosis that's viral you

759
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,480
can go on and on and on and all these

760
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,039
different illnesses that we have there's

761
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,519
probably hundred I can name maybe even

762
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,880
200 but it would just drive you nuts if

763
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,840
I sat here naming a list of 200

764
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,000
illnesses in these 200

765
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,080
illnesses understand that viruses play a

766
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,240
role and those

767
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,080
viruses sit inside the liver muck it up

768
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,480
whether you feel good or you don't feel

769
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,519
good releasing poison and toxin or

770
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,679
filling up toxins in the liver so when

771
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
you're diagnosed with Lyme disease

772
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,120
you're going to have an mthf FRG

773
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,679
mutation everybody with lime now is

774
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,000
getting the Mt MTHFR G mutation test now

775
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,399
and they're all coming up positive

776
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,080
because it's viral issues in the liver

777
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:25,679
causing dirty blood and triggering off

778
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,679
the mtfr gene mutation test so that you

779
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,240
get diagnosed with a G

780
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,639
issue anybody with multiple sclerosis

781
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,679
now they're getting they're they're

782
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:38,039
saying they they got the mthf FRG

783
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:41,440
mutation everybody with lupus MTHFR G

784
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,000
mutation see what's happening here is

785
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
when you have a viral condition that's

786
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,360
causing lupus like the Epstein bar virus

787
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,679
that causes lupus they talk about it in

788
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,120
the book or you got you know or you got

789
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,799
the multiple sclerosis or a different

790
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,360
variet variety of Epstein bar causing Ms

791
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,159
whatever it is or Lyme disease where

792
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,960
it's hhv6 HH B7 or shingles or the

793
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,519
Epstein bar varieties or multiple

794
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,080
varieties of all these creating Lyme

795
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,960
disease whatever it is you're going to

796
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,000
see mthf FRG mutation eventually come up

797
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,359
and you're going to see methylation

798
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,960
issues the methylation issues homo homoy

799
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:21,079
issues are because the liver gets

800
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:25,040
clogged up clouded up filled the toxins

801
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:28,159
from having to deal with viral issues

802
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,159
and this flood of toxins viral viral

803
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,599
bodies viral casings spets that actually

804
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,200
are viral because casings of viruses

805
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:41,520
look like spyit you name it all of this

806
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,560
stuff dumps into the bloodstream along

807
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,079
with neurotoxins Dermot toxins that go

808
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,839
to the skin and create eczema psoriasis

809
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,879
all of this dumps into the bloodstream

810
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,760
floats

811
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,240
around and triggers off the MTHFR gene

812
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,679
mutation test and then you're told you

813
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,160
have a mutated Gene which doesn't help

814
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,760
you you heal from Lyme disease it

815
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,599
doesn't help you heal from Ms it doesn't

816
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,400
help you heal from eximus risis it

817
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,079
doesn't help you heal from SAR cardosis

818
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,640
it doesn't help you heal from you know

819
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:13,400
uh colitis or whatever it is it doesn't

820
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,720
help you heal to think and that you have

821
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,160
a gene mutation and if you think that

822
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,680
that's not true you're wrong it sits in

823
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,280
the back of the Mind in a subconscious

824
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:29,400
place that your jeans suck and it eats

825
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,280
away at the immune system so you got to

826
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,720
flip the switch now you got to know that

827
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,640
you have no gene

828
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,440
mutation you got to flip it and know you

829
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,040
don't have a gene mutation but what you

830
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,599
have is a methylation problem and that's

831
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,280
where the gene mutation test or the

832
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,280
philosophy or the theory because it's

833
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,160
all theoretical just so you know it's

834
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,920
all you know just know that there is

835
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,960
though a methylation issue cuz when that

836
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,960
liver gets clogged up and it gets dirty

837
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,720
and the blood gets get dirty and all

838
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,839
that's going on and stuff's flooding

839
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,240
into the bloodstream and into the

840
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:07,200
intestinal tract and clouding it up and

841
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,160
you're not eating the right foods and

842
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,280
that's elevating more inflammation and

843
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,560
feeding more pathogens and whatever's

844
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,880
going on just know methylation is not

845
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,119
going to go good you're going to get

846
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,839
minimum methylation minimum

847
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,400
conversions minimum conversions of

848
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,400
important chemicals and chemical

849
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,920
compounds and phytochemicals that come

850
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,960
through from food and come from all the

851
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,640
things that we involve come from the Sun

852
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,359
it come from food Sun clean

853
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,920
water and we're going to we're not going

854
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:47,720
to get the methylation

855
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,560
needed and there's this little spot I

856
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:54,040
talk about a lot it's in the colon It's

857
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,800
the eloel the Elum it's right there in

858
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,400
the Elum it's a little spot right right

859
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,960
after your small intestinal track and

860
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,920
right before your colon that spot has

861
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,760
probiotics called elevated biotics from

862
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,880
when you eat an apple you picked off a

863
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,480
tree not an apple you just get in the

864
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,119
supermarket that's been sitting there

865
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,839
waxed I'm talking about when you when

866
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,280
you that one time in your life you went

867
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:17,760
to an apple orchard because you went to

868
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,760
go pick some apples and drink a little

869
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,520
fresh apple cider that has these

870
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,720
elevated biotics in it it's a

871
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,040
microorganism that helps you methylate

872
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,640
that produces B12 when you pick a little

873
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,880
piece of kale out of the

874
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,440
garden that

875
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,160
produces B12 because it has

876
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,520
microorganisms that get to the Elum this

877
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,880
little section after your in small

878
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,480
intestinal

879
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,640
tract so methylation is a big deal we

880
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,200
got to clean up the liver we have to get

881
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,520
the diet right we have to lower any kind

882
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,760
of viral issues if you have a gene

883
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,359
mutation test that comes back positive

884
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,720
and your doctor says you're not

885
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,480
methylating then you better go antiviral

886
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,520
and talk to your doctor tell your

887
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,960
practitioner say look that means you

888
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,160
know I heard from Anthony that means

889
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,720
that I got low levels of viral issue

890
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,359
maybe in the liver that's what's causing

891
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,240
some of my symptoms my fatigue my eggs

892
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:19,680
and pains my Hashimoto and I got this

893
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:23,119
low level of viral you know viral um

894
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,560
activity going on making my blood toxic

895
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:30,640
and maybe that's why I don't detox good

896
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,359
because what the G mutation test leads

897
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,040
to as a practitioner then teaching

898
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,079
people you know hey it means you can't

899
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,440
detox you have no ability to detox your

900
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,880
homocysteine is all messed up your your

901
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,160
you know all this stuff is going on and

902
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,440
you can't detox you're not

903
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,880
detoxing because you're toxic because

904
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,359
you have a viral issue creating toxins

905
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,440
weakening the liver so that conversions

906
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,920
don't happen back to the liver liver is

907
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,599
responsible for thousands thousands of

908
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,640
of of of um of chemical activities

909
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,560
chemical

910
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,079
procedures okay chemical

911
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,800
responsibilities the liver is

912
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,720
responsible and and in this

913
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:18,359
responsibility Factor all this going

914
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,200
on is the breaking down of chemicals to

915
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,119
chemicals to chemicals to chemicals

916
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,040
meaning being used so that Amino and and

917
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
and the production of amino acids and

918
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,400
the breakdown and the combin ining of

919
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,359
aminos and the combining of aminos with

920
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,040
other chemicals all this is done in the

921
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:40,040
liver it's one of the most important

922
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,160
places there is and it's responsible for

923
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,720
methylation so if you got a viral thing

924
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,000
in the liver if you've had chronic

925
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,440
fatigue you got the Epstein bar in the

926
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,200
liver if you got Hashimoto you got the

927
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,760
Epstein bar in the liver you're

928
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,680
eventually going to end up with a gene

929
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,960
mutation diagnosis which will be in

930
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,839
accurate the only accurate part is is

931
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:07,359
that yes your methylation has dropped

932
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,160
your ability to methylate and to to you

933
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,400
know and to combine the folate and the

934
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,160
folic acid mean with other chemicals and

935
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,319
break them down so they're usable is

936
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,960
diminishing that part is correct that's

937
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,760
why a big part of the whole methylation

938
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,560
thing and the g mutations I

939
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,079
like but it's still got holes in it that

940
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:35,200
we're covering all in here today so you

941
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,920
know the conversion of homocysteine to

942
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,079
um to methionine okay that

943
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,560
conversion is something that gets

944
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,400
interfered with when you can't methylate

945
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,720
so your homocysteine levels can rise the

946
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,720
conversion is not there once again from

947
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,400
the liver being clogged up whether

948
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,920
you're overweight whether you're

949
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,359
underweight

950
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,960
whether you feel good whether you don't

951
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:06,000
whether your child's diagnosed with the

952
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,040
G mutation and you know feels fine in

953
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,119
the moment and then you think your child

954
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,520
has a gene mutation it means the liver

955
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,200
is showcasing signs of some wear and

956
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:19,280
tear whether it's a really early on

957
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,720
which happens all the time or later on

958
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,079
and that will give you the mfrg mutation

959
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,839
but like I said before if you've been

960
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,040
diagnosed with any chronic illness

961
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:28,640
that's still a mystery and a mystery to

962
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,680
Alternative doctors to and alternative

963
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,520
medicine still a mystery and you're

964
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,960
diagnosed all these different labels

965
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,400
many of them which we talked about

966
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,960
already then chances are you'll

967
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,079
eventually get that MTHFR mutation test

968
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,119
and be and be told you have

969
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,520
that but really what's happening is yes

970
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,200
you have things going on with your

971
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,440
health and that your health is having

972
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,720
you know you're struggling with the

973
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,599
methylation process because of the dirty

974
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,280
blood the detoxic detoxification issue

975
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,880
from having dirty blood and the liver

976
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,079
not being able to perform what it needs

977
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,160
to perform so the blood gets toxic and

978
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:10,520
dirty and you end up with the gene

979
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,079
mutation test so what do we do being a

980
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,280
positive so what do we do we can turn

981
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,880
this around you can change this you can

982
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,440
get yourself

983
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,760
better and clean this up so that when

984
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,319
you go and get your mthf FRG mutation

985
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,440
test you can get rid of the positive on

986
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:29,839
that test and blow the doctor or

987
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,839
practitioner's

988
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,800
mind you can because what it's going to

989
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:37,599
mean is you're going to lower your

990
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,200
inflammation so it doesn't trigger off

991
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:45,559
the faulty test that was created another

992
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,520
test that's really not accurate I mean

993
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,480
it showcases something it showcases a

994
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,559
little a little bit of elevation of

995
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,400
inflammation so it's accurate on that

996
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,160
level it showcases that leads to a

997
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,640
methylation problem on that level so

998
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,480
what can we do well first of all go

999
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,760
antiviral that's the first thing get

1000
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,000
your zinc up to par it's the first thing

1001
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,400
you want to do get your zinc up the par

1002
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,800
start drinking some th tea a little bit

1003
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,640
of thme tea get some oregano capsules

1004
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,200
okay so you can find you know you can

1005
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,599
find any of this stuff also on on uh you

1006
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,680
know I have a little um directory of all

1007
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,599
these things you can find so people know

1008
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,160
the Best Brands just go to medical

1009
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,319
medium.com and and look for this stuff

1010
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,839
we don't sell it okay so we don't have a

1011
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,040
store where we're selling anything but

1012
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,200
it's there so you don't buy the zinc

1013
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,440
that has citric acid so you burn your

1014
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,200
stomach and and create an

1015
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,440
ulcer okay so we so that doesn't happen

1016
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,200
all right so you don't buy the the

1017
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,800
tincture that has corn grain alcohol in

1018
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,680
it so you feed another bacteria or feed

1019
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,960
some kind of sibo problem or whatever it

1020
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,119
is so you know you want the right

1021
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,920
supplements so you do the oregano oil

1022
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,200
capsules that's important Olive Leaf you

1023
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,160
want to bring a little olive leaf in

1024
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,520
cat's claw that's another great one you

1025
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,520
want to have the right

1026
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,880
zinc bring in the zinc the supplement

1027
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,160
methylfolate this is the most critical

1028
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,280
part of methylation right here but yeah

1029
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,559
you might know about it your

1030
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,319
practitioner offers it with a

1031
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,040
methylation problem or a g mutation

1032
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:21,960
issue they offer the methylfolate but it

1033
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,440
won't work unless your B12 supplement

1034
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,680
has adoil cobalamin in it you won't find

1035
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,839
that information anywhere else but here

1036
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,680
that's how you methylate regardless of

1037
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:32,680
your liver condition or anything else or

1038
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,079
the dirty blood fixed up and all that

1039
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,079
better you still can methylate when you

1040
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,960
combine these two so that's the

1041
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,720
important part all the other b12's never

1042
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,920
have adinos Sil cobalamin in it so

1043
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,680
methylation still doesn't occur when

1044
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,839
someone has a problem and you want

1045
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,960
vitamin C because vitamin C helps you

1046
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:53,599
detox like it gets the poisons out of

1047
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,079
the blood so they get

1048
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,880
removed and pushed on Down the Line

1049
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,040
so you want vitamin C and enough vitamin

1050
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:08,000
C so that's

1051
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:12,520
important so keep that in your regime um

1052
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,040
line that's a big deal line lowers viral

1053
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,280
loads viral loads are responsible for

1054
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,920
methylation issues viral loads are

1055
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,119
responsible for problems dirty blood the

1056
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,240
liver not working good so get the

1057
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,720
lysine so that's a great one to bring in

1058
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,280
foods get out the eggs get out the dairy

1059
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,160
get out the wheat okay and you'll know

1060
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,680
you go to your alternative practitioner

1061
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,119
you go to your um holistic

1062
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:41,119
practitioner and you're going to be told

1063
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,680
to get off the weak gluten of course

1064
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,720
you're going to be told to get off maybe

1065
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,800
some dairy products so you want to get

1066
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,280
off of those that's really

1067
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,920
important so when it comes down to the

1068
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,240
foods you want less fat in the foods

1069
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,920
this is really important so you don't

1070
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,400
want the dairy okay you don't want the

1071
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,200
you know you don't want the eggs in

1072
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,880
there you don't want foods that have

1073
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,640
real high fat if you're a meat eater

1074
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,240
lower the fats by lowering the amount of

1075
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,680
meat you're eating because we're talking

1076
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,119
about it's your liver and your liver is

1077
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,680
creating the methylation problem it's

1078
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,680
creating the mthf FRG mutation problem

1079
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,440
that means the more fat in your liver

1080
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,960
the more fat that your liver has to you

1081
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,599
know break down the more bile it has to

1082
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,200
produce and break down more fat in your

1083
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,760
your diet the the less it's going to

1084
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,040
have the ability to rejuvenate the less

1085
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,119
it's going to have the the ability to

1086
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,240
get rid of the poison that's actually

1087
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,920
causing the conversion problems that's

1088
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,800
actually causing the folate and the

1089
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,839
folic you know the the folic acid

1090
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,119
conversion problems and the amino acid

1091
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,760
conversion problems you know with MTHFR

1092
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,599
gene mutation issues so the whole point

1093
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,119
here is if you're doing Foods whe so say

1094
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,040
you're on a plant-based diet don't

1095
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,520
overdo the nuts don't overdo the avocado

1096
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,280
you know so if you're on a plant-based

1097
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,520
diet you know more fresh fruits and

1098
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,960
vegetables more obviously um and you

1099
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,760
know more sweet potatoes but if you're

1100
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,200
on say a Palo diet or a meat eating diet

1101
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,880
you know whatever that might be like you

1102
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,720
do chicken twice a day or something or

1103
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,359
you do turkey for lunch chicken for you

1104
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,880
got to break it down to once a day

1105
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:18,520
because if you don't you're going to

1106
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,880
have a little too much fat going on so

1107
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,359
that means you know for lunch maybe do

1108
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,000
avocado Which is less fat than chicken

1109
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,720
for lunch so that you just knock down a

1110
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,720
level of fat intake greatly and then at

1111
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,559
dinner do something that you like that's

1112
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,200
in the animal protein realm if you're if

1113
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,760
you're big in animal protein the point

1114
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:43,480
is is lowering the fat in the diet in

1115
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:46,280
any way helps stop the the the liver

1116
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,200
from declining so it can pick speed up

1117
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,760
again so it can start to heal clean up

1118
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,359
and so you can start using the different

1119
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,800
things to knock out the viral load that

1120
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,880
could be in the liver that's producing

1121
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,880
the gene mutation test triggering it off

1122
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,920
by producing all of that byproduct

1123
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,960
floating around in the bloodstream so

1124
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,280
for instance let's go over Foods the

1125
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,800
wild blueberries really heal and cleanse

1126
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,800
the liver celery juice cleanses the

1127
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,000
liver so you could do the 16 ounces look

1128
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,240
go to my blog go to my blog and check

1129
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,119
out different things you check out the

1130
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,319
celery juice and it's for you and I want

1131
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,160
you to go into my blog because you're

1132
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:23,400
going to see a big snap snazzy picture

1133
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,839
of me holding up celery juice that's not

1134
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,000
it I want you doing the celery juice you

1135
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,240
to do it okay I'm doing it at home

1136
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,119
that's already happening so you don't

1137
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,520
need to see that on the blog get there

1138
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,720
and know what the recipe is understand

1139
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,359
do the celery juice and then you know

1140
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,680
bring in the sweet potatoes they help

1141
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,400
cleanse the liver because there's no fat

1142
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,599
in the sweet potato virtually virtually

1143
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,599
none in there and so that helps with the

1144
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,720
liver winter squash helps with the

1145
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,240
healing of the liver so these are some

1146
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,520
of the foods you can do and you know hey

1147
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,599
look if it's winter it's it's cold you

1148
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,920
do more sweet potato do sweet potatoes

1149
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,280
for lunch if you if you love animal

1150
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,960
products you know Skip skip the you know

1151
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,640
whatever it is for lunch turkey or the

1152
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,720
chicken or the the the meat for lunch

1153
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,040
and do the sweet potatoes for lunch

1154
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,640
you're going to be getting your gene

1155
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:18,040
mutation you know reversed you're going

1156
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:20,000
to be getting things reversed and then

1157
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,319
for dinner time you can then do whatever

1158
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,040
it is that you do you know and if you're

1159
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,079
and once again if you're vegetarian or

1160
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,119
you're you know vegan or PL base or

1161
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,799
whatever you you want to be that you

1162
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:33,280
feel is good you know it's incredible

1163
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:35,839
for liver problems that create the gene

1164
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,680
mutation okay or create the false gene

1165
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:41,280
mutation test that we talked about all

1166
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,240
through here and so but the best thing

1167
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:49,200
to do ever is to at least take a moment

1168
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:51,720
in your life and have it really lowfat

1169
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,280
that means you're doing lots of salads

1170
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,119
with fruit in them or you're doing

1171
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,520
smoothies green smoothies and we talk

1172
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,480
about that all the time the different

1173
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,319
smoothies and everything I mean you'll

1174
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,000
see them on Facebook and Instagram and

1175
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,640
all that so you'll get you get an idea

1176
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,079
better smoothies and you'll find recipes

1177
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,160
in the life-changing Foods book any of

1178
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,240
the

1179
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,000
recipes you know are helpful for the

1180
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,280
gene mutation issue that we have that's

1181
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,920
that's rampant out there that we're

1182
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,960
talking about see lowering the fats gets

1183
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,200
the liver to produce less bile and it

1184
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,760
gets it to rejuvenate fast so when

1185
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,880
you're doing that celery juice and then

1186
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,240
eating some oranges in the morning

1187
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,079
having a mango then lunchtime having a

1188
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:35,359
spinach tomato you know um spinach

1189
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,440
tomato soup and then in the afternoon

1190
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,160
you're having um you're having celery

1191
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,200
sticks and apples and other things like

1192
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,200
that and then you know for dinner time

1193
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,240
you do the sweet potatoes for dinner

1194
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,920
it's something like that in that realm

1195
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,880
that lowers your fats enough in one day

1196
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,359
to purge the liver so that you're not

1197
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,720
told you can't detox so that your liver

1198
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:02,920
can recover and cleanse and when it

1199
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,480
recovers and cleanses you're home free

1200
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,480
with the methylation issue and you can

1201
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,680
be freed from the test that tells you

1202
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,040
you have a gene mutation you can

1203
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,000
actually be freed from that over time

1204
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,200
part of that like I said is getting the

1205
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,920
viral load down because it's

1206
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,280
viruses and some heavy metals that lie

1207
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,440
in the liver that they lay in the liver

1208
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,760
there they hide in there and they're

1209
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,359
working on creating junk and byproduct

1210
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,400
and garbage and this could be

1211
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,040
responsible for your symptoms too the

1212
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,079
whole thing the viruses that create

1213
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,200
chronic fatigue fibromyalgia the Epstein

1214
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,319
bar that's a big one all of these

1215
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,000
different viruses that sit in the liver

1216
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:45,000
they create whatever your symptoms are

1217
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,640
and your additional mtfr gene mutation

1218
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,720
you see what I mean it even creates that

1219
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,640
so in short the viral issue is creating

1220
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,599
your gene mutation that's that's what

1221
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,200
I'm talking about being inside the liver

1222
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,079
getting it clogged up getting it

1223
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,400
sluggish getting it problematic and then

1224
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,760
your blood gets dirty your methylation

1225
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,799
ability drops greatly because the liver

1226
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,160
has so much to do with methylation along

1227
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:13,359
with that part in the colon I was

1228
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,440
talking to you about you guys about and

1229
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,240
so what do you do you get the antivirals

1230
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,280
going on like we talked about the zinc

1231
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,520
and you bring in some ibrite try some

1232
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,720
ibrite too talk to your practitioner say

1233
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,799
you want to go antiviral bring in some

1234
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,760
ibrite bringing lemon bomb red clover

1235
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:32,920
tea cleans out the blood real nice by

1236
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,119
the way could really reverse that

1237
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,480
inflamation that's triggering off that

1238
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,880
gene mutation test you know and lemon

1239
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,760
bomb the nettle Leaf the olive leaf I

1240
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,400
talked about earlier you bring a little

1241
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,680
bit of that in the cat's Claw is amazing

1242
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,200
the reason why cats claw works so good

1243
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,040
with lime patients now and you know and

1244
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,920
cats claw has been you know that's been

1245
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,240
something that Spirits always promoted

1246
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,040
back since I was a child and that cat's

1247
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,760
claw works because it's killing off

1248
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,720
viruses and it eventually can lead you

1249
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,720
to not having a methylation problem now

1250
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,240
you may have already a diagnosis of

1251
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,319
something and you don't trigger off as a

1252
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,680
methylation problem it doesn't mean you

1253
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,599
don't have one the test itself is not

1254
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,720
concrete it's not Ironclad so it's

1255
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,280
picking up inflammation sometimes and

1256
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,200
sometimes it doesn't it's not perfect

1257
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,960
there's no test in medical research and

1258
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,880
IAL science that is absolutely perfect

1259
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,520
and even blood typing is not perfect in

1260
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,079
science and research testing sometimes

1261
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,280
someone can have one blood type and two

1262
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:41,000
months later get it tested again and it

1263
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,520
