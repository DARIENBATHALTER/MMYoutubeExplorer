[193.74 - 197.70] troubleshooting stuff out there what's
[195.78 - 201.08] the best supplementation what's the best
[197.70 - 204.00] things to use right and so I it matters
[201.08 - 207.48] the quality it's not even just quality
[204.00 - 209.28] it's like Supreme quality that's what
[207.48 - 211.26] counts because everybody can just say
[209.28 - 213.78] quality now you can put out the
[211.26 - 216.12] shittiest crappiest piece of crap
[213.78 - 218.52] supplement out there and call it quality
[216.12 - 220.80] now that's how the world works right you
[218.52 - 222.78] can put out the worst stuff the worst
[220.80 - 225.00] quality crap and you can use the term
[222.78 - 227.04] quality that's what supplement companies
[225.00 - 231.00] do now they'll use oh quality our
[227.04 - 233.46] quality is there oh sure sure there's a
[231.00 - 236.28] lot of things that determine real true
[233.46 - 238.44] quality one of the one of the things
[236.28 - 241.14] that determines it is not putting in
[238.44 - 241.86] hidden ingredients hidden ingredients in
[241.14 - 244.74] there
[241.86 - 246.90] like ingredients that are not disclosed
[244.74 - 250.26] on the bottle and supplement companies
[246.90 - 252.30] put up to 10 percent of crap inside
[250.26 - 253.62] their supplements and they don't tell
[252.30 - 255.90] anybody they don't disclose it or
[253.62 - 257.58] anything that's one of the most
[255.90 - 259.92] important things to know right there
[257.58 - 262.56] that takes you into like what's called
[259.92 - 264.06] real quality anyway before I start
[262.56 - 265.86] reading about the quickening I want to
[264.06 - 267.36] talk about that I just want it to go
[265.86 - 270.36] over
[267.36 - 271.98] this incredible what I call a gift
[270.36 - 273.84] that's happening
[271.98 - 276.96] which is amazing that beverage is doing
[273.84 - 279.84] so if you just got on here if you get a
[276.96 - 281.04] hundred dollars worth of products from
[279.84 - 285.06] Bemidji
[281.04 - 287.34] and then you can tack on an extra
[285.06 - 289.62] product like it's a lemon balm that's
[287.34 - 293.04] the product right vimorgy.com V is in
[289.62 - 295.86] Victor i m ismary ergy.com
[293.04 - 298.98] and it's at vimergy.com not on Amazon so
[295.86 - 301.32] vimergy.com not on Amazon you can tack
[298.98 - 306.66] on after that hundred dollars
[301.32 - 309.36] a free 30 bottle of lemon balm right
[306.66 - 312.50] there the nervine that's what I call it
[309.36 - 314.42] the nerve Vine what does that mean
[312.50 - 317.28] nervous system
[314.42 - 319.08] nervous system calming the nervous
[317.28 - 320.94] system and so many people are so jacked
[319.08 - 322.62] up right now they're so stressed out
[320.94 - 325.62] they're going through so much they're
[322.62 - 329.48] dealing with so much crap out there and
[325.62 - 331.92] it's critical to have that nerve Vine
[329.48 - 334.62] for those things that people are up
[331.92 - 336.84] against so many things that people are
[334.62 - 338.46] up against so I wanted everybody's under
[336.84 - 341.48] stress right now hardships losses
[338.46 - 344.70] emotional hurt they are dealing with it
[341.48 - 346.86] life's BS that they're handed all these
[344.70 - 350.22] different things so it's important to
[346.86 - 352.56] have that nerve-ind calm things down
[350.22 - 353.58] and that's a big deal right there so I
[352.56 - 355.86] just want to tell you about the lemon
[353.58 - 358.32] balm the deal of imagery.com about that
[355.86 - 360.54] like that blows my mind it just blows my
[358.32 - 363.36] mind okay letting you know
[360.54 - 365.46] and so it's a propolis I don't go
[363.36 - 368.64] anywhere without these two
[365.46 - 370.62] propolis right there now I can't say it
[368.64 - 374.30] enough right
[370.62 - 378.48] so the propolis pure contains over
[374.30 - 381.74] consistently contains over well over 50
[378.48 - 385.26] percent of active bioavailable
[381.74 - 386.64] polyphenols like quercetin and there's
[385.26 - 389.82] just one of them and one of the
[386.64 - 392.70] polyphenols right it contains that
[389.82 - 396.26] and that's incredible all on its own so
[392.70 - 400.32] this is one incredible reason but I know
[396.26 - 402.36] when I tell doctor friends practitioner
[400.32 - 404.16] friends out there and they're like you
[402.36 - 407.04] know I got patience that have this going
[404.16 - 409.32] on that going on and and I'm like well
[407.04 - 410.82] are you doing the propolis have you told
[409.32 - 412.38] your patients about the propolis and
[410.82 - 414.18] then they get the patients on the
[412.38 - 417.48] propolis and then
[414.18 - 420.54] just crazy stuff happens where things
[417.48 - 423.78] are being reversed and that is critical
[420.54 - 426.78] so immune system is I don't even call a
[423.78 - 429.06] propolis I call it immune system uh do
[426.78 - 430.38] you have my bottle of immune system do I
[429.06 - 432.00] have my bottle of immune system over
[430.38 - 433.92] there where is it where's my immune
[432.00 - 437.58] system that's what I actually call
[433.92 - 438.84] propolis pure because literally it's
[437.58 - 440.22] that powerful thank you for the light
[438.84 - 441.96] blasting I think you're welcome can't
[440.22 - 445.80] wait to do another one soon
[441.96 - 448.80] so I don't go anywhere without these two
[445.80 - 451.26] lemon balm and the propolis right there
[448.80 - 453.96] and the quality of this propolis so
[451.26 - 456.60] let's hit that for a little bit
[453.96 - 460.04] okay
[456.60 - 460.04] there's no alcohol in here
[460.14 - 466.14] but not just no alcohol
[463.92 - 467.52] there's no alcohol now there's a reason
[466.14 - 469.62] why I'm saying that just think about
[467.52 - 471.06] that for a second he said no alcohol he
[469.62 - 472.02] said no alcohol why is he saying it
[471.06 - 473.70] twice
[472.02 - 475.32] why is he doing that is he repeating
[473.70 - 477.24] himself no
[475.32 - 479.82] there's not just no alcohol in this
[477.24 - 482.04] propolis there's no alcohol what does
[479.82 - 483.60] that mean is it a trick question it
[482.04 - 485.04] means there's propolises out there that
[483.60 - 487.26] say non-alcohol
[485.04 - 489.66] that have alcohol
[487.26 - 491.28] because of the extraction process the
[489.66 - 495.00] extraction process
[491.28 - 497.10] propolis pure does not have alcohol but
[495.00 - 500.76] for real
[497.10 - 503.64] does not have alcohol in there
[500.76 - 505.86] critical to know oh yeah no I found a
[503.64 - 508.14] propolis out there they do have you it's
[505.86 - 509.82] got no alcohol in it uh
[508.14 - 513.54] sure
[509.82 - 516.12] sure it doesn't have no alcohol in it
[513.54 - 518.34] sure I believe that I don't believe that
[516.12 - 519.54] that's the whole point that's the
[518.34 - 521.94] difference
[519.54 - 523.32] and that guarantee for me knowing
[521.94 - 526.46] there's no alcohol in the process
[523.32 - 529.44] there's no alcohol in this bottle
[526.46 - 531.84] critical because there's alcohol in
[529.44 - 534.20] propolises even when they say no alcohol
[531.84 - 537.00] or no alcohol added or no alcohol
[534.20 - 538.14] there's alcohol in there I could say it
[537.00 - 541.32] a thousand times I'll tell you why
[538.14 - 544.80] because it's a big deal huge huge deal
[541.32 - 547.02] because we need a propolis without that
[544.80 - 549.78] it makes a big difference because
[547.02 - 552.18] without it your propolis is really
[549.78 - 553.32] stronger that's just one aspect all in
[552.18 - 555.24] its own and then you talk about
[553.32 - 557.76] beverages propolis like
[555.24 - 560.10] that's another level of quality all on
[557.76 - 562.02] its own when you taste this it's unlike
[560.10 - 564.24] any propolis out there I actually dare
[562.02 - 565.80] you to get propolises but I don't want
[564.24 - 568.68] to want you to waste money
[565.80 - 571.38] but dare you to get propolises and then
[568.68 - 573.30] do do the taste test you take this one
[571.38 - 574.62] right here the propolis pure and you do
[573.30 - 577.02] that and then you do the others and
[574.62 - 578.34] you'll just be like what the heck is
[577.02 - 580.20] going on
[578.34 - 582.00] and this is my favorite supplement of
[580.20 - 584.28] all time people ask me what is your
[582.00 - 586.50] favorite supplement aw I get asked that
[584.28 - 587.82] so many times just like what's your
[586.50 - 589.68] favorite this what's your favorite that
[587.82 - 593.04] right what's your favorite my favorite
[589.68 - 595.92] supplement of all time hands down is
[593.04 - 598.74] this propolis pure right here to know
[595.92 - 600.84] that there's one made us in a specific
[598.74 - 602.70] way it's a precious and complex
[600.84 - 605.40] substance from nature
[602.70 - 607.74] that offers many benefits for health
[605.40 - 610.92] right including the immune system which
[607.74 - 612.36] is one of the big reasons all on its own
[610.92 - 614.64] and oral health I mean you know people
[612.36 - 616.44] with oral health issues
[614.64 - 618.60] so many people walk around with oral
[616.44 - 621.96] health problems
[618.60 - 624.06] yeah propolis is critical especially
[621.96 - 625.44] with oral health stuff very important
[624.06 - 628.56] all on its own
[625.44 - 631.02] so what happens with vimergy's propolis
[628.56 - 633.12] it's sourced from a limited number of
[631.02 - 635.52] carefully screened beekeeping operations
[633.12 - 637.08] that's the big difference I'm I'm just
[635.52 - 640.80] excited today because when I found out
[637.08 - 642.84] about the Free bottle of lemon balm with
[640.80 - 644.94] an order of a hundred dollars and then
[642.84 - 647.22] you tack on your lemon balm for free
[644.94 - 648.84] when I found that out I'm like I'm gonna
[647.22 - 650.46] talk about I can't help it that's
[648.84 - 653.70] amazing I'm going to talk about my
[650.46 - 656.40] favorite supplement of all time
[653.70 - 658.80] which is the propolis
[656.40 - 660.72] so it's from a limited number of
[658.80 - 662.64] carefully screened beekeeping operations
[660.72 - 664.74] and that right there changes the game
[662.64 - 667.14] all on its own
[664.74 - 669.60] and in and the other thing it involves a
[667.14 - 672.48] unique purification process
[669.60 - 674.40] that results in containing well over 50
[672.48 - 676.80] percent of its polyphenols you gotta
[674.40 - 678.24] understand what that is like what that
[676.80 - 680.34] means if you're somebody that's
[678.24 - 684.00] interested in just knowledge about
[680.34 - 687.06] supplementation knowledge about it
[684.00 - 689.58] this is an incredible situation right
[687.06 - 691.62] here with the Vemma G propolis pure
[689.58 - 693.60] if you're somebody that see you're a
[691.62 - 694.80] knowledge Seeker like I'm seeking
[693.60 - 697.44] knowledge
[694.80 - 698.82] I'm telling you some really unbelievable
[697.44 - 701.04] things right here
[698.82 - 703.22] Source from a limited number of
[701.04 - 707.82] carefully screened beekeeping operations
[703.22 - 709.92] that means it's not just a [ __ ]
[707.82 - 712.14] situation
[709.92 - 714.54] that's out there when people slap stuff
[712.14 - 717.72] together and stick it in bottles
[714.54 - 719.04] that means it's far from that
[717.72 - 720.78] and that's really important to
[719.04 - 724.02] understand and then their purification
[720.78 - 726.00] process allows doesn't kill the stuff
[724.02 - 727.68] and that's another thing too propolis is
[726.00 - 730.14] out there when they do the purification
[727.68 - 734.64] process they kill the active ingredients
[730.14 - 736.68] think about that right now just you guys
[734.64 - 739.08] I'm excited because basically remember
[736.68 - 742.08] she's giving a gift out
[739.08 - 746.16] they're giving a thirty dollar bottle a
[742.08 - 747.90] four ounce bottle of lemon balm for free
[746.16 - 750.66] with a hundred dollar order at
[747.90 - 751.98] vimorgy.com but it's fmergy.com not on
[750.66 - 754.32] Amazon
[751.98 - 757.50] so I want to talk about this the process
[754.32 - 760.02] of propolis
[757.50 - 762.66] when you when you process propolis you
[760.02 - 764.94] kill you kill all its active ingredients
[762.66 - 766.68] that's what happens out there
[764.94 - 768.84] but they have a unique purification
[766.68 - 771.60] process that results in keeping the
[768.84 - 774.24] bioactive ingredients polyphenols well
[771.60 - 776.70] over 50 percent strong and bioactive
[774.24 - 781.22] critical right there stay calm says
[776.70 - 781.22] propolis has helped my gum pain a lot
[781.56 - 787.20] anybody with oral issues whatsoever this
[785.04 - 788.64] is what I point to
[787.20 - 791.40] people are worried about oral health
[788.64 - 792.84] this is what I point to right here
[791.40 - 795.12] this is it
[792.84 - 797.16] Health with Haley says should you swish
[795.12 - 799.92] the propolis in your mouth to help with
[797.16 - 801.90] oral care or just swallow what I do is I
[799.92 - 803.76] put it straight in my mouth and I just
[801.90 - 806.40] let it sit there I let it move around
[803.76 - 808.38] and sit in my mouth
[806.40 - 810.48] a lot of people are like a lot of people
[808.38 - 812.88] talk about things they do orally like I
[810.48 - 814.08] do oil pulling or I do this well let me
[812.88 - 816.72] tell you
[814.08 - 817.68] this is a lot more beneficial than any
[816.72 - 819.66] of that
[817.68 - 820.74] you put propolis in your mouth before
[819.66 - 822.66] bed
[820.74 - 824.88] because that's what I do I put propolis
[822.66 - 828.06] in my mouth before bed
[824.88 - 829.92] just so you know I'm an older guy I got
[828.06 - 833.04] all my teeth
[829.92 - 835.50] I don't have implants in my mouth there
[833.04 - 837.42] are no implants in my mouth
[835.50 - 839.82] and you know I have the purple shock
[837.42 - 841.02] therapy in the brain saver book just
[839.82 - 843.54] letting you know the propolis shock
[841.02 - 846.54] therapy instructions on putting it on
[843.54 - 847.98] canker sores mouth sores this is a big
[846.54 - 849.72] deal
[847.98 - 851.58] and some people
[849.72 - 854.04] you know they might have good oral
[851.58 - 856.02] health going on where you want to keep
[854.04 - 859.14] good oral health too
[856.02 - 862.20] and that's a whole other level
[859.14 - 864.18] so I'm not 20 years old I'm not 30 years
[862.20 - 866.70] old
[864.18 - 870.00] you know even though even though the
[866.70 - 873.24] internet says I'm what 29 now
[870.00 - 875.28] so Ali stare says I thought we could
[873.24 - 877.86] just heal with food
[875.28 - 881.22] so the question is I thought we can just
[877.86 - 883.26] heal with food right what people are up
[881.22 - 885.36] against and everybody's situation is
[883.26 - 886.98] different I've seen a person just heal
[885.36 - 890.04] with celery juice
[886.98 - 893.40] I'm sorry but I have I have seen that
[890.04 - 895.44] just acid reflux gone that's it I've
[893.40 - 897.24] seen that somebody's blood pressure down
[895.44 - 898.92] boom gone their blood pressure's down
[897.24 - 901.38] high blood pressure's down because
[898.92 - 903.00] celery juice right and they just did
[901.38 - 904.56] celery juice I've seen that over and
[903.00 - 906.48] over again out there there's a lot of
[904.56 - 908.40] people with chronic sickness So when you
[906.48 - 910.10] say I thought we can just heal with just
[908.40 - 913.20] food
[910.10 - 915.50] that is not encompassing everybody
[913.20 - 918.30] everybody's different
[915.50 - 920.70] everybody is different
[918.30 - 922.86] there are people out there with a lot of
[920.70 - 925.92] viral inflammation a lot of pathogenic
[922.86 - 927.72] problems a lot of toxic stuff inside of
[925.92 - 930.00] them a lot of toxic junk inside of them
[927.72 - 931.26] a lot of different contaminations and
[930.00 - 934.38] exposures
[931.26 - 936.66] and a lot of different support system
[934.38 - 939.06] issues they're struggling they don't
[936.66 - 941.58] have a great great resources they don't
[939.06 - 945.06] have a great support system and so when
[941.58 - 946.62] you say I thought we only need food for
[945.06 - 948.42] healing well who are we talking about
[946.62 - 950.46] talking about somebody with less stress
[948.42 - 953.64] somebody with less contamination of
[950.46 - 956.46] toxins and exposure somebody with less
[953.64 - 959.04] less pathogenic contamination because if
[956.46 - 960.96] we're talking about that then maybe yeah
[959.04 - 962.40] you can totally heal things up with just
[960.96 - 963.72] food but then you get a whole bunch of
[962.40 - 965.70] people they've been sick for 10 years
[963.72 - 967.38] they've been sick for five years they're
[965.70 - 969.36] struggling they got a lot of issues
[967.38 - 971.22] going on they got a lot of exposure they
[969.36 - 973.68] got a lot of situations a lot of stress
[971.22 - 975.54] their adrenals are totally beaten down
[973.68 - 977.88] and maxed out and they need
[975.54 - 980.64] supplementation
[977.88 - 983.30] you get somebody with with a real
[980.64 - 986.10] challenging condition they need
[983.30 - 988.38] supplementation so that's important to
[986.10 - 990.54] know and then supplementation is a
[988.38 - 991.92] blanket big one term what's
[990.54 - 994.02] supplementation what are you even
[991.92 - 995.64] talking about because there's a lot of
[994.02 - 998.76] crap out there if you're talking about
[995.64 - 1001.22] liver you know packed in some kind of
[998.76 - 1003.02] chewable or you're talking about some
[1001.22 - 1005.54] gummy are you talking you're talking
[1003.02 - 1008.06] about some you know you know ABC Gummy
[1005.54 - 1011.42] or whatever it is ACV gummy whatever it
[1008.06 - 1015.32] is that's doesn't mean that's going to
[1011.42 - 1019.06] help it's specific supplementation for
[1015.32 - 1022.70] specific reasons and specific quality
[1019.06 - 1024.74] all that matters it's somebody's healing
[1022.70 - 1026.60] could be make or break
[1024.74 - 1028.16] make or break with just a few different
[1026.60 - 1029.30] things because it's Death By A Thousand
[1028.16 - 1031.04] Cuts
[1029.30 - 1032.54] and notice I put that term out there
[1031.04 - 1034.04] Death By A Thousand Cuts when it comes
[1032.54 - 1036.02] down to health issues and what happens
[1034.04 - 1037.58] when we're struggling with health issues
[1036.02 - 1039.20] and it's Death By A Thousand Cuts and
[1037.58 - 1040.94] now I see influencers out there saying
[1039.20 - 1042.92] Death By A Thousand Cuts
[1040.94 - 1044.36] Death By A Thousand Cuts no mention of
[1042.92 - 1046.04] medical medium death by a thousand
[1044.36 - 1047.66] because of course I got to throw that in
[1046.04 - 1048.86] I can't help it
[1047.66 - 1050.90] but
[1048.86 - 1052.88] propolis is key for the immune system
[1050.90 - 1055.04] strengths if you're somebody and you're
[1052.88 - 1057.32] relying on just food
[1055.04 - 1060.44] well your immune system might need a lot
[1057.32 - 1062.12] more than that for whatever's going on
[1060.44 - 1063.80] critical to know somebody's dealing with
[1062.12 - 1065.90] mouth ulcers and all kinds of issues and
[1063.80 - 1067.46] Immunity problems immune system issues
[1065.90 - 1069.86] that's
[1067.46 - 1071.60] a whole nother thing so that's why it's
[1069.86 - 1074.60] critical to know
[1071.60 - 1076.52] there are tools out there so two two of
[1074.60 - 1078.98] my favorite supplements I don't budge I
[1076.52 - 1081.44] don't go anywhere without two of them
[1078.98 - 1082.58] right here the propolis and the lemon
[1081.44 - 1084.98] balm
[1082.58 - 1087.02] why should I take lemon balm because I'm
[1084.98 - 1088.64] under enormous stress all the time I
[1087.02 - 1089.60] mean I don't know if you guys know but I
[1088.64 - 1091.64] am right
[1089.60 - 1093.86] people are up against hardships they're
[1091.64 - 1095.24] up against stress adrenaline lowers
[1093.86 - 1096.86] their immune system because they're
[1095.24 - 1098.18] always getting jacked up with adrenaline
[1096.86 - 1101.06] from stress
[1098.18 - 1104.60] and they need immune system support and
[1101.06 - 1106.70] antioxidants the polyphenols very
[1104.60 - 1108.56] important all on its own
[1106.70 - 1111.50] I know that there are people out there
[1108.56 - 1113.60] and Chip propolis is critical critical
[1111.50 - 1116.00] for the immune system and then you throw
[1113.60 - 1118.82] in toxic chemicals metals that people
[1116.00 - 1120.98] have bugs and flu bugs and pathogens
[1118.82 - 1122.42] that are going on more things that break
[1120.98 - 1123.62] down their immune system and breaks down
[1122.42 - 1125.78] their immune system and breaks down
[1123.62 - 1127.22] their immune system more of that and
[1125.78 - 1129.08] then we're in a whole nother game
[1127.22 - 1130.10] something very important to know and I
[1129.08 - 1132.80] do know
[1130.10 - 1135.56] but there is um there are some people
[1132.80 - 1138.44] that are total you know they the total
[1135.56 - 1139.76] downers about supplementation
[1138.44 - 1141.38] because they don't know the difference
[1139.76 - 1145.16] they don't know the difference from
[1141.38 - 1148.64] garbage junk supplementation like whey
[1145.16 - 1151.40] protein powder and garbage like that and
[1148.64 - 1153.38] all kinds of big tablets with you know
[1151.40 - 1155.24] all kinds of junk in it with a hundred
[1153.38 - 1158.66] products in it they don't know the
[1155.24 - 1160.58] difference from the gelatin tablets all
[1158.66 - 1162.26] the junk all the whey protein powder all
[1160.58 - 1164.54] the natural flavors and everything they
[1162.26 - 1167.30] don't know that difference
[1164.54 - 1168.92] from there to something this pure and
[1167.30 - 1170.60] this unbelievable for the immune system
[1168.92 - 1172.88] so what they do is because they're
[1170.60 - 1175.22] ignorant of that understanding out there
[1172.88 - 1176.96] not the person who has the question that
[1175.22 - 1178.40] said doesn't can't we just do it with
[1176.96 - 1179.36] food no not you I'm talking about the
[1178.40 - 1181.94] people out there there's some
[1179.36 - 1184.52] influencers out there that will say you
[1181.94 - 1187.52] know you don't need supplements ever you
[1184.52 - 1189.14] don't need any of that right it's sad
[1187.52 - 1190.76] when they say that because what are they
[1189.14 - 1192.62] talking about if somebody would have
[1190.76 - 1195.08] busted up immune system someone who's
[1192.62 - 1197.24] struggling and suffering somebody who
[1195.08 - 1198.62] has a lot of challenges with their
[1197.24 - 1200.54] immune cells
[1198.62 - 1201.80] and you're like and they hear that and
[1200.54 - 1203.36] they're just confused and they're like
[1201.80 - 1205.94] oh okay
[1203.36 - 1207.14] and then they're also not being told the
[1205.94 - 1210.08] difference they're not being told the
[1207.14 - 1212.42] difference from just gelatin based
[1210.08 - 1215.06] garbage filled with all kinds of crap
[1212.42 - 1217.22] and whey protein powder and then trendy
[1215.06 - 1220.28] stuff that isn't good like charcoal
[1217.22 - 1223.46] which is terrible for the for the the
[1220.28 - 1225.20] intestinal tract terrible for their body
[1223.46 - 1227.72] and they don't know the difference of
[1225.20 - 1230.00] all the bad stuff out there the Clays
[1227.72 - 1232.22] the bentonite clay the charcoal the
[1230.00 - 1234.92] Pearl powder all the junk and garbage
[1232.22 - 1236.96] and the trend stuff they don't know that
[1234.92 - 1239.30] difference right there compared to
[1236.96 - 1243.26] something that has over 50 percent of
[1239.30 - 1246.50] its polyphenols bioactive quercetin
[1243.26 - 1248.60] that's not dead it's alive in the
[1246.50 - 1250.16] propolis pure and what that means I'm
[1248.60 - 1253.10] talking about this
[1250.16 - 1256.28] because these things need to be talked
[1253.10 - 1257.66] about once in a while they just do they
[1256.28 - 1260.30] need to be talked about once in a while
[1257.66 - 1261.92] what comes down to moving the needle you
[1260.30 - 1263.78] want something that helps to move the
[1261.92 - 1267.14] needle you don't want to be dogging it
[1263.78 - 1270.92] you don't want your health dogging it
[1267.14 - 1275.12] and a lot of people they can't stay on a
[1270.92 - 1277.28] good path they get thrown off all the
[1275.12 - 1281.12] time thrown off the wagon all the time
[1277.28 - 1283.10] by being influenced by so much crap out
[1281.12 - 1285.50] there that they're being pushed off the
[1283.10 - 1287.12] wagon and they don't know which way the
[1285.50 - 1289.10] wind blows with their health they have
[1287.12 - 1291.56] no idea what they should do they're
[1289.10 - 1293.66] eating all kinds of crazy stuff they're
[1291.56 - 1295.04] doing their cheat days and if that's the
[1293.66 - 1297.38] case then it's critical to keep your
[1295.04 - 1299.36] immune system strong if you don't know
[1297.38 - 1300.86] what is going on with your health if you
[1299.36 - 1302.18] don't know what's happening it's
[1300.86 - 1305.06] critical to have your immune system
[1302.18 - 1307.10] supported and that's a big deal anyway
[1305.06 - 1309.20] two supplements before I read a little
[1307.10 - 1312.62] bit about the quickening right here two
[1309.20 - 1313.82] supplements that are critical and lemon
[1312.62 - 1315.62] balm

[1425.72 - 1430.28] got off my medical medium supplements
[1427.58 - 1432.20] and the effects were catastrophic
[1430.28 - 1434.36] such a lie that people don't need
[1432.20 - 1436.10] supplements it makes or breaks for me
[1434.36 - 1438.02] there's it's make or break I've talked

[1447.38 - 1452.62] for years and years
[1449.90 - 1455.30] from the very first book and way before
[1452.62 - 1458.30] I've been talking about it's critical
[1455.30 - 1460.52] that the chronically ill they don't get
[1458.30 - 1463.28] swayed off their game
[1460.52 - 1465.86] because it's make or break crap that
[1463.28 - 1467.96] happens but it's easy to get lost
[1465.86 - 1470.66] because you get okay first of all let's
[1467.96 - 1472.94] go into this if there's it's no
[1470.66 - 1474.50] Secret
[1472.94 - 1476.24] that there's people that don't like me
[1474.50 - 1477.98] out there in health the health World
[1476.24 - 1479.90] they don't think I should have a space
[1477.98 - 1481.40] in the health world even though they're
[1479.90 - 1485.42] they're ripping off the medical medium
[1481.40 - 1487.34] information daily and not citing it back
[1485.42 - 1489.26] there's people out there health
[1487.34 - 1491.78] influencers and so forth that don't
[1489.26 - 1495.44] believe I deserve a space in the health
[1491.78 - 1497.24] realm even though nobody even had an
[1495.44 - 1500.06] inkling to what was wrong with anybody
[1497.24 - 1502.16] just eight nine years ago when the first
[1500.06 - 1505.04] book came out
[1502.16 - 1507.02] even though I have 35 plus years of
[1505.04 - 1508.52] experience of bringing people's lives
[1507.02 - 1511.64] back and so there's people out there
[1508.52 - 1513.74] that don't think I deserve any space at
[1511.64 - 1516.32] all in the health scene
[1513.74 - 1518.06] right they just don't like me so what
[1516.32 - 1519.32] they do is they conjure up things to
[1518.06 - 1522.68] break down the medical medium Community
[1519.32 - 1524.90] they conjure up stuff they throw stuff
[1522.68 - 1526.70] at the mm Community all the time you
[1524.90 - 1528.20] don't need a supplement
[1526.70 - 1530.30] you don't need to take any meanwhile
[1528.20 - 1531.32] they take it behind the scenes meanwhile
[1530.30 - 1532.70] the ones that are saying it the
[1531.32 - 1535.22] influencers that are saying it to people
[1532.70 - 1536.72] you don't need to take your your memory
[1535.22 - 1538.82] you don't need to take your supplements
[1536.72 - 1542.54] meanwhile they're they're taking
[1538.82 - 1544.94] the Bemidji supplements behind the scene
[1542.54 - 1548.00] because the intentions there are because
[1544.94 - 1550.88] it's towards me right it's towards the
[1548.00 - 1552.62] medical medium so you try to break down
[1550.88 - 1554.42] the community this happens all the time
[1552.62 - 1557.90] I see it all the time
[1554.42 - 1561.26] Steph Ever After says Bemidji sups have
[1557.90 - 1563.90] given me my life back B12 lemon balm
[1561.26 - 1565.76] ashwagandha zinc micro C
[1563.90 - 1567.20] if you get a hundred dollar order at
[1565.76 - 1570.38] vimergy.com
[1567.20 - 1574.10] you go to venergy.com 100 order
[1570.38 - 1576.38] you get a free four ounce bottle almost
[1574.10 - 1579.08] four ounce bottle of the lemon balm
[1576.38 - 1581.60] right here you just have to go to
[1579.08 - 1584.60] vimergy.com
[1581.60 - 1587.48] get your do your 100 order or more and
[1584.60 - 1589.04] then tack on an additional lemon bomb
[1587.48 - 1590.92] and then hit the code that they have
[1589.04 - 1593.78] there I think it's like
[1590.92 - 1596.26] f-r-e-e-l-e-m I mean that you'll see the
[1593.78 - 1596.26] code there
[1596.42 - 1599.78] so
[1597.86 - 1601.52] I want to go back to make or break I've
[1599.78 - 1603.56] been talking about that for years I
[1601.52 - 1605.90] remember doing a lecture
[1603.56 - 1607.76] like seven eight years ago
[1605.90 - 1609.62] one of my lectures I was doing is a
[1607.76 - 1612.08] crowd of people and I was talking about
[1609.62 - 1614.12] make or break on how every little thing
[1612.08 - 1616.88] matters because it's Death By A Thousand
[1614.12 - 1619.64] Cuts and every little thing matters with
[1616.88 - 1621.62] your healing process this is critical I
[1619.64 - 1624.86] noticed if I don't talk about this for a
[1621.62 - 1627.44] while the snakes come in
[1624.86 - 1630.74] and the Sharks come in
[1627.44 - 1632.06] and the opportunists come in and they
[1630.74 - 1634.16] come into the medical medium community
[1632.06 - 1636.98] and they advertise to the medical medium
[1634.16 - 1639.92] Community to death or they sit there and
[1636.98 - 1642.74] they just literally talk down medical
[1639.92 - 1646.10] medium and try to get them parading on
[1642.74 - 1648.44] their side like come do my programs you
[1646.10 - 1649.88] don't have to do that and you don't you
[1648.44 - 1651.86] could eat anything you want you could
[1649.88 - 1654.32] eat all the pizzas you want you can eat
[1651.86 - 1658.58] all the vegan pizzas you want it doesn't
[1654.32 - 1661.28] matter too restrictive you know medical
[1658.58 - 1663.86] medium doesn't want you on gluten or
[1661.28 - 1665.36] dairy products he's too restrictive he
[1663.86 - 1667.16] doesn't want you on eggs he's too
[1665.36 - 1669.38] restrictive he doesn't want you on pork
[1667.16 - 1671.90] fat medical medium doesn't want you on
[1669.38 - 1673.52] pork fat he's so restrictive he doesn't
[1671.90 - 1675.08] want you on a stick of butter every day
[1673.52 - 1678.86] so you get a heart attack he's so
[1675.08 - 1681.46] restrictive anyway the point is
[1678.86 - 1683.84] is that the Sharks and the stakes
[1681.46 - 1685.88] Slytherin and swim into the medical mean
[1683.84 - 1689.24] community and they'll say you don't need
[1685.88 - 1690.62] a supplement but hey do my program and
[1689.24 - 1692.66] I'm going to take my supplements
[1690.62 - 1694.30] privately when nobody knows in my
[1692.66 - 1696.92] kitchen at night
[1694.30 - 1698.78] that's what they do the supplements that
[1696.92 - 1701.24] got them better and here's another thing
[1698.78 - 1703.58] a lot of people got better
[1701.24 - 1705.92] a lot of people that rip try to rip
[1703.58 - 1707.66] medical medium down and shade throw
[1705.92 - 1710.24] shade on the medical medium in the
[1707.66 - 1711.70] community they got better through the
[1710.24 - 1715.04] medical medium
[1711.70 - 1717.98] protocols with supplements then then
[1715.04 - 1719.78] they stop citing medical medium and said
[1717.98 - 1721.94] hey come over here you don't have to do
[1719.78 - 1724.52] anything you don't want to do he's so
[1721.94 - 1726.44] restrictive oh yeah you'll hear that
[1724.52 - 1728.60] stuff all the time the wild blueberry
[1726.44 - 1730.70] babe says I needed supplementation
[1728.60 - 1733.52] because of the number of pathogens
[1730.70 - 1736.76] toxins and poisons I've been exposed to
[1733.52 - 1739.10] as well as traumas needed all the help I
[1736.76 - 1741.80] can get grateful for femergy
[1739.10 - 1743.18] and that takes me to another thing
[1741.80 - 1746.00] yeah
[1743.18 - 1747.86] that is so incredible by the way where
[1746.00 - 1749.66] do I get it fearing woman says Where do
[1747.86 - 1752.72] I get it the lemon balm in the other go
[1749.66 - 1756.20] to vimergy.com via's in Victor I am as
[1752.72 - 1757.70] in Mary e r g y.com
[1756.20 - 1759.62] go there you have to order a hundred
[1757.70 - 1761.96] dollars worth of stuff of supplements
[1759.62 - 1763.58] that you need and then you tack on the
[1761.96 - 1765.92] 30 dollar
[1763.58 - 1770.08] free lemon balm
[1765.92 - 1770.08] it's incredible it really is
[1771.10 - 1777.74] cool I love Emoji they are really Game
[1774.62 - 1780.38] Changer even if you can afford just one
[1777.74 - 1783.02] is great you will have healing
[1780.38 - 1786.20] and that's what I mean it's
[1783.02 - 1787.46] it like the propolis is critical it's
[1786.20 - 1792.62] critical for me
[1787.46 - 1795.98] because I put my physical body
[1792.62 - 1796.94] through the mill I run it through the
[1795.98 - 1800.00] mill
[1796.94 - 1801.98] like seriously that's what I do okay
[1800.00 - 1804.32] it's not smart
[1801.98 - 1805.82] I'm not saying that it's a good idea to
[1804.32 - 1808.70] do that it's not
[1805.82 - 1811.64] but that's what I do to keep up with all
[1808.70 - 1812.80] that I got to do I run my I burn myself
[1811.64 - 1816.98] to the ground
[1812.80 - 1818.32] like burn it to the ground and then
[1816.98 - 1823.58] okay
[1818.32 - 1824.60] I use the Vim to restore and build me
[1823.58 - 1827.84] back up
[1824.60 - 1830.60] so I can't hang in there for when I'm up
[1827.84 - 1834.62] against massive stress writing the books
[1830.60 - 1837.56] working hard doing no sleep 20 hour days
[1834.62 - 1840.26] 22 hour days
[1837.56 - 1843.74] and that I want to keep myself strong
[1840.26 - 1845.42] for I do I want to keep myself strong
[1843.74 - 1846.98] so I just want to say like I said
[1845.42 - 1849.98] there's a tremendous amount of fork
[1846.98 - 1852.56] tongue snakes and lizards even though
[1849.98 - 1855.20] you know whatever lizards are probably
[1852.56 - 1857.96] friendly to a point and there's probably
[1855.20 - 1859.82] some friendly snakes out there okay but
[1857.96 - 1861.74] there's some snakes and lizards that
[1859.82 - 1865.16] slide in
[1861.74 - 1866.60] they do and they come on into the
[1865.16 - 1868.10] medical medium Community because you
[1866.60 - 1869.30] know what though it is too that where
[1868.10 - 1871.28] they've made a name for themselves
[1869.30 - 1873.20] through the medical meme community
[1871.28 - 1874.82] by healing themselves with medical meme
[1873.20 - 1877.28] information the books and the protocols
[1874.82 - 1878.90] and then they tell everybody oh don't do
[1877.28 - 1881.66] a supplement don't do this he's
[1878.90 - 1884.00] restrictive oh it's a cult it's a cult
[1881.66 - 1886.40] that's what it is uh really
[1884.00 - 1888.80] okay you know and they'll say whatever
[1886.40 - 1891.26] they're gonna say because they just want
[1888.80 - 1893.00] to shade on everybody but then it chips
[1891.26 - 1894.56] away at everybody and it's Death By A
[1893.00 - 1896.06] Thousand Cuts because it's make or break
[1894.56 - 1898.10] and as somebody just said originally
[1896.06 - 1900.26] earlier they were saying
[1898.10 - 1902.84] that someone persuaded them to stop
[1900.26 - 1905.42] their energy supplements and then their
[1902.84 - 1907.58] health went catastrophic and then they
[1905.42 - 1909.20] had to go back up it's it's it's like
[1907.58 - 1912.26] that out there I've seen this over and
[1909.20 - 1913.88] over again meanwhile which is really
[1912.26 - 1916.64] interesting there's some other
[1913.88 - 1919.46] supplement companies out there that are
[1916.64 - 1922.58] kind of bonding with some of the Sharks
[1919.46 - 1924.98] and some of the snakes yeah because it's
[1922.58 - 1928.76] a compa frequentition
[1924.98 - 1932.06] it's competitive crap out there it's all
[1928.76 - 1933.62] about the medical meme Community how how
[1932.06 - 1937.36] to break into the medical medium
[1933.62 - 1940.70] Community to sell their garbage and crap
[1937.36 - 1942.44] that has a percentage of unjust of
[1940.70 - 1944.36] undisclosed ingredients in it that
[1942.44 - 1945.80] aren't good that has alcohol and citric
[1944.36 - 1947.84] acid and all this garbage in it and
[1945.80 - 1950.24] everything else it has all that stuff
[1947.84 - 1952.46] and doesn't have the quality and that's
[1950.24 - 1953.90] the sad part all on its own anyway I
[1952.46 - 1955.76] want to read about the quickening but I
[1953.90 - 1957.44] just wanted to talk about all this
[1955.76 - 1959.24] I just don't want this company to
[1957.44 - 1961.34] disappear someday
[1959.24 - 1964.94] so I fully endorse them because this
[1961.34 - 1968.12] stuff is that amazing you cannot mess
[1964.94 - 1969.68] with this type of product here it
[1968.12 - 1971.84] doesn't exist anywhere it will never
[1969.68 - 1974.24] exist anywhere else I can honestly tell
[1971.84 - 1975.62] you there's no way in hell ever there's
[1974.24 - 1979.40] going to be a supplement company that's
[1975.62 - 1980.84] going to duplicate this or even try the
[1979.40 - 1981.92] price Point's not going to be there and
[1980.84 - 1984.26] they're not going to be able to do it
[1981.92 - 1986.18] I'm going to tell you right now
[1984.26 - 1989.42] there's not going to be a company in the
[1986.18 - 1991.76] world to actually duplicate that
[1989.42 - 1993.74] propolis pure they'll never go for the
[1991.76 - 1995.18] price point they'll never go for the
[1993.74 - 1996.92] quality they'll never go for the
[1995.18 - 1999.14] carefully screened you know screened
[1996.92 - 2001.66] beekeeper operations they'll never go
[1999.14 - 2003.64] for any of that they won't hands down
[2001.66 - 2005.14] this is the best stuff out there lupus
[2003.64 - 2006.94] free with celery three through three I
[2005.14 - 2009.88] healed my frozen shoulder Frozen
[2006.94 - 2011.86] shoulders awful that's awful so many
[2009.88 - 2013.48] people have suffered from that I healed
[2011.86 - 2016.12] my frozen shoulder with celery juice
[2013.48 - 2018.88] alone but I needed vermergy for so many
[2016.12 - 2020.62] other symptoms and the shock therapy
[2018.88 - 2023.44] which is amazing
[2020.62 - 2025.54] the shock therapies from SOC are
[2023.44 - 2028.60] probably one of my favorite things
[2025.54 - 2030.04] all around are the shock therapies from
[2028.60 - 2032.38] SOC
[2030.04 - 2034.78] I mean nobody in the health realm even
[2032.38 - 2037.12] thought of anything like that no one in
[2034.78 - 2039.70] the health realm anywhere
[2037.12 - 2042.82] knew to do the shock Therapies
[2039.70 - 2045.94] that's Testament alone
[2042.82 - 2048.24] to what's so incredible about SOC and

[2180.52 - 2182.86] so I know we're hitting a lot of
[2181.78 - 2184.36] different topics right here we're
[2182.86 - 2185.74] talking about death by a Thousand Cuts
[2184.36 - 2187.78] we're talking about make or break the
[2185.74 - 2188.92] healing process talk about the Sharks
[2187.78 - 2190.12] and the snakes and the lizards to
[2188.92 - 2192.22] Slither into the medical meme Community
[2190.12 - 2193.60] or already started there they started
[2192.22 - 2195.82] out in the medical meeting Community
[2193.60 - 2197.80] they got known in the medical medium
[2195.82 - 2199.72] community
[2197.80 - 2201.22] and then they just wanted to sell their
[2199.72 - 2203.20] own stuff
[2201.22 - 2205.42] right the programs or whatever it is
[2203.20 - 2207.52] sell their own courses their own classes
[2205.42 - 2209.92] and then they they go with that
[2207.52 - 2212.80] marketing strategy which is don't ever
[2209.92 - 2214.24] ever cite the medical medium be your own
[2212.80 - 2217.06] thing and then they come out and they're
[2214.24 - 2220.36] like don't do this don't do that he's
[2217.06 - 2222.04] he's too restrictive on his Foods
[2220.36 - 2223.36] yeah because I don't want people eating
[2222.04 - 2226.06] pork fat
[2223.36 - 2228.40] so they don't get a heart attack
[2226.06 - 2230.32] all right
[2228.40 - 2231.94] and the other thing too is natural
[2230.32 - 2234.10] flavors just so you know about
[2231.94 - 2236.98] beveraging products they don't have
[2234.10 - 2239.04] what's called natural flavoring natural

[2258.34 - 2263.26] all natural they're even organic well
[2260.44 - 2265.60] people don't realize is the MSG that's

[2277.42 - 2281.74] only company that never ever had it in
[2280.42 - 2283.78] there and there's supplement companies
[2281.74 - 2286.54] out there that are trying to model after
[2283.78 - 2288.28] vimergy right now and they used to have
[2286.54 - 2290.32] natural flavors in their supplements
[2288.28 - 2292.36] just so you know they used to have it in
[2290.32 - 2294.88] there but no one knows about what they
[2292.36 - 2297.34] used to have and then they take it out
[2294.88 - 2299.14] because they're like whoa yeah we better

[2792.58 - 2797.50] for what they put in their mouth life is
[2795.04 - 2798.94] hard and some people say animal protein
[2797.50 - 2801.10] works for them you think I have the

[2881.38 - 2886.78] because that world yes is scary and I've
[2885.04 - 2889.36] seen a lot of people lost in it over the
[2886.78 - 2892.24] years Lisa I was vegan and eating
[2889.36 - 2893.92] healthy and got so sick now I'm vegan
[2892.24 - 2895.54] medical medium style and healing and
[2893.92 - 2896.44] that leads me to one other thing right
[2895.54 - 2900.04] here
[2896.44 - 2902.20] I love when when plant-based
[2900.04 - 2904.42] medical medium Anthony William haters
[2902.20 - 2906.64] there's some plant-based influencers
[2904.42 - 2907.72] that hate medical medium Anthony William
[2906.64 - 2910.30] out there
[2907.72 - 2912.94] right and but they don't realize
[2910.30 - 2914.40] something there are so many plant-based
[2912.94 - 2916.96] people here in medical medium community
[2914.40 - 2920.08] that were doing plant-based but we're
[2916.96 - 2922.06] sick as dogs and they learned that it
[2920.08 - 2924.04] took more than just being plant-based it
[2922.06 - 2926.26] took being plant-based for them and then
[2924.04 - 2927.94] the Learned protocols and shock
[2926.26 - 2929.98] Therapies
[2927.94 - 2932.86] and all kinds of different things it
[2929.98 - 2934.78] took more right and then there's just
[2932.86 - 2936.88] plain old raw vegan movement out there
[2934.78 - 2939.28] or plain old you know plant-based raw
[2936.88 - 2942.34] vegan influencers out there that that
[2939.28 - 2944.56] just crap on MM say it's all like
[2942.34 - 2946.90] whatever a joke say he doesn't have any
[2944.56 - 2949.96] credentials I don't have any credentials
[2946.90 - 2951.52] I'm not a doctor never said I was if I
[2949.96 - 2953.32] had credentials I'd be flaunting the
[2951.52 - 2954.82] many everywhere if I had a certificate
[2953.32 - 2956.68] of being a health coach I'd be saying
[2954.82 - 2958.72] yeah I also have a certificate as a
[2956.68 - 2961.12] health coach why not it would probably
[2958.72 - 2962.62] help me actually but I don't have any
[2961.12 - 2964.36] credentials but what happens is with
[2962.62 - 2967.84] there's plant-based influencers out
[2964.36 - 2970.60] there that hate mm so much
[2967.84 - 2972.76] because they think well they got it all
[2970.60 - 2973.90] down with their plant-based thing when
[2972.76 - 2975.70] they don't realize you can be
[2973.90 - 2977.20] plant-based and sick
[2975.70 - 2979.24] sick
[2977.20 - 2982.42] real sick
[2979.24 - 2983.86] so sick and then learn how to heal while
[2982.42 - 2986.80] still being plant-based because medical
[2983.86 - 2989.02] meme's not against plant-based Lisa says
[2986.80 - 2991.72] I love the propolis so much I don't even
[2989.02 - 2994.24] get sick anymore with the cold because
[2991.72 - 2996.90] every time I feel something I do shock
[2994.24 - 2996.90] Therapies

[3003.12 - 3007.44] I do I do

[3357.78 - 3362.22] sometimes come at a price
[3359.72 - 3365.52] unconsidered vulnerability so Lightning
[3362.22 - 3366.90] Fast advancements also come with a whole
[3365.52 - 3369.30] bunch of stuff
[3366.90 - 3371.58] these changes affect all of humankind
[3369.30 - 3374.70] and women kind especially Bears the
[3371.58 - 3376.92] brunt so women kind Bears the Brunt
[3374.70 - 3379.50] with so much happening with the quick
[3376.92 - 3381.54] the quickening
[3379.50 - 3384.18] it's women who face the greatest
[3381.54 - 3386.94] expectations in our current day
[3384.18 - 3388.74] no no
[3386.94 - 3391.98] disrespect to men
[3388.74 - 3393.18] men also face a lot of crap we know that
[3391.98 - 3396.00] right
[3393.18 - 3398.40] but no no disrespect just acknowledging
[3396.00 - 3401.46] that right now during the quickening
[3398.40 - 3403.20] women really are faced with a lot of
[3401.46 - 3404.64] different expectations in the current
[3403.20 - 3407.10] day
[3404.64 - 3408.36] women whose bodies so often get pushed
[3407.10 - 3411.00] to the brink
[3408.36 - 3414.42] and chronic illness has become such a
[3411.00 - 3416.04] widespread issue for women for men and
[3414.42 - 3418.38] for children
[3416.04 - 3420.78] if we don't interrupt the constant flow
[3418.38 - 3423.12] of misinformation
[3420.78 - 3427.14] then that's what medical medium
[3423.12 - 3430.32] information does it breaks and
[3427.14 - 3432.72] interrupts the flow of constant
[3430.32 - 3434.82] misinformation out there if we don't
[3432.72 - 3436.80] recognize what our four mothers and
[3434.82 - 3439.68] forefathers have gone through and
[3436.80 - 3442.26] redirect our course then the generations
[3439.68 - 3444.72] to come will have to endure unnecessary
[3442.26 - 3448.86] suffering I'm seeing it now I mean when
[3444.72 - 3451.80] I go back 35 years I'm seeing how
[3448.86 - 3456.02] the generations
[3451.80 - 3456.02] have to endure like the new generations
[3456.48 - 3461.10] suffering to keep up with The Changing
[3458.70 - 3464.22] Times to survive we must learn to adapt
[3461.10 - 3466.32] the only way to do that is to protect
[3464.22 - 3468.54] our health
[3466.32 - 3470.58] and not in just
[3468.54 - 3474.36] a ridiculous way
[3470.58 - 3476.94] but in a way that matters and counts
[3474.36 - 3479.34] the popular approach right now in books
[3476.94 - 3481.20] articles and social media and podcasts
[3479.34 - 3484.62] about chronic illness is to advise
[3481.20 - 3486.96] people to eliminate what are theorized
[3484.62 - 3488.88] to be inflammatory foods from their
[3486.96 - 3491.52] diets while making theoretical
[3488.88 - 3493.02] improvements to gut health and that's as
[3491.52 - 3494.82] far as it goes
[3493.02 - 3497.10] the information out there doesn't
[3494.82 - 3499.32] explain what actually causes autoimmune
[3497.10 - 3501.72] disorders or chronic conditions or how
[3499.32 - 3504.36] to rid yourself of the real root
[3501.72 - 3505.98] problems that is why people stay sick I
[3504.36 - 3507.54] don't care how many people have adopted
[3505.98 - 3509.28] the whole inflammatory thing out there
[3507.54 - 3511.26] and they talk about it on podcasts or
[3509.28 - 3515.16] whatever they talk about
[3511.26 - 3517.62] they still don't know the root causes
[3515.16 - 3519.06] but there are genuine explanations for
[3517.62 - 3520.88] the conditions that leave medical
[3519.06 - 3524.04] communities
[3520.88 - 3526.74] in a stagnant place and leave patience
[3524.04 - 3528.84] without answers
[3526.74 - 3531.06] is there such thing as that patients
[3528.84 - 3532.32] without answers
[3531.06 - 3535.26] yeah
[3532.32 - 3539.04] sure is TJ says
[3535.26 - 3542.42] so true aw I'm 59 and scary to see how
[3539.04 - 3542.42] much things have changed
[3543.30 - 3548.22] the illusion is that there is a movement
[3545.58 - 3551.10] in the medical communities
[3548.22 - 3554.04] sorry the illusion
[3551.10 - 3557.64] this is an important word to just
[3554.04 - 3560.10] like digest for a second the illusion
[3557.64 - 3562.26] is that there is movement in medical
[3560.10 - 3564.12] communities understanding of chronic
[3562.26 - 3566.58] illness
[3564.12 - 3569.58] I see some like seriously some some
[3566.58 - 3573.48] really good doctors out there
[3569.58 - 3575.34] doing a lot of stuff trying really hard
[3573.48 - 3576.48] they still don't know why their patients
[3575.34 - 3578.88] are sick
[3576.48 - 3581.94] I hear about it all the time the reality
[3578.88 - 3583.92] is that appearance of advancement often
[3581.94 - 3586.92] comes from false leads and guessing
[3583.92 - 3589.44] games so it's like you what happens is
[3586.92 - 3591.48] when we seek help we're getting kind of
[3589.44 - 3594.50] like
[3591.48 - 3597.18] snowed with smoke and mirrors with
[3594.50 - 3600.42] advancements in health
[3597.18 - 3604.82] but really it's a lot of Flash
[3600.42 - 3604.82] pomp circumstance bells and whistles
[3606.84 - 3612.98] Jackie B says on YouTube this book has
[3609.96 - 3612.98] changed my life
[3613.38 - 3617.58] it's got the collecting Stones
[3614.64 - 3619.56] meditation journey in here but there's
[3617.58 - 3622.92] going to be a lot more
[3619.56 - 3623.94] of that starting on the 19th you get a
[3622.92 - 3626.36] video every day it's going to be
[3623.94 - 3626.36] incredible
[3628.38 - 3631.32] so this is important information right
[3630.24 - 3633.18] now
[3631.32 - 3635.46] the reality is that appearance of
[3633.18 - 3637.74] advancement often comes from false leads
[3635.46 - 3639.18] and guessing games and people are still
[3637.74 - 3641.64] suffering
[3639.18 - 3644.22] still suffering that stagnation doesn't
[3641.64 - 3646.14] need to hold you back anymore there are
[3644.22 - 3650.40] powerful methods to deal with the
[3646.14 - 3652.80] challenges we face in this modern era
[3650.40 - 3655.38] medical meme information is shaped and
[3652.80 - 3657.60] changed Health all on its own just not
[3655.38 - 3659.64] only in the last few decades but
[3657.60 - 3661.68] specifically and especially in the last
[3659.64 - 3663.96] three years last 10 years
[3661.68 - 3665.94] this book is the guide to truly freeing
[3663.96 - 3668.04] yourself
[3665.94 - 3670.80] I've written it so you can truly heal
[3668.04 - 3672.78] and keep yourself from getting sucked
[3670.80 - 3675.18] into the trends and fads and mistakes
[3672.78 - 3677.16] and half truths and errors and
[3675.18 - 3678.84] distractions and deceptions about Health
[3677.16 - 3680.94] and Wellness
[3678.84 - 3682.56] Spirit of compassion has provided this
[3680.94 - 3685.08] information so we can help today's
[3682.56 - 3686.82] children grow into healthy adults
[3685.08 - 3688.62] and here's here's what's interesting I'm
[3686.82 - 3690.18] not against science not against science
[3688.62 - 3693.30] and research
[3690.18 - 3695.28] I'm in no way anti-science far from it
[3693.30 - 3697.86] actually I don't question that the Earth
[3695.28 - 3699.84] is round I hope I don't
[3697.86 - 3701.34] I hope I'm not bothering anybody that
[3699.84 - 3703.44] there's a lot of people that think the
[3701.34 - 3705.86] Earth is flat and I don't judge them on
[3703.44 - 3705.86] any level
[3706.56 - 3711.00] I don't question that the Earth is round
[3708.54 - 3711.96] or that the Earth is billions of years
[3711.00 - 3715.68] old
[3711.96 - 3717.84] or the value of the scientific method
[3715.68 - 3721.32] What Spirit of compassion reveals in
[3717.84 - 3723.36] this book is being read here and as a
[3721.32 - 3724.98] result becoming recognized by the
[3723.36 - 3727.74] scientific Community more and more each
[3724.98 - 3731.64] day so here's what happens scientific
[3727.74 - 3733.92] Community is poaching information that
[3731.64 - 3735.78] was only published out of this book
[3733.92 - 3738.72] right here and the other medical medium
[3735.78 - 3742.08] books but at least science is advancing
[3738.72 - 3743.10] because of this right here this book was
[3742.08 - 3746.10] published
[3743.10 - 3746.10] 2015
[3747.00 - 3753.06] but was already written in the process
[3750.00 - 3756.06] of getting printed in two thousand and
[3753.06 - 3756.06] 13.
[3759.60 - 3765.60] if you or a loved one is sick do you
[3762.12 - 3767.46] feel you have 20 or 30 or 50 years to
[3765.60 - 3768.96] wait for answers very important right
[3767.46 - 3770.70] there so I want to read this little
[3768.96 - 3773.46] section
[3770.70 - 3776.28] the word Quicken doesn't just mean
[3773.46 - 3778.58] become faster
[3776.28 - 3781.56] it also means spring to life
[3778.58 - 3784.26] historically is referred to the first
[3781.56 - 3785.52] signs of movement a fetus showed in the
[3784.26 - 3787.44] womb
[3785.52 - 3789.24] which is to say this time of the
[3787.44 - 3791.82] quickening isn't just about life
[3789.24 - 3793.80] speeding up it's also about rebirth
[3791.82 - 3795.60] so even though things are going faster
[3793.80 - 3797.04] than ever before with the quickening
[3795.60 - 3798.56] right now and we know that I mean you
[3797.04 - 3802.26] guys know just in the last three years
[3798.56 - 3804.36] hasn't things gone a lot faster just in
[3802.26 - 3805.80] the last four years how about the last
[3804.36 - 3808.32] five years
[3805.80 - 3810.66] do you think things were different 10
[3808.32 - 3813.12] years ago than what they are now greatly
[3810.66 - 3815.10] different in so many ways Health with
[3813.12 - 3817.38] Liz good to see you this book is one of
[3815.10 - 3819.48] the most precious to me because of the
[3817.38 - 3821.58] Soul healing chapter I'm so grateful for
[3819.48 - 3823.08] Spirit of compassion for providing this
[3821.58 - 3826.14] info
[3823.08 - 3829.92] thank you health with Liz
[3826.14 - 3831.84] truly I respect your opinion and your
[3829.92 - 3834.80] experience
[3831.84 - 3834.80] and what you say
[3835.92 - 3841.68] aren't we all looking for truth truth
[3839.46 - 3844.38] about our world the universe truth about
[3841.68 - 3846.84] ourselves about life about why we are
[3844.38 - 3848.94] here about our purpose are we not
[3846.84 - 3851.28] looking for truth about all of that
[3848.94 - 3853.56] when we're sick we question ourselves
[3851.28 - 3855.00] how many people question themselves when
[3853.56 - 3858.14] they get sick
[3855.00 - 3858.14] so many people do
[3859.92 - 3864.54] from what we were put on Earth to do we
[3862.26 - 3867.72] doubt basic truths like the body's
[3864.54 - 3870.06] ability to heal because we have haven't
[3867.72 - 3871.56] yet connected to what's really behind
[3870.06 - 3873.54] our illnesses
[3871.56 - 3876.06] we go from Doctor to doctor medical
[3873.54 - 3878.94] community to medical community looking
[3876.06 - 3881.64] for an answer we lose faith in life
[3878.94 - 3885.42] itself and I can't stress that point
[3881.64 - 3887.88] enough so many people lose faith
[3885.42 - 3889.68] when they get sick
[3887.88 - 3893.10] they lose faith
[3889.68 - 3896.28] when we become well doubt melts away we
[3893.10 - 3899.70] have energy to to to devote to our true
[3896.28 - 3903.48] purpose we watch ourselves transform and
[3899.70 - 3905.76] we believe in the good in life again
[3903.48 - 3907.62] we get reacquainted with our path in
[3905.76 - 3910.68] this world we find our way back home
[3907.62 - 3913.38] with peace in our heart and soul
[3910.68 - 3916.68] the truth about the world ourselves life
[3913.38 - 3918.36] purpose it all comes down to healing and
[3916.68 - 3920.16] the truth about healing is now in your
[3918.36 - 3921.60] hands just wanted to read that to you
