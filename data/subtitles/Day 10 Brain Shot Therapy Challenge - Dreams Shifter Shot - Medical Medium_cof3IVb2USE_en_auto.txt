[418.08 - 423.90] you want to use your dreams as a gateway
[421.20 - 425.40] to understand your soul and your Soul's
[423.90 - 428.94] past
[425.40 - 430.68] here's the thing with SOC everything SOC
[428.94 - 433.38] has done and given to me in information
[430.68 - 434.76] throughout the years has literally been
[433.38 - 437.40] true
[434.76 - 438.90] Advanced information the science of
[437.40 - 439.98] research is stealing and poaching from
[438.90 - 441.60] the medical medium books that are
[439.98 - 443.76] published and believe me my Publishers
[441.60 - 446.22] knows this and sees it
[443.76 - 448.14] they see the the plagiarizing out there
[446.22 - 451.02] and the stealing and the thefting right
[448.14 - 452.64] of the mm books but what's incredible is
[451.02 - 454.26] Spirit of compassion
[452.64 - 456.54] has always been right with the
[454.26 - 458.04] information and people have gotten their
[456.54 - 459.48] lives back out of wheelchairs they've
[458.04 - 461.10] gotten rid of the brain fog they've
[459.48 - 462.60] gotten rid of terrible gut problems
[461.10 - 465.60] they've gotten rid of so many things
[462.60 - 468.36] that it's always true so when I read the
[465.60 - 471.06] miracle brain shot therapy right when I
[468.36 - 472.62] read about them in here
[471.06 - 475.56] um the first thing that hits me is like
[472.62 - 476.52] oh my God you can learn from your Soul's
[475.56 - 480.00] past
[476.52 - 482.16] through the dream shifter
[480.00 - 484.92] think about that for a second
[482.16 - 487.14] you want to use your dreams as a gateway
[484.92 - 488.76] to understand your soul and your Soul's
[487.14 - 490.62] past is that not the most mind-blowing
[488.76 - 492.90] thing you've ever heard or is it just me
[490.62 - 494.70] and for some reason I think that way and
[492.90 - 496.62] I'm like oh that's the most mind-blowing
[494.70 - 499.08] thing I've ever heard like
[496.62 - 502.04] and it's just me or do you guys think
[499.08 - 502.04] that's mind-blowing
[502.32 - 505.44] corny M.A says the book blows my mind
[504.30 - 508.14] Hey you made this live just now
[505.44 - 510.42] incredible usually you're working right
[508.14 - 512.64] you want to use your dreams as a gateway
[510.42 - 514.74] to understand your soul and your Soul's
[512.64 - 516.84] Passover let me tell you right there how
[514.74 - 520.98] powerful that is because your Soul's
[516.84 - 523.08] past is before this lifetime so think
[520.98 - 526.14] about that for a second
[523.08 - 529.82] the dream shifter helps us to understand
[526.14 - 535.02] if we want that direction
[529.82 - 536.76] what information from the Soul's past
[535.02 - 540.00] is about
[536.76 - 542.04] that means your soul before this
[540.00 - 544.74] Lifetime right here
[542.04 - 546.32] before your soul
[544.74 - 550.14] ended up
[546.32 - 552.18] magically appearing in the womb
[550.14 - 555.00] think about this
[552.18 - 557.46] okay how about this one now okay you're
[555.00 - 559.26] having difficulty dreaming and wanted
[557.46 - 561.96] dreams so many people I know that they
[559.26 - 564.42] have a difficult time dreaming they want
[561.96 - 567.84] to dream but they can't
[564.42 - 570.42] Erica Malik says the dream shifter gave
[567.84 - 573.72] me such vivid dreams I've always been
[570.42 - 576.20] really connected to my dreams this shot
[573.72 - 579.90] amplifies that on a whole other level
[576.20 - 583.14] that's just incredible
[579.90 - 584.88] here's one right here too okay Lana says
[583.14 - 587.46] these shots have already changed my
[584.88 - 590.16] brain and I can't wait to see where this
[587.46 - 593.82] journey takes me Lana
[590.16 - 597.42] these shots absolutely are miraculous
[593.82 - 600.48] and they have the ability to turn lives
[597.42 - 602.28] around in such a way but don't stop the
[600.48 - 604.32] other medical medium tools even though
[602.28 - 606.18] you can do this tool without doing the
[604.32 - 607.32] other tools you still you still have to
[606.18 - 609.12] learn the books and the information
[607.32 - 610.68] there's so many important tools for
[609.12 - 612.84] different conditions and symptoms all of
[610.68 - 614.64] it with these brain shots it's a whole
[612.84 - 616.26] nother level oh my God especially if
[614.64 - 619.32] you're doing other medical medium tools
[616.26 - 622.32] and you bring these in Tamara says I try
[619.32 - 625.56] dream shifter uh oh really incredible I
[622.32 - 628.50] slept good loud thought finally faded
[625.56 - 630.60] and remember my dream with total with
[628.50 - 634.20] real Clarity or real dream really
[630.60 - 636.96] clarity I had repeated dream
[634.20 - 639.84] from the other night but was introduced
[636.96 - 643.26] with gentleness and not aggression
[639.84 - 646.62] aggressive peppermint makes drink really
[643.26 - 649.14] nice too that's incredible I love that
[646.62 - 650.64] I've been using the dreams shifter
[649.14 - 653.58] periodically
[650.64 - 655.98] I already have some really really crazy
[653.58 - 659.46] dreams and the spirit of compassion
[655.98 - 661.98] talks to me in my sleep on top of it and
[659.46 - 664.62] since I was a child I had the ability to
[661.98 - 667.26] enter someone else's dream
[664.62 - 669.78] and then do things like that and so the
[667.26 - 674.36] dream shifter is actually even giving me
[669.78 - 674.36] more of an ampage with my dream state
[674.58 - 678.30] I haven't been sleeping that many hours
[676.56 - 680.52] lately because I'm keeping up with a
[678.30 - 682.50] billion times work of all this stuff

[799.32 - 806.58] gain more insight into your dreams
[803.10 - 807.84] that's a reason all on its own to do the
[806.58 - 811.14] dream shifter
[807.84 - 814.20] you want to decode the meaning of your
[811.14 - 815.64] dreams how incredible is that gain more
[814.20 - 818.04] insight
[815.64 - 821.52] into your dreams that alone is really
[818.04 - 823.86] powerful okay here's another one too
[821.52 - 825.48] if your dreams are waking you up did you
[823.86 - 828.00] ever have dreams that wait woke you up
[825.48 - 829.62] like the dream is waking you up and you
[828.00 - 832.92] need your sleep but the dream wakes you
[829.62 - 837.30] up that's another reason why to do this
[832.92 - 840.36] so Jackie says I take celery for us when
[837.30 - 842.76] I'm really sleepy and I need to be awake
[840.36 - 845.22] it's great incredible I'm glad you I'm
[842.76 - 846.72] glad you use it it's it's I rely on it I
[845.22 - 849.12] actually rely on it
[846.72 - 852.06] Marge just says what Gaba and cellular
[849.12 - 854.10] Force are you what are you doing for you
[852.06 - 855.96] well it's the Imaging
[854.10 - 858.00] so
[855.96 - 861.90] that's the Gaba right there it's V as in
[858.00 - 863.58] Victor I Amazon Mary e r g y.com
[861.90 - 865.92] I endorsed them because of the four
[863.58 - 867.72] reasons so the four reasons are
[865.92 - 869.04] mind-blowing I don't have time to talk
[867.72 - 870.48] about it though but there's four
[869.04 - 872.10] incredible reasons that nobody does
[870.48 - 873.96] nobody has
[872.10 - 875.82] Lucas says I know celery force is
[873.96 - 877.08] amazing it totally is it's actually
[875.82 - 879.06] probably
[877.08 - 880.50] when people don't realize like for me in
[879.06 - 885.24] my personal life some of the things that
[880.50 - 888.96] I do and and like celery Force I rely on
[885.24 - 890.58] it's how I survive a day that's how I
[888.96 - 892.26] feel it's the craziest thing because I
[890.58 - 894.24] wake up at four or five in the morning I
[892.26 - 895.62] go all the way till midnight I try to
[894.24 - 897.42] get three or four hours of sleep but if
[895.62 - 899.46] it's really heavy duty work time
[897.42 - 901.02] schedule I'll get two hours of sleep one
[899.46 - 903.72] hour sometimes when I did the book it
[901.02 - 906.36] was like barely any Pamela says on
[903.72 - 910.04] YouTube I've been buying the demorgy and
[906.36 - 913.28] tossing the other things I'm I'm
[910.04 - 916.62] streaming and cleansing
[913.28 - 916.93] my some reason the comments are just all
[916.62 - 919.92] like
[916.93 - 922.08] [Music]
[919.92 - 923.16] streaming and cleansing my kitchen okay
[922.08 - 925.08] cool
[923.16 - 929.06] streamlining and cleansing my kitchen
[925.08 - 931.50] haha sorry sorry I butchered the comment
[929.06 - 934.32] the crazy stuff with the tech was
[931.50 - 935.94] happening at the same time pernella says
[934.32 - 937.26] celery Force really helps my brain to
[935.94 - 940.08] work better
[937.26 - 942.96] I rely on it I actually use it as a
[940.08 - 945.12] crutch I mean I don't have to use it but
[942.96 - 946.62] I use it as a crutch to push harder
[945.12 - 950.34] because
[946.62 - 953.34] um I I can't stop working so what I do
[950.34 - 957.30] is I wanna see because I burn the candle
[953.34 - 959.34] four ends so then I do the cheat and I
[957.30 - 962.48] use the celery Force so I could burn the
[959.34 - 964.92] candle at five ends because because
[962.48 - 967.26] that's what I want to do
[964.92 - 970.32] Jackie says celery Force helps if you
[967.26 - 972.72] don't get a lot of sleep that's my life
[970.32 - 973.92] story that's my life story so anyway
[972.72 - 975.60] that's what it is for you guys know
[973.92 - 978.54] about that anyway you know about that
[975.60 - 980.34] it's feas and Victor i m e r g y.com you
[978.54 - 982.26] guys know about it I do the Gabba right
[980.34 - 983.58] before I go live by the way ask your
[982.26 - 986.10] doctor what's right for you I'm just
[983.58 - 988.38] saying that that's what I do but man do
[986.10 - 989.82] I do I lean up and the thing is it's the
[988.38 - 992.22] four things
[989.82 - 994.56] that no other company I don't care who
[992.22 - 996.30] what how does you guys have talked about
[994.56 - 998.10] in the past it's it's mind-blowing this
[996.30 - 1000.86] company that's why I endorsed them all
[998.10 - 1002.66] right dream shifter
[1000.86 - 1004.76] just a little window into like what I'm
[1002.66 - 1006.08] doing for myself so you guys actually
[1004.76 - 1007.34] know what's happening it's a friend of
[1006.08 - 1009.32] mine was like why don't you tell them
[1007.34 - 1011.18] right before you go on you take it
[1009.32 - 1013.34] literally a minute before you go on
[1011.18 - 1015.68] every time okay
[1013.34 - 1018.14] you're fearful of going to sleep how
[1015.68 - 1020.72] many people do you know that were afraid
[1018.14 - 1022.40] to go to sleep like you got fear and
[1020.72 - 1025.40] anxiety creeps up so like fear and
[1022.40 - 1027.50] anxiety creeps up before going to sleep
[1025.40 - 1029.48] right Pinellas the cellular Force brings
[1027.50 - 1032.00] Clarity to foggy brain
[1029.48 - 1035.18] that that's my experience as far as like
[1032.00 - 1038.00] anybody I've told it told about doctors
[1035.18 - 1039.80] I tell about my experiences I hear the
[1038.00 - 1040.76] same thing from different doctors my
[1039.80 - 1042.68] patient
[1040.76 - 1043.94] you know feels better my face patient
[1042.68 - 1046.40] feels better with this but it's it's
[1043.94 - 1048.70] incredible
[1046.40 - 1051.56] so yeah so you guys anyway
[1048.70 - 1053.48] fearfulness of falling asleep what do
[1051.56 - 1055.22] you think about that
[1053.48 - 1057.26] did you ever experience that in your
[1055.22 - 1059.72] life did oh you get that so Robinson
[1057.26 - 1061.52] says yes I get so you do get that like a
[1059.72 - 1063.98] fearfulness in falling asleep so many
[1061.52 - 1066.62] people have this fear that comes over
[1063.98 - 1068.96] them right before they fall asleep or as
[1066.62 - 1071.30] they fall asleep and that's really
[1068.96 - 1072.80] difficult for a lot of people Terry
[1071.30 - 1074.24] Appleman says love the energy Southern
[1072.80 - 1076.04] Force
[1074.24 - 1078.74] I mean I love it I can't live without it
[1076.04 - 1081.32] you know and but yeah it's it's happens
[1078.74 - 1083.66] to so many people all right
[1081.32 - 1085.64] you're trying to reach others through
[1083.66 - 1087.20] your dreams
[1085.64 - 1089.66] do you ever want to reach anybody
[1087.20 - 1092.96] through your dreams
[1089.66 - 1094.82] it's an incredible experience
[1092.96 - 1096.32] since I was younger that I had that
[1094.82 - 1099.44] ability to do that
[1096.32 - 1101.24] and but the dream shifter can help other
[1099.44 - 1102.86] people and I'm gonna go into like what
[1101.24 - 1106.22] it unlocks like how does the dream
[1102.86 - 1108.98] shifter even work in here in the Noggin
[1106.22 - 1110.42] and so that would be so cool you're
[1108.98 - 1112.58] trying to reach others through your
[1110.42 - 1114.32] dreams how cool is that
[1112.58 - 1116.72] here's one right here
[1114.32 - 1119.90] you're trying to enter other people's
[1116.72 - 1122.66] dreams you got that one right we talked
[1119.90 - 1125.18] about that you're not sleeping enough
[1122.66 - 1127.46] this shot can help you heal through your
[1125.18 - 1129.08] dream process in the short amount of
[1127.46 - 1131.90] sleep you're getting so if you're not
[1129.08 - 1134.18] sleeping that much dream shifter's
[1131.90 - 1136.46] critical because it can help you heal
[1134.18 - 1140.06] and do what you need to do in that short
[1136.46 - 1141.92] amount of sleep you get which is the
[1140.06 - 1143.84] reason I've been using the dream shifter
[1141.92 - 1145.10] for myself personally because I don't
[1143.84 - 1146.96] get a lot of sleep because I'm working
[1145.10 - 1149.42] too many hours I have so many demands
[1146.96 - 1153.14] and responsibilities it's insane
[1149.42 - 1155.06] and and because of that you know I get
[1153.14 - 1157.76] only this amount of sleep I mean to do
[1155.06 - 1160.22] these two massive Bibles
[1157.76 - 1163.10] to do these two massive Bibles right
[1160.22 - 1165.32] here what it took this would take a
[1163.10 - 1166.88] health author like seven years in their
[1165.32 - 1168.50] life just to get something like this
[1166.88 - 1170.24] done and of course it wouldn't be from
[1168.50 - 1171.86] information from above it would just be
[1170.24 - 1175.76] whatever gathered information from
[1171.86 - 1176.90] whatever but the point is is I've lost a
[1175.76 - 1178.22] lot of sleep because of it it's
[1176.90 - 1180.80] incredible
[1178.22 - 1183.02] Lucy Cohn oh my God incredible you're
[1180.80 - 1185.78] here been doing this shot almost every
[1183.02 - 1187.94] night for the challenge and it's helped
[1185.78 - 1190.34] me fall asleep without needing to be on
[1187.94 - 1192.56] my phone something I've struggled with
[1190.34 - 1194.42] for decades that's incredible let's see
[1192.56 - 1197.90] amazing
[1194.42 - 1199.52] my God that's that's incredible
[1197.90 - 1201.08] so
[1199.52 - 1203.78] here's another one Monica the dream
[1201.08 - 1205.04] shifter shot is amazing when done before
[1203.78 - 1207.38] bed
[1205.04 - 1209.66] better sleep and able to remember my
[1207.38 - 1212.36] dreams more vividly love this brain shot
[1209.66 - 1215.66] incredible
[1212.36 - 1217.94] I mean when I think about what was given
[1215.66 - 1219.62] to us right like I'm the messenger and I
[1217.94 - 1221.60] want to get this information out when I
[1219.62 - 1223.82] think about what was given to me because
[1221.60 - 1226.16] I can use these too and that was on
[1223.82 - 1227.72] Instagram those comments you guys I can
[1226.16 - 1230.06] use this too
[1227.72 - 1231.98] like and it's given to all of us when I
[1230.06 - 1233.72] think about like how powerful is that
[1231.98 - 1235.22] all of it

[1235.22 - 1240.56] Karen says Karen Churchill says just SOC

[1518.00 - 1521.48] can figure out
[1519.50 - 1523.16] that these brain shots are composed of
[1521.48 - 1524.96] specific combinations of ingredients
[1523.16 - 1526.88] working together systematically for
[1524.96 - 1528.74] specific reasons that only a source
[1526.88 - 1530.96] above could know no one would know that
[1528.74 - 1532.94] the relationships among these
[1530.96 - 1535.22] ingredients are intricate and unknown to
[1532.94 - 1537.20] anyone the relationship among these
[1535.22 - 1539.30] ingredients are unknown to anyone you
[1537.20 - 1544.06] guys
[1539.30 - 1544.06] hence why a miracle can happen
[1544.10 - 1548.54] that's why a miracle can happen that's

[1568.64 - 1572.24] among these ingredients are unknown to
[1570.56 - 1574.58] anyone until now the knowledge from
[1572.24 - 1577.70] above has remained untapped it has been
[1574.58 - 1580.46] remained it has been remained untapped
[1577.70 - 1583.46] if that makes any sense
[1580.46 - 1583.46] so
[1584.96 - 1589.58] the whole point you guys is it hasn't

[1675.38 - 1680.00] bit to you guys
[1677.12 - 1683.36] everyday toxins and poisons
[1680.00 - 1686.54] inside the brain or a large part of the
[1683.36 - 1690.74] brain limitations we experience
[1686.54 - 1691.82] we have brain limitations because our
[1690.74 - 1695.24] brain
[1691.82 - 1697.28] gets filled with all the poisons and the
[1695.24 - 1699.08] junk and all the garbage
[1697.28 - 1700.94] Brenda said so true what you're saying
[1699.08 - 1702.46] aw we've enjoyed watching how they
[1700.94 - 1704.60] affect my husband
[1702.46 - 1707.12] amazing because your husband probably
[1704.60 - 1708.56] doesn't believe right and but but yet
[1707.12 - 1710.78] you give it to your husband and it's
[1708.56 - 1712.76] like there's a profound effect
[1710.78 - 1714.74] Sarah Anthony these are literally the
[1712.76 - 1717.38] best books of all time
[1714.74 - 1719.24] dreamed I had five copies of each that's
[1717.38 - 1721.54] incredible that's actually the best
[1719.24 - 1721.54] dream
[1722.30 - 1726.98] thank you for recognizing they're the
[1724.40 - 1728.90] best best books of all time
[1726.98 - 1731.18] they're the greatest books in history
[1728.90 - 1734.00] and health
[1731.18 - 1735.74] Evan says is there a dosage or ounces of
[1734.00 - 1737.48] the shots that can be given to kids
[1735.74 - 1741.52] check out the books and look into it and
[1737.48 - 1741.52] you can look into it I honestly
[1741.68 - 1745.94] and Christian says the brain shots are
[1743.96 - 1748.10] going to bring them bring the
[1745.94 - 1751.04] non-believers to mm info because the
[1748.10 - 1753.20] results yes that's the whole point
[1751.04 - 1754.64] we want everybody to heal even somebody
[1753.20 - 1756.98] that doesn't believe in it you still
[1754.64 - 1759.38] want them to heal you still want them to
[1756.98 - 1761.96] find the information and get better
[1759.38 - 1764.42] that's what we want
[1761.96 - 1767.00] everyday toxins and poisons inside the
[1764.42 - 1769.34] brain are a large part of the brain
[1767.00 - 1771.40] limitations we have
[1769.34 - 1774.86] including emotional limitations
[1771.40 - 1777.56] including emotional emotional
[1774.86 - 1780.62] limitations
[1777.56 - 1782.60] because of poisons and toxins clouding
[1780.62 - 1784.34] up our brain
[1782.60 - 1786.74] you guys see where I'm going the dream
[1784.34 - 1790.04] shifter I think some of you guys can
[1786.74 - 1793.28] guess the dream shifter
[1790.04 - 1795.56] can reroute reset and rewire the brain
[1793.28 - 1797.18] because the brain's filled with so many
[1795.56 - 1800.36] different toxins and poisons that it
[1797.18 - 1803.02] clouds up everything we're on page 93 of
[1800.36 - 1803.02] brain saver
[1803.84 - 1806.38] there
[1807.38 - 1811.58] if an area of the brain is clouded up
[1809.66 - 1813.80] with an abundant level of poisons and
[1811.58 - 1815.72] toxins ranging from toxic heavy metals
[1813.80 - 1817.28] to solvents to Plastics you guys are
[1815.72 - 1820.58] like I don't got any of that in my head
[1817.28 - 1823.76] some of you oh no yeah you do
[1820.58 - 1825.62] and other petroleum petrochemicals to
[1823.76 - 1828.14] Pharmaceuticals a lot of people got
[1825.62 - 1830.30] Pharmaceuticals in their brain they just
[1828.14 - 1832.66] do they got a lot of pharmaceuticals in
[1830.30 - 1832.66] their brain
[1832.76 - 1837.32] to air fresheners
[1835.04 - 1838.64] to fragrances the scented candles and
[1837.32 - 1840.32] Beyond
[1838.64 - 1842.84] and that's just theming a few of the
[1840.32 - 1845.26] toxins and poisons that area of the
[1842.84 - 1845.26] brain
[1849.02 - 1852.80] okay
[1850.24 - 1855.62] that area of the brain that's clouded
[1852.80 - 1857.36] with these poisons and toxins the brain
[1855.62 - 1860.14] betrayers I call them can almost go into
[1857.36 - 1860.14] a sleep mode
[1860.66 - 1865.94] but you're not sleeping this doesn't
[1862.94 - 1867.80] mean we'll be sleeping
[1865.94 - 1869.36] it means an area of our brain is not
[1867.80 - 1871.34] functioning optimally so that's the
[1869.36 - 1873.14] whole thing so we walk around
[1871.34 - 1875.48] where
[1873.14 - 1878.44] an area of our brain is not functioning
[1875.48 - 1878.44] great
[1878.78 - 1884.96] so a area may not be functioning right
[1882.38 - 1886.64] another area may not be functioning
[1884.96 - 1890.24] right different areas in the brain
[1886.64 - 1891.86] because we have so much stuff in there
[1890.24 - 1894.80] this is why the dream shifter is
[1891.86 - 1896.72] actually really important
[1894.80 - 1898.34] this is also why
[1896.72 - 1900.86] the rest of the medical beam information
[1898.34 - 1902.60] is also really important too to get rid
[1900.86 - 1906.34] of a lot of these poisons and toxins
[1902.60 - 1906.34] including Metals out of our brain
[1906.74 - 1911.42] so this doesn't mean we'll be sleeping
[1909.14 - 1914.30] it means an area of our brain is not
[1911.42 - 1916.16] functioning great so we'll rely more on
[1914.30 - 1918.50] other parts of our brain that are less
[1916.16 - 1920.48] clouded and clogged up with toxins it
[1918.50 - 1923.98] also means we'll be limited in brain
[1920.48 - 1923.98] function here's how it works
[1924.92 - 1930.20] foreign
[1926.00 - 1933.44] if we have poisons and toxins in an area
[1930.20 - 1937.40] in our brain
[1933.44 - 1939.76] our brain has to rely on another area to
[1937.40 - 1939.76] function
[1940.28 - 1946.54] certain areas in our brain
[1943.16 - 1946.54] go into sleep mode
[1946.76 - 1951.62] because there's too many poisons and
[1948.62 - 1953.78] toxins in certain areas
[1951.62 - 1955.40] so that little bit of tissue in the
[1953.78 - 1957.32] brain
[1955.40 - 1959.60] where all those neurons are in glial
[1957.32 - 1961.82] cells
[1959.60 - 1964.94] dumb down
[1961.82 - 1967.24] and go into kind of like a non-active
[1964.94 - 1967.24] mode
[1967.58 - 1973.94] then our brain
[1970.22 - 1976.42] has to rely on the areas that actually
[1973.94 - 1976.42] work
[1977.18 - 1982.40] and so a switch happens inside our brain
[1980.12 - 1985.76] for survival
[1982.40 - 1987.62] we have to rely on the good parts of our
[1985.76 - 1989.84] brain meaning the parts that are not all
[1987.62 - 1992.72] clouded up and filled with garbage and
[1989.84 - 1995.66] junk and poisons
[1992.72 - 1997.34] in order to survive function and fight
[1995.66 - 1999.92] our way through every day it's why
[1997.34 - 2002.14] people are on caffeine
[1999.92 - 2004.18] parts of their brain aren't quite
[2002.14 - 2007.12] working so great
[2004.18 - 2009.10] so they have to do caffeine
[2007.12 - 2012.60] to try to push their way through it they
[2009.10 - 2012.60] have to drug their brain
[2014.50 - 2020.02] when emotional centers of the brain
[2017.20 - 2023.44] become filled up and clouded with toxins
[2020.02 - 2026.92] and poisons we become more reliant on
[2023.44 - 2029.14] other parts of our brain as a result we
[2026.92 - 2031.42] can become limited in our emotional
[2029.14 - 2032.56] understandings of others so what happens
[2031.42 - 2035.20] is
[2032.56 - 2037.18] the more we get filled up with junk and
[2035.20 - 2040.20] garbage and toxins and poisons inside
[2037.18 - 2040.20] our brain tissue
[2040.24 - 2046.78] the more we lose that understanding
[2044.32 - 2047.80] of like what's going on around us so
[2046.78 - 2052.02] much
[2047.80 - 2052.02] we don't pick up unsubtleties
[2052.30 - 2056.92] we end up going into some depression
[2054.28 - 2060.52] some anxiety some depersonalization
[2056.92 - 2062.98] we have a hard time reading things
[2060.52 - 2064.18] not words but just reading the
[2062.98 - 2067.98] environment
[2064.18 - 2067.98] reading others around us
[2070.90 - 2076.96] we can become Limited in getting in
[2073.60 - 2079.54] touch with our own emotional state we
[2076.96 - 2081.82] can actually have limitations on our own
[2079.54 - 2083.56] emotional state understanding our own
[2081.82 - 2086.26] emotional state like why am I doing that
[2083.56 - 2088.18] how come I'm like this how come I'm
[2086.26 - 2090.10] getting this diagnosis
[2088.18 - 2092.44] how come I feel like I have brain fog
[2090.10 - 2094.42] and brain problems how come I don't
[2092.44 - 2096.58] understand what that person's saying how
[2094.42 - 2100.86] come I'm angry all the time how come I'm
[2096.58 - 2100.86] so moody and Confused
[2102.88 - 2106.42] Jenny Jenn says it's scary to think
[2104.62 - 2107.98] about how these chemicals and toxins
[2106.42 - 2110.44] have changed their personalities and
[2107.98 - 2111.22] made us less than what we were meant to
[2110.44 - 2114.12] be
[2111.22 - 2114.12] it really is
[2114.94 - 2120.70] we can become Limited in feeling and
[2117.46 - 2122.74] expressing emotions too too many toxins
[2120.70 - 2125.86] and poisons in our brain makes it so we
[2122.74 - 2128.02] have a hard time expressing ourselves
[2125.86 - 2129.76] that makes it hard have you ever had
[2128.02 - 2132.04] that happen in your life where it's a
[2129.76 - 2134.08] hard time to express yourself and then
[2132.04 - 2135.90] the other person you're expressing
[2134.08 - 2137.80] yourself to
[2135.90 - 2141.48] misunderstands you
[2137.80 - 2141.48] so you're misunderstood
[2142.60 - 2146.80] and that's a whole nother thing that
[2144.58 - 2148.90] could happen
[2146.80 - 2152.14] we can become Limited in feeling
[2148.90 - 2154.72] expressing our emotions Limited in
[2152.14 - 2158.08] harnessing emotions too like harnessing
[2154.72 - 2161.08] the emotion like not reacting when we
[2158.08 - 2162.52] get taken over by the emotion you know
[2161.08 - 2164.62] when you're just like what did that
[2162.52 - 2167.14] person do what did that person say to me
[2164.62 - 2169.72] I've been hurt and it's hard to wrap our
[2167.14 - 2172.00] heads around it and kind of control that
[2169.72 - 2173.92] right but yours says oh my God not even
[2172.00 - 2175.48] any doctor can explain the way you are
[2173.92 - 2179.32] doing aw
[2175.48 - 2181.42] thank you so much for these books
[2179.32 - 2185.22] I think SOC
[2181.42 - 2190.72] I mean yeah I had to be the implement
[2185.22 - 2192.28] soc's tool and Implement in messenger
[2190.72 - 2194.70] Brenda says is this the reason for
[2192.28 - 2194.70] narcissism
[2197.08 - 2200.32] well yeah our brain can get completely
[2198.88 - 2202.42] filled up with metals and everything
[2200.32 - 2204.58] else absolutely and we can do that but
[2202.42 - 2208.84] you know we also have a soul in there
[2204.58 - 2210.40] too keep that in mind we have a soul
[2208.84 - 2212.62] and we have a Consciousness and
[2210.40 - 2214.12] subconsciousness and physical brain we
[2212.62 - 2216.28] have all four of those things and
[2214.12 - 2218.02] anything go wrong I talk about that in
[2216.28 - 2220.60] the books and we also have a free will
[2218.02 - 2222.76] and a free will can also be involved
[2220.60 - 2224.68] there too but yes clouded up with all
[2222.76 - 2226.72] the poisons junk and garbage definitely
[2224.68 - 2229.56] can send us into a lane that could even
[2226.72 - 2229.56] be narcissistic
[2230.62 - 2235.24] toxins and poisons clogging the
[2232.78 - 2237.10] emotional centers of our brain
[2235.24 - 2239.14] can also mean
[2237.10 - 2241.90] that we become extremely emotional
[2239.14 - 2244.30] without understanding why why am I so
[2241.90 - 2245.80] emotional
[2244.30 - 2250.00] why
[2245.80 - 2253.06] am I so darn emotional
[2250.00 - 2256.06] I get triggered so easy
[2253.06 - 2259.30] I got a triggers list up to here
[2256.06 - 2262.60] and every time someone triggers that or
[2259.30 - 2266.08] something triggers that I'm set off
[2262.60 - 2269.32] I'm crying I'm upset I'm sad I'm
[2266.08 - 2272.10] depressed anxiety gets up
[2269.32 - 2272.10] I'm hurt
[2276.40 - 2282.58] but I don't know why
[2278.80 - 2284.98] I just don't know why
[2282.58 - 2287.56] dreams can become very intense it's
[2284.98 - 2291.04] another comment here Carrie Miller mm
[2287.56 - 2292.96] these shots have changed my life yay
[2291.04 - 2294.58] I can't tell you I want to jump up and

[2668.98 - 2673.00] the brain tissue itself from any kind of
[2671.38 - 2676.20] thing that happened in your life that
[2673.00 - 2676.20] was emotionally difficult
[2676.68 - 2680.64] healing is happening
[2683.68 - 2689.02] hence
[2686.02 - 2693.40] the dream shifter
[2689.02 - 2697.00] we need help with that healing
[2693.40 - 2699.10] if you have any kind of emotionally
[2697.00 - 2700.72] struggling or any kind of emotional
[2699.10 - 2703.66] struggle or something to happen in your
[2700.72 - 2705.22] life a loss or something difficult or a
[2703.66 - 2708.52] hardship or anything in your life
[2705.22 - 2710.20] betrayal broken trust or just anything
[2708.52 - 2712.18] and for some reason the emotional
[2710.20 - 2713.38] centers of the brain is still injured in
[2712.18 - 2715.36] there
[2713.38 - 2717.70] and it hasn't healed and you're having
[2715.36 - 2719.02] difficult dreams struggles in your
[2717.70 - 2722.44] dreams problems with your dreams
[2719.02 - 2725.02] torturous dreams whatever it is going on
[2722.44 - 2726.82] it's you your body your Consciousness
[2725.02 - 2730.12] your subconscious your soul trying to
[2726.82 - 2732.10] heal but we need extra help so what SOC
[2730.12 - 2733.12] did what Spirit of compassion did from
[2732.10 - 2735.16] above
[2733.12 - 2736.60] Spirit of compassion just told me just
[2735.16 - 2738.58] now somebody just glazed their eyes over
[2736.60 - 2740.68] when they heard that someone who's here
[2738.58 - 2742.48] doesn't believe I'm talking to anyone
[2740.68 - 2745.54] and just thinks I'm a really smart guy
[2742.48 - 2747.40] and I was able to somehow comprise these
[2745.54 - 2749.62] books with information
[2747.40 - 2751.66] that's okay I still want you to be here
[2749.62 - 2754.42] you don't have to believe I'm just a
[2751.66 - 2756.82] messenger you can believe I'm a genius
[2754.42 - 2758.68] trust me I'm not a genius
[2756.82 - 2760.84] and even a genius wouldn't have this
[2758.68 - 2763.66] wouldn't know what even a genius
[2760.84 - 2764.98] couldn't breathe this this this line of
[2763.66 - 2767.02] books here
[2764.98 - 2768.82] that the prophecies in these books don't
[2767.02 - 2770.44] even it's not even possible a genius
[2768.82 - 2772.84] couldn't do it but thank you for
[2770.44 - 2774.40] thinking I'm a smart guy I'm honored but
[2772.84 - 2776.02] yes it came from above all right let's
[2774.40 - 2778.24] move on past that when I get information
[2776.02 - 2779.98] from SOC while we're doing this
[2778.24 - 2781.90] sometimes I can't help but to put my two
[2779.98 - 2784.90] cents in
[2781.90 - 2788.14] Okay so
[2784.90 - 2791.56] what's happening is is we need that
[2788.14 - 2793.36] extra help so that's why I got the
[2791.56 - 2794.92] information from it but was given to me
[2793.36 - 2796.72] because so many people struggle with
[2794.92 - 2799.00] their dreams from emotional wounds and
[2796.72 - 2802.06] need the extra push they need the extra
[2799.00 - 2805.20] help in rewiring and resetting
[2802.06 - 2805.20] how incredible is that
[2807.58 - 2811.72] it's not my first walk in the park
[2809.92 - 2813.52] I've been discriminated against because
[2811.72 - 2817.24] of hearing a voice
[2813.52 - 2819.28] I've been whatever I'm not treated
[2817.24 - 2820.72] kindly because of it I got a kick me
[2819.28 - 2822.46] sign on my back it's not my first walk
[2820.72 - 2823.96] in the park so not my first rodeo with
[2822.46 - 2825.22] it so it's okay if you don't believe any
[2823.96 - 2827.74] of it but I want you to stay here
[2825.22 - 2830.14] because I want you oh half time because

[3124.26 - 3128.58] I mean it is scripture from above it's
[3126.42 - 3130.50] worth repeating
[3128.58 - 3132.18] people who have more toxins in the
[3130.50 - 3133.86] emotional centers of the brain tend to
[3132.18 - 3135.84] dream about drowning being in water
[3133.86 - 3138.12] playing in water or being trapped in
[3135.84 - 3139.86] water whether ocean
[3138.12 - 3143.88] weather Ocean
[3139.86 - 3146.76] Pool lake or river
[3143.88 - 3149.82] because their emotional state is in a
[3146.76 - 3152.88] way underwater with toxins Who would
[3149.82 - 3157.02] know that anywhere no scientists nothing
[3152.88 - 3158.28] it's that's from above it blows my mind
[3157.02 - 3160.62] foreign
[3158.28 - 3163.08] the one cool thing about suffering
[3160.62 - 3164.70] through the the taking the every word
[3163.08 - 3166.62] for word from above and doing these
[3164.70 - 3168.90] books and the amount of hours and the
[3166.62 - 3171.12] sacrifices like I made I made
[3168.90 - 3173.46] unbelievable sacrifices that someday I
[3171.12 - 3175.44] may talk about it
[3173.46 - 3177.54] um but unbelievable unbelievable
[3175.44 - 3178.56] sacrifices I get emotional choked up
[3177.54 - 3182.88] about it
[3178.56 - 3184.56] to do this and but at least I get my
[3182.88 - 3186.54] mind blown all the time by the
[3184.56 - 3188.16] information I mean that's cool and of
[3186.54 - 3189.66] course the most important part I see you
[3188.16 - 3191.94] guys healing through the medical medium
[3189.66 - 3196.26] books all eight of them that right there
[3191.94 - 3200.60] is is that's worth pain and suffering uh
[3196.26 - 3200.60] for me in my life okay you ready
[3202.08 - 3206.28] they can also have dreams of running
[3204.24 - 3208.26] from people like we talked about not
[3206.28 - 3210.54] being able to get away when someone's
[3208.26 - 3212.58] trying to kill or harm them
[3210.54 - 3215.22] while these dreams can have other
[3212.58 - 3217.26] meanings many times they occur because
[3215.22 - 3221.22] toxins are in emotional centers of the
[3217.26 - 3223.80] brain we have poisons in the area of the
[3221.22 - 3226.08] brain where emotions are harbored inside
[3223.80 - 3228.38] the neurons and so that's why this
[3226.08 - 3228.38] happens
[3229.92 - 3235.76] May that hopefully that happens someday
[3232.32 - 3235.76] may I saw your comment
[3238.08 - 3243.60] so
[3239.94 - 3246.36] basically what I'm trying to say I will

[3246.36 - 3251.64] in a half egg shell no let's not get it
[3249.42 - 3253.74] in an eggshell
[3251.64 - 3255.78] all right we'll put this
[3253.74 - 3258.18] straight
[3255.78 - 3260.58] the dream shifter
[3258.18 - 3262.44] is there
[3260.58 - 3265.50] quickly
[3262.44 - 3269.84] shoot a bolt of Medicine
[3265.50 - 3269.84] into the emotional center of the brain
[3270.12 - 3276.12] to help
[3272.12 - 3279.66] relocate toxins appropriately
[3276.12 - 3282.48] because what it does is it goes right to
[3279.66 - 3285.14] the emotional center of the brain
[3282.48 - 3285.14] fast
[3285.66 - 3293.88] and starts to move toxins out of the way
[3289.74 - 3296.58] along with rewiring and resetting

[3472.38 - 3478.92] and reset shot but it allows the toxins
[3476.04 - 3481.62] to be removed easier through other
[3478.92 - 3483.72] medical medium tools like your celery

[3531.54 - 3536.88] it really is when I think about it
[3535.08 - 3539.22] it's mind-blowing just talking about it
[3536.88 - 3540.36] well that's a thing you know
[3539.22 - 3543.44] like really
[3540.36 - 3546.54] it's mind blown just talking about it
[3543.44 - 3551.04] she conscious says I thought the shots

[3557.52 - 3562.14] the shot and mix it in your celery juice
[3559.14 - 3563.52] wait 15 to 30 minutes before you do the
[3562.14 - 3566.10] one or the other
[3563.52 - 3569.00] all right half piece of Ginger there
[3566.10 - 3569.00] half inch
[3569.34 - 3573.24] get that in there
[3570.96 - 3576.00] boom
[3573.24 - 3578.34] Carrie Pearson says my new omega mm-1500
[3576.00 - 3579.96] arrived last night lucky you ordered it
[3578.34 - 3582.84] on the third day of the challenge so
[3579.96 - 3583.56] excited to use it Carrie
[3582.84 - 3586.02] um
[3583.56 - 3589.56] it it's it's an incredible juicer what
[3586.02 - 3592.50] you'll notice is the pulp comes out dry
[3589.56 - 3595.44] like very dry it's squeezing harder
[3592.50 - 3597.60] there's compression making sure that as
[3595.44 - 3599.94] much juice can come out the other
[3597.60 - 3601.68] juicers don't do that
[3599.94 - 3603.60] I know the other juicer companies the
[3601.68 - 3605.82] sharks that got into the community they
[3603.60 - 3607.68] think everybody's rich
[3605.82 - 3609.24] because they're not squeezing all the
[3607.68 - 3611.34] juice out like these are
[3609.24 - 3612.96] and so these save money and you actually
[3611.34 - 3615.72] pay for the juicer over and over again
[3612.96 - 3618.54] like the savings pays for the juicer but
[3615.72 - 3620.12] right now the MLM slash affiliate sharks
[3618.54 - 3622.44] brought the juicers in the mm community
[3620.12 - 3624.66] and everybody's getting tricked by the
[3622.44 - 3626.58] by The Flash and the Frills and chills
[3624.66 - 3629.76] but don't realize this is a slow
[3626.58 - 3632.10] masticating cold pressed juicer that
[3629.76 - 3634.86] actually squeezes so hard to get the
[3632.10 - 3636.18] juice out and you save money because the
[3634.86 - 3637.80] other juicer companies much think it
[3636.18 - 3639.60] must think everybody's just Rich the
[3637.80 - 3642.78] price of food going up who cares just
[3639.60 - 3644.70] buy more produce buy more produce
[3642.78 - 3647.40] okay
[3644.70 - 3649.14] I mean think about that it's insane and
[3647.40 - 3651.54] that's why I've endorsed these guys all
[3649.14 - 3653.28] right half cup of fresh or frozen mango

[3662.52 - 3667.56] shifter shot
[3665.04 - 3669.42] is just such an incredible shot I don't
[3667.56 - 3672.24] even know what to say
[3669.42 - 3674.28] it just is
[3672.24 - 3675.42] let's move on to the next piece right

[3720.84 - 3723.56] you guys don't mind
[3725.16 - 3730.26] so
[3726.24 - 3732.30] half cup of chopped raw zucchini
[3730.26 - 3734.82] I'm just gonna peel some of my skin off
[3732.30 - 3738.02] you don't have to peel the skin off I
[3734.82 - 3738.02] like to peel the skin off
[3744.24 - 3747.24] foreign
[3749.42 - 3753.20] get some of this in here
[3754.80 - 3758.36] we're gonna do about a half cup
[3760.62 - 3764.42] a little bit more to go
[3777.60 - 3781.22] thing is about the dream shifter
[3781.98 - 3787.20] you feel it as the day goes on if you
[3785.04 - 3789.48] take it in the morning I get an instant

[3806.82 - 3812.16] so then the last is some a quarter cup
[3810.00 - 3814.88] of loosely packed
[3812.16 - 3814.88] mint
[3815.34 - 3819.24] so peppermint leaves
[3817.98 - 3821.22] now
[3819.24 - 3823.70] that's the one to use is the peppermint
[3821.22 - 3823.70] leaves
[3823.82 - 3827.03] [Applause]
[3830.88 - 3833.96] so a quarter cup
[3836.34 - 3840.36] so I'm going to need some more mint now
[3837.96 - 3844.52] the thing is is if you're not a fan of
[3840.36 - 3844.52] mint just kind of hold your nose

[4126.56 - 4131.12] pressed masticating juicer it is
[4128.84 - 4133.82] literally like this incredible Chef out
[4131.12 - 4135.14] of a unit like I can't even tell you and
[4133.82 - 4137.06] it's mind-blowing so I'm just letting
[4135.14 - 4139.70] you know about why I love the 1500 for
[4137.06 - 4142.22] those reasons it's incredible
[4139.70 - 4143.90] anyway you guys know I've endorsed this
[4142.22 - 4145.58] this brand because of this because of
[4143.90 - 4147.86] what they do and because it saves you
[4145.58 - 4149.00] money and the other juicer companies for
[4147.86 - 4150.80] some reason like I said they think
[4149.00 - 4152.18] everybody's rich and doesn't have to
[4150.80 - 4153.38] worry about everybody's so rich they
[4152.18 - 4154.70] don't have to worry about food costs
[4153.38 - 4156.68] Rising
[4154.70 - 4158.66] so they're they're you know they're
[4156.68 - 4160.28] giving everybody Flash and pop with
[4158.66 - 4162.26] their juicers the spinning thing and all
[4160.28 - 4164.84] that stuff but they don't realize this
[4162.26 - 4166.88] is a cold pressed masticating juicer
[4164.84 - 4169.28] that actually saves you money because
[4166.88 - 4170.84] it's squeezing more juice out because
[4169.28 - 4173.12] everybody isn't rich
[4170.84 - 4175.22] I mean the audacity and nerve of the
[4173.12 - 4176.12] other user companies guys what did you
