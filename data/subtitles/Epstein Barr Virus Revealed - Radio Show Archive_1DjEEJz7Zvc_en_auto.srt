76
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,680
important

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,560
um so let's get started um you can see

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm you know I'm trying to get through

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,720
things that the you know at the

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,799
beginning is quick as I can almost

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,000
because I want to make sure we get

82
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,280
everything we can out of this show and

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,360
this is so important

84
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,879
um let's take a look here and see what's

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,400
happening what you're going to hear

86
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:29,760
today about Epstein bar it could be even

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,840
shocking and it could be more than just

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,799
shocking in this sense because it could

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,040
be it's real it's revelational it is you

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,519
know it can really wake up the mind and

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,200
wake up the body unlike other because if

92
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,720
you're dealing with symptoms and you're

93
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,599
dealing with illness and you're dealing

94
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,080
with conditions and you're not getting

95
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,720
answers and you got fatigue and all

96
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,040
these different things hearing the truth

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,560
about what's going on could be pretty

98
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,280
heavy and so with that I want you to

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,400
just relax get a cup of tea get a cup of

100
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,799
herbal tea of course

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,599
and relax and listen to the show you

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,280
know if you got a notepad or whatever

103
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,400
take notes but what what I recommend is

104
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,000
going back to the show in the archives

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
because we're going to cover a lot of

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,799
information I'm going to drop a lot of

107
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,639
information down on everybody and so you

108
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,280
might want to go back to this archive

109
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,000
for sure and because we're going to run

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,560
over a lot of things you may miss

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,560
something and and you want to get every

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
bit of it it's that important so I'm

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,800
preparing you

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,360
um so when it comes down to Healing

115
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,400
especially healing with Epstein bar

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,320
knowing the truth knowing the cause is

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,400
half the battle to Healing it's why

118
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,440
people don't heal so easily it's why so

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,720
many people have chronic illness and

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,720
don't have answers and basically what

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,840
happens

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,720
is that if we don't have answers if we

123
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,479
don't know what's going on how is the

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,759
healing going to start start see that's

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,919
half the battle that's half of how it

126
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,560
happens the other half is knowing what

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,560
to do having answers on what to do what

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,880
to address how to address for example

129
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,720
Epstein bar and we're going to cover

130
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,440
that so it's about knowing what's wrong

131
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,600
that's half the battle knowing what to

132
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,800
do to fix it to heal to move forward

133
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,840
this is a big part of it all and that's

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,440
why also why we're doing the show so to

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,680
understand EP steam bar virus we have to

136
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,919
hop into our time machine and set it for

137
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,639
1890 yeah I I said it 1890 that's what

138
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,520
year we're going to so let's let's get

139
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,080
ready and you know put the seat bels on

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,600
for this at this time in history a

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,880
harmless virus that was herpetic in

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,400
nature so herpetic meaning like herpes

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,160
herpetic in nature was redefining itself

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,280
due to antibiotic experimentation

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
this is antibiotic use before 1928 did

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,639
you hear about the 1928 thing where

147
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,280
penicillin was born that's when it was

148
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,440
discovered and it was a huge Discovery

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,000
penicillin it saved a lot of lives it

150
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,599
was definitely an amazing it's an

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,039
amazing Discovery in health history till

152
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:25,280
today and so but right prior that there

153
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,400
was also other types of antibiotics

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
being used yes you won't see that on the

155
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
internet you can look you may not find

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,240
that different forms of

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,960
antibiotics and this is the earlier

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,440
Renditions of penicillin being used to

159
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
treat various

160
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,319
bacteria this was an amazing Discovery

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,720
like I said before and it's helped so

162
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,960
many other people but at the same time

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,919
this harmless common herpetic natured

164
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,120
virus which we named later epsteen bar

165
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,919
was developing an intelligence and

166
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,440
learning how to cope and maneuver around

167
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,800
pre-

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,440
antibiotics pre-time

169
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,560
antibiotics and it began to use this

170
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,680
early source of antibiotics as a food

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,919
source now this wouldn't have been a big

172
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,520
concern really or a big deal if there

173
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,960
wasn't another Factor contributing

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,240
another Factor occurring at the same

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:29,360
time in the same era back in the late

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,160
1800s and this was early pesticide

177
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,039
herbicide and fungicide use and

178
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,479
development and you may say you may be

179
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,759
someone that knows about pesticides and

180
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,639
say well Anthony that's not true because

181
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,680
pesticides really started in the late

182
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,879
30s and you know during the War Machine

183
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,360
during you know that World War II where

184
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,199
all the chemicals were made and all the

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,680
pesticides were made and the

186
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,240
DDT but there were pesticides before

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,520
this time period before this time period

188
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
and they were being developed in the

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,840
late 1800s early 19 1900s they were made

190
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,639
up of Arsenic and Lead what they were

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,319
were arsenic sprays arsenic water

192
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,639
arsenic spray Arsenic and Lead Vapor

193
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,360
okay and this was fairly a fairly new

194
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,199
exposure in our day and AG to us and our

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,800
immune systems and it was on our food

196
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,800
supply everywhere so you know how you go

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
and get organic food cuz you don't want

198
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
the pesticides today all the synthetic

199
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
pesticides and everything well back then

200
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,919
back before in the 1890s and right

201
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,320
around 1900 there were sprays on

202
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,240
everybody's food and nobody really even

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,959
knew anything but the difference between

204
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,560
organic or conventional because

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,519
synthetic sprays weren't even invented

206
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,240
yet to differentiate that this is

207
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,720
serious this is something to understand

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,120
here it's important factor what we're

209
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,040
going through what we're talking about

210
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,000
so instead there was these arsenic

211
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,800
sprays and it was on everything it was

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,079
laced down all this food and everyone

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
had a big container a big container of

214
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,160
it at home with a hand pump you know

215
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,040
those antique you know bug killer pumps

216
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,279
on and it would spray a vapor of Arsenic

217
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,440
and Lead misted okay all of your plants

218
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,240
all your garden plants all the fields

219
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,920
that were you growing produce had this

220
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,120
stuff the stuff was also being you know

221
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,240
sprayed in all kinds of different ways

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,880
this common herpetic virus we call

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,120
Epstein bar now this common docile

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,040
easygoing virus learned how to use toxic

225
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
heavy metals such as Arsenic and Lead as

226
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,920
its

227
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,399
fuel it became fuel for this virus

228
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,480
basically the Industrial

229
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:48,640
Revolution was fueling and creating

230
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,360
Epstein bar virus the Redevelopment of

231
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Epstein bar virus what I'm trying to say

232
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,279
is Epstein bar was beginning to redefine

233
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,720
itself and mutate by thriving on these

234
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,320
toxic heavy metals including early

235
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,079
antibiotics that were even pre-1 1928

236
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,480
the penicillin age which also had heavy

237
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,880
metals in them to begin

238
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,120
with and that's how things were

239
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,240
established so so we have to know this

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,800
so by

241
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,480
1900 Epstein bar had established itself

242
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,360
and had a hunger for arsenic lead and

243
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,680
some Mercury and at this time our food

244
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,720
supply was covered like I said in early

245
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,279
PES side use of this compromised with

246
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,639
all this comprised of all this Arsenic

247
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,279
and Lead so when we would eat our food

248
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,120
the Arsenic and Lead would quickly

249
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,320
absorb get ready get ready for this it

250
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,839
would quickly absorb into our

251
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,959
thyroids into our thyroids so as you

252
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,760
would eat this food that was everything

253
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,600
was laced in Arsenic at this time period

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,839
understand this this is serious stuff

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,880
when it would enter your mouth the

256
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,920
Arsenic would absorb into your cells of

257
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,079
your mouth and travel so when you

258
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,320
swallowing it would absorb right into

259
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:11,639
your throat as you were swallowing and

260
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,440
it would then absorb into your thyroid

261
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,480
and your thyroid will fill up with

262
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Arsenic and lead and even some

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,839
Mercury the Epstein bar virus would

264
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,880
adapt and start to search for its food

265
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,240
and travel when I mean be food Epstein

266
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,240
bar would feed off of Arsenic and

267
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,200
remember that it would travel and start

268
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,040
to adapt and learn how to adapt in the

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
body and it started mutating back in

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,839
that day it would travel for that

271
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,600
Arsenic and that lead and guess where it

272
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
would find its way guess where it would

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,240
go to are you guessing what I'm thinking

274
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,120
you are the

275
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,880
thyroid and invading the thyroid causing

276
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,360
you know what I'm talking about

277
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,160
Hashimoto's

278
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,040
thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis now

279
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,519
this label this condition of Hashimoto

280
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,000
thyroiditis was discovered meaning the

281
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,959
label was dis was created in

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,880
1912 1912 see no one knew what caused

283
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,160
Hashimoto thyroiditis they still don't

284
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,279
know today I've spent decades trying to

285
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,519
teach people that it's caused by epeen

286
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,839
bar virus and it's just starting to

287
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,440
surface now out there and any place you

288
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,480
hear it or see it it originally sources

289
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,480
from me I'm just being straightforward

290
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,600
about that one that's the bottom line

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,920
cuz I'm the one that only knew that

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,880
because of spirit for decades now and

293
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,279
been trying to get that information out

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,079
there so now when Epstein bar virus when

295
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,639
the Epstein bar gets into the thyroid

296
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,920
this is stage three of Epstein bar so

297
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,000
you have to understand this this is

298
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,880
stage three of Epstein bar so that means

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,720
when it entered into somebody's thyroid

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,279
in

301
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,839
1912 in the early

302
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,760
1900s this was stage three of having

303
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,959
Epstein bar now we're going to talk

304
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,079
about Epstein bar stages Epstein bar has

305
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
four

306
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,600
stages stage one of Epstein bar is when

307
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,440
the virus is in the body but it's in a

308
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,680
dormancy incubation period it's

309
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,160
incubating it's waiting for an

310
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,959
opportunity like when we get really run

311
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,519
down or we get deficient or we got

312
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,040
stressed out or we're

313
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,760
intoxicated with some kind of poisons or

314
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
whatever it may be or we have emotional

315
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,600
hardships

316
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,839
and then boom romatic fever occurs yes

317
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,399
romatic fever guess what romatic fever

318
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,720
is no one realizes it's in the medical

319
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,360
industry romatic fever is Epstein bar

320
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,360
it's

321
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,320
mononucleosis it's a variety of

322
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,800
mononucleosis and now it's diagnosis

323
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,120
mononucleosis used to be diagnosis

324
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,440
romatic fever and it's also diagnosed as

325
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,440
glandular fever in fact all the way back

326
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,480
back in those days when Epstein bar

327
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,880
would hit stage two and turn into

328
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,839
mononucleosis it was called glandular

329
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,320
fever it's still called glandular fever

330
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,000
in different parts of the

331
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,880
world the infamous kissing disease were

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,720
taught about is called glandular fever

333
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:27,440
romatic you know romatic fever and

334
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,240
mononucleosis and so this is important

335
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,079
to know the virus

336
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,440
um once again after that period goes and

337
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,519
waits into a dorcy period this could

338
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,959
take a month this could take years this

339
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,360
could take decades depending on what's

340
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,240
going on in the

341
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,480
person and it's and this happens before

342
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,720
it goes to stage three remember I told

343
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,079
you I jumped ahead earlier because I had

344
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,839
to because 1912 they discovered

345
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,160
thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis is

346
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,959
stage three so when the virus comes out

347
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,240
of dorcy again which could take a month

348
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,240
or a year or a decade or more or two

349
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
decades or even longer it can turn into

350
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,920
hashimotos thyroiditis or

351
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,720
hypothyroidism and it depends on so many

352
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,079
variables the person's immune system

353
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,680
what is happening in their lives I've

354
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,160
seen children get mono at age five or

355
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,000
six or seven years old and then they get

356
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,680
Hashim Modas at 16 years of age 17 years

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,800
of age or 18 years of age it kashimoto

358
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,720
that early that means they had Mono

359
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,440
before that this is not understood on

360
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,319
any level in our medical field right now

361
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,880
so what you're hearing is groundbreaking

362
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,560
information that doesn't exist out

363
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,800
there but back in the old days in the

364
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,399
early 1900s we going back now it

365
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,440
normally took longer before there were

366
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,199
only because there were only a few

367
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,600
varieties of Epstein bar what I mean is

368
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,920
it took longer for Hashimoto thought

369
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,160
thyroiditis it took longer for the next

370
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,199
phase or the next stage of Epstein bar

371
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,160
because there were only a few varieties

372
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,839
of epin bar in that time which leads me

373
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,560
to the next bit of information to

374
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,000
understand is there are over 60

375
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,639
varieties of Epstein bar today our

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,839
medical model has no clue about this

377
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,600
some are doile some are timid so some

378
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,560
varieties of Epstein bar doile some

379
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,240
varieties of Epstein bar are timid and

380
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,319
some are more

381
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,399
aggressive so going back to the old days

382
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:41,199
early to mid 1900s it took most people

383
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,920
especially women to get to the age of 40

384
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:47,639
get to the age of 45 get to the age of

385
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,319
50 before they experienced a set of

386
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,199
symptoms that eluded the medical world

387
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,759
even up to

388
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,000
today understand the importance of this

389
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,199
this is this is amazing if you got

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,319
Epstein bar and you were born around the

391
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:08,160
time of 1900 or 1890 or 1895 or

392
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,079
1903 and right around the age

393
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,079
40 the virus would go into the next set

394
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,959
of phases right around 40 45 50 years

395
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
old every person was different because

396
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,000
of different circumstances and different

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
situations but at that time there

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,120
weren't a lot of varieties of Epstein

399
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,600
bar so they were all similar there only

400
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,559
were a few at that time that mutated at

401
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:35,120
that early time so there was a whole

402
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,720
like crowd a whole vast sea of women

403
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,600
that experienced epine bar symptoms out

404
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,120
of

405
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,799
nowhere turn on the turn of around 1950

406
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,200
right around 1945 to

407
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:51,280
1950 and it stormed the medical world

408
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,320
these symptoms that all the women were

409
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,240
faced with and these might be familiar

410
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,600
okay so you know match them up TI yours

411
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,280
if you want to that's you know it's

412
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,640
important to know this is important but

413
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,400
the symptoms were the next phase of

414
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,840
epine bar which is called stage four

415
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,039
Epstein bar that's what this is so that

416
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
that's what all these symptoms were

417
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,080
about to go into it's stage four Epstein

418
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,120
bar so it took a long time for these few

419
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,039
varieties of Epstein bar for women to

420
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,159
get you know that were born at 1900 or

421
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,440
like I said 1895 and by the time they

422
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,400
turned 40 45 50 years old they had

423
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
tingles and numbness do you know about

424
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,000
the tingles and numbness

425
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,480
they had aches and pains joint

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,720

round of stage four Epstein bar symptoms

455
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,080
ever in

456
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,240
history ever in history and no one's

457
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,240
talking about it no one's talking about

458
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,720
about it but right here at this show and

information around because it's so

465
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,760
critical to

466
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,360
know and women were told at that in this

467
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,640
time period that it was all in their

468
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,679
heads and they were told they were crazy

469
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,840
this was the moment in time right around

470
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,400
the 1945 1950 period when this wave of

471
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,280
symptoms from Epstein bar crashed the

472
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,000
scene women were told by every single

473
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,559
Medical Institution there was that they

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
were lazy that their fatigue was because

475
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,440
they were lazy because they were bored

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,400
because they were crazy they even

477
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,640
entered it into some medical medical

478
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,880
books where they called it crazy women's

479
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,440
syndrome that's how they dealt with it

480
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,400
and that lasted that's still kind of

481
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,880
floating around a little bit it's it's

482
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,799
died out cuz we put labels now on sets

483
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,440
of symptoms so the so before these

484
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,520
labels all these new labels came about

485
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,440
before that started happening in the in

486
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,240
the 19 late 1980s yes in the late 1980s

487
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,919
it took that long in the 1990s before we

488
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,279
started getting actually names for these

489
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,400
conditions you were just insane that's

490
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,600
what happened when you had all the

491
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,360
symptoms I mentioned when you were

492
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,559
fatigued had tingles and numbness

493
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,760
vertigo dizziness ringing in the ears

494
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,039
hot flashes heart potations brain fog

495
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,279
depression anxiety burning in various

496
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,000
parts of the body blurry eyes migraines

497
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,760
aches and pain swelling these are all

498
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,320
stage four symptoms of Epstein bar and

499
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:44,080
we were told we were insane at that time

500
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,279
period okay the the push back occurred

501
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,320
women had enough at that point hitting

502
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,320
in the mid-50s after five to seven years

503
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,080
to the late 50s women had enough and the

504
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,240
push back was just

505
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,919
enormous and basically what happened

506
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
after that these symptoms of the medical

507
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,440
field that they all the symptoms that

508
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
women were experiencing the medical

509
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,679
field put a big blame on one thing you

510
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,360
know what I'm talking about someone out

511
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,919
there knows what I'm talking about that

512
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,600
was the birth of the hormone movement

513
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,679
that was when it was all hormonal it's

514
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,240
actually hormones and they were still

515
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,840
saying you're still crazy to have these

516
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,039
symptoms because there's nothing wrong

517
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,520
with you know everybody they were

518
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,120
looking at so when they were doing you

519
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,200
know physical exams they're like who

520
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,760
nothing wrong with you we don't know why

521
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,440
you have tingles and numbness so you're

522
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,440
either crazy or it's hormonal we still

523
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,320
get that today where we're told it's

524
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,880
hormonal now to and that's what's

525
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,720
happening and so hormones the hormone

526
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,360
movement their hormone replacement era

527
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
was born in the late 50s because of

528
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,000
stage four Epstein

529
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,039
bar women didn't suffer from the

530
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,400
symptoms ever before in the past ever

531
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,919
anytime they hit menopause ever in

532
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,120
history were they suffering from these

533
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,480
symptoms it wasn't n it was never there

534
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,679
because it was never was never hormonal

535
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,440
see it was abstein bar stage four now

536
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:17,159
decades later women of all ages get the

537
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,320
symptoms get all the symptoms I just

538
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,760
mentioned so when they're younger

539
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,960
they're not told it's

540
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,720
hormones they but they're starting to

541
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,360
now because still to this day people

542
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,080
don't know why we're getting these

543
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,679
symptomss so they're still kind of

544
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,000
saying well now you're 30 years old

545
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,760
maybe you have hormonal problems and

546
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,039
maybe that's creating all these symptoms

547
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,640
of fatigue all these symptoms of brain

548
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,679
fog blurry eyes you know everything uh

549
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,240
heart palpitations tingles and numbness

550
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,440
so even younger women and men some men

551
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,400
are being told it's it's a hormone

552
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,360
problem and if that's not good enough

553
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,919
then it's off to the Lyme disease doctor

554
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,520
you can listen to my lyme disease show

555
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,520
if you want a little taste of the whole

556
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,000
lime

557
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,799
truth and so that's what's happening to

558
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,240
today now we'll go back a little bit now

559
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,080
now now back by

560
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,240
1964 two brilliant biologists discovered

561
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,320
a virus that was responsible for

562
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,840
mononucleosis romatic fever but

563
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,159
mononucleosis glandular fever and they

564
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,960
singled it out and named it Epstein bar

565
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,720
virus after the doctors and that was an

566
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,600
amazing Discovery it really was and that

567
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,720
goes to show you what we can do with the

568
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,480
doctors that are out there the problem

569
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,559
is the funding dropped and that was the

570
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,880
bottom line funding was over it's a dead

571
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,679
topic see you later and that's what

572
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,480
happens in chronic illness though that's

573
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,159
the whole point that's what happens all

574
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,480
the time now what medical research and

575
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,440
science has done to acknowledge Epstein

576
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
bar symptoms meaning without knowing

577
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Epstein bar causes any of these symptoms

578
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,360
is they put labels now on these sets of

579
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
symptoms so the medical world doesn't

580
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,960
realize that this is Epstein bar related

581
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,399
but they put names on sets of symptoms

582
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,480
now that everybody has and that's

583
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,600
fibromyalgia what what causes it h

584
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,919
nobody

585
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,360
knows but it's Epstein bar that's stage

586
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,840
four Epstein bar multiple sceris still

587
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,200
don't know the cause it's a mystery

588
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,600
illness Epstein bar different varieties

589
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,279
of Epstein bar cause cause and mass now

590
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,600
there's over 60 varieties like I said

591
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:29,440
chronic fatigue syndrome which has

592
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:32,480
various names now such as and me CFS

593
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,720
okay also systemic exertion intolerance

594
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,600
disease these are still just a way of

595
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,080
saying yes you're tiredness is real so

596
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,840
thank God we have labels at least to say

597
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,520
hey your symptoms are real but we're

598
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,399
nowhere closer to understanding what's

599
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,520
causing this and knowing that it's over

600
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,159
60 varieties of epsteam bar causing

601
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,679
these sets of these labels these sets of

602
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,600
symptoms

603
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,240
so and it goes on past then ra RTI

604
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,240
arthritis that's another one so you know

605
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,120
when children get ra it's stage 4 fste

606
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,000
bar but early

607
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,440
on early on in their lives because

608
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,919
there's different varieties they've

609
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,000
mutated and they become a little bit

610
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,200
more aggressive and kids get different

611
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,200
stages early on doesn't mean everybody

612
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,360
can't heal anyone can heal and there's

613
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,679
ways of doing about it we're going to

614
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,799
get to that don't worry we're going to

615
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:30,080
get to that menopause that's a label see

616
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,960
menopause really is just supposed to be

617
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,360
menstration stopping the cycle stopping

618
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,919
that's all it's supposed to be in fact

619
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,279
before 1950 women felt great after their

620
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,640
cycle stopped they felt great it was

621
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,559
looked forward to in history meaning in

622
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,279
P in the past women look forward to that

623
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,799
stopping it meant they felt better more

624
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,799
energy than ever before no symptoms

625
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,480
would

626
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:57,080
occur and but now we label your set of

627
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,200
symptoms everybody sets of symptoms as

628
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,600
menopause

629
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,320
depression we use that label too when

630
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,039
we're depressed instead of knowing the

631
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,200
root cause of someone's depression we

632
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:12,600
throw label anxiety lupus that's caused

633
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,440
by Epstein bar and that's another one

634
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,360
and of course many cases of Lyme disease

635
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,360
these labeled conditions plus many more

636
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,080
are caused by over 60 varieties of

637
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,880
Epstein bar and in different stages of

638
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,240
the virus including Hashimoto

639
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,640
thyroiditis like we talked about before

640
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:34,679
he hepatitus C is not a hepatitis virus

641
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,799
it's a condition of the liver caused by

642
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,080
a variety of Epstein bar there they

643
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,480
still don't know this and medical

644
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,360
history Medical Research Medical Science

645
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,799
isn't even caught up to that you know I

646
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,600
always say I'm going to die come back in

647
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,679
another lifetime they're still not going

648
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
to know die One More Time come back in

649
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,399
another lifetime and it's possible they

650
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,120
still won't know you know and it's it's

651
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,200
nobody's fault it's nobody's fault but

652
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,760
that's the slowness of it all that's the

653
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,159
slowness of of everything so hepatitis C

654
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,360
is caused by Epstein bar that's

655
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,320
different than Hepatitis B hepatitis C

656
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,440
is is Epstein bar

657
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,559
glaucoma you know the eye illness the

658
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,640
eye condition glaucoma that's caused by

659
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,840
a variety of epine bar and certain

660
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
cancer specifically breast cancer is

661
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,960
caused by ep bar

662
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,399
viruses so all this is important to know

663
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,320
this is part of the epid mic we live in

664
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,039
today now it it does matter to know this

665
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,519
information it's not because you know

666
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,880
knowing it makes things more scary

667
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,279
that's not it at all you gain control

668
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,480
knowing the truth you don't want the

669
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,440
truth avoided or you don't want it

670
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,320
hidden away you don't want it being a

671
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,640
mystery because that's when all this

672
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,840
stuff is tougher on us is when it's a

673
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,039
mystery and nobody knows and we're never

674
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,919
getting validation and we're going to Dr

675
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,840
doctor you get 50 doctors going to

676
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,480
different people and you're traveling

677
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,360
across country you're spending hundreds

678
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,480
of thousands of dollars that's more

679
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,559
damaging than knowing the truth and

680
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,360
knowing how to recover and heal you see

681
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,440
that's that's how it

682
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,120
works see you don't have to there's a

683
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,080
couple of things to know you don't have

684
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,360
to remember having mono in order to have

685
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,760
Epstein bar in the system some people

686
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,720
have bad cases of mononucleosis so they

687
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,240
remember it specifically but some people

688
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,519
have had a sore throat and a scratchy

689
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,000
throat for a week and that's all they

690
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,440
had and it went away it went into a

691
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,360
dormancy so let talk about Epstein bar

692
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,960
testing when you go to the doctor and

693
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,279
you get tested for Epstein bar they only

694
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,960
care about present infection which is

695
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,960
mononucleosis they only care about

696
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,640
present

697
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,240
infection now what the medical research

698
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,760
and medical science and doctors don't

699
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,720
know right now is that past infection

700
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,519
Epstein bar meaning knowing that you had

701
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,399
it in the past still means it could be

702
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,880
doing something and creating your

703
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,600
symptoms so it's completely ignored so

704
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,480
when you go to the doctor and you say I

705
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,919
got this problem and I got this and I

706
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,039
you know I got tingles and I got

707
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,720
twitches and I got all these you know

708
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,559
different things going on and I got um

709
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,799
you know and I got fatigue and I can't

710
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,360
function and they do a test and they say

711
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,840
everything looks okay it looks like you

712
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,559
had Epstein bar but that shouldn't be

713
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,000
your problem because you don't have it

714
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,120
now that's not true they haven't

715
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,399
developed the proper testing to see that

716
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,600
it's in the organs and then it's also

717
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,320
affecting the nervous system they don't

718
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,919
have this technology yet we still don't

719
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,679
have a lot of technology in chronic

720
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,799
illness how do I know that there's 200

721
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,880
million sick people in the US alone with

722
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,480
symptoms that are mystery illness that's

723
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,480
how I know that we don't have the

724
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,480
technology or the understanding yet you

725
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,519
know this is you know I'm passionate

726
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,279
about this because this is about

727
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,279
everything about you getting better it

728
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,200
means the world so when you have stage

729
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:59,279
four Epstein bar and all the symptoms

730
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,399
around it the doctor can't find Epstein

731
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,320
bar actively in the bloodstream so they

732
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,919
dismiss it it's one of the mistakes this

733
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,120
is one of the greatest medical blunders

734
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,279
of our

735
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,960
time we'll talk about some of the

736
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,240
symptoms of Epstein bar Epstein bar is

737
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,080
herpetic so it's in the herpes family

738
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,000
this is the one family the only family

739
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,679
of bugs that release a

740
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,039
neurotoxin that aggravates the nervous

741
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,240
system causing tingles and numbness see

742
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,600
the neurotoxin is basically an excrement

743
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,679
that comes out of the virus after the

744
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,360
virus feeds off of heavy metals feeds

745
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,240
off of foods like eggs like I talk about

746
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,000
if you're if you're someone who's not

747
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,399
feeling good and you got all kinds of

748
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,399
different symptoms make sure you're not

749
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,720
eating eggs because eggs will feed a bug

750
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:50,440
like Epstein

751
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,799
bar so this neurotoxin can create a lot

752
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,399
of different symptoms can create tingles

753
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,880
and numbness and many other different

754
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,360
symptoms around that brain fog can

755
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,039
create um aches and pains and so this

756
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,279
neurotoxin also creates food allergies

757
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,960
people say well how can I have a food

758
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,000
allergy now how could that have happened

759
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,320
I never had it before why am I

760
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,760
developing food allergy I went to the

761
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,679
doctor to the you know the integrative

762
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,320
doctor I went to the functional medicine

763
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,360
doctor I got all these food allergies

764
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,240
and sensitivities now that's from having

765
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,960
a higher debris of this byproduct these

766
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,120
neurotoxins from Epstein bar it creates

767
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,519
chemical sensitivity

768
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,799
it creates food at food sensitivities

769
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,960
epine bar creates a lot of byproduct and

770
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,440
debris and garbage and this builds up in

771
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,080
the liver causes a stagnant sluggish

772
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,120
liver and gets the heart to even have a

773
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,039
heart palpitation because all that

774
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,399
byproduct from the liver goes up to the

775
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,000
heart and trips up the mitro valve

776
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,480
creating heart palpitations these These

777
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,360
are the mystery H heart palps that no

778
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,080
one understands out there and it's the

779
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,480
sticky residue that builds up in the

780
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,760
mitro valve this is from the byproduct

781
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,559
EBV Epstein bar raises inflammation

782
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,760
markers with this byproduct it produces

783
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,600
it raises inflammation markers causing

784
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,480
the CRP so when you get the CRP C

785
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,960
reactive protein test and it's showing

786
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,960
that you you got an elevation no one

787
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,600
realizes it it's from byproduct from

788
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,399
Epstein bar same thing with the

789
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,279
anti-nuclear antigen test the Ana test

790
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,559
this is inflammation

791
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,320
levels that rise

792
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,200
because of toxins released in

793
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,799
neurotoxins and byproduct from Epstein

794
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,840
bar so guess what you end up getting a

795
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:39,639
lupus diagnosis that's how far off we

796
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,440
are we're that far off in

797
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:45,159
medicine we're that far off so we get

798
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,840
the whole lupus thing and and that's

799
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,799
because someone's getting sensitive and

800
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,960
they're getting the chemical

801
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,000
sensitivities and they're getting all

802
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,440
the symptoms based around it this

803
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,760
byproduct raises homocysteine levels

804
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,760
were you told you have an MTHFR gene

805
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,279
mutation at all so when you go to the

806
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
practitioner and you're told you know

807
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,360
you're having that gene mutation some

808
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,440
people have three mutations some people

809
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,799
have you know four mutations two M

810
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,159
mutations right so when you that's

811
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,000
because of epine bar byproduct it's from

812
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,639
having Epstein bar in the system for a

813
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,440
long time in your life and it builds up

814
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,800
a tremendous amount of byproduct and

815
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,639
excrement releases all these toxins

816
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,879
including neurotoxins so it raises

817
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:28,960
homine levels and it sets off the faulty

818
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:31,800
MTHFR gene mutation

819
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,000
test and creates a but it does create a

820
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,520
true methylation issue at the same time

821
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,159
so there is a methylation issue that

822
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,639
that does occur from having Epstein bar

823
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,800
so there's like they're almost there

824
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,679
with that one Epstein bar can make a

825
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,879
liver really sluggish causing weak

826
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:51,639
digestion and breaking down hydrochloric

827
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:54,919
acid and Epstein bar can can trigger off

828
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,359
false positives on a lime test that's

829
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,359
when your lime test comes back

830
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:02,160
borderline why is it borderline you

831
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,040
either have lime or you don't you can go

832
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
you can listen to the lime show on that

833
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,440
for sure cuz I can't go into lime like

834
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,680
crazy into lime right now and deep into

835
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,240
it but it can trigger off your lime

836
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,960
tighters for everything it could

837
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,920
literally mask as bartella babesia

838
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,119
bellia that's what Epstein has the power

839
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,200
to do not in everybody depending on how

840
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,599
long you've had it what variety you have

841
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
so it's important to understand these

842
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,079
things and and anyone listening to this

843
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,160
I'm not saying Bella doesn't exist I'm

844
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,320
not saying lime you know bacteria such

845
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,520
as B you know bellia you know babesia

846
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,160
parasite babesia doesn't exist I'm not

847
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,200
saying that so you you know don't get

848
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,839
thrown by this right now if you if this

849
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,160
the first time hearing one of my shows

850
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,119
but evv upsteam bar is responsible for

851
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,880
hundreds of thousands of people's

852
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,680
tonsils coming out you know the whole

853
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,000
tonsil thing when they're plucking them

854
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,200
like apples forever back in the ' 50s

855
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,240
and the' 60s the 70s and we're still

856
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,040
plucking them out that's from mono

857
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,000
undiagnosed mono because mono is elusive

858
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,280
you can have mononucleosis Epstein bar

859
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,280
is elusive you can have it once early on

860
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,280
in your childhood they won't rediagnosis

861
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,520
it's another thing it does so they're

862
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,160
just pulling tonsils out for decades

863
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,680
without realizing what's creating

864
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,040
tonsilitis see how important the show is

865
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,560
this episode I mean it's really that

866
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,440
important

867
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,520
and you know fste bar tends to create

868
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,880
problems with soreness aches and pains

869
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,119
fatigue after the body gets jolted so I

870
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,760
you know lots of people they get into

871
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,400
small car accidents or they have a they

872
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,960
have some trauma and they and and their

873
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,400
body is physically fine after or they

874
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,839
recover from the trauma part but yet

875
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,400
they have new aches and pains that are

876
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,000
unexplainable by doctors and in by

877
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,680
medical research and Science and you

878
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,440
start getting fibromyalgia and you start

879
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,760
getting inflamed this is from Epstein

880
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,880
bar ttis ringing in the ears is caused

881
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,079
by the Labyrinth of the inside of the

882
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,119
ear getting inflamed by epine bars

883
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,280
neurotoxins you go to an ear nose and

884
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,560
throat doctor they're not going to

885
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,800
figure that one out that's going to take

886
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,280
30 years from now it's caused by a

887
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,680
neurotoxin That's What Causes That

888
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,359
ringing in the air unless you damage

889
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,440
your nerve your nerve in the ear by

890
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,880
listening to you know concerts rock

891
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,680
concerts your whole life or something

892
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,160
crazy like that you worked in a machine

893
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,240
shop or something and that's a little

894
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,119
different but this is this is the common

895
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,520
ringing in the ears caused by Epstein

896
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,280
bar I was saying previously dizziness

897
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,760
vertigo that's the Vagas nerve that runs

898
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,520
through the chest that makes the chest

899
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,760
feel tight that Vagas nerve gets

900
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,960
inflamed by neurotoxins from Epstein bar

901
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,680
causing vertigo bouts of vertigo bed

902
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,119
spins head head spins dizziness balance

903
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,560
issues that are unexplainable by the

904
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,280
medical world when you go to the doctor

905
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,280
this is caused by Epstein Barb then

906
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,640
there's headaches back of the head neck

907
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,200
AES back of the neck caused by frenic

908
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,079
nerves frenic nerves that run up through

909
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,480
the chest up through the neck they get

910
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,400
inflamed from the neurotoxin Epstein

911
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,440
bar epin bar has a friend in crime

912
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,400
called strep acacus it's a bacteria

913
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,440
strep that's when you get strep throat

914
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,079
that that's when you have strep that's

915
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,319
when women are about to have a baby so

916
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,440
the doctor checks for vaginal strep the

917
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:40,200
strep is everywhere in our bodies it's a

918
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,079
co-actor to Epstein bar causes a lot of

919
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,280
the bladder problems strep aacle is

920
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:49,000
responsible for intercal cystitis which

921
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:52,319
is technically kind of caused by Epstein

922
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,160
bar because it's its co-actor so that

923
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,119
that alone has to be uncovered someday

924
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,640
and you're only going to hear it here

925
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,720
at this show at the medical Medium

926
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,240
show so and that could lead to you know

927
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,599
bladder leaking burning without a proper

928
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,599
diagnosis and and many other kinds of

929
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,240
things bladder spasms so basically the

930
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,560
bottom line is we're going to get

931
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,160
through the show today we're I know I'm

932
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,880
going a little fast that's why you have

933
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,720
to you have to go to the archives on

934

this but you have to listen to the show

935
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,000
again look a big part of all of this is

936
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,040

control over it in healing and moving

939
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,760
forward it's about knocking the viral

940
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:42,160
load slowly down and restoring your

941
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,440
nervous system restoring your health

942
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,680

944
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,839
what it's

945
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,520
about if you had symptoms for years in

946
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:55,480
your life it may take a little while you

947
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,760
got to be patient it's three steps up

948
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,000
two steps back three steps up two steps

949
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,720
back that's how it is you start feeling

950
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,720
better a month later and you start

951
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,440
feeling a little better better another

952
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,680
month later and you keep on climbing

953
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,640
that ladder and climbing that ladder

954
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,240
until you look back a year or whatever

955
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,880
it is depending on how long you've been

956
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,000
sick with all these different symptoms

957
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,079
you look back and you see how much

958
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,760
better you are I've watched a lot of

959
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,839
people get their lives back I've helped

970
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,119

Epstein bar toxins out that you know but

978
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,359
how many people eat eat enough asparagus

979
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,560
spinach helps remove Epstein bar how

980
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,839
does it do that it cleanses out the

981
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,440
Epstein bar toxins the overload of

982
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:22,680
Epstein bar toxins cleanses the colon

983
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,160
too apricots another great one for

984
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,640
rebuilding the nervous system cilantro

985
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,800
removes heavy m

986
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,240
which feed Epstein bar so you want

987
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,400
cilantro in all the time you have to

988
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,960
remember hey look if if it's been a week

989
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,200
since you've had cilantro that's not

990
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,119
going to help that's not going to help

991
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,880
so you have to know that this you have

992
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,200
to at least do some of these things you

993
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,920
know you don't have to do all of them

994
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,400
it's life is overwhelming there's a lot

995
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,920
going on you just get some of them in

996
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,720
cilantro is one of it one of the things

997
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,040
we need in it grabs on the heavy metals

998
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,760
which robs food away from Epstein bar

999
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,720
that's how you heal parsley that's

1000
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,960
another one that robs metal from Epstein

1001
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,119
bar it does remove some metal but it

1002
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,520
also pushes out Epstein bar toxins

1003
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:12,359
raspberries helps restore the nervous

1004
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:15,079
system which is a result of Epstein bar

1005
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,839
fennel that's another one fennel juice

1006
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,079
you take the bulbs and you juice them

1007
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,079
that helps clean up clean epine bar of

1008
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,280
the system Ginger is another one

1009
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,440
supplements to kill off and lower the

1010
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,040
load knock the viral load over time

1011
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,359
silver hydrol so silver hydrol you know

1012
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,960
you get the best one on the market and

1013
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,440
you take a little bit a little bit at a

1014
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,040
time that's a great one zinc having

1015
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,920
enough zinc the reason why Epstein bar

1016
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,760
has done so much damage to begin with is

1017
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,839
because most of us have a severe zinc

1018
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,960
deficiency there's no zinc left barely

1019
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,400
left in food anymore it's been like this

1020
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,920
for a century and this is another reason

1021
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,200
why Epstein bar is kind of grabbing a

1022
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,200
whole hold you build your zinc reserves

1023
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,559
reserves up long term and you're going

1024
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,240
to be in a better place B12 especially

1025
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,119
the one I talk about the adino silk

1026
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,760
balamin that B12 restores nervous

1027
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,000
systems so you lose your symptoms

1028
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,960
resulted from Epstein bar lemon bomb

1029
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,640
incredible EBV killer Epstein bar killer

1030
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,319
builds up the immune system knocks EBV

1031
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,960
EBV out selenium protects the nervous

1032
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,359
system sparina helps pull Metals away

1033
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,640
from Epstein bar and it's

1034
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,800
antiviral red Marine algae that's a

1035
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:38,359
powerful antiviral too kills off EBV

1036
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,200
Epstein bar monol Lauren breaks down

1037
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:44,200
Epstein bar breaks it down pushes it out

1038
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,040
of the body very important

1039
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,200
Eline Eline someone may say well I've

1040
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,640
taken Eline before now you have to take

1041
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,319
it you have to take a decent amount of

1042
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,720
it what I suggest is you you know you

1043
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,079
you take the supplements I'm talking

1044
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,280
about meaning you take them to your

1045
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,640
practitioner you take them to your

1046
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,880
doctor I take everything I'm saying you

1047
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,040
can take it to your practitioner you can

1048
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,760

1049
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,240
to your doctor and say you know I want

1050
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,079
to take this or that and you have your

1051
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,760
you have your your doctor your your

1052
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,280
naturopath or your functional medicine

1053
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,559
doctor plug plug the wires in and put

1054
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,440
the light bulb on top and just and get

1055
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,760
get active with you and start helping

1056
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,440
because if you're on enough Li scene the

1057
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,280
differences occur licorice root licorice

1058
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,480
root tea or highquality licorice root

1059
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,359
products in incredible for knocking down

1060
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,040
Epstein bar but a lot of people are

1061
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,720
afraid of uh licorice because of certain

1062
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,559
things you know there's meaning because

1063
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,400
of rumors or something it's another

1064
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,520
thing too is is losing fear over some of

1065
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,920
the things some of the rumors or the

1066
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,559
myths or the the fads and trends that

1067
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,160
kind of go in the wrong direction 5 mthf

1068
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:55,359
methylfolate that one's a great one for

1069
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,400
Epstein bar and vitamin C vitamin C

1070
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,520

00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,800
you're already comfortable with and you

1076
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,800
use it it just breaks apart Epstein bar

1077
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,599
and pushes it out of the system now some

1078
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,680
people say well wait a minute can

1079
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,839
Epstein bar really go away can we do

1080
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,000
something about it does it go away it

1081
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:28,520
can can we heal can you kill off epine

1082
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,119

1083
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,760
regain your life and leave some in and

1084
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,359
this is interesting you don't want it

1085
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,240
all gone you want a little bit left it

1086
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,359
prevents you from getting another

1087
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,440
variety of Epstein bar it prevents you

1088
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,240
from Catching another variety of

mononucleosis caused by a different

1090
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,200
variety of Epstein bar so having a

1091
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,359
little bit of your own in is not a bad

1092
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,520
thing it is a good thing but you want to

1093
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,160
knock down as much as you can and you

1094
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,839
gain your life and you gain control and

1095
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,839
you get your life back and you can with

1096
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:06,440
Epstein bar I've watched it I've seen it

1097
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,720
I've seen hundreds do it I have people

1098
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,559
here lived 30 years now completely free

1099
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,760
from every symptom I mentioned and

1100
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,359
they're in their their 70s they're in

1101
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,079
their 80s I have people in that

1102
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,440
condition where they're like gardening

1103
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,359
every day they're exercising they do

1104
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,480
what they want and they were tragically

1105
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:30,720
sick 30 years ago so yes the hope is

1106
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,880
there you keep the faith you can heal

1107
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,000
you can move forward everybody deserves

1108
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,839
to heal you have a god-given right to

1109
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,319

1110
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,040
right it exists and you can heal and you

1111
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,520
can move forward and you have to

1112
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,599
understand this is not your fault that

1113
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,960
you even have symptoms it's not your

1114
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,960
fault that you've even been ill or had

1115
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,720
these conditions or struggled with it

1116
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,119
you didn't create it it's not your fault

1117
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,240
you're a good person you know you didn't

1118
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,800
do this not Karma this isn't Karma and

1119
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,480
you didn't deserve to be sick in this

1120
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,920
lifetime right now you didn't create

1121
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,800
this problem that you have right now

1122
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,400
with Epstein bar this is a virus that's

1123
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,280
been around this is a virus that's been

1124
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,000
around it's not being acknowledged it's

1125
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,200
been here in Family Lines our family

1126
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,359

1127
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,720

have it our grandparents and it gets

1129
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,000
passed on down the line and there's

1130
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,240
things you can do about it and heal and

1131
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,559
when you know about it and you

1132
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,160
understand about it it weakens it see

1133
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,359
see knowing the

1134
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,280
truth that's how you win and it breaks

1135
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:35,839
down and it cleans up and you can push

1136
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,720
it out of your life and push it out of

1137
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,520
your system when it's mysterious and

1138
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,800
nobody knows what's going on and you're

1139
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,559
just sitting there with symptoms and

1140
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,720
you're going to doctor to doctor it's

1141
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,839
harder to get through it it's harder to

1142
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,200
heal but the but the tide has changed

1143
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:51,960
now it's changed this is your time to

1144
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,440
move forward with this and all the

1145
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,440
symptoms you've had this is your time

1146
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,520
and your life right now and everything

1147
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,839
that you've suffered from is valuable

1148
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,160
and not wasted if you've suffered for

1149
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:09,000
years it's valuable it's worth its

1150
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,640
weight and gold Liquid Gold because it's

1151
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,599
information you've learned it's

1152
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,000
experiences you've experienced it's

1153
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:17,559
pushed you to different levels of of

1154
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
spiritual levels it's pushed you into

1155
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,599
different areas of your life that you

1156
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,839
wouldn't achieved different achievements

1157
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,960
that you would have never done so when

1158
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,680
we get challenged by this it's it's a

1159
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,599
good thing it's not a bad thing we just

1160
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,559
don't want to have it anymore we don't

1161
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,800
