[121.76 - 126.32] great great to be here you guys bethany
[124.16 - 128.24] richardson
[126.32 - 130.16] please uh please struggling with bad
[128.24 - 133.44] fatigue but nothing ever shows up
[130.16 - 134.88] any recommendations um
[133.44 - 137.12] what happens with that fatigue no one
[134.88 - 139.04] realizes this out there but that fatigue
[137.12 - 141.44] means there's something going on and i
[139.04 - 142.96] it's really bad fatigue i've always
[141.44 - 145.36] taught doctors that that's
[142.96 - 146.88] called neurological lyme it's something
[145.36 - 148.72] i termed myself
[146.88 - 150.16] between spirit of compassion and i and
[148.72 - 153.76] so that neurological
[150.16 - 155.04] that literal neurological um fatigue
[153.76 - 157.92] you can use either get like a
[155.04 - 159.76] neurological lyme diagnosis down the
[157.92 - 161.76] road which you know you can get any kind
[159.76 - 163.52] of diagnosis so that fatigue gets worse
[161.76 - 164.72] and worse they just don't know
[163.52 - 166.40] and they'll just be like well you got
[164.72 - 168.24] the severe fatigue we're going to have
[166.40 - 170.08] to give it a label eventually
[168.24 - 171.76] lorraine ells on here hi anthony over
[170.08 - 173.60] here from england
[171.76 - 175.20] cool wonder where in england that's so
[173.60 - 178.40] great
[175.20 - 181.52] it's a great place um and
[178.40 - 183.36] so yeah lorena i lost my hypertension
[181.52 - 184.24] diagnosis within a month of eating the
[183.36 - 186.64] mm diet
[184.24 - 188.08] whoa that's a good thing to lose that's
[186.64 - 190.64] a great thing to lose lose your
[188.08 - 194.00] hypertension diagnosis incredible from
[190.64 - 196.24] eating an mm diet that's amazing so that
[194.00 - 198.56] that fatigue is like a neurological
[196.24 - 201.76] fatigue that's what i call it it's very
[198.56 - 203.76] deep it holds us back and
[201.76 - 205.52] if you have that neurological fatigue i
[203.76 - 208.40] almost lost my mind
[205.52 - 211.44] i almost lost my book almost went over
[208.40 - 212.96] my shoulder and down to the floor anyway
[211.44 - 214.48] in here i talk about chronic fatigue
[212.96 - 216.72] syndrome and
[214.48 - 218.64] what to do and i tell doctors all the
[216.72 - 220.16] time what it is it's epstein-barr virus
[218.64 - 222.48] so it's the monovirus but
[220.16 - 224.24] you can't get tested for it easy because
[222.48 - 226.56] it's in a different stage
[224.24 - 227.60] it's not in that beginning stage of mono
[226.56 - 229.68] it's in
[227.60 - 231.44] a later stage and when it's in later
[229.68 - 233.12] stage you have this fatigue and it's
[231.44 - 237.28] from your old mono you had
[233.12 - 239.20] years ago and that's how it works um
[237.28 - 240.32] shawna what's your take on apple cider

[252.00 - 255.92] medical mean podcast apple podcast it's
[253.92 - 257.44] for free i'm not selling anything
[255.92 - 258.88] and i'm not charging anything and
[257.44 - 261.04] there's no commercials on it so i'm not
[258.88 - 263.68] making advertising money which i could
[261.04 - 265.44] i could probably get like 10 advertisers
[263.68 - 267.60] on that podcast and just
[265.44 - 270.16] beat everybody down with commercials 24
[267.60 - 271.68] 7 and make a bundle of money but i don't
[270.16 - 273.36] want to do that i want you guys to have
[271.68 - 274.72] an experience when you're on the medical
[273.36 - 276.72] meeting podcast
[274.72 - 278.08] and just not have to put up with that
[276.72 - 279.84] stuff at least for now
[278.08 - 281.20] maybe if i bring something on there down
[279.84 - 282.24] the road you'll forgive me but i'm not
[281.20 - 285.60] planning on it
[282.24 - 287.28] claudine iaw got my son to drink the
[285.60 - 290.80] celery juice every morning
[287.28 - 292.96] and his skin condition is clearing up
[290.80 - 294.32] miracle and you know what's funny you
[292.96 - 298.08] know what's funny about that
[294.32 - 298.40] all these naysayers and health gurus
[298.08 - 300.24] that
[298.40 - 301.92] hate the fact that medical media put out
[300.24 - 303.28] the celery juice in the world they hate
[301.92 - 306.16] the fact that celery juice
[303.28 - 307.68] has been dominating the health scene for
[306.16 - 310.32] quite some time now
[307.68 - 311.68] they hate it and so they'll tell people
[310.32 - 313.28] stay away from celery juice you
[311.68 - 315.28] shouldn't be juicing celery juice oh
[313.28 - 315.84] it's got too much bad or it's not good
[315.28 - 319.20] right
[315.84 - 322.24] meanwhile they're stealing some
[319.20 - 323.04] some child's chance of clearing up their
[322.24 - 326.88] skin
[323.04 - 329.44] or a child's chance of healing or
[326.88 - 331.04] mommy's chance of healing or someone
[329.44 - 332.08] getting their life back they're robbing
[331.04 - 334.64] people of that
[332.08 - 335.36] because they're demented or something
[334.64 - 337.20] because
[335.36 - 338.56] they don't want people to heal and
[337.20 - 340.80] there's just something terribly wrong
[338.56 - 344.64] about that
[340.80 - 347.04] this is so cool um jennifer fonz do you
[344.64 - 350.64] know anything about pots and how can i
[347.04 - 352.00] help my daughter the thing is about pots
[350.64 - 353.60] is pots as always and i've talked
[352.00 - 355.44] about this the doc you could tell your
[353.60 - 357.68] doctor this i talk to i teach doctors
[355.44 - 361.04] this all the time pots is viral
[357.68 - 364.56] and um so it's low grade viral so if
[361.04 - 366.32] i had if i had a friend or
[364.56 - 368.48] someone else is that they're dealing
[366.32 - 369.92] with pots i always say we've got to go
[368.48 - 372.56] anti-viral or at least
[369.92 - 374.80] take away foods that could feed the
[372.56 - 375.92] virus so maybe take the gluten away a
[374.80 - 378.24] little bit
[375.92 - 381.04] and just move it aside maybe do
[378.24 - 384.08] gluten-free things that could be helpful
[381.04 - 386.84] maybe do take away the dairy products
[384.08 - 388.48] and the eggs a little bit bring in more
[386.84 - 391.12] avocados
[388.48 - 393.60] bring in more potatoes and that could be
[391.12 - 396.48] helpful just these little switches alone
[393.60 - 398.72] are really really helpful um and then
[396.48 - 400.16] b12 is really important too you can ask
[398.72 - 404.88] your doctor if this will
[400.16 - 407.84] be fine but b12 that's the vimer gp12
[404.88 - 410.64] v is in victor i am as in mary ergy i'm
[407.84 - 413.84] not sponsored i don't own a company i
[410.64 - 414.16] recommend a lot of products and i get to
[413.84 - 415.60] know
[414.16 - 417.60] all these companies that are doing the
[415.60 - 418.80] right thing and making sure the products
[417.60 - 421.44] are incredible
[418.80 - 422.40] but i don't i'm not sponsored i just
[421.44 - 424.40] don't like that whole
[422.40 - 425.52] route of being sponsored i mean anybody
[424.40 - 427.12] else would love to be
[425.52 - 429.44] they probably would love to be in the
[427.12 - 430.72] health field sponsored because
[429.44 - 432.64] that would be the greatest you think
[430.72 - 435.76] about that you know they'd be like yeah
[432.64 - 438.16] but i don't want to um
[435.76 - 439.52] and you can get more information
[438.16 - 441.36] anything autoimmune
[439.52 - 443.04] anything like that you can get more
[441.36 - 444.64] information in here i mean it's packed
[443.04 - 445.84] with information if you guys don't have
[444.64 - 447.92] the book
[445.84 - 451.36] cleanse the heal let's cleanse the heal
[447.92 - 454.40] elizabeth ruby i have ptsd depression
[451.36 - 456.56] um it's awful to have that i
[454.40 - 458.96] i talk about ptsd all the time i talk
[456.56 - 461.20] about depression all the time
[458.96 - 463.12] i have an anxiety show at medical media
[461.20 - 464.56] podcast at apple podcast i have this
[463.12 - 466.48] anxiety show that you might want to
[464.56 - 469.20] listen to
[466.48 - 470.96] meds and therapy no longer work any
[469.20 - 473.12] suggestions i've tried anything
[470.96 - 474.16] elizabeth if it was me that i had this
[473.12 - 477.36] depression
[474.16 - 480.16] and i had this ptsd i would
[477.36 - 482.00] i would try to get something called the
[480.16 - 485.52] toxic heavy metals out of
[482.00 - 486.00] my body because the reason why we have
[485.52 - 489.36] this
[486.00 - 491.68] mystery depression this mystery ptsd
[489.36 - 493.60] and even mystery anxieties because we
[491.68 - 496.88] have toxic heavy metals
[493.60 - 498.32] inside our brain and to get that metal
[496.88 - 499.68] out of our brain
[498.32 - 501.68] we need to make sure we're doing like
[499.68 - 502.64] the heavy metal detox movies and things
[501.68 - 506.00] like that there's a
[502.64 - 508.56] heavy metal detox cleansing here
[506.00 - 510.00] this is what i would do and it's in here
[508.56 - 511.36] to get metals out so you can put
[510.00 - 514.00] depression behind you
[511.36 - 515.04] i'd also try the meditations they're
[514.00 - 517.76] really healing
[515.04 - 519.52] really powerful so the moon meditation
[517.76 - 522.64] the stargazing meditation
[519.52 - 524.40] the brain meditation medical medium
[522.64 - 526.88] podcast at apple podcast it's for
[524.40 - 529.04] emotional the emotional side
[526.88 - 530.80] because you got the emotional side that
[529.04 - 532.40] needs some help and healing
[530.80 - 534.00] and then you got the physical side so
[532.40 - 535.12] you take the toxic heavy metals out of
[534.00 - 536.72] the physical side
[535.12 - 538.48] and then you help the emotional side
[536.72 - 540.40] with the powerful meditations and all
[538.48 - 543.68] this information is from above

[669.28 - 671.76] medicine we got chinese medicine doctor
[671.12 - 673.68] here too
[671.76 - 675.36] and we're pulling that in and that that
[673.68 - 676.96] doctor wants us to try all these herbs
[675.36 - 679.28] but it's all guessing games
[676.96 - 680.96] and random crap everywhere but we're
[679.28 - 683.20] still sick with our lupus
[680.96 - 684.72] and how do we get better and in the end
[683.20 - 686.32] many of them just take little tidbits
[684.72 - 687.52] from original medical medium information
[686.32 - 689.44] from 30 years ago
[687.52 - 690.56] which is since i was there at the
[689.44 - 692.24] beginning which is
[690.56 - 694.08] get rid of gluten which came from
[692.24 - 695.76] homemade really because no one was off
[694.08 - 697.52] of gluten 35 years ago
[695.76 - 698.80] and then do this and do this and this is
[697.52 - 700.72] how it works and it's really kind of
[698.80 - 704.16] crazy but what i'm saying is
[700.72 - 705.84] it's not easy out there and
[704.16 - 709.36] hey you know what can i say it's not
[705.84 - 711.60] easy so we want to get people better
[709.36 - 713.20] try to get the information with lupus
[711.60 - 716.32] it's viral
[713.20 - 717.20] and you want to get that viral thing out
[716.32 - 719.76] of you
[717.20 - 723.28] and they just don't know see when we
[719.76 - 726.64] walk around with lupus nobody knows
