[266.16 - 269.04] a little bit i just showed you what i'm
[267.44 - 271.52] going to make in a little bit too
[269.04 - 272.24] smoky mountain paradise nice to see you
[271.52 - 274.32] guys
[272.24 - 275.84] incredible incredible i'm honored you're
[274.32 - 278.88] here
[275.84 - 282.48] all right so supplement section
[278.88 - 283.84] on page 57 of this book so i want to get
[282.48 - 286.80] to there right now
[283.84 - 288.08] right so when someone has autoimmune
[286.80 - 290.00] because that's what's going to happen
[288.08 - 291.28] you're going to everybody maybe you
[290.00 - 293.36] maybe your friend maybe your family
[291.28 - 296.08] member can be diagnosed with autoimmune
[293.36 - 297.12] okay you may not be told it's autoimmune
[296.08 - 299.60] right away
[297.12 - 301.20] but you you'll be given a diagnosis
[299.60 - 302.32] because that's what happens and here's
[301.20 - 305.12] the direction
[302.32 - 306.00] of medical research and science right
[305.12 - 309.44] now okay
[306.00 - 312.16] the direction is for everybody
[309.44 - 314.00] to get a diagnosis that ends up falling
[312.16 - 315.76] in the category of autoimmune
[314.00 - 317.36] so that's the direction like that's
[315.76 - 319.44] their goal and
[317.36 - 322.24] their goal is to make sure that
[319.44 - 325.28] everybody is in the direction of
[322.24 - 326.16] the of autoimmune their goal is to be in
[325.28 - 328.72] that direction
[326.16 - 330.56] because it takes the blame off of
[328.72 - 333.52] medical research and science
[330.56 - 333.92] that's what the autoimmune tag is about
[333.52 - 336.00] so
[333.92 - 338.32] you can get a name you can get a brand
[336.00 - 340.88] new name for your illness
[338.32 - 342.48] this year coming on and the year after
[340.88 - 343.92] this year and the year after this year
[342.48 - 346.56] next few years there's going to be a lot
[343.92 - 350.48] of new diagnoses coming on
[346.56 - 351.92] a lot of new names developing
[350.48 - 353.88] because a lot of people are going to
[351.92 - 356.96] have a lot of new
[353.88 - 358.96] neurological problems big
[356.96 - 360.40] time i don't know if you guys know what
[358.96 - 362.08] i'm talking about
[360.40 - 363.52] i don't know if any of you guys know
[362.08 - 364.96] michelle i just saw you come on each
[363.52 - 366.56] other good to see you
[364.96 - 369.36] um yep it's all autoimmune all the time
[366.56 - 371.76] you chota it's your fault
[369.36 - 372.96] it's your fault right your body's fault
[371.76 - 376.00] okay
[372.96 - 377.44] and uh margaret says yeah oats have more
[376.00 - 378.84] fat they do they do they have a little
[377.44 - 381.52] bit more it's true
[378.84 - 383.44] so what happens is they need to funnel
[381.52 - 385.28] the medical industry needs the funnel
[383.44 - 387.12] your aches and pains your tingles and
[385.28 - 388.80] numbness your burning skin
[387.12 - 390.48] your pain in your ear your neck your
[388.80 - 393.36] back pain in your teeth
[390.48 - 394.08] your pain in your feet your your um
[393.36 - 397.60] every
[394.08 - 401.20] you know everything everything there is
[397.60 - 404.16] um your you know your all
[401.20 - 406.32] your body's symptoms are gonna get
[404.16 - 407.60] funneled into autoimmune that's where
[406.32 - 410.00] they're gonna get funneled into so i'm
[407.60 - 414.56] just letting you know
[410.00 - 414.56] and and
[414.64 - 418.72] most all of these diseases and symptoms
[417.60 - 422.40] are going to
[418.72 - 424.88] end up being neurological okay
[422.40 - 426.32] that's what they are and so there's
[424.88 - 427.60] going to be coming like
[426.32 - 429.44] so many people already dealing with
[427.60 - 431.04] neurological symptoms right they're
[429.44 - 431.36] already dealing with it be open-hearted
[431.04 - 432.80] good
[431.36 - 434.48] good to check out those greens right be
[432.80 - 437.60] open-hearted check it out right
[434.48 - 440.88] cilantro parsley um
[437.60 - 443.04] romaine lettuce yup so
[440.88 - 445.12] coming up okay we've already everybody's
[443.04 - 445.80] already out there dealing with symptoms
[445.12 - 448.80] right
[445.80 - 450.64] 250 million americans alone
[448.80 - 453.20] in the u.s have symptoms that are
[450.64 - 456.72] neurological 250
[453.20 - 459.28] million have neurological symptoms right
[456.72 - 460.40] even if they're mild to really mild just
[459.28 - 464.08] headaches
[460.40 - 466.40] okay maybe some tingles once in a while
[464.08 - 467.44] but they got them right they got them
[466.40 - 470.16] but
[467.44 - 470.80] coming pretty soon in these next few
[470.16 - 472.88] years
[470.80 - 475.28] is going to be neurological symptoms and
[472.88 - 477.76] an epic proportion
[475.28 - 479.60] never seen before in our history all
[477.76 - 484.08] right that's what's coming
[479.60 - 485.20] and so um
[484.08 - 487.12] and i you know and i've got to be
[485.20 - 488.56] careful to what degree and what i say
[487.12 - 491.76] about this so i won't go into
[488.56 - 494.08] those details but they're coming
[491.76 - 496.00] anyway so medical medium information is
[494.08 - 497.12] going to be needed more than ever before
[496.00 - 499.44] in history it already
[497.12 - 500.72] is and it's being used but man what's
[499.44 - 503.84] coming it's going to be
[500.72 - 506.00] really on a level no one's ever seen
[503.84 - 507.36] but all these symptoms that people are
[506.00 - 510.16] going to be getting
[507.36 - 511.92] are all going to be lumped into
[510.16 - 513.52] autoimmune they're going to be packaged
[511.92 - 515.20] up they'll come up with new names but
[513.52 - 517.36] they're going to be packaged up to
[515.20 - 518.48] autoimmune right so what the medical
[517.36 - 521.12] industry is going to do is they're going
[518.48 - 522.88] to funnel all of that to autoimmune
[521.12 - 524.72] and send it all the way into the
[522.88 - 526.40] autoimmune basket
[524.72 - 528.00] autoimmune autoimmune it's just going to
[526.40 - 529.36] go all the way in there and the reason
[528.00 - 531.12] why is it protects
[529.36 - 533.20] medical research and science because
[531.12 - 534.00] it's put on you so now it's all your
[533.20 - 537.12] fault
[534.00 - 539.20] it's all your body's fault and and we we
[537.12 - 540.24] we can easily get sucked into that one
[539.20 - 542.56] i'm sick
[540.24 - 544.00] i got some fatigue i can't explain it i
[542.56 - 547.44] got brain fog
[544.00 - 548.16] i got flashing lights in my eyes i can't
[547.44 - 550.64] see i'm
[548.16 - 551.68] dizzy all the time i'm in i can't find
[550.64 - 554.88] my balance
[551.68 - 556.72] i'm not feeling good it is my fault it
[554.88 - 558.72] is because my doctor says
[556.72 - 560.88] i got autoimmune and so if i got
[558.72 - 562.64] autoimmune that means that my body is
[560.88 - 566.08] attacking itself
[562.64 - 568.00] so that's where it goes so um
[566.08 - 569.76] anyway and the reason why it goes into
[568.00 - 571.68] autoimmune like i said is to protect the
[569.76 - 574.84] medical industry that's one of the big
[571.68 - 576.08] reasons and autoimmune means cause
[574.84 - 578.24] unknown
[576.08 - 580.24] that's what it means so they say well
[578.24 - 582.40] it's your body turning against itself
[580.24 - 583.68] it's your body's immune system attacking
[582.40 - 586.72] your glands
[583.68 - 590.16] and your organs but still
[586.72 - 591.84] cause unknown they don't know why
[590.16 - 593.36] your immune system is attacking your
[591.84 - 595.04] organs but your
[593.36 - 596.88] immune system isn't attacking its organs
[595.04 - 598.88] that's just the theory that's just their
[596.88 - 599.84] theory their excuse if that's what it
[598.88 - 602.32] might be
[599.84 - 604.00] that's what it must be because here at
[602.32 - 605.84] medical research and science we know
[604.00 - 607.68] everything and when medical research
[605.84 - 609.68] decides knows everything then
[607.68 - 611.52] you're the one that's got the problem
[609.68 - 612.00] it's your body's faulty and that's how
[611.52 - 614.48] it works
[612.00 - 616.00] anyway um and i want to talk about
[614.48 - 616.96] neurological symptoms a little bit so i
[616.00 - 620.32] got the brain
[616.96 - 623.36] in there too so
[620.32 - 625.60] when medical medium books are
[623.36 - 626.88] fairly easy to use you just have to
[625.60 - 629.76] spend a little energy
[626.88 - 631.76] and get familiar with them right so
[629.76 - 635.12] that's medical medium new edition i also
[631.76 - 635.12] have cleanse the heel right here too
[636.56 - 641.44] on page 57 it says supplements for
[639.60 - 644.40] autoimmune disorders
[641.44 - 646.96] and diseases okay later stage
[644.40 - 649.68] epstein-barr because
[646.96 - 650.64] medical median books has revealed the
[649.68 - 653.44] truth about
[650.64 - 655.84] autoimmune diseases being viral so
[653.44 - 659.84] that's epstein-barr
[655.84 - 661.76] so it says including lupus and r.a
[659.84 - 664.72] rheumatoid arthritis right
[661.76 - 666.32] um and if you look here it says if you
[664.72 - 668.08] have a condition
[666.32 - 669.60] that is not listed in this chapter and
[668.08 - 671.36] yet your symptoms match up to
[669.60 - 672.00] epstein-barr so it's about learning
[671.36 - 674.72] about your
[672.00 - 675.84] symptoms because the symptoms match up
[674.72 - 678.00] to epstein-barr
[675.84 - 679.60] the tingles the numbness right
[678.00 - 682.32] unexplained aches and pains
[679.60 - 682.96] even plantar fasciitis that sepstein bar
[682.32 - 685.20] you know

[1059.28 - 1063.68] books and finding
[1060.64 - 1065.68] those supplements that's one option
[1063.68 - 1066.88] knowing what foods to remove that's
[1065.68 - 1068.64] another option too

[1133.28 - 1137.12] know how or what or where
[1134.96 - 1138.48] and then that's the next level it's
[1137.12 - 1140.88] about going that
[1138.48 - 1142.40] next level so it's important and then
[1140.88 - 1143.60] that's the supplement protocols in this
[1142.40 - 1144.24] book are for people looking for
[1143.60 - 1145.76] something more
[1144.24 - 1148.48] looking for options because their
[1145.76 - 1150.80] situations are perplexing to them
[1148.48 - 1151.92] right if you know anybody right if
[1150.80 - 1153.92] that's you
[1151.92 - 1155.36] then delve into the treasure trove of
[1153.92 - 1157.12] options in the form of specialized
[1155.36 - 1158.96] supplement lists for individual symptoms
[1157.12 - 1161.68] and conditions in this book so you
[1158.96 - 1162.88] can delve into that specialization
[1161.68 - 1164.72] that's in here
[1162.88 - 1166.56] okay it's important to know that our
[1164.72 - 1167.28] deficiencies are a big part of why we're
[1166.56 - 1169.76] sick so
[1167.28 - 1170.64] deficiencies a big part of why we're
[1169.76 - 1173.76] sick
[1170.64 - 1174.80] zinc for example is practically
[1173.76 - 1178.32] non-existent
[1174.80 - 1181.60] in our food today so zinc
[1178.32 - 1184.96] is non-existent in our food today
[1181.60 - 1186.96] animal proteins all of it alike
[1184.96 - 1189.28] all right some in secrets behind chronic
[1186.96 - 1191.28] mystery illness and how to finally heal
[1189.28 - 1193.68] and then do addition critical
[1191.28 - 1196.96] information for people that need to heal
[1193.68 - 1199.76] need to move forward so zinc
[1196.96 - 1200.64] is a deficiency everybody has so the
[1199.76 - 1203.04] reason why
[1200.64 - 1204.72] people don't move forward in many
[1203.04 - 1205.68] situations is because they're zinc
[1204.72 - 1209.28] deficient
[1205.68 - 1211.52] so this is an example right here
[1209.28 - 1212.72] a zinc deficiency lowers the immune
[1211.52 - 1214.88] system
[1212.72 - 1216.48] so we're always in need of it so a zinc
[1214.88 - 1219.52] deficiency
[1216.48 - 1221.60] lowers our immune system
[1219.52 - 1223.92] so then we become more susceptible
[1221.60 - 1228.24] austin good to see you tonight
[1223.92 - 1230.24] all right um just so important
[1228.24 - 1231.76] we also have a lot of toxic heavy metals
[1230.24 - 1235.12] in us and
[1231.76 - 1235.76] spirulina spirulina is critical for
[1235.12 - 1238.56] removing
[1235.76 - 1239.76] the toxic heavy metals so you guys see
[1238.56 - 1241.60] where it's going
[1239.76 - 1243.36] you see where you got different options
[1241.60 - 1244.48] you can start with hey i'll start with a
[1243.36 - 1246.56] little celery juice
[1244.48 - 1247.52] let me remove a few foods that's fine
[1246.56 - 1249.20] too right
[1247.52 - 1251.20] what kind of foods well he talks about
[1249.20 - 1253.76] in here let's remove some foods
[1251.20 - 1255.92] okay so that's right there and then it's
[1253.76 - 1257.68] like well i want to move along quicker i
[1255.92 - 1259.04] want to get this further along i want to
[1257.68 - 1260.32] make this happen so let's
[1259.04 - 1262.08] get into some of the supplements he's
[1260.32 - 1263.84] saying everybody's got zinc deficiencies
[1262.08 - 1266.48] so i'm showing you guys how this works
[1263.84 - 1268.08] everybody's got zinc deficiencies so and
[1266.48 - 1269.76] that's why it's important
[1268.08 - 1271.20] so that's a zinc right there so that's
[1269.76 - 1273.12] the vimergy zinc right
[1271.20 - 1274.48] and that's the one i use for my friends
[1273.12 - 1275.68] and family and
[1274.48 - 1278.00] there's a supplement directory at
[1275.68 - 1278.96] medicalmedium.com so you know the safest
[1278.00 - 1281.04] stuff
[1278.96 - 1282.80] more effective stuff without the alcohol
[1281.04 - 1284.56] and the natural flavors and the msg and
[1282.80 - 1287.36] everything else that goes wrong
[1284.56 - 1289.36] and so the point is is like just the
[1287.36 - 1290.96] zinc deficiency alone can move
[1289.36 - 1293.04] someone forward so if someone's got the
[1290.96 - 1294.40] tinnitus they got the vertigo
[1293.04 - 1296.16] they got the burning skin they got the
[1294.40 - 1297.92] aches and pains they got the fatigue
[1296.16 - 1300.48] they get their autoimmune diagnosis if
[1297.92 - 1303.04] someone has that autoimmune diagnosis
[1300.48 - 1304.80] whatever it is you can look up your your
[1303.04 - 1306.56] diagnosis to see if it's listed under
[1304.80 - 1307.36] autoimmune right you can look that up
[1306.56 - 1310.48] out there
[1307.36 - 1313.92] but if you have an autoimmune condition
[1310.48 - 1315.12] you'll see zinc inside the book right
[1313.92 - 1318.32] here and then you'll see
[1315.12 - 1321.20] dosages okay and a zinc deficiency
[1318.32 - 1321.92] is a big one for people that's a huge
[1321.20 - 1324.40] one it's a
[1321.92 - 1326.16] zinc up to two dropper fulls twice a day
[1324.40 - 1327.68] so someone with autoimmune it gives you
[1326.16 - 1331.28] the dosages right here
[1327.68 - 1335.52] up to two dropper fulls twice a day
[1331.28 - 1338.32] of zinc so i'm giving you guys a window
[1335.52 - 1339.44] into how to heal take take all this to
[1338.32 - 1341.12] your doctor if your doctor
[1339.44 - 1342.48] you know supports it your doctor
[1341.12 - 1343.76] supports if he doesn't just do what your
[1342.48 - 1346.32] doctor says
[1343.76 - 1346.96] but the bottom line is i'm giving you
[1346.32 - 1350.00] options
[1346.96 - 1352.48] and the zinc deficiency is one of those
[1350.00 - 1355.20] problems that everybody is living with
[1352.48 - 1357.44] so when anybody gets a new condition
[1355.20 - 1359.92] they get a new problem that zinc
[1357.44 - 1360.88] deficiency is going to get in their way
[1359.92 - 1362.00] big time now
[1360.88 - 1363.28] you can just start it you could be
[1362.00 - 1365.36] someone and you start out with just a
[1363.28 - 1368.96] couple of tiny drops where it's
[1365.36 - 1369.92] literally just a drop and not the dosage
[1368.96 - 1371.44] that's in the book
[1369.92 - 1373.60] ask your doctor what's right for you but
[1371.44 - 1376.24] that's you know so when i tell
[1373.60 - 1377.68] doctors or friends and family hey this
[1376.24 - 1379.60] is how you use the book i'm giving you
[1377.68 - 1383.44] guys that window now

[1399.36 - 1403.20] this is actually a real phone call right
[1401.20 - 1405.44] now this is i have it hooked up right
[1403.20 - 1405.44] now
[1405.84 - 1412.24] this is a real one okay um
[1409.76 - 1413.28] what did your doctor say your doctor
[1412.24 - 1415.04] said that
[1413.28 - 1418.00] you don't have you don't have a zinc
[1415.04 - 1420.24] deficiency how would he know
[1418.00 - 1421.76] how would your doctor know that he
[1420.24 - 1424.64] doesn't he does
[1421.76 - 1426.24] he doesn't doesn't really know does your
[1424.64 - 1428.88] doctor know that
[1426.24 - 1431.44] that you have epstein-barr he doesn't
[1428.88 - 1432.96] believe it he doesn't think so
[1431.44 - 1434.96] okay so he doesn't think you have
[1432.96 - 1436.88] epstein-barr all right
[1434.96 - 1439.36] so what does he think your tingles and
[1436.88 - 1442.00] numbness and your fatigue is
[1439.36 - 1442.88] and you're ringing in the ears and your
[1442.00 - 1444.40] dizziness
[1442.88 - 1446.32] and your brain fog what does he think it
[1444.40 - 1450.56] is he thinks
[1446.32 - 1453.20] he thinks it's your telomeres okay
[1450.56 - 1454.64] so what's he saying it's genetic oh okay
[1453.20 - 1456.80] so he thinks it's your genes
[1454.64 - 1457.84] all right so he thinks he thinks it's
[1456.80 - 1460.40] your genes
[1457.84 - 1461.12] okay um what did your last doctor say
[1460.40 - 1462.72] didn't you have a
[1461.12 - 1465.44] didn't you have a better doctor before
[1462.72 - 1466.24] that oh he said it was parasites in your
[1465.44 - 1468.40] gut
[1466.24 - 1469.36] what did he do he gave you a whole bunch
[1468.40 - 1472.72] of gut health
[1469.36 - 1476.24] probiotics did it help it didn't
[1472.72 - 1479.20] all right he said that you had parasites
[1476.24 - 1480.16] okay well did it did it fix it what did
[1479.20 - 1482.56] he do
[1480.16 - 1484.24] all right it didn't fix it what did your
[1482.56 - 1486.16] last doctor do though didn't you have a
[1484.24 - 1488.64] pretty good doctor before that
[1486.16 - 1489.28] that doctor got you on a keto diet
[1488.64 - 1490.96] really
[1489.28 - 1493.04] it kind of helped a little bit because
[1490.96 - 1494.56] he got you off of oh got you off of
[1493.04 - 1496.72] those processed foods
[1494.56 - 1498.32] okay all right well that's good at least
[1496.72 - 1501.36] he got you off some processed foods
[1498.32 - 1503.68] right what did he say your problem was
[1501.36 - 1504.56] he said that your body was attacking
[1503.68 - 1506.64] itself
[1504.56 - 1508.80] so you had like an autoimmune and your
[1506.64 - 1511.52] body was attacking itself all right
[1508.80 - 1513.76] what did your doctor say before that so
[1511.52 - 1516.80] you had a doctor before that he said
[1513.76 - 1518.80] he said that you you it was idiopathic
[1516.80 - 1520.08] all your symptoms just they weren't
[1518.80 - 1521.28] really real because you couldn't find
[1520.08 - 1524.40] anything wrong
[1521.28 - 1527.44] that's your fourth doctor really
[1524.40 - 1528.88] well all right well look all i know is

[1567.76 - 1570.96] section to how you use the supplements
[1569.76 - 1572.24] and if you look down the line for
[1570.96 - 1574.08] autoimmune you'll see the different
[1572.24 - 1574.64] supplements you'll see lemon balm in
[1574.08 - 1577.12] here

[1598.80 - 1602.00] before you can start with the celery
[1600.48 - 1603.60] juice that's one option right there you
[1602.00 - 1604.96] can take away the no foods you can take
[1603.60 - 1605.92] away the foods that are troublemaker
[1604.96 - 1609.68] foods
[1605.92 - 1612.96] okay so i'm in here
[1609.68 - 1614.08] critical critical tips all right so
[1612.96 - 1615.52] where to start
[1614.08 - 1617.20] once you've found your symptom or
[1615.52 - 1618.72] condition okay
[1617.20 - 1621.04] remember that once you've found your
[1618.72 - 1623.92] symptom or condition in the books
[1621.04 - 1624.40] and you learn about what is wrong like
[1623.92 - 1626.00] why
[1624.40 - 1627.84] am i dealing with the symptom or
[1626.00 - 1629.76] condition all right
[1627.84 - 1631.04] you don't need to take every supplement
[1629.76 - 1634.24] listed in here
[1631.04 - 1635.60] for it if you're sensitive you can try
[1634.24 - 1637.52] one supplement a day
[1635.60 - 1638.96] if not you can put them all together as
[1637.52 - 1640.64] your daily regimen
[1638.96 - 1642.64] as a middle ground you can choose a
[1640.64 - 1643.76] couple to start with and then take it
[1642.64 - 1646.00] from there
[1643.76 - 1648.72] celery juice is always a good place to
[1646.00 - 1650.16] begin beyond that vitamin b12 is another
[1648.72 - 1651.68] place
[1650.16 - 1654.08] so that's the b12 right there that's the
[1651.68 - 1655.12] beemer's eb12 can ask your doctor what's
[1654.08 - 1656.56] right for you
[1655.12 - 1658.56] perfectly fine you can take this to your
[1656.56 - 1659.28] doctor see if your doctor agrees with it
[1658.56 - 1660.64] or not
[1659.28 - 1663.04] i want you guys to do whatever you feel
[1660.64 - 1664.40] like you know you need to do
[1663.04 - 1666.64] i recommend family and friends like
[1664.40 - 1668.80] that's the b12 so that's an example
[1666.64 - 1670.72] zinc is another another one too so a
[1668.80 - 1673.76] good place to start is the zinc
[1670.72 - 1676.72] the b12 the vitamin c
[1673.76 - 1678.40] so vitamin c is the the microc is the
[1676.72 - 1678.88] one i use right there so that's the one
[1678.40 - 1681.04] i use
[1678.88 - 1682.16] you guys can use what you want to use
[1681.04 - 1684.40] but there's reason why
[1682.16 - 1686.16] i like the better stuff because the
[1684.40 - 1689.44] details matter because you
[1686.16 - 1692.72] you move forward so much better okay
[1689.44 - 1693.76] and lemon balm so it's it's that's a
[1692.72 - 1695.36] place to start
[1693.76 - 1697.92] when you're when you're dealing with a
[1695.36 - 1700.40] problem it's like you got the b12 you
[1697.92 - 1703.04] got the vitamin c you got the lemon balm
[1700.40 - 1705.12] you got the zinc that's a great place to
[1703.04 - 1706.72] start okay
[1705.12 - 1709.20] bring in those then if you're ready to
[1706.72 - 1713.36] move forward and your list contains
[1709.20 - 1715.52] spirulina curcumin cat's claw or lysine
[1713.36 - 1717.12] those are the next ones in so there's
[1715.52 - 1719.84] the spirulina right
[1717.12 - 1721.44] and then there's the cat's claw right
[1719.84 - 1724.32] and then there's the lysine
[1721.44 - 1725.60] right here okay and and you can bring
[1724.32 - 1728.32] those in next
[1725.60 - 1730.16] and add those in later on if you're not
[1728.32 - 1731.20] experiencing what you want from these
[1730.16 - 1733.12] supplements
[1731.20 - 1735.04] you can add a few more from your list
[1733.12 - 1736.56] and you can always take smaller amounts
[1735.04 - 1737.52] than the listed dosages if you're
[1736.56 - 1739.44] sensitive
[1737.52 - 1740.80] right you also have the option to enter
[1739.44 - 1742.56] mixed supplements from the different
[1740.80 - 1743.28] lists in the book any supplement from
[1742.56 - 1752.80] this book
[1743.28 - 1758.16] is an option to use
[1752.80 - 1758.16] so um sun moon you got a question
[1758.48 - 1763.36] it's do we take the supplements with
[1760.96 - 1766.00] food or without food
[1763.36 - 1767.36] okay the book sun sun moon good question
[1766.00 - 1767.84] sun moon love that's a really cool
[1767.36 - 1771.52] handle
[1767.84 - 1774.24] it's an awesome handle um yeah you can
[1771.52 - 1776.16] you can you got to read the book right
[1774.24 - 1779.36] and you'll find it in there
[1776.16 - 1781.52] so the answer will be in there okay um
[1779.36 - 1782.80] you don't have to take supplements with
[1781.52 - 1785.60] food
[1782.80 - 1786.24] or without food okay you can go either
[1785.60 - 1788.32] or
[1786.24 - 1790.08] and that's important to know because
[1788.32 - 1793.76] here's how it works it's like
[1790.08 - 1794.08] people will people will take supplements
[1793.76 - 1795.84] with
[1794.08 - 1798.00] no food at all so they'll just take the
[1795.84 - 1799.44] supplements and no food
[1798.00 - 1801.28] and when people just take the
[1799.44 - 1803.76] supplements and no food
[1801.28 - 1804.88] okay they don't have enough glucose in
[1803.76 - 1808.48] their bloodstream so
[1804.88 - 1810.40] glucose is really important so eating
[1808.48 - 1812.16] some time before supplements or eating
[1810.40 - 1813.60] sometime after supplements is always a
[1812.16 - 1814.88] good idea that's what i that's what i've
[1813.60 - 1816.16] always told doctors to tell their
[1814.88 - 1818.64] patients
[1816.16 - 1820.24] you can do what your doctor wants you to
[1818.64 - 1820.80] do in the whole bid and whatever feels
[1820.24 - 1823.60] good
[1820.80 - 1824.32] but i like having some kind of glucose
[1823.60 - 1826.72] present
[1824.32 - 1828.32] with supplements for myself when i take
[1826.72 - 1829.52] them so when i take supplements and this
[1828.32 - 1832.64] is for everybody here
[1829.52 - 1835.28] too i'll take my supplements with like
[1832.64 - 1837.20] uh my shot glass of wild blueberry juice
[1835.28 - 1838.80] i'll take my supplements with because
[1837.20 - 1840.08] there's a glucose in there
[1838.80 - 1842.64] i'll take my supplements with some
[1840.08 - 1843.20] coconut water i'll take my supplements
[1842.64 - 1844.72] i'll have an
[1843.20 - 1846.56] apple after i've had my supplements i'll
[1844.72 - 1848.08] have the medical medium smoothie of
[1846.56 - 1849.60] course the smoothies that i do all the
[1848.08 - 1852.32] time for myself
[1849.60 - 1852.96] lemon water with honey in it is a great
[1852.32 - 1854.56] one too
[1852.96 - 1856.40] like that's a great one but i like
[1854.56 - 1858.00] having a little glucose a really good
[1856.40 - 1859.44] question but you can you can do it you
[1858.00 - 1861.28] can do it without food and you can do it
[1859.44 - 1863.44] with food i like having a little bit of
[1861.28 - 1866.40] glucose that's what i like
[1863.44 - 1868.80] definitely if you're sensitive food is
[1866.40 - 1870.48] actually always a great way to go
[1868.80 - 1872.64] so as i was saying like a great place to
[1870.48 - 1874.00] start is some of the basic supplements
[1872.64 - 1876.72] that are really important
[1874.00 - 1878.16] and i've seen in so many situations
[1876.72 - 1880.32] people dealing with symptoms
[1878.16 - 1881.60] where they just use a handful of medical
[1880.32 - 1884.56] medium tools
[1881.60 - 1885.36] and they'll use the troublemaker foods
[1884.56 - 1887.36] they'll get out
[1885.36 - 1889.92] they're like okay aw i got rid of the
[1887.36 - 1892.24] milk cheese the butter the pork i went a
[1889.92 - 1894.24] little further i got rid of the corn
[1892.24 - 1895.60] i got rid of the you know of that right
[1894.24 - 1897.12] there so they move that out
[1895.60 - 1898.96] i got rid of the gluten so they move
[1897.12 - 1900.48] that out of the way and then
[1898.96 - 1902.16] it's like what do i need to do now let
[1900.48 - 1904.40] me bring in some celery juice
[1902.16 - 1906.08] and then they bring in some celery juice
[1904.40 - 1907.20] okay and then now they're there now
[1906.08 - 1908.88] they're making a couple of medical
[1907.20 - 1910.32] medium recipes now they're doing the
[1908.88 - 1912.24] healing broth
[1910.32 - 1913.92] and they're like okay i'm getting better
[1912.24 - 1915.76] i'm getting better i'm getting better
[1913.92 - 1917.28] but i'm not where i want to be yet but
[1915.76 - 1919.60] i'm getting better so i know
[1917.28 - 1920.96] i'm on the way what do i need to do now
[1919.60 - 1922.56] well let me look in these supplements
[1920.96 - 1923.28] let me look at the protocols let me look
[1922.56 - 1926.08] at the different
[1923.28 - 1927.12] the supplementations of where to start
[1926.08 - 1929.04] and

[2359.92 - 2363.12] how much they can get out of there but
[2361.28 - 2364.64] they take all of our bond they they
[2363.12 - 2366.88] basically do over time

[2386.24 - 2390.16] life out of you without realizing it's
[2388.32 - 2391.52] the system itself it's broken i talk

[2416.24 - 2419.92] from certain health issues it has
[2417.84 - 2421.28] several applications most notably for
[2419.92 - 2423.92] gut healing and food

[2427.44 - 2430.88] okay so exactly so motto eating saved my
[2429.92 - 2433.36] own life
[2430.88 - 2434.88] you guys because from food poisoning
[2433.36 - 2435.52] because food poisoning kills a lot of
[2434.88 - 2438.16] people

[2438.16 - 2440.72] of people down just letting you know i'm
[2439.60 - 2443.84] going to cleanse the heel now
[2440.72 - 2447.28] a little bit uh the mono-eating
[2443.84 - 2449.68] so go into that too a little bit
[2447.28 - 2451.36] figuring out what to eat figure out what
[2449.68 - 2452.32] to eat when you're challenged with a
[2451.36 - 2454.96] digestive
[2452.32 - 2456.88] system problem can feel impossible and
[2454.96 - 2458.56] this really helps clear that
[2456.88 - 2460.72] field that playing field so you can
[2458.56 - 2462.80] learn right so gastroparesis
[2460.72 - 2464.56] undiagnosed gut problems if you're in
[2462.80 - 2465.84] that like
[2464.56 - 2467.28] what's going to happen here's the gut
[2465.84 - 2468.32] health world the gut health world is
[2467.28 - 2470.96] going to be like
[2468.32 - 2472.24] all-encompassing right every single
[2470.96 - 2474.16] functional medicine doctor
[2472.24 - 2476.08] every single doctor you guys go to every
[2474.16 - 2477.44] single doctor everybody goes to it's all
[2476.08 - 2478.56] going to be about gut health take these
[2477.44 - 2480.48] probiotics
[2478.56 - 2481.84] let's do some stool samples let's look
[2480.48 - 2483.52] for parasites let's
[2481.84 - 2485.28] look for this let's look for that so
[2483.52 - 2487.20] it's all going to be about gut health
[2485.28 - 2490.00] from here on out right
[2487.20 - 2490.96] but it doesn't mean that's the answer or
[2490.00 - 2493.52] it doesn't mean
[2490.96 - 2494.08] the remedies are going to be the answers
[2493.52 - 2495.76] because
[2494.08 - 2497.68] they've been focused on gut health
[2495.76 - 2499.28] anyway alternative medicine's been
[2497.68 - 2501.60] focused on gut health going back now
[2499.28 - 2504.48] decades with the whole candida
[2501.60 - 2506.08] farce so we're kind of still stuck in
[2504.48 - 2507.52] that gut health world which is gut
[2506.08 - 2508.00] health gut health gut health and that's
[2507.52 - 2510.80] the problem
[2508.00 - 2512.24] and it's got health um and so yeah and
[2510.80 - 2515.04] guess what our guts become
[2512.24 - 2516.00] a mess absolutely a hundred percent and
[2515.04 - 2517.68] there's no doubt
[2516.00 - 2518.96] we get bacteria in our gut we get
[2517.68 - 2520.64] inflammation in our gut because of
[2518.96 - 2522.00] bacteria and viruses in our gut we get
[2520.64 - 2523.52] all kinds of problems in our gut medical
[2522.00 - 2524.24] medium information's always been about
[2523.52 - 2526.64] that right
[2524.24 - 2527.76] but how do we really fix it so you're
[2526.64 - 2530.88] not doing harsh
[2527.76 - 2533.92] gut cleansers and gut tonics
[2530.88 - 2536.56] and gut powders and
[2533.92 - 2538.24] probiotic you know probiotics and
[2536.56 - 2540.16] everything else and not still
[2538.24 - 2541.92] moving forward to where you need to go
[2540.16 - 2544.16] like how do we address that
[2541.92 - 2546.00] so the mono eating cleanse is a great
[2544.16 - 2548.72] way to do it for gastroparesis
[2546.00 - 2551.52] undiagnosed gut problems even diagnose
[2548.72 - 2555.20] gut problems crohn's colitis
[2551.52 - 2556.00] um elevated histamines in people's
[2555.20 - 2558.80] systems
[2556.00 - 2559.92] food sensitivities food allergies all of
[2558.80 - 2563.04] that ibs
[2559.92 - 2566.24] right celiac and and
[2563.04 - 2570.16] digest the bloating pain gastritis
[2566.24 - 2573.84] okay yep yep that one so all of them
[2570.16 - 2575.76] and this is a way a technique to work on
[2573.84 - 2577.28] how to heal and it talks about how to do
[2575.76 - 2580.16] that and i'll give you a quick run down
[2577.28 - 2581.68] like when it comes down to bananas right
[2580.16 - 2582.64] one thing you'll be told in alternate
[2581.68 - 2585.52] medicine
[2582.64 - 2586.96] is you know stay away from bananas too
[2585.52 - 2589.68] much sugar and that's an
[2586.96 - 2590.00] epic disaster because i've seen bananas
[2589.68 - 2593.12] take
[2590.00 - 2595.12] people from the worst conditions
[2593.12 - 2597.20] physically with all kinds of different
[2595.12 - 2599.76] diagnoses including gut problems
[2597.20 - 2601.52] i've seen bananas and leafy greens like
[2599.76 - 2603.76] bananas and romaine lettuce
[2601.52 - 2605.68] bananas and green leaf lettuce bananas
[2603.76 - 2607.60] and red leaf lettuce right
[2605.68 - 2609.20] butter leaf lettuce i've seen that take
[2607.60 - 2610.00] someone to the finish line of their
[2609.20 - 2611.76] healing
[2610.00 - 2613.36] where and i talk about that in the mono
[2611.76 - 2615.28] eating section of the book
[2613.36 - 2616.72] and in the moderating section the book
[2615.28 - 2618.48] it'll be like okay you're drinking your
[2616.72 - 2621.28] 32 ounces of celery juice
[2618.48 - 2622.08] right okay you're doing your bananas and
[2621.28 - 2624.08] your lettuce
[2622.08 - 2626.88] so and you're doing a mono version of
[2624.08 - 2628.88] that there's also a potato version too
[2626.88 - 2630.48] where in the mono eating cleanse there's
[2628.88 - 2631.28] also potatoes we're doing steamed
[2630.48 - 2635.84] potatoes
[2631.28 - 2635.84] and greens it's important
[2644.24 - 2652.24] yeah uh hello i'm here
[2649.12 - 2655.28] okay well here's what happens right
[2652.24 - 2658.32] um okay so i hear
[2655.28 - 2661.44] spirit of compassion right
[2658.32 - 2663.68] from above since i was age four okay
[2661.44 - 2666.40] and some people might find that
[2663.68 - 2668.08] difficult to understand and some people
[2666.40 - 2669.60] totally they're chill with it they're
[2668.08 - 2672.56] fine with it right
[2669.60 - 2675.76] and um but that information has helped
[2672.56 - 2678.72] millions heal around the world
[2675.76 - 2680.64] um it's hard for a lot of people because
[2678.72 - 2681.36] they don't have they're not having that

[2780.80 - 2784.24] so anyway you guys um i was talking
[2782.64 - 2784.72] about mono eating and how helpful that
[2784.24 - 2786.96] is
[2784.72 - 2788.00] so i'm giving like i'm giving you guys
[2786.96 - 2791.28] like really
[2788.00 - 2794.08] powerful information here um
[2791.28 - 2795.36] and this is why it's important about the
[2794.08 - 2798.08] details
[2795.36 - 2798.80] everybody's they're just lost out there
[2798.08 - 2801.12] they'll
[2798.80 - 2802.64] be doing something that's partially good
[2801.12 - 2804.08] for them but then they'll be
[2802.64 - 2806.16] mixing it up with something that's bad
[2804.08 - 2807.52] for them they'll talk about getting
[2806.16 - 2809.44] metals out of them
[2807.52 - 2811.20] but they'll be using corella to get the
[2809.44 - 2811.76] metals out which doesn't get the metals
[2811.20 - 2813.52] out
[2811.76 - 2815.60] they'll try to get their gut health
[2813.52 - 2816.32] better and then they'll get rid of
[2815.60 - 2818.24] gluten
[2816.32 - 2820.00] but they'll be using apple cider vinegar
[2818.24 - 2821.60] which destroys your gut
[2820.00 - 2823.36] see see where it goes this is just
[2821.60 - 2827.12] little examples okay
[2823.36 - 2830.80] right and fixing things takes
[2827.12 - 2832.64] the details all the details matter
[2830.80 - 2834.72] it all matters so it's all about the
[2832.64 - 2836.72] details so important to know and
[2834.72 - 2838.56] what a lot of people do is they'll get
[2836.72 - 2841.20] stuck with something
[2838.56 - 2842.88] that's going around and they won't know
[2841.20 - 2844.32] that it's not a good thing so they'll
[2842.88 - 2845.92] have the natural flavors they'll have
[2844.32 - 2847.52] the msg they'll be doing chocolate
[2845.92 - 2849.12] they'll be doing their nutritional yeast
[2847.52 - 2851.36] they'll be doing too many things
[2849.12 - 2852.88] and they add up and when they add up it
[2851.36 - 2853.84] stops you from healing so the good
[2852.88 - 2856.32] things you're doing
[2853.84 - 2856.88] are battling the bad things you're doing
[2856.32 - 2859.28] see
[2856.88 - 2859.92] so it's like good versus bad good versus
[2859.28 - 2862.56] evil it's
[2859.92 - 2864.40] constantly good versus evil in the diet
[2862.56 - 2865.44] good versus evil even in the supplement
[2864.40 - 2867.20] world right
[2865.44 - 2868.64] and that's what everybody gets up
[2867.20 - 2870.32] against and it makes it even harder and
[2868.64 - 2872.72] harder to work with as far as for your
[2870.32 - 2874.08] healing let's talk about the recipe
[2872.72 - 2875.68] guys i hope i'm giving you some good
[2874.08 - 2876.64] information tonight meaning like
[2875.68 - 2878.56] streamlining
[2876.64 - 2879.84] some tidbits so you guys have have that
[2878.56 - 2881.36] under your belt
[2879.84 - 2882.96] let's start making a salad i'm going to
[2881.36 - 2885.84] use some of this romaine lettuce this is
[2882.96 - 2887.84] romaine lettuce which is
[2885.84 - 2889.52] i like romaine lettuce now you can chop
[2887.84 - 2890.16] it up as fine as you want you can chop
[2889.52 - 2894.00] it up as
[2890.16 - 2896.08] is is little pieces i like chopping up
[2894.00 - 2901.84] in littler pieces for this
[2896.08 - 2901.84] so this is the apple salad
[2902.16 - 2905.84] so i'm going to get a little bit more in
[2903.60 - 2905.84] here
[2907.36 - 2916.16] move this aside for a second
[2914.40 - 2917.92] a little bit more right we got that
[2916.16 - 2921.04] going in there let's do
[2917.92 - 2923.68] a little bit of cilantro in this salad
[2921.04 - 2925.12] you guys don't mind look i'm using this
[2923.68 - 2928.16] as a leafy green
[2925.12 - 2929.68] i'm not using that much right and
[2928.16 - 2930.96] putting it on top of a piece of fish
[2929.68 - 2934.32] actually what people do
[2930.96 - 2936.48] with fish is they'll put this much
[2934.32 - 2938.56] that's your cilantro cilantro in a
[2936.48 - 2940.64] guacamole people use that much
[2938.56 - 2942.56] cilantro and guacamole right they use
[2940.64 - 2944.40] that much that's all they'll use
[2942.56 - 2945.68] look at that right or on a piece of fish
[2944.40 - 2947.12] they'll chop up that much if you're
[2945.68 - 2948.08] lucky and put it on top of a piece of
[2947.12 - 2950.32] salmon right
[2948.08 - 2951.12] we're using a leafy green medical medium
[2950.32 - 2952.64] tulle
[2951.12 - 2955.36] and i don't care what anybody says you
[2952.64 - 2957.52] guys no one used
[2955.36 - 2958.88] leafy greens until they learn the
[2957.52 - 2960.16] medical medium information out there and
[2958.88 - 2962.16] if you learned about leafy greens
[2960.16 - 2964.32] through some other source it came it was
[2962.16 - 2965.76] osmosis through another source that
[2964.32 - 2967.52] learned it from medical medium
[2965.76 - 2970.72] 35 years of teaching people about leafy
[2967.52 - 2974.24] greens people just used iceberg lettuce
[2970.72 - 2976.72] in the health realm vegan realm
[2974.24 - 2978.96] iceberg lettuce vegan realm it was
[2976.72 - 2980.24] iceberg lettuce
[2978.96 - 2983.52] yeah that was it you know the vegan
[2980.24 - 2985.36] realm was it was gluten bread
[2983.52 - 2986.72] it was bread with gluten in it and
[2985.36 - 2988.24] iceberg lettuce
[2986.72 - 2990.16] i mean that's what it was and then when
[2988.24 - 2990.80] someone got sick it was some wheatgrass
[2990.16 - 2992.88] juice
[2990.80 - 2995.04] that was it i mean it was literally just
[2992.88 - 2996.32] down to that little batch of things the
[2995.04 - 2998.08] medical medium information
[2996.32 - 2999.36] blew the roof off of all of it for all
[2998.08 - 3001.04] these years
[2999.36 - 3002.48] i have a whole episode on apple cider
[3001.04 - 3005.28] vinegar in the podcast
[3002.48 - 3006.56] indeed i do linda thank you for that i'm
[3005.28 - 3012.80] going to put some
[3006.56 - 3013.28] cilantro in the salad that's a leafy
[3012.80 - 3016.56] green
[3013.28 - 3019.20] that's using it like that that's how
[3016.56 - 3020.64] we get better it's these details there's
[3019.20 - 3022.32] so many of them the medical medium
[3020.64 - 3024.56] information
[3022.32 - 3026.16] okay so many it would blow your mind if
[3024.56 - 3028.56] you knew
[3026.16 - 3030.32] what i've done in the last 35 years who
[3028.56 - 3031.68] i've helped who i've talked to who i
[3030.32 - 3034.24] spoke to in the health realm
[3031.68 - 3035.04] who i've guided and how that information
[3034.24 - 3038.40] has crossed
[3035.04 - 3040.08] all lines all around the world
[3038.40 - 3042.16] and you know how you might be like ah
[3040.08 - 3045.20] how can that be true oh really
[3042.16 - 3047.04] how can i how come i'm the only one
[3045.20 - 3048.64] that's figured out how to save lives is
[3047.04 - 3050.48] it because i'm a genius or something
[3048.64 - 3051.76] because i'm not a genius figured out
[3050.48 - 3053.28] about the blood draw problem
[3051.76 - 3055.44] that's knocking people back left and
[3053.28 - 3057.28] right how come i'm the only one when the
[3055.44 - 3058.88] plague just came out recently
[3057.28 - 3061.36] to talk about the after effects before
[3058.88 - 3064.56] anybody uttered a word about it like
[3061.36 - 3067.36] how come i'm the only one that said
[3064.56 - 3068.72] no you use the lemon water to flush your
[3067.36 - 3070.88] liver
[3068.72 - 3072.16] flush your liver it's not because i'm a
[3070.88 - 3074.56] genius that's
[3072.16 - 3075.76] spirit of compassion right but either
[3074.56 - 3078.96] way
[3075.76 - 3081.28] you know all these tools right but
[3078.96 - 3083.84] and then they get out there and they get
[3081.28 - 3083.84] passed around
[3085.04 - 3090.16] and people just forget you know it's
[3088.00 - 3093.44] like oh
[3090.16 - 3095.12] i mean there's premier medical clinics
[3093.44 - 3096.24] using medical medium information right
[3095.12 - 3097.84] now
[3096.24 - 3099.44] no science behind it it's just coming
[3097.84 - 3102.96] from medical media
[3099.44 - 3105.12] elizabeth hey truth i see so many people
[3102.96 - 3106.96] now using a bunch of cilantro in their
[3105.12 - 3108.80] smoothies yeah but they're not saying
[3106.96 - 3110.88] medical medium right liz
[3108.80 - 3113.36] they're not saying medical medium but it
[3110.88 - 3115.84] comes from medical medium information
[3113.36 - 3117.44] it only only comes from medical medium
[3115.84 - 3119.28] information
[3117.44 - 3121.12] but then it gets it gets passed around
[3119.28 - 3123.20] right and here's the thing
[3121.12 - 3124.88] when medical medium tools get out there
[3123.20 - 3127.04] people use them and it's protecting them
[3124.88 - 3128.64] against all the bad stuff they're doing
[3127.04 - 3129.60] so there's there's this thing happening
[3128.64 - 3131.28] where they're getting some of the
[3129.60 - 3133.20] medical medium tools whatever they are
[3131.28 - 3135.12] and then they're they're battling the
[3133.20 - 3135.76] bad stuff they're doing that's out there
[3135.12 - 3138.00] right
[3135.76 - 3139.20] and you know this is how it works okay
[3138.00 - 3140.88] so let's go in just a little bit of
[3139.20 - 3143.04] making
[3140.88 - 3144.24] so i got cilantro in here i got some
[3143.04 - 3145.92] parsley you got a decent amount of
[3144.24 - 3147.52] parsley
[3145.92 - 3149.44] and it's so good when you use a lot of
[3147.52 - 3153.52] parsley right so i'm going to just chop
[3149.44 - 3156.64] up that a little bit more
