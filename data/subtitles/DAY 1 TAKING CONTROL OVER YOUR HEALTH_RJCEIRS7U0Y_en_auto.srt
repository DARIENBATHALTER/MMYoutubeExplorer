um recipe with me i'm gonna do that in a

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
little bit so

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,319
let's talk about

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,879
why we're even doing this

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,439
why even bother why are we doing this

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,120
why are we doing the anti-blood cleanse

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,879
what's the point

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
and what are we cleansing

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
what are we even doing

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
here's the first thing we're doing is

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
we're getting rid

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
of bug

117
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,560
fuel

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,359
you know how your car takes fuel your

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
car needs fuel so you can drive maybe

120
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,040
you got an electric car

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
and your car still needs fuel because

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
that battery's going to go dead so you

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
got to charge the battery

124
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
whether you have to charge the battery

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
you've got to put gasoline or you've got

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,360
to put diesel in a truck whatever it is

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
it needs fuel

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
and that's important to know right it

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,400
needs fuel well bugs need fuel

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,080
the bugs that make you sick

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,199
need fuel

132
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,600
everybody's loaded with bad

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
bugs and if you think it's a parasite

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
for some reason you've been brainwashed

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,440
in in a sense of the parasite world

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,199
right from the old parasite cleanse

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,199
thing and parasite knowledge thing then

138
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,840
fine think it's a parasite

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,000
then let's starve the parasite okay but

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,759
what's really happening is people have

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,120
bacteria they have lots of viruses

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,720
lots of viruses inside of them

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
and if you're somebody just came on here

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
and you're like what do you mean viruses

145
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,960
like what viruses what are you talking

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,919
about right fever blisters cold sores

147
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
viruses simplex herpes too right simply

148
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,600
right

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,639
boom viruses okay h pylori bacteria

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
right

151
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:38,080
and then you know of shingles virus

152
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,800
and e coli bacteria staph bacteria right

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,800
and we have all these bugs inside of us

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,479
we just do and they sit inside of a

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
strep throat maybe had strep throat at

156
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,919
one time maybe had mono at one time

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
here's the thing

158
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,039
and medical medium information brought

159
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,800
this to the world right if you had mono

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,160
so if you had mono at some time in your

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
life

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
you may not even know you had it and you

163
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,919
had it

164
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
that bug is the epstein bar and it comes

165
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,479
back later

166
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
it comes back later with fibromyalgia it

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
comes back later with chronic fatigue

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
syndrome hashimoto's thyroiditis

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
hyperthyroidism

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,639
nodule cysts tumors on the thyroid

171
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,400
that's epstein-barr rheumatoid arthritis

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,639
lyme disease all these things

173
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,319
neurological lyme are viral caused right

174
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
so it's important to know so why are we

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
doing this

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,360
we're doing this because your eczema is

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,919
viral cause your psoriasis is viral

178
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:42,240
caused okay your your skin conditions

179
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,720
viral caused vitiligo is viral caused

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
your fibrosis your lupus your multiple

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
sclerosis your als there's a lot of

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
stuff and metals play a role too i've

183
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
talked all about that for years you guys

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,120
know that but viruses play this huge

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,039
role including anxiety upping the game

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,800
with crippling anxiety

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,400
so it's metals and viruses but viruses

188

whatever level you pick you're gonna

275
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,959
kill more bugs

276
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,720
so whatever level you pick you're gonna

277
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
kill more bugs are you picking level one

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
okay

279
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,560

287
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
yourself right

288
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
but the goal

289
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
is to starve

290
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,040
the bugs

291
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,279
they go hungry

292
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
once they go hungry

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,880
they start

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,399
to implode

295
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,320

296
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:14,240

cutting up their egg slices they're

318
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
putting it in their salad and they're

319
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,680
feeding their bugs and they're

320
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
guaranteeing guaranteeing

321
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,800
a ticket

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,000
in badlands down the road

323
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
look

324
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,399
everybody gets sick we're in a different

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
world now

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,360
nobody goes the whole way through

327
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
without getting sick

328
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
and sicker and sicker

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,200
we're in a different place in a

330
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,839
different time frame in history we're in

331
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
a different world

332
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
you don't want to keep on feeding your

333
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,279
bugs you want to learn how to stop

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,519
feeding your bugs

335
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,560
that's what you want to do

336
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,920
okay

337
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,519
lactose free dairy still feeds the bugs

338
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
keep that in mind you guys a little note

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,160
right there lactose free dairy still

340
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,880
feeds the bugs the protein

341
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,800
in lactose free dairy

342
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
feeds the bugs

343
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,519
keep that in mind right there really

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,040
important to know so dairy protein will

345
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
feed the bugs

346
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
so

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,760
the goal is

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,839
to starve out and kill off the bugs

349
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
what level are you doing to do that if

350
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
you do level one that's okay you get rid

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,519
of eggs you get rid of dairy products

352
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,279
you get rid of gluten

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,600
get rid of soft drinks too you know why

354
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,279
a lot of soft drinks will have that corn

355
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,720
syrup that gmo corn syrup which is a bug

356
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,959
fuel

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
all right that's a grain that feeds the

358
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
bugs okay

359
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,680
and

360
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,720
you can do level one you can do that

361
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,320
right

362
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,760
and that's fine

363
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,639
level two is another level now keep in

364
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,920
mind

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,519
you take food away from the bugs

366
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
they go hungry

367
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
and they're gonna make

368
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,279
you

369
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
very

370
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,639
very

371
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,040
emotionally hungry for that food so bugs

372
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
control

373
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,279
our

374
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,079
habits

375
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,199

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
we're not on a deprivation

423
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,959
cleanse

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,120
this isn't deprivation this is eating so

425
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,279
if you guys aren't eating

426
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800

if you guys are not eating

432
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800

because this isn't about deprivation

446
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
it's not about starving you

447
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,759
it's about starving the pathogens the

448
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
bugs that's why it's the anti-blood

449
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
cleanse

450
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,160
that's why

451
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,480
how are the bugs coming out of the body

452
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,480
poop and pee

453
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
that's how they're coming out

454
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,399
poop

455
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,399
pee

456
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
that's how they come out they also come

457
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
out of here

458
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,399
when you're sleeping

459
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
they come out of the eyes

460
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
they're not crawling out of the eyes

461
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,600
that's not how they do it

462
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,639
the dead bug aparts can come out in just

463
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,480
tears

464
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,000
not when you're crying or anything but

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
you know the sandman you know the

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,639

that's how the bugs come out so it's

476
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
so

490
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,280
our livers is where a lot of the bugs

491
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,200
are happening so that's the party town

492
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,240
that's where it's happening that's party

493
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,000
zone right here party central four bugs

494
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
it's in the liver

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
different varieties of epstein-barr

496
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,200
streptococcus inside the liver hhv-6

497
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,440
hhv7 you guys you wouldn't believe how

498
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,280
many bugs people have they'll have hhv-6

499
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,559
hhv-7 they'll have two varieties of

500
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
epsom bar they'll have a shingles

501
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,320
they'll have a cytomegalovirus all

502
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
sitting inside their liver waiting to

503
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,919
give you health throughout your whole

504
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,880
life

505
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,440
and so it's in here a lot of these bugs

506
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
so here's what's happening all that food

507
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,520
you eat so if you eat an egg just let's

508
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,400
use an egg as an example right

509
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,320
if you're eating an egg

510
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
the egg goes down into your intestinal

511
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,200
tract

512
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,480
particles from that egg

513
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,280
micro particles from that egg get sucked

514
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,160
up through the hepatic portal vein into

515
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,440
your liver the hepatic portal vein is

516
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,440
attached to the intestinal tract

517
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,200
you guys there's a vein that goes from

518
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,000
the intestinal tract to the liver a vein

519
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,480
okay and what happens is those egg

520
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,320
particles get sucked up the vein and go

521
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,960
right up into the liver

522
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,799
and then the bugs feed off of the eggs

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
inside your liver so when you're having

524
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,919
your eggs

525
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,160
you're just filling your liver up with

526
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,160
egg particles and feeding the bugs

527
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
happy happy are they

528
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
right

529
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
here's what happens you start to starve

530
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,960
them you don't feed them with their used

531
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,640
to be what they're used to eating

532
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,039
the weak ones

533
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,520
die first

534
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,240
so the weak epstein bar

535
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
the weak streptococcus the weak sediment

536
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,039
virus

537
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
the weak hpv

538
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,520
the weak

539
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,760
hiv

540
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,440
these bugs start to die first and then

541
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
they shoot up

542
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,559
the bile duct out of the liver into

543
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
the gallbladder

544
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,200
and back into the intestinal tract and

545
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
then you poop them out

546
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,799
you don't hear that at the doctor's

547
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
office do you

548
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,400
you don't hear that at the alternative

549
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
people's offices you don't hear that in

550
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,559
anybody's books you don't hear that

551
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,640
anywhere it's all mm info it's why

552
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,799
people heal

553
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,799
so

554
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,559
the bugs aren't coming out through your

555
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,799
sweat

556
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,200
keep that in mind

557
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,520
they come out through other passageways

558
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
they have to be direct like your

559
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,240
nostrils

560
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,880
they come out through your eyes

561
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,559
they can come out sometimes

562
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,120
through the ears

563
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,039

these cleanses or if you don't have it

581
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,559
now get one critical okay

582
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,559
16.99 amazon.com us it's on sale i call

583
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,320
it divine intervention angelic

584
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,480
intervention because they priced the

585
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,320
book for some reason

586
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,159
and you know what it's possibly priced

587
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,760
at this low to actually try to hurt me

588
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
or something right because there's so

589
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,120
much discrimination against medical

590
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
meaning for a lot of reasons because

591
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,039
being the number one health author in

592
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
the world for almost seven years running

593
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,720
has gotten so many people mad it's

594
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
ridiculous right because because people

595
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,480
heal that's why

596
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,240
and and that's why the books have been

597
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,720
out there because so many people healed

598
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,880
but they lowered the price

599
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
on this book i call it like divine

600
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
intervention

601
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
um

602
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
probably thinking they'll just hurt my

603
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,559
pocket or something like hey he won't

604
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,559
get his 10 cents we're gonna make sure

605
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,679
that we under price it so he doesn't

606
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
live

607
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,120
and can't pay the light bill but the

608
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
point is

609
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,480
is what's incredible about it because it

610
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,120
costs way more to print what's

611
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,679
incredible about them doing that right

612
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,840

686
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:57,000
you're not eating something healthy when

687
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,000

690
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,080
when you have sushi

apple juice right

696
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,440
and i think it's starting to kick in

697
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,200
all right

698
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,279
you're not eating healthy with sushi

699
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
it's loaded with vinegar

700
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,559

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,120
you can get some you can get some bugs

702
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,840
it's loaded with mercury

703
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,480
so that's okay corn

704
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,360
corn keep the corn out

705
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,120

709
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,159

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,080
right

711
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
it's gmo all of it even the organic

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,720
stuff keep it out

713
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
so that's level two level two is what we

714
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,360
talked about eggs dairy gluten soft

715
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,679
drinks and now tuna pork corn that's

716
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,760
level two you guys doing level three

717
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,679
who's doing no nachos question mark

718
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
yeah if you want to do level two no not

719
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,320
you nachos but if you do level one you

720
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,320
can do nachos

721
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,679
yeah if you do level one if you do level

722
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,120
one where you just take out the eggs the

723
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
dairy and everything then you probably

724
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,240
could

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,039
it's still gonna feed some bugs oh wait

726
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,039
wait

727
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,400
your nachos might have cheese on it no

728
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,880
you can't do nachos

729
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,880
not even on level one

730
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,520
there goes that no nachos out the window

731
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,400
level three who's doing level three this

732
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,279
is when now you get rid of industrial

733
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,240
food oils

734
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,159
vegetable oil palm oil canola oil corn

735
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,720
oil safflower oil soybean oil you get

736
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:08,080
rid of soy and you get rid of lamb right

737
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,080
and then you get rid of lamb

738
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,960
does a lamb do that or is this a sheep

739
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,600
are they the same are they different

740
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,039
we get rid of lamb

741
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
okay

742
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,679
that's the next thing it's important get

743
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,039
rid of the lamb

744
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,440
so that's the next thing there

745
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,480
the next thing

746
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,480
fish

747
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,640

you're going to come here so brainwashed

785
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,440
i saw a comment earlier today on youtube

786
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,120
and it was something like

787
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,440
you don't know anything about fats

788
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,080
aw you know nothing about fats it's

789
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,240
omega-6s that are the bad ones and you

790
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,799
know omega-3s are critical

791
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,240
fats high-fat diets are amazing for us

792
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,200
you don't know anything about healthy

793
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
fats

794
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
you just don't get it

795
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,520
and you know when i read that i was like

796
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
okay first of all you don't get it

797
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,600
because that's vegan doctor information

798
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,440
that's outdated and antiquated

799
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,679
okay because yeah sure okay omega-6s

800
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,640
aren't the best fat but when it comes

801
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
down to

802
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
making

803
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,360
like

804
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,840
the break of health in a sense of making

805
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,600
that break in your life like getting to

806
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,440
that finish line crossing that finish

807
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,399
line like getting better from severe

808
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,360
chronic illness any fat will take you

809
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,440
down

810
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,679
and what people don't realize

811
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,480
is that the fats

812
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,399
stop your nerves your nerve cells from

813
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,919
receiving nutrients

814
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,320
that they need

815
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,880
including glucose so you can recover

816
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,679
from multiple sclerosis als chronic

817
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,159
fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia lupus and

818
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,799
so much more neurological lyme so if

819
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
you're not so sick and you you hear some

820
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
antiquated outdated information about

821
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,480
how good fats are for you and how it's

822
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,559
just the omega-6s like sunflower oil you

823
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
need to look out for you're totally

824
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,360
behind

825
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,520
this is

826
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,440
advanced information yeah if you're

827
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,200
coming from a standard american diet or

828
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,120
standard european diet you come from

829
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,279
just a junk food diet and you go and you

830
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,559
eat a healthy keto diet plant-based or

831
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,840
animal protein you're going to see

832
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,760
benefits

833
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,279
but if you're somebody who's really sick

834
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,799
and you're going down and out for the

835
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,559
count and you can't function and you

836
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,000
can't feed your kids or you can't work

837
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,520
or you can't drive your car and you're

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,320
on mattress island

839
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,360
any fat will stop you from healing

840
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
so

841
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,039
i love when someone tries to school me

842
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,799
like i don't know something they give me

843
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
outdated antiquated information some

844
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,159
from some vegan doctor that just doesn't

845
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,399

846
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,440
and where i'm going here right

849
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,440
is that

850
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,440

851
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,919

the way you want to do it i'm just

1118
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,079
showing you the recipe the way i like to

1119
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,560
do it i like the thin radishes

1120
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,560
there we go

1121
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,319
but of course you guys

1122
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,079
can make it the way you want to

1123
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
i'm gonna put a little bit more radish

1124
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,839
in mine if you guys don't mind

1125
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,280
now what i love about the radish

1126
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,160
is i talk about it life-changing foods

1127
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,760
removing toxic heavy metals it does help

1128
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,520
with removing metals

1129
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,640
i also love about the radish it's

1130
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,720
anti-bug it's anti-viral

1131
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,480
the radish is anti-bug anti-viral

1132
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,200
so

1133
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,319
anti-bacteria

1134
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,720
so ulcers people with ulcers

1135
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,560
radishes

1136
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,839
okay

1137
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,720
radishes

1138
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,960
help to knock out that bacteria you know

1139
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,319
people have bacteria all in their mouth

1140
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,480
with what about that they have the

1141
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,640
bacteria all in their mouth

1142
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,079
they're losing their teeth

1143
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,760
you know i mean the gums are getting

1144
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,040
eaten away they get the cavities but you

1145
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,119
know what happens though it's all the

1146
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,119
caffeine and the vinegar that weakens

1147
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,720
the enamel so bacteria in somebody's

1148
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,480
mouth can eat away so easily

1149
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,480
everybody gets the reckoning in the

1150
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,319
dentist chair doing the caffeine

1151
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,160
doing the caffeine for too many years

1152
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,400
they get the reckoning in the dentist

1153
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,880
chair

1154
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,040
the caffeine and the unless you're a

1155
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,720
child and you didn't do all the caffeine

1156
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,599
you just came in with severe mineral

1157
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,599
deficiencies

1158
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,920
high levels of mercury too and then that

1159
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,000
could happen but you know everybody gets

1160
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,560
the reckoning down the road too if their

1161
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,359
teeth are pretty good to start with next

1162
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,599
thing you know it down the road

1163
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,520
i'm doing some thin slices of cucumber

1164
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,920
the vinegar and the caffeine really

1165
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,240
weaken the enamel so that bacteria can

1166
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,160
start eating away what i love about the

1167
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,359
radishes i was talking about before with

1168
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,200
the radish is the radish does

1169
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,359
knock down bacteria in the mouth and

1170
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,599

should be eating cucumbers every day

1313
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,920
incredible think about that right there

1314
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,640
asparagus cleans the liver asparagus is

1315
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,280
anti-viral anti-bug it's a bug killer

1316
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,319
i'm putting lemon juice on here right

1317
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:45,440
lemon juice you got that calcium and

1318
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:48,720
that vitamin c so important really is

1319
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,119
you got the radishes radishes enter into

1320
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,680
the thyroid and start knocking out

1321
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,559
epstein-barr that's what radishes do

1322
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,960
think about that parsley feeds every

1323
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,280
cell in the body strengthens the immune

1324
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:06,119
system right you know parsley is an

1325
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,119
incredible herb so i'm mixing this up

1326
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,760
this is just this is an amazing dish

1327
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,440
right here you can eat this all day long

1328
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,200
if you want i'm gonna make a quick

1329
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,640
announcement too

1330
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,119
there we go

1331
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,880
this is the potato salad you know what's

1332
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,880
missing in here

1333
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,839
huh

1334
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,079
there's no oil in here that's missing

1335
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,559
there's no eggs in here no there's no

1336
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,079
cheese in here right that's missing what

1337
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,200
else is missing in here right no dairy

1338
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,400
no butter

1339
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,720
right

1340
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,960
and what happens is when you do this fat

1341
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,119
free healing meal

1342
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,680
that's how you allow bugs to leave your

1343
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,960
system you if you're tanking too much

1344
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,720
fat

1345
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,400
you can't even get all the bugs you want

1346
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,839
out that's why i like level three level

1347
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,400
four level five level five because when

1348
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,160
you go further down the levels

1349
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,319
you're actually allowing more bugs to

1350
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,880
get out of the system but level one

1351
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,400
starts killing off bugs too but hey how

1352
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,359
far do you want to go

1353
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,319
see you guys that meal right there

1354
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:21,359
isn't bug fuel it also doesn't thicken

1355
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,760
the blood it doesn't dehydrate the body

1356
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,520
and it doesn't contribute to toxins

1357
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,079
inside the body those are the four

1358
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,040
groups that doesn't happen with this

1359
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,119
