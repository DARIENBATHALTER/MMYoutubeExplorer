Spirit of compassion one

257
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,399
question

258
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,480
okay

259
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,519
more y my husband did a w drop blood

260
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,720
test um and it just has never been

261
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,639
working out so I wanted to ask um if the

262
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,600
if just the technology would be like the

263
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,160
right one to whenever it would be

264
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,839
possible to continue with that to

265
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,079
continue with it or um does he look at

266
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,880
the books does he look at the

267
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,639
information he does he read no he does

268
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,480
not we there's information in there you

269
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,639
have to look at your symptoms the

270
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,279
symptoms are important yeah and then you

271
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,399
take the sympoms he's doing he um

272
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,079
invented a blood test a Wonder blood

273
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,519
test like a long time ago and um oh he

274
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,680
invented a he invented it yeah so my

275
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,200
question was like if the technology that

276
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,079
he is using um like it was for Spirit of

277
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,480
compassion if the technology that he's

278
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,920
using is I'd have to look at it and

279
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,440
really see and ask a lot of questions to

280
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,880
so like because it's complicated so I

281
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,440
would have to ask continual questions so

282
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,279
maybe we can someday figure out and take

283
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,240

the past that were really good okay

1772

2542
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:03,679
ago Scott first came here many years ago

2543
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:08,000
all right sat down in this restaurant

2544
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:11,000
right here and honestly honestly just an

2545
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:15,800
amazing experience I had personally hey

2546
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:17,280
chars and you know it it still has that

2547
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:19,920
incredible

2548
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:22,360
incredible feeling to it when I step

2549
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:24,599
into it years later eer and I don't have

2550
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:27,520
that with other restaurants it's not

2551
02:14:24,599 --> 02:14:30,040
like you know things change as time goes

2552
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:32,159
on but they really really kept the

2553
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:34,119
energy here there's a soul in this

2554
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:36,639
restaurant and I can't find that in

2555
02:14:34,119 --> 02:14:40,320
other places so this has great meaning

2556
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:40,320
to me and I wanted to tell you guys

2557
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:48,960
that and with restaurants over time you

2558
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:51,079
know things happen and then when they

2559
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,599
happen you know it's not the same end

2560
02:14:51,079 --> 02:14:56,679
energy cuz it's years go by but they

2561
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:58,480
kept it strong and that soul is strong

2562
02:14:56,679 --> 02:15:01,280
and that's the kind of place that I love

2563
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:03,119
to have medical medium recipes in and

2564
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:06,719

insane Cafe Gratitude has a question of

2629
02:18:07,399 --> 02:18:12,080
the day the question is what are you

2630
02:18:09,719 --> 02:18:14,800
grateful for right I don't know if you

2631
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:17,160
want to take the

2632
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,240
mic well to to give a little bit of a

2633
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:20,800
context we founded Cafe Gratitude

2634
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:22,960
Matthew and tury Englehart found a cafe

2635
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:25,840
gratitude in 2004 so this is our 20th

2636
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:28,120
anniversary this is one of

2637
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:29,960
the this is one of the initiatives that

2638
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:31,880
we are undertaking this collaboration

2639
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:34,160
with medical medium to celebrate the 20

2640
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:36,880
years and there was the original Cafe

2641
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:38,519
was founded uh around a board game that

2642
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:41,920
Matthew and trusy created maybe some of

2643
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:44,160
you know this story um a a a board game

2644
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:45,920
in abundance and gratitude so they would

2645
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,200
come into the cafe they open the cafe so

2646
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:49,519
that people could come in and play this

2647
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:51,679
board game in abundance and gratitude

2648
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:54,040
and part of what that you know the

2649
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:55,679
affirmations on the menu the question of

2650
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:57,639
the day this was all part of the

2651
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:59,080
practice of putting our attention in

2652
02:18:57,639 --> 02:19:00,760
gratitude which I know you as a

2653
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,160
community this is probably why you're

2654
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:05,040
finding your home here and there's a

2655
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:06,760
resonance here right so as I said

2656
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:08,479
earlier we do ask a question of the day

2657
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:10,080
to every customer that comes in the door

2658
02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:11,280
we ask it internally to each other at

2659
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:13,319
the beginning of our days at the

2660
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,760
beginning of our shifts um for many

2661
02:19:13,319 --> 02:19:16,840
years it was what are you grateful for

2662
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:18,840
um and that's what it's going to be

2663
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:20,240
tonight so you might I invite you to

2664
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:22,240
share with the person next to you what

2665
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:24,080
you might be grateful for today but we

2666
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:25,679
do change it every day so and it it's

2667
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,240
really just the question of the day is

2668
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:28,920
really there to put your attention on

2669
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,519
gratitude and abundance so that's what

2670
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:31,719

2902
02:52:23,239 --> 02:52:27,800
Anthony Williams uh really changed my

2903
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:30,880
life I had this um rare condition in my

2904
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:32,960
knee called pbns and um basically a

2905
02:52:30,880 --> 02:52:35,319
doctor said oh you have to keep getting

2906
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:37,000
surgeries and that's the only way to

2907
02:52:35,319 --> 02:52:40,760
heal it I was like there's got to be

2908
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:43,279
something more than that right and so

2909
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:45,960
just to condense a story in like 202s

2910
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:49,040
basically um I started reading his books

2911
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:51,160
right in 2020 and um

2912
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:54,000
I was like oh it's viral I said that's

2913
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:55,279
what it is you know and so I was

2914
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,960
supposed to have like my fourth knee

2915
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:59,239
surgery like a year and a half ago but

2916
02:52:56,960 --> 02:53:01,720
because of his information the condition

2917
02:52:59,239 --> 02:53:03,680
in my knee you know like it even after

2918
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:06,120
three knee surgeries like they're like

2919
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:08,600
it's not spreading anymore right like

2920
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:10,399
and um so it's he's completely changed

2921
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:13,080
my life to be able to continue to walk

2922
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:14,760

even the presentation of everything was

2943
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:06,720
so thoughtful and beautiful um my

2944
02:54:04,319 --> 02:54:08,399
favorite thing was the sushi actually

2945
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:09,560
and I'm looking at this and I'm like oh

2946
02:54:08,399 --> 02:54:11,479
I'm going to take this home and I'm

2947
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:14,600
going to recreate this and I'm realizing

2948
02:54:11,479 --> 02:54:18,760
that this is going to take me days like

2949
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:21,399
days to make one sushi roll like to

2950
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:23,800
marinate the pumpkin seeds and soak them

2951
02:54:21,399 --> 02:54:25,960
overnight and then make the tofu and

2952
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:29,279
then let the tofu set up overnight like

2953
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:32,279
I mean this is like days of prep you

2954
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:35,080
know so you used to be a chef I worked

2955
02:54:32,279 --> 02:54:38,160
as a chef for N9 years in South Florida

2956
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:40,960
yeah so I I really connected with with

2957
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:43,080
Chef Drew on that and I I have a lot of

2958
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:45,080
respect for anyone who does this for a

2959
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:47,200
living it's really a lot of work it's a

2960
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:49,279
labor of love and to even do like

2961
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:51,640
healing food like this

2962
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:54,080
is just it's on another level it's

2963
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:56,439
incredible and I have to say like when

2964
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:59,920
you get into medical medium and you

2965
02:54:56,439 --> 02:55:01,960
start cooking without oil and without

2966
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:03,600
like Butters and all these things it

2967
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:05,640
completely changes everything it's like

2968
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:07,720
you have to learn how to cook all over

2969
02:55:05,640 --> 02:55:09,000
again because nothing comes out the same

2970
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:11,319
when you're not cooking with tons of

2971
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:14,960
salt and tons of oils and Butters and

2972
02:55:11,319 --> 02:55:19,200
things like that so for this to be this

2973
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:22,479
good it really is an Testament to

2974
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:25,080

2978
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,279

this evening oh pretty wonderful I've

3061
02:58:44,239 --> 02:58:48,319
been thinking that it's been a long time

3062
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:50,760
since I've been in a restaurant where we

3063
02:58:48,319 --> 02:58:54,200
could both eat the same thing and I

3064
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:56,840
could have a full meal is pretty fun and

3065
02:58:54,200 --> 02:59:00,920
so you came together then yes my husband

3066
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:03,000
oh so I toate you thank you yeah so we

3067
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:05,640
don't get to sit down in a restaurant

3068
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:08,200
together almost ever yeah used to do it

3069
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:09,680
a lot yeah so this is a great treat that

3070
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:12,720
and that's why when she first heard

3071
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:15,319
about this she was immediately excited

3072
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:18,279
because it it's it becomes a restaurant

3073
02:59:15,319 --> 02:59:20,359
where she can quit wearing anything on

3074
02:59:18,279 --> 02:59:22,920

youy

3300
03:22:10,439 --> 03:22:16,920
so you guys one thing that Spirit of

3301
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:19,640
compassion always tells me is that time

3302
03:22:16,920 --> 03:22:23,160
is one of the things that so much of us

3303
03:22:19,640 --> 03:22:24,199
on planet Earth are stuck worrying about

3304
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:29,000
it's

3305
03:22:24,199 --> 03:22:33,439
time and seems to have a law over our

3306
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:36,319
heads every day time for this time for

3307
03:22:33,439 --> 03:22:39,560
that chasing our

3308
03:22:36,319 --> 03:22:43,439
taals time just rules

3309
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:45,199
everything and the one thing though

3310
03:22:43,439 --> 03:22:46,640
about time that's interesting and I just

3311
03:22:45,199 --> 03:22:49,720
want to start with this is when you

3312
03:22:46,640 --> 03:22:51,520
first get sick do you guys remember the

3313
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:54,160
first time you got sick the first time

3314
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:55,680
you got a symptom you remember remember

3315
03:22:54,160 --> 03:22:58,439
what year it

3316
03:22:55,680 --> 03:23:02,760
was maybe what month it

3317
03:22:58,439 --> 03:23:06,319
was some people what day it was it was

3318
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:09,279
October this you know was this

3319
03:23:06,319 --> 03:23:10,120
day that's how much time means so much

3320
03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:13,680
to

3321
03:23:10,120 --> 03:23:16,040
us that's how much it governs us as well

3322
03:23:13,680 --> 03:23:18,319
we remember things just like when we

3323
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:19,199
were SI

3324
03:23:18,319 --> 03:23:21,040
and

3325
03:23:19,199 --> 03:23:22,840
then there's something really

3326
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:25,640
interesting about the medical meme

3327
03:23:22,840 --> 03:23:27,880
information and it really doesn't have

3328
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:30,199
that law over its head Spirit of

3329
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:31,960
compassion has always told me that the

3330
03:23:30,199 --> 03:23:35,160
medical medium information because it

3331
03:23:31,960 --> 03:23:37,520
comes from above it doesn't come from me

3332
03:23:35,160 --> 03:23:37,520
it's

3333
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:41,680
Timeless there's something to say about

3334
03:23:40,160 --> 03:23:43,560
that because there's so many things out

3335
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:47,120
there like biohacks and Trends and

3336
03:23:43,560 --> 03:23:50,479
everything else it's not timeless

3337
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:53,199
it screws people up it hurts them it

3338
03:23:50,479 --> 03:23:55,720
throws them in different

3339
03:23:53,199 --> 03:23:59,199
directions but it's not

3340
03:23:55,720 --> 03:24:01,600
Timeless it's not

3341
03:23:59,199 --> 03:24:05,199
Timeless and so the medical medium

3342
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:07,439
information from above is timeless and

3343
03:24:05,199 --> 03:24:09,080
that brings me to the next thing I

3344
03:24:07,439 --> 03:24:12,319
wanted to tell you

3345
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:14,279
guys is about our soul are you guys

3346
03:24:12,319 --> 03:24:16,230
ready to talk a little bit about our

3347
03:24:14,279 --> 03:24:21,000
soul

3348
03:24:16,230 --> 03:24:24,000
[Applause]

3349
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:27,160
so because we're under the law of time

3350
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:29,920
here on planet Earth and it brings about

3351
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:32,520
so much stress because it does got to

3352
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:34,479
get to work on time you got to call

3353
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:36,080
somebody on time everything has to be on

3354
03:24:34,479 --> 03:24:39,600
time so we're governed by that and it's

3355
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:42,800
very stressful and difficult but our

3356
03:24:39,600 --> 03:24:46,840
souls it's a different story our souls

3357
03:24:42,800 --> 03:24:49,920
don't really see time the same

3358
03:24:46,840 --> 03:24:53,560
they just don't in fact when we leave

3359
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:56,800
here someday whether it's 100 years 50

3360
03:24:53,560 --> 03:25:00,080
years whatever it is and we leave here

3361
03:24:56,800 --> 03:25:04,359
our soul is free from time itself and it

3362
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:06,640
floats through space and time it

3363
03:25:04,359 --> 03:25:08,960
travels from this Earth through the

3364
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:14,040
solar system it's not governed by any

3365
03:25:08,960 --> 03:25:16,880
time at all and it's free and it lives

3366
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:20,080
forever I think that a lot of people

3367
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:23,880
people what holds them back is feeling

3368
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:26,399
like they're trapped under the law of

3369
03:25:23,880 --> 03:25:29,239
time they don't they don't think that

3370
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:32,399
they're ever going to have another

3371
03:25:29,239 --> 03:25:35,040
chance but that's not true that's not

3372
03:25:32,399 --> 03:25:36,600
true and I think one part of how we heal

3373
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:40,960
is to

3374
03:25:36,600 --> 03:25:43,880
know these very laws to understand this

3375
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:47,920
a little bit it's a big part of healing

3376
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:49,880
it's critical the angels don't actually

3377
03:25:47,920 --> 03:25:52,920
get governed by time

3378
03:25:49,880 --> 03:25:56,080
either they're not under that rule or

3379
03:25:52,920 --> 03:26:00,560
that law but we can access them anytime

3380
03:25:56,080 --> 03:26:03,199
we want we can they're at our fingertips

3381
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:05,399
if we need them they're there for us how

3382
03:26:03,199 --> 03:26:08,600
many of you guys are accessing angels

3383
03:26:05,399 --> 03:26:11,199
are any of you guys trying to do

3384
03:26:08,600 --> 03:26:14,840
that are you guys talking angels do you

3385
03:26:11,199 --> 03:26:14,840
talk to angels at night before

3386
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:20,160
bed it's a powerful connection that

3387
03:26:17,439 --> 03:26:22,680
everybody has the god-given right to do

3388
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:27,840
is to access the Angels talk to the

3389
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:31,840
angels use them to help you battle

3390
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:34,319
time because the angels

3391
03:26:31,840 --> 03:26:37,000
can when we're going through life and

3392
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:41,199
we're chasing our tails and we're lost

3393
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:43,479
and confused we have tools that we can

3394
03:26:41,199 --> 03:26:44,840
have access to and we do have access to

3395
03:26:43,479 --> 03:26:47,279
every single day and one is the

3396
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:48,800
connection to the angels the other is

3397
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:52,479
understanding that our soul lives

3398
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:54,880
forever no matter what I think a lot of

3399
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:57,720
people think that this is the only shot

3400
03:26:54,880 --> 03:27:00,239
you got down here and it's not your only

3401
03:26:57,720 --> 03:27:02,680
shot you live forever all the

3402
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:07,520
information you gather and Learn and

3403
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:10,279
Grow from stays in our soul it travels

3404
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:13,199
far and wide in the future 100 years

3405
03:27:10,279 --> 03:27:15,479
from now it's these very things that can

3406
03:27:13,199 --> 03:27:18,040
give you some peace while you're healing

3407
03:27:15,479 --> 03:27:20,800
your physical body body here now and

3408
03:27:18,040 --> 03:27:22,760
that's critical having peace while

3409
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:25,279
you're healing how many of you struggled

3410
03:27:22,760 --> 03:27:28,600
with not having the peace while

3411
03:27:25,279 --> 03:27:30,399
healing did you ever have that battle

3412
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:32,520
you're trying to heal but this is in

3413
03:27:30,399 --> 03:27:34,239
your way you're trying to heal but

3414
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:36,840
that's in your way you're trying to heal

3415
03:27:34,239 --> 03:27:38,160
but you don't really know how you're up

3416
03:27:36,840 --> 03:27:42,040
against so

3417
03:27:38,160 --> 03:27:44,359
much right so it's critical to get

3418
03:27:42,040 --> 03:27:46,439
moments of peace in our life while we're

3419
03:27:44,359 --> 03:27:49,040
healing

3420
03:27:46,439 --> 03:27:51,199
and we have that it's in our hands we

3421
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:53,160
can gather that piece and part of it is

3422
03:27:51,199 --> 03:27:54,600
the information that comes above have

3423
03:27:53,160 --> 03:27:57,680

information from s

3425
03:28:02,239 --> 03:28:05,840
so I know it feels like this you know

3426
03:28:04,720 --> 03:28:08,279
we're on a

3427
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:11,680
ship and we're out at

3428
03:28:08,279 --> 03:28:13,040
Sea and we're floating out there and

3429
03:28:11,680 --> 03:28:16,920
floating out

3430
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:20,840
there and we're on the sea of confusion

3431
03:28:16,920 --> 03:28:24,080
any of you remember the Sea of confusion

3432
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:25,720
right and that sea of confusion can be a

3433
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:28,080
long time for a lot of you guys with

3434
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:29,720
chronic illness how many of you guys

3435
03:28:28,080 --> 03:28:32,160
have been out in that sea before you

3436
03:28:29,720 --> 03:28:34,120
found this information from above you've

3437
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:35,640
been out there you know what it's like

3438
03:28:34,120 --> 03:28:37,840
to be lost at

3439
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:41,760
sea it's it's

3440
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:44,840
real that's real and you find this

3441
03:28:41,760 --> 03:28:47,279
information from above and then you're

3442
03:28:44,840 --> 03:28:50,199
freed from that sea of

3443
03:28:47,279 --> 03:28:54,120
confusion and that's

3444
03:28:50,199 --> 03:28:58,920
powerful keep in mind that your body's

3445
03:28:54,120 --> 03:29:00,720
healing every day I know some of you get

3446
03:28:58,920 --> 03:29:03,319
kind of lost with that and you don't

3447
03:29:00,720 --> 03:29:05,960
think you're healing anymore I know that

3448
03:29:03,319 --> 03:29:09,920
can creep up that's how it works here

3449
03:29:05,960 --> 03:29:12,319
fears creep up concerns creep up and

3450
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:14,319
then we think we're not healing but your

3451
03:29:12,319 --> 03:29:16,439
body is healing it's healing every

3452
03:29:14,319 --> 03:29:18,960
single day and all you have to do is

3453
03:29:16,439 --> 03:29:21,560
just apply one thing one thing that's

3454
03:29:18,960 --> 03:29:24,439
the information of the medical medium

3455
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:26,920
information you apply one thing and it's

3456
03:29:24,439 --> 03:29:28,800
life- changing for your body life

3457
03:29:26,920 --> 03:29:30,600
changing for your body just one thing

3458
03:29:28,800 --> 03:29:32,920
just the wild blueberry every single day

3459
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:35,359
it's one thing right just a celery juice

3460
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:37,319
it's one thing but just one thing and

3461
03:29:35,359 --> 03:29:41,439
things are changing inside the

3462
03:29:37,319 --> 03:29:44,399
body they are you can find peace in that

3463
03:29:41,439 --> 03:29:47,239
if you do one thing you find peace in

3464
03:29:44,399 --> 03:29:50,239
that if you need to access an angel you

3465
03:29:47,239 --> 03:29:52,239
can find peace in that so I wanted to

3466
03:29:50,239 --> 03:29:54,000
talk a little bit about this because so

3467
03:29:52,239 --> 03:29:55,800
many people struggle with this how many

3468
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:57,760
people do you know in your life that are

3469
03:29:55,800 --> 03:29:59,920
struggling do you know anybody in your

3470
03:29:57,760 --> 03:30:02,120
life that's struggling and you care

3471
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:04,800
about them you love them you're worried

3472
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:07,760
about them and they're struggling

3473
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:11,160
somebody in your life you know

3474
03:30:07,760 --> 03:30:13,640
somebody right and they're struggling

3475
03:30:11,160 --> 03:30:16,319
with what trying to have peace is that

3476
03:30:13,640 --> 03:30:18,279
what it is peace in their hearts peace

3477
03:30:16,319 --> 03:30:22,680
in their mind peace in their

3478
03:30:18,279 --> 03:30:24,439
head okay and so I want you to know that

3479
03:30:22,680 --> 03:30:26,560
if you need to get this information to

3480
03:30:24,439 --> 03:30:29,520
them and say look you can find peace

3481
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:31,439
it's there you just need to know your

3482
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:33,479
body's healing no matter what it will

3483
03:30:31,439 --> 03:30:35,720
heal just give it something and it will

3484
03:30:33,479 --> 03:30:38,359
heal sure it might might take a little

3485
03:30:35,720 --> 03:30:40,840
while for some somebody might take some

3486
03:30:38,359 --> 03:30:44,720
time for some people but it can heal and

3487
03:30:40,840 --> 03:30:47,600
it will heal over time and letting them

3488
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:49,880
know and the other thing is having the

3489
03:30:47,600 --> 03:30:51,160
faith how many people you know struggle

3490
03:30:49,880 --> 03:30:54,399
with faith do you know anybody that

3491
03:30:51,160 --> 03:30:57,000
struggles with faith you guys you do

3492
03:30:54,399 --> 03:30:58,479
it's a difficult one right there it's a

3493
03:30:57,000 --> 03:31:01,199
difficult one because this world kind of

3494
03:30:58,479 --> 03:31:03,479
sucks it out of you sucks it away from

3495
03:31:01,199 --> 03:31:05,800
you it beats you down and it takes away

3496
03:31:03,479 --> 03:31:07,920
our faith that's what this world is like

3497
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:11,199
right that's what it

3498
03:31:07,920 --> 03:31:13,680
does but that's okay because we can

3499
03:31:11,199 --> 03:31:15,479
build that back up we can build it up

3500
03:31:13,680 --> 03:31:20,199
and build it up a little bit each day

3501
03:31:15,479 --> 03:31:20,199
and a little bit each day I tell

3502
03:31:20,399 --> 03:31:27,000
people that look for therapies all the

3503
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:29,120
time they're looking for therapies of

3504
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:31,359
the mind they're looking for help

3505
03:31:29,120 --> 03:31:36,080
through the mind and they're visiting

3506
03:31:31,359 --> 03:31:37,840
their old old baggage of yester year and

3507
03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:40,160
they're clinging on to it and clinging

3508
03:31:37,840 --> 03:31:42,120
on to it and it's holding them down

3509
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:44,080
every day how many people have a little

3510
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:47,840
bit of that you you think something's

3511
03:31:44,080 --> 03:31:47,840
holding you back from the past

3512
03:31:48,199 --> 03:31:54,000
that's something that takes our peace

3513
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:55,920
away as well and we can cut that line

3514
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:57,800
that's holding back all that baggage

3515
03:31:55,920 --> 03:32:01,120
that's keeping it attached to us we can

3516
03:31:57,800 --> 03:32:03,960
cut that fishing line we can let it go

3517
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:06,359
and that's another form of Peace we can

3518
03:32:03,960 --> 03:32:08,120
get and what you'll find out there when

3519
03:32:06,359 --> 03:32:10,439
you really break it break it down and

3520
03:32:08,120 --> 03:32:13,120
you talk to somebody they're missing

3521
03:32:10,439 --> 03:32:15,479
that peace they're missing that Faith

3522
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:18,160
they're missing something they don't

3523
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:20,399
have that strength or that belief that

3524
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:23,040
they can talk to an angel they're not

3525
03:32:20,399 --> 03:32:24,920
sure about any information working it's

3526
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:27,720
hard to get them to understand say

3527
03:32:24,920 --> 03:32:27,720
medical medium

3528
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:34,000
information but all this can change but

3529
03:32:31,199 --> 03:32:36,239
you guys have already come this far

3530
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:38,439
you've already gone through all this you

3531
03:32:36,239 --> 03:32:41,120
beat out the Sea of confusion you got

3532
03:32:38,439 --> 03:32:43,239
away from there you got off that

3533
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:46,560
ocean you know medical medium

3534
03:32:43,239 --> 03:32:50,000
information is classic and timeless

3535
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:52,000
it's timeless it is it's here for you

3536
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:54,239
today it's here for you tomorrow it's

3537
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:56,640
here for somebody a year from now 10

3538
03:32:54,239 --> 03:32:58,439
years from now a 100 years from now it's

3539
03:32:56,640 --> 03:33:00,920
here for them and it's always going to

3540
03:32:58,439 --> 03:33:03,080
beat out the other stuff out there that

3541
03:33:00,920 --> 03:33:05,840
keeps on recycling all over again and

3542
03:33:03,080 --> 03:33:09,680
all over again because this will always

3543
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:09,680
be here because it came from

3544
03:33:10,600 --> 03:33:15,960
above and the other thing is being hard

3545
03:33:13,160 --> 03:33:19,319
on yourself too I notice

3546
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:21,080
that today right here everybody coming

3547
03:33:19,319 --> 03:33:22,479
in a lot of people are hard on

3548
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:25,080
themselves Spirit of compassion was

3549
03:33:22,479 --> 03:33:27,120
telling me this person's hard on

3550
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:29,160
themselves this person is hard on

3551
03:33:27,120 --> 03:33:32,080
themselves they think they're a bad

3552
03:33:29,160 --> 03:33:34,479
person they have a lot of fears have a

3553
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:38,279
lot of worries all these

3554
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:39,920
things and we don't have to have that

3555
03:33:38,279 --> 03:33:41,840
because you're a good person you didn't

3556
03:33:39,920 --> 03:33:43,439
do anything wrong you're a good person

3557
03:33:41,840 --> 03:33:45,800
you didn't do anything wrong you didn't

3558
03:33:43,439 --> 03:33:47,439
create your illness you're not the

3559
03:33:45,800 --> 03:33:49,000
reason why you got sick you're not the

3560
03:33:47,439 --> 03:33:51,920
reason why you're sick now and still

3561
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:54,560
struggling you're not it's not your

3562
03:33:51,920 --> 03:33:57,239
fault but we tend to kind of believe

3563
03:33:54,560 --> 03:33:58,359
that somehow and carry that and then

3564
03:33:57,239 --> 03:34:00,600
punish

3565
03:33:58,359 --> 03:34:02,319
ourselves and we have to learn to let

3566
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:04,120
that go too now I've heard that saying

3567
03:34:02,319 --> 03:34:05,800
let it go and it's really insulting it's

3568
03:34:04,120 --> 03:34:08,279
like just let it go how many times have

3569
03:34:05,800 --> 03:34:09,760
you heard that out there just let it go

3570
03:34:08,279 --> 03:34:13,319
just let it go

3571
03:34:09,760 --> 03:34:15,239
right yeah you can't let something go if

3572
03:34:13,319 --> 03:34:18,479
you don't understand it you can't let

3573
03:34:15,239 --> 03:34:21,680
something go if you just don't have

3574
03:34:18,479 --> 03:34:23,439
another way to do it and one way to do

3575
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:25,120
it is you didn't create your illness you

3576
03:34:23,439 --> 03:34:26,800
didn't you didn't create your problem

3577
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:28,880
you're not the reason for it you didn't

3578
03:34:26,800 --> 03:34:30,600
start it you're not a bad person it's

3579
03:34:28,880 --> 03:34:31,640
not your fault you're not faulty you're

3580
03:34:30,600 --> 03:34:34,359
not

3581
03:34:31,640 --> 03:34:37,399
broken that has to be embedded in your

3582
03:34:34,359 --> 03:34:41,199
Consciousness forever in your soul and

3583
03:34:37,399 --> 03:34:43,600
you guys know this and you're doing

3584
03:34:41,199 --> 03:34:45,040
it when I was just sitting over here a

3585
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:47,199
little bit a couple minutes ago Spirit

3586
03:34:45,040 --> 03:34:50,880
of compassion was saying let them know

3587
03:34:47,199 --> 03:34:53,319
that they are good you are good doesn't

3588
03:34:50,880 --> 03:34:54,960
matter what happened in the past a lot

3589
03:34:53,319 --> 03:34:57,160
of times we beat ourselves up when we

3590
03:34:54,960 --> 03:34:59,439
get sick we beat ourselves up when we

3591
03:34:57,160 --> 03:35:01,880
get chronic illness it just happens

3592
03:34:59,439 --> 03:35:04,040
that's the way the world kind of

3593
03:35:01,880 --> 03:35:06,359
like does its

3594
03:35:04,040 --> 03:35:08,920
thing but you guys don't have to believe

3595
03:35:06,359 --> 03:35:10,239
or think that anymore you're good people

3596
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:11,600
you've been through hell and back how

3597
03:35:10,239 --> 03:35:13,319

various things for a moment kind of

3643
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:15,560
opening things up Consciousness wise

3644
03:37:13,439 --> 03:37:17,840
soulwise kind of airing some things

3645
03:37:15,560 --> 03:37:19,880
things out it's going to be a little

3646
03:37:17,840 --> 03:37:21,600
emotional and then we're going to send

3647
03:37:19,880 --> 03:37:25,880
some serious light

3648
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:25,880
down this is going to be an incredible

3649
03:37:29,920 --> 03:37:34,800
night I know that when you get sick it's

3650
03:37:32,199 --> 03:37:37,800
hard to be heard it's hard to be

3651
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:39,439
validated it is when you're somebody

3652
03:37:37,800 --> 03:37:42,439
with chronic sickness or you have a

3653
03:37:39,439 --> 03:37:44,239
symtom it's hard for that to hear that

3654
03:37:42,439 --> 03:37:45,720
validation to get that validation have

3655
03:37:44,239 --> 03:37:47,399
you struggled with that at all we're

3656
03:37:45,720 --> 03:37:51,319
getting that

3657
03:37:47,399 --> 03:37:53,199
validation right right that alone is

3658
03:37:51,319 --> 03:37:55,520
hard to deal with all on its own and

3659
03:37:53,199 --> 03:37:57,720
then being heard that's another thing

3660
03:37:55,520 --> 03:37:59,479
too the light that's coming down

3661
03:37:57,720 --> 03:38:01,600
tonight's a little

3662
03:37:59,479 --> 03:38:03,840
different it's a little different than

3663
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:05,439
the light that came down yesterday it's

3664
03:38:03,840 --> 03:38:07,600
a little different than the light that

3665
03:38:05,439 --> 03:38:08,600
came down the other day and that's what

3666
03:38:07,600 --> 03:38:10,680
I've been

3667
03:38:08,600 --> 03:38:13,399
told when I was over there on the red

3668
03:38:10,680 --> 03:38:15,880

3669
03:38:13,399 --> 03:38:19,760

3673
03:38:25,080 --> 03:38:30,520
where we are in history in the

3674
03:38:27,359 --> 03:38:32,880
moment few things that were coming down

intense and S so said tonight's a

3677
03:38:35,439 --> 03:38:42,760

night and this light blast that's right

3679
03:38:42,760 --> 03:38:46,399
is going to be different

3680
03:38:46,640 --> 03:38:50,160
many of you are going to see it I know

3681
03:38:48,600 --> 03:38:52,880

intense and your dreams are going to be

3686
03:38:58,960 --> 03:39:04,359

I brought those up so tonight kind of

3688
03:39:04,359 --> 03:39:08,279

3689
03:39:06,720 --> 03:39:11,000
dreaming about when you wake up in the

3690
03:39:08,279 --> 03:39:13,439

3692
03:39:13,439 --> 03:39:21,560

3698
03:39:31,960 --> 03:39:35,160
hit keep that in

3699
03:39:35,199 --> 03:39:41,199
mind tonight Spirit of compassion was

3700
03:39:38,359 --> 03:39:42,960
telling me that you can split the light

3701
03:39:41,199 --> 03:39:45,000
if you really need to if you want to

3702
03:39:42,960 --> 03:39:47,439
send some of it to somebody else and

3703
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:50,080
keep some yourself that's how different

3704
03:39:47,439 --> 03:39:50,080
of a night it

3705
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:55,840
is you can direct all the light to

3706
03:39:54,000 --> 03:39:59,880
somebody if you want but you can also

3707
03:39:55,840 --> 03:40:02,800
like I said split it now I've never

3708
03:39:59,880 --> 03:40:05,160
heard that before from Spirit of

3709
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:06,640
compassion so it's not like I knew this

3710
03:40:05,160 --> 03:40:08,160
for years and years and years oh you can

3711
03:40:06,640 --> 03:40:10,800
just split the light that's all you can

3712
03:40:08,160 --> 03:40:13,279
split the light this is new for

3713
03:40:10,800 --> 03:40:15,960
me but I'm always surp I still get

3714
03:40:13,279 --> 03:40:17,160
surprises I'm always surprised this is

3715
03:40:15,960 --> 03:40:20,920
how it

3716
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:23,800
works because it's not coming from me I

3717
03:40:20,920 --> 03:40:23,800
get thrown these

3718
03:40:25,080 --> 03:40:29,279
Louis but splitting the light is what's

3719
03:40:27,479 --> 03:40:31,640
happening tonight if you want to send it

3720
03:40:29,279 --> 03:40:34,640
to somebody else and also keep

3721
03:40:31,640 --> 03:40:35,399
it A lot's coming down and we're able to

3722
03:40:34,640 --> 03:40:38,160
do

3723
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:39,920
it so where do you want the light to hit

3724
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:42,319
who do you want it to hit is it somebody

3725
03:40:39,920 --> 03:40:44,439
you love is it somebody that you know is

3726
03:40:42,319 --> 03:40:46,640
it somebody that you care about is it

3727
03:40:44,439 --> 03:40:48,600
somebody that you just want to see

3728
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:51,439
recover and they need some kind of

3729
03:40:48,600 --> 03:40:55,160
ignition like a starting point some kind

3730
03:40:51,439 --> 03:40:57,720
of moment where it's ignite it it's

3731
03:40:55,160 --> 03:40:59,359
going to ignite inside of us and you can

3732
03:40:57,720 --> 03:41:01,160
send a little to somebody else if you

3733
03:40:59,359 --> 03:41:02,680
choose and you don't have to do that

3734
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:04,760
either just keep it all for yourself

3735
03:41:02,680 --> 03:41:06,960
it's perfectly fine you'll be glowing

3736
03:41:04,760 --> 03:41:08,960
for quite a while and anybody you touch

3737
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:11,600
after this point for quite a while is

3738
03:41:08,960 --> 03:41:11,600
going to feel

3739
03:41:12,760 --> 03:41:17,000
it this light's going to come out of the

3740
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:18,560
pal your hand when you do Touch Somebody

3741
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:21,319
by the way it's a piece of information

3742
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:23,040
that's important to know so anybody you

3743
03:41:21,319 --> 03:41:26,120
know and you touch them on top of the

3744
03:41:23,040 --> 03:41:28,680
head it's going to come right out of the

3745
03:41:26,120 --> 03:41:31,000
palm of your hand when you touch the top

3746
03:41:28,680 --> 03:41:31,000
of their

3747
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:36,319

be perfect but do you see them and then

3753
03:41:46,600 --> 03:41:50,040
think about what's behind those stars

03:55:37,600 --> 03:55:42,760
difference in the light tonight really

4045
03:55:39,399 --> 03:55:44,800

4046
03:55:42,760 --> 03:55:47,319
light to my soul specifically

4047
03:55:44,800 --> 03:55:50,199

4048
03:55:47,319 --> 03:55:51,239

know I was really just trying to be calm

4052
03:55:56,120 --> 03:56:02,080
the last couple times I met him I was a

4053
03:55:57,840 --> 03:56:04,800
little bit frenetic so I was just so

4054
03:56:02,080 --> 03:56:05,760
glad that I was able to be grounded and

4055
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:08,760
stay

4056
03:56:05,760 --> 03:56:10,760
calm yeah and I did request that he

4057
03:56:08,760 --> 03:56:13,040
speak about the soul tonight if he could

4058
03:56:10,760 --> 03:56:15,479
so I was just so grateful that he was

4059
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:16,800
able to honor that yeah what was it

4060
03:56:15,479 --> 03:56:18,800
about this event that made you want to

4061
03:56:16,800 --> 03:56:22,680
come here to Cafe Gratitude this

4062
03:56:18,800 --> 03:56:24,439
evening so I've been using the medical

4063
03:56:22,680 --> 03:56:27,479
medium information for 9 and a half

4064
03:56:24,439 --> 03:56:29,840
years now um and I found that

4065
03:56:27,479 --> 03:56:34,159
information in June of

4066
03:56:29,840 --> 03:56:37,680
2015 um when we were living in LA

4067
03:56:34,159 --> 03:56:39,399
and my mother-in-law was starting a

4068
03:56:37,680 --> 03:56:42,279
decline in her health toward the end of

4069
03:56:39,399 --> 03:56:45,199
her life and

4070
03:56:42,279 --> 03:56:48,479
um she ended up in a care facility just

4071
03:56:45,199 --> 03:56:52,439
about a mile east of here and it was

4072
03:56:48,479 --> 03:56:53,760
very difficult watching her will give up

4073
03:56:52,439 --> 03:56:59,359
as the months went

4074
03:56:53,760 --> 03:57:01,439
on and she lost that will to live um and

4075
03:56:59,359 --> 03:57:05,479
so we were coming to visit her at that

4076
03:57:01,439 --> 03:57:09,080
care facility every few days um toward

4077
03:57:05,479 --> 03:57:11,680
the end of her life and it was so hard

4078
03:57:09,080 --> 03:57:15,279
to watch that and witness it as her life

4079
03:57:11,680 --> 03:57:18,399
force was sort of eing away

4080
03:57:15,279 --> 03:57:20,960
um and so we were trying to implement

4081
03:57:18,399 --> 03:57:23,120
Anthony's information um and we would

4082
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:24,000
come out of that care facility feeling

4083
03:57:23,120 --> 03:57:27,680
just

4084
03:57:24,000 --> 03:57:31,439
exhausted and hungry and tired and just

4085
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:34,080
needing a place of comfort and I

4086
03:57:31,439 --> 03:57:36,920
remember finding Cafe Gratitude on the

4087
03:57:34,080 --> 03:57:39,600
phone and it was a plant-based organic

4088
03:57:36,920 --> 03:57:43,560
restaurant and so we would come here and

4089
03:57:39,600 --> 03:57:46,359
this was our refuge during that time um

4090
03:57:43,560 --> 03:57:49,840
and it really became a safe haven for us

4091
03:57:46,359 --> 03:57:52,840
during that difficult um time period and

4092
03:57:49,840 --> 03:57:55,159
she did end up passing um and she wanted

4093
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:59,000
to be buried in Southern Illinois where

4094
03:57:55,159 --> 03:58:01,640
she was from um so we ended up arranging

4095
03:57:59,000 --> 03:58:04,479
her burial and we did a road trip across

4096
03:58:01,640 --> 03:58:07,359
the country from La um and it turned out

4097
03:58:04,479 --> 03:58:09,720
it's very interesting timing um my

4098
03:58:07,359 --> 03:58:11,760
youngest brother had just moved to

4099
03:58:09,720 --> 03:58:16,080
Kansas

4100
03:58:11,760 --> 03:58:18,279
City and he had moved because he was

4101
03:58:16,080 --> 03:58:20,840
trying to escape a heroin

4102
03:58:18,279 --> 03:58:22,800
addiction and he wanted a fresh start in

4103
03:58:20,840 --> 03:58:25,720
a new

4104
03:58:22,800 --> 03:58:28,640
city and so he had only been there a

4105
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:31,279
week or two and he was desperate to find

4106
03:58:28,640 --> 03:58:36,600
a job so he could stabilize in Kansas

4107
03:58:31,279 --> 03:58:38,319
City um and keep himself sober so we

4108
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:39,760
ended up meeting up with him on our road

4109
03:58:38,319 --> 03:58:42,680
trip to go to her

4110
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:45,120
funeral and I was desperate to find a

4111
03:58:42,680 --> 03:58:48,199
place to eat and Kansas

4112
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:49,760
City and so I remember we were driving

4113
03:58:48,199 --> 03:58:51,239
into Kansas City I've never been there

4114
03:58:49,760 --> 03:58:54,880
in my life I don't know where to eat

4115
03:58:51,239 --> 03:58:56,800
it's famous for barbecue right and um

4116
03:58:54,880 --> 03:58:59,399
I'm looking at the phone and and I'm

4117
03:58:56,800 --> 03:59:01,920
like you know vegan organic restaurant

4118
03:58:59,399 --> 03:59:04,159
and the first result is Cafe

4119
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:08,560
Gratitude there's a Cafe Gratitude in

4120
03:59:04,159 --> 03:59:10,720
Kansas City really yeah wow

4121
03:59:08,560 --> 03:59:12,520
so I thought oh my God am I still

4122
03:59:10,720 --> 03:59:14,640
looking at the LA search results right I

4123
03:59:12,520 --> 03:59:16,640
was so confused but it turned out no

4124
03:59:14,640 --> 03:59:19,000
there is indeed a Cafe Gratitude in

4125
03:59:16,640 --> 03:59:23,279
Kansas city

4126
03:59:19,000 --> 03:59:25,960
so we met my brother and we said hey we

4127
03:59:23,279 --> 03:59:27,760
know you don't care about vegan food but

4128
03:59:25,960 --> 03:59:29,720
that's what we want to eat and you know

4129
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:31,800
we're taking you out to eat so you have

4130
03:59:29,720 --> 03:59:36,120
to eat at this restaurant with us and so

4131
03:59:31,800 --> 03:59:37,960
we took him there um and he loved it it

4132
03:59:36,120 --> 03:59:40,960
absolutely changed something for him the

4133
03:59:37,960 --> 03:59:42,560
approach of Cafe Gratitude and the

4134
03:59:40,960 --> 03:59:45,199
attitude and the treatment of their

4135
03:59:42,560 --> 03:59:47,319

4429
04:10:59,520 --> 04:11:04,479
radiates yeah and the light blast what

4430
04:11:02,800 --> 04:11:05,800
was that experience like for you if you

4431
04:11:04,479 --> 04:11:08,600
could describe that for everyone

4432
04:11:05,800 --> 04:11:10,279
watching you know it's it's I feel like

4433
04:11:08,600 --> 04:11:12,239
this was like the first time anyone has

4434
04:11:10,279 --> 04:11:14,080
ever experienced like the ability to

4435
04:11:12,239 --> 04:11:15,359
split the light blast

4436
04:11:14,080 --> 04:11:17,439
and like to be able to share it with

4437
04:11:15,359 --> 04:11:20,000
others and I thought that was really

4438
04:11:17,439 --> 04:11:21,359
really amazing um so yeah and this one

4439
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:22,479
he said is different from the other one

4440
04:11:21,359 --> 04:11:24,439
so I'm actually really looking forward

4441
04:11:22,479 --> 04:11:25,880
to seeing like any noticeable benefits

4442
04:11:24,439 --> 04:11:28,560
cuz I have benefited from the previous

4443
04:11:25,880 --> 04:11:30,040
light blasts oh wow so in what ways do

4444
04:11:28,560 --> 04:11:32,960
you feel you benefited from those other

4445
04:11:30,040 --> 04:11:35,520
light Bloss um so I've been doing

4446
04:11:32,960 --> 04:11:37,439
medical medium protocol since 2018 and

4447
04:11:35,520 --> 04:11:39,359
I've I've done really really I've had

4448
04:11:37,439 --> 04:11:41,520
really wonderful progress but my most

4449
04:11:39,359 --> 04:11:44,319
lingering symptoms were like PTSD

4450
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:45,920
related and there is a PTSD protocol

4451
04:11:44,319 --> 04:11:49,680
that I was working on before I got

4452
04:11:45,920 --> 04:11:52,640
pregnant and um I really felt like this

4453
04:11:49,680 --> 04:11:55,000
last event the Calabasas event um that

4454
04:11:52,640 --> 04:11:57,520
one really held my PTSD with driving

4455
04:11:55,000 --> 04:11:59,279
I've had like um previous episodes where

4456
04:11:57,520 --> 04:12:00,479
when I was really sick I almost fainted

4457
04:11:59,279 --> 04:12:03,159
at the wheel and that was really

4458
04:12:00,479 --> 04:12:06,279
traumatic for me and I since then I've

4459
04:12:03,159 --> 04:12:07,680
been like afraid to drive um on highways

4460
04:12:06,279 --> 04:12:10,560
and I still do but it's like really

4461
04:12:07,680 --> 04:12:13,319
stressful for me and um ever since that

4462
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:15,199
event I don't have that anymore and it's

4463
04:12:13,319 --> 04:12:17,760
the only thing that I can attribute to

4464
04:12:15,199 --> 04:12:19,359
that change and it's been really amazing

4465
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:21,199
wow that's incredible so let's take it

4466
04:12:19,359 --> 04:12:22,239
back a little bit to when you first

4467
04:12:21,199 --> 04:12:24,640
discovered the medical medium

4468
04:12:22,239 --> 04:12:25,720
information how that came about and what

4469
04:12:24,640 --> 04:12:27,439
symptoms you were going through and

4470
04:12:25,720 --> 04:12:28,399
you're talking about the PTSD but a

4471
04:12:27,439 --> 04:12:30,720
little bit about the other things you

4472
04:12:28,399 --> 04:12:33,720
were dealing with as well yeah so my

4473
04:12:30,720 --> 04:12:36,000
story is pretty long but um that's okay

4474
04:12:33,720 --> 04:12:38,040
so I'm I'm 34 now and I got sick when I

4475
04:12:36,000 --> 04:12:40,080
was like 22 23 I ended up getting food

4476
04:12:38,040 --> 04:12:41,239
poisoning and I was working as an ICU

4477
04:12:40,080 --> 04:12:42,640
nurse at the time I ended up getting

4478
04:12:41,239 --> 04:12:43,680
food poisoning from the hospital

4479
04:12:42,640 --> 04:12:45,720
cafeteria

4480
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:47,800
and that ended up triggering my chronic

4481
04:12:45,720 --> 04:12:50,760
illness and I started developing

4482
04:12:47,800 --> 04:12:53,399
neurological symptoms chronic fatigue um

4483
04:12:50,760 --> 04:12:55,920
fainting digestive issues

4484
04:12:53,399 --> 04:12:57,680
eccema um like vertigo a lot of

4485
04:12:55,920 --> 04:12:59,760
neurological symptoms and eventually got

4486
04:12:57,680 --> 04:13:02,319
to the point where I became bed bound

4487
04:12:59,760 --> 04:13:03,760
and then I I was sick for about six

4488
04:13:02,319 --> 04:13:04,960
years before I found medical medium

4489
04:13:03,760 --> 04:13:06,119
information I was going through all

4490
04:13:04,960 --> 04:13:07,319
these different I was trying

4491
04:13:06,119 --> 04:13:08,960
conventional medicine functional

4492
04:13:07,319 --> 04:13:11,199
medicine all these alternative remedies

4493
04:13:08,960 --> 04:13:13,399
and then in 2018 I found medical medium

4494
04:13:11,199 --> 04:13:18,279
information and then 6 months later I

4495
04:13:13,399 --> 04:13:19,600
was medication free and um yeah wow yeah

4497
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:22,399
journey I will say has not been linear

I've had lots of ups and downs and

4499
04:13:22,399 --> 04:13:25,840

4571
04:15:58,359 --> 04:16:03,199
missing out on life and um like we're

4572
04:16:01,920 --> 04:16:05,199
