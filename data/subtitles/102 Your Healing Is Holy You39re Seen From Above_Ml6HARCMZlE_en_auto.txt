[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 16.24] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 18.64] one of them.
[16.24 - 22.32] Whether you're dealing with anxiety,
[18.64 - 26.00] depression, endometriosis, acne, eczema,
[22.32 - 28.40] autoimmune, thyroid, lime, brain fog,
[26.00 - 32.32] fatigue, or any other symptom or
[28.40 - 35.12] condition, you're far from alone.
[32.32 - 39.04] Living with symptoms has become the new
[35.12 - 41.84] normal. So, no more guessing games. It's
[39.04 - 44.32] time to get answers. Welcome to the
[41.84 - 45.52] Medical Medium Podcast. I'm Anthony
[44.32 - 47.68] William.
[45.52 - 51.60] We're talking about your body's ability
[47.68 - 53.60] to heal. And you have an audience. God
[51.60 - 55.68] and the angels are watching. That's
[53.60 - 59.12] right. When we go through chronic
[55.68 - 61.60] illness, we're not really alone. When
[59.12 - 63.84] people get sick, they feel that way.
[61.60 - 66.40] Even when they have people around them,
[63.84 - 68.32] it's easy to feel lonely when you're
[66.40 - 71.04] struggling with a sickness, with a
[68.32 - 74.08] chronic illness, cuz in the end, you
[71.04 - 76.24] just focus on the symptoms. And how come
[74.08 - 78.56] everybody else out there looks like
[76.24 - 80.96] they're living their lives? They feel
[78.56 - 83.68] like they're fine. They look like
[80.96 - 85.36] they're normal. But are they? Pretty
[83.68 - 87.60] much everybody's getting sick out there
[85.36 - 89.68] and they're getting their turn. But if
[87.60 - 91.84] you're already struggling, if you
[89.68 - 94.24] already have chronic illness, keep in
[91.84 - 96.32] mind that you're spiritually strong.
[94.24 - 99.36] You're emotionally strong more than you
[96.32 - 101.68] even know. You're just being rebuilt
[99.36 - 105.20] from the bottom to the top. You're just
[101.68 - 107.36] being restored, renewed. Your body wants
[105.20 - 110.64] to heal and you're in that process of
[107.36 - 113.20] healing. In this episode, just relax,
[110.64 - 116.00] get a good comfortable spot. We got some
[113.20 - 119.16] ground to cover. Are you ready? Let's
[116.00 - 119.16] get started.
[119.20 - 123.04] A lot of people are going through it.
[121.28 - 125.92] They're going through a challenge, a
[123.04 - 128.00] health challenge. They go to a doctor.
[125.92 - 129.92] They're trying to get answers. They
[128.00 - 132.40] think they get answers and maybe they
[129.92 - 135.44] do, but yet they're still stuck with the
[132.40 - 137.76] symptom. Doesn't really go away or it
[135.44 - 140.88] comes and goes or they're better for a
[137.76 - 143.52] little while naturally just heals and
[140.88 - 146.08] then it's back but back worse than it
[143.52 - 149.20] was before. Then it's back to another
[146.08 - 151.52] doctor and another doctor. Some people
[149.20 - 153.60] see dozens of doctors throughout the
[151.52 - 156.00] course of years. There are people out
[153.60 - 158.48] there that see up to a 100 doctors,
[156.00 - 160.64] practitioners, health professionals
[158.48 - 162.96] looking for answers. Their hope is
[160.64 - 165.44] strong at first, but then it can dwindle
[162.96 - 167.52] over time. And it gets harder and harder
[165.44 - 170.08] to get out of the house, to get to
[167.52 - 172.40] appointments. No one understands unless
[170.08 - 174.72] they've been there, unless they've felt
[172.40 - 177.28] it themselves, experienced it
[174.72 - 179.76] themselves. It's not easy. There's
[177.28 - 182.08] nothing easy about getting sick. There's
[179.76 - 184.48] nothing easy about having a mystery
[182.08 - 187.60] chronic illness. There's nothing easy
[184.48 - 189.84] about pain. There's nothing easy about
[187.60 - 192.08] suffering and struggles. And then
[189.84 - 195.20] another hard part is relaying the
[192.08 - 198.16] message, relaying what you're going
[195.20 - 201.20] through. People who are sick, they don't
[198.16 - 204.48] have it easy for so many reasons and so
[201.20 - 207.44] many ways. One is expressing themselves,
[204.48 - 210.16] being able to communicate their pain,
[207.44 - 212.72] being able to talk about it, being able
[210.16 - 214.64] to tell somebody else, being able to
[212.72 - 217.76] have the confidence behind them as
[214.64 - 220.64] they're telling someone because PTSD
[217.76 - 222.96] comes along for the ride, and even OCD
[220.64 - 224.80] can come along for the ride. And then
[222.96 - 227.36] something people just don't talk about
[224.80 - 231.12] in the health field enough or at all
[227.36 - 234.08] even is that most all illnesses chronic
[231.12 - 236.48] mystery illness is neurological. There's
[234.08 - 238.72] neurological symptoms involved and
[236.48 - 242.08] neurological symptoms being involved
[238.72 - 245.68] means expressing themselves talking
[242.08 - 248.88] about the problem. Communicating is
[245.68 - 252.80] difficult because neurological symptoms
[248.88 - 255.20] lead to the inability to express the
[252.80 - 256.96] suffering someone's going through. And
[255.20 - 258.96] when somebody heals from a chronic
[256.96 - 261.92] mystery illness, a neurological
[258.96 - 265.04] condition, or any health condition, they
[261.92 - 268.00] become a treasure trove of experience, a
[265.04 - 270.64] treasure trove of knowledge. Knowledge
[268.00 - 273.52] that's much different than everyday
[270.64 - 276.80] knowledge, than everyday wisdom.
[273.52 - 279.60] wisdom that's above other wisdom.
[276.80 - 282.32] Because when you come from ground zero
[279.60 - 284.96] in your health and you rise out of the
[282.32 - 287.84] ashes, the pain and suffering is left
[284.96 - 290.56] behind. But not the experience of the
[287.84 - 293.60] pain and suffering that stays within
[290.56 - 296.72] you. It's instilled within you. It
[293.60 - 299.84] becomes a force, a holy force. And one
[296.72 - 303.52] of the reasons it becomes a holy force
[299.84 - 306.56] is because God was there all along. God
[303.52 - 310.08] was watching with every single struggle.
[306.56 - 312.72] With all your pain, all your sorrow, God
[310.08 - 316.88] was there all through it. Whether you
[312.72 - 320.56] knew or you did not know, God was by
[316.88 - 323.68] your side. God was watching over you.
[320.56 - 326.64] God was seeing you sleep at night while
[323.68 - 329.60] dreaming. God was seeing you sleep at
[326.64 - 332.08] night knowing you were struggling. God
[329.60 - 334.88] saw you wake up in the morning knowing
[332.08 - 337.44] you were sad because your symptoms were
[334.88 - 340.72] still there because your condition was
[337.44 - 343.04] still the same. God knew. And if you're
[340.72 - 346.16] somebody going through any symptoms or
[343.04 - 348.96] chronic illness or struggles now, God
[346.16 - 351.84] knows. That's why your recovery and what
[348.96 - 354.32] you're going through is holy. That's one
[351.84 - 356.80] of the reasons why it's spiritual and
[354.32 - 359.44] should never be looked down upon. Should
[356.80 - 362.56] never be disrespected. What you've gone
[359.44 - 365.92] through, your healing, your sickness,
[362.56 - 368.80] your chronic illness, your experiences,
[365.92 - 371.52] your struggles should never be frowned
[368.80 - 374.72] upon. They should never be demeaned.
[371.52 - 378.00] They should never be judged by anyone.
[374.72 - 380.40] You deserve to heal, but maybe you don't
[378.00 - 382.24] think you do. When you're sick too long,
[380.40 - 384.56] you start believing you don't deserve
[382.24 - 386.88] it. That there's a reason why you're not
[384.56 - 389.20] getting better. And that reason is
[386.88 - 392.72] you're a bad person or you did something
[389.20 - 395.12] wrong or you put yourself into this. You
[392.72 - 397.60] got yourself sick. You did all the wrong
[395.12 - 400.32] things. But that's not how it works.
[397.60 - 402.96] That's not the truth. It's easy to get
[400.32 - 405.68] conditioned here on earth believing that
[402.96 - 408.00] you don't deserve to heal, that you're
[405.68 - 410.32] supposed to be stuck that you don't
[408.00 - 412.96] deserve to get better. And the minute we
[410.32 - 416.00] get sick, the minute we get a symptom
[412.96 - 418.32] and it doesn't resolve fast, the minute
[416.00 - 420.56] we're not well, we start doubting
[418.32 - 423.28] everything. And everything means our
[420.56 - 426.08] body. We doubt our body's ability to
[423.28 - 429.76] heal. We doubt we did the right thing to
[426.08 - 432.40] heal. We doubt our own confidence. We
[429.76 - 434.80] doubt our own hope. We doubt our own
[432.40 - 437.44] faith. It's easy to believe when you
[434.80 - 439.68] have chronic illness long enough that
[437.44 - 441.84] you don't deserve to heal. And it's easy
[439.68 - 444.96] to start questioning what kind of person
[441.84 - 447.76] you are, especially that people around
[444.96 - 450.24] you are wondering why you're still sick.
[447.76 - 453.12] It happens all the time. The lack of
[450.24 - 456.08] understanding can occur around you.
[453.12 - 458.80] People don't understand what it's like
[456.08 - 461.44] to be sick unless they've been really
[458.80 - 464.00] sick themselves. Unless they've been in
[461.44 - 466.16] your shoes or in the same position of
[464.00 - 469.28] somebody who's been chronically ill for
[466.16 - 472.00] a long enough time. The truth is is that
[469.28 - 474.24] everybody at some point in their life is
[472.00 - 477.28] going to experience some form of
[474.24 - 480.40] sickness. whether it's acute, whether
[477.28 - 482.24] it's severe, whether it's mild, but
[480.40 - 483.92] long-term, but they're going to
[482.24 - 485.92] experience it. Now, if you're
[483.92 - 488.40] experiencing it now and you look outside
[485.92 - 490.80] and you see people living their lives
[488.40 - 492.72] and everybody looks like they're fine,
[490.80 - 494.32] they're driving around, they're doing
[492.72 - 496.80] things, young people look
[494.32 - 500.08] indestructible, older people are walking
[496.80 - 503.12] around, nothing's wrong. Keep in mind
[500.08 - 505.20] that they may get their turn or they may
[503.12 - 508.32] not be as healthy as they look from a
[505.20 - 511.20] distance or they seem. Some of them may
[508.32 - 513.76] be struggling like you. If you're sick
[511.20 - 515.60] now, if you're struggling with symptoms,
[513.76 - 519.04] if you got chronic illness and you're
[515.60 - 521.92] younger, you're a young person, then you
[519.04 - 524.88] got sick earlier. You earned your
[521.92 - 527.12] stripes. You're obtaining knowledge.
[524.88 - 529.36] You're growing spiritually. You're
[527.12 - 531.44] becoming a stronger soul. You're
[529.36 - 534.00] becoming a seer.
[531.44 - 537.44] You can see things other people cannot
[534.00 - 540.00] see. You got life experiences other
[537.44 - 542.96] people do not have yet. You may feel
[540.00 - 545.92] weaker physically, but you're stronger
[542.96 - 549.60] spiritually. And when the day comes that
[545.92 - 551.92] you heal, when you recover, you're going
[549.60 - 553.52] to take all of that with you. And as
[551.92 - 555.52] you're living your life, people are
[553.52 - 557.44] going to walk up to you and they're
[555.52 - 559.52] going to see it and feel it. They're not
[557.44 - 561.92] going to know what it is, but they're
[559.52 - 564.24] going to sense it that there's something
[561.92 - 567.28] different about you. And as you're
[564.24 - 570.48] standing there, God is going to be
[567.28 - 573.44] watching. An angel is going to be
[570.48 - 576.56] seeing. And they were there the whole
[573.44 - 579.04] time when you were sick. They were there
[576.56 - 582.32] throughout your entire struggle, whether
[579.04 - 585.04] you were aware of it or not, because you
[582.32 - 587.76] weren't alone when you struggled. You
[585.04 - 589.92] weren't alone when you were sick. It may
[587.76 - 592.48] have felt that way, but God and the
[589.92 - 595.92] angels knew what you were going through.
[592.48 - 598.32] They were watching, seeing your courage,
[595.92 - 600.24] admiring your strength, understanding
[598.32 - 603.20] your battle. And if you're in that
[600.24 - 606.32] battle of chronic illness now and you're
[603.20 - 609.04] not healed yet, they're watching. You
[606.32 - 611.28] have an audience and you're not alone.
[609.04 - 612.72] People think when they get sick and
[611.28 - 615.92] they're struggling and they're not
[612.72 - 619.20] getting better that they are weak. But
[615.92 - 622.56] that's not true. It's the opposite. They
[619.20 - 624.16] are strong. Really strong. The
[622.56 - 627.36] strongest.
[624.16 - 630.00] Just because they can't run 10 miles, do
[627.36 - 633.44] a backflip, lift heavy weights for 2
[630.00 - 636.56] hours, athletically compete in a sport,
[633.44 - 639.12] doesn't mean they're weak on any level.
[636.56 - 641.36] Sure, physically they're struggling,
[639.12 - 644.40] physically they're not there, but
[641.36 - 647.12] mentally they're stronger than anyone.
[644.40 - 649.12] Spiritually stronger than anyone.
[647.12 - 651.60] Because what it takes to sustain
[649.12 - 655.60] yourself when you're chronically sick is
[651.60 - 659.28] like no other. What it takes to talk to
[655.60 - 662.48] your mind, to talk to yourself, to walk
[659.28 - 664.72] yourself through it every single day is
[662.48 - 667.60] like no other. Everything gets
[664.72 - 670.40] challenged. Your confidence, your
[667.60 - 672.56] consciousness, your subconsciousness,
[670.40 - 675.52] who you are as a person, it gets
[672.56 - 677.84] deconstructed. It gets purified. And
[675.52 - 682.08] then it gets reconstructed. Before you
[677.84 - 684.32] heal or as you're healing, you rebuild
[682.08 - 686.00] your soul, your consciousness, your
[684.32 - 688.08] subconsciousness.
[686.00 - 691.84] Being in the woods for a long time can
[688.08 - 694.56] do that to a person. Reshape them in a
[691.84 - 696.88] way that's unmatched. And that person
[694.56 - 699.28] out there who's athletic or they're
[696.88 - 702.40] strong or they can exercise every single
[699.28 - 705.84] day or they're in a sport, they won't
[702.40 - 708.16] know what that is. They just won't. Just
[705.84 - 711.84] because they're free will and they're
[708.16 - 716.24] using their willpower to exercise or
[711.84 - 718.56] perform doesn't mean they're stronger in
[716.24 - 720.56] every single way than someone who's
[718.56 - 724.08] chronically sick. They're used to
[720.56 - 726.32] battling gravity, battling tiredness
[724.08 - 728.64] because of overexertion.
[726.32 - 732.24] People who are chronically sick are
[728.64 - 734.80] battling mercury, metals, pathogens,
[732.24 - 736.88] toxins. They're battling a lot of
[734.80 - 739.68] things. They're battling an inner
[736.88 - 742.96] struggle that can't be seen. Weakened
[739.68 - 746.40] nervous systems, mystery, inflammation,
[742.96 - 749.28] PTSD, OCD, things that come with
[746.40 - 751.36] illnesses. They come for the ride
[749.28 - 754.00] because it's so difficult. And the
[751.36 - 756.16] battle is every single day. And the
[754.00 - 758.64] strength they have when they're sick,
[756.16 - 762.16] the strength you have when you're
[758.64 - 764.56] chronically ill and sick, is unmatched.
[762.16 - 767.36] It's unlike any other. Over the years,
[764.56 - 769.36] I've seen athletes become ill, get
[767.36 - 770.88] chronic inflammation, brain
[769.36 - 772.96] inflammation,
[770.88 - 775.44] or some kind of other chronic illness,
[772.96 - 778.48] and it hits them hard. And they're like,
[775.44 - 780.72] "Wow, I didn't know that this kind of
[778.48 - 782.16] challenge is different than the other
[780.72 - 785.20] kind of challenge I do every day
[782.16 - 788.08] athletically. I didn't know that it
[785.20 - 791.68] takes everything I got. Everything
[788.08 - 794.08] mental, emotional, spiritual, physical,
[791.68 - 796.16] and how difficult it really is. And
[794.08 - 799.20] that's what they say. And the same goes
[796.16 - 800.96] for somebody who isn't an athlete. Maybe
[799.20 - 803.68] they're just somebody that never got
[800.96 - 806.64] sick yet. They're not there yet. Maybe
[803.68 - 809.92] they're in their 20s, their 30s, maybe
[806.64 - 812.16] early 40s. Nothing really happened. It's
[809.92 - 814.48] really small stuff. They're living their
[812.16 - 818.40] life. They're doing what they want and
[814.48 - 820.40] suddenly it all stops. They get sick and
[818.40 - 823.36] now they're chronically ill. They're
[820.40 - 825.60] going doctor to doctor to doctor and
[823.36 - 828.48] they're realizing it's a different
[825.60 - 831.12] world. It's a different part of them.
[828.48 - 833.76] They have to dig deeper than they've
[831.12 - 836.00] ever dug before. They have to get to
[833.76 - 838.32] know themselves because that's what
[836.00 - 840.40] happens. You have to get to know
[838.32 - 843.04] yourself. You learn things about
[840.40 - 845.44] yourself you would have never learned if
[843.04 - 848.80] it wasn't for getting sick. And do they
[845.44 - 851.84] have what it takes? Do they have what
[848.80 - 854.32] you have? Can they sustain themselves
[851.84 - 857.28] emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and
[854.32 - 859.60] physically before they find the
[857.28 - 863.12] information, before they find the
[859.60 - 865.84] knowledge, the keys to how to heal, to
[863.12 - 868.00] how to move forward? And they will they
[865.84 - 870.64] will sustain themselves. They will
[868.00 - 875.28] discover that inner strength. Whatever
[870.64 - 877.36] guilt you hold, whatever guilt you have,
[875.28 - 880.56] whatever guilt that sits deep down
[877.36 - 882.16] inside of you during the process of your
[880.56 - 885.60] healing,
[882.16 - 888.32] it's time for it to shed away. It's time
[885.60 - 890.64] to leave it behind. You didn't create
[888.32 - 892.88] your chronic illness. You didn't bring
[890.64 - 895.36] yourself to this place of chronic
[892.88 - 898.64] illness. You didn't bring yourself
[895.36 - 900.96] purposely to a place of sickness. It's
[898.64 - 903.60] not something you wanted. It's not
[900.96 - 906.72] something you did on purpose. You didn't
[903.60 - 909.36] do it at all. You didn't purposely do
[906.72 - 911.84] this to become unwell. It's not a
[909.36 - 916.16] contract you signed before you were
[911.84 - 918.56] born. You became unwell, sick. You
[916.16 - 921.52] became chronically ill for reasons that
[918.56 - 924.64] were not in your control. But what is in
[921.52 - 928.48] your control is your healing. No matter
[924.64 - 932.00] what, you can heal. It is in your
[928.48 - 934.08] control. And you are going to heal. As
[932.00 - 936.64] each day goes by, you're getting closer
[934.08 - 939.84] to healing. Your body's repairing
[936.64 - 942.24] itself. Your body's recovering. Your
[939.84 - 945.36] body wants to heal. It's working hard
[942.24 - 949.44] for you every single day. So each
[945.36 - 951.68] moment, each hour, each day, you're in
[949.44 - 954.24] the healing process. And you have to
[951.68 - 957.12] remember that you have to know that you
[954.24 - 960.08] are healing and you didn't cause your
[957.12 - 964.48] sickness and it's not mistakes that you
[960.08 - 966.48] made. Never believe in any way that it's
[964.48 - 968.80] because of you and because of any
[966.48 - 971.28] mistakes you made along the way because
[968.80 - 974.96] that's not true. That's not how chronic
[971.28 - 978.16] illness works. We cannot judge ourselves
[974.96 - 981.36] for why we're sick. We cannot beat
[978.16 - 984.40] ourselves up for why we're sick. We have
[981.36 - 986.96] to be gentle about it. We have to be
[984.40 - 989.68] easy on ourselves. We have to have
[986.96 - 992.64] compassion for ourselves. And you have
[989.68 - 995.60] to know that every day your body is
[992.64 - 997.44] getting closer to healing. If you get a
[995.60 - 999.84] chance, check out the medical medium

[1014.24 - 1020.64] Many blessings and God bless you.
[1018.08 - 1023.44] Your body is fighting for you every day
[1020.64 - 1026.40] and loves you unconditionally. Your body
[1023.44 - 1028.48] wants to heal and it will heal. And it
[1026.40 - 1031.52] is healing. And it's healing every
[1028.48 - 1034.64] single hour of every single day. This is
[1031.52 - 1037.84] a truth you can hold on to and never let
[1034.64 - 1041.28] it go. Let it be a healing seed, a seed
[1037.84 - 1043.04] that's planted, a seed that grows with
[1041.28 - 1045.36] every little thing you do for your
[1043.04 - 1048.80] health. Always remember you're a good
[1045.36 - 1051.52] person. And this is your time to heal.
[1048.80 - 1054.40] Never be hard on yourself. Never judge
[1051.52 - 1058.16] yourself. Every single morning you wake
[1054.40 - 1061.76] up, gently pat yourself on the shoulder.
[1058.16 - 1064.48] Tell yourself you're working hard. Tell
[1061.76 - 1067.04] yourself you're working for God. Tell
[1064.48 - 1069.52] yourself God sees you and understands
[1067.04 - 1072.88] your struggles. And tell yourself your
[1069.52 - 1075.60] body just did more healing. And when you
[1072.88 - 1078.64] lay down to go to bed at night, keep in
[1075.60 - 1081.60] mind you have an audience. Keep in mind
[1078.64 - 1084.40] the angels are there. Call upon them.
[1081.60 - 1087.20] Ask them to sit by your bedside. You
[1084.40 - 1089.36] deserve it. You're worthy. You're worth
[1087.20 - 1091.76] it to the angels. They see your
[1089.36 - 1094.56] struggles. They know what a good person
[1091.76 - 1097.04] you are. They know the good works you're
[1094.56 - 1099.52] going to do when you're healed. They
[1097.04 - 1101.52] know the good works you're doing now.
[1099.52 - 1104.72] And the angels know what kind of soul
[1101.52 - 1107.12] you have, what kind of soul you are. And
[1104.72 - 1110.08] never doubt who you are. You're a good
[1107.12 - 1112.48] soul. It's not your fault you got sick.
[1110.08 - 1115.60] You didn't create it. You didn't cause
[1112.48 - 1118.80] it. It wasn't a form of punishment God
[1115.60 - 1122.16] was placing upon you. And you can heal
[1118.80 - 1125.36] and you will heal. This is your time.
[1122.16 - 1127.52] And always keep in the back of your mind
[1125.36 - 1129.76] that good days are coming. And you're
[1127.52 - 1131.52] going to look back in the past and
[1129.76 - 1136.48] you're going to see how far you have
[1131.52 - 1139.64] come, how far along you have gone with
[1136.48 - 1139.64] your healing.
[1148.32 - 1151.32] Original
[1168.00 - 1171.92] published medical medium information
[1169.76 - 1173.92] gets stolen and poached by podcast
[1171.92 - 1175.84] doctors, social media doctors,
[1173.92 - 1177.60] influencers, and medical clinics.
[1175.84 - 1179.44] Medical medium information has never yet
[1177.60 - 1181.44] been proven wrong by medical science and
[1179.44 - 1183.12] research. Instead, the opposite, only
[1181.44 - 1185.04] proven right and then taken from medical
[1183.12 - 1186.72] medium published material and used in
[1185.04 - 1188.72] the conventional and alternative health
[1186.72 - 1190.72] communities. Medical medium information
[1188.72 - 1192.24] continually sets the stage for medical
[1190.72 - 1194.24] science to understand chronic illness
[1192.24 - 1196.16] better. If you choose to share or use
[1194.24 - 1198.08] the original unique content from the
[1196.16 - 1200.40] Medical Medium podcast, books, or
[1198.08 - 1202.00] Medical Medium social media, please site
[1200.40 - 1203.36] where this information comes from so
[1202.00 - 1204.88] others who see and learn of this
[1203.36 - 1206.40] information have a chance to know where
[1204.88 - 1208.16] it all originates to give them an
[1206.40 - 1209.92] opportunity to heal so they don't end up
[1208.16 - 1211.92] losing years of their life searching for
[1209.92 - 1213.76] answers like so many have before them.
[1211.92 - 1215.76] The medical medium information here on
[1213.76 - 1217.68] this podcast doesn't come from broken
[1215.76 - 1219.68] science, interest groups, medical
[1217.68 - 1222.40] funding with strings attached, botched
[1219.68 - 1224.48] research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,
[1222.40 - 1226.56] persuaded belief systems, private panels
[1224.48 - 1228.24] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1226.56 - 1230.08] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1228.24 - 1232.00] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1230.08 - 1233.92] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1232.00 - 1235.76] before in our modern-day history, it
[1233.92 - 1237.60] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1235.76 - 1239.36] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1237.60 - 1241.04] Medical medium information has street
[1239.36 - 1242.24] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1241.04 - 1244.00] countless people around the world
[1242.24 - 1245.84] healing more healing stories of real
[1244.00 - 1248.00] people not being paid to tell their
[1245.84 - 1249.60] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1248.00 - 1251.68] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1249.60 - 1253.36] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1251.68 - 1254.88] their lives back and finally healing
[1253.36 - 1256.32] when nothing else in the world of health
[1254.88 - 1258.40] could move the needle and get them
[1256.32 - 1260.72] better. The information on this podcast
[1258.40 - 1262.56] is not man-made. It comes from above,

[1264.56 - 1267.76] the light, or the creator, or if you
[1266.40 - 1269.04] believe in nothing at all, that we're
[1267.76 - 1270.80] just floating through space together on
[1269.04 - 1272.56] this rock, know that the information you
[1270.80 - 1274.32] hear on this podcast is separate from
[1272.56 - 1276.00] all the other noise out there. It comes
