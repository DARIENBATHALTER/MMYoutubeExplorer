[597.92 - 602.08] a child
[600.24 - 604.40] and then the medical treatments and then
[602.08 - 606.48] this stupidity and all kinds of stuff
[604.40 - 608.80] and you just get sicker and sicker and
[606.48 - 608.80] sicker
[609.12 - 613.84] and then you have a heart attack
[611.84 - 616.08] but you were miserable for all those

[624.08 - 628.40] you out
[625.52 - 630.72] you were miserable all those years
[628.40 - 632.32] before a brain tumor took you out you
[630.72 - 634.16] were miserable and that's how it's
[632.32 - 636.16] getting done now

[636.16 - 639.28] you're born deficient you don't really
[638.00 - 641.12] take care of yourself you don't know
[639.28 - 643.12] what to do no one teaches you you live
[641.12 - 645.36] your life you go decades down decades
[643.12 - 648.80] down and then you get your brain tumor
[645.36 - 648.80] but you had a good life
[649.20 - 654.00] it's not like that anymore you're sick
[651.12 - 657.04] with fatigue brain fog
[654.00 - 659.52] anxiety you've got numbness on your body
[657.04 - 661.36] tingles on your body you know you're not

[669.20 - 673.20] you're sick
[670.88 - 675.60] and then you get
[673.20 - 676.48] whatever's gonna happen
[675.60 - 678.48] so
[676.48 - 680.48] what are we gonna do about it
[678.48 - 682.72] that's what i wanna know so i have
[680.48 - 684.40] spirit of compassion
[682.72 - 686.00] right
[684.40 - 688.24] what are we gonna do
[686.00 - 690.32] and it's like we do the tools we bring
[688.24 - 693.60] them into our life
[690.32 - 697.44] we get medical devices
[693.60 - 699.76] that will probably someday be outlawed
[697.44 - 703.04] i wouldn't doubt it
[699.76 - 706.56] if 15 years from now you're not allowed
[703.04 - 708.00] to have a juicer in this world
[706.56 - 709.92] your doctor will have to write a
[708.00 - 712.16] prescription to see if you're eligible
[709.92 - 713.04] for a juicer
[712.16 - 715.04] okay
[713.04 - 716.56] not to mention 15 years down the road
[715.04 - 719.84] you might not be able to grow your own
[716.56 - 720.72] fruit tree in your yard
[719.84 - 722.32] because
[720.72 - 725.76] the forces of evil want to take
[722.32 - 727.76] everything away from everybody
[725.76 - 729.92] infect them
[727.76 - 732.56] make them sick and poison them

[1488.08 - 1491.12] okay
[1489.44 - 1493.52] it's the light
[1491.12 - 1495.92] it's not like something toxic like
[1493.52 - 1497.68] vinegar something toxic
[1495.92 - 1500.40] right
[1497.68 - 1502.08] or nutritional yeast with msg
[1500.40 - 1504.56] right
[1502.08 - 1506.32] or something else
[1504.56 - 1507.84] millions of dollars hundreds of millions
[1506.32 - 1510.72] of dollars are being put into that to
[1507.84 - 1514.00] brainwash you that's dirty

[1514.00 - 1519.68] that's dark and dirty that's what that
[1516.64 - 1522.00] is that's not of the light because a
[1519.68 - 1523.12] those things don't fix anybody b
[1522.00 - 1524.88] hundreds of millions of dollars are
[1523.12 - 1526.40] being put into it to brainwash you while
[1524.88 - 1529.20] it's not fixing you
[1526.40 - 1531.28] right that's nasty
[1529.20 - 1532.96] this is pure
[1531.28 - 1534.56] this is pure
[1532.96 - 1537.12] of the light
[1534.56 - 1539.20] right when you drink this you can
[1537.12 - 1541.44] actually be rest assured that there
[1539.20 - 1543.68] isn't hundreds of millions of dollars
[1541.44 - 1546.00] trying to brainwash you being spent
[1543.68 - 1549.28] every day on television all over the
[1546.00 - 1551.92] internet on youtube ads ads to trick you
[1549.28 - 1554.48] into trying something
[1551.92 - 1556.56] this is because people got better
[1554.48 - 1558.16] and they tell another person
[1556.56 - 1562.16] that's what this is
[1558.16 - 1562.16] so this is of the light right here
[1562.96 - 1568.24] and that's the difference
[1565.84 - 1571.52] think about that
[1568.24 - 1573.28] and that's the difference

[1585.12 - 1589.44] yeah
[1587.04 - 1592.08] it's it's it's it's actually
[1589.44 - 1594.24] it's actually a ridiculous idea

[1594.24 - 1598.40] people have poured into my office with
[1595.76 - 1599.84] all kinds of conditions they tried it

[1601.36 - 1606.16] tried it did it fix them no it didn't
[1603.36 - 1606.16] but here's the thing
[1606.24 - 1610.56] you might do some urine therapy

[1627.60 - 1631.28] terrible idea
[1629.12 - 1634.72] it's toxic
[1631.28 - 1634.72] it's really a bad idea
[1634.96 - 1639.68] first of all

[1670.40 - 1676.40] a very high profile person came to me
[1673.36 - 1679.60] years ago for help
[1676.40 - 1681.44] they were being guided by a health guru
[1679.60 - 1683.60] on the health scene
[1681.44 - 1686.32] that was somewhat known
[1683.60 - 1688.64] and that health guru was telling
[1686.32 - 1691.76] this extremely high profile person with
[1688.64 - 1694.08] their sickness to do urine therapy
[1691.76 - 1695.36] this person was doing it and staying
[1694.08 - 1698.56] sick

[2077.68 - 2082.72] doesn't talk lymphatic system
[2079.76 - 2083.84] that's ridiculous
[2082.72 - 2086.32] if you don't
[2083.84 - 2087.76] take care of the liver
[2086.32 - 2088.88] i've written a book about the liver
[2087.76 - 2090.32] right liver rescue if you don't take
[2088.88 - 2092.00] care of the liver
[2090.32 - 2093.52] then you can never take care of your
[2092.00 - 2096.08] lymphatic system
[2093.52 - 2097.68] lymphatic system is this the dump yard
[2096.08 - 2100.40] for the liver
[2097.68 - 2102.40] i don't get it okay do all the massage
[2100.40 - 2104.08] on your lymphatic system you want you
[2102.40 - 2106.16] can do all that you can do

[2106.16 - 2111.04] want with your lymphatic system
[2108.80 - 2113.52] you can jump on your rebounder you can
[2111.04 - 2115.20] do massage okay
[2113.52 - 2117.84] lymphatic massage you can do all these
[2115.20 - 2119.76] things but unless you fix the liver and
[2117.84 - 2121.68] clean it up
[2119.76 - 2123.36] you'll just be chasing
[2121.68 - 2126.08] your tail
[2123.36 - 2127.52] you'll chase your tail
[2126.08 - 2129.20] and there's only theories about what
[2127.52 - 2130.72] makes the lymphatic system good or bad
[2129.20 - 2131.92] or what helps the lymphatic system it's
[2130.72 - 2133.12] just theories
[2131.92 - 2134.56] theories that develop from people that
[2133.12 - 2136.32] don't even know why anybody's sick to
[2134.56 - 2138.64] begin with
[2136.32 - 2141.04] but that's the tail chasing problem
[2138.64 - 2143.04] happens i'm trying to fix my lymphatic
[2141.04 - 2145.92] system trying to fix my lymphatic system
[2143.04 - 2147.84] what you got to be fixing your liver is
[2145.92 - 2150.08] what you got to be fixing or you're just
[2147.84 - 2151.84] chasing your tail that's what you feel
[2150.08 - 2153.36] like that dog that chases the tail until
[2151.84 - 2154.72] you've got to try to stop the dog and
[2153.36 - 2157.04] say it's okay you don't have to chase
[2154.72 - 2159.20] your tail anymore
[2157.04 - 2161.68] that was fun but we got to stop chasing
[2159.20 - 2161.68] our tail
[2162.72 - 2166.88] your lymphatic system's only as good as
[2164.40 - 2168.40] your liver stagnant sluggish livers is
[2166.88 - 2170.88] what everybody has
[2168.40 - 2173.28] that's how the weight comes on
[2170.88 - 2176.08] and the overflow of that toxic liver
[2173.28 - 2177.92] goes into the lymphatic system
[2176.08 - 2180.16] the overflow of that toxic liver goes
[2177.92 - 2182.96] into the lymphatic system i have to say
[2180.16 - 2184.80] it twice if i don't because here's what
[2182.96 - 2187.04] happens everybody thinks oh the
[2184.80 - 2188.72] lymphatic system that's where to go hey
[2187.04 - 2190.24] i'm talking to another person about
[2188.72 - 2192.32] lymphatic system
[2190.24 - 2194.64] yeah i'm taking this new lymphatic
[2192.32 - 2197.60] system product right here said i'm doing
[2194.64 - 2199.36] uh what who's lymphatic system product
[2197.60 - 2200.96] like didn't even know why you're sick
[2199.36 - 2202.32] and you're taking just a hush posh stuff
[2200.96 - 2204.72] thrown together
[2202.32 - 2206.16] like a theory
[2204.72 - 2208.32] here's the thing
[2206.16 - 2210.40] medical medium information gets people
[2208.32 - 2212.16] better because not only
[2210.40 - 2215.20] does it make sense
[2212.16 - 2217.52] but because there's a real reason
[2215.20 - 2219.76] why it works
[2217.52 - 2222.64] you can't clean your lymphatic system
[2219.76 - 2224.56] unless that liver is cleaned up
[2222.64 - 2225.68] your lymphatic system is your dumping
[2224.56 - 2228.16] ground
[2225.68 - 2230.48] it's your garbage can for the liver
[2228.16 - 2232.16] liver gets over filled it gets stagnant
[2230.48 - 2234.08] sluggish and it pours all into your
[2232.16 - 2237.36] lymphatic system and you can play with
[2234.08 - 2238.80] that lymphatic system all you want
[2237.36 - 2240.32] but until
[2238.80 - 2242.88] you do what you need to do and that's
[2240.32 - 2244.96] one of the tools right there can you do
[2242.88 - 2247.04] something for it there's a lot of bad
[2244.96 - 2247.84] ideas out there
[2247.04 - 2249.52] okay
[2247.84 - 2251.84] and in order to heal you've got to know
[2249.52 - 2253.68] how to weave in and out of them
[2251.84 - 2255.92] bypass them it's like driving your car
[2253.68 - 2257.52] into a pothole you see or you see
[2255.92 - 2259.60] something on the highway like a rubber
[2257.52 - 2260.64] tire that popped off a truck
[2259.60 - 2262.64] right
[2260.64 - 2264.24] you see a top pieces of tire all over
[2262.64 - 2266.56] the highway with metal sticking out of
[2264.24 - 2267.44] the tire right you're on the highway
[2266.56 - 2268.88] okay
[2267.44 - 2270.80] what do you do you just you just run
[2268.88 - 2273.84] right over that tire
[2270.80 - 2276.00] 65 miles an hour is that what you do
[2273.84 - 2278.40] when you do that you're eventually gonna
[2276.00 - 2279.84] pop your tire and go off the road and
[2278.40 - 2282.88] crash
[2279.84 - 2282.88] and possibly die
[2282.96 - 2288.96] so mm info is so we don't have to weave
[2287.04 - 2290.96] so we can you know don't have to just
[2288.96 - 2292.64] run over those tires
[2290.96 - 2295.84] so instead we can be like whoa we got a
[2292.64 - 2297.36] tire coming let's get around it whoa
[2295.84 - 2299.92] wait a minute i was just sold on a whole
[2297.36 - 2301.44] lymphatic drainage program i spent three
[2299.92 - 2303.28] thousand dollars on when i could have
[2301.44 - 2304.96] purchased a ten dollar medical medium
[2303.28 - 2306.64] book and found out that the liver needed
[2304.96 - 2311.64] to be cleaned up let me weave around
[2306.64 - 2311.64] that tire oh the tire boom boom
[2319.68 - 2323.20] and then for a street cred i got to
[2321.44 - 2325.28] mention it because it just gets stickier
[2323.20 - 2328.24] and stickier and uglier uglier out there
[2325.28 - 2331.68] each year after each year
[2328.24 - 2334.32] and the ghouls come out
[2331.68 - 2337.04] is what they do
[2334.32 - 2338.48] pure and of the light there isn't
[2337.04 - 2340.40] hundreds of millions of dollars going
[2338.48 - 2344.40] into this to get you to drink it every
[2340.40 - 2346.96] day on television there isn't anything
[2344.40 - 2348.80] nothing just people getting better while
[2346.96 - 2350.56] people out there are getting sicker and
[2348.80 - 2353.20] sicker and sicker
[2350.56 - 2356.32] check out the medical device see mm-900
[2353.20 - 2358.72] hds omega juicers.com
[2356.32 - 2361.76] it's a medical device
[2358.72 - 2363.92] this is an herbal extract tonic
[2361.76 - 2366.16] and herbal extract it's not going to
[2363.92 - 2367.60] happen by just having a celery stick
[2366.16 - 2368.96] sure sure
[2367.60 - 2372.64] sure
[2368.96 - 2375.28] definitely have celery in your diet
[2372.64 - 2377.52] making a little salad right you making a
[2375.28 - 2379.60] little salad you chop up some yeah you
[2377.52 - 2381.12] guys put this on my salad it's gonna be
[2379.60 - 2382.80] great
[2381.12 - 2384.96] right
[2382.80 - 2386.96] you shouldn't be eating tuna fish
[2384.96 - 2388.64] you can pop a few pieces in your tuna
[2386.96 - 2390.08] fish salad but you shouldn't be eating
[2388.64 - 2391.20] tuna fish right
[2390.08 - 2393.44] right
[2391.20 - 2396.72] you can definitely have right here you
[2393.44 - 2399.36] can have some celery pieces
[2396.72 - 2401.12] my dogs love celery pieces
[2399.36 - 2403.76] right but i actually give my dog some
[2401.12 - 2407.68] celery juice
[2403.76 - 2407.68] the celery pieces aren't enough
[2408.88 - 2413.52] you guys a couple of notes on
[2411.04 - 2416.56] deficiencies
[2413.52 - 2418.56] we got to put back in the tank
[2416.56 - 2420.32] we got to get we got to get it back in
[2418.56 - 2422.32] the tank it's like that boat the water's
[2420.32 - 2424.72] filling in you can't shovel it out fast
[2422.32 - 2426.64] enough and the boat sinks
[2424.72 - 2427.52] and right now the world's getting to a
[2426.64 - 2430.24] place
[2427.52 - 2432.00] where they're hitting you on all sides
[2430.24 - 2433.60] yeah we can just be in denial and
[2432.00 - 2435.84] pretend it's not happening and then you
[2433.60 - 2437.60] step in and then something happens
[2435.84 - 2439.12] and then we're in trouble but they're
[2437.60 - 2441.20] hitting this on all sides and that's how
[2439.12 - 2444.56] they do it so guess what
[2441.20 - 2447.36] this is one of the tools to bring in
[2444.56 - 2449.60] get the mineral salts inside the brain
[2447.36 - 2451.92] get the vitamin c that comes from this
[2449.60 - 2454.24] right here you know get the chemical
[2451.92 - 2456.08] compounds that restore

[2457.68 - 2461.92] liver flushed out you get that toxic
[2459.92 - 2462.96] stuff flushed out man anything's
[2461.92 - 2466.08] possible
[2462.96 - 2468.72] anything's possible and most importantly
[2466.08 - 2470.96] you kill off pathogens
[2468.72 - 2472.56] i've been talking about viruses for 35
[2470.96 - 2474.08] plus years actually even when i was
[2472.56 - 2476.72] younger right
[2474.08 - 2479.20] okay tempo viruses still was blue in the
[2476.72 - 2482.64] face a ton of viruses talk about viruses
[2479.20 - 2482.64] talk about viruses right
[2483.28 - 2487.52] and what are we talking about today now

[2497.20 - 2502.08] to need those medical medium tools it's
[2498.88 - 2502.08] going to be their only chance
[2502.64 - 2505.92] it's going to be their only chance
[2506.32 - 2509.28] it is
[2507.52 - 2510.96] going to get ugly it's been a lot of
[2509.28 - 2513.52] contamination
