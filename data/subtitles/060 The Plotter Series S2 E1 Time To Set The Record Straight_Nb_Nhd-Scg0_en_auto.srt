1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,120
holy [ __ ] we need to get this guy off

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,000
the internet like we need to just take

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,519
it all down it's like evil runs through

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,160
all of us

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,480
and I don't know it's just like to me

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,439
that sums up the whole cuz I I'm not

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,680
over here trying to pretend I'm a

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,560
s go you it

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
that's of course I've committed horrible

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,279
acts but you know you didn't even have

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,599
to do anything bad in your

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,879
ha he's Conant

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,360
watching Anthony

14
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:37,640
and just grabbing every little bit of

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,920
information that he thinks could be

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,160
helpful to take him down and I remember

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
one time you know I had this kind of

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,239
like a I've talked about a little bit

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,520
before so my my kind of my dark dark

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,600
days um I felt this voice and it was

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
like you know if you nothing else has

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,239
been working for you you should kind of

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
like thought maybe maybe you need to

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,480
come work on my side it's a long story

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
but in the nutshell

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,920
there was a voice that was like you

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,880
should come work for leave the light

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,640
come work for the other side and I

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,360
remember falling on the floor and in

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,400
tears being like I will never never work

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,240
for the dark like I I don't care if I'm

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,799
in a wheelchair or a bed bound or die I

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,759
will never switch TS and I'm telling you

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,400
that moment something lifted off my

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,320
chest like and then I knew I knew I was

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,880
like you demon whatever is in my body I

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,560
don't know what Megan's told you but it

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,600
will be interesting to see what the

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,320
response when this comes out you know

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,520
yeah what do you think is going to

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,960
happen I think there will be a parting

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,399
of the Red

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,119
Seas initially and I think that it will

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,399
definitely ruffle some feathers and I

45
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,719
think that there will be a large

46
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,399
community of people who share it um I

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,680
think me it's coming out VY fair so it

48
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:57,159
will be widely will be widely shared

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,000
yeah no matter what Amber and Anthony

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,479
have no idea what's in store for them in

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,479
the coming

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,640
years years ago a group of people

53
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,119
secretly teamed up and did everything

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,959
they could to try to knock me out of the

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480
health space they formed a multi-step

56
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,360
long-term plan to create a quote

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,599
post-medical medium era by feeding false

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,200
information to mainstream media

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,800
companies anonymously like they did to

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,760
Vanity Fair last year using a false

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,319
story about a woman named Stephanie who

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
passed away from cancer years ago this

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
group thought they could destroy my

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,360
reputation with a series of hitpiece

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Articles against me without anybody

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,640
knowing who was behind it all so that

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,120
they couldn't be held accountable until

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,480
they reached their goal they ultimately

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,200
wanted the hit pieces to lead to

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,040
securing themselves a deal for an

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
anti-ed medium documentary on Netflix

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,400
and would then bring Fame and other

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,280
benefits to them this group had been

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,959
working on their plan for a long time

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,000
secretly recruiting more people to join

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,200
them along the way using false

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,319
information and false stories about me

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,159
but their plan was thored last year when

79
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,519
this group tried to recruit a woman

80
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,319
named Amber visicaro an alternative

81
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,239
medicine practitioner who's been a part

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,640
of the medical medium Community for over

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,280
7 years Amber decided to legally record

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,519
her phone calls with the leaders of this

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,200
group for her own protection and safy

86
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,120
because she immediately felt that

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,879
something was off she ended up capturing

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,680
evidence of the identities of the main

89
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,400
individuals behind this Sinister plot

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,080
and sadly all of them no exaggeration

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,959
are people who have been helped by

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,319
medical medium information and even some

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,319
by me personally in their Darkest Hours

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,560
whether it was with their health or

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,640
their career or both Amber captured

96
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,840
evidence of this massive betrayal proof

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,879
that this group is Rife with ulterior

98
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,040
motives and has been led by individuals

99
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,560
with Platforms in the health industry

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,400
who want to take me out and a documented

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,799
record of the verifiably false stories

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
and Flatout lies they've been telling

103
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,639
people about me to try to get them on

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,080
their side her recordings serve as a

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,199
record of the entire recruitment process

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,560
and the recruitment tactics for example

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,120
they tried to to sell Amber on the idea

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
that she could be made famous by Vanity

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,919
Fair if she turned against me and let

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,039
the journalists position her as the

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,560
leader of the post-medical medium era

112
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,400
mean I I've been thinking about this for

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,000
a long time like you definitely have an

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,440
opportunity to be a leader in what I

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,240
would call the postmed medium era and

116
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,840
having him put you on a platform and be

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,440
like a leader of this era would could be

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,759
good for you Amber knew that what was

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,520
happening was very wrong and instead of

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,720
joining them she came on four episodes

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,280
of the medical medium podcast last year

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
and used her recordings facts and

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
evidence to expose this group the

124
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,240
details of their multi-step plot their

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,400
malevolent and ulterior motives and the

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,840
verifiably false information they'd been

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
trying to spread and publish in order to

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,080
take medical medium and the community

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,560
down what we covered was appalling and

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,440
shock so many of you to the core and yet

131
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,440
there is so much more to the story this

132
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,840
is truly one of the biggest scandals

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
that has ever happened in the health

134
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,479
industry as you'll see it's also one of

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,440
the biggest instances of capturing

136
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,800
corruption within the mainstream media

137
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,000
this episode is the first in what's

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,800
going to be a full-blown expose Amber

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,759
vakaro is back on here with me today and

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,160
she's going to be joining me in an

141
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,080
ongoing series series of many podcast

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,280
episodes in which we are going to be

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,080
thoroughly exposing this group that we

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,960
refer to as the plotters and dismantling

145
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,199
their Web of Lies alterative motives and

146
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,000
much more some of the evidence we're

147
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,639
presenting in these episodes includes

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,599
original written content such as text

149
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,599
messages and social media posts that

150
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,720
have been produced by the plotters and

151
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,080
will be reenacted for greater ease in

152
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,639
following along those who are listening

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,759
to the podcast can find video versions

154
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,080
of these episodes on the medical medium

155
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,560
YouTube and Rumble channels that will be

156
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,120
displaying screenshots photos videos and

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,440
more Amber thank you for being here

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,000
again can you start by explaining why

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,120
we're back here doing this

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
again thanks Anthony it's crazy that

161
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,479
it's been over a year since we released

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,120
the first round of podcast episodes

163
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,879
about this group and part of me is

164
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,400
pained by the fact that we're back here

165
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,759
addressing this again because I know

166
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,160
that what we all want more than anything

167
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,280
is to be able to move on from this

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,759
deranged plot and all of this group's

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,560
just really dark and nasty attacks but

170
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,280
we're back here again because even after

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,879
being exposed and proven wrong last year

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,280
the plotters did not stop

173
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,039
plotting in fact they escalated their

174
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,560
behavior significantly to the point that

175
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,639
it's become allout expressions of

176
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,639
Senseless hatred they took to social

177
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,199
media and put their true intentions on

178
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,120
display as they began terrorizing

179
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,639
publicly attacking bullying harassing

180
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,560
shaming and humiliating chronically ill

181
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,360
people in the medical medium Community

182
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
who are just minding their own business

183
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,479
trying to

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,199
heal this hateful group has disturbingly

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,159
targeted and attacked moms and even

186
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,960
children if someone in the community

187
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,520
tried to defend themselves against these

188
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
attacks the plotters would Gaslight them

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,280
flip it around portray them eles to be

190
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,400
the victims and label medical medium

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,400
community members as being bullies when

192
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,759
the plotters were in fact the

193
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,240
aggressors throughout the past year this

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,919
organized hateful group has issued

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,800
threats toward Anthony and myself

196
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,960
they've repeatedly expressed clear

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,240
intent to harm medical medium and the

198
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,720
community they've deliberately tried to

199
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,199
stop Anthony from doing a free event to

200
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,560
support and raise money for the

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,599
community they've posted videos of

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,159
themselves burning medical media books

203
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:36,479
and they've incited for others to do the

204
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,200
same okay all these medical medium books

205
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,440
are going to be burned

206
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,440
today it's

207
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,560
happening this is going in first celery

208
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,959
juice

209
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,880
one I took out the insides cuz it's

210
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,880
going to take forever to

211
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,040
burn this is not a joke this organized

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,000
hateful group has even gone as far as to

213
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,880
issue a public statement calling for

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,920
Anthony himself to be exterminated by

215
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,440
fire if you're watching the video

216
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,200
version of this episode you'll see a

217
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,640
social media graphic titled Pest Control

218
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,519
cheat sheet that has a list of options

219
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,040
that you can use to repel or kill pests

220
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,519
like ants and spiders you'll see that

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
someone who has been involved with the

222
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,800
plotters rehar it and added medical

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,560
medium

224
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,920
fire you don't have to like Anthony you

225
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,959
don't have to like medical medium

226
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,800
information medical medium information

227
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,640
is always has gotten plenty of criticism

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,600
because anything Leading Edge always

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,240
does and there's a lot of spiritual

230
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,360
discrimination out there this is

231
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,160
different this is just objectively wrong

232
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,079
and unacceptable Behavior this is a

233
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,200
barrage of baseless attacks that are

234
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,120
completely devoid of rationality Truth

235
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,440
and

236
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,600
Sanity the plotters have spent the

237
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,560
entire past year still desperately

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,519
trying to create something that doesn't

239
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,399
exist they have pivoted so many times

240
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,640
shifting narratives and saying anything

241
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,320
to get a rise out of people and they've

242
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,399
manufactured and spread an unimaginable

243
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,320
number of New Lies they're still out

244
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
there trying to get attention from media

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,160
companies by playing dirty with lies and

246
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,480
verifiably false information which is

247
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,399
going to be thoroughly exposed in this

248
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,640
series they continue to use and exploit

249
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,880
deceased individuals and others in the

250
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,839
process of trying to get what they want

251
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,519
they continue to ignore reality they

252
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,279
thought that they had a meal ticket

253
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,000
because they had text messages from

254
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,360
Anthony that they took from a deceased

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
person's phone and manipulated to try to

256
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,720
frame a public figure to serve their own

257
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,000
agenda but it's too bad for them that we

258
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,480
have all of the text and other evidence

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,680
they're hiding that proves them wrong

260
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,000
and their admissions on recording and

261
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,920
more and we will use it all to set the

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,560
record straight as many times as we need

263
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,639
to and because their attempt to take

264
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,800
Anthony out using their false Stephanie

265
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,000
story was a failure and didn't get them

266
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,560
where they wanted to be they've had to

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
Pivot and manufacture entirely new

268
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,240
outrageously false

269
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,920
narratives that is why we're back here

270
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,680
doing this again but it's all coming out

271
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,760
this time around as you said Anthony

272
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,760
there is so much more to this story in

273
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,040
our previous episodes we held back on a

274
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,320
lot out of respect for Stephanie and the

275
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,920
family we only released what was

276
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,639
necessary to address the false

277
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,959
accusations at the time we also held

278
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,120
back on a lot about the plotter

279
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,880
purely as courtesy to them in hopes that

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,160
after being proven wrong they would at

281
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,240
the very least just

282
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,040
stop that is very much not what has

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,279
happened this organized hateful group is

284
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,680
still trying to rewrite history they are

285
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,920
spreading verifiably false information

286
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,839
they are flat out lying and they are

287
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,040
withholding and altering evidence as

288
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,680
they try to perpetuate their false

289
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
narratives so that courtesy is no longer

290
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,480
going to be

291
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,560
extended at at the time of my calls with

292
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,880
the plotters I knew enough to know that

293
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,440
what they were telling me was wrong but

294
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,200
I have now spent the entire past year of

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,800
my life thoroughly studying every detail

296
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,720
for myself every text thread every

297
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,600
communication with every one of the many

298
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,920
individuals who were involved every

299
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,040
audio every photo every video every

300
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,440
social media post every piece of data

301
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,440
that was submitted to us every

302
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,560
Everything organizing it all into

303
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,360
timelines forensically analyzing it

304
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,800
scrutinizing the facts and running it

305
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,519
all through fact checker and a legal

306
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,720
team this group is in for a rude

307
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,839
awakening we're going to be exposing

308
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,480
everything there's a lot that's coming

309
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,360
in these episodes and we want to prepare

310
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,279
everyone for it by first issuing a

311
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
trigger

312
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,600
warning we understand that content about

313
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,720
the activities of this organized hateful

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
group can be triggering for those who

315
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,000
have experienced serious betrayal

316
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,040
bullying harassment emotional trauma

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,199
manipulation and abuse so please take

318
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,320
care of yourself as you listen you might

319
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,160
want to have some lemon bomb tea or a

320
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
medical medium adrenal healing snack

321
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,360

listening for what's to come I'm going

324
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,560
to provide some shocking updates of

325
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,680
occurrences since our last series of

326
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,600
podcast episodes about this group as

327
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,000
well as some important context as to how

328
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,839
we got here today and I'm going to start

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,120
by officially releasing the names of the

330
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,160
plotters for the first time right now at

331
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,720
this point everyone deserves to know

332
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,320
exactly who and what they're really

333
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,720
dealing with the number one person

334
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,800
responsible for this plot a mountain of

335
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,240
Lies upon lies and all of the

336
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,800
chronically ill people who have been

337
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,720
harmed by all of it is a woman named

338
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,079
Ashley

339
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,920
Foster Ashley Foster is the one you

340
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,920
heard telling the original verifiably

341
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,600
false story about Stephanie Ashley is

342
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,440
the one you heard talking about how she

343
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,399
was hoping that a director or a producer

344
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,839
that her husband works with would be

345
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,839
interested in doing a negative

346
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
documentary about Anthony

347
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,120
and she's the one you heard saying that

348
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,519
because Anthony has such a presence that

349
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,880
a Netflix documentary is her goal

350
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,160
because then there would be no coming

351
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,320
back from that for

352
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,800
him um oh my

353
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:24,120
um yeah we're hopeful that once the

354
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:27,279
article's out um one of the directors or

355
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,320
producers that Britain works with

356
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,160
will uh you know become interested in

357
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,399
telling the story really well I think

358
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,279
it's going to take that because Anthony

359
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,279
is so um he has such a presence and if

360
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,720
it just stops at the article I'm

361
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,880
guessing that like there would be some

362
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,000
buzz in the medical medium Community for

363
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,160
a few months but like really I think

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,959
then it would kind of die down

365
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,519
ultimately the

366
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,720
way to really get the word out is like

367
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,759
would be like a Netflix documentary you

368
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,680
know

369
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,959
so um once you hit that

370
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,519
level of like being exposed there's kind

371
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,519
of no there's no coming back from

372
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,560
that Ashley is the ring leader of this

373
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,560
organized hateful group Ashley's

374
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,199
original false story about Stephanie is

375
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,959
the story that was given to Vanity Fair

376
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,320
as was reflected in the questions that

377
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,600
were asked of Anthony the questions

378
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,759
literally mirrored Ashley's very

379
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,959
distinct false story and we are going to

380
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,920
be reading those questions off in this

381
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:33,959
series Ashley's story was first posted

382
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,399
on social media in 2020 Ashley told more

383
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,600
than 15 verifiable falsities in the

384
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,480
comment section of that post Ashley told

385
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,440
more than 15 additional verifiable

386
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,240
falsities the next day Ashley posted an

387
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,800
adapted story to her blog at the time

388
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
and that version contained more than 20

389
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
verifiable falsities Ashley was sent a

390
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
legal letter informing her of the facts

391
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,959
and what she was wrong about Ashley was

392
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,560
asked to preserve a record of what she

393
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,680
had posted but instead Ashley decided to

394
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,040
delete all of it

395
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,639
immediately Ashley then spent years

396
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,319
plotting and scheming lying to people

397
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,720
around her trying to get them on her

398
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,480
side and against Anthony in 2022 Ashley

399
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
tried to get away with taking that same

400
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,920
false story about Stephanie from 2020 to

401
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,519
the media so that she could hide behind

402
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,639
anonymity as a source and therefore not

403
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,959
be held accountable for being wrong too

404
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,399
bad for her I CT captured her and her

405
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,560
hateful group exposing themselves on

406
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,560
recording last year since the article

407
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,399
and our podcast came out last year

408
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,519
Ashley has spearheaded a whole ongoing

409
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,160
smear campaign against Anthony and

410
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,279
medical medium information in addition

411
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,160
to all of the attacks the new lies

412
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,600
Ashley's been spreading all of the

413
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,000
pivoting she's done and the bullying

414
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Ashley has also been childishly ACC

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,399
costing people in the medical medium

416
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,000
Community via DM intentionally trying to

417
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,800
break them down and convince them to

418
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,880
stop applying medical medium

419
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:11,120
information hey I um just wanted to

420
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,120
slide into your DMs as a little

421
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,880
troublemaker after having spent years

422
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,079
littering lies and false information

423
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
about Stephanie everywhere every chance

424
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,039
she could get and claiming Stephanie to

425
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,400
be the reason why she started attacking

426
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,919
Anthony in the first place Ashley's now

427
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,440
very recently pivoted almost entirely

428
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,480
away from Stephan

429
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,640
and has conjured up new narratives about

430
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,880
medical medium information in general

431
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,320
that are even more verifiably wrong than

432
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
her fake story about Stephanie

433
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,559
throughout this series we will be

434
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,120

435
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,520
information about Ashley you're going to

436
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,400
learn all about Ashley's true motives

437
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,440
behind her desperate desire to want to

438
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,679
take Anthony down and the true history

439
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,960
that she's been hiding from everyone all

440
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,799
this time the pathological lies Ashley

441
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,840
has told all all while she's claimed to

442
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,799
be perfectly honest and morally Superior

443
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,679
are going to be put on display the

444
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,640
fabricated stor she's been telling for

445
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,159
years are going to unravel you'll learn

446
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
about individuals who have been

447
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,720
personally victimized attacked and

448
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,520
belied by Ashley Ashley's clearly

449
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,159
documented track record of being

450
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,159
dishonest and highly inaccurate and then

451
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,960
simply pivoting to the next false claim

452
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,000
when caught that has been playing out

453
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,600
for years is going to be uncovered

454
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,360
you're going to learn just how far

455
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,440
Ashley has gone with her lies what she

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,960
had to do to get Vanity Fair to run with

457
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,159
and publish their HIIT piece on Anthony

458
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,960
and much

459
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,039
more the number two person responsible

460
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,600
for this plot and all of the chronically

461
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,000
ill people who have been harmed by it as

462
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,840
many of you have figured out is Robbie

463
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,159
Barbaro Robbie has a health business he

464
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,520
was Anthony's friend Anthony helped him

465
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,559
a lot with his career and Robbie was

466
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,039
also my friend Robbie St us both in the

467
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,919
back Robbie lied to my face while he was

468
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,200
secretly plotting to destroy medical

469
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,720
medium in the community for over a year

470
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,360
during our friendship all while he was

471
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,320
actively using medical medium protocols

472
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,360
like the heavy metal detox celery juice

473
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,360
and specific medical medium recommended

474
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,600
supplements himself and even asking me

475
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,080
repeatedly for health advice when he was

476
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,679
very clear on the fact that it was

477
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,840
medical medium

478
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,039
information so here he is plotting to to

479
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,640
take down the medical medium Community

480
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,080
while he's using the medical medium

481
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,880
heavy metal detox celery juice and

482
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
supplement protocol information to

483
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,760
achieve better health for himself then

484
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,600
asking Amber for help while lying to her

485
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,480
and this is one of Ashley's closest

486
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,760
friends and Ashley said on a recording

487
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,799
that she believes there's like no one

488
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,880
more trustworthy than

489
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,360
Robbie but there's like no one more

490
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,039
trustworthy than Robie so I know that

491
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,080
whatever he shared with you it's like

492
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,039
spot on Amazing prime example of who the

493
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,480
plotters

494
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,320
are Robbie is the one you heard

495
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,159
detailing the plot and multi-step plan

496
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,039
using the infamous phrase postm medal

497
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,080
medium era stating that the plotter

498
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,720
vision is to create a negative

499
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,360
documentary about Anthony that would be

500
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,880
a quote [ __ ] hit on Netflix

501
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,799
describing how he had to give the

502
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,760
journalist the plotter sought out a lot

503
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,600
of direction for the hit piece how he

504
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,880
had to hammer their narrative into the

505
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,400
journalist's head how he had to point

506
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,520
the journalist here and point him there

507
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
and how he ultimately had to threaten

508
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,400
the journalist to get him to move

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,799
forward with the

510
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,679
article I connected with a lot of people

511
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,960
to it he really appreciated Ash and I

512
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,840
and then just gave him a lot of

513
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,360
direction for this piece we gave him a

514
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,840
lot of clarity sort of Tor like he he

515
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,120
was having a hard time wrapping his head

516
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,240
around a lot of it

517
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,200
like really Hammer his head like what's

518
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,600
going on and like explain the details

519
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,080
and point him towards this point him

520
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,799
towards that but I I was upset I said

521
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,480
Dam like he you are scared you're scared

522
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,760
like what's going on what's the delay

523
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,559
like you you have everything it's on the

524
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,440
[ __ ] you have all this stuff what do

525
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,279
you need and then I Bally

526
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,600
threaten there is a whole lot more to

527
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,640
the story with Robbie as well that again

528
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,440
I held back on because I was really

529
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,960
trying to avoid having to fully go there

530
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
with all of this publicly I only shared

531
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,200
what was necessary at the time but

532
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,400
because Robbie instigated and enabled

533
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,039
Ashley to get to where she is now that

534
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,760
she uses her platform to relentlessly

535
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:50,080
inflict harm upon the chronically ill

536
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,720
because Ashley won't stop even after

537
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,600
being caught lying and proven wrong with

538
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,279
facts and evidence because Ashley has

539
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,640
lied and lied and lied and lied some

540
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,679
more and even gone as far as to portray

541
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,760
Robbie as somehow being a victim in this

542
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,520
situation when that could not be any

543
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,320
further from reality it has become

544
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,400
necessary for me to fully set the record

545
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,039
straight on Robbie and I'm not holding

546
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,200
back on anything in this

547
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,080
series as you'll see and hear Robbie

548
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,080
could not find a fact about what

549
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,360
happened with Stephanie to save his life

550
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,039
Robbie has exhibited zero regard for the

551
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,720
actual truth in this matter Robbie

552
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,039
simply used an exploit Ed Stephanie just

553
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,320
like the rest of this group Robbie went

554
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,480
to Great Lengths to try to take Anthony

555
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,039
down for ulterior reasons which are

556
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,679
going to be exposed for the first time

557
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,120
and you're going to get to learn more

558
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,640
about who Robbie really is behind the

559
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,200
facade he portrays including his

560
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,679
documented track record of disrespecting

561
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,039
women and just being a shady person in

562
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,760
General Robbie has deeply hurt betrayed

563
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,039
and inflicted harm upon me as well as

564
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,240
Anthony and this community and it's time

565
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,400
for him to be held

566
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,360
accountable another person who I am

567
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,559
extremely disappointed to announce as

568
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,760
having been involved with this plot is

569
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:14,760
Christina cillo bugam raw Christina with

570
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,760
a K from Hawaii she just like Robbie has

571
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,559
a competitive Health business which can

572
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,120
lend to ulterior motives Christina is

573
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:23,960
the one you heard calling people in the

574
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,960
medical medium Community vampires and

575
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,559
spreading insane false rumors that she

576
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,600
admittedly didn't have accurate

577
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:32,120
information on and couldn't have cared

578
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,679
any less but to spread them

579
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,200
anyway Anthony that's not even his real

580
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,279
name by the way I'm not sure if you know

581
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,240
that it's not um it's not no it's not

582
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,279
what is

583
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:49,360
it um I don't even know I don't care

584
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,360
anymore that's not his real name

585
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,640
though Christina is also the one who

586
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,039
said that she believed there would be a

587
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,400
parting of the Red Seas after the

588
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,640
hitpiece that was fed by the plotters

589
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,279
about Anthony to Vanity Fair came

590
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,120
out I don't know what Megan told you but

591
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,039
it will be interesting to see what the

592
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,760
response is when this comes out you know

593
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,159
yeah what do you think is gonna

594
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,400
happen I think they will be a parting of

595
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
the Red

596
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,559
Seas initially and I think that it will

597
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
definitely ruffle some feathers and I

598
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,360
think that there will be a large

599
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,000
community of people who share it um I

600
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,720
mean it's coming out B be fair so will

601
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,919
be beely shared no matter

602
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,480
what Christina spent the entirety of my

603
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,480
call with her gossiping about Anthony

604
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,840
and sharing a bunch of absurd rumors

605
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,679
about him with me she admitted that

606
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,360
she'd engaged in name calling and

607
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,880
spreading rumors about Anthony around

608
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,799
the island that she lives on Christina

609
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,960
only said a little bit about Stephanie

610
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,760
and yet every single thing she told me

611
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,600
about Stephanie is provably wrong let's

612
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,159
just say a lot more is going to be

613
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,880
revealed in these

614
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,039
episodes it was very disconcerting for

615
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,960
me as I studied the recording of This

616
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,679
call and compared it with all of the

617
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,159
records of what actually happened with

618
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,360
Stephanie in 2017 to learn that

619
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,480
Christina had absolutely no clue what

620
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,000
happened just like the rest of these

621
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,520
people but that didn't stop Christina

622
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,039
from just saying whatever terrible

623
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,080
things she felt like saying about

624
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
Anthony that didn't stop her from

625
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,760
spreading rumors or from wanting to see

626
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,440
him smeared in the media

627
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,320
there are other individuals with health

628
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,960
businesses who are behind this plot to

629
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,799
take Anthony out including a woman named

630
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,640
Taylor call Taylor is the one you heard

631
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,080
in the previous episodes referring to

632
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,399
herself and the other members of this

633
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,279
hateful group as an elite category of

634
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:53,760
people but I'm letting you know

635
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:57,240
like we are an elite group of people we

636
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,320
we're in in Elite category

637
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,440
you Taylor is also the one who you heard

638
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,399
saying that she had to commit horrible

639
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,080
acts to get into the inner Inner Circle

640
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,799
of their

641
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,120
group

642
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,720
so well you're not a part of it Amber

643
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,399
you're in the inner Inner

644
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,600
Circle and you know you have to earn

645
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,600
your right to get in that Circle so

646
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,039
there you go you've earned it then

647
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,320
that's a rare spot to me and of course

648
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,640
I've committed horrible acts but you

649
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,240
know you didn't even have to do anything

650
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,240
bad in your ha

651
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,000
that recording gives me PTSD every time

652
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,480
I hear it Taylor was Stephanie's

653
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,520
caretaker that independently took charge

654
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,919
of many of Stephanie's medical decisions

655
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,080
when Stephanie was sick Taylor had

656
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,399
significant influence over Stephanie's

657
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,520
care for example when Stephanie would

658
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:53,600
get medical testing or

659
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,279
not interestingly Taylor has been

660
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
entirely hidden and omitted from the

661
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,880
stories that are told by Ashley

662
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Stephanie's brother and the other

663
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,200
plotters about Stephanie Taylor was also

664
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,320
entirely hidden and omitted from the

665
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,039
Vanity Fair article even though she was

666
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,080
a source that the journalists spoke to

667
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,120
but now in this series you will get to

668
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,080
hear the truth the facts and the

669
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,279
evidence of Taylor's role in what was

670
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,960
happening with Stephanie that alone

671
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,799
makes the narrative the plotters tried

672
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,039
to run with

673
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,919
impossible when Taylor tried to tell me

674
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,240
what happened with Stephanie from her

675
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,760
perspective not only have I now studied

676
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,960
all of the evidence that proves her

677
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,039
wrong which is going to be exposed in

678
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,200
this series but the number of times

679
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,480
Taylor said to me on recording in

680
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,919
regards to the facts of the story I

681
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,399
don't know it's all a blur I can't

682
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,760
remember or it doesn't matter is

683
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:50,120
appalling I had multiple calls with

684
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,919
Robbie and Taylor individually and

685
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,240
together and what you're about to hear

686
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,600
is just a few examples from just one of

687
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,440
those calls when Taylor was explaining

688
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,559
her version of the Stephanie story me

689
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,080
and Robbie was chiming

690
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,600
in she she' come for some kind of

691
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,960
program that I can't remember as I told

692
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,760
you I was looking or maybe I didn't tell

693
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,840
you this I can't remember somehow I

694
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,080
can't remember how um and so he called

695
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,519
Stephanie and asked her if she would

696
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,279
handle all that or maybe Anthony's wife

697
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,919
did I can't remember there was something

698
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,120
a dis I can't remember exactly what he

699
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,960
said but the bottom line was he told her

700
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,840
she need to light lay flat and not move

701
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,000
so somehow I managed which I can't even

702
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,000
remember how I had to get a nurse there

703
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,039
to give her blood test and the blood

704
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,640
didn't show up I can't remember but

705
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,519
there was things that were off um I

706
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,120
maybe it was the liver enzymes and you

707
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,559
know I don't know but I don't remember

708
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,559
it's all blur so

709
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,760
um and a lot of it is a blur for me and

710
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,679
I don't remember exactly what you wrote

711
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,840
but at some point you know I was in

712
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,600
touch with him um directly and I don't

713
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,039
know the timeline like again I don't

714
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,519
know the time this is all just a blur to

715
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,360
me what the [ __ ] was it doesn't even

716
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,399
matter all right well whatever but you

717
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,960
know whatever you know whatever fine

718
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:11,120
whatever she had the L okay you know

719
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,600
these things Escape me sometimes um well

720
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,519
escapes me at the moment yeah there was

721
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,440
something

722
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,440
else is it a week I

723
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,919
can't when you take a story to a

724
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,600
mainstream Media company about somebody

725
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,919
who died with the expressed intent of

726
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,919
causing harm to somebody else's

727
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,279
reputation it's all a blur I don't know

728
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't know the timeline these things

729
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:42,840
Escape me sometimes it doesn't matter is

730
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,960
all completely and entirely

731
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,559
unacceptable on calls that I had with

732
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,799
Robbie and Taylor together they were

733
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,360
even arguing with each other about

734
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,279
critical details that they couldn't even

735
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,159
keep straight and that neither one of

736
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,039
them ended up being accurate

737
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,880
about also pause real quick that there

738
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,799
PR all this there was

739
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,279
also where her health was what happened

740
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,640
in this last month was developing for

741
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,039
years okay and there was a time when she

742
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,480
was in LA and you can hear this from Ash

743
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,039
when when you talk to Ash Amber

744
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,120
hopefully you do um her her nipples were

745
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,159
bleeding no no her nipples didn't start

746
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,200
bleeding until she had a lump and she

747
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,360
asked Anthony about the lump and he said

748
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,279
it was okay yeah but this is this is

749
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,480
long before long before exactly but they

750
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,440
didn't start bleeding until she was in

751
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,080
Pennsylvania so she was I don't know ask

752
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,799
whatever fine whatever she had the lump

753
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,399
okay she had the lump

754
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,640
okay there is so much to unpack in just

755
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,159
this audio alone that we're going to do

756
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,399
more thoroughly later on in this series

757
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,279
but basically they're talking about

758
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,039
Stephanie's breast lump Robbie is trying

759
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:51,000
to claim that Stephanie's nipples

760
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,640
started bleeding a year before Stephanie

761
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,200
discovered her breast lump in 2017 and

762
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,399
instead during a time that Stephanie

763
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,679
stayed nights with Ashley in LA in 2016

764
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,440
which doesn't even make sense and is

765
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,080
provably wrong as we unpacked in a

766
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,240
previous episode one of Stephanie's

767
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,039
nipples not both started bleeding on

768
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,840
October 15th of 2017 it's documented in

769
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:17,600
text messages it happened 6 months after

770
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,399
Stephanie discovered her breast lump 6

771
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
months after Anthony and his wife

772
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:24,720
immediately told Stephanie to get her

773
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,600
lump assessed by her physician 6 months

774
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,360
after Stephanie had been telling the

775
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,639
both of them that she was under the care

776
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,760
of a doctor for her breast lump but in

777
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,559
fact was

778
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,519
not Robbie said this though because

779
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,320
Ashley's original false story about

780
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,240
Stephanie included reference to that

781
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,080
short time in

782
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,639
2016 Ashley's told so many fake stories

783
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,320
about Stephanie that he's getting them

784
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:49,919
confused and has no idea what he's

785
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,120
talking about that's why he's saying ask

786
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,440
Ash I hope you talk to Ash Taylor tries

787
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,720
to correct Robbie and says no no no

788
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,639
Stephanie's nipples didn't start

789
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,480
bleeding until after after she had the

790
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:04,039
lump a year after the timeline you're

791
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,159
talking about she was in Pennsylvania

792
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,200
not la which is true but then Taylor

793
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,000
added in a huge falsity that comes

794
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,080
directly and exactly from Ashley's

795
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,679
original false story about Stephanie

796
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,480
that is a lie that we've addressed and

797
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,480
that we're going to debunk even further

798
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,279
in this

799
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,360
series Robbie gets palpably upset that

800
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:27,039
he was challenged by Taylor when he was

801
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
literally wrong about one of the most

802
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,440
basic facts

803
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,919
of the timeline and then they both just

804
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,159
resort to I don't know ask Ash they're

805
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,159
also both saying nipples as in plural

806
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,679
just like Ashley did in her original

807
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,440
false story when really it was only one

808
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,360
nipple that bled even the article

809
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,559
accurately described it as only being

810
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,480
one

811
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:53,880
nipple Taylor and Robbie are both wrong

812
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,639
very wrong they're both referencing

813
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,279
Ashley's story they're both confused

814
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:03,000
they're deferring to Ashley and Ashley

815
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,240
is more wrong than any of them this is

816
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,840
why Ashley's original false story about

817
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,360
Stephanie from 2020 still matters

818
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,440
greatly it is what all of these people

819
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,080
have clearly been brainwashed with all

820
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,440
these years and it is what they're still

821
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,039
going off of to this day in these

822
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,639
upcoming episodes you're going to see

823
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,679
that they've had to manipulate and mold

824
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,720
cherry-picked and otherwise altered

825
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,679
messages to fit what they could try to

826
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,240
piece together from Ashley's original

827
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,440
false storyline while they've hidden all

828
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,559
of the evidence that proves her and them

829
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,120
wrong somehow Ashley has been positioned

830
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,200
by this group as the leader and the

831
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,960
ultimate Authority on

832
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,760
Stephanie as will become extensively

833
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,159
clear in these episodes Ashley is far

834
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,080
from a valid Authority on Stephanie or

835
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,679
really much else for that

836
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,960
matter another individual with a health

837
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,919
business involved with this group is a

838
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,279
woman named Gretchen manzer Gretchen is

839
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,679
the one who you heard saying that there

840
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,399
were statements she had made to the

841
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,080
journalist that she didn't fully stand

842
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,560
behind

843
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,079
100% Gretchen is also the one who you

844
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,079
heard commenting on how strange it was

845
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,159
that what suddenly turned Robbie against

846
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,560
Anthony years and years after Stephanie

847
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,560
passed away was when he suddenly watched

848
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,800
the documentary that Ashley's husband

849
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,720
was the cinematographer for which was

850
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,560
about a fugitive and an ex con who

851
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,200
committed actual crimes and had nothing

852
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,879
to do with

853
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,599
Anthony it was funny when Robbie had

854
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,839
like the realization after she met we're

855
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,440
like welcome Robbie like where have you

856
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:44,720
been you know but yeah it's so weird how

857
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,359
for him it just like it's like the Click

858
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,280
of a finger you know did you watch that

859
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,599
documentary I did yeah yeah um but I I

860
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,720
heard that like Sarma feels really

861
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,359
misrepresented like she doesn't feel

862
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,960
like that it was

863
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,280
how she wanted her story to be told yeah

864
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,960
interesting um yeah but it's so funny

865
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:13,599
how he watched that and

866
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,400
then like it just all clicked into

867
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,680
place as you just heard again this was a

868
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,960
documentary they expressed using as a

869
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,320
model for what they wanted to do to

870
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,240
Anthony and Gretchen says here that the

871
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,960
very documentary they revered as a model

872
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,200
is one that a main subject feels really

873
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,119
misrepresented by as Gretchen was

874
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,240
telling me her version of the Stephanie

875
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,200
story she admitted that it was hard for

876
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,800
her to keep all of the facts and

877
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,160
timelines

878
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,880
straight and

879
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,119
um it just it just took me so long and

880
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,599
sorry the story is kind of it's just so

881
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,480
many layers and components and timelines

882
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,040
and it's hard to get it all

883
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,240
straight during my calls with this group

884
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,960
that Robbie organized and prompted me to

885
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,079
engage him by the way not the other way

886
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,359
around Robbie was so boastful about this

887
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,480
plot and what he had done that he was

888
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,960
just spewing information and divulging

889
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,920
details to me left and right completely

890
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,240
unprovoked one of the details he

891
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,880
divulged was a ranked list he spouted

892
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,480
off of who in the group was most

893
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,599
responsible for the Vanity Fair hit

894
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,319
piece I I will definitely take

895
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,079
responsibility for one I've been one of

896
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:28,160
the people that's been pushing for this

897
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,319
if you want to take the list people of

898
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,160
why this article's coming out and why

899
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:36,280
it's coming out in a um mainstream

900
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,400
publication is number one Ash is the

901
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,680
number one responsible I would be number

902
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,640
two Tony would be number three and Megan

903
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,680
would be number four it was us four who

904
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,680
like decided this needs to

905
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,119
happen as you just heard Robbie named

906
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,079
Tony as the number three person

907
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,839
responsible for the plot Tony is

908
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,800
Stephanie's brother Tony has admitted

909
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,760
that he's in charge of Stephanie's phone

910
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,319
and he's therefore responsible for all

911
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,119
of the content that has been manipulated

912
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:08,599
Twisted hidden and otherwise distorted

913
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,040
to try to frame Anthony and coordinate

914
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,760
with Ashley's original false

915
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,079
story for example you're going to learn

916
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,640
in this series that Dan Adler the

917
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,839
journalist spent an entire year writing

918
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,079
about Stephanie based on what was said

919
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,000
and provided to him by Tony and the

920
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:28,079
other plotters yet Dan did not know that

921
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Anthony and his wife had texted

922
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,079
Stephanie and said that she should

923
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,960
always see a physician for her breast

924
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,640
lump right away the very next day right

925
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,800
after Stephanie first discovered her

926
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,960
lump in March of

927
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,520
2017 Dan remains completely unaware of

928
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,319
this critical text message that in and

929
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,640
of itself disproved the narrative the

930
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:52,480
plotter sold him on all throughout his

931
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,440
writing process as was reflected in

932
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,839
Dan's initial questions to Anthony there

933
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,240
is documented evidence that Dan was

934
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,160
entirely unaware of this critical text

935
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,520
message as well as a lot of other

936
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,520
critical evidence that should have been

937
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,440
on Stephanie's phone for a whole year

938
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,800
all the way up until Dan first reached

939
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,880
out to Anthony about the article and

940
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,560
Anthony had to be the one to inform him

941
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,119
but Dan didn't reach out for Anthony's

942
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,520
side until right before Dan was planning

943
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,440
on publishing his hit piece and had

944
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,319
already formed the story Anthony had to

945
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,560
be the one to inform Dan that he had the

946
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,839
entire narrative wrong and was missing

947
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,480
critical evidence but only had the

948
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,720
opportunity to do so in response to Dan

949
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,880
sending Anthony hundreds and hundreds of

950
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,800
clearly biased questions with a deadline

951
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:45,079
of five days to respond to after Dan had

952
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,920
already invested a year of his time into

953
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,880
the other side and their false

954
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,760
story there's a good chance that most

955
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,280
likely Dan would have dropped the

956
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,040
article if he knew earlier on that the

957
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,560
day after Stephanie found the breast

958
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,079
lump that my wife and I told Stephanie

959
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,160
that she should always see a physician

960
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,720
if Dan knew this it would have been a

961
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,920
shocker because he was also told the

962
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,560
same old Ashley lie which was that I

963
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,960
never told Steph to see a doctor but Dan

964
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,680
was too deep into the article too much

965
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,680
time and money had been invested and Dan

966
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,720
was buried in Ashley Foster's falsities

967
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,160
and lies and everybody had a save face

968
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,880
and just put an article

969
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,800
out and that doesn't even scratch the

970
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,000
surface of what Tony is culpable for

971
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,599
hiding and distorting in efforts to

972
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,040
rewrite history portray a narrative that

973
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,920
doesn't exist in reality and frame

974
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,160
Anthony to get a documentary deal all of

975
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,200
which is going to be thoroughly exposed

976
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,880
in this series Tony is the one you heard

977
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,359
Robbie insulting and describing as being

978
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,119
lowc

979
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,760
conscious Tony might be tough because

980
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:01,000
he's he's a he's not a he's not a uh

981
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,560
conscious I wouldn't say as an involved

982
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Soul as we

983
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,040
are Robbie also describe Tony as not

984
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,480
being

985
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,280
levelheaded Tony Tony could be a little

986
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,480
bit more on the edge he might not be so

987
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,760
levelheaded but everybody else have

988
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,520
levelheaded if the plotters are saying

989
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,440
that Tony is not levelheaded that's

990
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,040
really saying

991
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,400
something next up is a woman named Megan

992
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,720
Elizabeth who Robbie identified as being

993
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,960
the number four person most responsible

994
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,800
for this plot Megan outed Tony for

995
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,400
having multiple fake accounts that he

996
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,960
uses to stalk and spy on the medical

997
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,920
medium

998
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,880
Community it's interesting to see how

999
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,520
his inner circle handles it too like I'm

1000
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,400
not always paying attention to that

1001
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,880
stuff but Tony has

1002
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,680
like other profiles that he's in these

1003
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,800
groups and he watches what they're

1004
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,119
saying we have since observed this group

1005
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,680
using fake accounts to try to influence

1006
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,640
public opinion spread lies across the

1007
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,200
internet and make it look like they have

1008
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,119
more support than they actually do this

1009
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,440
is far from the behavior of honest

1010
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,319
people with an honest story to tell

1011
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,760
Megan also outed Tony for constantly

1012
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:19,119
watching Anthony and wanting to take

1013
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,839
Anthony

1014
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,720
down I mean

1015
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,400
there

1016
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:31,240
yeah I mean Tony's like

1017
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,640
he's been Relentless about this like

1018
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,280
since stuff passed like just you know we

1019
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,520
have to do something about this and he's

1020
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,040
constantly watching Anthony

1021
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,359
and just grabbing every little bit of

1022
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,640
information that he thinks could be

1023
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,640
helpful to take him

1024
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,119
down and Megan is also the one you heard

1025
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,520
in previous episodes saying we need to

1026
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,880
get this guy off the internet and just

1027
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,200
take it all

1028
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,359
down holy [ __ ] we need to get this guy

1029
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,119
off the internet like we need to just

1030
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,880
take it all

1031
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,319
down Megan has been working with Tony on

1032
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,640
this for a long time trying to use

1033
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,920
cherry-picked contents on a deceased

1034
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,599
person's phone who's no longer here to

1035
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,359
speak for herself so that they can craft

1036
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,599
false story lines that frame Anthony

1037
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,720
when we spoke last year Megan claimed to

1038
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,040
have seen everything on Stephanie's

1039
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,440
phone I've listened to her entire phone

1040
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,319
listen to all their voice messages back

1041
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,240
and

1042
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:34,440
forth yet when Megan described her

1043
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,119
version of the Stephanie story to me I

1044
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,400
really listened with an open mind and

1045
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,319
wanted to understand where she was

1046
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,640
coming from but it quickly became

1047
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,359
abundantly clear that Megan just like

1048
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,000
the rest of this hateful group had no

1049
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,240
idea what she was talking about she was

1050
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,839
wishy-washy and confused about every

1051
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,160
detail and she even got the most basic

1052
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,200
key facts of the story

1053
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,599
wrong I can't remember if it was skin

1054
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,319
stuff or what it was yeah um I don't

1055
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,520
know that she really ever went to see a

1056
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,720
doctor when she started working with

1057
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,960
Anthony

1058
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,079
see I can't remember if he recommended

1059
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,599
the chiropractor or if she suggested it

1060
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,240
and then it never turned out or

1061
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,280
something

1062
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,000
um I'm trying to

1063
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,880
remember I think so when it was just a

1064
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,599
back

1065
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,240
injury

1066
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,960
um I'm trying to remember if there was

1067
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,839
like any push for a doctor at that point

1068
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,599
um I can't remember if it was the same

1069
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:38,480
um can't remember the other people okay

1070
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,599
so I can't remember this woman's name um

1071
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,640
but I don't I don't remember exactly

1072
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:45,640
what it was um definitely Taylor all the

1073
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,559
time I don't know how much she was

1074
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,079
keeping up with Robie at the time Taylor

1075
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,599
like I don't know if she flew out there

1076
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,480
right away or what happened but I didn't

1077
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,480
know what that name I didn't know

1078
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,440
recognize the name and I don't know if

1079
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,400
stuff was on that call I don't know if

1080
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,839
she was saying he's saying it's not true

1081
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,119
or she was saying it was not true as

1082
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,680
you're going through the timeline

1083
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,280
of of everyone's story there's so much

1084
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,920
happening and it's hard to keep track of

1085
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,920
what happened

1086
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,520
when there is so much wrong with all of

1087
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:19,400
this too it's ridiculous Stephanie was

1088
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,880
not working with Anthony as a client

1089
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,839
first of all the most concerning thing

1090
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,640
here is Megan saying that she doesn't

1091
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:30,200
know if Stephanie saw a doctor when

1092
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,599
there is evidence all over Stephanie's

1093
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,160
text threads demonstrating that while

1094
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,760
Stephanie made the decision to avoid

1095
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,599
seeing a doctor for her breast lump even

1096
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,920
after Anthony and his wife repeatedly

1097
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,680
encouraged her to do so Stephanie was

1098
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,800
seeing multiple doctors for her back

1099
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,000
injury and other concurrent health

1100
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,599
problems it's one of the most key facts

1101
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,160
of the entire story for somebody who

1102
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,359
said that they've seen everything on

1103
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,640
Stephanie's phone that level of

1104
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,920
ignorance is highly problematic IC as a

1105
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,760
reminder my recorded call with Megan and

1106
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,040
my recorded calls with the other sources

1107
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,559
for the article took place after the

1108
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,240
article had already been written and

1109
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,640
right before it was

1110
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,559
published at that stage the article was

1111
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,200
already done and they still couldn't get

1112
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,680
anything right they got every key fact

1113
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,880
so painfully and provably wrong Megan

1114
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,520
like Gretchen at least admitted that she

1115
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,480
was confused and that all of the

1116
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,359
different text threads and timelines

1117
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,559
were hard for her to keep track of how

1118
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:35,160
dare you be that uncertain on what

1119
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,760
happened with Stephanie yet so sure that

1120
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,520
all the work that Anthony has done to

1121
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,000
help and support the chronically ill for

1122
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,599
decades should be taken down how dare

1123
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,760
you take a story that you're that

1124
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,839
uncertain about and text messages that

1125
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,359
you admittedly don't even understand or

1126
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,040
have organized to a media company to

1127
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:55,280
smear someone a story that they

1128
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,839
admittedly had to hammer into the head

1129
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,280
of the journalist because even he was

1130
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,800
having a hard time wrapping his head

1131
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,280
around a lot of it as Robbie said a

1132
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,680
story that they had to biasedly shape by

1133
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,839
pointing him here and pointing him there

1134
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,960
and that they had to threaten him to get

1135
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,280
him to publish Megan was right about one

1136
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,960
thing though there is a lot going on

1137
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,280
with all of Stephanie's text threads

1138
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,079
that document what was happening and

1139
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,680
that is why we're going to be here for a

1140
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,559
long time unpacking it all factually and

1141
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,200
all of the other data that we have Tony

1142
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,319
has had access to Stephanie's phone

1143
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,920
since before she passed away in 2018 and

1144
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,920
now for nearly 6 years since Megan has

1145
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,800
been a part of this with Tony and has

1146
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,280
had access to the phone again for a long

1147
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,040
long time there is no excuse for any of

1148
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,720
the plotters being as ignorant as they

1149
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,880
are still to this day to the facts and

1150
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,079
the evidence we've now spent the past

1151
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,960
year doing the homework that this group

1152
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:59,079
was not willing to do to get it right

1153
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,760
it's so quick and easy to hurl out lies

1154
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,359
and misinformation to cherry-pick and

1155
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,160
misappropriate text messages and to say

1156
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:08,079
what you feel like about somebody

1157
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,599
whereas it takes a lot of time and

1158
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,920
energy to be factually correct to get it

1159
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,720
right and to prove this unbelievably

1160
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,880
diluted hateful group wrong with

1161
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,920
evidence but we are going to do it time

1162
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,400
and time again as often as we need

1163
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,559
to of course when people pass away

1164
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,160
sometimes there are loved ones who have

1165
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,680
a hard time accepting what really

1166
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,559
happened and want to find someone to

1167
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,880
blame in fact there's a documented

1168
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,119
record of one of the plotters admitting

1169
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,599
in years past that they believed this

1170
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,520
whole thing to stem from Tony looking

1171
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:46,200
for someone to blame but there's no

1172
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,119
excuse for manipulating and hiding

1173
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,960
evidence to try to rewrite history frame

1174
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,200
someone and smear them online and in the

1175
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,960
media and none of this would have played

1176
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,319
out this way or have been taken this far

1177
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,839
if it weren't for Ashley and

1178
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,839
Robbie so let me to

1179
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:12,839
you and to be honest um again 100%

1180
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,079
transparent Ash and I in being the two

1181
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,839
people that taught like Tony and Megan

1182
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:20,319
had with the [ __ ] right the whole

1183
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,520
podcast thing was just dumb so dumb um

1184
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,040
we had to kind of like educate them and

1185
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,839
convince them he this is a better route

1186
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,880
to go and then just text with us four

1187
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:31,800
kind of funny back in the day but

1188
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,960
anyways um the intention and action I

1189
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,359
had is that it's going a Netflix series

1190
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,280
like bad vegan will be made about

1191
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,040
Anthony and it will be a [ __ ] hit

1192
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,920
because what he pulled off is

1193
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,799
unbelievable I the celebrity angle like

1194
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,160
this thing this Netflix version is gonna

1195
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:55,799
go boners it's gonna take many many

1196
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,880
years to get there I mean I mean to to

1197
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,200
produce like that tastes years but it'll

1198
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,480
still be just like the bad Deegan thing

1199
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,760
like how many years ago did that whole

1200
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,079
thing actually happened versus like when

1201
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,520
the the movie came out or the or the

1202
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:13,400
Netflix came out like this is this gonna

1203
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,760
happen holy

1204
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,359
[ __ ] there's going to be a documentary

1205
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,240
about it all that's our vision I mean

1206
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,880
it's not we first get to publish the

1207
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,160
article and then once the article is

1208
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,960
published then people start bidding on

1209
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:33,319
the piece so just you know again um I

1210
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,880
guess um The Hills article I just sent

1211
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:39,799
you yeah is being made into a

1212
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,440
documentary okay so Dan Adler and this

1213
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:45,480
whole whole Vanity Fair people they have

1214
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:48,040
a history of producing something that is

1215
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:52,319
you know well done you know done well

1216
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:55,440
enough to um be turned into um a

1217
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,680
documentary of some sort holy [ __ ] he's

1218
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,160
GNA look real bad it's going to look

1219
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,160
real

1220
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,960
bad this is what they tried to recruit

1221
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,119
me with the promise of a big Netflix

1222
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,319
documentary

1223
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,520
deal these main plotters have recruited

1224
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:15,359
others to join them over the years and

1225
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,640
there are other individuals involved

1226
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,799
that will be exposed throughout this

1227
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,440
series and then we have Dan Adler who

1228
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,960
really should be called a plotter too at

1229
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,119
this point because we have so much

1230
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,559
evidence that we're going to release of

1231
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:31,440
just how deeply he was in cahoots with

1232
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,599
this group Dan is the writer at Vanity

1233
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,079
Fair that the plotter specifically

1234
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,720
sought out to do this hit piece with the

1235
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,760
premeditated goal from day one of It

1236
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,000
ultimately leading to a documentary deal

1237
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,839
for them on June 1st of last year a

1238
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,440
couple weeks after the article and our

1239
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:52,680
podcast episodes came out Dan Adler did

1240
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,520
a very unusual very brief 21-minute

1241
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,119
interview as a guest on a small podcast

1242
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,839
that sole Focus us is criticizing and

1243
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,160
disparaging people in the health and

1244
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,799
wellness industry further proving Dan's

1245
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:09,599
bias shockingly again after the article

1246
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:11,920
was published Dan admitted in this

1247
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,520
interview that he was confused about

1248
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,160
everything he had written about

1249
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,240
regarding

1250
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,559
Anthony but I think one thing that also

1251
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,720
came across in the text messages that I

1252
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,839
reported on and many of the

1253
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,400
conversations I had with sources is that

1254
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,200
a lot of it is just very confusing

1255
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,319
there's a lot of information being

1256
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,160
conveyed there's a lot of jargon being

1257
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,559
used there are lots of supplements

1258
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,799
talking to sources about their

1259
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,000
interpretation of the information more

1260
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:38,040
than anything else I think there's just

1261
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,400
a lot of confusion there's a lot of the

1262
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,559
sense of if I could just understand

1263
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,520
what's being conveyed through this

1264
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,400
figure who's portraying himself as as I

1265
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,280
say in the story just under God I could

1266
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,599
just understand what the message is that

1267
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,079
would help me but when you try to look

1268
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:55,079
at what the message is it's very very

1269
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,079
murky

1270
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,040
that is

1271
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,920
something from a journalist first I from

1272
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,799
a journalist exactly from the journalist

1273
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,319
that had already written the piece he's

1274
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:09,200
confused about everything and first I

1275
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,040
have to address what Dan said in here

1276
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,680
about how he wrote in his hit piece that

1277
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:18,559
Anthony portrays himself to be just

1278
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,599
under God Anthony has absolutely never

1279
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,240
said that he is just under God and he

1280
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,839
does not portray himself in that way

1281
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,839
that is an Ashley Foster talking point

1282
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,280
that she has been misappropriating and

1283
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,400
mischaracterizing Anthony with for years

1284
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,400
to serve her own agenda clearly that

1285
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,440
must have been one of the many things

1286
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,280
that Ashley and Robbie had to give Dan

1287
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,040
Direction on and Hammer into his head as

1288
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,520
that is not something that Anthony has

1289
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,720
ever said or published not once

1290
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,000
apparently Dan didn't properly research

1291
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,280
or fact check his work and just adopted

1292
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,680
provably false narratives from this

1293
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,799
group

1294
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,640
secondly he said that what he was

1295
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:01,720
reporting on was just very confusing and

1296
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,319
he thinks there's just a lot of

1297
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,400
confusion yeah Dan your sources were

1298
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,720
confused and that's why it was confusing

1299
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,640
to you too and they were confused

1300
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,880
because they didn't know the story of

1301
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,799
what really happened and because Ashley

1302
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,599
Foster has been lying about it so much

1303
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:20,520
since day one and if what was being

1304
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,880
presented to Dan seemed that murky and

1305
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,440
was really all that confusing why on

1306
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,440
Earth would he go through with

1307
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,720
publishing an article on a story that he

1308
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,160
was that unclear on or at least why on

1309
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,119
Earth spend a whole year writing a story

1310
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,799
you're uncertain about and then only

1311
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,640
reach out to Anthony after it's already

1312
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:40,440
been

1313
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,359
formed I would imagine that to be

1314
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,079
because Dan like many journalists these

1315
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:48,200
days was not really interested in the

1316
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,960
truth so you've got this crazy toxic and

1317
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,079
unprecedented combination of a brother

1318
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,640
who's looking for someone to blame

1319
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,799
sources who don't even know what

1320
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,960
happened admittedly can't keep track of

1321
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:01,079
the timeline and don't have their fact

1322
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,400
straight you've got a journalist who's

1323
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,240
admittedly confused and still to this

1324
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,400
day doesn't even understand the subject

1325
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,760
matter he wrote about sources and a

1326
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,400
journalist that are all relying on

1327
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,960
Ashley Foster as the ultimate Authority

1328
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,119
on Stephanie when Ashley as you'll learn

1329
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,799
in the series was not around for what

1330
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,760
happened with Stephanie at all

1331
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,599
admittedly barely even spoke to

1332
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,200
Stephanie during the time period that

1333
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,359
this is all about in 2017 has been

1334
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,359
caught flat out lying about Stephanie

1335
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:34,160
and the original conjured up story

1336
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:36,880
Ashley posted that they're all still

1337
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,440
running with to this day had dozens of

1338
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,200
verifiable falsities in it including the

1339
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,920
one you heard Robbie and Taylor repeat

1340
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,799
and that's why Ashley scrubbed it from

1341
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,760
the internet when she got a legal letter

1342
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:49,599
in

1343
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,520
2020 you've got a journalist who was

1344
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,839
somehow conveniently unaware of the text

1345
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,760
messages that were on Stephanie's phone

1346
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:59,119
that disproved the entire narrative he

1347
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,079
was sold on for the whole year he spent

1348
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,200
writing his story you've got sources

1349
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,400
that expressly want to take Anthony down

1350
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,720
have a vested interest in being part of

1351
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,079
getting a Netflix documentary deal

1352
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,799
sources that also have other documented

1353
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,880
ulterior motives that are going to be

1354
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:18,799
uncovered for the first time in these

1355
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,000
episodes a journalist that has a vested

1356
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:24,480
interest in securing a big Netflix

1357
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,240
documentary deal using his story sources

1358
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,440
who admitted to shaping the article

1359
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,720
themselves by giving the journalist a

1360
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,440
lot of direction for the piece having to

1361
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,200
hammer their narrative into his head

1362
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,720
Point him here and point him there and

1363
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:45,319
threaten him to get him to publish it if

1364
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:48,880
there were ever a perfect recipe for

1365
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:51,359
corruption and dishonesty this would be

1366
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,119
it again this is one of the biggest

1367
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,079
scandals that has ever happened in the

1368
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,920
health industry this group has been

1369
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:01,119
using abusing and exploiting Stephanie's

1370
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,119
name and Legacy as a means to an end

1371
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,280
this was certainly never about the truth

1372
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,880
for them if you're confused you do not

1373
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,559
get to fill in the gaps as you want to

1374
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,839
if you can't get the facts or the

1375
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,160
timeline straight you're not in a valid

1376
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:17,880
position to tell a story let alone to

1377
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,680
take it to a media company if you're

1378
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,520
unaware of even the most basic key facts

1379
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,599
of what really happened you have

1380
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,440
absolutely no business perpetuating a

1381
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,280
story that you don't understand

1382
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,799
they tried to get away with lying and

1383
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,599
getting it wrong using Anthony's name

1384
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,880
they try to get away with lying and

1385
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,880
getting it wrong using Stephanie's name

1386
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,480
to serve their own agenda because she's

1387
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,920
not here to speak for herself they try

1388
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,000
to get away with grossly misrepresenting

1389
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,079
medical medium and the community to

1390
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,319
serve their own agenda and none of it is

1391
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,359
going to stand lies inaccurate

1392
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:57,000
information plotting and scheming will

1393
00:56:54,359 --> 00:57:00,160
only ever get you so far

1394
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,880
and the full actual truth is coming out

1395
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,000
in this

1396
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,920
series so Dan the journalist published

1397
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,720
his hit piece we came out with our first

1398
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,000
few podcast episodes that began the

1399
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,559
process of exposing the corruption and

1400
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,520
collusion that took place between the

1401
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,880
media company and the plotters an we

1402
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,920
began to expose the plotter ulterior

1403
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,720
motives their goal from the beginning

1404
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,480
was not to Simply put their version of a

1405
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,720
story out there that they beli to be

1406
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,319
true their goal was categorically to

1407
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:33,520
take medical medium and the community

1408
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,599
down the response to the podcasts was

1409
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,319
massive and I just want to issue a huge

1410
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,960
thank you to everyone for all of the

1411
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:41,599
support we have received through all of

1412
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,240
the craziness so many people were

1413
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,119
devastated by the fact that the plotters

1414
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,400
could be so intentionally poisonous to

1415
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,520
go so low as to use a manipulated story

1416
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,640
of a deceased woman to try to injure a

1417
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,119
community of people who were just trying

1418
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,200
to heal I read through many comments

1419
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,760
from people who were shocked and

1420
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,319
outraged by the voices they recognized

1421
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,000
as being behind this the fact that

1422
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:10,920
something so dark is coming from people

1423
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,240
who portray themselves to be very

1424
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,960
different there were also a lot of

1425
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,880
people who came forward to share their

1426
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,280
own experiences with the plotters one of

1427
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,720
them is a woman named Melody Pence who

1428
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,000
has been applying medical medium

1429
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,400
information for several years and knew

1430
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,440
some of the plotters personally

1431
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,720
following the release of our first ever

1432
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,480
podcast about this group Melody took to

1433
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,839
her Instagram stories to share about

1434
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,559
attempts that were made to recruit her

1435
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:40,799
including even before Ashley came out

1436
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:43,960
with her original false story in

1437
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:46,280
2020 so when I listened to the podcast I

1438
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,960
could not believe what I was hearing as

1439
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,839
you guys could not believe what you were

1440
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:54,400
hearing either and what I recognized

1441
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:56,839
right away was Robbie barbaro's voice so

1442
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,480
clear I mean it's a voice that

1443
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:00,559
um if you know him if you talk to him if

1444
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,119
you've been around him you're going to

1445
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,160
pick up on his voice it's a very

1446
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:08,359
distinctive voice and what I knew Robbie

1447
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:11,240
as is someone who is very charismatic on

1448
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:14,359
the outside seemed like a pure genuine

1449
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:17,920
soul to me I looked up to him I thought

1450
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:21,039
he was an amazing person um and so when

1451
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,039
I heard him talking like that on the

1452
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,880
medical

1453
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:28,200
medium uh podcast that Anthony just

1454
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:31,640
released I I saw his true colors and it

1455
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,880
was shocking it was shocking to realize

1456
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:37,039
that someone that you thought um was a

1457
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,280
good person and had so much Prisma on

1458
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,680
the outside and portrayed that they

1459
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:44,119
wanted to help others is not like that

1460
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,160
honestly it was it was so shocking that

1461
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:51,079
it took me like a full day to like

1462
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:54,079
recover from that and and um and and and

1463
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:56,400
what's interesting about Robbie is he

1464
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,280
comes off as such a positive vibe been

1465
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,079
wanting to help people but something

1466
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:07,799
that I brought up um in my last stories

1467
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:09,559
was when I met Robbie in gosh 2016 I'm

1468
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:15,240
not sure when it was when Anthony did

1469
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:17,599
his event in LA and um and I uh I was

1470
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,039
there I got interviewed by Robbie and I

1471
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:23,680
remember he told me at one point he said

1472
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,240
um you know just focus on the food focus

1473
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:29,079
on the food and it's like when he said

1474
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,160
that I felt a lack of compassion because

1475
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:34,160
I he had just interviewed me about my

1476
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,599
story the strugg struggles I'd been

1477
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,359
through um and you know I had a lot of

1478
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,720
failures a lot of heartbreak and then to

1479
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:44,240
hear just focus on the food to just

1480
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:47,119
focus on the food for my Instagram right

1481
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,520
that I pretty sure that's that's exactly

1482
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,119
what he was saying like he didn't he

1483
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,799
didn't really just he didn't want to

1484
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,960
hear about like someone's struggles or

1485
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:59,720
pain exactly was just like yeah focus on

1486
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,119
the food which is crazy cuz that's not

1487
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,880
even what the chronically ill is about

1488
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,039
and he does help chronically ill people

1489
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,839
he helps people with diabetes you know

1490
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:15,119
and so right there is just a red flag of

1491
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:18,960
lacking compass and also speaking of um

1492
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:21,000
this Elite group right um and being

1493
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,799
recruited that they talk about in the

1494
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,839
video my nose is just so bad right now

1495
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:31,480
but um um I I remember right let's see

1496
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:34,920
when shortly after he moved to Miami in

1497
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,640
2020 when Co happened I all of a sudden

1498
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,640
like noticed that he was watching my

1499
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,240
stories and I was like why like that's

1500
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,039
weird like we follow each other but um

1501
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,480
he never communicates with me I don't

1502
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,839
communicate with him and then all of a

1503
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,960
sudden one day he was just watching my

1504
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:54,000
stories a lot then I get a DM from him

1505
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:57,920
completely unexpected and it basically

1506
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,240
is inviting me to go to Miami and stay

1507
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,839
at his house that he has a guest bedroom

1508
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,079
blah blah blah um this and that and I

1509
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:07,119
was just like hm that's weird and in my

1510
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:09,920
gut feeling at that time I was like well

1511
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:13,160
this isn't a romantic interest like what

1512
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,240
does he want you know what I mean and

1513
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,039
and now looking back it all makes sense

1514
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,760
it all makes sense that they were

1515
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:23,400
recruiting people um someone dm' me

1516
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,160
yesterday and said that uh they did his

1517
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,440
program and that they've been around him

1518
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,440
before and that he always has females

1519
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,760
coming in and out of his house he's

1520
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,000
always surrounded by females and it's

1521
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:38,839
that's odd right thank God I didn't go

1522
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,400
and um but now I realize it it could

1523
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:43,119
have been because he was trying to

1524
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,640
recruit me and turn me against mm which

1525
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:50,039
would never happen so I found out about

1526
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:54,440
Ashley Foster through um one I just I

1527
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:57,079
knew that things were getting weird with

1528
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,960
this group and I'm about to go into this

1529
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:03,520
um Ashley's

1530
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:07,640
group and like a couple years ago um

1531
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,680
gosh in 2018 when I moved back to Hawaii

1532
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:13,680
um Gretchen lived there she invited me

1533
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:16,039
over um I didn't I don't think I

1534
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,359
realized before I went to her house how

1535
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,480
against mm she was I was just going

1536
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:23,279
there to like meet a familiar face cuz

1537
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,359
Gretchen was a part of reclaimers of

1538
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:29,200
Health in 2016

1539
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:32,160
17 so I still thought maybe oh maybe

1540
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,000
like she's still doing mm you know

1541
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,039
whatever so anyways I go to her house

1542
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,559
and she tries to she talks to me about

1543
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:44,240
how bad Anthony is how bad mm is and

1544
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:47,400
basically trying to turn me against mm

1545
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,960
well I never saw her again after that we

1546
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,160
lived on the same island I I never

1547
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,319
contacted her nothing it was just such a

1548
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,079
turn off to me and the other thing that

1549
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:59,319
she was talking about was Ashley and

1550
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:02,160
basically referring to Ashley as if

1551
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:04,760
she's some type of idol some type of God

1552
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,520
because Gretchen worshiped her I mean

1553
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,400
she did sorry Gretchen if you're seeing

1554
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:12,559
this but you did and like everything

1555
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,880
Ashley did was amazing and and and

1556
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,079
Ashley was the one that had a heavy

1557
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,319
influence on

1558
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:22,480
Gretchen and made Gretchen like really

1559
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,680
not like mm so much so what does that

1560
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,279
say and here now we're seeing her

1561
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,920
resurface and a couple years ago

1562
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:32,319
Ashley's Instagram got shut down because

1563
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,880
she was blaming Anthony for her friend's

1564
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:40,680
death um verbally announcing it on

1565
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:46,319
Instagram and everything and and now she

1566
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:50,760
is and what's crazy is Ashley um was at

1567
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:53,480
the um the mm event in La the same T

1568
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,119
place I met Robbie I knew they were good

1569
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,920
friends cuz they just stuck to each

1570
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:01,079
other and hung out together the entire

1571
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:04,359
time Ashley's husband was doing the

1572
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,960
video for interviewing people he was the

1573
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:10,119
cameraman when he when Robbie

1574
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:13,039
interviewed me okay and so this is just

1575
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:16,480
comes full circle you know what I mean

1576
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:19,799
um o my blood's starting to boil so

1577
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:22,760
anyways um also in the p real quick in

1578
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:25,200
the podcast they talk about how they

1579
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,760
have someone that can do the video well

1580
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,680
guess who you think that is I mean I'm

1581
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,720
just speaking for my own intuition here

1582
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:35,640
but come on like I'm sure it's her

1583
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:38,720
husband recording for the documentary I

1584
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:42,079
don't know but that's thing and I

1585
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:44,599
remember when I saw Ashley I was excited

1586
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,599
to meet her cuz she had a lot of what

1587
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:51,319
seemed like light about her she was

1588
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:53,039
Smiley happy just seemed so like nice

1589
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:58,119
but then what I realized is when I met

1590
01:05:53,039 --> 01:06:01,400
her excuse me um she like really didn't

1591
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:03,240
hardly even say hi to me anything I mean

1592
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,720
and then I realized she's like that with

1593
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,520
her friends she's like that with her

1594
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,960
friends cuz I was like Oh I thought she

1595
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,720
was so nice like okay and then I just

1596
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,279
see her with her circle of friends and I

1597
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,520
was like hm and that was my f that was

1598
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:18,119
my first

1599
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:21,799
impression but she will play the victim

1600
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:23,880
card very well very well so don't get

1601
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:27,720
fooled by who knows who the three

1602
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:30,839
younger recruits are h M so who knows

1603
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,920
but um I wanted to share everything with

1604
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:35,200
y'all and I'm not done yet but I wanted

1605
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,520
to share everything with y'all so you

1606
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,920
could gather the information too and

1607
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,920
just see like okay what's going on here

1608
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:47,160
you know

1609
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:48,799
and and uh during that time is just when

1610
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,720
I started realizing there was a whole

1611
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:54,440
bunch of group of people against mm um

1612
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,039
simply because who knows why they're not

1613
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,760
happy

1614
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,200
so Robbie's in the on the podcast and

1615
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,920
then of course ra

1616
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:06,039
Christina um she says The Parting of the

1617
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,440
Red Seas that is

1618
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:14,160
disgusting that is disgusting she is

1619
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:16,920
someone who preaches spiritualism who

1620
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,839
preaches peace and love and happiness

1621
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,920
and healing and health and then she's

1622
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:25,119
behind this directly orchestrating how

1623
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,079
she's going to take down mm are you

1624
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:32,039
kidding me and the reason I know this is

1625
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:34,400
because if you have followed her if you

1626
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:37,000
have watched many of her YouTube videos

1627
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,839
if you were a follower of her trying to

1628
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,960
heal then you will recognize her voice

1629
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:47,359
when you listen closely so baffling to

1630
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:51,000
me is these people right that

1631
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:54,039
are have high high following numbers

1632
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,279
who's supposed to be what they come off

1633
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:59,799
as to help people get healthy and well

1634
01:07:58,279 --> 01:08:01,680
they want to wipe out the chronically

1635
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:04,440
ill

1636
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,760
community so you want to wipe out people

1637
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:10,079
that you are actually pretending that

1638
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,480
you help so if you're about green juices

1639
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,839
and fruits and vegetables and people

1640
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,560
getting their health back you don't

1641
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:18,319
really care if you're going to try to

1642
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,000
take down an entire

1643
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:25,640
community that is Sinister I've also

1644
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,799
gotten um so many messages from you guys

1645
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:30,319
and some of you guys have said Taylor is

1646
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:32,440
in the video the one that says oh I have

1647
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,279
to do really really bad things to get

1648
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:40,239
here that's three people Robbie

1649
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:43,600
Christina five and either Taylor Britney

1650
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:46,199
or someone else and again this is just

1651
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,839
from what I've seen in my personal

1652
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:51,159
experience who I've talked to personally

1653
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:54,400
how it evolved for me was through

1654
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:58,679
Gretchen um and and yeah since then it's

1655
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,920
just I've had a huge a awareness about

1656
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:04,799
people trying to take down mm because of

1657
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:07,040
what's happened so I hope this clears is

1658
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,159
clears things up and I'm super tired cuz

1659
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:12,480
I have so much brain fog but let me know

1660
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:15,880
okay you guys want to know like what

1661
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:18,000
else I think is so um Sinister about

1662
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,560
this people that are called first of all

1663
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,199
they call themselves Elite so what does

1664
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,719
that tell you you know what I mean the

1665
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:27,920
only person that Elite is Elite to me is

1666
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:31,480
God um in Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit

1667
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:33,520
and that is a huge red flag number one

1668
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:37,120
that they're calling themselves Elite

1669
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:40,239
that's just that should be enough that's

1670
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:42,400
enough for me right there and then the

1671
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,359
thing is is that they're saying oh I had

1672
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,239
to do you have to do bad things to get

1673
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:47,839
into this group and then she's talking

1674
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:50,440
to Amber oh but you didn't have to do

1675
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:52,880
anything and you're here hah and it's

1676
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,679
like what does that sound like yeah that

1677
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,480
sounds like a cult to me that sounds

1678
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:00,239
like um something that you have to be a

1679
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:04,199
part of that's Elite that you have to do

1680
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:08,199
bad things to join and it sounds very

1681
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:10,199
very dark to me what about you you guys

1682
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:13,960
you know honestly what that made me

1683
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:15,719
think of once I got over the shock of

1684
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,280
I'm still in shock of Who's involved

1685
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:22,280
honestly but it's it's just so crystal

1686
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:27,320
clear that um yeah I mean now I know who

1687
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,320
these people are so the shock is lifting

1688
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,640
and then a couple days later after our

1689
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:37,480
second episode came out Melody posted

1690
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:40,800
this but I've been online um and seen

1691
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:43,280
some people like just really talking

1692
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,480
crap about medical medium and it's just

1693
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,000
really not cool it's it's really not

1694
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,920
cool it's

1695
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,960
like I'm going to be straight up and

1696
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,280
because I'm exhausted and I'm just a

1697
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,560
person that doesn't have really a lot of

1698
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:01,760
filter these days cuz I am working my

1699
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:05,199
ass off and I'm fried so here I go um

1700
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,960
but you know people that want to talk

1701
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:10,360
[ __ ] and talk like bad about somebody

1702
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,280
who's doing something amazing have

1703
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:16,040
nothing going on in their lives there's

1704
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,760
a lack of faith on this planet that is

1705
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:22,320
so massive that and so many people have

1706
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,120
trauma and like things that have

1707
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,159
happened to them that they want to blame

1708
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:29,040
someone for and instead of looking

1709
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:32,120
within and like you know fixing their

1710
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,280
own life they have to like try to bring

1711
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:37,400
someone else

1712
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:39,199
down later on in this series more is

1713
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,440
going to be shared about Melody's

1714
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:43,600
experiences which very much align with

1715
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,600
my own experiences with this

1716
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,000
group as the content and evidence from

1717
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,239
all the upcoming episodes unfolds you're

1718
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,080
going to see just how spot-on Melody is

1719
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:57,280
especially about the dynamic of this

1720
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,000
group how they worship and idolize

1721
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,679
Ashley Foster and the influence that

1722
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,320
Ashley specifically has had upon them

1723
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:07,400
turning against medical medium over the

1724
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,600
years and the other thing that she was

1725
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,520
talking about was Ashley and basically

1726
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,480
referring to Ashley as if she's some

1727
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,040
type of idol some type of God because

1728
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,639
Gretchen worshiped her I mean she did

1729
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:22,679
sorry Gretchen if you're seeing this but

1730
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:26,040
you did and like everything Ashley did

1731
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:28,800
was amazing and and and Ashley was the

1732
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:33,159
one that had a heavy influence on

1733
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:35,679
Gretchen and made Gretchen like really

1734
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:38,840
not like mm so

1735
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:42,400
much you're going to see that Ashley has

1736
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:45,159
been lying and plotting and scheming for

1737
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,639
years for ulterior reasons while

1738
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:49,880
pretending to be a

1739
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:53,400
whistleblower Ashley so badly wanted to

1740
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,400
position herself as a leader and a guru

1741
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,440
and get attention for that under the

1742
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:00,639
guise of being an advocate on top of the

1743
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,080
lies and falsi she's already been caught

1744
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,000
telling as well as the many more lies

1745
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,719
and falsities of hers that are going to

1746
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,560
be exposed in these episodes one of the

1747
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:11,960
biggest giveaways that Ashley is

1748
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,800
completely disingenuous is the fact that

1749
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:18,239
she has now spent the entire past year

1750
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,360
relentlessly belittling harassing body

1751
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:23,480
shaming name calling and attacking the

1752
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:26,360
very people she claims to be advocating

1753
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,600
for the chronically ill

1754
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,760
Ashley got sloppy and put her true

1755
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,080
character and intentions on public

1756
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,120
display which is purely to cause harm to

1757
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,199
Anthony and the medical medium community

1758
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,600
and there is no low that she won't stoop

1759
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:43,239
to in her

1760
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:45,520
efforts any journalist or Media company

1761
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:48,360
that takes Ashley Foster and her

1762
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,960
organized hateful group seriously is a

1763
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:55,080
joke and a sham anyone who platforms a

1764
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:57,760
group that is lying spewing hatred

1765
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:00,920
burning books and calling for another

1766
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,360
human being to be exterminated by fire

1767
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,679
is

1768
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:07,000
Despicable and Melody wasn't the only

1769
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,760
one with the story to share a lot of

1770
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,719
people have come forward with all kinds

1771
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,159
of information and evidence which will

1772
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,600
be discussed throughout these upcoming

1773
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:17,960
episodes last year following the release

1774
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,960
of the previous podcast episodes there

1775
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,560
was also something really suspicious

1776
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,199
that occurred immediately after the

1777
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:28,080
episodes were released my computer which

1778
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:31,239
of course had the recordings on it was

1779
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,880
hacked I have never in my life had

1780
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:35,639
anything like that happened prior but

1781
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,600
all of the sudden right after our

1782
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:39,920
podcast started coming out one night I

1783
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,920
was sitting at my desk about a foot away

1784
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,719
from the computer using my phone while

1785
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,000
my desktop computer screen was idle

1786
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,920
suddenly out of the corner of my eye I

1787
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
noticed that something had taken over my

1788
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,679
computer and a bunch of my files were

1789
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,400
being pulled up at lightning speed I

1790
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,960
realized that somebody had hacked into

1791
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:00,440
my computer and was looking through my

1792
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,280
files extremely rapidly my gut reaction

1793
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,600
was to just shut down and unplug the

1794
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,280
computer immediately and thankfully I

1795
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,639
learned later that that's exactly what

1796
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:11,400
you're supposed to do in that situation

1797
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:13,600
as it removes a hacker's access I was

1798
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,639
able to catch and interrupt the attempt

1799
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,320
right

1800
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:20,600
away now hacking into someone's computer

1801
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,239
is obviously not only a privacy

1802
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,600
violation but it's also massively

1803
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:27,159
illegal and it says everything about the

1804
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,440
character and the desperation of the

1805
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:32,560
person who did it or had someone do it

1806
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,480
for them I had to get a new computer and

1807
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,280
I had to replace other devices like my

1808
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,679
phone that were compromised by the

1809
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:41,239
Hacked Wi-Fi and I had to move because I

1810
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,560
no longer felt comfortable living where

1811
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:45,120
I was living I consulted with some

1812
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,159
experts and I was told that you have to

1813
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,320
know someone's location in order to hack

1814
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:51,800
them like that so it easily could have

1815
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,199
happened again can't say for sure who

1816
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,840
did it yet but one of the plotters knew

1817
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,080
where I lived

1818
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,800
I've had Specialists investigating the

1819
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,000
situation and supporting me with

1820
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:05,719
security on my new devices it seems to

1821
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,360
me like someone wanted those recordings

1822
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:10,679
really

1823
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:13,600
badly the recordings serve as critical

1824
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,520
evidence of the identity of the plotters

1825
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,920
because their whole plan was to go

1826
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,239
through with this anonymously and

1827
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,560
conceal their identities so that they

1828
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:25,239
couldn't be held accountable for the

1829
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,440
false information they were using the

1830
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:31,400
media to spread they serve as critical

1831
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:34,360
evidence of the plot's own ranking

1832
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,840
system of the top people who are most

1833
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:40,000
responsible for the plot and the

1834
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,719
recordings serve as critical evidence of

1835
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,520
the malicious intentions behind the

1836
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,040
plotters the verifiably false

1837
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,600
information that they've tried to use to

1838
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,920
recruit people the recruitment tactics

1839
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,480
the verifiably false information they

1840
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,719
fed to the media

1841
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,800
as well as a very serious corruption and

1842
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,199
collusion between the plotters and the

1843
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,080
media company that they sold false

1844
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:08,199
stories too and there's so much more

1845
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,120
from the recordings that we are going to

1846
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:14,080
be

1847
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:16,040
releasing yes and as such Ashley and the

1848
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,600
other plotters did everything that they

1849
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:21,719
could to try to discredit the recordings

1850
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:24,040
and the podcast episodes but it's really

1851
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:26,400
hard to walk yourself out of what you

1852
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,199
said in your own

1853
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,800
words after the podcast came out Ashley

1854
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:33,800
started behaving very erratically she

1855
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,840
kept frantically changing her profile

1856
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,440
over and over again she called Anthony

1857
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:41,239
and I both obnoxious names she kept

1858
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,639
posting and deleting things she issued a

1859
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:47,600
statement that she was quote proud to be

1860
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:49,880
a plotter and then she deleted it Ashley

1861
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,320
then continued on with her pattern of

1862
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:54,360
Simply pivoting when proven wrong she

1863
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,320
started spreading new versions of false

1864
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,800
stories about about Stephanie and other

1865
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,159
plotters followed suit they combined

1866
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,280
their pivoted new and updated false

1867
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:05,000
narratives about Stephanie with other

1868
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,880
types of false information about medical

1869
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,719
medium and the community absolutely

1870
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,840
anything they could piece together and

1871
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,280
fabricate to try to disparage medical

1872
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,440
medium Robbie and Christina were both

1873
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:18,600
reportedly caught deleting comments and

1874
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,199
blocking anyone who recognized their

1875
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,199
voices and asked them about their

1876
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:25,280
involvement with this plot to take

1877
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:27,600
Anthony and the community down numerous

1878
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,480
other individuals have been caught lying

1879
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,400
about their involvement which is going

1880
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,920
to be exposed Ashley even tried to

1881
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,320
Gaslight people by claiming that things

1882
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,040
everyone heard the plotter say very

1883
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,679
clearly that can't mean anything else in

1884
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:45,360
any other context were not said and then

1885
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,080
a couple months after the attempt to

1886
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:51,239
hack into my computer was unsuccessful

1887
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,400
another suspicious event occurred some

1888
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,440
of you may have noticed that our

1889
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,679
previous four podcast episodes came down

1890
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,679
from Apple in the fall of last year

1891
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,679
Ashley Foster instantly started

1892
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:04,719
spreading rumors that they were taken

1893
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,000
down because they contained illegal

1894
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,600
recordings this became her favorite

1895
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:13,000
deflection tactic and false

1896
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,480
claim once Ashley posted a screenshot of

1897
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,159
a message she had gotten that says the

1898
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,480
plot thickens the plotter podcasts from

1899
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:22,840
this year are gone not sure if you knew

1900
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:25,239
that and Ashley

1901
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,239
replied I did yes

1902
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:30,320
they were removed by Apple because they

1903
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:30,320
contained illegal

1904
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,360
recordings this is not true and I'm

1905
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,880
happy to report that the podcast

1906
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,199
episodes became available again on Apple

1907
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:43,480
in January of this year ironically

1908
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:45,400
shortly after Ashley posted this falsity

1909
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:48,280
it's important for everyone to know what

1910
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,960
really happened a law firm whose client

1911
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:53,360
was kept Anonymous filed a strange vague

1912
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,320
claim with apple demanding the podcast

1913
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:58,639
be taken down Apple sent my team an

1914
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,840
email just to alert us of the claim and

1915
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,520
to give us the ability to dispute it

1916
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,800
unfortunately this email somehow went to

1917
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:09,080
spam so my team did not see it in time

1918
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,960
we found out later that Apple has a

1919
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:14,080
policy that they only give you 5 days to

1920
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,639
respond otherwise they just

1921
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,199
automatically remove the content by

1922
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:21,960
default because my team didn't see the

1923
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:25,239
email that is what happened they were

1924
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:28,080
removed by default after 5 days had

1925
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:30,320
passed but this whole time they've

1926
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,120
always remained up on every other

1927
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,440
platform because nothing was actually

1928
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,480
wrong with the episodes it was just a

1929
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,679
fluke that the email alert went to spam

1930
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,080
so we couldn't dispute it in time

1931
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:46,320
anybody can file a claim even if it's

1932
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:48,880
unfounded and inaccurate and if my team

1933
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,960
would have seen the email we would have

1934
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,120
been able to provide evidence to refute

1935
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,679
the claim

1936
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,040
immediately we were very upset when we

1937
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:59,760
realized that the podcast episodes were

1938
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,679
unjustly removed from Apple due to a m

1939
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,360
fluke Apple told us we needed to first

1940
01:21:02,679 --> 01:21:06,679
try and deal with the law firm that

1941
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,440
requested the podcast to be taken down

1942
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:12,760
but that law firm refused to engage with

1943
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,400
us and ignored our Outreach we informed

1944
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,960
apple and then Apple ended up

1945
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:20,040
investigating the claim after this

1946
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,199
thorough investigation Apple concluded

1947
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,600
that there is absolutely nothing wrong

1948
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:27,360
with the podcast episodes and that the

1949
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,400
recordings are in fact legal the

1950
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,320
episodes were restored to Apple in

1951
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,280
January and they all still remain up on

1952
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,440
every other

1953
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:40,840
platform as I've said all along the

1954
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,840
recordings were legally obtained and

1955
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,280
that has now been confirmed by Apple

1956
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,360
itself in its restoration of our

1957
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:51,679
episodes once again Ashley Foster is

1958
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:55,159
wrong and her claims are false even

1959
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,920
Apple itself has now proved Ashley wrong

1960
01:21:55,159 --> 01:22:00,280
Anthony posted about this ridiculous

1961
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:02,840
ordeal in January and one commenter said

1962
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:05,320
hm so who was the anonymous person this

1963
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,239
Law Firm acted on behalf of that's what

1964
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,280
I want to know but there are not many

1965
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:11,560
options are there kind of obvious who

1966
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,080
would go to such lengths to get it taken

1967
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,440
down it seems as though the claim that

1968
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,239
was filed with apple was another attempt

1969
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:20,560
to suppress our ability to defend the

1970
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:23,120
truth and disprove the attacks and the

1971
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,000
false narrative this organized hateful

1972
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:29,080
group is responsible for for but such

1973
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,360
attempts are not going to stand we are

1974
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:34,800
going to continue unraveling their

1975
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:38,080
contrived stories lies tactics

1976
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,199
disinformation and more the behavior

1977
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,040
this organized hateful group has

1978
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:44,280
exhibited which we've only just

1979
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:47,440
scratched the surface of in this episode

1980
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,320
is beyond scandalous I've never

1981
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:52,360
experienced such little regard for the

1982
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:55,480
truth in my life from any individual let

1983
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:57,280
alone a coordinated group of people or

1984
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,480
such little regard for how one's

1985
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:02,520
Behavior impacts other

1986
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:05,080
people unfortunately Ashley Foster and

1987
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:07,679
her hateful group have caused very real

1988
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,920
harm to many people's real lives in

1989
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,320
their pursuit of a documentary deal and

1990
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,320
all of the benefits that would come

1991
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,080
along with that for them at all costs

1992
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,719
and their willingness to just say

1993
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,840
anything to get a rise out of people

1994
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:23,120
using Anthony's name it matters greatly

1995
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,719
to bring attention to this it matters

1996
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,920
greatly for everyone to know what's

1997
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,920
really going on here there are many

1998
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,040
episodes to come and they're not going

1999
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,360
to be able to stop us from defending the

2000
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:37,120
truth some of you may be unaware that

2001
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,320
this has even been happening but many of

2002
