lot of people have ink I respect it I

out there incredible gifted people that

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,079

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
designs and freehand on people's bodies

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,320
body art I'm not against it you know

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,559
it's not that kind of thing this isn't

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,280
an anti- tattoo podcast episode but it's

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
really important because it's an

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,640
important podcast episode about tattoos

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,520
and how to keep your health safe so it

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,399
is really important so I talk about

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,800
toxic heavy metals yes toxic heavy

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,920
metals in your tattoo ink and how there

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,280
is no such thing and I repeat there is

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,479
no such thing as tattoo ink that's metal

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,280
free I repeat so I just hope that gets

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,479
out there and Rings throughout the ether

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,560
and then leaves this planet and then

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,320
heads through the solar system and then

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,479
into the Galaxy and then out out of the

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
Galaxy and into the universe and there

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
forth because it's important to know and

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,600
maybe people on another planet somewhere

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,360
that are doing all this ink and tattoos

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,520
and everything else maybe they'll hear

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,439
it and that will travel all the way to

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,880
that planet and get to them and someone

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,240
will be sitting there maybe by a lake

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,439
and they're going to hear it and it's

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,439
going to be like there's no such thing

41
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,320
as metal free ink there is no such thing

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,479
I want people to know this I don't care

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,840
if it's cruelty-free animal free the

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,119
whole bit listen to this podcast episode

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
it's not about being afraid of your

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,799
tattoo or going to get your tattoo

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,719

49
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:08,520
say in the podcast episode itself don't

so much information really protective

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,760
information too including things to

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
avoid like certain supplementation and

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,560
everything that causes damage to your

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,319

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
these books you guys got to check it out

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,840
seriously you should get that book if

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,280
you don't already have it go to the

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,439
library get get it out of the library if

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,360
you want okay so for instance if you

98
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,200
have a hot spot in your intestinal

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,840
track so if you got a hot spot if you're

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,879
inflamed somewhere in your intestinal

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,519
track if you're inflamed somewhere

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,840
anywhere in here and you eat something

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,799
and it finds its way going down here and

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
it's taking its time and it's going

105
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,239
through right and it finally gets down

106
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,280
to that hot spot and it hits it and now

107
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,840
you're nauseous or you got a pain you're

108
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,199
going to think whoa it was that food

109
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,759
food fear develops very easily because

110
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,759
this this is just one example I'm going

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,000
to cut so much into this information

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,360
you're going to love it you are

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,240
absolutely going to love this

114
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,360
information so if you got a hot spot

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,720
anywhere in your intestinal tract if you

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,479
got a hot spot in your dadum see you got

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,360
a lot of inflammation in your dadum

118
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,919
because you have H pylori or you have an

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,919
old infection that's been fering in

120
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,560
there for 10 years 15 years say you got

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,160
all this extra yeast and mold growing in

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
here you're inflamed because of a virus

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,960
or say like a shinkles virus creating

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,080
colitis or something else see you got

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,360
diagnosed with crohn's whatever it is

126
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,880
that's going on whatever's happening

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
here you got a hot spot inside your

128
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,320
intestinal tract and maybe it never went

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,320
that far and you've never been diagnosed

130
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,000
and you're just kind of like you're

131
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,520
dealing with certain aches and pains or

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,360
certain stomach cramps or flatulence or

133
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,039
stomach issues or bloating whatever it

134
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,960

this gets messed with it's so easy to go

185
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,080
down a rabbit hole with eating and food

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,479
and eating and food when you don't even

187
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,520
know why you're even having a symptom or

188
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:44,800
a condition or a problem and we easily

189
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,800
associate a food we have instantly to a

190
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,800
problem right so if I had some kind of

191
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,520
inflammation because I had some strep in

192
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,759
my intestinal tract or strep in my colon

193
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,440
and I had some ecoli in my colon and

194
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,800
it's creating all kinds of different

195
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,000
pivots and divots inside my colon and

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
intestinal track just say I had that

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,720
right and then I'm eating something or

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,960
whatever it is and then I'm not feeling

199
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
good because that's starting to ache

200
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
down here or however it is I'm going to

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
be so messed up in my head I'm going to

202
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,000
be like I I don't know if it was that

203
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,080
maybe I should just have some toast some

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,639
dry toast or something and scrape off

205
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,199
the burnt stuff off the toast and just

206
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,159
have that plain I'm nauseous I got some

207
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,639
pain it confuses people everything does

208
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,399
no matter what it is that they have you

209
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,120
know going on and there's people who are

210
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,479
suffering from bloating constantly and

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,479
they want to get rid of that bloating so

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,919
they get told to drink celery juice

213
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
because they hear about it working and

214
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,560
saving lives and they go and they have

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,839
some and they're bloating still there

216
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,680
and they're like oh it's the celery

217
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,519
juice the celery juice is causing the

218
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,080
problem now it's every day it's a new

219
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,720
thing causing a problem and we get the

220
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,080
food fear so the food fear just goes

221
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,560
crazy in our minds and rightfully so

222
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,279
because it's that confusing and that

223
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,680
difficult to navigate and so people

224
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,079
don't realize the minute you start

225
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,480
getting sick the minute you start

226
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,959
getting symptoms unless you've

227
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,880
experienced this do you know what I'm

231
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,360

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,640
just want to be normal again you can go

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,800
down this rabbit hole and down and down

234
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,480
it and down it and down and it can get

235
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,959
really difficult for a lot of people you

236
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,920

309
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,240
into this these hot spots can create a

310
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,680
lot of problems putting a lot of

311
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,800
different pressure and stress on

312
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,480
someone's mind and Consciousness because

313
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,199
you don't know where to go how to fix it

314
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,519
what's wrong and so many people are

315
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:34,720
struggling on this level problem is it

316
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,320
can get into a situation of

317
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,800
PTSD so every time you put food in your

318
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,920
mouth this can develop into an eating

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,600
disorder where you're actually getting a

320
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,720
PTSD eating disorder where every time

321
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,880
food is entering into your mouth you're

322
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,839
scared you're afraid now you're worried

323
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,040
you're worried like is it going to be

324
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,320
okay is it going to hurt I don't feel so

325
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
good that food doesn't work for me and

326
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,240
then you'll instantly cast out foods

327
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,920
that actually are there to help you heal

328
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,240
and recover

329
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,519
you but yet you might accidentally keep

330
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,959
foods that are not helping you and you

331
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,959
keep them in because they feel good in

332
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,560
the moment it seems so that's where the

333
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,560
confusion lies as well we sit there we

334
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,720
don't know what to eat exactly and we'll

335
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,160
eat a food that seems to settle okay

336
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,320
feel okay but little do we know that

337
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,560
food's feeding a problem a condition

338
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,279
it's feeding some kind of virus or

339
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,800
pathogen it's adding to a problem it's

340
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,800
putting pressure on your pancreas more

341
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,800
issues to your liver more sluggishness

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,120
days later you're eating a food that

346
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,800
seems to be comfortable and seems to be

347
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,040

hot spot and now they're nauseous

377
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,000
they're nauseous they're sick they're

378
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,040

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
eat a carrot I was told carrots are

380
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,000
healthy and now they're all of a sudden

381
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,360
scared they're in fear now they're

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,560
eating butter on toast with an egg or

383
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,240
they're eating cheese and they're like

384
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,360
that's that's the only thing I can eat

385
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,720
is a piece of cheese or an egg or a

386
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,480
piece of toast and they end up in that

387
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,519
situation where they're pretty much on

388
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,959
toast egg and cheese diet I don't know

389
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,279
if you guys have ever seen that it's

390
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,360
like milk toast eggs and cheese that's

391
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,279
what they end up in or rice pudding

392
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,759

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,399
messed up because I was so afraid to eat

400
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,399
and this is a really critical critical

401
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,680
topic because it's happening every day

402
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,440
to people new people every day people

403
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,680
who have already been sick too every

404
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,800
single day Lisa says this is me over

405
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,360
there on IG I'm so sorry you guys

406
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,199
struggled with this along the way I'm

407
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
hitting the intestinal track talk first

408
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,360
with this issue but we're going to go

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
deeper into other places of how it works

410
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,759
with your brain how it works with

411
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,480
emotions how it works with creating the

412
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,000
eating disorder the food fear because

413
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,319
that's what we're talking about here is

414
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,240
food fear and it's food fear developed

415
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,600
from not feeling good and getting a

416
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,639
symptom not knowing what to eat still

417
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,800
struggling with that symptom associating

418
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,759
that food with that symptom and then

419
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,639
we're now down a rabbit hole that's what

420
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,120
we're talking about today so let's go

421
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,279
into it first I want to take a little

422
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,600
sip here I want to finish some of my

423
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,199
aren't you here if that's okay with you

424
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,399
guys tra said this oh wait um TR said

425
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,360
this is exactly my mother explanation

426
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,160
points this is wild you're touching on

427
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,920
exactly everything she's going through

428
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,440
it's like you heard our prayers when

429
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,760
listen and I want to talk about to you

430
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,720
something very important okay that that

431
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,240
you can heal and you can get better and

432
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
you can recover and get past this

433
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,799
there's a way also to understanding how

434
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
this works with Foods where you're

435
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,039
feeling this way and you're afraid and

436
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,160
you're having that food fear but there's

437
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,959
a way to come out of it and just having

438
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,679
this knowledge alone is going to help

439
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,919
people out there because once you

440
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
understand this a little bit you

441
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,120
understand your body then you understand

442
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,559
what's going on you could rise above the

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,039
food fear and the eating disorders that

444
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,120
are created and the PTSD that's created

445
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,240
from it it's all important Catalina over

446
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,240
there in IG this is exactly how I felt

447
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,280
for three years whoa three years whoa

448
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,720
where I'm scared to eat because

449
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,400
everything makes me bloated and then

450
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
it's scary and here's what happens on

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,640
that one since we are in the intestinal

452
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,760
tract talk let's go into bloating a

453
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,520
little bit bloating can come and go at

454
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,159
random times could be intermittent or

455
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,120

through H

493
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,360
yeah all right back to

494
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
this let's go into the bloating thing a

495
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,640
little bit the bloating thing is a

496
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,960
tricky one because you can be bloated

497
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,080
from something you ate 2 days ago and

498
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,799
then it still has you bloated and then

499
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,600
you eat something that can get rid of

500
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,039
your bloat so you drink or eat something

501
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,159
that can get rid of your bloat and but

502
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:15,240
you're now bloated you're bloated from

503
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:18,240
something else before days ago even a

504
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,600
week ago and now you're trying to eat

505
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,520
something or take something or drink

506
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,960
something that can fix your bloating if

507
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,320
you knew to do it long term if you knew

508
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,799
to do it long enough

509
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,039
it could fix it but you'll never know

510
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,159
because you'll never know you're still

511
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,960
bloated you don't know to do something

512
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,640
longterm enough you won't know what to

513
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,200
avoid a lot of people won't know what to

514
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,799
avoid and then we run into a

515
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,280
problem Michelle haters attacking the

516
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,480
way we eat is just sad yep haters are

517
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,159

what I see in a lot of people and plus

541
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,559
with the bloating and it wasn't going to

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,720
be a bloating talk but it's good to talk

543
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,240
about it a little bit what

544
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,960
happens is

545
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,279
that the HCL is so diminished your

546
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,600
gastric glands are so diminished

547
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,880
you have a lot of things growing in here

548
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,240
that shouldn't be growing in

549
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,240
here your liver stagnant and

550
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,279
sluggish and you're

551
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,520
bloating okay it has to be rectified it

552
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,760
has to heal it you have to recover you

553
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,120
have to get the bloating down like

554
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,200
celery juice is critical for recovering

555
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,320
bloat because it's restoring your HCL

556
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,039
it's restoring your gastric glands it's

557
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,600
killing off pathogens

558
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,960
yeast mold overgrowth of unproductive

559
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,679
fungus that's important all on its own

560
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,679
it's a medical medium tool you guys know

561
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,000
that tool and there's a lot of other

562
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,640
medical medium tools to get rid of

563
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,320
bloating but the point is is that in

564
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,799
order though to get rid of

565
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,159
bloating one has to understand that they

566
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,880
may be eating foods that aren't creating

567
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,880
their bloating but they're going to help

568
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,039
you get to the finish line but what

569
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,480
happens with bloating is you may eat a

570
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:06,279
healthy food that's going to help you

571
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,919
get to the finish line but instead you

572
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,440
get bloated because you're so hypers

573
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,559
sensitive that you're going to bloat so

574
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,200
easy you become afraid of that food you

575
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,640
become afraid of 4 oz of celery juice

576
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,880
you become afraid of

577
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,159
papaya afraid of a steamed

578
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,360
potato you become afraid of a wild

579
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,600
blueberry you become afraid of something

580
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,559
and then you're in this place where

581
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,840
you're afraid now of spinach you're

582
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:38,880
afraid of a leafy graen and when you get

583
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,640
to that point of fear and you don't know

584
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,880
what to eat we end up going to comfort

585
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,679
Foods foods that we've been eating since

586
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,520
we were a child foods that we've been

587
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,000
eating since we were young and we end up

588
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,039
running to like eggs cheese and toast

589
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,279
again we end up running back to Pasta

590
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,440
macaroni and cheese eggs toast we end up

591
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,400
running back to bread we end up running

592
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,440
running back to these kinds of foods or

593
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,840
we end up running back to treats and

594
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,760
chocolate and things like that because

595
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,279
we don't know where to go we get

596
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,919
stressed we're totally frustrated with

597
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,760
our healing process and what's wrong and

598
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,960
we just we go running for things that

599
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,640
aren't going to help us and it happens

600
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,960
every day out there mono eating is a

601
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,520
miracle okay a miracle for people so I'm

602
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,840
going to grab the cleanse the heel book

603
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,559
right here all right so Medical medium

604
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,880
put mono eating um on the map all these

605
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:39,440
years and it's important to understand

606
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:42,600
how it works right when you do like

607
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,039
aano eating where it's like bananas and

608
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,840
celery juice or steam potatoes and

609
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,120
celery juice and if you look you'll see

610
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,200
the different varieties in here what

611
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,960
happens is that you end up building up

612
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,720
your

613
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,120
HCL you end up healing the environment

614
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,360
in your intestinal tract you end up

615
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,320
reducing pathogen loads and you end up

616
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,679
recovering so so many people go to the

617
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,640
mono eating and cleanse the heel because

618
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,480
it literally saves their life it saves

619
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,159
them from surgeries I can't tell you how

620
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,600
many people that have reached out out

621
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,600
there in the world in medical Med

622
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,520
community that were able to avoid a

623
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,720
surgery where their doctor their surgeon

624
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,480
said you don't have to get 20 in of your

625
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,799
colon cut out you don't have to get 20

626
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,760
in of your intestinal tract cut out

627
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:36,720
and they actually literally save their

628
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,559
themselves from radical surgical

629
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,600
procedures because you're doing the mono

630
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,799
cleanse okay in cleanse to heal it's

631
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,000
that powerful and then once you heal a

632
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,279
lot of the hot spots in here too so once

633
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,520
you heal a lot of the hot spots you can

634
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,840

food

649
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,960
sensitivities the monoc cleanse corrects

650
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,919
them starts to restore the person moves

651
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
them P back out of this and I'm talking

652
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,520
about the monoc cleans cuz so many

653
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,559
people have food fear and if they have a

654
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,120
symptom or condition anything intestinal

655
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,919
tract anything stomach anything like

656
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,679
that that they're suffering and

657
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:50,840
struggling with it's now a game of PTSD

658
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,600
what do I eat food

659
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,480
fear and we end up with this eating

660
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
disorder around all of it and we're

661
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,399
suffering and we're struggling and we

662
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,200
don't know how to get out of it but when

663
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,600
you have direction and you know what to

664
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,840
do and you end up doing something like

665
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
the medical medium monoc cleanse and you

666
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,720
choose one that's right for you just

667
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,000
choose the one that you feel will work

668
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,600
because that's the whole thing you can

669
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,120
choose different ones in here you could

670
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,120
try one try another and then what

671
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,399
happens is as you're recovering at least

672
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:22,200
you have a a schematic at least you have

673
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,480
a catalyst to actually adhere by to take

674
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,279
you to that finish line where you don't

675
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,559
have to be always questioning things

676
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,640
like is this not good is this not good

677
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,320
because you don't have to question

678
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,480
something that's literally saved that

679
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,200
many lives and healed that many people

680
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,200

digesting the tomato is

710
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,080
digesting the lettuce is

711
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,640
digesting they don't think it's diges

712
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,320
gesting but it is but what they're

713
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,200
feeling is inflamed nerves attached to

00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,159
track they're feeling hot

719
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,640
spots is what they're feeling so as the

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,440
lettuce is moving through and the

721
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,519

again what they don't

731
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,799
realize is it's okay to eat the lettuce

732
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,760
it's it's okay to eat the Cucumber it's

733
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,279
okay to eat the tomato but then they're

734
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,760
in fear that it's not okay because

735
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,960
they're feeling something but what they

736
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,039
don't realize is they're feeling a hot

737
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,200
spot they're feeling a Hot Spot

738
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,200
somewhere whether it's a hot spot where

739
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,519
it's just

740
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,360
bloat or it's a hot spot where they're

741
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:26,760
feeling a cramp or some pressure or a

742
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,399
little bit of pain or discomfort or

743
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,000
something else and they're feeling like

744
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,640
they're not digesting that raw lettuce

745
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,159
they feel like they're not digesting

746
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,760
those tomatoes and

747
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,840
cucumbers and that orange they eat or

748
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,399
whatever it is and they're just like I

749
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,440
cannot eat citrus I cannot ever have

750
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,640

751
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,960

those are ruled out and gone so we have

760
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,880
this problem

761
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,799
where they can't eat anything raw

762
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,440
completely ruled out so now they're in

763
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,840
that zone nothing raw so what that means

764
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,919
is they won't even have any raw juice

765
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,960
they won't have raw celery they won't

766
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
have raw celery juice which is different

767
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,360
different and it works differently you

diet now so now you're like I can only

790
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,080
do cook food or

791
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,080
toast or eggs and I hear eggs are so

792
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,519
healthy and blah blah blah and

793
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,639
everybody's talking about eggs so let me

794
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,159
go on a whole bunch of eggs four or six

795
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:45,559
eggs a day because it's the only thing I

796
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,519
can eat because it doesn't seem to hurt

797
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,440
when I eat an egg so what they don't

798
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,600
realize is they end up losing all these

799
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,639
foods that can help them

800
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,159
heal but then because they don't

801
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:59,639
understand and how know how to read

802
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,559
their hot

803
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:02,919
spots and they think they're not

804
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,320
digesting it

805
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,880
whatsoever and they have food fear to

806
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,720
towards all these foods and then they

807
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,840
eat an egg and they don't feel anything

808
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:19,840
no hot spot no problem no discomfort

809
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,000
they eat a nice fluffy scrambled egg

810
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,080
they need a n they eat a nice batch of

811
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,600
fluffy egg

812
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,159
whites and it goes down in here they get

813
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,880
a hard-boiled egg and it goes down and

814
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,840
it sits in here and what's happening

815
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,960
what they don't realize is the egg is

816
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,760
liquefying it's turning into a goo and

817
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,440
that goo isn't massaging the intestinal

818
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,720
tract it's not massaging the colon It's

819
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,519
not massaging the stomach and what's

820
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,399
happening is that egg is just turning

821
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,880
into a little like a ball of glue forget

822
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:58,159
eggs that bread is turning into a ball

823
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,120
of glue forget bread that cheese is

824
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,559
turning into a ball of glue and it's

825
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,880
sitting in there and it feels okay it

826
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,760
feels

827
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,119
good hey that bread pasta

828
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,440
basically that wheat

829
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:16,599
pasta with the cheese sitting in there

830
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,079
like goo and it's not touching anything

831
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,000
so it's not touching any of the hot

832
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,399
spots you're not getting red flags no

833
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,440
red flag here no red flag there no red

834
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,159
flag there but what's happening is the

835
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,520
eggs the dairy products the cheese the

836
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,200
milk the butter all of that that's

837
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,480
sitting in here is

838
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,480
feeding what's keeping you

839
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,720
sick it's feeding what's keeping you

840
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,839
sick and then you end up with the same

841
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,960
symptoms no matter what that come and go

842
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,960
so now it's not like every symptoms gone

843
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,000
cuz you're eating milk eggs cheese and

844
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,800
butter and bread and it's becoming a goo

845
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,359
and it's not touching anything inside

846
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,079
and it's becoming a goo it's not hitting

847
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,920
any hot spots for the moment but you

848
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,240
stay sick you end up getting sicker and

849
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,320
then all of a sudden because everything

850
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,920
you're eating is feeding the bad bugs

851
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,079
the bacteria the unproductive yeast the

852
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,839
unproductive fungus and mold the viruses

853
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,160
because what you're eating is feeding

854
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,400
all of that you all of a sudden get a

855
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,079
spill you get a

856
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,480
spill a spill

857
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:36,040
over what that means is it just all

858
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,119
blows up the bacteria proliferated the

859
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,440
virus has got a little too too fat and

860
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,280
happy and it spilled over and it blew up

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,000
and now you're

862
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,119

their life and they're eating just as

anybody else would be eating and then

957
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,440
these symptoms start to develop you're

958
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,119

questionable this is so so powerful Andy

962
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,800
melany over there on

YouTube thank you for timestamping so

when you do the the comment and you

966
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,640
timestamp it like you do that's actually

967
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,760
really cool by the

968
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,480
way in some cases if it's a chronic

969
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,000
nausea for example then Foods become

970
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,319
pick and choose a game of what's going

971
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,800
to help ease this nausea then nausea

972
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:36,760
hell the nausea hell have you been

973
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:41,000
through it before it torments pregnant

974
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,920
women who don't know what to eat they

975
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,359
have a baby

976
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,720
developing the baby developing needs

977
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,720
nutrients the best

978
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,280
nutrients the

979
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,280
nausea is like

980
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,920
this

981
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,079
barrier to getting nutrient to the baby

982
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,040
because when women become pregnant and

983
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,960
they're nauseous all the time they end

984
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,440
up choosing foods that are trying to

985
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,160
work with the nausea versus choosing a

986
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,920
food that's going to be really good for

987
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,200
that early stage of development for the

988
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,119
baby instead they're choosing things

989
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,880
like anything to break the nausea

990
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,000
they're choosing chocolate loaded with

991
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,560
caffeine that's really bad

992
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,599
for the tiny cells that are developing

993
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,200
into a a

994
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,040
fetus and so what's happening so they're

995
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,480
choosing things that are they're trying

996
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,720
to calm the nausea down the morning

997
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,119
sickness so they're just eating gluten

998
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:43,280
Rich toast with butter they're drinking

999
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,680
coffee yes they're eating chocolate

1000
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,880
they're just eating pasta and cheese

1001
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,880
they're eating chocolate cake they're

1002
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,480
just working with the nausea no judgment

1003
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,359
nothing like that I'm giving you an

1004
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,000
example of how those early cells of the

1005
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,800
baby need celery

1006
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,160
juice they need sweet

1007
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:10,119
potatoes they need winter squash caboa

1008
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,359
squash they need beautiful red

1009
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,200
potatoes they need

1010
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,960
blueberries they need raspberries they

1011
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,559
need all of these things these early

1012
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,559
cells of the baby that are just

1013
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,040
developing need all of these foods but

1014
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,680
instead because of the nausea those

1015
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,920
Foods aren't on the list for a lot of

1016
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,800
women that get that early nausea with

1017
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,800
their early pregnancy and they're just

1018
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,720
looking for just glue they're looking

1019
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,240
for just glue they just kind of calm the

1020
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,240
nausea

1021
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,559
down okay in some cases if someone has

1022
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,599
chronic nausea and chronic nausea just

1023
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:51,319
minus the pregnancy like nausea in

1024
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,520

1026
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,440

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,440
for so many people I'm so sorry you've

1071
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,440

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,280
that do any of the foods I'm eating are

1073
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,640
they the reason for my nausea are they

1074
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,480
creating the nausea then our mind and

1075
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,280
our Consciousness starts to pick up on

1076
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,800
patterns and habits because of small

1077
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,800
bursts of PTSD developing did you hear

1078
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,880
that you guys you guys got to have this

1079
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,880
book tell other people about this book

1080
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,240
such a great

1081
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,000
book you eat something and you're

1082
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,839
nauseous so you identify

1083
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,400
that food as being the problem so you

1084
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,520
learn to avoid that food just as you get

1085
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,800
comfortable eating another food thinking

1086
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,240
you're safe and good you get nauseous

1087
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,599
again you just got comfortable with that

1088
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,880
food you're starting to eat an orange

1089
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,440

Orange Boom see you later orange Gone

1094
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,160
With the Wind

1095
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,640
man

1096
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,359
you just started getting comfortable

1097
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,480
with each food and then you're

1098
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,599
uncomfortable with that food so Kiss It

1099
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,680
Goodbye you think you're safe and you

1100
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,839
think you're good and then boom you're

1101
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,960
not safe anymore safeness is gone so

1102
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,920
then that's another food you're

1103
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,480
uncomfortable eating suspecting it's

1104
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,440
contributing to the problem is that my

1105
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,800
problem is it my problem this can carry

1106
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,119
on into other Foods as well nausea

1107
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,280
doesn't usually receive a diagnosis

1108
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,319
because nausea or maybe be nervous could

1109
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,839
maybe be nervousness and

1110
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,280
anxiety if everything checks out okay in

1111
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:37,240
the abdomen it's passed off as your just

1112
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,319
sensitive so nausea really is the

1113
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,079
diagnosis it doesn't really get a

1114
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:43,760
diagnosis especially if everything

1115
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,920
checks out okay if you're somebody with

1116
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,160
a mystery

1117
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,599
nausea and everything looks okay and

1118
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,119
checks out

1119
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,520
okay you're sensitive that's what is

1120
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,040
told to each person what's not told to

1121
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,040
the person is they might have a pathogen

1122
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,559

1123
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,160

1124
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,480

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,400
person then there's really eyeballs on

1272
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:52,319
what you're doing and if you got a lot

1273
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,880
of aunts and uncles and cousins and

1274
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,920
family members and they all start

1275
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,000
thinking you're the one with the

1276
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,400
tightness of of the chest you're the one

1277
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,400
with the anxiety you're the one that

1278
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,880
doesn't want to eat this doesn't want to

1279
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,880
eat that not sure what to eat here it's

1280
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,280
always about a food problem and you're

1281
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,000
one of those

1282
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,400
people now you're going to be like up

1283
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,599
you know up shit's creek without a

1284
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,319
paddle

1285
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:22,359
right your original symptoms don't even

1286
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,839
matter anymore it's like no I started

1287
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,280
out with a pain in my chest the

1288
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,119
tightness of my chest I started out and

1289
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,720
they said it was panic attack but then I

1290
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,200
got tingles and numbness in my arms and

1291
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,799
then I got this and then I got this now

1292
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,839
I got fatigue that doesn't matter

1293
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:34,280
anymore it's all about what you're

1294
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:37,680
eating

1295
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:40,599
now affirmation 65 over there in IG that

1296
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:45,000
was my life

1297
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:48,799
OMG you got an audience now you sought

1298
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,160
out doctors to get help but that's long

1299
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,839
been forgotten by the

1300
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,880
audience especially if you're like 21 or

1301
00:54:53,839 --> 00:55:01,760
25 years old or 28 years old or

1302
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,680
18 years old or younger or however maybe

1303
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,160
in your 30s but either way you have an

1304
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,520
audience now and now you got like

1305
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,640
friends friends

1306
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,040
friends family family friends family

1307
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,040
friends co-workers families friends and

1308
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,079
they're all watching you and it isn't

1309
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,720
about your symptoms anymore it's just

1310
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,240
about you and your food and how you

1311
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,720
screwed up it's you and your food and

1312
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,319
how you have must have an eating

1313
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,000
disorder now and maybe your simp

1314
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,119
symptoms weren't really real to begin

1315
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,559
with maybe your digestive problems

1316
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,400
weren't really real maybe you're not

1317
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,039
really sick you were sick you got

1318
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,880
doctors saying you were sick I guess but

1319
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,160
all that's kind of drifting away because

1320
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,319
it's all about what you're putting in

1321
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,839
your mouth in your foods and your

1322
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:45,799
problems in your foods and that's

1323
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:49,839
compiling and compounding the PTSD

1324
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:51,200
causing now even more riffs more PTSD

1325
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,000
and now you feel like you're really down

1326
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,240
the rabbit hole and no one understands

1327
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,640
you and you're

1328
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,000
misunderstood Shan J over there on

1329
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,520
YouTube thank you for being here by the

1330
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,319
way you're speaking to me right now you

1331
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,319
said you commented amazing Cherry appan

1332
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:10,880
can relate to everything you're

1333
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,240
describing over there in IG family and

1334
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,119
friends could never understand it wasn't

1335
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,720
until I had to have emergency surgery

1336
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:23,039
that they believed

1337
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:26,599
me the focus is all gone now it's the

1338
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:30,280
focus on you're not eating enough are

1339
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:33,680
you eating enough you're eating too much

1340
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,720
you're getting too skinny you're looking

1341
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:41,079
sickly you need to put some meat on your

1342
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:44,200
bones are you getting enough

1343
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:47,839
protein and you're not eating the right

1344
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,799
things then the fear of eating occurs

1345
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,200
and

1346
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,319
intensifies and that's harder than

1347
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,319
anyone can understand and it happens

1348
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:56,839
every day out there there are people

1349
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,559
just you know

1350
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,599
there are people that Heckle the medical

1351
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,440
medum community and they're just trying

1352
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,960
to put fear and doubt in their minds are

1353
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,520
you getting enough protein are you

1354
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,319
getting enough protein there's so

1355
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,359
there's it's everywhere it's everywhere

1356
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:13,359
and when you're sick and struggling and

1357
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,440
you don't feel good it's like the

1358
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:20,559
vultures come in is what they do the

1359
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,680
vultures come in and they just say the

1360
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,440
rot in this crap and they don't

1361
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,559
understand what you've been through they

1362
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,359
don't know what your struggles are

1363
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:33,920
they're not in your shoes and at your

1364
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,920
home they don't get

1365
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,440
it even if you

1366
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,760
diagnos even if you're diagnosed with a

1367
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,240
named physical condition right off the

1368
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,240
bat it's easy to develop an eating

1369
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,000
disorder in part because there's still

1370
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,559
not a medical understanding of what

1371
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,640
causes the

1372
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,920
condition so it's not getting healed

1373
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,000
somebody with a simple case of heartburn

1374
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,720
acid reflux or exam for example can

1375
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,920
develop an eating disorder because it's

1376
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,640
always on their mind let's hit that a

1377
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,000
little

1378
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:10,160
bit W blueberry's over

1379
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,760
there the protein brainwashing has drove

1380
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,920
me crazy and we will have to deal with

1381
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:20,839
it for the rest of

1382
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:22,400
Life yeah this just that's powerful by

1383
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,680
the

1384
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,359
way okay so I want to go into this part

1385
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,119
this is interesting right here right

1386
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,960
even if it's something like a simple

1387
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,520
case of heartburn acid reflux you guys

1388
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,280
for example it can develop into an

1389
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,880
eating disorder because it's always on

1390
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,280
your mind because it's here it's like

1391
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,760
heartburn what do I eat oh that bothers

1392
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,720
me oh that doesn't bother me that

1393
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,000
doesn't bother me that bothers

1394
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,599
me a friend I haven't talked to in a

1395
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,640
long long time reached out to me and

1396
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,520
said you know I got this heartburn acid

1397
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,599
reflux thing I did all the testing at

1398
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,359
the doctor I did all this everything

1399
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:02,559
and um it's like I'm scared to eat

1400
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,680
anything ew scared to eat anything

1401
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,119
anything I eat I don't know this was

1402
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,559
working for me yesterday it's not

1403
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,640
working for me today this might work for

1404
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:16,760
me tomorrow but it didn't when tomorrow

1405
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,760
came yesterday and your mind goes wof

1406
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,480
W eating a food that seems to be working

1407
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,319
gives you a sense of security then if it

1408
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,480
isn't working anymore and the acid

1409
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:29,559
reflux or nausea returns it's like old

1410
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,559
friend letting you down old friend

1411
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:34,520
letting you down sometimes it's not

1412
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:36,200
about the symptoms sometimes experiences

1413
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,039
when you're eating that food it's about

1414
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:42,480
what they're told about that food so

1415
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:45,359
here's a real brain screw

1416
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,520
is even if you discover somewhere along

1417
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,920
the way the right food to eat to heal

1418
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,400
yourself some [ __ ] is going to like

1419
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,880
tell you that it's the wrong food and

1420
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,559
it's bad for

1421
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,839
you I don't know how anybody can heal

1422
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,520
anymore out there I just don't know it's

1423
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:05,559
that bad there's that many sick people

1424
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,200
and they're just biohacking themselves

1425
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:11,839
to death and everybody's like squealing

1426
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,880
like pics like do this do that buy my

1427
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:17,760
program do this eat this do

1428
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,839
that and darkness is rampant out there

1429
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,640
right now I don't know how people are

1430
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,000
going to survive in 10 years from now as

1431
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,359
it gets worse and worse and

1432
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,960
worse yeah they'll poach things for

1433
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:30,520
medical medium information that's healed

1434
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,799
people along the way but they'll mix it

1435
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,280
with crap that won't heal them I don't

1436
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:36,920
know how anybody's going to get better

1437
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,400
down down the road Natalie says the

1438
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,359
sickest and most narcissistic people

1439
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,559
prey on those trying to better

1440
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:47,440
themselves we live in a sick world it's

1441
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:51,400
overwhelming sometimes well

1442
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:54,400
spoken I could not have said that better

1443
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:57,039
myself Dr Fawn biohackers are hacking

1444
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,079
People's Health away indeed they're

1445
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:03,559
pecking People's Health

1446
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,799
away food has an ingrain connection to

1447
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:07,839
our physical being our physical

1448
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,839
understanding even if we aren't dealing

1449
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:12,319
with ongoing Health complaints if

1450
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:14,599
someone is home one evening gets some

1451
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,480
kind of chest pain for a minute and gets

1452
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:18,640
on the phone with family and friends the

1453
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,920
first thing everyone says is what did

1454
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,359
you eat

1455
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,520
tonight if that person decides to go to

1456
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:28,280
the ER the doctor asks what did you eat

1457
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,599
tonight night the question always comes

1458
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,599
up that's how interconnected we are with

1459
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,799
food in general and that's how we end up

1460
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:37,920
living with food fear like we are so

1461
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:40,000
interconnected it's one of those details

1462
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,960
that Patients First Volunteer every time

1463
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,720
they go into the ER to the hospital I

1464
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,200
ate this and this tonight I ate this

1465
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,359
tonight I ate this ter appan says when

1466
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,920
people try to frame medical medium yeah

1467
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:54,720
frame that is the word yes as

1468
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,160
restrictive and fear-mongering the only

1469
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,119
reason I can eat without excruciating

1470
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,160
pain and fear is because of medical

1471
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,359
medium information I was literally

1472
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,440
starving to death I couldn't eat thank

1473
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,440
you Tara you're the

1474
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,319
best I was sitting at home eating my

1475
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:15,119
dinner I had this terrible pain in my

1476
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,000
stomach my back my chest my lower

1477
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,240
abdomen I thought I don't know what I

1478
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,480
thought it come to the ER and that's the

1479
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:24,079
first thing people devou because the

1480
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,520
reason why they devou that information

1481
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,079
is because it's so intertwined to foods

1482
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:33,440
and eating and our health and foods and

1483
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:35,319
eating you guys I could go on all day

1484
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,680
long with this

1485
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:40,279
book that's how much incredible

1486
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,559
information is in this book Brain saver

1487
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:44,640
Casey shelman over there on YouTube I

1488
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,720
think sometimes it's jealousy and

1489
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:51,240
insecurity about how they eat

1490
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,279
sometimes projecting their fears on

1491
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:56,359
what's different but they see the

1492
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:58,760
healing but they project their fears cuz

1493
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:01,480
they don't want to have to think about

1494
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,760
healing and health and what to eat and

1495
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,160
meaning like they think of okay

1496
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,920
okay everybody thinks about what to eat

1497
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,960
I don't care who they are

1498
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:14,319
everyone and everyone is worried about

1499
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,039
their food to some degree no matter what

1500
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,799
because you can't just eat 10 loaves of

1501
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,319
bread with butter on it you'll end up

1502
01:03:17,799 --> 01:03:22,440
with pancreatitis with with a pound of

1503
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,119
butter you can't just eat a whole

1504
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,480
chocolate cake every single night

1505
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:28,279
because that's not going to help

1506
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,039
you can't do a lot of things you got to

1507
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:34,440
be careful with lupus free celery 333

1508
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:37,400
over there on YouTube I just read an

1509
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:40,200
anti-ed medium post from someone who was

1510
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,920
on medical medium for 7 years and gained

1511
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,240
30 lbs yet she is posting other

1512
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,799
supplements and chocolate and saying to

1513
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,520
be your own health expert and stop with

1514
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:52,119
the cult first of all you can't even

1515
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,039
tell you can't even trust if that's a

1516
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:56,480
real story meaning like the story

1517
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:57,720
they're trying to frame and paint

1518
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,720
there's been an attack on the medical

1519
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,160
medum community by a group of people you

1520
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,760
guys know about the plotters and so

1521
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,200
forth there's been a massive attack on

1522
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,359
the community um a lot of people injured

1523
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,119
in the community we know because a lot

1524
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:12,160
of people have told us about their harm

1525
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:13,880
stories how damaged they are and injured

1526
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,000
they are and we're actually working on

1527
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,319
that working with them and doing

1528
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,200
something about that by the way and and

1529
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:24,079
it's going to be some people in trouble

1530
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,000
point is is that a lot of damage has

1531
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:30,359
been done due to framing and lies and so

1532
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,039
forth and the attack and a lot of fake

cover's dirty or something you can clean

1590
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,359
the cover off you know I use like a

1591
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:14,880
handy wipe and it just cleans the cover

1592
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:17,279
right off and the conveyor belt at

1593
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,079

1594
01:07:17,279 --> 01:07:22,440
greasy and stuff so it gets on the books

1595
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:26,039
the books are white they're brand new

1596
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,640
books there are no used books

1597
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,160
you know like if you're ordering a new

1598
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,640

01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:34,200
ordering a used book and you'll see like

1600
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:37,000
the covers get dirty so I like to clean

1601
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,279
them anyway but when you get new books

1602
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,920
you order them from Amazon you get a new

1603
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:42,160
medical medium book and it comes like

1604
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,079

1609
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,680

that for a while on Telegram and I

1642
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,719
talked all about how healing it is why

1643
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,120
it's healing how demons were kept out of

1644
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:34,560
that you know cuz the industry you know

1645
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,239
how the movie industry and the TV

1646
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,520
industry is can be really dark right

1647
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,719
like really dark with a lot of

1648
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,279
possession all of that stuff did I

1649
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,600
talked about that before like people

1650
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:50,480
just bring their demons into that stuff

1651
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:57,320
right and um and how the film industry

1652
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:57,320
can be really dark really dark and

1653
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:04,320
the film industry can be really really

1654
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:06,480
dark and Pride and Prejudice okay the

1655
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,600
not not Pride and Prejudice in general

1656
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,800
just the

1657
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:14,320
filming of the 1994 1995 Pride and

1658
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,480
Prejudice I talked about on telegram how

1659
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,920
healing it is for the nervous system

1660
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,800
there's a reason why it's healing for

1661
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,080
the nervous system so if you need

1662
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,920
something to watch because you're

1663
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,880
sensitive you need something that

1664
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:27,320
actually has a frequency that can help

1665
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,440
heal the nervous

1666
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:32,199

01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:03,280
Prejudice I have owned the series

1678
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:04,360
19951 since it came out on DVD so you

1679
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,480
know what I'm talking about there's a

1680
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,719
frequency right well no one knew that

1681
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,080
that there's this what happened was

1682
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,760
because I know because Spirit of

1683
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:16,280
compassion told me

1684
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,520
that those demonic forces Darkness

1685
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,199
everything was just kept out of that

1686
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:23,360
film because in the film industry it's a

1687
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,880
lot of Darkness everything was kept out

1688
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,400
of it and

1689
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,520
it's very powerful and heals the nerves

1690
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,480
it's incredible really incredible

1691
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,000
