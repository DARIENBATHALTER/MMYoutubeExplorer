00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,720
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,560
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,400
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,880
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,200
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,160
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,160
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,359
William hey everybody we're talking

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,879
about modern-day vampirism now before

16
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,559
you jump into any conclusions we're not

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,559
talking about people with fangs in Black

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,480
capes leaving two bite marks on your

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,120
neck

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,640
that would be scary it's way worse than

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,960
that because it's real and it's

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,159
happening to you and it defies all

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,320
sensibility of the medical system what I

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
have to tell you is not an old folklore

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,360
story about

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,720
Transylvania instead it's about your

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,759
life your family your loved ones your

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,799
safety and life

29
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,200
preservation and if you have a chronic

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,840
illness it's make or break do or die

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,759
 or get off the pot we're talking

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,439
about blood draw your blood tests I'm

33
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,520
not against getting your blood tested

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,119
it's important it can be a window into

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,119
important information about your overall

36
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,920
health but blood testing is still

37
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,600
Antiquated it's running on Old stats and

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
averages of people that have long since

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,880
been gone during a time period in

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
history when so much was so much

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,799
different than what it is today normal

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,880
standards in today's blood profile comes

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,440
from long ago past and hasn't been

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,239
updated blood testing is not a

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,519
definitive accurate 100% clear method of

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,720
providing somebody with answers to why

47
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:23,400
they're chronically ill but it's still

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,200
important lifesaving and good doctors

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,080
are learning to read between the lines

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,440
when they're drawing blood and see

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
subtle differences that can be very

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,959
helpful through those blood tests with

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,480
that said we have a bigger problem the

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,800
medical system has gone unchecked no

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,319
one's questioned it and it's one of the

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,800
biggest scams of our modern day Health

57
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:52,640
System it's modernday blood leing the

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,319
draining of our blood on a level that's

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,800
unprecedented and unneeded every time

60
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,159
you get a blood test and you see those

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,080
pretty little tues tubes fill up with

62
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,480
red blood right before your eyes there's

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,720
a few things that are terribly wrong

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,200
first thing is they're going to throw

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,000
all that beautiful blood away in the

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,599
garbage almost all of it or preserve it

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,200
not for you but for who knows second of

68
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,480
all the blood you see in those tubes has

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,080
your hard-earned

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
systematically produced body's precious

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,439
go into the tubes see you later

alligator bye-bye Miss American Pie

77
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,439
drove my Chevy to the levy and the levy

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,720
went dry you lost your immune system it

79
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,840
went out the window not all your immune

80
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,599
system left your body and went out the

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,400
window but depending on how much blood

82
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,599
was drawn a large part of the most

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,519
important part of your immune system the

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,199
weight count that patrols your

85
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,720
bloodstream has left the house as you're

86
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,280
walking away from your doctor's

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,919
appointment less full and more

88
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,800
empty sometimes you're told to drink a

89
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,199
little apple juice have a cookie you'll

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,720
build your blood back quick they say if

91
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,479
they say anything at all that's reckless

92
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,680
a reckless statement and a ridiculous

93
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,680
one if we're all about science specifics

94
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,280
details truth facts then this is the

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,720
most blatant negligent careless process

96
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,639
we have to date what do you mean build

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,880
back your blood quickly the variables

98
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,360
range on all levels how much blood was

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,479
drawn how weak is your immune system to

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,840
begin with how chronically ill are you

101
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,240
what kind of symptoms do you live with

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,520
what kind of Demands stress and load is

103
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,120
on your plate or your life what's your

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,600
diet like are you a man or are you a

105
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,600
woman and when was the last time you had

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
a blood draw it's not as simple as

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,560
you'll be fine eat enough food and

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,800
you'll level out you're lucky if the

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,039
even give you a tip to eat the system

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,199
will never get its thirst quenched they

111
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,479
will bleed you to death steal your blood

112
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,000
shorten your life by weakening your

113
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:48,919
reserves and never ever ever be held

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,759
accountable for it you might hold them

115
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,520
accountable after you hear what you're

116
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,639
about to hear you wake up with your

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,960
first symptoms you start Doctor shopping

118
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,319
like so many do and they take your your

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,240
blood no one knows why you're really

120
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,759
sick it's mostly low-grade viral

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,560
infections and toxic heavy metals like

122
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
I've always said causing your future

123
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,919
diagnoses you're autoimmune at your

124
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,919
doctor's office when they take your

125
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:25,560
blood how much blood are they drawing is

126
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:29,840
it four vials five vials s 10 14 18 24

127
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:34,680
28 more let's say they take five vials

128
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,160
those are five full vials in that blood

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,560
is your immune system and your immune

130
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,680
system took time to build it's keeping

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,599
you from getting sicker it's patrolling

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,880
your body looking for Invaders looking

133
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:52,759
for pathogens and even toxins and doing

134
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,440
their job gobbling them up when they see

135
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,400
them those toxins and Invaders are

136
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,960
mostly why you're at the doctor's office

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,000
Hashimoto's

138
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:08,800
fibromyalgia ra multiple sclerosis lupus

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,479
eczema psoriasis acne rosacea Vitiligo

140
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,360
dizziness tingles and numbness like so

141
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,520
many have fatigue especially that

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,680
neurological fatigue people get where

143
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,919
they just can't even walk and they don't

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,039
even feel like they're living their life

145
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:28,199
brain fog depression anxiety loss of

146
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,879

Crohn's

151
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,360
bloating caused by all these Invaders

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,759
and toxins that are inside our blood so

153
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,039
as they draw blood they're taking away

154
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,159
your offense and defense at the same

155
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,879
time that would probably be somewhat

156
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:04,599
okay acceptable if they didn't almost

157
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:07,759
throw all of your blood away but they do

158
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,680
they take a few drops at best a thimble

159
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,560
and toss the rest out to toss it

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,840
somewhere you go home and it takes weeks

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,520
even months to get that CBC that

162
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,919
complete blood count back to normal

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,400
white blood cells red blood cells

164
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,840
platelets but most importantly that

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,719
white blood count decide

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,800
the condition you are going to be in

167
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,680
with your symptoms and conditions no

168
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,560
one's aware or monitoring if they should

169
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,519
be careful with how much blood they draw

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,560
from you at any given time you could be

171
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,279
someone with a compromised immune system

172
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,839
meaning your white blood cells are

173
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,080
weakened low in numbers or on the edge

174
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,480
so your doctor is supposed to be

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,160
cautious keep your vials two or three

176
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,160
max if sensitive and maybe for max if

177
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,920
you're stronger and really it should be

178
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,720
half vials going to talk more about that

179
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,640
later but your doctor they're not taught

180
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,440
by the industry your doctor's boss the

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,880
industry that your immune system gets

182
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,279
taken out of your body with your blood

183
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,680
goes unused and is destroyed thrown out

184
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:31,079
thrown away or Worse stored somewhere

185
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,680
you may someone that doesn't build their

186
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,959
immune system back quicker than others

187

bottom this is a deception from the top

297
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,079
it's not the FLOTUS it's not the nurses

298
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,079
it's bigger than everyone it's big

299
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,160
Pharma and the handful of people at the

300
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:24,199
top with a mission to drain your blood

301
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,000
you don't believe me you know then why

302
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:30,639
else are they doing it because they made

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,920
a simple mistake or something someone

304
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,399
didn't get a memo nothing was fixed no

305
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,600
one thought about it if it's not on

306
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,440
purpose then it shows you that stupidity

307
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,240
controls the top of the medical system

308
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
you should bite your tongue next time

309
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,440
you think science knows everything and

310
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,319
has your back then it's Reckless Twisted

311
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,399
horrifying and downright demonic harsh

312
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,839
words you have no idea how many people

313
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,639
have died from getting blood testing

314
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,800
while living with chronic illness died

315
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:07,880
early in their life so let's talk about

316
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,079
cancer whether you believe in the truth

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,079
that cancer is caused by viruses and

318
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,440
toxins or you just think cancer is

319
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,600
genetic you still need your immune

320
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,920
system to keep your cancer in check your

321
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,800
white count controls your cancer your

322
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,480
white count gobbles up and destroys

323
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,160
cancer cells and most importantly

324
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,959
gobbles up the viruses that create

325
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,959
cancer cells you get diagnosed with

326
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,519
cancer most likely you've already had

327
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,800
symptoms and conditions you've been sick

328
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,279
already and you've had enough blood

329
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,360
draws previously knocking your immune

330
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,959
system down prior to your cancer

331
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,360
diagnosis or your blood draws started

332
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,720
right with your cancer diagnosis either

333
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,040
way they step up your blood draws you go

334
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,199
into rapid routine blood testing this

335
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,199
puts a constant drain on your immune

336
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:03,880
system system the one thing keeping you

337
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,640
from worsening think the cancer doctor

338
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,400
will mention anything no take blood at

339
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,559
will take no hostages and ignore any

340
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,240
Common Sense sensibility any reason or

341
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,439
reasoning your white count lives inside

342
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,799
of you in your blood for the most part

343
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,280
it's tragic when it has to leave its

344
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,600
home un

345
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,600
necessarily the sicker you get as a

346
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,799
cancer patient the more blood they take

347
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,640
the sicker you get the more blood they

348
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,720
take they drain you dry it's

349
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,840
devastating look if you have the

350
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,720
opportunity in the truth you have to use

351
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,799
that to keep people safe healthy and

352
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,799
alive I can see it now a lot of unhappy

353
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:52,679
doctors Specialists blood Labs what an

354
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:55,360
inconvenience this next bomb is as it

355
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,159
leaves the medical medium Cannon and

356
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,400
causes a crater in the broken health

357
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,640
system when the people find out they've

358
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:10,919
been screwed over they know they've been

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,200
finished why is this much different than

370
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,240
today because it's not it's conventional

371
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,120
medicine's finest f up that of course

372
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,880
alternative medicine adopted as well CU

373
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,559
alternative medicine always adopts all

374
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,000
the conventional medicine fups they

375
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,640
don't know what's wrong with you with

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
chronic illness so they draw your blood

377
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,039
draw your blood keep drawing your blood

378
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,600

381
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,360
to get more blood drawn and then hey we

382
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,240
need your blood get back in here got to

383
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,760
draw some more blood and throw it all

384
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,200
away you get sicker they draw more blood

385
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:31,159
and throw it away they don't drain it in

386
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:35,200
a pan but still you get sicker a

387
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:38,200
specialist will draw 7 to 28 vials and

388
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,159
throw it away you got a better chance of

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,400
living through it than a 100 years ago

390
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,559
than 200 300 400 years ago because we

391
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,720
have resources to help stabilize us at

392
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,080
our fingertips right we got still some

393
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,000
good medical technology I won't say we

394
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,000
don't we really do and that's the

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,440
difference back then they just laid in a

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,760
bed blood Le with no water for days

397
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,880
terrible environmental conditions

398
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,880
shortages on food no proper blankets no

399
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,640
IVs to support their organs while their

400
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,320
blood was being removed no oxygen tanks

401
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,600
but it's still all the same the handful

402
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,640
of people at the top of the Medical

403
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,679
Science and the medical industry carried

404
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,640
blood leing all the way over to the

405
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,200
heads of the medical industry now it's

406
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,919
still the same but it's done differently

407
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,360
you might be someone thinking no way I

408
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,600

409
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,679
little acne my doctor checks my hormones

I'm doing good after my blood work this

411
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,520

412
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,760
gets your thyroid checked after 6 to8

413
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,240
weeks or every 6 to8 weeks or every 3

414
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,880
months you're doing okay maybe you're

415
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,440
someone diagnosed with sibo got a little

416
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,280
eczema your routine blood draws seem

417
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,640
normal maybe you're someone with with

418
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,799
Celiac everything seems to be up to par

419
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,200
your symptoms or conditions come and go

420
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,919
you get your blood work everything seems

421
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,080
okay or maybe you're someone your

422
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,360
symptoms are on an even kill you're

423
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,039
eating better taking supplements and all

424
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,559
this seems a little farfetched but

425
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,360
little do you know you're still getting

426
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,640
a hunk of your immune system removed and

427
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,360
you have a lot lot of years ahead of you

428
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,679
for things to go wrong because of it it

429
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,720
happens when you least expect it at the

430
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,520
worst moments in life too you're

431
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,240
coasting along everything's going okay

432
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,520
you're used to your symptoms here and

433
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,279
there but then comes that one blood draw

434
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,520
that pushes you too far and knocks you

435
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,720
on your ass you're dysfunctional

436
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,679
fatigued brain fogged can't think right

437
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,279
a little dizzy and now you think it's

438
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,000
something in your diet wait AE minut

439
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,200

440
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,600
it's got to be my diet maybe it's this

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,760
thing I took uh maybe it's something

442
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,240
else you're checking your supplements

443
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,799
but you have no clue it was your last

444
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,039
big blood draw even if it was weeks ago

445
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,720
or even months ago it was the blood draw

446
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,159
that pushed you over the edge it was the

447
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,640
straw that broke the camel's back before

448
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,240
that you had a strong Constitution you

449
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,679
weren't that sick you might be still

450
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,000
young you're you're in your 20s and it

451
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,200
sneaks up behind you and bites you on

452
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,440
the ankle like a snake and you're up 10

453
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,520
notches with your symptoms and you're

454
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,240
down 10 notches with your health and the

455
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,039
confusion of why you're getting worse

456
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,120
only gets worse and now it's the

457
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,240
guessing games time the real guessing

458
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,159
games not the mini guessing games the

459
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,960
major big guessing games more than ever

460
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,840

recent doctor or he or she Burns you out

it's off to another doctor and more

463
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,200
fresh blood work and suggestions such as

465
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,039
might help are you doing your charcoal

467
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,520
direction to go uh paleo how's that

you getting your fermented foods in are

473

you doing your probiotic iotics the

474
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,720
confusion goes on and it Carries On and

475
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,760
On you become fresh meat fresh meat

476
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,760
walking into that doctor specialist

477
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,120
office or the meat market you're a fresh

478
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,360
feeder happens to everybody with blood

479
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,720
draws over time there's a trend out

480
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,960
there not backed by any science just a

481
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,640
theory and the theory is becoming the

482
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,039
mantra for all alternative doctors and

483
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,480
practitioners it's your immune system is

484
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,799
all in your gut

485
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,559
heard that one yet that's a head

486
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,080
scratcher for me how can anybody trust

487
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:09,000
this since all practitioners and doctors

488
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,440
blood let everybody to begin with

489
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,600
they're wrong about the most important

490
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,000
aspects of medicine there is possible

491
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,840
the one they rely on the most for

492
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,760
answers your precious blood work and

493
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,960
blood supply but now they're right about

494
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,159
this your gut all your immune systems

495
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,640
working in your gut your entire immune

496
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,720
system is in your gut uh most of your

497
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,080
immune system is is in your gut do you

498
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,399
know where that came from it came from

499
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,120
probiotic and gut health companies

500
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:45,279
that's who came up with that theory uh

501
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,720
bias information anyone I hate to break

502
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,279
it to them but the majority of your

503
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,120
immune system is in your

504
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:56,039
bloodstream it's in your bloodstream to

505
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,799
protect your brain and your heart it's

506
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:01,720
in your bloodstream to try to stop

507
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,840
pathogens from going to your brain and

508
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,679
causing strokes and brain inflammation

509
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,200
it's in your blood stream to try to stop

510
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,880
pathogens from getting to your heart and

511
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,200
causing a blood clot or inflammation of

512
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,640
the ventricles it's in your bloodstream

513
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,440
to stop sepsis or blood poisoning or an

514
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,240
infection to your heart valve it's not

515
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,960
in your gut yes some of your immune

516
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,200
system is but the majority is in your

517
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,600
bloodstream your brain and heart are

518
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:41,000
Target number one for the enemy and both

519
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,799
are VIP to your immune system your heart

520
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,559
your brain are the VIPs to your immune

521
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,720
system but that's how misinformation

522
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,919
Trends are it's all in your gut immune

523
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,240
systems all in your gut just like they

524
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,000
said it's all in your head and then also

525
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,840
caffeine is good for you they say that

526
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,240
too it's good for pregnant women that's

527
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,200
what they say

528
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,120
now really or plunging in ice is good

529
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,159
for the body puts you in shock kills

530
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,440
your adrenals gives you mild hypothermia

531
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,919
but no it's good for your body uh how

532
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,760
about this when your brain lives on fat

533
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,799
oh really uh is that why they tell you

534
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,279
to eat sugar drink apple juice after you

535
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,360
donated

536
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:31,039
blood because someone at the top knows

537
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,120
if they don't give you sugar after they

538
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,279
theft at your blood you ain't walking

539
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,720
out of that blood donor's clinic or

540
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:41,720
doctor's office they don't say hey um

541
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,880
you just donated a pint your blood

542
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,120
here's a cup of coconut oil or here's a

543
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,159
cup of olive oil that's because your

544
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,679
brain is hungry it's hungry for sugar if

545
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,919
it goes without glucose for more than 5

546
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,120
minutes it starts to die but yet the

547
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,919
trend is to tell you your brain runs on

548
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,159
fat which contradicts what they tell you

549
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,960
after you've given blood who's right

550
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,320
who's wrong well next time you donate a

551
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,520
pint of blood or get a big blood draw

552
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,399
drink a cup of oil or eat a few

553
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,640
tablespoons of peanut butter and see if

554
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,360
you hit the sidewalk face down walking

555
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,279
out of there and if you're compromised

556
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,159
sensitive or sick with symptoms you'll

557
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,640
hit the sidewalk faster and harder but I

558
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,799
wouldn't do it because you need more

559
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,159
glucose for stabilization after having a

560
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,080
good amount of glucose removed from your

561
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:37,320
blood you remove the glucose you better

562
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,200
be putting some back in your sugar your

563
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:44,000
blood sugar as they're taking too much

564
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,480
blood from you they also took your

565
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,840
glucose not just your immune system when

566
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,600
you got your blood drawn the glucose

567
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,440
that keeps your brain alive which leads

568
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,240
to the next problem they not only drain

569
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,320
you of your immune system but they drain

570
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,799
you of your glucose reserves which for

571
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,559
the chronically ill means everything

572
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:10,399
neurological problems and symptoms that

573
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:13,240
The Chronic Leo have do worsen with the

574
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,480
loss of glucose and they take that away

575
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,760
from you too your blood sugar there's a

576
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,360
reason they measure blood sugar not

577
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,080
blood fat you can live without fat you

578
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,960
can't live without sugar the trendy

579
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,840
Health gurus think it's fat

580
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,120
that's real smart but hey they think all

581
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,360
your blood draws blood work blood tests

582
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:41,080
and how it's done is great normal F to

583
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,880
do until they hear this podcast and then

584
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,679
maybe start copycatting but they also

585
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,640
think your immune system's all in your

586
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,159
gut and many gurus think you're sick

587
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,600
because you haven't trained your neurop

588
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,960
Pathways to manifest your sickness to go

589
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,799
away because it's all in your head yeah

590
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,480
I love that one you know as if if your

591
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,080
mind is going to reverse the trauma the

592
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
physical trauma that's caused by

593
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,320
constantly getting your blood drawn yeah

594
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,440
okay okay every time they do a blood

595
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,760
draw your white count and red count go

596
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,360
out the door and whatever's making you

597
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:21,159
sick stays inside pathogens like viruses

598
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,799
such as Epstein bar the very bug behind

599
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,640
Hashimoto thyroiditis Lyme disease

600
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,039
multiple sclerosis lupus eczema Celiac

601
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,279
PCOS fibroids endometriosis stays in

602
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,559
your body because these Critters are not

603
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,840
in your bloodstream for the most part

604
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,679
that's why it's nearly impossible with

605
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,880
the blood testing they have now to find

606
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,000
active Epstein bar it's not a fullblown

607
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,760
infection in your bloodstream they're in

608
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,559
your organs glands and tissue where they

609
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,840
can survive your immune system and hide

610
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,600
and when your immune system is strong a

611
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,080
white blood blood cell sees an Epstein

612
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,440
bar virus Peaks its ugly head out of an

613
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,960
organ your killer cell Stomps on it and

614
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,200
destroys it but after a blood draw a lot

615
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,640
of your killer cells went bye-bye and

616
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,720
that Epstein bar Peaks its head out and

617
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,399
says I'm in the clear time to spread you

618
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,880
would think if your immune system's

619
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:27,000
being drawn out with your blood that

620
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,320
your pathogens would be drawn out and go

621
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,480
with it but they don't your blood cells

622
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,679
white count killer cells guard your

623
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,360
brain and heart making sure that Epstein

624
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,039
bar or any other pathogen doesn't get a

625
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,159
tollfree ride through your blood Highway

626
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,440
making a pit stop to another organ I

627
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,559
can't tell you how many times I

628
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,720
witnessed so many people get fullblown

629
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,279
mono after a blood draw because an

630
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,840
important portion of the immune system

631
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,799
that's inside their bloodstream has been

632
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,360
removed people get the flu after a blood

633
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:07,120
draw or any other bug going around

634
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,279
you're more susceptible or they get more

635
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,399
symptoms of what they're already

636
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,159
battling because pathogens travel when

637
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,960
they're not being controlled that's why

638
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,440
the immune system in your bloodstream is

639
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,240
so important but up until medical medium

640
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,639
information no one knew pathogens caused

641
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,799
any chronic illness just like they don't

642
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:31,639
know about the blood draw problem

643
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,919
Chinese medicine was unaware atic

644
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,240
medicine didn't know science and

645
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,639
research didn't know the vegans didn't

646
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,639
know the paleos didn't know Western

647
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:44,120
alternative medicine didn't know now

648
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:46,639
Doctors medical research and science are

649
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,360
using medical medium information that

650
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:53,240
Epstein bar is responsible or even

651
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,120
linked to a host of diseases after it

652
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,639
was already published but oh yeah

653
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,799
where's your science well science has

654
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,600
taken medical medium information

655
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,039
plagiarizing it and using it now leads

656
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,120
me to another critical point anyone

657
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,880
who's sick with any neurological symptom

658
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,880

needs needs electrolytes and a large

665
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,679
amount of your electrolytes are in your

666
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,799
blood as it leaves your body during a

667
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,480
blood draw we get in trouble and then

668
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,440
your brain your neurons and your

669
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,720
neurotransmitters get hit hard and lose

670
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,799
those critically needed Trace mineral

671
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,799
salts and electrolytes this isn't even

672
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,519
considered these blood draws the petus

673
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,360
of deep-seated electrolyte Reserves no

674
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,519
one's checking that no one's caring no

675
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,080
one's talking about it no one even knows

676
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,760
your neurological symptoms worsen but

677
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,519
that won't take the blame the last blood

678
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,360
draw you call your doctor you're feeling

679
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,840
worse weeks after your blood draw and he

680
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,200
or she's going to need another blood

681
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,519
draw and not even realize that you're in

682
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,279
a glucose electrolyte and immune system

683
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,880
deprivation from your last blood draw

684
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:32,399
you know what the say bad thing is blood

685
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,760
draws they Spike our adrenals too every

686
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,360
time the needle goes in your arm ow or

687
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,880
anywhere else in the body your adrenals

688
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,440
release fight or flight

689
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,240
epinephrine your adrenals react to a

690
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,919
foreign Invader in this case the needle

691
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,559
that adrenaline can power you through

692
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:56,120
the blood test though it's a needle High

693
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,559
keep in mind blood draws take from us

694
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,480
it's not like an intravenous vitamin or

695
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,720
saline bag that offers nourishment to

696
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,880
counterbalance the adrenals during their

697
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,679
fight or flight response this adrenaline

698
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,720
response to the needle alone takes time

699
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,480
to recover for people who are weakened

700
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,960
in sick that calls for any needles or

701
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,839
treatments with needles needles can also

702
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,280
make you high from the adrenaline that's

703
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:28,119
released the medical industry secretly

704
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,919
relies on you getting this high from the

705
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,960
pin prick it Band-Aids the moment the

706
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,240
damage being done with too much blood

707
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,040
being drawn some people feel a temporary

708
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,679
lift like a temporary high as a needle

709
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:47,639
leaves the arm before they feel worse

710
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,800
later as the adrenaline surge wears off

711
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:54,320
check this out if someone gets an injury

712
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,839
and they get cut and they bleed two

713
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,000
three or four vials of blood worth

714
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,960
which is roughly around 40 m of blood F4

715
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,599
vials with 10ml vials right they feel it

716
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,520
they're traumatized can you imagine

717
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:15,839
getting a blood draw of 14 vials even

718
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,240
seven or 10 vials full vials or more

719
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,119
which leads us to the next part

720
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,280
hemorrhagic shock this is an under

721
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,880
studied area and even if it was a

722
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,880
heavily studied area it doesn't mean it

723
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,280
would be solid understood Ironclad it

724
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,240
could still end up as bad as cheap tin

725
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,200
foil research and science is known for

726
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,880
dedicating its resources to areas of

727
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,640
medicine and failing miserably it's why

728
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,960
they don't have any real answers for

729
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,400
chronic illness except for oh yeah I

730
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,280
forgot it's your genes it's all your

731
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,440
genes that's the answer for everything

732
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,480
now it's your jeans what a way out blame

733
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,440
the person don't blame science and

734
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,720
research CH it's your fault when it

735
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,560
comes to blood loss they believe 750 mL

736
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,240
of blood equates to a class one

737
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:12,480
hemorrhagic shock but for what body

738
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,240
weight I'm trying to figure that one out

739
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,800
um what condition someone has and what

740
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,839
body weight it's a heads scratcher again

741
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,880
it's not

742
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:29,160
studied what if you're 100 lb 750 ml

743
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:34,160
could be extreme ragic shock to a person

744
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:37,400
what if you're a 200 lb male and not 130

745
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,839
lb woman what if you're sick chronically

746
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,800
ill and 90 lbs like so many people who

747
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:46,000
get their blood constantly drawn are no

748
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,119
one in science and research are studying

749
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,079
the details or seeing the reality and

750
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,240
possibility of what kind of a effect

751
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,839
this could have on sensitive people

752
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,560
hemorrhagic shock is just a loss of

753
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:02,680
blood which means less oxygen and sugar

754
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,760
to the brain glucose but it means more

755
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,680
than that it means subtle but definite

756
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,200
shocks to other organs and when you lose

757
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,000
your immune cells to a blood draw what

758
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,520
about shock to your bones bone marrow

759
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,480
has to go into rapid production and deep

760
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,480
reserves are lost uh see you later Mrs

761
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,599
Fergenson thanks for giving giving us

762
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,960
all your blood today um hey look out

763
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,200
your bones are going to have to go into

764
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,839
a major workout there they're going to

765
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,920
have to develop a whole bunch of immune

766
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,079
cells fast as heck and uh you better

767
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,160
rest because your bones are freaking out

768
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,040
right now and when you're sick it's a

769
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,640
lot to ask for on your body your immune

770
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,119
systems already up against environmental

771
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,640
toxins pharmaceutical toxins toxic heavy

772
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,200
metals perfumes colon scented candles

773
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,240
air fresheners those are immune system

774
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,640
Busters smile car exhaust

775
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,280
Chemtrails coming out of the sky you're

776
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,359
breathing in when you go outside

777
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,359
pesticides herbicides fungicides

778
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:10,440

petrochemicals Plastics and the biggest

783
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,720
one pathogens so it's a big Demand right

784
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,560
to call upon the bones in your body to

785
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,960
go into Mass production of immune cells

786
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,839
and to drain your spleen reserves of

787
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,200
stored white count your bank your white

788
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,839
blood count Bank you'll get told it's no

789
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,560
big deal no big deal you got plenty of

790
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:44,680
blood and your body will replenish it

791
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,800
the next day there's no definitive scale

792
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,160
that determines hemorrhagic shock

793
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,480
there's no guarantee there's no

794
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,599
guarantee it's perfect sloppy textbook

795
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,160
jargon from the science department once

796
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:02,000
again sloppy means careless understudied

797
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,720
never considered it basically boils down

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,680
to a phrase it's not enough blood to

799
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,160
kill you so who cares so you should be

800
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,880
good chalk it up we never tested their

801
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,800
theory on people to prove what level of

802
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,760
blood missing kills you we never did the

803
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,599
Fine Line testing but I think something

804
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,520
happened like 800 years ago someone

805
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,200
signed up for the experiment they they

806
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,880
walked into somebody

807
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,560
office they cut him bled him to death

808
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,200
and they calculated how much blood it

809
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,920
was that's a long time ago what about

810
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,319
the details we just assume that the

811
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,240
people who have led to death lost around

812
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:47,960
40% which is roughly half gallon of

813
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,599
blood well which is two quarts which is

814
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:55,400
roughly 2,000 milliliters no variables

815
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:59,880
no details no feline

816
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:05,440
definitions pregnant or not pregnant man

817
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:08,160
or woman thin or overweight healthy or

818
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,560
sick total guess workor on hemorrhagic

819
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,560
shock and how much blood it takes to die

820
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,440
also lacking all information and details

821
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,280
on what a healthy person versus someone

822
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,160
who is struggling with a health

823
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,000
condition of any kind with all the

824
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,359
science and research and technology and

825
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,880
factchecking and experts it's just a

826
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:37,079
shot in the dark a dart thrown at a barn

827
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,160
guess work the blood draw world is an

828
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:44,079
empty void of solid facts and data and

829
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,200
evidence and studies dead empty it's a

830
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,520
classic example of a broken system and

831
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,240
people lining up like paddle and sheeple

832
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,680
without any reason to question it uh uh

833
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,200
how much blood do you need um those

834
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,160
tubes are filling up pretty quick I'm

835
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,119
not supposed to question it right no

836
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,200
don't question it ever you guys know

837
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,119
what you're doing you know uh I had an

838
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,520
uncle that knew how much antifreeze it

839
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,640
took to take out of a radiator before

840
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,599
the car overheated I figured you guys

841
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,520
got to know way more than that and how

842
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,440
much blood it takes without hurting me

843
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,040
in any way uh what' you say come back

844
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,000
next month okay we'll do it all again

845
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,119
all right oh I'm done oh thanks oh I

846
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,720
just had a dizzy spell

847
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,280
the abusive nature of blood draw and its

848
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,960
unnecessary consequences is a prime

849
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,680
example of failure and even the best

850
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,680
doctors and health experts walk around

851
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,839
with a blood stain blindfold on let's

852
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:48,079
talk about the Fine Line before you draw

853
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:51,200
blood are you a female or a male women

854
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,599
have a constant revolving immune system

855
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,280
because they have the responsibility of

856
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,119
childbearing continuing human life here

857
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,480
here on Earth women's immune systems

858
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,400
drop in the rest of their body when

859
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,119
they're having their menstrual cycle 80%

860
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,880
of their body's immune system go to the

861
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,240
reproductive system to protect it during

862
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,560
its shedding cycle 40% of a woman's

863
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:19,040
immune system goes to

864
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,400
ovulation 50% of their immune system

865
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,280
goes to pregnancy in over 90% of their

866
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,559
immune system during childbirth it's why

867
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,119
women get symptoms or more symptoms

868
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,200
around these timelines it's why more

869
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,400
women are sick with chronic illness than

870
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,400
men men's immune systems are steady they

871
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,160
have this Advantage when it comes to

872
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,079
health a man can burn their immune

873
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,880
system to the ground yeah and destroy it

874
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,440
many do but it's a steady burn as it

875
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,359
crashes and goes to the ground if a man

876
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:57,200
and a woman get blood drawn for the same

877
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:59,359
problem on the same day the 220 PB male

878
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,880
will get the same amount of blood drawn

879
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:07,319
as the 120 lb woman if it's seven vials

880
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,760
or 14 vials they both get the same same

881
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:13,319
as if they both donated blood they both

882
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,839
get roughly 473 Millers or one pite

883
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:19,760
drawn regardless of their differences

884
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:22,040
that's a huge problem an embarrassment

885
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,640
for the medical system for research in

886
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,599
science it's humiliating for medical

887
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,000
research in science and people are being

888
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,800
trained to believe medical research and

889
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,599
science can do no wrong and that it's

890
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,800
above God the light the universe

891
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,839
whatever you believe in it's a cult at

892
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,440
this point it's become a cult instead of

893
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:49,359
what it should be or once was a work in

894
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,920
progress that has left a trail of

895
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,920
mistakes but perseveres forward let's

896
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,760
talk about your immune system your

897
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,480
immune system fights for you every day

898
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,520
it's gobbling up mold spores poisons

899
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,480
that float in the air other air

900
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,680
contaminants or pathogens like the flu

901
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,359
when a toxic mold Spore enters your

902
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,240
bloodstream a white blood cell has to

903
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:17,480
trap it and consume it gobble gobble it

904
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,480
lessens the lifespan of that immune cell

905
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,760
it weakens it let's talk about if you're

906
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,520
eating out at a restaurant everybody

907
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,880
loves to eat out in restaurants right

908
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,520
it's fun get out enjoy the night or

909
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,440
maybe a lunch out there's contaminants

910
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
in the food that you're eating you're

911
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,160
eating a sandwich from a restaurant

912
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:41,040
breathing in perfume cologne aftershaves

913
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,319
hair products scented body lotions and

914
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,640
oils air fresheners and scented candles

915
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,640
pesticides used for cockroaches and ants

916
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,160
in the kitchen conventional floor

917
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,079
cleaner table cleaner your plate has a

918
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,720
little leftover bleach on it from the

919
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,119
kitchen the waiter was just counting

920
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,440
money before he or she brought over your

921
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,760
plate the lettuce on your sandwich has a

922
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,680
little eoli on it from some raw meat in

923
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,000
the refrigerator that was sitting next

924
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,359
to it the vinegar in your dressing

925
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,599
that's a toxin all on its own coupled

926
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,319
with some sweat drops that contained

927
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,480
some staff or strep flew off the chef's

928
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,839
head along with a little dander filled

929
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,160
with liver toxins that you can't see on

930
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:25,359
your slices of bread or your sandwich

931
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,079
kitchen helpers in the back unpacking

932
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,520
greasy boxes off the delivery truck and

933
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,680
changing out the ice containers touching

934
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,319
the ice and their unwashed hands we're

935
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,760
touching everything in the kitchen

936
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,480
including needing a bathroom stop in

937
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,640
between it all loading boxes and then

938
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,720
having to use the bathroom yeah did they

939
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,520
wash your hands that good nobody knows

940
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,520
they weren't in there with them any

941
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,480
Airborne pathogen such as the flu that

942
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,440
you might breathe in from everybody else

943
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,440
being around in the restaurant your

944
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,880
immune cells they're being poisoned

945
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,440
poisoned fast because they have to

946
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,720
gobble up as much of these chemicals

947
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,079
contaminants and pathogens as they can

948
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,760
in a short amount of time to protect you

949
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,240
while you feel all good in the

950
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,640
restaurant feeling okay eating your

951
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,400
sandwich all is fine all is well an

952
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,280
immune cell can get filled up quick

953
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,559
filled up fast and it slows down

954
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:23,040
sometimes at a stand still it sacrifices

955
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:25,880
its life for you it gets overloaded your

956
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,119
white blood cells the Warriors got their

957
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,839
swords out they're swinging their swords

958
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,240
they're slaying dragons for you they're

959
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:36,040
engulfing multiple toxins and even

960
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,640
pathogens at any given moment when a

961
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,880
white blood cell is overwhelmed and

962
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:44,559
losing a battle two or three others come

963
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,920
to its rescue they got its back there's

964
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,079
communication between white blood cells

965
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,800
just like dolphins in the ocean which is

966
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,800
not even partly understood by research

967
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:58,240
and science but just like a boat can

968
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,520
instantly wipe out about half a dozen

969
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,119
dolphins swimming in the water a school

970
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,079
of white blood cells can get trashed and

971
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:10,200
thrashed hit hard injured and weakened

972
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:12,200
in A Storm of toxins and pathogens or a

973
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,160
larger School white blood cells can

974
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,240
disappear within minutes as you're

975
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,400
getting your blood drawn immune cells

976
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,040
are soldiers they're not indestructible

977
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,160
they can burn out we already have to

978
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,400
deal with that but the health system

979
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,359
trains us to think our blood is

980
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,680
disposable not really important seven

981
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:37,440
vials 10 mlit hey 70 ml here out the

982
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,920
door no problem 3 months later another

983
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,520
seven vials again out the door 3 months

984
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,800
later another seven vials again out the

985
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:49,040
door disposable in 6 months 140 MERS or

986
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:53,200
more disposable and I'm not even talking

987
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:56,280
about a 14 vile blood draw 24 vile blood

988
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,240
draw 30 vile blood draw

989
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,119
even more than that 48 times a year when

990
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,880
you're sick or more out the door how

991
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,520
many schools of immune cells clusters of

992
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,119
immune cells have been removed that's

993
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,200
like schools of

994
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,839
dolphins swimming in the Bermuda

995
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,839
Triangle and just

996
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,880
disappear thrown away without the

997
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:23,000
understanding of what it takes for your

998
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,839
body to reproduce them or what it takes

999
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,520
for your body to keep everything in

1000
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:30,040
check that we just talked about and what

1001
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,760
about when you get your blood drawn

1002
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,359
who's keeping track of what's happening

1003
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,960
in your life at the time you're getting

1004
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,960
your blood drawn did the doctor's office

1005
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,240
ask if you're under any stress where you

1006
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,520
might need your immune system really

1007
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,400
strong is a doctor's office asking you

1008
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,599
if you got enough sleep the night before

1009
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,040
your blood was drawn are they asking you

1010
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,480
how much caffeine you consume coffee

1011
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,160
matcha tea green tea tea black tea

1012
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,640
energy drinks caffeine pills including

1013
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,559
caffeine Pharmaceuticals how much

1014
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,599
chocolate you do because chocolate

1015
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,480
contains caffeine too because caffeine

1016
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,359
breaks down the immune system every day

1017
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,960
weakens it because it's defending itself

1018
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,480
against your adrenal and highs and lows

1019
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,079
like when you down your caffeine and

1020
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,799
chocolate and it ignites your adrenals

1021
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,240
to the overload point and your heart

1022
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:26,839
rate increases as adrenaline floods your

1023
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,160
system adrenaline is so toxic it wears

1024
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:32,799
down your immune system white blood

1025
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,520
cells can get torched by epinephrine

1026
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:37,520
which means they can have a short

1027
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,079
lifespan or shorter lifespan which means

1028
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,359
your bones have to produce more immune

1029
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,119
cells which means your doctor should be

1030
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,480
drawing less blood from you during your

1031
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,520
blood test to account for the stress

1032
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,280
your immune system is under from the

1033
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,559
caffeine alone are you a woman about to

1034
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,760
go into your menstrual cycle or

1035
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,520
ovulation where your immune system is

1036
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,880
about to reduce dramatically in your

1037
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,480
bloodstream and at the same time you're

1038
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,960
eating half a bar of chocolate and three

1039
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,960
cups of coffee a day and in this case

1040
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,359
the doctor's office should want to know

1041
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,160
to account for the amount of VI they're

1042
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:17,400
about to draw but they don't they're not

1043
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,480
asking about anything are you going

1044
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,480
through a divorce a breakup a tough time

1045
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,480
that can have an effect on your immune

1046
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:31,119
system which leads me to another area

1047
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,079
that's important pregnancy when 50% of

1048
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,240
the woman's immune system is protecting

1049
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:38,920
and monitoring the baby leaving her with

1050
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,119
only half of her immune system for the

1051
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,640
rest of her body so when a pregnant

1052
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:47,680
woman gets a blood draw she's losing

1053
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,280
another percentage of her white count

1054
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,799
her immune cells which could be a big

1055
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,920
trigger into postpartum illness of any

1056
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,559
kind and even health issues while

1057
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,559
pregnant and most importantly that blood

1058
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,400
draw could compromise the baby instead

1059
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,640
you'll hear pregnant women have more

1060
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,760
blood and they should come in regularly

1061
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,280
for routine blood tests while pregnant

1062
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,839
doesn't matter how much blood we take

1063
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,920
from them they'll throw away almost all

1064
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:15,240
the blood with the mommy's immune system

1065
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,280
in it which is needed to protect the

1066
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,040
baby with no consideration of how her

1067
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,920
immune system is juggling this depletion

1068
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,280
at some point the body has to rob Peter

1069
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,960
to pay Paul especially when it comes

1070
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,359
down to protecting the baby and then

1071
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,599
there's something else very important to

1072
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,400
consider new relationships sharing

1073
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,760
microorganisms and pathogens from people

1074
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,720
we're living with newer old friendships

1075
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,240
finding new partners in our life to

1076
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,160
share a life with we all have our own

1077
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,000
Petri dishes built inside of us and our

1078
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,880
immune system has to adjust to normal

1079
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,160
circumstances in life with us spending

1080
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,520
time or being around others you may need

1081
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,359
your immune system at its best and

1082
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,799
strongest when you're falling in love or

1083
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,520
moving in with someone to share the rent

1084
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:08,000
and sharing bathrooms and kitchens or

1085
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,319
immune systems adjust to these new

1086
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,839
interactions with others as bacteria and

1087
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:17,319
viruses and fungi cross-contaminate from

1088
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:20,960
person to person it's normal but blood

1089
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:23,960
drawn at the wrong time can happen and

1090
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,799
the doctors they're not inquiring to

1091
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,400
determine how many is safest in that

1092
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:31,359
moment in your life to draw weakening

1093
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,440
the immune system when the immune system

1094
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,559
is already being weakened by protecting

1095
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:40,559
you and keeping you balanced from new

1096
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,920
exposures but details don't matter to

1097
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,280
the alternative and conventional system

1098
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,880
when it comes to drawing blood they

1099
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,240
don't get to know the people good enough

1100
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,960
before they Vamp them Vamp them steal

1101
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,079
their blood throw almost all of it away

1102
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,400
or sell it on the black market to

1103
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,599
experimental

1104
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,640
Labs we act like getting our blood drawn

1105
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,359
is another errand during the day it's

1106
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,839
just another errand let's see um I got

1107
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:13,359
to go to the store I got to get a facial

1108
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:16,240
afterwards um I got to pick up the kids

1109
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,599
from school I got to stop and get 14

1110
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,359
vials of blood

1111
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,200
drawn um I got to get some takeout for

1112
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:27,079
dinner it's just another errand for many

1113
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:31,119
let's talk about donating blood they

1114
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:36,079
take way too much blood in one donation

1115
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:38,200
471 to 473 milliters one pint I'm not

1116
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,599
against donating blood we are always in

1117
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,520
need of it it's a lifesaving tool a

1118
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,640
resource for the people who need blood

1119
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:51,079
transfusions life-saving surgeries from

1120
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:54,799
accidents with that said it's still a

1121
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:57,280
bloody mess no matter who you are when

1122
00:53:54,799 --> 00:54:00,559
you don't donate that much blood you go

1123
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,839
into Uncharted Territory there should be

1124
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,799
parameters and critical guidelines when

1125
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:08,480
donating blood to protect the person

1126
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:11,319
giving the blood and figuring out how

1127
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,440
much blood is safe for them to give any

1128
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:16,000
amount of blood is going to compromise

1129
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,119
them but the goal should be about

1130
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,359
compromising the least possible over a

1131
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,400
dozen variables should be set in place

1132
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:28,280
are you under stress are you sleeping

1133
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,359
are you male or female what's your

1134
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,760
height what's your weight do you plan on

1135
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:36,960
getting pregnant in the next 3 to six

1136
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,880
months are you in a new relationship or

1137
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,680
did you move in with someone new do you

1138
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,760
use or been exposed to colog perfumes

1139
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,559
sended candles air fresheners hair

1140
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,640
products sended lotions aftershave

1141
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:55,559
chemical cleaning supplies have you been

1142
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:58,799
to the dentist recently a female are you

1143
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:01,520
in ovulation or close to menstration do

1144
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:04,799
you have any symptoms did you have

1145
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:09,079
symptoms ever in your life do people

1146
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:11,359
rely on you do loved ones rely on you

1147
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,160
are you driving the next couple of days

1148
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,160
are you hydrated are you jacked up on

1149
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,480
caffeine or chocolate what's your diet

1150
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,240
like why are you donating blood this is

1151
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,039
not even exhausted list in order to

1152
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,480
donate blood they should not make a

1153
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:32,359
standard a pint they should take a half

1154
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,599
pint at a time for a male who's healthy

1155
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:37,720
and strong and less than a half pint for

1156
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,520
a woman depending on many variables

1157
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,559
height weight and everything we

1158
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:45,880
discussed so far because Women's Health

1159
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:48,880
and Men's Health is not the same far

1160
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,839
from it care should be taken to protect

1161
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,359
yourself from exposures after a blood

1162
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:57,640
donation or a blood draw and important

1163
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:59,960
steps should be taken before and after

1164
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,680
to build the blood and Quicken immune

1165
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:06,440
cell production without robbing Peter to

1166
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,440
pay Paul you're still going to have to

1167
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,280
take from Peter and you're still going

1168
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,520
to have to pay Paul but the goal is to

1169
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,640
not leave Peter homeless and you still

1170
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,680
want Paul to get enough look we need

1171
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,359
blood donations but we also have to look

1172
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,640
out for the people who are donating if

1173
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,920
we're giving them a pint of blood let's

1174
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,520
make sure we're strong and healthy and

1175
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,079
we take care of ourselves before and

1176
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:35,880
after donating more on that later let's

1177
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:39,000
talk about blood draws now if you're a

1178
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:43,839
woman who's healthy no symptoms and

1179
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:46,520
strong and above 150 lbs the maximum

1180
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,440
amount of vials they should recommend

1181
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:53,640
should be four whole vials no bigger

1182
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:57,319
than 10 mlit each try to ask for half

1183
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,839
vials and smaller tubes if possible

1184
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:03,160
which becomes two whole vials if you're

1185
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:08,000
healthy and strong under the weight of

1186
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:11,799
150 lbs it should be three whole vials

1187
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,799
try to ask for half vials not whole

1188
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:18,079
vials if you are compromised in any way

1189
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:20,839
with symptoms or condition also

1190
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:26,160
considering the concerns I talked about

1191
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:29,319
earlier maximum ask for two full vials

1192
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,400
best if you do half vials with those two

1193
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:36,000
full vials make sure it's half vials for

1194
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,359
those two which will equal one full vial

1195
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,039
if your health is really compromised and

1196
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:45,839
you're under 100 lb maximum one full

1197
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:48,440
vial and try to ask for a half vial keep

1198
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,319
in mind they throw almost all of your

1199
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,319
blood away very little is needed

1200
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:56,119
regardless of what they tell you they

1201
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:58,559
need ask your doctor doctor if it's okay

1202
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:00,000
if they can take half FS so in the worst

1203
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,000
case scenario you're worried about

1204
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,640
speaking up or they convince you they

1205
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,480
need the amount of vials they need and

1206
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:12,000
they're about to draw five or more vials

1207
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:14,400
ask for half vials the labs will take it

1208
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,520
regardless of what the doctor says or

1209
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,920
the labs say or the FLOTUS says this way

1210
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,920
if you're pressured into 14 vials like

1211
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,720
so many are pressured into by

1212
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,720
specialists it would only equal seven

1213
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,559
vials when they are half filled this is

1214
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,520
still too much blood drawn especially

1215
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,000
for someone who's sick with symptoms or

1216
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,039
a chronic illness but it can help

1217
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,680
protect the person avoiding large blood

1218
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,960
draws is the best thing to do if the

1219
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,119
doctor allows for half files to be

1220
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,920
filled and sends them to the blood lab

1221
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,400
the blood lab will receive them and

1222
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,839
follow through with the testing the

1223
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,680
blood lab may say to the doctors's

1224
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:01,680
office we want full vials so we can do

1225
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,760
additional tests later on not true once

1226
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,920
they run those tests they don't go back

1227
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,000
to that blood you have to get another

1228
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,240
blood test if something went wrong at

1229
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,720
the blood lab this happens all the time

1230
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:17,400
you get a call from the doctor's office

1231
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:20,200
hello what I need to come back in again

1232
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:24,880
for another blood test uh something

1233
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:27,599
happened at the lab um oh okay and you

1234
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,640
have to come in for a few more vials if

1235
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,960
you do have to go back in ask for half

1236
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,559
vials and give yourself a little time

1237
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,680
between to recoup doctors tend to try to

1238
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:43,039
get as many tests done in one blood draw

1239
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:46,000
as possible if this requires more than

1240
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:49,119
four full vials of blood for a healthy

1241
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,760
person and more than 1 to three full

1242
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,079
vials of blood for a person who's

1243
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,920
struggling with a health condition then

1244
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:58,440
you have the option of asking to to

1245
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,480
separate or divide the tests and to come

1246
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,480
back another day for additional blood

1247
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,119
draws for additional tests breaking them

1248
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:09,680
up so it's not a shock on your immune

1249
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,839
system taking at least 5 days between

1250
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:16,000
blood draws is best unless it's more

1251
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:18,599
urgent then sooner is an option there's

1252
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,520
a lot of wastage and mistakes made at

1253
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:25,520
the blood Labs they're blood hungry it's

1254
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:28,559
a machine they're like wolves a

1255
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,280
bloodthirsty machine it's not the people

1256
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,559
working there at the blood Labs that are

1257
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,559
the problem they're great they're mostly

1258
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,720
good people doing critical life-saving

1259
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,920
work it's not the doctor's fault they're

1260
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,359
not the problem it's the system that

1261
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:48,400
shrouds them it's broken it hasn't been

1262
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:52,400
upgraded adjusted checked in over 80

1263
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,079
years it's Antiquated even if the tests

1264
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,160
become more advanced as medic medicine

1265
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,760
advances it's like that decked out car

1266
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:04,119
that's got Wi-Fi it still has rubber

1267
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,280
tires gets a flat in the end because he

1268
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:09,359

Health and the level of stress on

1274
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:25,920
doctors watching patients get sicker and

1275
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,119
deteriorate without realizing in it that

1276
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,200
because of the blood draws it's one of

1277
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,960
the biggest triggers to prolonging

1278
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,559
chronic illness let's talk about other

1279
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,559
forms of support if you're someone who

1280
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:40,640
knows your blood draws scheduled you

1281
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,400

1283
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,960
a surprise at the doctor's office that

1284
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,599
you're unaware of that day like you

1285
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,760
visit the doctor you're sitting there

1286
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,680
and they're like hey let's take some

1287
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,279
blood then there's a lot of great things

1288
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,760
you can do to prep one week Advance is

1289
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:02,400
an ideal place to start if you're a

1290
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:05,599
woman try to time your blood draw before

1291
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,200
you enter menstration ideally a week

1292
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:11,000
after your cycle even a week before your

1293
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,839
cycle because at these times your immune

1294
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,839
system is strongest in your whole body

1295
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:19,240
hydration is an ideal way of helping

1296
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:21,680
your immune system stay strong before

1297
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,760
you get the blood draw so starting a

1298
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,880
week before you get your blood test

1299
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,079
reduce or eliminate your caffeine intake

1300
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,400
if you regularly participate in it

1301
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:34,279
caffeine is extremely dehydrating no

1302
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,680
matter how much water and juices you're

1303
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:40,920
consuming it dehydrates the cells your

1304
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:44,039
hydration never gets to a maximum level

1305
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,119
because caffeine sucks a person dry

1306
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:50,000
during this week incorporate celery

1307
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:52,400
juice 16 to 32 ounces every morning do

1308
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,160
not add anything to that celery juice no

this brings in calcium vitamin C and

1313
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:11,839
other critical trace minerals glucose

1314
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:16,480

percentage of fat residing in it like

1337
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:29,760

you can't plan a week ahead of your

1355
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,520
blood test then try to apply this days

1356
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:26,359
before even if it's just one day before

1357
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:29,599

1362
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:45,400
after a blood draw two apples a day

1363
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,240

these food tips applied before and after

1366
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,400
a blood draw will be helpful do do the

1367
01:05:54,279 --> 01:06:00,760
best you can even if it's just getting

1368
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,359
your celery juice in Daily so the sodium

1369
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,359
cluster salts can really charge up those

1370
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:08,160
electrolytes in those neurotransmitters

1371
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:12,000
as needed now let's talk about some

1372
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,520
helpful supplements before and after hey

1373
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,119
you can check with your doctor see if

1374
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,119
it's right for you the supplements I

1375
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,599
recommend are the ones that I use for

1376
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:22,680
myself they don't have any alcohol no

1377
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:24,559
natural flavors no preservatives the

1378
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,400
cleanest and the best quality it's the

1379
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,599
vimergy company they have something

1380
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,920
called micro it's a form of vitamin C

1381
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,119
for your immune system support vitamin C

1382
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,200
is critical because your immune system

1383
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:39,000
needs it more than ever because a part

1384
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,920
of your immune system was drawn out of

1385
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,880
your body with the blood draw another

1386
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:48,559
supplement liquid zinc sulfate from

1387
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,440
vimer G2 zinc is to support the immune

1388
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,279
system that's going to be left over so

1389
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,160
as part of your immune system is lifted

1390
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:58,520
out of your body removed and thrown away

1391
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,400
the part that's left needs the zinc more

1392
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:04,680
than ever zinc also keeps viruses doile

1393
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,400
so they don't proliferate so

1394
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:10,599
easily there's also liquid

1395
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:12,760
B12 form of adinos silk bamin and

1396
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:16,200
methylcobalamin that's something I take

1397
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:18,160
and Trust greatly the right B12 supports

1398
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,480
all bodily functions especially the

1399
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,960
brain function the reason why I like the

1400
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,240
vimer gb12 It doesn't have the

1401
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,279
preservatives in it the citric acid the

1402
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,920
alcohol the natural flavors and other

1403
01:07:27,279 --> 01:07:32,799
stuff they throw in all the other junky

1404
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,920
companies when a tree is ready to be

1405
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:39,400
planted and taken out of its container

1406
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,520
or root ball it goes into shock as you

1407
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,520
place that tree into the Earth to plant

1408
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:48,359
you want to slow its shock down you must

1409
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,160
give it a feeding a range of nutrients

1410
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:55,960
that includes even B vitamins for faster

1411
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:58,960
recovery B12 is that shock Buster for us

1412
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,000
it feeds us so when we're uprooted like

1413
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,240
when we're getting the blood draw our

1414
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,279
body gets the shock and we need to take

1415
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:10,079
care of our body so the shock is eased

1416
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:13,799
so it's less of a shock also magnesium

1417
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:16,080
glycinate helps to ease any nerve spasms

1418
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:18,600
that are affected from the missing

1419
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,679
magnesium that disappears when we get

1420
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,759
the blood draw after blood draws muscles

1421
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:27,040
tend to tighten spasm and

1422
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:29,920
twitch if you have other supplement

code and messaging in our blood that

1440
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:24,279

they believe is in our

1445
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:38,839
DNA the evildoers on the planet know

1446
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:41,600
there is information inside our blood

1447
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:44,319
they just haven't cracked it they've

1448
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:47,279
been experimenting with our blood since

1449
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,640
World War I trying to make sense out of

1450
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:54,360
it and at the same time pretending it's

1451
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:57,560
all for us and our health and well-being

1452
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:01,679
if they had access to the secrets inside

1453
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:05,199
of us they would gain more control over

1454
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:08,440
the human race they would clone humans

1455
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:12,360
at a rate that would surpass all

1456
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:15,360
imagination where does all our blood go

1457
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:18,800
it's not used in the blood tests some

1458
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:21,560
believe it goes down the drain there's a

1459
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,520
great possibility it goes straight to

1460
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:27,480
medical testing for reasons that are

1461
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,480
totally

1462
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,920
insane
