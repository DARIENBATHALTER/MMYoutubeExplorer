00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,959
your loom Tomatoes you guys know what

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,120
they're like it's an experience beyond

76
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,680
all other and I don't need to be high on

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,879
weed to know that those are that good

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,480

food processor ready we're going to make

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,159
pasta because pasta is how you make mac

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,040
and cheese that's a big part of it you

86
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,799
have I I think so I think that's what

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
you got to do you got to make pasta in

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,400
order to make mac and cheese right yes

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
yes all right let's talk about the

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,159
marijuana stuff let's get into it we

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,959
might even do little demo stuff with my

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,280
dummy right about how when weed goes

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,159
into you and goes into your system

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,239
what's going on okay and let's get into

95
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,360
it

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,159
so

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,560
marijuana is toxic for a lot of reasons

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,439
one of the big reasons is it's it's high

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,400
in toxic heavy

100
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:10,079
metals high in toxic heavy metals toxic

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,920
Metals overall just high in it why is

102
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:18,040
that how does it work for one weed

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:22,120
growers marijuana growers they cut

104
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Corners they cut Corners all bets are

105
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,400
off no regulations know anything I'm

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,360
talking about some of the most

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
respectable weed

108
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,759
Growers out there in the world they cut

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,479
Corners so they need their weed to grow

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,880
they need the buds to be

111
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,479
big they need their weed to grow and

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,240
they need their buds to be big that's

113
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,759
what they need in order to make those

114
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,880
big buds they need

115
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,639
fertilizer without

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,320
fertilizer you don't get the big

117
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,560
buds you need fertilizer for the big

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,240
buds but Growers are

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,080
cheap cheapos in the worst way that's

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,520
notoriously how they are they don't want

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,600
to spend the money on the good

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,039
fertilizer and fertilizer is real priced

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,080
up so right now weed is going to be even

124
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
higher in toxic heavy metals in the

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,039
coming next couple of years like we're

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
talking like you smoke weed you're

127
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,080
filling your tank with toxic heavy

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
metals so let's get into the fertilizer

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,479
thing what goes on with that first of

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
all they need the cheap way out they

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,720
don't want to buy

132
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,720
fertilizers and they don't want to buy

133
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,800
the resources to make their own

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,960
fertilizers the good stuff they don't

135
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
want to buy

136
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,560
seaweeds they don't want you know

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,960
manures from reputable

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,800
places they get manures in massive boat

139
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:02,199
loads from guess where you know it the

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,000
industrial cow center of the world

141
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:09,280
industrialized Cow Patties that's what

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
they use and begin with just so you know

143
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,319
industrialized cows are filled with

144
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,080
drugs they're filled with antibiotics

145
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,479
they're filled with all kinds of

146
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,280
different Pharmaceuticals they're shot

147
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,479
up left and right with antibiotics and

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,199
pharmaceuticals and antifungals

149
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,400
antifungal just for the record are

150
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,160
really high in toxic heavy metals and

151
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,120
other toxins and poison

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,400
okay so the Manu that marijuana growers

153
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,880
use are loaded with antifungal

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,000
medications keep this in mind right here

155
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
how this works that manure is also

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
loaded in

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,080
antibiotic

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,520
medications these are just two another

159
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,440
thing too is conventional cows get

160
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,840
inflammation to the point where they

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,520
swell so if you go to an industrialized

162
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,440
you know uh ranch right they're kind

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,479
they're all caged up they're all locked

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,759
up you're talking about industrial meat

165
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,560
right the real thing okay the cows are

166
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,280
swollen their legs are swelling their

167
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,680
organs are swelling they don't last long

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
before they get butchered they can't

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,800
hang long they get too sick organs are

170
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,160
swelling so they pump them with

171
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,560
anti-inflammatories so all that

172
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,879
anti-inflammatory goes into the cow pad

173
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,360
you guys get what I'm saying into the

174
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:33,840
cow manure that's the cow manure weed

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,680
grow weed growers actually use it's a c

176
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,560
manure from the industrial center of the

177
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,919
world of

178
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,440
cows and then that manure right there

179
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,960
filled with antifungals

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,400
anti-inflammatories

181
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,440
antibiotics and other medications and

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,840
other

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Pharmaceuticals is in that manure and

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,520
high in that manure the other thing is

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,039
the feed right all the feed that's being

186
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,560
used highly sprayed sprayed feed just

187
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:05,159
for the record here this is critical to

188
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,840
know that weed growers don't use

189
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,800
organic like organic everything like no

190
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,440
high like high quality highly reputable

191
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,960
organic manur and fertilizers they don't

192
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,720
do that they use the lowest of the

193
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,280
lowest of the lowest they even concoct

194
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,599
and make their own and we're going into

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,879
that next part in a minute because you

196
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,879
can't miss out on this some good stuff

197
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,200
let's get into it a little bit

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:37,360
so maners are a big part of how weed the

199
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,959
buds are loaded with toxic heavy

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,399
metals because of the antifungals and

201
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,720
the antibiotics and the

202
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,680
anti-inflammatories but that's just one

203
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,120
place and then it's the feed for the

204
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,320
cows that are laced in the pesticides

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,720
and the rodenticides and everything else

206
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,200
the weed killer and everything else

207
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,000
that's in the grain that's fed to those

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,320
cows

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,040
and then the

210
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,920
manure is highly toxic highly loaded

211
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,760
with metals and that manure is

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,720
purchased for very little money like

213
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,680
dirt cheap and a lot of times weed

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,480
growers make deals where they're

215
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,399
actually bartering with weed for cow

216
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,800
manure and they get the lowest grade

217
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,200
bulk crap cow manure there is on the

218
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,839
planet and they barter with weed for Cal

219
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,600
manure that's a practice that does

220
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,440
happen out there you might be saying not

221
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,160
my weed grower not mine in my state not

222
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,680
my you know whatever my weed grower

223
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,440
never does that they tell me they got

224
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,320
the best care for it they do this they

225
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,600
do that but I'm sorry but I highly

226
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,120
doubted it's highly unlikely maybe some

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,480
Homespun weed grower somewhere some

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,200
little Homespun weed weed grower that's

229
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,120
actually growing some weed for

230
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,440
themselves or something or trying to

231
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,640
start up a business legally or whatever

232
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,079
right

233
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,399
and they're starting out and they want

234
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,600
the best for the best for their plants

235
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
but once you get into it for a little

236
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
bit and you look at the bottom line and

237
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,680
you're watching your Dollar Bottom uh-uh

238
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,200
it all changes fast and then you hear

239
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,519
about practices that the weed growers

240
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,279
are doing the big weed growers are doing

241
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,920
and those practice is are the only way

242
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,160
to survive it's a big part of how the

243
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:28,120
weed industry works so you get a bud bud

244
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,720
looks great but it's toxic very toxic

245
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,279
just go into something a little bit

246
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,800
deeper on this people who smoke weed are

247
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,760
already high and toxic heavy metals

248
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,240
there's very few people who are smoking

249
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
weed they have a need for weed if they

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
have a need for weed they're high in

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,639
toxic heavy metals because toxic heavy

252
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
metals Mercury aluminum copper all of

253
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,600
that lead everything that's inside our

254
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,360
brains when we have too much of it

255
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,800
patched out in different areas too much

256
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,560
of it in different places in the brain

257
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,639
what happens we start getting depression

258
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
we start getting the depersonalization

259
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,880
we start getting the anxiety attacks and

260
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,440
you yes you can have pathogens involved

261
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
pathogens love metals and you can have a

262
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,040
combination of both but what I'm trying

263
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,600
to tell you is is the bipolar the

264
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,639
schizophrenia the depression the sadness

265
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,880
the all of the above and

266
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,200
more okay emotional not feeling good

267
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,440
feeling bad not feel feeling unwell

268
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,240
feeling sick in any way plus people who

269
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,480
are suffering too in different ways not

270
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,040
just emotionally and mentally but in

271
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,079
physically and they smoke weed to try to

272
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
curve everything curve the emotional

273
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,519
pain curve the mental pain and physical

274
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,440
pain to some degree they're high in

275
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,160
toxic heavy metals people who smoke weed

276
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,519
are already really high in toxic heavy

277
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,800
metals so then they're smoking or using

278
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,880
weed or eating weed or however you know

279
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,480
some new way of taking weed comes into

280
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,040
town whatever it is they're adding on to

281
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
their heavy metals so the metals that

282
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,200
they're getting from their weed is

283
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,160
actually going into the metals is mixing

284
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
into the metals that are in their brain

285
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,000
and it's adding to it so they're smoking

286
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
weed and it's kind of dumbing down their

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,760
pain and sorrow and then the weed wears

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,519
off and then boom they're back to square

289
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,639
one you got to smoke the weed again

290
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,399
dumbs down the pain and sorrow back to

291
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,000
square one when it wears off boom you

292
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,600
got to do it again dumbs down the pain

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,199
and sorrow wears off boom you're back to

294
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
doing it again right the Vicious Cycle

295
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,680
of weed the Vicious Cycle of marijuana

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,279
use it's you just and I'm not judging

297
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,279
anybody on this at all that's not what

298
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,720
this

299
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,639
is that's not what this is at all right

300
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
but you you have this thing where

301
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,079
everybody goes up and down it becomes a

302
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,120
vicious cycle and that vicious cycle is

303
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,680
hard to break out of because people feel

304
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,600
like they need the weed to calm things

305
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,839
down emotionally what's happening

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,320
instead is what they do not know is

307
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,920
they're dealing with toxic heavy metals

308
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,519
inside themselves in their liver in

309
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,000
their brain in their body in their

310
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,440
organs mostly in their brain creating a

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,360
problem which leads them to a place

312
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,320
where they want weed to begin with it

313
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,399
leads them to to a place where hey I

314
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
need to smoke

315
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
marijuana but the problem here with

316
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,240
marijuana is it's really high in toxic

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,839
heavy metals and it's really high

318
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,040
intoxic heavy metals adding to their

319
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,800
problem slowly over time but adding to

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
their problem slowly over time so let's

321
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,279
get into fertilizer a little bit

322
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,279
fertilizer might be

323
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,600
a boring ass topic but when it comes

324
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,680
down to weed it's not

325
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,279
boring so what most weed growers do

326
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,920
the we grower near

327
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,440
you is they use their own urine to

328
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,440
fertilize now before you B at the old

329
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,320
your own urine to fertilize thing I'm

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,399
not ripping that up totally back to the

331
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,839
Landers have used

332
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,720
urine for their

333
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,440
fertilizer

334
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,560
for dozens and dozens and dozens of

335
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,680
years however you want to say it urine

336
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,199
has been a fertilizer a staple for

337
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,560
people who are trying to survive grow

338
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,560
their own food food and they use

339
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,240
urine to feed their food their growing

340
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,959
food the nitrogen from their own

341
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,720
urine can actually help support your

342
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,759
garden now that's your own urine right

343
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
that's

344
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,920
yours the weeds you're

345
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,959
smoking is a whole bunch of other

346
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,040
people's

347
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,120
urine people that you probably wouldn't

348
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,199
want to ever meet

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,959
someday probably the people that you

350
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,600
would probably not want to run across

351
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,959
someday they're uring so what they do is

352
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,040
they contain it so in weed operations

353
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,920
everybody who has to take a leak is not

354
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,440
allowed to go take a leak on the edge of

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,959
the the marijuana field they're not

356
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,880
allowed to take a leak on the edge of

357
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,040
the woods they're not allowed to use the

358
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,279
bathroom when it comes down to

359
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,759
urination so they can't just go into a

360
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,000
bathroom and urinate most weed growers

361
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,519
have a rule the rule is it's got to go

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,720
into a vet or a jug it's got to be

363
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,199
stored and everybody's urine gets stored

364
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,839
for the weed growth

365
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,040
process

366
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,959
now sure you got your own little farm

367
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,759
Farmstead Homestead you got your little

368
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,399
you're back to the land you're growing

369
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,560
your garden and you want to use your

370
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,199
urine for your own plants you want to

371
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,759
know how to use it you mix it with water

372
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,600
you thin it out a little bit you got

373
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,399
your your fertilizer you got your

374
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,519
nitrogen I'm not ranking on that idea or

375
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,720
that concept I understand it well and I

376
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,000
know it

377
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,360
well problem is with the weed rowing

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,920
situation the industry is it's urine fed

379
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,519
that's what it is now what I don't like

380
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,920
about that for the weed industry is ur

381
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,639
in fed from people that are highly

382
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,800
toxic people that aren't eating good

383
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,199
people that actually are in high in

384
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,519
toxic heavy metals people that are

385
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,079
drinking energy drinks out of cans all

386
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
day while they're harvesting weed while

387
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,560
they're growing the weed while they're

388
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
nurturing their weed and they're

389
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,199
drinking out of they're just drinking

390
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,680
energy drinks out of aluminum cans and

391
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:16,040
all kinds of toxins and everything

392
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,800
else and even with all that they're

393
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,519
exposed to Metals in so many other ways

394
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,079
we can't even imagine I've taught about

395
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,319
this for years toxic heavy metal

396
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,839
exposure and how that

397
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:30,040
works

398
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:33,000
so the urine fertilizer that basically

399
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,680
runs the gamma of the weed

400
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,319
industry is highly toxic and filled with

401
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,240
toxic heavy metals it's not just filled

402
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,800
with some syphilis here and there it's

403
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
not just filled with some Epstein bar

404
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,199
here and there it's not just filled with

405
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,560
a little gonorrhea it's not just filled

406
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,759
with a little chyia it's not just filled

407
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,880
with some shingles and it's not just

408
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,279
filled with some strep it's not just

409
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,279
filled with some staff or some some

410
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,360
serious antibiotic resistant Mera and

411
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,000
strep and Seed if it's not just filled

412
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
with that that goes into those Vats

413
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,640
because that's what the urine all has in

414
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,839
it and that all goes into the ground

415
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,919
there to grow your weed it's not just

416
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,079
that it's filled with toxic heavy

417
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,319
metals and so many other different

418
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,280
toxins and

419
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,280
poisons and so that's how the weed

420
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,120
industry Works each Farm has their own

421
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,079
dog Day

422
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,799
rules you work there you learn pretty

423
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,840
quick doesn't matter how kind of

424
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,080
hippie-ish or kind of homegrown the

425
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,440
people are how nice the people are they

426
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,880
got their rules and a lot of their rules

427
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,200
are is this is what we're going to use

428
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,720
for fertilizer we're going to use the

429
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,840
urine we're going to use the cheapest

430
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,400
comve you've ever seen on this planet it

431
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,280
doesn't matter grow those buds no one

432
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,760
gives a freak it doesn't matter who

433
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,960
smokes it whatever as long as that boom

434
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,720
that content is there as long as that

435
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,480
bud is powerful as long as that Gene of

436
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,039
that plant is strong it doesn't matter

437
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,960
it's where it's at so let's go into

438
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,919
another realm of why toxic heavy metals

439
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,600
are in in weed and I've been talking

440
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,320
about this years versus anything else

441
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,320
they can't use weed

442
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,159
killer to dumb down the

443
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,600
weeds I don't know if you guys get my

444
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,080
drift on this at

445
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,559
all they can't just take a weed killer

446
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,440
and spray the field because even

447
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,679
marijuana resistant weed killers

448
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,679
or so forth where they don't kill

449
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,600
marijuana still damage marijuana so they

450
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,919
can't really so they have to rely on

451
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,640
other means of keeping the weeds down

452
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,799
and that means row covers so people

453
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,159
don't realize is a lot of Road a lot of

454
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,080
row covers are loaded with toxins

455
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,200
poisons they're loaded with Metals

456
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,240
they're loaded with plastics that are

457
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
unstable so I got to tell you something

458
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,280
about row covers row covers have a

459
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
different form of plastic they have one

460
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,640
where it's actually really unstable

461
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,159
breaks down really fast and and so

462
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,960
marijuana growers can't really keep the

463
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,600
weeds under control underneath their

464
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,200
marijuana plants because you can't kill

465
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,480
those weeds with those weed killers cuz

466
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,799
you're going to end up killing your weed

467
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,360
and so they have to go with other means

468
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,039
of dealing with and controlling their

469
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:23,520
weed growth with their crops I know it's

470
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,840
confusing I'm talking about weeds versus

471
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
marijuana so the row covers go down

472
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,840
that's one thing another thing is they

473
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,440
use aluminum container ERS so we Growers

474
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,159
most of the time use aluminum containers

475
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,280
to Harbor their plants the roots of the

476
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,120
plants go up against aluminum containers

477
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,760
they're really high in

478
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,640
aluminum it's another thing that happens

479
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,080
too all these things matter when it

480
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
comes down to farming and it's all part

481
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,280
of why the toxic heavy metals are so

482
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,320
high in weed and

483
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,240
marijuana medical mum information called

484
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
the shot first talked about it for

485
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,280
years

486
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,840
years about how weed is loaded with

487
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,400
toxic heavy metals but nobody knew it

488
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,760
and it was never tested just recently

489
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,880
they started testing some weed and they

490
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,520
found it's high in toxic heavy metals

491
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,400
and everybody's got like a question mark

492
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,080
above their head and they're like what

493
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,760
how what

494
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,480
why I wasn't testing it I wasn't

495
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,640
starting a scientific study it comes

496
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,039
with Spirit of compassion and constantly

497
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Spirit of compassion is proven right

498
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,799
proven right proven right so many times

499
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,440
to make your head been we have hundreds

500
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:35,520
now hundreds documented of s so's

501
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,159
information first and then someone

502
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
taking the idea from s so like whoa it

503
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,280
does have toxines let's what does have

504
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,919
the metals Let's test weed now and see

505
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,919
what it has in

506
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,200
it so let's dig a little deeper into

507
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
weed for a second but let's just do a

508
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,840
little check right here on what we have

509
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,840
going

510
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,840
on

511
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,360
so another thing too is there there the

512
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,880
whole thing it's not just about testing

513
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,799
weed it's going to be

514
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
testing it's not going to be about

515
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,559
testing weed it's going to be about

516
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,559
testing other things too like

517
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,679
people so that's the next thing like why

518
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,080
are people who smoke weed higher in

519
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,440
toxic heavy metals why is that happening

520
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,559
what's going on they're going to put two

521
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,000
and two together and they're still not

522
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,559
going to know why until they hear this

523
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
live so when someone hears this

524
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,360
live or here's a video that I put out

525
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,799
with this information on it or however

526
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,279
they're going to start testing people

527
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,679
and start testing people and as they're

528
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,679
testing

529
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,279
people they're going to find they in

530
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,320
their high in toxic heavy

531
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,120
metals so yeah interesting all on its

532
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,720
own all right so I just want to talk

533
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,240
about what we're making real quick you

534
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
guys just got on here we're making baked

535
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,200
mac and cheese we're having a really

536
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,600
good talk as well now there's no no

537
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,080
judgment on anybody who smokes weed

538
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,440
there's no judgment on anybody who

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,240
actually um smokes

540
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
marijuana but we're making some baked

541
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,679
mac and cheese in a little bit we're

542
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,200
making a salad as well I think I might

543
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,760
start heading there as we speak or we're

544
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,440
going to cover a little bit more

545
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,520
information on

546
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
this so if you want to grow your own

547
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,440
chickens in the backyard and you want

548
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,120
your chickens like really

549
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,640
pure really clean really organic you got

550
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,120
your chickens out there free-ranging it

551
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,159
and they're picking out bugs and they're

552
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,279
picking out things in the grass right

553
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,600
they're picking at things in the pen you

554
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,600
let them go if you got a little bit of

555
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,440
land and you let you let those chickens

556
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,279
roll those chickens will be picking off

557
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,120
stuff left and right right they're

558
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,559
getting this incredible diet of wild

559
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,360
food so your chickens your free range

560
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,480
chickens are actually getting all that

561
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,000
wild

562
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,919
food that's what's going on so when you

563
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,720
go and you go eat your chicken you're

564
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,200
like well I know the food I fed my

565
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,640
chicken chicken the problem is like with

566
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
weed it's not like organic farming and

567
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
even that can get questionable sometimes

568
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,159
but it's not like organic farming when

569
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,360
you got organic lettuce or you got

570
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,120
organic food that you just purchased

571
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,760
there's regulations that are really

572
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,559
strict with that even though there's

573
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,919
still fine lines and nuances and

574
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,919
everything else but there's still a lot

575
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,000
of strictness to

576
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,559
that so but when it comes down to the

577
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,360
whole weed thing it really doesn't work

578
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,799
like that so you can't take a group

579
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,480
group of every group of people that

580
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,480
work at a weed farm you can't Coral them

581
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,360
up in a pen and make them eat organic

582
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,440
food only make them eat this make them

583
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
eat that make them do this you know

584
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,679
they're not allowed to take any

585
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,600
Pharmaceuticals they're not allowed to

586
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,480
do this you can't Corral a whole ton of

587
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,000
people you can't go around the country

588
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,400
and around the world round up all the

589
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,840
farmers that grow weed and all their

590
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
workers and tell them that they're just

591
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,000
going to be going out in that field and

592
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,159
they're just going to be picking away at

593
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
Wild foods and wild bugs and they're

594
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,080
going to have this diet that's super

595
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,360
clean and no Pharmaceuticals and no and

596
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,640
no energy drinks or whatever else you

597
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,159
can't do that to

598
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,520
people so then all their urine that's

599
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,240
going into the

600
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,960
fertilizers are not like monitored that

601
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,320
urine is not monitored so when you go

602
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,880
and you consume that weed or eat it or

603
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,000
smoke it or whatever there was really

604
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
nothing there

605
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,720
to create a boundary of protection

606
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,039
instead you know when you got your own

607
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,240
chickens you know what you're feeding

608
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,039
your

609
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,520
chickens you don't want to go to

610
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,000
somebody else's house and they kill a

611
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,559
chicken in their backyard and they tell

612
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,120
you well here's what we feed our

613
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,640
chickens guess what we feed our chickens

614
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,279
we feed our chickens a whole bunch of

615
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,600
crap like a whole bunch of toxic stuff

616
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,320
and everything else here you are eating

617
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,640
their chicken and you're just like uh I

618
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,679
don't want to eat this

619
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,440
chicken I want a chicken in a controlled

620
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:02,279
enough environment where that chicken is

621
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,360
actually eating wild bugs eating seeds

622
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,600
eating anything else it can find in that

623
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,600
dirt that keeps it healthy that keeps it

624
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,120
pure at its purest form there's always

625
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,840
going to be tox heavy metals everywhere

626
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,520
they fall out of the sky but even beyond

627
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,320
that I'm just saying the cleanest you

628
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,960
can get with what this Earth

629
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,200
offers with what's happening with this

630
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:31,080
Earth so this isn't like an insult to

631
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,320
people who use weed medicinally

632
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,840
medically where they use it because they

633
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,880
feel like they need it they use it for

634
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,679
things they need it's not about that at

635
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,039
all this is just

636
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,919
about the mere understanding of how it

637
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,799
goes what's going on and maybe this talk

638
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,440
changes the system over time and maybe

639
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,559
down the road people who are actually

640
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,640
consuming weed will consume weed that's

641
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,440
not high in toxic heavy metals and how

642
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
about that wouldn't that be

643
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,200
great and maybe we actually have care

644
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,760
about it if people really believe in

645
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,360
their weed and use their weed they

646
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,960
actually the system can change a little

647
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,720
bit as it goes along where that stuff is

648
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
clean already there's people out there

649
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,600
like it's the miracle it's the miracle

650
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,039
medicine weed's the miracle medicine

651
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,880
it's the greatest stuff there is there's

652
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,559
nothing better than that it can fix

653
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,760
anything it can cure anything we cure

654
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,399
anything you know the people say that

655
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,919
stuff they say that stuff all the time

656
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,840
and they do that whole thing CBD CBD

657
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,720
weed weed weed CBD weed whatever and

658
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,440
everybody's just freaking out like no

659
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,840
it's the miracle hemp hemp hemp it's the

660
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,120
miracle

661
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,960
medicines meanwhile it's loaded with

662
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,520
toxic stuff highly toxic which adds to

663
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,200
the problem to begin with of why

664
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,080
somebody's even suffering to begin with

665
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,760
so it's almost like what how does that

666
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,559
work so maybe the system will change

667
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
someday they're already taking an

668
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,919
interest in looking into weed having

669
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,360
toxic heavy metals because of mm info

670
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,960
now they're going to be looking into how

671
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,039
people are you know are they highend

672
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,520
metals that actually smoke weed and and

673
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,840
they're going to start and maybe down

674
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,440
the road they're going to start looking

675
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,159
at growing practices and find out really

676
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,480
why everything's so cheap skated

677
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,120
everything's so Cheapo and then to the

678
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,880
point where people are just dumping

679
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,480
their own urine into the crops because

680
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,399
they're just trying to create a bud no

681
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,640
matter what high water or hell and it

682
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,000
gets done and that's it so let's start

683
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,399
making some

684
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,760
food and there's plenty more to talk

685
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,159
about talk about weed than that plenty

686
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,640
more about how it's not good for the

687
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,799
brain actually it's actually bad for the

688
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,440
brain something that's very important to

689
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,799
know I'm going to drop some pasta in

690
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,480
here if you guys don't

691
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,200
mind so this is 3 lbs I'm probably going

692
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,399
to just leave a half a pound out maybe

693
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,799
I'll do

694
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,880
that me I might be able to do all three

695
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,880
pounds in here let's take a

696
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,279
look there we

697
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,279
go I'm going to add a little bit more

698
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,120
for it there you don't want to overcook

699
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,600
your pasta when you're doing this so

700
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,440
keep that in mind you don't want to

701
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,120
overcook your pasta that's one thing

702
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,480
that's really really important because

703
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,080
if you overcook your pasta then you're

704
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,760
going to have just kind of like mush

705
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,080
it's not going to be firm it's not going

706
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,000
to hold itself up and that is going to

707
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,399
be a problem all on its own so kind of

708
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,399
just a reminder for people who

709
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,080
actually I mean but unless you like your

710
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,200
pasta mushy and and if that's the case

711
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,000
that's awesome totally awesome if you

712
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:37,240
want to do that why not a lot of

713
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,399
people a lot of people um like their

714
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,559
pasta overdone

715
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,200
overcooked this is going to cook fast

716
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm going to remind myself every couple

717
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,480
of minutes I'm just going to double

718
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,919
check let's get that

719
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,120
going

720
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,120
okay all

721
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,240
right now I know when you talk negative

722
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,919
in any way any way with marijuana you

723
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,480
just get like hit like it's like people

724
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
just get so upset they're highly

725
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,039
protected they're like pites they're

726
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,360
like Watchdogs over it and they're

727
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:13,039
highly protected protective over it but

728
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,840
by no means is this an insult towards it

729
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,559
it's just information that I think that

730
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,080
everybody should know I mean I think

731
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,720
it's everybody's right to

732
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,880
know yeah a question right there what

733
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,880

hot right here I'm going to move this

746
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,440
okay I'm going to get the skins off of

747
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,840
here too now these are already

748
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,000
steamed they're already

749
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:15,880
preheated these are

750
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,679
warm the oven's preheated the 400 right

751
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,840
now let's go find a nice spot here there

752
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,480
we are look at that how much room we

753
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,760
have today on The Cutting Board let's

754
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,320
just go here now I take the skin off the

755
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,600
potato because you don't want the skin

756
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,000
on there because you're making your this

757
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,159
is the base of your cheese sauce and you

758
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,159
guys know I just made this pretty

759
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:40,720
recently okay so that's one I just

760
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,039
peeled out peeled back let's see another

761
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,039
one

762
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,480
here yep and I'm just taking the skin

763
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,519
off of course you can leave the skin but

764
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,080
you might have a different color cheese

765
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,320
in the end you you want to have that

766
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,720
authentic looking Cheese look let's

767
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,960
check this pasta cuz I don't want this

768
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,559
biting me in the

769
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,320
butt cuz that pasta will

770
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,799
cook no joke I already pre preheated the

771
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,519
oven at

772
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,639
400 okay so let's take the skins off of

773
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,639
this

774
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,960
one there you go and I might put one

775
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,720
more potato there Karen Spence says is

776
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,720
there a reason to take the skin off

777
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,000
after cooking and not

778
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,440
before well I know when you're taking

779
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,440
the skin off before you can do that you

780
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,240
can totally do it but then you might get

781
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,360
kind of a tougher outside the skin kind

782
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,240
of becomes the the place where the skin

783
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,200
becomes the protective sheath that get

784
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:46,880
takes the heat becomes kind of

785
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,880
like um beat up from it now I got this

786
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
just is all going to be kind of creamed

787
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,519
up easy in the food processor so that's

788
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,240
kind of why I do it if you skin it first

789
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,720
and you cook the potatoes the outside of

790
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,399
the potatoes that you cook cook you get

791
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,559
a little tougher and now this is all

792
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,080
just right there to that that part I'm

793
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,519
going to get one more

794
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,600
potato just in case I got one with a

795
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,600
little piece missing right

796
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,880
here yep so I want to talk about

797
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:19,720
marijuana a little bit more if you guys

798
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,639
are open to it I want to go into an area

799
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,679
where I actually was starting to go into

800
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:28,519
and I kind of got derailed a little bit

801
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,760
so Mar lot of plants get a lot of fungus

802
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,360
they get a white they get a white fungus

803
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,360
is what they

804
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,799
get so they use a lot of

805
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,519
fungicides on marijuana to try to get

806
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,039
rid of this white fungus so the plants

807
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,960
turn white and when they start turning

808
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,360
white they get a white film going all

809
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,159
the way up the trunk of the plant all

810
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,760
the way on the stems it eventually can

811
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,360
get to the buds

812
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,639
too and this is a big problem for

813
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,600
Growers out there and so what they use

814
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,200
is they use a lot of

815
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,720
fungicides on their plants now this is

816
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,120
going to be a decent amount of cheese

817
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,120
here for

818
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,679
sure they get a lot of pests too and see

819
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:18,600
what they do for pest control with

820
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:21,919
marijuana is they use outdated they they

821
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,679
there's auctions out there for outdated

822
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,960
pesticide in aerosol cans so the kind

823
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,279
one you go to the store whatever store

824
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,639
you go to hardware store whatever Big

825
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,320
Box store you go in there and what

826
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,320
happens is

827
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:44,279
that they sell aerosol cans that are Bug

828
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,960
Killers it's like kill spiders kill kill

829
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:52,880
ants ant killer right wasp killer right

830
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,559
let's make sure this doesn't get

831
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,960
overcooked no still got a couple more

832
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,960

833
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
wo all

834
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,320
right I might make two batches of cheese

835
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,679
real

836
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,960

837
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,000

840
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,079
like putting so many carrots in here

841
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,079

I'll show you guys like this right I

844
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,079
don't like putting so many carrots in

845
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,480
here where it's tastes like carrot

846
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,200
cheese if you keep the carrots down a

847
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,440
little bit it won't taste like carrot

848
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,720
cheese it'll taste like cheese it's

849
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,320
crazy when you put all the spices and

850
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,159

things all

863
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,720
right let's go you know how the medical

864
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,720
medium cooking show

865
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,599
rolls sometimes it goes real smooth and

866
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,440
sometimes it could be like a little bit

867
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,440
of a [ __ ] show

868
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,520
right all

869
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,880
right feeling good about that that's the

870
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,520
pasta right there let's get this cheese

871
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,200
cooking right now I don't want this

872
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,200
pasta like drying up in there all

873
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,160
right let's

874
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,880
go all right guys that's my pasta I'm

875
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,599
going to move move this over a little

876
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,359
bit so what Growers like to do is they

877
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:27,280
like to buy outdated auctioned

878
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:30,800
10-year-old aerosol cans of bug killer

879
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,800
and then the workers at weed Farms take

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,079
the can and they just spray it directly

881
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,960
on the plant it's not M it's not like

882
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:41,000
regulated it's not like you know diluted

883
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,000
there's nothing like that going

884
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,200
on

885
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,400
and and so basically what's happening is

886
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,920
people are smoking weed with the blood

887
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,920
of that going

888
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
on

889
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,160

921
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,119

926
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,480
cheese okay spiced up it's looking good

927
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,480
I'm going to move this

928
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,240
over

929
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,480
yeah

930
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,359
boom few sound effects right there let's

931
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,640
just see okay so what you want to do is

932
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,880
this pasta is perfect right now it's not

933
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,640
overcooked I want to show you let's take

934
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,400
a

935
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,400
look if we can

936
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,960
you guys see this past up

937
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,119
close what you want make sure you do is

938
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,119
you don't overcook it if you overcook

939
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,000
it it'll all start sticking together

940
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,720
because you're not adding oil this is a

941
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,160
fat-free dish you're not adding oil

942
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,640
where's all the oil you're not going to

943
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,920
have oil that's the whole point this is

944
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,920
a mac and cheese that doesn't kill your

945
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,440
pancreas I mean how how incredible is

946
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,240

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,599
I'm going to mix this cheese up with it

948
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,599
take a

949
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,119

00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,839
we're not so overloaded that I'm in

951
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,040
trouble in this bow

952
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,880
size actually getting

953
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,440
nervous

954
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,440
yeah let's hope that that's

955
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,280
okay now let's mix this up see what I'm

956
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,040

957
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,079

961
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,200

964
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,480

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,119
heads here but I'm just saying if I know

967
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,880
that people do a lot if you got a bunch

968
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,359
of potheads at your home man and you

969
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,640
make this do you think they'll actually

970
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,640
eat

971
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,880
it or you think they're just going to

972
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,920
order some crazy pizza at some like

973
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,920
really greasy Pizza

974
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,040
chain or most likely somebody's

975
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
urinating in the dough

976
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,440
anyway I don't know about that

977
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,760
all

978
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,200
right just you hear stories you hear

979
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,560
stories over the years okay so I'm just

980
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,560
mixing this up take a look you guys like

981
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,800
it I just want to get that cheese in

982
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
there as good as possible I'm going to

983
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,720
add a little bit more cheese I hope you

984
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,079
guys are okay with this but but there's

985
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,200
still some left and I'm kind of like

986
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,160
partial to this tastes so good check

987
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,160
this

988
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
out

989
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,640
there we

990
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,160
go look at

991
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,480
that I think that actually really does

992
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,400
it now you'll see here it's not o like

993
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,720
there's not I didn't use so many carrots

994
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,920
don't get me wrong you like carrots you

995
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,119
can do more carrots but I didn't use so

996
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,839
many carrots that it's like a you know

997
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,160
like a more of a darker orange cheese I

998
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:54,960
like it like this you can't taste the

999
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,160
carrots I love carrots but you can't

1000
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,160
taste them

1001
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,960
okay so the key is you want to mix it

1002
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,960
pretty good and I'm I'm saying this

1003
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,559
because you don't want an

1004
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,119
unhappy person who's eating in your

1005
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:13,440
house and you don't want somebody that's

1006
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,119
unhappy because they got a little

1007
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,119
section there that doesn't have a lot of

1008
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,800
cheese in it you don't want anybody

1009
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,400
like

1010
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,280
complaining you want everybody happy I

1011
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,440
think that's getting pretty good let's

1012
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,000
let's pan it man let's pan

1013
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,839
it

1014
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
yeah I think we can pan that

1015
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:39,760
baby boom let's take a

1016
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,400

1017
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,079
trying something different and's going

1018
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,680
to bite me in the ass but I put a little

1019
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,400

close-up camera you see

1061
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,640
I'm not putting anything on the

1062
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:06,000
top let me put my aluminum foil on the

1063
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,920
top no I'm not no aluminum foil talking

1064
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
about toxic metals and and and

1065
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,400
everything and PC Rivera says the sauce

1066
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,640
looks so much like cheese only it's not

1067
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,640
and it's healthy not only that here's

1068
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,079
the real screwed up piece about it all

1069
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,640
like here's what's really crazy about it

1070
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,480
right it tastes like cheese it tastes

1071
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,839
like cheese I didn't put salt in this

1072
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,800
one you want to put a little bit of salt

1073
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:33,200
in yours put a little bit of salt in

1074
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,280
yours right and then you got that salty

1075
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,880
cheese

1076
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,599
flavor unlocking Infinity says what

1077
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,960
about marijuana's effect on the

1078
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,280
emotional body because I have seen huge

1079
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,040
benefits not with constant use but

1080
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,359
occasionally with subtle energy Fields

1081
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,640
doesn't seem cut and

1082
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,319
dry so you see what you're saying right

1083
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,160
um look everybody that smokes weed that

1084
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,280
loves to smoke weed they'll they'll

1085
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,599
they'll say the same thing they're not

1086
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,440
going to say it's bad like it's it's

1087
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:04,200
hurting them I mean there should if they

1088
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,400
try weed and they like weed and it feels

1089
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,040
good and they like to do that they're

1090
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,200
going to continue to do that ask them

1091
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,319
ask them how it's working for them

1092
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,240
they'll tell you how great it's working

1093
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,520
for them like I said I told this story

1094
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,119
over time and I hope my friend doesn't

1095
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,359
kill me

1096
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,319
but you know my friend is still sitting

1097
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:25,160
on his couch smoking weed

1098
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:27,720
and he's he's up there in age and uh his

1099
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,720
wife left

1100
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,960
left them years ago and she couldn't

1101
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,440
take it anymore right great guy

1102
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,000
incredible guy

1103
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,720
but you know she first got into the

1104
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,960
relationship and she was smoking weed

1105
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,160
with him and they were both weed smokers

1106
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,839
and they were happy and they were

1107
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,760
smoking and then eventually she was like

1108
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,640
I can't do this anymore no matter how it

1109
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,760
makes me feel or how I can't do this

1110
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,640
anymore and she felt like it was time

1111
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,520
for her to um leave the weed smoking

1112
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,760
world and so so when she did that he was

1113
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,520
really upset and he didn't want to

1114
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,119
change for her so he didn't want to

1115
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,040
change he was like no I'm not going to

1116
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,720
change for you we've been married all

1117
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,559
these years and I don't want to change

1118
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,359
for you and so that's what he told her

1119
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,200
over and over again for years she quit

1120
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:15,359
smoking weed and then and then she had

1121
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,200
to smell it every day in the house and

1122
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,880
she had to smell it in the living room

1123
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,319
and she really kind of got to a place

1124
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,800
where she was like just one morning he

1125
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,359
woke

1126
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,880
up and there was a in the kitchen and it

1127
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,640
said I have to leave I'm gone and he was

1128
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,440
like what and instead of him pulling his

1129
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,920
crap together and like and really

1130
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,079
working it out with her and be like all

1131
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,480
right I'll back down on my weed smoking

1132
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,880
I'll try to like I'll try to you know do

1133
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,240
I'll try to work with you on this

1134
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,720
instead of that it just he just didn't

1135
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,400
didn't pursue and it's really sad treia

1136
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,280
said that's what broke up my last

1137
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,839
relationship on YouTube right there um

1138
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,680
this is just it it happens it happens

1139
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,599
really difficult for a lot of people and

1140
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,160
my ex became addicted it was constant

1141
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,839
every day so much so he changed his

1142
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,720
attitude his priorities I could not

1143
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:13,040
stand it I could not stand it exactly

1144
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,920
and so I've seen this happen to a friend

1145
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,400
and you know friend's a good guy and

1146
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,359
everything but that's what he does it's

1147
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,119
just it happens Jor

1148
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,000
said weed gave me a panic attack never

1149
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,119
worked for my symptoms a lot of people

1150
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,400
say this so many people there's two

1151
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,599
kinds of people in the world there's

1152
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,680
people that smoke

1153
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,760
weed and there's people that tried weed

1154
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,760
and it gave them panic

1155
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,520
attacks that's a big one right there so

1156
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,799
many people that tried weed and it gave

1157
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,040
them panic attacks it made them not feel

1158
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,559
good in so many ways it's like either

1159
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,319
weed two kind of people in the world

1160
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,960
people that like weed people that

1161
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:51,040
don't right that's pretty much what it

1162
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,040
is in the end if you really kind of

1163
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,440
break it down as far as weed goes but by

1164
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,599
no means is this like

1165
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,640
you know bashing weed smokers or

1166
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,880
anything like that it would

1167
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,799
never ever do that

1168
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,240
because you know I know how life works

1169
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,599
it's called A Hard freaking world we

1170
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,119
live in and there's a reason why someone

1171
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,760
started smoking it it's a reason why it

1172
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,559
took on a habit it's a reason why it

1173
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,920
took on addiction it's a reason why

1174
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,000
they're trapped in it there's a reason

1175
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,119
why they're doing it and there's a

1176
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,160
reason why there are thousands and

1177
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,680
thousands and thousands of people

1178
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,240
homeless on

1179
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,680
drugs everywhere right now all over the

1180
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,200
streets or wherever and it's it's crazy

1181
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,839
like and I'm not saying we did that

1182
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,319
that's not at all what I'm saying I'm

1183
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:41,200
not ignorant like that or I'm not like

1184
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:45,200
naive or anything like that that's not

1185
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,400
how it works I'm just saying though that

1186
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,880
it it's gotten a lot of people and

1187
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,640
there's people that say I can control it

1188
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,880
I can control it I can control it like I

1189
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,720
got it under control I do just parties

1190
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,000
weekends and all that I respect that

1191
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,640
whatever

1192
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,440
and I'm not against anybody who's even

1193
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,040
doing it but here's what I always say

1194
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,400
whatever Vice you have or whatever

1195
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,760
you're using that you feel is helping

1196
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,400
you medically or however it is and I'm

1197
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,400
not not dissing the whole medical

1198
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,200
marijuana thing people you use it for

1199
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,400
pain relief no way am I dissing that at

1200
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,000
all like I said there's so many people

1201
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,079
that use it for so many reasons it's

1202
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,160
really hard it's hard and there

1203
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,480
situations are really difficult I'm just

1204
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,160
saying that you might be somebody that's

1205
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,240
like whoo I didn't know about this and

1206
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,760
maybe I can do this and maybe there is

1207
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,960
some maybe I can get the metals out of

1208
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,079
my brain instead so I don't need weed

1209
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,119
people say that they test weed for toxic

1210
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,640
heavy metals before it's sold people say

1211
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:46,000
that all the time uh

1212
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,640
sure sure sure sure and people saying

1213
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,160
there's organic weed and it's free of

1214
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,799
toxic heavy metals just like tat two ink

1215
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,880
is free of toxic heavy metals heard that

1216
00:51:52,799 --> 00:52:01,440
over and over again and my tattoo to

1217
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,960
Salon we use ink that is metal free

1218
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,480
heard that over and over again over

1219
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,079
again but that's not true that's not

1220
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,319
reality that's not how it works okay

1221
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,520
keep that in mind right there it's very

1222
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,440
important to know tattoo ink is loaded

1223
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,880
with metals because that's how you get

1224
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,040
the pop remember how I always told you

1225
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,040
guys I tell you guys all the time that's

1226
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,640
mm info by the way out there once again

1227
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,680
now they're talking about it like wait a

1228
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,559
minute did you know vegan ink and has

1229
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,000
Metals in it you know it came from mm

1230
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:34,000
info but in medical medum books and

1231
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,880
everything but the point is is that yeah

1232
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,599
sure you know my organic weed you know

1233
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,839
grower you know whatever there's nothing

1234
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:48,359
toxic in here it's all clean uh-uh uh-uh

1235
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:51,119
no way no way in fact it's the opposite

1236
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:53,440
in fact they're testing weed now in fact

1237
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,000
they're actually finding its high in

1238
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,200
metals in fact it's going to probably

1239
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,200
change the way weed growing works out

1240
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,720
there because people are on to it now

1241
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,559
because of mm info but they're on to it

1242
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,119
and so it's going to change as time goes

1243
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:10,760
on and like I said before the people who

1244
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,440
actually are farming and using it are

1245
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,480
still not going to stop their practices

1246
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,400
their practices are like grow the

1247
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,000
biggest

1248
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,599
bud makeshift your fertilizer use your

1249
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,079
aerosol canned bug spray that's the

1250
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,000
rules that's how it works people always

1251
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,440
ask if they're

1252
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,720
urinating and cucumbers and other

1253
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,640
produce no they're not they're not using

1254
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,599
they're not using urine in the process

1255
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,680
of organic farming I'm talking about

1256
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,839
people use urine for their own backyard

1257
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,520
growing their own little farm that

1258
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,720
they're doing their own garden people

1259
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,559
use their own urine they store the urine

1260
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,359
they mix it with water they find a ratio

1261
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,000
some even test it a little bit test

1262
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,119
their own urine to try to find ratios

1263
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,720
for nitrogen that's really difficult

1264
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,200
really that's not really what they do

1265
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,359
but some people are trying to do that

1266
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,040
really what happens is they're just

1267
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,520
mixing urine with water and they're just

1268
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,839
trying to find the right batch and then

1269
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,200
they go and spread it on their

1270
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,720
Garden but with organic farming and the

1271
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,680
organic produce and everything like that

1272
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:14,040
you're not getting human urine as your

1273
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,079
fertilizer for that so it doesn't work

1274
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,000
like that I'm going to make a salad

1275
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,240
circuit and working on that um if the

1276
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,200
worker pees once in a while on produce

1277
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,960
field that's much different than what

1278
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,000
we're talking about here so if you got

1279
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,079
an organic farm and worker runs off to

1280
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,520
the edge of the field and pees somewhere

1281
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,040
that that's not what we're talking about

1282
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,160
here so if you're if you just got on

1283
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,160
here watch this whole thing for the

1284
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,960
beginning

1285
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,280
yep let's start making a salad we're

1286
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,520
still talking about weed and marijuana

1287
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,880
something else is going to come to mind

1288
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,319
too I did want to finish those thoughts

1289
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,520
though about like spraying down the

1290
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,359
plants they spray them down with the

1291
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,559
aerosol cans as I was saying before but

1292
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:01,079
you have to know that um there isn't

1293
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,760
it's not like there's all these rules

1294
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,000
big rules and regulations with weed

1295
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,119
growing even states that are completely

1296
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,799
open to it it's not like somebody's

1297
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,720
coming in inspectors are coming in every

1298
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,359
minute and they're like you can't use

1299
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,960
this you can't use that you can't do

1300
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,280
this you can't do that they they don't

1301
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:21,680
have that going on yet it's pretty wild

1302
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:25,079
west and another thing too is the fields

1303
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:28,160
the very few Growers that are at

1304
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:31,920
adhering to anything that doesn't

1305
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:35,520
constitute the rest of the 95 97% of all

1306
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,520
the other Growers including for sure all

1307
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,319
the other growers in different countries

1308
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,079
so that's a whole another level too of

1309
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:44,559
understanding there no regulations to

1310
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,319
anything the stuff is high in toxic

1311
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:51,039
stuff stuff is high in plastic stuff is

1312
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:52,160
high in metals it's high in it's high in

1313
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,319
actually

1314
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,839
everything um that you don't want

1315
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:58,480
dioxins is a whole another one all on

1316
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:00,440
its own let's let's start making a salad

1317
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,880
we'll cover some

1318
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,039
more why does weed give so many people

1319
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,119
panic attacks and anxiety it's toxic to

1320
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,720
the brain I talk about like a lot of the

1321
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:11,319
brain obviously in the brains saer books

1322
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,039
there's a Brain saer book right there

1323
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:15,039
here's the brain saver protocols right

1324
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,400
here I'm going to do a whole show on

1325
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,720
like weed what it does to the brain and

1408
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,000
that I'm not going to put them in there

beautiful tomatoes like

1416
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,119
this I would say one of the biggest

1417
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,720
reasons

1418
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,960
why why weed is so toxic with Metals one

1419
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,799
of the biggest reasons is probably the

1420
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,799
canned bug

1421
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,039

cool no yeah no all right let's get a

1455
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,319
few more tomatoes on here you want

1456
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:37,920
tomatoes in your Sal so when you mix it

1457
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:39,079
up you want it to look nice and tomatoey

1458
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,599
I'm just going to get a couple of these

1459
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:43,119
pieces in here all right let's get it

1460
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,119
cucumber

1461
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,920
skinned all right and let's

1462
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:54,440
get some of this tomato juice off of

1463
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,359
here you want to you want to actually

1464
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,319
avoid cutting yourself so easily make

1465
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:01,680
sure your board is dry all that tomato

1466
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:05,039
juice makes things slippery and when

1467
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,400
things get slippery your whatever slides

1468
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,640
out from underneath you and then you're

1469
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,760
in

1470
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:12,039
trouble all right I take the skin off

1471
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,400
you see that skin right there you know

1472
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:16,119
what's on that skin I don't care if it's

1473
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,559
organic I don't care if it's the most

1474
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,039
organic unless it's in your backyard

1475
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,839
unless you raise it yourself unless you

1476
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,359
Gro yourself even if it's organic farm

1477
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,440
like organic farm cucumbers they're

1478
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:29,599
sprayed with wax and MSG and nicotine

1479
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,680
and caffeine all on the outside of the

1480
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,839
um of the Cucumbers but if you and I'm

1481
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:39,200
getting all that off that's why I take

1482
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:39,200
the green off of the Cucumber you

1483
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,680
guys would the world change if everybody

1484
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,200
who smoked weed just smoked cucumbers

1485
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,760
would that change

1486
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,000
anything dry dehydrated cucumbers and

1487
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,559
they just smoke

1488
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,079
that now it's not just cucumber they do

1489
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,039
that but cucumber's a big one they do

1490
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:59,359
that with it's but that's not just

1491
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,119
cucumber but cucumber's a big one right

1492
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:04,839
there so I got most of that off feeling

1493
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,839
pretty good about

1494
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,720
that all

1495
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,359
right but I'm just talking about organic

1496
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,720
produce in general you know how it's

1497
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:17,640
organic produce is sprayed with waxes

1498
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,960
and all that filming stuff conventional

1499
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,680
produce too but but we still we need our

1500
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,520
organic produce we need our produce

1501
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,760
whether it's conventional we need to eat

1502
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,960
are you know herbs and wild foods and

1503
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,599
fruits and vegetables and everything

1504
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,720
else and leafy greens we have to eat

1505
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,319
those so I'm just saying that one of the

1506
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,240
things you do is with cucumbers unless

1507
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:37,079
you grow them in your own backyard you

1508
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,480
just want to peel the skin off if you

1509
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:39,799
don't peel the skin off you eat it that

1510
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,839
way so be it it's not the end of the

1511
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:43,119
world I'm just saying that you do want

1512
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:45,720
to do that now I'm going to cut this in

1513
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:49,200
half and make like half cucumber

1514
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:50,920
slices from what the recipe kind of

1515
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:54,200
calls for

1516
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,599
here all right so I'm going to do is I'm

1517
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,640
going to knock some of these down like

1518
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,520
this you don't want them too thick oh

1519
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,559
wait you might want them thick you can

1520
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,160
put them on your salad any way you like

1521
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,799
I'm putting them a little bit thinner so

1522
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,240
that you're not like stuck eating a huge

1523
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:10,319
piece of cucumber while you're trying to

1524
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,319
enjoy your salad so

1525
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,960
the let's check that mac and

1526
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,440
cheese dang that mac and cheese is just

1527
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:26,079
about done that ain't no joke that stuff

1528
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,079
is just about done

1529
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:31,680
just about

1530
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,720
done another thing too you know when

1531
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,880
they use those aerosol bug spray cans

1532
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,920
for all the crops for all the marijuana

1533
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,240
crops you know as the workers are doing

1534
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,200
it the workers are breathing it in

1535
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,839
they're not hating suiting themselves

1536
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,039
and they don't they're not wearing masks

1537
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:45,039
they're just breathing it all in and

1538
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:47,880
then they

1539
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,400
urinate afterwards with all that bug

1540
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,079
spray in their bloodstream and they

1541
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,520
create urine that's even higher in toxic

1542
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:53,760
heavy metals and all kinds of different

1543
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,400
pesticides and they use that as

1544
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,359
fertilizer wizer it's just it's like a

1545
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,160
vicious cycle it just goes on and it

1546
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:01,160
goes on and goes on how crazy is

1547
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:07,400
that and in the end I know nobody really

1548
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:09,599
