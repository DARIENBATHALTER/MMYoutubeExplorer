[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 47.12] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 50.08] Anthony William. This is episode two of
[47.12 - 52.24] the geoengineering chemtrail series. In
[50.08 - 54.64] this episode, we're going deeper into
[52.24 - 58.76] the sabotage, and we're going to start
[54.64 - 61.64] with the weaponized decoy called the
[58.76 - 64.08] contrail. The contrail, the ultimate
[61.64 - 67.20] psychout. It's not a chemtrail you're
[64.08 - 70.24] seeing up there, sir. It's a contrail.
[67.20 - 72.80] Reminds me of the old bait and switch.
[70.24 - 74.88] Remember the old days? That's not a UFO
[72.80 - 77.20] that landed in your yard, Mr. Hansen.
[74.88 - 79.36] That was a weather balloon. And now
[77.20 - 83.68] these days, we're in a time everybody
[79.36 - 86.56] knows aliens exist. Everybody, or almost
[83.68 - 90.36] everybody believes they exist. They
[86.56 - 94.08] believe there's spacecrafts, spaceships,
[90.36 - 97.04] UFOs, unidentified objects flying in the
[94.08 - 100.96] sky, in the atmosphere, life on other
[97.04 - 104.24] planets. nowadays. Too much proof, too
[100.96 - 107.36] many videos, too many people with too
[104.24 - 110.16] many sightings, even the government
[107.36 - 112.24] talking about it as being actually real.
[110.16 - 115.96] And worldwide, there's an understanding
[112.24 - 119.36] that alien life exists beyond our solar
[115.96 - 123.28] system. But in the ' 50s, '60s, '7s,
[119.36 - 125.84] 80s, '90s, no way. It didn't exist. It
[123.28 - 128.48] was weather balloons. It was the fog.
[125.84 - 130.92] That's what it was. or something else.
[128.48 - 134.16] But now we know better. We have so much
[130.92 - 136.24] proof. It's obvious. But what about the
[134.16 - 137.64] chemtrails? What about geoengineering
[136.24 - 140.24] and weather
[137.64 - 142.16] modification? Why is that such a
[140.24 - 144.76] mystery? Why are chemtrails such a
[142.16 - 148.08] mystery? Why does it seem like such a
[144.76 - 151.12] conspiracy theory? And why is there so
[148.08 - 153.92] much censorship around chemtrails? And
[151.12 - 155.92] how come no one comes clean? They're
[153.92 - 158.64] dumping this stuff on everybody every
[155.92 - 160.96] single day. Planes are releasing toxic
[158.64 - 163.36] chemicals on people every day, every
[160.96 - 165.44] hour, every minute. And if someone says
[163.36 - 167.60] something, it's make believe. Just like
[165.44 - 169.12] the old weather balloon, they're told
[167.60 - 171.12] it's not true. They're told they're
[169.12 - 172.88] seeing things. There's no toxic
[171.12 - 176.16] chemicals being dropped on everybody
[172.88 - 177.68] from planes. That's absurd. In this
[176.16 - 181.20] episode, we're going to explore the
[177.68 - 182.96] contrail. The con. The ultimate con.
[181.20 - 187.20] Fasten your seat belts and get ready for
[182.96 - 187.20] this one. We're taking another plane
[187.56 - 193.28] flight. Mister, what's your name? Um,
[190.72 - 196.00] yeah. Um, John Applebee. Okay, Mr.
[193.28 - 199.44] Applebee, explain what you saw. Um, I
[196.00 - 202.32] saw a spaceship flying over our farm.
[199.44 - 205.08] And then my son saw a little gray man
[202.32 - 209.08] that ran across the yard and into the
[205.08 - 211.92] cornfield. And then the spacecraft, the
[209.08 - 214.64] spaceship did weaved a whole bunch of
[211.92 - 218.08] stuff in the corn field and all the corn
[214.64 - 220.72] is all wrapped together like in a knot
[218.08 - 223.52] and then the spacecraft just flew off
[220.72 - 225.76] into the sky and disappeared. U Mr.
[223.52 - 228.08] Applebee, there are lots of reports of
[225.76 - 230.88] weather balloons in this area and some
[228.08 - 233.52] thick fog. We're putting on record that
[230.88 - 236.16] this was a weather balloon and uh I just
[233.52 - 238.88] need you to sign the statement. Uh, but
[236.16 - 241.04] wait a minute. My son saw Mr. Applebee,
[238.88 - 243.48] no disrespect to your son, but he's 9
[241.04 - 247.20] years old and children have
[243.48 - 250.24] imaginations. But I saw the spaceship
[247.20 - 254.08] and it was over the house and it made a
[250.24 - 256.56] lot of noise. Mr. Applebee, John, you
[254.08 - 259.20] saw a weather balloon. You understand
[256.56 - 261.76] this now, do you? You have your hand on
[259.20 - 264.08] my shoulder. Can you just take your hand
[261.76 - 267.44] off my shoulder? If you don't understand
[264.08 - 269.12] this and what you saw a weather balloon,
[267.44 - 271.60] we're going to have to question you and
[269.12 - 275.12] your family further. Do you understand
[271.60 - 278.72] this? Uh, I suppose you're right. I
[275.12 - 281.20] think I did see a weather balloon. Um,
[278.72 - 283.68] and uh, it was a big weather balloon and
[281.20 - 287.28] uh, the fog is kind of thick tonight.
[283.68 - 289.60] And I I appreciate um, you guys coming
[287.28 - 291.92] out here and uh, uh, let me just sign
[289.60 - 295.76] that document right here. I see. Uh,
[291.92 - 297.50] John um Applebee, have a good night, Mr.
[295.76 - 314.05] Applebee.
[297.50 - 314.05] [Music]
[316.80 - 321.12] Many times over the years, over the
[318.64 - 324.32] decades, the 40s, the '50s, the ' 60s,
[321.12 - 327.64] '7s, '8s, '9s, it was just like that.
[324.32 - 330.48] Alien abductions, UFO sightings, alien
[327.64 - 333.16] sightings, all swept under the carpet.
[330.48 - 336.20] All tucked away, hidden away. classified
[333.16 - 339.76] reports, redacted documents, hidden
[336.20 - 342.32] documents, missing footage of sightings,
[339.76 - 344.40] a 100red years of aliens aren't real,
[342.32 - 346.32] UFO sightings aren't real. There must
[344.40 - 349.20] have been some sand in your eyes. You
[346.32 - 350.88] must be tired. Are you on drugs?
[349.20 - 352.56] Meanwhile, we've come a long way and
[350.88 - 354.64] it's obvious now. And so much
[352.56 - 356.80] information is released and so much
[354.64 - 358.96] footage is taken because everybody's got
[356.80 - 363.04] a camera in their hands. The world is
[358.96 - 366.56] different. It's accepted. aliens, UFOs,
[363.04 - 369.44] life from other planets, flying saucers
[366.56 - 371.44] is accepted. Are there some people that
[369.44 - 373.68] still believe there's no such thing? Of
[371.44 - 376.00] course there is, and there may always be
[373.68 - 378.96] that. But the world, for the most part,
[376.00 - 382.40] has accepted life from other planets,
[378.96 - 384.84] sightings, UFOs. There recently are even
[382.40 - 388.88] police officers coming to people's
[384.84 - 390.96] residences that saw a UFO land, aliens
[388.88 - 393.76] running through their backyards, and the
[390.96 - 396.24] police were actually afraid to go and
[393.76 - 399.12] seek out those aliens because they knew
[396.24 - 402.28] it was real and it was frightening. But
[399.12 - 404.72] we're not there yet with the
[402.28 - 407.04] chemtrails. We're not there yet even
[404.72 - 408.96] with geoengineering. That's a whole
[407.04 - 411.60] mystery. People don't even know what
[408.96 - 413.60] geoengineering is or have a clue about
[411.60 - 415.92] weather modification and what that
[413.60 - 418.24] means. And the powers that be that run
[415.92 - 420.56] this planet, that actually really run
[418.24 - 422.24] this planet, the evildoers that have
[420.56 - 425.20] caused so much harm throughout the
[422.24 - 428.00] decades and the centuries, don't want
[425.20 - 430.88] anyone to know about the chemtrails.
[428.00 - 433.52] They want people to believe in contrails
[430.88 - 436.32] that chemtrails don't exist at all. They
[433.52 - 439.20] want people to believe that it is an
[436.32 - 441.84] actual conspiracy theory, a ridiculous
[439.20 - 444.44] thing. Dangerous toxic chemicals have
[441.84 - 447.60] been being dumped on everybody since the
[444.44 - 450.48] 1960s. Planes filled up with tanks
[447.60 - 453.04] inside of them. No passengers on there,
[450.48 - 456.00] just a couple of pilots. and dangerous
[453.04 - 458.64] and deadly toxic chemicals, toxic waste
[456.00 - 461.52] being released out of these jet planes
[458.64 - 464.72] into the atmosphere, dumped on us day in
[461.52 - 467.36] and day out since the 1960s all the way
[464.72 - 469.44] till now every day and you can see it up
[467.36 - 471.20] in the sky. All you have to do is look
[469.44 - 474.08] and you see the white streaks going
[471.20 - 477.20] across the sky. But even though we see
[474.08 - 479.36] it every day all around the globe, we're
[477.20 - 482.00] told it's not real and what we're seeing
[479.36 - 483.96] is not real and it's not actual reality.
[482.00 - 486.44] It's not the truth. That these are
[483.96 - 490.00] chemtrails. We're told these are
[486.44 - 491.84] contrails. Contrails. The ultimate con.
[490.00 - 493.76] World governments, world authorities
[491.84 - 496.48] don't want to fess up. They don't want
[493.76 - 498.40] to truly admit what it really is. And
[496.48 - 500.56] there's still a lot of push back over
[498.40 - 503.40] the chemtrail thing. There's a lot of
[500.56 - 506.68] censorship over it. Even weaponized
[503.40 - 509.80] fakeipedia, Wikipedia, the ultimate
[506.68 - 512.72] fakeipedia, puts out statements about
[509.80 - 515.36] contrails anytime anything's mentioned
[512.72 - 518.08] about chemtrails out there. Then why is
[515.36 - 521.12] everybody trying to hide it? Why is
[518.08 - 524.48] Fikipedia, Wikipedia trying to hide it?
[521.12 - 526.96] Why is authorities around the planet
[524.48 - 530.64] trying to hide it as if it's not there
[526.96 - 534.88] when planes are flying every day over
[530.64 - 537.80] everyone dumping highly toxic chemicals
[534.88 - 540.48] on everybody? And here we are
[537.80 - 543.60] 2025 and there's no transparency with
[540.48 - 545.60] this. 2025, people are out there having
[543.60 - 548.16] a picnic. They're grilling on their
[545.60 - 550.48] grills. They're outside taking walks
[548.16 - 552.20] during Easter. They're taking jo.
[550.48 - 554.96] They're running on the streets. They're
[552.20 - 556.84] exercising. They're in the parks. All
[554.96 - 559.28] the kids are in school and on the
[556.84 - 561.76] playgrounds. And in the sky above
[559.28 - 564.72] everybody are these streaks, these white
[561.76 - 567.60] streaks floating everywhere. Dangerous
[564.72 - 570.72] chemicals released out of planes.
[567.60 - 572.56] Meanwhile, it's all a dirty secret. And
[570.72 - 575.96] these chemicals being released every
[572.56 - 578.56] single day are cocktails. Highly toxic
[575.96 - 581.12] cocktails. And the contents of these
[578.56 - 584.48] cocktails we're going to talk about in
[581.12 - 587.80] detail in upcoming episodes. But if you
[584.48 - 591.64] like spoilers, mercury, lead, aluminum,
[587.80 - 595.36] copper, petroleum byproducts, acids,
[591.64 - 598.28] barerium, solvents, herbicides, mosquito
[595.36 - 601.36] killers, thousands of different kinds of
[598.28 - 604.00] byproducts from worldwide industrial
[601.36 - 606.24] chemical industries, chemicals from old
[604.00 - 608.56] storage bins from World War I, chemicals
[606.24 - 611.52] from storage bins from World War II,
[608.56 - 613.32] Agent Orange, DDT, and these are just
[611.52 - 615.84] the chemtrails. We're not talking about
[613.32 - 618.64] geoengineering chemtrails. It's a little
[615.84 - 622.16] bit different. Lots and lots of metal
[618.64 - 624.72] and custom factory-made combinations to
[622.16 - 628.00] block the sun to manipulate the rain to
[624.72 - 629.00] create floods and different unique
[628.00 - 632.16] weather
[629.00 - 635.24] combinations, deflectors and reflectors
[632.16 - 638.00] to actually start up tornadoes and
[635.24 - 640.24] hurricanes. Geoengineering is a fancy
[638.00 - 642.32] word which really means we're going to
[640.24 - 645.20] steal your sunlight. We're going to try
[642.32 - 647.44] to create a tornado or hurricane. We're
[645.20 - 648.96] going to try to create a flash flood.
[647.44 - 651.44] We're going to dump a bunch of metal
[648.96 - 653.60] particles in the sky. We're going to try
[651.44 - 656.72] to change the electrical currents of
[653.60 - 659.84] mother nature and storms and rain and
[656.72 - 661.60] clouds. All while guaranteeing somebody
[659.84 - 663.92] with asthma is going to have a rough
[661.60 - 666.56] day. Because these evildoers behind
[663.92 - 669.52] geoengineering and weather modification
[666.56 - 672.16] and these evildoers behind chemtrails
[669.52 - 674.72] and the chemtrail programs don't care
[672.16 - 677.04] who gets sick. They don't care who
[674.72 - 679.12] breathes in what. They don't care what's
[677.04 - 681.60] dumped on everybody's heads. They don't
[679.12 - 684.64] care what's dumped on everybody's food,
[681.60 - 687.12] the gardens, the farm fields, the
[684.64 - 689.76] produce that grows. And they don't care
[687.12 - 691.76] about little children with asthmatic
[689.76 - 693.84] conditions and all kinds of different
[691.76 - 695.68] lung problems. And they don't care about
[693.84 - 697.44] the chronically ill. They don't care
[695.68 - 699.52] about people with different kinds of
[697.44 - 701.84] symptoms and conditions that are hyper
[699.52 - 704.48] sensitive. And they don't care about the
[701.84 - 706.72] stuff that they release in the sky
[704.48 - 709.68] creating Alzheimer's and dementia
[706.72 - 712.24] contributing to it. What they care about
[709.68 - 714.16] they the evildoers, the people that run
[712.24 - 717.60] this planet way above public
[714.16 - 719.40] authorities. What they do care about is
[717.60 - 722.16] if you know it's a
[719.40 - 724.32] chemtrail is that you know the truth
[722.16 - 727.04] that they're dumping stuff on you. They
[724.32 - 728.96] don't want the chemtrails to stop. They
[727.04 - 730.72] don't want the classified programs to
[728.96 - 733.68] stop. They don't want the millions of
[730.72 - 736.08] planes worldwide to stop flying. They
[733.68 - 738.72] want to keep on dumping what they want
[736.08 - 742.48] onto people. and they want everybody to
[738.72 - 745.08] believe the ultimate con that it is a
[742.48 - 748.48] contrail that they're seeing, not a
[745.08 - 751.20] chemtrail. So, let's get into contrails.
[748.48 - 754.32] What is a contrail anyway? A contrail is
[751.20 - 759.04] moisture. Moisture in the engines. And
[754.32 - 762.56] as the plane rises, starts to head up,
[759.04 - 765.68] goes up to higher altitudes, the weather
[762.56 - 768.56] changes. the cold air against the
[765.68 - 771.20] engines, the hot engines and the
[768.56 - 773.68] moisture involved. Just like on a really
[771.20 - 776.88] cold day, you start your truck or you
[773.68 - 779.92] start your car and you see the exhaust
[776.88 - 781.92] and you see all that white fume and
[779.92 - 784.80] smoke come out the back of the exhaust
[781.92 - 787.88] pipes until it disappears and there's
[784.80 - 790.40] nothing there. An exhaust trail, a
[787.88 - 792.72] conra. And when the jet's going up, it's
[790.40 - 795.12] really cold up there in the atmosphere.
[792.72 - 797.52] And the hot engines and the moisture
[795.12 - 800.80] involved in the engines and the cool
[797.52 - 803.64] air, the icy cool air. As the plane
[800.80 - 806.40] climbs to a higher altitude, you get a
[803.64 - 809.12] contrail. But here's the key. The
[806.40 - 812.00] contrail can only last so long, and it
[809.12 - 815.44] can only be so long. It can't be miles
[812.00 - 818.40] and miles long. A contrail can only be
[815.44 - 821.84] 100 feet or a couple hundred feet long
[818.40 - 824.96] or 100 yards at best. And in the sky, a
[821.84 - 827.04] contrail is really short, very short. So
[824.96 - 828.96] you see the jet plane and you see the
[827.04 - 831.40] contrail. But keep in mind, it's when
[828.96 - 835.04] the jet plane is climbing high,
[831.40 - 837.20] ascending, not descending. A jet plane
[835.04 - 840.00] when descending cannot create a
[837.20 - 842.08] contrail. A plane when it's ascending
[840.00 - 844.32] can create a contrail, but only when
[842.08 - 846.80] it's ascending, going up, not when it's
[844.32 - 850.40] been up already and it's flying. So when
[846.80 - 853.04] a plane is 20,000 ft in the sky and
[850.40 - 855.68] flying, it cannot create a contrail
[853.04 - 857.44] anymore. It can't. It can only create a
[855.68 - 860.40] contrail when it's heading up to that
[857.44 - 863.64] 20,000 ft and then it stops. And that
[860.40 - 866.72] contrail is short. Once again, extremely
[863.64 - 869.48] short. So, a contrail can only last so
[866.72 - 871.92] long because there's only so much
[869.48 - 874.24] condensation. Condensation burns away
[871.92 - 878.88] really quick. It can't just leave a
[874.24 - 882.40] streak in the sky 5 m long or 10 m long
[878.88 - 885.12] or 20 m long. But the geoengineering
[882.40 - 887.56] industry and the chemtrail industry
[885.12 - 890.60] wants you to believe that it's
[887.56 - 894.28] contrails, not chemtrails, not deadly
[890.60 - 897.56] chemicals, not metals. instead just
[894.28 - 899.68] condensation water that becomes ice
[897.56 - 902.52] particles. And they want you to believe
[899.68 - 905.92] that these ice particles can last for
[902.52 - 908.64] miles, can span miles, can be a white
[905.92 - 912.48] streak in the sky that can go 20, 40
[908.64 - 915.72] miles long, but contrails can't. And
[912.48 - 918.32] that condensation that turns into ice
[915.72 - 921.92] crystals doesn't really turn into ice
[918.32 - 924.48] crystals. It vaporizes just like out of
[921.92 - 927.12] your exhaust pipe in your car on a
[924.48 - 930.40] really cold day. Ice isn't shooting out
[927.12 - 932.32] of your exhaust pipe. And that steam,
[930.40 - 934.80] that condensation that's coming out of
[932.32 - 937.68] your exhaust pipe isn't turning into ice
[934.80 - 940.56] particles and floating in the street. As
[937.68 - 943.04] a car goes by and it's 10 below zero,
[940.56 - 945.36] you're not walking across the street and
[943.04 - 949.04] hitting ice particles. And as the
[945.36 - 951.36] exhaust steam passes by or floats out of
[949.04 - 954.16] the exhaust pipes and floats into the
[951.36 - 956.80] air or the wind takes it, that's not a
[954.16 - 959.04] stream of straight ice particles. Just
[956.80 - 961.36] as you breathe out of your mouth and you
[959.04 - 965.20] see your breath, you see it float in the
[961.36 - 968.24] air on a really freezing cold day, 20
[965.20 - 970.48] below zero, you're breathing. You're
[968.24 - 973.12] seeing your breath leave your mouth and
[970.48 - 977.04] you're seeing moisture come out of your
[973.12 - 979.96] lungs. moisture. As this water vapor
[977.04 - 983.76] leaves your lungs, it's like a liquid
[979.96 - 985.96] gas. Gas formed out of water. And on a
[983.76 - 988.80] really cold day, you won't see
[985.96 - 991.84] snowflakes come out of your lungs. You
[988.80 - 994.88] won't see snowflakes form and come out
[991.84 - 997.28] of your mouth. You won't see large ice
[994.88 - 1000.48] crystals come out of your mouth and
[997.28 - 1003.60] float in the air. And up in the sky in
[1000.48 - 1005.44] those planes, the exhaust, it's
[1003.60 - 1007.20] different than our lungs and it's
[1005.44 - 1009.84] different than our physical bodies and
[1007.20 - 1012.96] our breath. But there are similarities
[1009.84 - 1015.60] when it comes down to moisture, hot
[1012.96 - 1018.80] moisture, and when it's hitting cold.
[1015.60 - 1022.88] When moisture in a hot engine that runs
[1018.80 - 1025.76] through hot exhaust leaves and gets into
[1022.88 - 1028.56] the air and becomes airborne does not
[1025.76 - 1031.92] turn into snow crystals, does not turn
[1028.56 - 1035.76] into snow, does not turn into ice.
[1031.92 - 1037.24] Instead, that liquid gas is a vapor. And
[1035.76 - 1040.72] that vapor
[1037.24 - 1044.32] vaporizes because that water wasn't a
[1040.72 - 1046.64] mist. That condensation wasn't a mist.
[1044.32 - 1049.52] And even at some point where there was
[1046.64 - 1051.36] enough condensation or an extreme amount
[1049.52 - 1054.16] of condensation coming out of those
[1051.36 - 1056.48] exhaust pipes, it would be short-lived.
[1054.16 - 1059.00] Coming out of those jet engines, it
[1056.48 - 1062.60] would be short-lived. As short as
[1059.00 - 1066.16] seconds, as short as 10 to 15 to 20
[1062.60 - 1069.20] seconds, not enough to make a chemtrail.
[1066.16 - 1071.76] Instead, just a small contrail. Now,
[1069.20 - 1073.68] there is a difference between chemtrails
[1071.76 - 1076.40] and geoengineering.
[1073.68 - 1078.80] weather modification trails and they are
[1076.40 - 1081.36] two different organizations that share
[1078.80 - 1083.44] the skies. One is using dangerous
[1081.36 - 1086.32] chemicals and dangerous metals to
[1083.44 - 1089.00] manipulate weather and weather patterns.
[1086.32 - 1093.20] Another is just dumping dangerous
[1089.00 - 1096.36] chemicals cocktails including fungus,
[1093.20 - 1098.28] different forms of fungi onto the public
[1096.36 - 1101.12] purposely. When it comes down to
[1098.28 - 1104.08] contrails, in the end they have nothing
[1101.12 - 1108.00] to do with any of this. nothing to do
[1104.08 - 1112.00] with the programs of releasing dangerous
[1108.00 - 1114.64] chemicals and toxins from planes into
[1112.00 - 1118.40] our skies and on top of us. But it's a
[1114.64 - 1120.48] decoy. It's a trick just like the old
[1118.40 - 1123.68] weather balloons. The contrail
[1120.48 - 1126.52] explanation out there is there to soothe
[1123.68 - 1129.52] the beast. It's there to make scientists
[1126.52 - 1132.48] happy. It's there to make people feel
[1129.52 - 1134.96] good. It's there to convince people
[1132.48 - 1137.44] there isn't anything sinister happening
[1134.96 - 1141.12] in the sky above them. The sinister
[1137.44 - 1144.08] evildoers learn to weaponize contrails,
[1141.12 - 1146.56] the term contrail. And in the end, it's
[1144.08 - 1148.56] just an ultimate con. There's a lot of
[1146.56 - 1151.28] darkness out there. There's a lot of
[1148.56 - 1154.08] evildoers out there doing despicable
[1151.28 - 1157.84] things to people on this planet. And
[1154.08 - 1160.48] this one belongs in the top 10 list of
[1157.84 - 1162.24] assaults on humanity. So, next time you
[1160.48 - 1164.80] think about a chemtrail or you see
[1162.24 - 1167.52] something out there or someone talks
[1164.80 - 1169.92] about a chemtrail being a contrail or
[1167.52 - 1172.88] something on the internet that's saying
[1169.92 - 1174.76] that contrails are actually chemtrails
[1172.88 - 1178.08] and that there isn't any
[1174.76 - 1180.16] chemtrails and that geoengineering isn't
[1178.08 - 1184.20] the spraying of all kinds of dangerous
[1180.16 - 1187.36] toxic metals. If a media outlet or news
[1184.20 - 1189.20] authority believes it's just contrails
[1187.36 - 1192.92] or is trying to tell people that's what
[1189.20 - 1195.28] it is as if science is backing it up and
[1192.92 - 1198.72] definitively it is a contrail not a
[1195.28 - 1201.48] chemtrail and sources like Wikipedia
[1198.72 - 1204.72] which is really fakeedia says it's
[1201.48 - 1208.00] contrails and that chemtrails just don't
[1204.72 - 1210.32] exist then you know it's just weaponized
[1208.00 - 1212.00] or they're working for darkness or
[1210.32 - 1214.72] working for peace. people who have
[1212.00 - 1217.40] immense power on the planet. So when you
[1214.72 - 1220.52] see a streak in the sky, when you see a
[1217.40 - 1222.72] chemtrail, don't be fooled. It's not a
[1220.52 - 1225.52] contrail. And when you do see these
[1222.72 - 1229.04] chemtrails up in the sky, sometimes
[1225.52 - 1232.64] hundreds of them as they fan out as the
[1229.04 - 1235.44] jets go by, when you do see them, keep
[1232.64 - 1238.96] in mind what you're seeing isn't being
[1235.44 - 1241.52] dropped on you. What you're seeing isn't
[1238.96 - 1242.76] coming down on you. You're not breathing
[1241.52 - 1244.48] in those
[1242.76 - 1247.36] chemtrails. You're breathing in
[1244.48 - 1250.40] chemtrails that you can't see, that have
[1247.36 - 1253.44] already fallen, that were dropped many,
[1250.40 - 1255.52] many miles away and floated your
[1253.44 - 1258.56] direction, but they're not in the sky
[1255.52 - 1261.44] anymore. And the ones you see in the sky
[1258.56 - 1263.60] are going to fall somewhere else, very
[1261.44 - 1266.80] far away from you. So when you look in
[1263.60 - 1269.36] the sky, don't fear those chemtrails.
[1266.80 - 1271.44] Those aren't coming your way. Don't
[1269.36 - 1273.60] worry about those chemtrails. They're
[1271.44 - 1276.96] not affecting you. There's already
[1273.60 - 1279.52] chemtrails in the air for everybody all
[1276.96 - 1281.84] the time. Not only in the United States,
[1279.52 - 1284.20] but all over the entire planet. We
[1281.84 - 1286.48] breathe them in every single day we step
[1284.20 - 1289.52] outside. We even breathe them in a
[1286.48 - 1291.84] little bit in our own homes. They seep
[1289.52 - 1294.40] in during the night and during the
[1291.84 - 1296.72] daytime. They're nothing to fear.
[1294.40 - 1298.56] They've been up there since the 1960s
[1296.72 - 1301.20] when the program started. And we're
[1298.56 - 1304.16] going to go into detail all about it,
[1301.20 - 1306.80] who's behind it, what's occurring, when
[1304.16 - 1309.20] it's occurring, how to protect yourself,
[1306.80 - 1312.80] and how to cleanse out and clean out the
[1309.20 - 1315.68] many toxins. In the upcoming episodes in
[1312.80 - 1318.44] our chemtrail and geoengineering series.

[1329.56 - 1338.80] you. Look up in the
[1332.92 - 1342.60] sky. The blue has faded. I wonder why.
[1338.80 - 1346.08] Did the weatherman lie? Or have we been
[1342.60 - 1349.28] jaded? I see some jet planes up there.
[1346.08 - 1352.40] They're not that high. No, they're
[1349.28 - 1355.12] flying pretty low. What do you know? The
[1352.40 - 1359.36] plane is leaving a trail. How is that?
[1355.12 - 1362.56] So, look, so many more to go. I'm losing
[1359.36 - 1365.76] count. How insane. They're just laying
[1362.56 - 1367.40] it out. I feel we're getting blasted.
[1365.76 - 1370.80] It's as thick as
[1367.40 - 1373.68] molasses. This is flight 222 calling the
[1370.80 - 1377.28] base. How does it look down there? A
[1373.68 - 1381.16] painted sky. No questions asked. Kept a
[1377.28 - 1385.04] straight face. This is the base. Flight
[1381.16 - 1387.60] 222. Landed airirstrip New Mexico if
[1385.04 - 1391.20] you're through. Refill the tanks and
[1387.60 - 1395.12] back up you go. Roger that base. This is
[1391.20 - 1398.60] flight 666 to the base. I made an X over
[1395.12 - 1401.52] the interstate. Flight 666. This is the
[1398.60 - 1404.64] base. I see you're keeping your chin up
[1401.52 - 1408.96] while releasing the white lace. Roger
[1404.64 - 1411.68] that. This is flight 666 base. Can I ask
[1408.96 - 1415.80] you another personal question? Do you
[1411.68 - 1420.24] believe in God? This is the base. Fight
[1415.80 - 1424.20] 666. In this work, God has no place.
[1420.24 - 1427.60] This is fight 222. I'm back on route. I
[1424.20 - 1430.88] overheard that I'm a god-fearing man.
[1427.60 - 1435.76] Base. Are you saying God's not part of
[1430.88 - 1440.08] the plan? This is the base. Flight 222
[1435.76 - 1445.68] and flight 666. Just be men and keep on
[1440.08 - 1445.68] spraying the chem. Roger that. Roger

[1477.56 - 1481.92] Original published medical medium
[1479.76 - 1484.48] information gets stolen and poached by

[1486.40 - 1490.00] Medical medium information has never yet
[1488.16 - 1492.00] been proven wrong by medical science and

[1492.00 - 1495.60] proven right and then taken from medical
[1493.68 - 1497.28] medium published material and used in
[1495.60 - 1499.28] the conventional and alternative health
[1497.28 - 1501.28] communities. Medical medium information
[1499.28 - 1502.80] continually sets the stage for medical
[1501.28 - 1504.80] science to understand chronic illness
[1502.80 - 1506.72] better. If you choose to share or use
[1504.80 - 1508.72] the original unique content from the

[1518.80 - 1522.48] losing years of their life searching for
[1520.56 - 1524.32] answers like so many have before them.
[1522.48 - 1526.32] The medical medium information here on
[1524.32 - 1528.24] this podcast doesn't come from broken

[1535.12 - 1538.80] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1537.12 - 1540.64] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1538.80 - 1542.56] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1540.64 - 1544.48] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1542.56 - 1546.32] before in our modern-day history, it
[1544.48 - 1548.16] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1546.32 - 1549.92] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1548.16 - 1551.60] Medical medium information has street
[1549.92 - 1552.80] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1551.60 - 1554.64] countless people around the world
[1552.80 - 1556.40] healing more healing stories of real
[1554.64 - 1558.56] people not being paid to tell their
[1556.40 - 1560.16] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1558.56 - 1562.24] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1560.16 - 1563.92] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1562.24 - 1565.52] their lives back and finally healing
[1563.92 - 1566.88] when nothing else in the world of health
