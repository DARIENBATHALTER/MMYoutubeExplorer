had that kind of something else going on

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
but what else are you doing what else is

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
happening

everybody i want them

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
to everybody to be their own detective

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
on something like that

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
um do you have nutritional yeast in your

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
diet do you have eggs in your diet and

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,759
you probably don't have any of that

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,680
right do you have caffeine in your diet

56
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,560
you have vinegar in your diet

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
um do you have things like that going on

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,319
natural flavors in your diet

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,319
so those things you got to make sure

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,680
aren't happening right there

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,200
and um and so another thing too

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,480
is celery juice kills off pathogens so

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,239
it kills off

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,319

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
um and you know it's not just celery

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
juice

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
you know even though celery juice is one

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,199
medical medium tool

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,720
but why is that tool so powerful just as

194
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,479
i was gonna go into detail about the

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
power it has and why it's so powerful i

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
think

197
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
it's important to know really because i

198
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
i kind of brush by it a lot

199
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
and it's easy to kind of just be like oh

200
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
my god celery juice okay and i and i

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
brush by it and i don't talk

202
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
about the power it holds and the details

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
and that

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,240
um simply some simple healing

205
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,759
uh i did but then got too much detox

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
doing that every day so i did 16 ounces

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
um every other day and worked my way up

208
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
so that's to elena that's that's

209
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,400
incredible

210
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,319
that's actually a perfect idea and it

211
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,440

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,560
if you guys are old enough for this but

313
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
the chronic illness world was the world

314
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,920
of no one got better

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
that's it you were chronically sick with

316
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
something whether it's migraines aches

317
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
and pains fibro

318
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
neurological symptoms and you stayed

319
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,839
sick and lyme disease whatever it was

320
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,440
you stayed sick

321
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
and what happened was all these years

322
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
people who came to me when i was

323
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
actually doing the work one-on-one all

324
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
those years would get the answers

325
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
and everybody would say write a book

326
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
write a book write a book they'd get the

327
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,279
answers and they would get better

328
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,720
and everybody would even talk about

329
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
including doctors and practitioners

330
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
people i knew all through the years that

331
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
the world of chronic illness was no one

332
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
got better

333
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,600
and that's it that's you just stayed

334
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,040
sick and you tried things and if a

335
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
doctor got someone better with the

336
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
chronic illness

337
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
one person a year was a miracle back

338
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
then and so the medical medium

339
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
information kind of blew the roof

340
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,160
off of everybody being sick and

341
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
this is this great opportunity for

342
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,240
people to heal celery juice was one of

343
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
those

344
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
powerful tools that moved people forward

345
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
and got them better

346
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
and so the medical beam community

347
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
actually is the community that people

348
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
heal in and then the other communities

349
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
started taking cues they started taking

350
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
little pieces of it like

351
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,959
they take the celery juice and they try

352
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
not to talk about it too much because

353
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,200
medical medium

354
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
or they because they want their

355
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,079
community to you know shine or whatever

356
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
it is and they

357
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,160
and they take the little tidbits that

358
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
medical medium was teaching all these

359
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
years

360
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
third person right there teaching all

361
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,120
these years going back for decades and

362
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
decades

363
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
and it's really amazing how far we've

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
come because of mm info

365
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,760

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,760
fact uh fact that science research

368
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,440
are taking information on adhd and

369
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,279

370
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,240

all kinds of other information

373
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,959
more and more stuff comes out every day

374
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
from science and research that

375
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800

445
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,360
messenger that gets the crap being

446
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,600
kicked out of them

447
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,399
for getting too many people better

448
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,480
because you're not

449
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
allowed to actually get people better

450
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
you can talk

451
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
about it getting people better the

452
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
communities can talk about it everybody

453
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
can stay sick

454
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,279
doctors can talk about but when you

455
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,160
start getting millions better around the

456
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,279
world

457
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,399
it's attention you don't want because

458
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,440
that's against

459
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,560
the rules baby against the rules they

460
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,639
want people sick

461
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
they want them to stay sick they don't

462
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,480
want celery juice changing the world

463
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,079
that's why the media wasn't kind to me

464
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
over and over and over again with celery

465
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,560
juice

466
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,880

467
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480

470
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000

471
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,639

kinds so i'm going to talk about that

659
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
for a minute

660
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,720
um doctors try to treat migraines with

661
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,360
drug cocktails try this benzodiazepine

662
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,159
here

663
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,760
that might help try this antidepressant

664
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
the present that might help

665
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,799
try this anti-anxiety med that might

666
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,799
help try this

667
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,600
anti-inflammatory that could help

668
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,640
let's try a combination of all of it

669
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,159
let's try this

670
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,240
you know serotonin inhibitor

671
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,880
anyway let's try this biologic

672
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,320
whatever okay people just they get

673
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,080
thrown all these cocktails because the

674
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,840
migraines get so bad so your doctor's

675
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,480
throwing all this stuff

676
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,280
okay if one group of drugs doesn't work

677
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
your doctor will put you on another and

678
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,360
another

679
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,880
until you start to experience some

680
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,640
symptom relief if you

681
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,960
do however side effects of the drugs can

682
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,240
create entirely new problems

683
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,120
and they do benzodiazepines you've got a

684
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,880
whole another host of crap going down

685
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,080
all bunch of problems right um

686
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
plus they might work only temporarily

687
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
in some cases the body can develop

688
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,159
resistance to a drug over time

689
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,039
yet weaning yourself off the medication

690
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,840
can trigger migraines too

691
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,520
weaning off the medication can trigger

692
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,080
migraines too if you guys just came on

693
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,679

from this book though it's coming see

734
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,400

that the science research does

736
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,360
right and then all the doctors

737
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,360
practitioners take a little bit of the

738
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,679
neurotoxins do that so you're cleaning

753
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
it up getting it better

754
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,200
all right medical communities don't know

755
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
what causes most migraines that's in

756
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,559
part why they have a haphazard approach

757
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,679
to treating them

758
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,679
haphazard medical communities are

759
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
haphazardous so far the big theory is

760
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,039
that a neuropeptide released in the

761
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,760
trigeminal system

762
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
cranial nerves results in head pain for

763
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,919
people particularly sensitive to the

764
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,679
compound

765
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,120
that would be great if that theory was

766
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,200
real

767
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,039
but that's a theory and that's all they

768
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,320
got did you hear that you guys that's

769
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
all they have

770
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,080
they think it's a theory by the way the

771
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,039
big theory

772
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,320
that's a theory they don't have any

773
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,240
thoughts or answers i mean they don't

774
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
have any facts it's a theory no study

775
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
shows it

776
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
the big theory is that a neuropeptide

777
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,919
released in the trigeminal system

778
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
results in a headache that's the theory

779
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,200
they've never seen that neuropeptide

780
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,600
doesn't exist but some brainiac

781
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,320
person from some institute or some

782
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,159
whatever

783
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
came up with the thought that that might

784
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,880
be it and

785
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,159
that's all they got billions of dollars

786
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
in research that's all they got but i

787
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,760
forgot that's right

788
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,039
they just care about the next matcha tea

789
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,559
study right

790
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
they don't care about all the migraine

791
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,320
sufferers and people literally

792
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
losing their lives over migraines or

793
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,080
living a life that's just

794
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,000
you know really really hard they just

795
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,400
want that next matcha tea

796
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
discovery of an antioxidant that does

797
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,360
nothing

798
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,000
so that people will get more addicted to

799
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,760
caffeine more and more and more

800
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,480

850
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
theories

include all in your gut that's all i

852
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,760
hear

853
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
all in your gut great one we don't know

854
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,240
why

855
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,679
and you're sick conventional medicine

856
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
alternative medicine now but it's all in

857
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,360
your gut

858
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,120
oh it's the microorganism theory first

859
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,679
of all the microorganism thing came from

860
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,840
medical meetings worked for 35 years

861
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,679
and they took it they took it they took

862
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,200
it i lectured about it taught stores

863
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,240
about it like health food stores all

864
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
around the country

865
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
i taught about lecture circuits i taught

866
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,360
about in churches

867
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,039
i was in church basements in front of

868
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,799
500 700 800

869
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,200
000 people all through the 1990s

870
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,559
and teaching about microorganisms and

871
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,520
everything and then all of a sudden

872
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,440
years later oh

873
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,760
no it's microorganisms it's all in your

874
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,440
gut we don't see those microorganisms

875
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,880
really we don't know what they do we

876
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
don't know anything but your migraines

877
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,120
are from your gut

878
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,840
everything's from your gut now like what

879
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,679
what a what what a ridiculous you know

880
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
statement really it's not that's not an

881
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,440
answer

882
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,159
it's not an answer because people can

883
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
hear that

884
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,080
take all the probiotics and gut health

885
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,440
products they want their migraines to be

886
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,200
killing them you know

887
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
flashes in the eyes migraines in the

888
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
back of their head

889
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,640
temples killing them can't function

890
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,080
can't even speak or talk but no it's all

891
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,080
in your gut i mean it's not an

892
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,159
answer oh my doctor was injecting botox

893
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,760
into my skull to stop my migraines i

894
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,679
didn't even talk about that

895
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
meaning like i know i've seen that out

896
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,360

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,159
so that's what they do they have they

901
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,159
inject botox in the back

902
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,640

all right let's go a little bit more

908
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,480
there's more stuff to go so uh

909
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,159
so and with women they usually just say

910
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,440
it's hormones that's another thing so

911
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,519
i'm reading the book right now medical

912
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,200
medium new edition of just got on here

913
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
and they'll just think it's hormones

914
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,080
that's what they'll think it's that's

915
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,440
just everything's hormones that's your

916
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
hormones you're sick well that's your

917
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
hormones

918
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,360
you're a woman you're it's your hormones

919
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,760
that's why you're sick you don't feel

920
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,679
good

921
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,440
it's your hormones whoa you're you got

922
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,080
depression that's your hormones what you

923
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
got anxiety

924
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,840
it's your hormones right because that's

925
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,360
what it is um you got chronic fatigue

926
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,200
syndrome it's your hormones

927
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,799
that's what it is it's like hormones

928
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,440
hormones and hormone playing that blame

929
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,120
that was since 1950 and that that was

930
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,480
really difficult on so many women um

931
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,960
so yeah anyway okay

932
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,720
in fact it's often not just one thing

933
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,399
but a combination of issues that trigger

934
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,760
a migraine it's a combination of issues

935
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,880
for so many people that trigger a

936
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,200

how's it possible it gets anything

better first of all it's herbal medicine

994
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799

quantity of this herbal medicine

996
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,440

997
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,399
this herbal medicine doesn't have

998
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,360
alkaloids

999
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,640

for a second

1052

don't add anything to your celery juice

1053
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
if you want it to work it has to be

1054
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,800
straight

1055
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,839
celery if you want it to work i'm just

1056
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,119
telling you guys

1057
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,760
has to be straight celery okay

1058
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,560
if you want it to work it's so important

1059
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,320
to know

1060
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,000
right so important to know gonna get

1061
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,480
this stick right these sticks are

1062
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,640
crazy big this is the biggest sticks

1063
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,920
i've seen in a long time

1064
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,040
don't add water don't add ice

1065
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,800
dilutes the sodium cluster salt that is

1066
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,119
saving everybody's butt because the

1067
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,079
sodium cluster salt

1068
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,240
actually destroys pathogens so what

1069
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,920
everybody does is they have some gluten

1070
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,800
and they feed pathogen

1071
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,240
they have gluten they feed the pathogens

1072
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,640
they have eggs

1073
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,640
they feed the pathogens they spray

1074
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,680
perfume on themselves which is toxic

1075
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,280
heavy metals which feeds the pathogens

1076
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,040
and everybody's just feeding their

1077
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,800
pathogens and then what happens is when

1078
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,480
you do your celery juice you're killing

1079
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,280
off your packages

1080
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
see how that works

1081
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,400

ashimoto's thyroiditis you know what's

1084
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,440
really crazy about hashimoto's

1085
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,920
all these years all it means is just

1086
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,520
inflamed thyroid nobody knows why

1087
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,480
science research has a theory that your

1088
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,240
body's attacking

1089
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,599
your thyroid your body's immune system

1090
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,599
is attacking your thyroid

1091
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,200
wrong it's just a theory never they

1092
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,200
never saw it they never proved it

1093
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,800
theory it's not the immune system

1094
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,880
attacking the thyroid it's epstein-barr

1095
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
virus which now

1096
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,960

1100
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,480
rob says i am a naturopath a

matter where the information comes from

1104
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,359
it works and i have tried it how many

1105
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,400
times do you need to do

1106
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,839
a liver cleanse to get better

1107
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,200
depends on each person are they viral

1108
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,839
are we talking about low-grade viruses

1109
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,520
are we talking about i've seen bars

1110
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,839
shingles hhv-6

1111
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,839
cytomegalovirus do they have cold sores

1112
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,960
ask your patient do you had get cold

1113
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,560
sores

1114
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,000
ask them if they ever had a cold sore

1115
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,520
that means they got the simplex one

1116
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,240
inside their liver so you got to kind of

1117
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,280
say well

1118
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,320
how many pathogens bugs are inside the

1119
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,079
liver that's one thing

1120
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,320
too do they have any symptoms are they

1121
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,920
fatigued do they have an aches and pains

1122
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,720
any neurological symptoms

1123
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,160
um that's something to us to consider of

1124
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,760
neurological symptoms

1125
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,680
and if they have neurological symptoms

1126
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,599
then we're dealing with definitely an

1127
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,240
epstein-barr we're dealing with probably

1128
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,920
one or

1129
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,599
two varieties epstein-barr this is how i

1130
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,359
help doctors

1131
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,880
and and so those are some things right

1132
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,000
there do they have metals

1133
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
if they're sick with a lot of

1134
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,520
neurological symptoms then they'll be

1135
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,440
viral with metals so they'll have

1136
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,599
viruses with metals that means the

1137
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,440
epstein bar the shingles is feeding off

1138
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,280
of toxic heavy metals

1139
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
and then releasing the neurotoxin so if

1140
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,160
you get people with fibro you get them

1141
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,079
with lupus you get them with multiple

1142
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,960
sclerosis you get them with cfs

1143
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,720
me you're dealing with viruses with

1144
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,320
toxic heavy metals mercury being

1145
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,760
predominant so then the viruses are

1146
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,160
feeding off of mercury then

1147
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,280
releasing the neurotoxin that neurotoxin

1148
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
inflames the nerves are they getting

1149
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,320
vertigo tinnitus are they getting

1150
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,320
dizziness are they getting focused

1151
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,040
concentration brain fog

1152
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,640
then you got more metals you got more

1153
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
you know stuff and then

1154
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,920
what kind of food are they on are they

1155
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,599
on nutritional yeast are they on the

1156
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,079
number one food group in the world

1157
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,240
caffeine okay just got to try to chip

1158
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,680
them away off that get them off the cafe

1159
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,040
are they on the gluten are they on the

1160
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
eggs these are all the things checked

1161
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
onto your patients see what they're

1162
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,240
doing

1163
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,760
and always know your patient might not

1164
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
be ready and you know this your seasoned

1165
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
doctor

1166
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,920
you you know that your patient might not

1167
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
be ready to drop the gluten or your

1168
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,560
patient might not be ready to

1169
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,520
drop the eggs or

1170
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,800
drop the dairy or drop the caffeine so

1171
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,400
then you're like whoa we got to make

1172
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,920
sure you do more of a liver cleanse or

1173
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,319
an additional liver cleanse

1174
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,079
so these are the variables right there

1175
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,599
these are just some of the variables

1176
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,000
you know there's a lot more variables to

1177
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,960
actually work with that's just some

1178
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,560
and the new edition really talks about

1179
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,240
the variables and explains it in

1180
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,560
in depth um too so that counts as well

1181
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,079
um cleans the heel is a great book as

1182
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,079
well so let me pour this right here

1183
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,599
still going to talk about celery just a

1184
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
little bit and the power celery juice

1185
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,960
has

1186
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,960
okay

1187
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,760
just gonna someone said he's using a

1188
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,599
metal strainer he's using a metal

1189
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,079
strainer i saw that the other day

1190
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,520
isn't he worried no i do a heavy metal

1191
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,200
detox smoothie every single day you

1192
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
can't avoid metal you're gonna you're

1193
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,520
not it's hard to avoid metal everywhere

1194
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
in your life it's falling out of the sky

1195
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,880
metal is falling

1196
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,480
out of the sky you're breathing it in

1197
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,480
you have to keep that in mind that

1198
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,160
you're breathing your metal

1199
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,520
in so you know

1200
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,839
that that's what people are doing

1201
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,359
they're breathing their metals in

1202
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,640
that's just some place that's just one

1203
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,240
place hilly says i'm so hungry when

1204
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,839
i do the cleanses are you getting enough

1205
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,520
calories which cleanse are you doing

1206
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,280
you're doing the 369 advance you might

1207
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,319
get hungry on that one that one's pretty

1208
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,280
strict

1209
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,160
and but you can increase some of the

1210
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
different fruits

1211
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,839
maybe add a little bit more smoothie as

1212
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,280
you kept more calories you're doing the

1213
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,800
mono eating cleanse you can increase

1214
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,880
more potato in there

1215
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,079
you can get more calories to offset

1216
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,520
being so hungry

1217
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,359
that's an option right there that's what

1218
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,680
i would do that's what i would do that's

1219
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,119
all

1220
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,880
um so i just juiced this beautiful

1221
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,079
celery juice right here

1222
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,599
so rano sir anthony

1223
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,119
can you explain to us what happens

1224
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:26,160
in the body during a migraine attack

1225
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,839
yeah definitely all right so um

1226
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,160
i wish i had some nerves and hey i got a

1227
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,000
brain

1228
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,560
got a brain here somewhere so i got this

1229
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,839
additional brain see so well those are

1230
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,119
metals right there right i got the

1231
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,560
little metal

1232
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,119
demo you see them they're shining a

1233
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,560
little bit okay so here's one reason why

1234
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,480
we get migraine attacks

1235
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,560
overheating of the brain so you got this

1236
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,040
electricity swimming around your brain

1237
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
swimming around electrical current right

1238
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,920
it's running through synapsis

1239
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,440
it's uh it's riding on neurons

1240
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,560
electrical currents

1241
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,839
and what happens is when you get toxic

1242
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,560
heavy metal issues

1243
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,160
that's a big one a big one for migraines

1244
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,680
and i'll talk about it in the book right

1245
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,920
there

1246
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,160
your brain overheats because the

1247
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,680
electricity is ricocheting off a metal

1248
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,800
it's riding on metal

1249
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,480
it's it's it's being interfered with so

1250
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,440
electricity running through

1251
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,040
your neurons neurotransmitters start to

1252
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,240
burn out when metals are in there

1253
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,680
because you're overheating so it's a

1254
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,000
constant overheating in the brain so the

1255
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,200
migraines come on easy just thoughts can

1256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,400
bring on migrants just

1257
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,079
because if it takes electricity to think

1258
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,560
and then if you're under stress

1259
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,560
it takes that then you're actually

1260
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,319
really pumping that electricity and if

1261
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,960
you ever anybody ever gets angry if you

1262
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,760
ever get

1263
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,200
angry or upset you get hot headed right

1264
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,040
get the hot headed

1265
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,880
you know when you blow a cork in your

1266
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,640
hot headed no there's a tremendous

1267
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,800
amount of heat generated

1268
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,079
electricity and if you got them if you

1269
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,520
got the the metals

1270
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,119
you don't even have to get hot-headed

1271
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,839
you don't even have to get

1272
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,319
angry to get the migraines i mean it can

1273
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,920
happen

1274
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,520
just from the mercury just from the

1275
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,200
aluminum deposits to the mercury

1276
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,280
aluminum different parts of the brain

1277
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,560
that's just on the midline canal i mean

1278
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,520
just putting them in different spots

1279
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,040
right here

1280
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,800
so you know but yeah perfumes colognes

1281
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,520
is a great trigger perfumes and clones

1282
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,640
is a toxic it's basically toxic waste

1283
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,000
so perfumes and clones after

1284
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,760
shaves all of that are triggers

1285
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,040
because they're chemical poisons

1286
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,560
okay i'm going to read a couple of the

1287
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,599
triggers right here that's just i just

1288
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
given you one

1289
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,280
variety one reason another thing is if

1290
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,200
you have a viral headache

1291
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,720
like the epstein-barr headaches or the

1292
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
shingles headaches that's the other one

1293
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,920
too

1294
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,319
so you've got all these cranial nerves

1295
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
okay

1296
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,440
running across the face you got all

1297
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,960
these cranial nerves that's another

1298
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,400
thing too

1299
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,800
so you got these cranial nerves got the

1300
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,040
trigeminal nerve right you got the

1301
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,560
facial nerve so you've got these cranial

1302
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,560
nerves cranial nerves get

1303
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,319
lit up by neurotoxin so if you're

1304
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,240
somebody that deals with simplex one and

1305
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,079
you get a cold sore once a year

1306
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,760
that virus sits inside the trigeminal

1307
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,079
nerve um

1308
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
and it sits inside cranial nerves so

1309
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
you'll end up getting headaches from

1310
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,040
that virus you can also have shingles

1311
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,640
the neurotoxin from shingles

1312
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,240
creates all kinds of head pain

1313
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,520
periodically all through somebody's life

1314
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,000
in migraines

1315
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,319
um epstein-barr can release a lot of

1316
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,720
neurotoxins those neurotoxins inflame

1317
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,480
nerves too and they inflame cranial

1318
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,680
nerves and that's another reason why you

1319
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,319
get headaches i'm just giving you as

1320
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,440
many

1321
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,839
different migraines and i already told

1322
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,599
you guys about the simplexes right

1323
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,720
right so uh the usual suspects right

1324
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,960
are concussion meningitis

1325
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,400
stroke those are suspects so it's like

1326
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,079
well if you had a stroke

1327
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,240
and then you get headaches after a

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,640
um tiny ischemic stroke right um

1378
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,079
brain aneurysm this is these are just

1379
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,839
obvious migraine stuff but this is the

1380
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,680
obvious stuff right

1381
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,040
brain tumor obvious but i told you

1382
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,040
people can have brain tumors and not

1383
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,040
have uh the migraine brain cyst

1384
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,599
microcyst that can do it repeated

1385
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,800
cervical nerves okay so here we go

1386
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,720
um let's go into a little bit more

1387
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
there's so many things there's there's

1388
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,599
the stress trigger

1389
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,599
okay i told you about the overheating

1390
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,440
that's one menstrual cycle

1391
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,359
trigger so let's read a little bit of

1392
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,440
that right there it's going to

1393
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,960
many female migraine sufferers notice

1394
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,640
that their migraines come on right

1395
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,359
before during or after the menstrual

1396
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,520
cycle right

1397
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,119
i mean that's really common it's like

1398
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,520
during the menstrual cycle i got my

1399
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,440
migraine coming on i got it coming on

1400
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,960
okay this is because when a woman is

1401
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,920
menstruating her reproductive system

1402
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,440
requires 80

1403
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,200
of her body's immune system so here's

1404
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
how it works when you go into your cycle

1405
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,720
80

1406
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,440
of your immune system goes to your

1407
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,760
reproductive system 20

1408
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,359
is now just what's going on through your

1409
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,079
body right to cover the rest of your

1410
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,839
body

1411
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,160
and when that happens it you you could

1412
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,839
be

1413
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,880
fending off other things you could be

1414
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,440
fending off heavy metal toxicity

1415
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,520
epstein-barr strep all these different

1416
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,480
things your immune system is now

1417
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,680
occupied on menstruation and so

1418
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,520
therefore

1419
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,520
everything else is fair game now it's

1420
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,079
like epstein-barr can creep up and cause

1421
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,160
a problem

1422
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,200
your strep that causes acne can cause

1423
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,680
problems and now you're getting more

1424
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,640
acne you get migraines too from all

1425
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,440
these things

1426
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,599
um and so that's that's this is a this

1427
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,920
is the reason for a large

1428
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,880
amount a large proportion of women that

1429
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,240
are suffering

1430
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,760
okay and the book lists all the triggers

1431
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,200
this is the medical medium new edition

1432
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,319
i'm reading all the triggers right here

1433
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
i have it i don't know if you guys can

1434
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,800
see it see all my post-it notes

1435
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,800
all around the triggers okay

1436
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
so um heavy metals and other

1437
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,880
environmental toxic triggers so

1438
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,640
perfumes cologne said to candles other

1439
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,119
toxins laundry detergents

1440
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,920
major trigger right there fabric

1441
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,400
softeners

1442
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,079
boom major trigger on its own pesticides

1443
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,680
herbicides around a building an

1444
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,920
apartment building or in

1445
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,720
the yard or anything like that that's

1446
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,119
another one too

1447
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,960
sinus related migraines streptococcus

1448
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,559
causes chronic sinusitis

1449
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,720
and now you're in this whole thing where

1450
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,400
you're getting chronic sinusitis

1451
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,520
migraines that's another trigger all in

1452
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,280
it so i'm giving you guys

1453
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,599
whatever i can here there's so many of

1454
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,880
them okay

1455
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,480
caffeine caffeine yep

1456
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,960
we try to treat our migraines with

1457
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,880
caffeine seems to give us some relief

1458
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,319
but then that migraine comes back worse

1459
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,200
than ever because that's what caffeine

1460
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,200
does

1461
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,280
it's what goes up must come down what

1462
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,280
goes up must come down it's the caffeine

1463
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,760
nightmare okay so coffee drinks matcha

1464
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,000
tea chocolate cacao and other caffeine

1465
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,599
over stimulating and hot and highly

1466
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,440
aggressive to the central nervous system

1467
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,599
caffeine acts as a neurotoxin that can

1468
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,960
trigger migraines

1469
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,480
some people claim that chocolate and

1470
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,160
other forms of caffeine can help a

1471
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,559
migraine because the truth is these

1472
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
people

1473
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,160
are in and out of withdrawal you're in

1474
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,880
you're out

1475
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,000
got one step and one step out we're

1476
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,960
gonna do a little dance

1477
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,359
right that's it you're in in you're in

1478
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,440
or

1479
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,200
and out of withdrawal so you're back and

1480
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,880
forth back and forth

1481
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,720
that's what's going on there they've

1482
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,400
experienced that effect because caffeine

1483
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,319
triggers the adrenals to flood the body

1484
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,520
with adrenaline which acts as a steroid

1485
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,640
for the inflammation that causes

1486
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,680
migraine so what you do

1487
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,720
you get high in the caffeine and then it

1488
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,160
acts as a steroid

1489
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,520
because it's triggering your adrenals

1490
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,960
your adrenals are flooding all this

1491
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,400
epinephrine and now you're getting the

1492
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,319
epinephrine effect it's like the bee

1493
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,599
stinging treatment right you know the

1494
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,000
bee sting treatment

1495
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,880
okay that people do that bee stinging

1496
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,200
treatment

1497
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,119
gives you the ultimate adrenaline high

1498
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,640
because you just got stung

1499
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,800
by a bee it's not getting you better

1500
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,880
it's not going to heal you because the

1501
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,079
bee sting treatment can't heal you but

1502
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,480
what it does

1503
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,240
is it causes your adrenals to flood a

1504
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,680
tremendous amount of epinephrine because

1505
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,319
you're stung by a bee

1506
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,359
that epinephrine is self-steroidal

1507
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,280
treatment so you're

1508
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,800
treating with self steroids that's what

1509
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,839
the bee sting therapy is

1510
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,359
it's you're using your own adrenaline to

1511
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,400
and that's medical medium information

1512
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,200
nobody knows why the bees things work or

1513
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,839
band-aid that's the point they don't fix

1514
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,319
a disease

1515
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,760
condition they band-aid things for the

1516
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,000
moment right

1517
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,839
and so the bee sting therapy is band-aid

1518
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,359
nobody knew why they band-aid

1519
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,200
but i've been teaching why they band-aid

1520
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,720
for years it's because once you get

1521
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,359
stung by the bees so you put the bee in

1522
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,040
the cup

1523
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,319
you stick don't do this i'm not saying

1524
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,680
do this do not do this i'm not

1525
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,760
recommending this but you put the b

1526
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,280
they put the b in the cup they stick the

1527
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,040
beat the cup on their leg

1528
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,559
the b kind of swims around in the cup

1529
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,240
for a little bit and then it goes down

1530
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,800
to the leg and then goes boom and you're

1531
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,640
stung

1532
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,079
and then your adrenals are flooding

1533
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,400
flooding flooding flooding

1534
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,359
and now you're being self-treated with

1535
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,720
adrenaline

1536
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,040
you got a steroid you're being

1537
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,440
self-treated see how it works

1538
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,440
well same thing with caffeine with

1539
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,559
migraines in other conditions

1540
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
it's self treating that's what you're

1541
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,960
doing you're self

1542
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,880
treating with adrenaline so i'm gonna

1543
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,480
get jacked up and high on caffeine

1544
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,839
i'm gonna do it now that everybody keeps

1545
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,440
on saying it's good for you i really

1546
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,599
feel like i can do it it's freaky

1547
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,960
for you know fair game i could do it

1548
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,559
free game let's do it

1549
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,839
and you're doing all the caffeine and

1550
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,960
you're you're feeling like you're

1551
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,720
self-treating

1552
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,480
and then all that adrenaline is doing

1553
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,000
that it's trying to get the inflammation

1554
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,400
down and then when that adrenaline wears

1555
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,359
off

1556
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
caffeine wears off boom you're back to

1557
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,040
square one

1558
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,920
you're in you're out of withdrawal all

1559
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,280
right so

1560
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,920
a couple of different things there

1561
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,200
there's gluten is a trigger eggs are a

1562
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,359
trigger

1563
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,559
fermented foods are a trigger for

1564
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,880
migraines okay book

1565
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,720
book covers where to look how to heal

1566
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,839
for your protocols what to do for

1567
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,880
migraine protocols

1568
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,920
all that stuff um anthony charles

1569
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,839
hey great name love the name

1570
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,000
what helps the personalization and

1571
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,520
derealization

1572
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,960
i talked about this as toxic heavy

1573
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,960
metals sometimes a little bit of

1574
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,839
low-grade epstein-barr but mostly toxic

1575
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,559
heavy metals

1576
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,119
de personalization definitely metals are

1577
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,079
in there

1578
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,319
honestly if i was dealing with the

1579
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,000
depersonalization

1580
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,440
i'd be working on getting my metals out

1581
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,040
getting my metals out that's what i

1582
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,599
would be doing right there

1583
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,119
um i would be doing if it was me i'd be

1584
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,800
doing the spirulina

1585
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,640
the barley grass this is the vimergy

1586
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,280
spirulina the vimergy barley grass the

1587
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,800
only ones

1588
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,280
i trust um and i'm not sponsored

1589
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,720

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,920
doctor what he would do just

1591
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,440
listen to your doctor whatever your

1592
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,520
doctor wants to do but this is what i

1593
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,200
would do if i had the personalization

1594
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,839
i would get the medals out if i had the

1595
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,319
personalization

00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:01,760

1629
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,000
medical mean protocols are more than

1630
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,359
just celery juice oil this is one of the

1631
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,440
healing tools

pulp comes out dry

1639

and that's what counts when it comes out

1640
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,079
dry okay

1641
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,480

1643
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,000
celery that's the mm-900 hds it's the

1644
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,359
one i use it's incredible so i just use

1645
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,119
the celery with this okay

1646
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:43,599
megajuicers.com it's the celery juicer

1647
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,200
it's the only model that does the celery

1648
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,200
juice and it does everything else too

1649
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,839
yeah that's funny margaret been

1650
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,920
educating myself no one

1651
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,040
no one putting butter in your coffee

1652
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,119
yeah the

1653
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,960
butter in your coffee is bad idea it's a

1654
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,119
bad idea for so many reasons

1655
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,319
i mean look i'm not trying to you know

1656
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,160
harp on anybody

1657
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,240
out there but i'm just saying that i i

1658
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,760
think that that's probably one of the

1659
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,599
worst you may as well have the eggs in

1660
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,960
the bacon and the toast with it with the

1661
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,760
butter and the coffee

1662
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,079
and um getting jacked up on caffeine all

1663
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,520
on its own is terrible for people just

1664
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,640
terrible

1665
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,079
anyway not organic celery is okay

1666
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,960

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,160
about celery juice what it does is it

1708
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,680

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,400
it starts to clean up old

1710
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,359
debris shouldn't be there petrified

1711
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,280
proteins attach

1712
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,280
the linings rancid fats attach to the

1713
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,000
linings of your intestinal walls

1714
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,319

1715
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,839
goes

1716
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,359
up into your liver so i just want to

1717
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,760
give you this one quick run down right

1718
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,920

juice okay all right hepatic portal

1722
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,400
highway which is your veins going into

1723
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,319
your liver

1724
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,839
that stem off of your intestinal tract

1725
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:12,079
so here it is so

1726
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,079

1731
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,559
tract your celery juice okay

1732
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,920
it ends up going into these tiny blood

1733
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,079
vessels in your

1734
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,680
small intestinal tract and it ends up

1735
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,760
all connecting to the paddock portal

1736
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,240
highway up into your liver

1737
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,799
is where it connects up into your liver

1738
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,319
and so when it gets up into your liver

1739
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,960
that's when the celery juice does its

1740
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,559
magic it starts to revitalize the liver

1741
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,640
sodium cluster salts start to kill off

1742
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,400
epstein-barr shingles other pathogens

1743
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,040
streptococcus you name it it starts to

1744
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,040
clean it all

1745
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,559
up that's one thing it does and guess

1746
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,920
what that celery juice

1747
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,799
finds itself up boop the duct into the

1748
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,799
gallbladder

1749
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,160
starts to loosen up some of that sludge

1750
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,960
and dissolve it

1751
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,720
dissolves gallstones it has a dissolving

1752
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,480
gallstone dissolving power that's what

1753
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,680
the celery juice has these are just some

1754
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,720
of the things it does

1755
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,559
and it's killing pathogens as

1756
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,160
its happenings pathogens that sit in

1757
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,599
people's gallbladders people got strep

1758
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,960
in their gallbladders they get strep

1759
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,280
infections in there

1760
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,000
they get all kinds of other stuff and

1761
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,400
it's the

1762
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,440
killer of the bugs that's what the

1763
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,520
celery juice does

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,240
and it's cleaning up the intestinal

1767
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,839
tract getting rid of old debris trapped

1768
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,280
in pockets slowly

1769
