completely just missed by science and

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,720
research everything toxic heavy metals

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
that are causing all of this pathogens

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,759
that are causing all of this I talk

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,560
about the most Advanced information I

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,079
brought this to town thanks to spirit

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,920
cuz Spirit brought this information to

39
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,680
me since I was a child if you're brand

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,159
new to the medical medium and you don't

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,759
know what's going on check out the

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,159
medical medium books just give it a shot

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,159
look into the medical medium series and

44
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,200
pick out a book that you feel like you

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,000

you could save other lives around you

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,759
this information comes from Beyond and

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
it's already helped Millions over the

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,960
last 35 years so let's move forward

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,520
we're talking about slow

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,880
metabolism and uh celery juice too we're

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,200
always talking about celery juice how it

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,239
helps with metabolism issues but let's

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,360
talk about metabolism Al together like

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,840
what is it a slow metabolism was never

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
behind anybody's symptoms or conditions

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,879
so you need to know that so metabolism

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,920
isn't the cause of somebody being sick

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,120
or a problem happening or a symptom or a

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,360
condition the term

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,400
metabolism is only the discovery of

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,760
being alive so slow metabolism isn't

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,599
responsible for weight gain see that's

65
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,840
that's that's unbelievable right I'll

66
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,360
say it again a slow metabolism when

67
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,519
someone's diagnosed with a slow

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,360
metabolism and diagnosed what does that

69
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,760
mean that means that someone's like oh

70
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,159
you got a slow metabolism oh you must

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
have a fast metabolism oh you must be

72
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,360
one of those people that seem to you

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,120
know have a fast metabolism I mean come

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
on right think about that is that

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,280
advanced is that like Advanced Signs and

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,239
research is that where we are today so

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,959
come on you know a slow metabolism that

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
person's gaining weight so they must

79
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,080
have a slow metabolism I mean let's just

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,440
let's get real let's really get real

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,959
here so the point is is that slow

82
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,280
metabolism that we believe we have the

83
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:25,000
term metabolism is only the discovery of

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,080
being alive that's all it was see it was

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,120
a discovery that something happens when

86
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,400
you put food in your mouth hundreds of

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,879
years ago

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,920
yeah you put food in your mouth and it's

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,239
it's a discovery that blood is moving

90
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,000
through our body blood is actually

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,159
pumping something's pumping blood

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,159
through our veins and arteries that's

93
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,360
what metabolism was the discovery that

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,280
we're a living creature that when you

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,640
consume an energy source via food that

96
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,040
you're utilizing it it's giving you

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,400
energy and you're able to function we're

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,879
alive that's the discovery of metabolism

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,159
by the way way that's the that that's

100
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,760
the great scientific discovery right

101
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,920
there a slow slow metabolism does not

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,159
give us an answer of what can truly go

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,120
wrong to create a condition such as

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,680
weight gain or losing too much weight so

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
when somebody's losing too much weight

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,040
and we say hey they must have a fast

107
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,600
metabolism it's ridiculous it really is

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
cuz that's not how it works see

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,199
metabolism became law it's one of those

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,840
old old grandfathered laws that has

111
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,840
taken over the consciousness of the

112
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,840
human race I know that sounds drastic I

113
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,240
know that sounds a little too much maybe

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,479
but when you really think about it it's

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,400
literally all everybody ever thinks

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,639
about I mean we have so many people

117
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,479
suffering with chronic illness dying or

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,880
living lives that aren't at the fullest

119
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,639
potential it's it's really funny how all

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,600
that self-help self talk out there that

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,800
self-help talk and all that good

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Feelgood positive talk and all the just

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,280
all of it the Law of Attraction talk and

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,520
all of the all the talk out there about

125
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,639
living to our greatest and our greatest

126
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,120
potential which I support I've always

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,120
supported that I've always supported

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,759
living to our greatest potential I've

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,919
always supported living in a positive a

130
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,240
most positive being that we have most

131
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,479
positive sense that we have inside of us

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,919
you know our our souls elevating to a

133
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,479
point of you know being positive living

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,800
at our best you know living life at our

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,199
best the best quality we can can can and

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
the best quality of life we can I've

137
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,960
always subscribed to all of that I've

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,639
always been a supporter of all that but

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,360
then when we think about we leave the

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,800
fact out of all the people that are

141
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,120
struggling and suffering and chronic

142
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,160
illness from young people to teenagers

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,639
to young adults to college students to

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,280
young adults to older people to you know

145
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,840
people middle-aged or however we want to

146
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,680
say it now these days you know everybody

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,120
is struggling and they're struggling de

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,440
with real real chronic issues all the

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,479
time you know debilitating to some you

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,160
know plaguing them to some degree and so

151
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,440
when we think about you living the best

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
quality of life and living their best

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,919
full potential what about the millions

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,680
of people that they can't even think

155
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,960
about that they can't even think about

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,160
you know wh what's the best quality

157
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,160
what's the best greatness they can even

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,440
achieve to when they're suffering and

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
struggling and so when you think about

160
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,039
metabolism

161
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,280
taking over it's almost like another one

162
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,800
of those things to derail people who are

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,520
struggling and suffering is what I'm

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,960
trying to say it's another way of saying

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,319
well you know what it's your metabolism

166
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,840
it's another way of just blowing off

167
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,280
people that are really sick that's what

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,280
it is it's another great mistake I call

169
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,599
it is what I'm trying to say it's

170
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,560
another one of those derail people is

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,400
what I'm trying to say you got people

172
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,759
suffering and struggling left and right

173
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,039
all over the place with all kinds of

174
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,520
symptoms and conditions right and what

175
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,840
we throw at them the best science and

176
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,280
research we go to dietitians we go to

177
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,800
some nutritionists we go to different

178
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,479
people and the best science and research

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,720
get thrown at them it could be your

180
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,039
metabolism it could be that or that's

181
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,840
what's responsible for it and you can't

182
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,039
live to be at your greatest self because

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,039
your metabolism is messed up you can't

184
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,759
get that best quality of life because

185
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,720
your metabolism is messed up maybe

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,039
you're not thinking positive enough

187
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,240
maybe you're creating your own illness

188
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,240
maybe you're creating your own illness

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,319
and it's messing up your metabolism see

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,360
that's what I'm trying to say right here

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
it it's it's it's really something when

192
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,800
you get these roadblocks out there that

193
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
are out there they're set in place to

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
mess you up kind of like the autoimmune

195
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
Theory I always talk about where they

196
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,919
say your body's destroying itself when

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,720
it's not when it was just a theory from

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,120
the 1950s and if you read the books the

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,879
medical medium series books you learn

200
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,840
about how that's not true the body

201
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,440
doesn't attack itself well these other

202
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,919
great mistakes like metabolism and that

203
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,039
and everything being blamed on your

204
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,360
metabolism that's another prime example

205
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,479
of to derail people to confuse them to

206
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,919
throw them off the scent of what they

207
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,879
really need to be doing is why isn't

208
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,560
science in research stepping up to the

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
game why aren't they stepping up and

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
helping out women kind when health

211
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,440
professionals all over the world are

212
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,400
consumed with the term metabolism as if

213
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,720
it holds any Merit any credibility any

214
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,720
science research really any scientific

215
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,400
discovery really when it holds any kind

216
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,360
of credibility it's

217
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,240
unbelievable especially what's going on

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
with people suffering that's why I'm

219
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,320
trying to talk about this a little bit

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
more I mean I'm going to go into

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
metabolism a lot you know a lot more to

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
where we're heading and so just hang in

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
there fasten your seat bels get a cup of

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,200
tea just relax because we're going to

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
cover this and this is going to be good

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,160
but I wanted you guys to make sure that

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,120
you knew how kind of disastrous the

228
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
metabolism theory has been and how it

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
has been a roadblock for so many for so

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
long so when someone's struggling to get

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,600
weight off of them and they're severely

232
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,920
depressed because the weight is bogging

233
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,920
them down they can't function good they

234
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,160
got extra 50 lbs on them extra 70 lbs on

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,360
them they're being made fun of you know

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
they're being not they're not being

237
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
taken seriously they're not being taken

238
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,079
seriously that they even know how to

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
take care of themselves or know how to

240
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,920
take care of their families or whatever

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,600
because people look at weight in such a

242
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,640
negative way and it's so sad that people

243
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
do that because it's not about it's that

244
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,200
the weight on someone has nothing to do

245
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,040
with their soul who they are as a person

246
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,160
their accomplishments who they who they

247
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,000
are inside and what happens is that you

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,640
know weight is so judged in this world

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,279
right and then to smack on a label like

250
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,160
it's their metabolism they must be

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,440
eating too much and they're not burning

252
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,120
it off or something it's just

253
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
unbelievable when there's bigger reasons

254
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,760
there there's bigger reasons the weight

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
is happening there's bigger reasons

256
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
they're struggling with problems There's

257
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,680
real reasons that science and research

258
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,519
doesn't want to touch or go near because

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,399
it's completely negligent completely

260
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,680
negligent and you know you know how

261
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,600
science of research you know how they

262
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,600
trick you know you know how the whole

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
science thing how it's all all trickery

264
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'll tell you how it's trickery science

265
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,079
is incredible in some areas because of

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,880
technology and where it is today but

267
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,320
then people are suffering with no

268
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,320
answers that's where we are people

269
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,560
suffering with no answers metabolism is

270
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,800
the scientific word somehow still

271
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,480
holding credibility to just throw

272
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,240
everybody off the scent that science of

273
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,279
research has failed everybody in chronic

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
illness so let's go into this a little

275
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,279
bit deeper so we want to go along with

276
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,560
all this yes it's a man it's a manner of

277
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
speaking we can talk about that you have

278
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,560
a slow metabolism we can call it what

279
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,079
you want then but let's let's talk about

280
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,200
the truth of really what it is and

281
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,360
what's happening let's go into there the

282
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
true

283
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,600
cause of what's called a slow metabolism

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,920
is a sluggish liver so the true cause of

285
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,519
a slow metabolism or what we call a slow

286
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,200
metabolism is a sluggish stagnant toxic

287
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:04,200
liver it's that simple a sluggish

288
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,279
stagnant toxic liver that's a metabolic

289
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,880
problem that's your metabolism so

290
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,800
anybody you know anybody including

291
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,720
yourself that may have heard or been

292
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,800
told or diagnosed or anything like that

293
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,560
that they have a slow

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,079
metabolism understand that they have a

295
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,360
liver that's a little tired a little

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,639
toxic a little stagnant A little

297
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,800
sluggish because something is going on

298
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,480
inside that liver and we're going to

299
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,959
explore what those things could be this

300
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,839
could be pesticides and herbicides

301
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,000
fungicides synthetic chemical sitting

302
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,839
inside the liver our livers are filled

303
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,760
with a variety of what I call

304
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,880
troublemakers if you get the Liver

305
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,920
Rescue book if you get the Liver Rescue

306
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,320
book the medical medium Liver Rescue

307
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,760
book and you'll see you know the you'll

308
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,279
see uh it has Xmen psoriasis on the

309
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,160
subtitle and all kinds of it has I talk

310
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,440
about acne on the subtitle and so forth

311
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,360
and you'll see that that's the book to

312
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,120
get so you learn about this I talk about

313
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,120
the

314
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,920
troublemakers and the troublemakers are

315
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,000
all these different things pesticides

316
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,360
were exposed to all the time herbicides

317
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,800
were Expos you know always exposed to

318
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,279
fungicides synthetic chemicals you've

319
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,680
been exposed to those you may not know

320
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:20,160
it but you have I could talk about all

321
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,399
about how viruses that's right we're all

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,760
exposed to viruses we are there's no

323
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,320
question about that Epstein bar being

324
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,680
the number one bacteria Plastics we've

325
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,399
always been EXP OS to Plastics toxic

326
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,079
heavy metals were exposed to Mercury

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,519
were exposed to aluminum lots of it in

328
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,040
our system and in our body it's been

329
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
passed down throughout the generations

330
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,560
into our bodies through our forefathers

331
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,639
ancestry even toxic hormones such as

332
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,120
excess adrenaline from stress when

333
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:57,360
you're stressed out what happens is your

334
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,480
adrenals pump out toxic hormones toxic

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,839
adrenaline that's how we we cope with

336
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,600
stress this stuff is like battery acid

337
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,160
it's corrosive to our bodies corrosive

338
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,320
to our immune system and it fills up in

339
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,880
the liver the liver sponges it all up it

340
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,199
sponges it up have you been to the gas

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,600
station pumping have you ever pumped

342
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,880
your own gas at the gas station before

343
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,040
in your life let me tell you something

344
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,240
all those gas fumes that's a solvent all

345
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,279
you have to do is breathe in gasoline

346
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,440
gasoline fumes all you just have to

347
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,519
whiff it and it's instantly inside your

348
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,760
bloodstream and then being absorbed into

349
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,040
the liver and we do that over and over

350
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,240
and over again pumping our gas and I'm

351
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,839
not saying be afraid of life don't ever

352
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,079
get you know don't ever go and get gas

353
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,959
lean that's not what I'm talking about

354
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,639
I'm talking about the fact that we're

355
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,959
exposed what do we do it clogs up the

356
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:50,720
liver it clogs up it cogs up fat cells

357
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,800
fat cells at the liver stores to protect

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,880
you because we end up eating too much

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,480
fat and so all this fat gets stuck into

360
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,759
the liver and then all these toxins get

361
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
stuck into the fat from our high prot

362
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,480
protein high fat diets so when we eat

363
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,759
the high fat high protein diets which

364
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,079
everybody is still stuck doing science

365
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,920
and research being so Advanced meanwhile

366
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,480
we don't even know what to eat yet it's

367
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,360
incredible the most advanced best

368
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,680
doctor's diets out there and on the

369
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,800
scene and on the circuit and the best

370
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,399
the best kinds of diets out there and

371
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,000
diet plans and different names and all

372
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,360
those different diets and all that

373
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,480
they're still completely void of what

374
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,759
reality is to what our body needs

375
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,680
they're always high fat and high protein

376
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,199
and they slowly bog down our livers and

377
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,800
slowly kill our livers so when you think

378
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,920
about it back to the whole thing back to

379
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,600
the whole thing what I was saying are

380
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,320
you living your best quality of life how

381
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,360
can you with all the misinformation out

382
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
there how can you with the term

383
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,560
metabolism being so backwards and so and

384
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,440
so you know so misinformed or just wrong

385
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,560
how can you live your best of life with

386
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,880
this stuff going on this these are traps

387
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,320
to stop you from living your best life

388
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,920
and your greatest self and your full

389
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,600
potential and your positive self and

390
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,759
everything else and that's how the

391
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,519
world's set up it's set up with this

392
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,639
Darkness out there whether anybody likes

393
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:10,600
it or not it's set up for a reason the

394
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,759
medical world did this they do these

395
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,040
things for a reason they create sand

396
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,600
traps purposely so you get stuck in the

397
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,639
sand traps and it slows down your best

398
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,320
self or best quality of life or what

399
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,040
you're trying to achieve in your life

400
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,800
that's what it does that's what it's for

401
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,920
so you end up for some reason needing

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,399
Pharmaceuticals earlier on in life and

403
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,040
earlier on in life you needed more

404
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,519
Pharmaceuticals and more Pharmaceuticals

405
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,279
you better believe it the troublemakers

406
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,240
these pesticides herbicides these toxic

407
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,440
heavy metals Mercury aluminum synthetic

408
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,880
chemical solvents cleaning agents

409
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,440
cleaning chemicals you know fabric

410
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,880
softeners air fresheners plug in in the

411
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,560
house all those things we absorb into

412
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,079
our livers viruses bacteria Plastics

413
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,319
hormones all of this gets inside our

414
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,079
liver celery

415
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:05,079
juice is one of the

416
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,399
tools one of the tools Spirit brought to

417
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,800
town for me when I was when I was a

418
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,680
child in spirit said look it's going to

419
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,959
be celery juice for people that's going

420
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,199
to be one of their tickets out of the

421
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,800
madness an herb called celery you know

422
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,880
it revives the liver flushes out these

423
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,040
various toxins and helps dissolve and

424
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
disperse the fat cells trapped inside

425
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
the liver from high protein high fat

426
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,279
diets that surround

427
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,639
and contain all of the toxic substances

428
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,519
the troublemakers I talked about

429
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,639
originally just a minute ago essentially

430
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,279
celery juice cleans out the liver

431
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,639
removing a variety of toxins and

432
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,279
reducing viral loads what does that mean

433
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,920
by reducing a viral load like what does

434
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,639
that even mean it's the first time

435
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,720
listening to this and listening to Med

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,519
medical medium podcast and or reading in

437
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,360
any of the medical medium books what

438
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,199
does that mean a viral load is something

439
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,399
like an Epstein bar sitting inside a

440
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,360
liver

441
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,520
proliferating

442
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,520
growing expanding over time to

443
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,240
eventually give you the heart

444
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,839
palpitations The Hot Flashes eventually

445
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,839
give you that per menopause symptom

446
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,199
thing eventually give you reproductive

447
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,000
problems fibroids eventually giving you

448
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,079
all kinds of different cysts ovarian

449
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,360
cysts how about that get chronic fatigue

450
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,959
syndrome fatigue that's what it can do

451
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,280
anxiety depression epine bars just

452
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,480
sitting in there waiting to give you

453
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,440
fibromyalgia your first fibromyalgia

454
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,039
diagnosis when you're age 42 it's there

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,640
waiting to give everybody this it's a

456
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:40,919
viral load it's a virus sitting inside

457
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,120
the liver percolating year after year as

458
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,480
we feed it high protein high fat diets

459
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,320
of all kinds whether it's vegan

460
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,400
plant-based whether it's animal- based

461
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,440
whatever it is and we just feed it the

462
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
wrong Foods we feed it lots of eggs and

463
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,520
these viruses grow so what is a viral

464
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,120
load it's a virus such as Epstein bar or

465
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,039
the shingles or hhv6 or cyto virus or

466
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,400
some many other viruses or

467
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:06,120
HPV even HPV why not sitting inside our

468
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,840
bodies feeding off of the wrong Foods

469
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,400
feeding off the chemicals and poisons

470
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,520
that are trapped inside her liver

471
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,240
percolating proliferating and going to

472
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,120
give you symptoms later on down the road

473
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,600
and all the Geniuses that write the

474
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,159
Books and they're on the circuit and

475
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,679
they're doing the podcast about health

476
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,600
and talking about this diet and that

477
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,799
diet and all the all the all the

478
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,559
brainstormers think about science

479
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,559
studies and science research don't even

480
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,280
know any of this and if they do know a

481
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,880
little bit of this it's because they got

482
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
it and gleaned it from the medical

483
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,640
medium series books or practitioners

484
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,720
that actually use the books or they

485
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,679
heard a podcast of mine and so forth so

486
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,720
this is information you need to know

487
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,360

organ becomes cleaner because that's

501
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,840
what it really is it's not a slow

502
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,919
metabolism your organs are becoming

503
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,679
cleaner your liver is getting cleaner

504
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,200
blood and lymphatic system become

505
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,240
cleaner think about that blood and

506
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,000
lymphatic system become

507
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,640
cleaner unwanted weight gain let's go

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,960
into that a little bit let's go into The

509
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,760
Unwanted weight gain that's

510
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,080
important when someone is gaining

511
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,679
unwanted pounds it means the liver has

512
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,280
been collecting and storing an abundance

513
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,159
of fat cells so why is that happening

514
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,919
you got a tired sluggish liver okay it's

515
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,760
been beaten down by chemicals and and

516
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,320
all kinds of stuff going on you got a

517
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,200
pre fatty liver that's completely

518
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,280
undiagnosed so you got a pre fatty liver

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,039
because there's pre pre pre fatty liver

520
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,159
it's just basically you're just not

521
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,320
getting a diagnosis of a fatty liver but

522
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,200
you're going to someday and if you don't

523
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,320
you're still getting a fatty

524
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,039
liver and then these fat cells collect

525
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,039
they store they collect and they store

526
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,720
and they have poison inside the fat

527
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,760
cells inside the liver and that's when

528
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,760
weight gain starts to show up that's

529
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,400
when it starts to show up it shows up

530
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,559
when the liver's already been filling up

531
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,840
it's already been filling up with these

532
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,000
fat cells you see you guys see the

533
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,520
liver's already been filling up over the

534
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,600
years so if you're one of those where

535
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,880
you're always battling a pound or two l

536
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
pounds on you say you're somebody you're

537
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,760
young you're in the gym and you're

538
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,640
trying to knock off those two pounds

539
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,679
your college weight and then you're

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,440
knocking it off and then it's coming

541
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,840
back on as you're eating your high

542
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,240
protein diets and you're trying to keep

543
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
your low carbs and then you're

544
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,280
exercising and you're breaking it down

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
coming off that means your liver already

546
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,559
filled up with fat if you're getting fat

547
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,679
on the outside of the body it means your

548
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,240
liver already became pre fatty even at a

549
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,840
even at 18 years old 19 years old 20

550
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
years old you already got a pre fatty

551
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,919
liver you already have a problem and

552
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,919
then sure you can say well you know hey

553
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,559
my girlfriend or my boyfriend or

554
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,480
something has he he's got more weight on

555
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,440
him it's a slow he's got a slower

556
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,760
metabolism he exercises in the gym but

557
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,760
he can't keep it off and what happens is

558
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,039
that's just a sluggish a more sluggish

559
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,520
toxic liver with more pollutants inside

560
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,039
the liver including possible viral load

561
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,039
a viral load the very thing I was

562
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,840
talking about earlier right remember the

563
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,520
viral load and then you got that sitting

564
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,840
inside the liver you got the weight

565
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,480
coming

566
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,240
on and then we deem that as slow

567
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,799
metabolism like what a great mistake

568
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,960
that is weight gain is not a result of a

569
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,200
slow metabolism the liver is responsible

570
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,840
for weight issues throughout all parts

571
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,559
of the body so remember that you wake up

572
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,919
one morning you see you see fat on the

573
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,919
body that you don't want there that just

574
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,320
it's the liver it's you got to get the

575
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,720
liver healthy you got to get the Liver

576
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,039
Rescue book the medical me Liver Rescue

577
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,039
book and you got to start taking your

578
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,480
liver seriously because as you go grow

579
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:15,600
older it's not it's not going to it's

580
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,200
not going to go down good people dealing

581
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,440
with weight issues are also often

582
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,640
dealing with lymphatic issues because

583
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,880
when the weight's gaining and the and

584
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,840
the and and the liver getting sluggish

585
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,919
and stagnant and the lymphatic system

586
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,760
gets sluggish and clogged up and it's

587
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,960
harboring an abundance of fat cells in

588
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,039
the lymphatic system because of an

589
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
overloaded liver and then the lymphatic

590
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,760
system gets

591
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,240
overloaded with poisons and toxins

592
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,279
because the liver's so filled up at this

593
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,760
point you know when you're drinking that

594
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,840
celery juice the chemical compounds from

595
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,440
the celery juice enter the digestive

596
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,360
system absorb into the intestinal tract

597
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
walls go up to the hepatic portal vein

598
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,400
and enter the liver they start to

599
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,960
revitalize the liver cell so when you're

600
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,480
drinking that celery juice it's dropping

601
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,400
down through the digestive tract getting

602
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,480
down into the intestinal tract getting

603
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,000
down going up the hepatic portal vein

604
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,640
that's the highway up to the liver

605
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,159
because everything has to go up to the

606
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,600
liver everything it's like a medicinal

607
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,320
infusion for the liver that celery juice

608
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,679
is being driven up into the liver it's

609
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,120
an infusion into the liver to wake it up

610
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,360
to get it out of its stagnancy to get it

611
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,600
out of its to get it out of that whole

612
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,520
stagnant sluggish State that's causing

613
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,679
your

614
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,440
slow metabolism

615
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,279
diagnosis our liver is a filter that

616
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,039
becomes clogged over time if we don't

617
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:42,080
give it relief you have to remember that

618
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,799
our liver is a filter that becomes

619
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,080
clogged over time if we don't give it

620
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,720
help if we don't give it relief it clogs

621
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,880
up over time think about that a little

622
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,400
bit often in addition being clogged up

623
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,880
with fat cells a slow sluggish stagnant

624
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,039
liver is a sign that's loaded up with

625
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,440
toxins and the troublemakers I kept on

626
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,880
talking about earlier these can range

627
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,679
from conventional detergents like I said

628
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,240
colon did you ever smell cologne did it

629
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,679
ever bother you did it it's one of the

630
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,760
things that bothers me probably the most

631
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,760
if I'm in a crowded area going through

632
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,120
an airport or whatever it is the cologne

633
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,080
is so thick it's so toxic it gets into

634
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,279
the sinuses it sticks in there I've had

635
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,799
people tell me for years how it affects

636
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,919
them how it actually gets them like in

637
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,440
instant migraine makes them sick makes

638
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,919
them feel nauseous the amount of cologne

639
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,480
the perfume that's out there because

640
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,720
they're toxic they're chemical they're

641
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,360
chemical agents they're not natural no

642
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,960
one's wearing a natural cologne it's a

643
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,799
chemical company's concoction of garbage

644
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,840
to make a smell occur that for some

645
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,799
reason seems to be pleasing to somebody

646
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,120
but yet not pleasing to most people

647
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,640
that's the irony to it all I mean I mean

648
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,799
I heard you know a friend of mine who's

649
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,600
a health practitioner in a different

650
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,559
realm of Health the different whole

651
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,320
different realm of Health it's a health

652
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
of like chemicals and stuff like that

653
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,799
all that other different stuff and said

654
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,919
that the majority of people when they're

655
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:13,399
interviewed 95 people out of 100 say

656
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,440
they hate the smell of cologne then how

657
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:20,399
is it possible everybody's wearing it if

658
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,520
95 people out of a 100 hate the smell of

659
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:25,320
cologne then then how is it happening

660
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm there's some of these things there's

661
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,640
it's a mystery it's a total mystery

662
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,399
perfumes the same thing there there

663
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,480
there's so many toxic varieties of

664
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:35,720
perfumes and they really affect

665
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,080
sensitive people you know I don't get

666
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,880
affected by Perfume so much but colog

667
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
definitely bother me it's the craziest

668
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,279
thing but I've seen people where they

669
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,000
can't handle any of it and then you got

670
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,679
the gasoline fumes like I talk about

671
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,919
when you're pumping gas air fresheners

672
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,880
air fresheners that's a really bad one

673
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,720
the chemical companies the oil the

674
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,200
vaporized air fresheners the fake

675
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,080
candles the fake candles it's not

676
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,159
essential oils in the candles candles

677
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
when you burn them these are chemical

678
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,159
company Delights these literally

679
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,640
intoxicate us I mean we're talking about

680
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,080
they break down our immune system when

681
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,600
you're burning candles that aren't

682
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,000
natural like essential oils and the wax

683
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,640
isn't you know it's not like a natural

684
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
wax or a soy wax or something like that

685
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,880
where you know whatever it is and it's

686
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,919
just straight chemicals that's really

687
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,279
bad with those candles so many people

688
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,440
what happens is if you're burning

689
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,200
candles for 30 years in your life and

690
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,279
breathing that in you can develop

691
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,080
conditions and diseases and problems

692
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:41,919
because it'll feed pathogens pathogens

693
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,760
inside the body lower the immune system

694
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,120
it could really hurt you it's it's just

695
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,520
as bad as smoking I mean if you're

696
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,720
anti-smoking cigarettes and you think

697
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,399
cigarettes are bad for you just think

698
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,480
about you know just think about the air

699
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,240
fresheners trust me think about the air

700
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,360
fresheners think about those and the

701
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,760
candle whole another game

702
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,559
Pharmaceuticals also get trapped inside

703
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,600
her liver they sit inside her liver

704
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,559
these Pharmaceuticals bacteria and

705
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,960
viruses sit inside our livers forever

706
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,960
where do you think hepatitis C comes

707
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,559
from it's from just a low-grade Epstein

708
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,640
bar virus from be from when you're

709
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,159
younger and it sits in there percolating

710
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,120
causing scar tissue by the time you're

711
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,520
60 years old then the doctor sees you

712
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,880
got a little bit of inflammation in the

713
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,640
liver with a little bit of scar tissue

714
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,360
and he deems it hepatitis C he doesn't

715
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,679
even know that he doesn't even know the

716
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,039
hepatitis C virus or she doesn't even

717
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,279
though the hepatitis C virus is just an

718
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,640
EBV virus that's been in there forever

719
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,000
they never found or singled out a Heep C

720
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,480
virus by the way it's never been singled

721
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,159
out under the microscope ever in history

722
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
they singled out the Epstein bar virus

723
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,360
they never singled out a hepatitis C

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,600
virus isn't it interesting it doesn't

725
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,360
exist but yet it does there is a viral

726
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,320
condition that's sitting inside the

727
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,440
liver and that's what's happening

728
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
there's over 60 varieties of Epstein bar

729
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,840
virus over 60 varieties many of them sit

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,399
inside the liver some of them cause

731
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,840
hepatitis B hepatitis C they cause

732
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,200
conditions inside the liver Scar Tissue

733
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,360
over time from viral inflammation

734
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,919
feeding off of scented candles the new

735
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,000
air fresheners that we're dealing with

736
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,600
to this day to colog and perfumes to

737
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,760
makeups that are really toxic to toxic

738
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,559
heavy metals to you know all these

739
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,279
detergents to solvents to pesticides

740
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,080
herbicides they get clogged inside the

741
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,360
liver the liver loses its ability to

742
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,200
function at its Optimum level celery

743
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,480
juice helps this but it's not just

744
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
celery juice you want to get on the

745
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,880
medical medium you want to get on the

746
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,880
medical medium um the heavy metal detox

747
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,159
smoothie you want to get the heavy metal

748
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,720
detox smoothie you want you want to get

749
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,960
on that vimergy spirina the vimergy

750
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,559
barley crash juice powder you want that

751
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
vimergy right inside the Smoothie you

752
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,519
make the heavy metal detox smoothie with

753
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,240
the wild blueberries I use the the

754
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,880
Wyman's ones you can get another wild

755
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,000
blueberry if you want you just put the

756
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
Frozen wild blueberries in that smoothie

757
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,279
you blend it up I mean that's what I do

758
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,840
to get the metals out because you're

759
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
exposed to Metals we're all exposed to

760
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,880
Metals no matter what we're doing where

761
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,399
we are you want to get them out of the

762
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,120
liver because over time they feed

763
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:23,240
viruses that create liver issues down

764
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,399
the road and never mind slow metabolism

765
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,000
you get that liver too bad and too beat

766
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,360
up and too problematic you're going to

767
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,760
have a lot more problems in slow

768
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,399
metabolism and a little bit of weight

769
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,679
gain you could have a lot more issues

770
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,440
like people have some serious eczema

771
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,519
psoriasis all kinds of different

772
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,519
conditions people have acne acne is a

773
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,279
liver related issue it's stripto coctus

774
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,760
inside the liver and lymphatic system

775
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,519
that's what acne is and you know it's

776
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,000
it's actually unbelievable how people

777
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,760
don't realize what they act they still

778
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,919
don't know what's causing their

779
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,279
acne they don't because there's no

780
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,960
information science of research doesn't

781
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,200
know anything I think it's set up like

782
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,640
that on purpose to be honest listen you

783
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
should read the liver book you should

784
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,279
read Liver Rescue so you actually can

785
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,640
see the difference meaning learn and

786
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,640
then see the difference in the results

787
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,279
when you do the 369 cleanse the liver

788
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,679
rescue 369 cleanse and you actually

789
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,679
start getting your liver back and then

790
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,640
you start getting better there's a big

791
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,240
difference that happens there's

792
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,559
something in celery juice I call sodium

793
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
cluster salts I know some of you guys

794
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,799
already heard about that cuz you got the

795
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,799
celery juice book um the medical medium

796
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,200
celery juice book and the sodium cluster

797
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,760
salts that's a powerful powerful um

798
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,919
phytochemical compound basically what it

799
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,240
does is it helps dissolve poisons that

800
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,760
are trapped it helps to disperse them

801
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,519
out of fat cells it helps to break down

802
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,360
fat cells it helps to get these toxins

803
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,000
these solvents these pesticides these

804
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,559
toxic heavy metals loosened up it helps

805
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,360
to bind on to debris that's caused by

806
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,080
viruses viruses that create debris

807
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,320
byproduct I just want to tell you a

808
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,919
little bit about something about that

809
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,679
byproduct thing so it's important to you

810
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,679
know you guys hear about like

811
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,559
methylation issues like mt hfrg mutation

812
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,639
you hear about that you hear about other

813
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,880
things too and you know then you got

814
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,679
Lyme disease you got um you got bofilm

815
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,039
you hear about that out there right I

816
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,159
mean I'm sure you guys are listening to

817
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,880
all kinds of stuff out there and or

818
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:24,519
reading stuff out there but all that's

819
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,600
caused by viral byproduct and none of

820
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,840
those sources none of those sources or

821
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,000
studies or or practitioners or people on

822
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,039
the circuit even know about any of this

823
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,480
viral byproduct from Epstein bar hhv6

824
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:43,279
hhv7 shingles cyeg virus viral by from

825
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,279
Simplex one Simplex 2 viral byproduct

826
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,600
produced by these viruses inside of all

827
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,840
of us okay that's what causes all of

828
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,440
that that's what causes C reactive

829
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,200
protein test Elevate Ana anti-nuclear

830
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,200
antigen test that's what elevates the

831
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,240
inflammatory tests MTHFR gene mutation

832
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,840
tests that's what actually inflames

833
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,080
everything okay that's homosysteine goes

834
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,200
up that's the whole point it's from

835
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,720
viral byproduct inside people's bodies

836
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,840
that's Advanced information you're only

837
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,519
going to get here from the medical

838
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,039
medium from medical medium radio show

839
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,679
and from the books and that's that's the

840
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,080
whole thing you don't want those viral

841
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,159
loads

842
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,720
increasing and when they increase and

843
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,240
produce all this viral byproduct you get

844
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,360
slower metabolism meaning it could get

845
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,440
diagnosed or seen from the outside by

846
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,039
somebody who doesn't know what they're

847
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,360
talking about about health a

848
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,200
professional that sees it as like a

849
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,240
dietitian that sees it as slow

850
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,880
metabolism meanwhile you're building up

851
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,840
viral byproduct your liver is getting

852
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,440
sicker your weight's coming on you're

853
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,279
getting different symptoms through life

854
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,000
the liver becomes a nesting place for

855
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,039
this these troublemakers and these

856
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,559
viruses these toxins and poisons they

857
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,240
they feed the bugs inside the body the

858
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,320
liver becomes this nesting Place celery

859
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,760
juices sodium cluster salts have these

860
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,039
chemical compounds that bind on to viral

861
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,799
debris and viral byproduct and help

862
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,000
Purge the liver this is so important

863
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,960
this strengthens and awakens the liver's

864
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,519
ability to operate at its best and

865
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,320
perform over 2,000 chemical functions

866
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,840
that are undiscovered by research and

867
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,639
science think about that research and

868
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,799
science has even tapped into a a little

869
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:31,279
bit of what the liver does how it works

870
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,960
that's how it works sodium cluster salts

871
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,799
strip the membrane of pathogens down it

872
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,159
strips the outer membrane of the cell

873
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:40,399
the viral cell that keeps the thing

874
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,240
strong it keeps the virus strong it

875
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,639
strips it down it breaks it down and

876
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,200
then you know that's how it kills these

877
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:50,039
bugs you know and also celery juice

878
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,000
breaks down and helps dissolve the fat

879
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:57,159
cells that are stored inside the liver

880
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,720
so we can pee those fat cells out I was

881
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,840
on the Instagram live recently and I

882
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,080
said piss the fat cells out I probably

883
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,039
shouldn't have said that but it's peeing

884
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,520
the fat cells out okay you know the

885
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,599
bottom line is celery juice is loaded

886
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,760
with vitamins and minerals that

887
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,599
strengthen and feed the liver making it

888
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,119
less stagnant too feeding it are you

889
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,159
feeding your liver the heavy metal detox

890
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,679
smoothie feeds it the medical medium

891
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,960
heavy metal detox smoothie feeds the

892
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,919
liver and you know you do the 28-day

893
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,320
cleanse in the medical medium book one

894
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,200
powerful it save lives long before I

895
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,679
published it long before it was

896
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,560
published the 28 day cleanse brought

897
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,079
people's lives back decades before that

898
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,159
book was even

899
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,200
published okay so that's the power of

900
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,119
these things the the 369 and The Liver

901
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,520
Rescue book and The Liver Rescue

902
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,240
smoothie bring the liver back I mean if

903
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,399
you don't have all the medical medium

904
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,560
series books get them all if you can't

905
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,119
afford the book that mean some of them

906
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,200
are like $10 $9 I saw that uh celery

907
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,000
juice was like $9 or something on Amazon

908
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,880
I know they're in Costco and Target if

909
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,480
you can't afford the book go to the

910
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,160
library take out the whole medical

911
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,200
medium series and start getting your

912
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,920
life

913
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,680
together listen celery juice is a

914
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,280
godsend for The Unwanted pounds when

915
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,920
people just don't want those unwanted

916
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,160
pounds they want them to come off it's a

917
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,359
godsend it really does help but then

918
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,839
when it's unwanted weight

919
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,119
loss unwanted weight loss when you're

920
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:32,400
losing weight when you don't want to

921
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,920
celery juice does the opposite there it

922
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,160
stabilizes the mineral salts bring the

923
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,400
liver back because that's still a liver

924
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,960
issue that's still a liver problem and

925
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,800
it's still an adrenal problem if you're

926
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,920
really

927
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,400
underweight and you don't want to lose

928
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,079
any more weight celery juice can help

929
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,440
you because it assists in that

930
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,480
circumstance too whether you're trying

931
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,880
to gain weight or lose weight it helps

932
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,800
you Hold Steady in between it's a

933
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,440
balancer you know that word balance

934
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,240
right well I got to eat you know

935
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,560
balanced diet I got to be balanced I got

936
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,680
to live more of a balanced life that

937
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,119
word is overused out there or it's used

938
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,720
all the time regardless and that's what

939
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,079
celery juice actually really does it

940
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,839
really does balance things it keeps

941
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,160
things stable stabilizes I love when

942
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,839
something really does work it's another

943
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,480
thing to say the word with all these

944
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,640
so-called balanced diets that aren't

945
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,440
balanced you know and all these balanced

946
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
Lifestyles that aren't balanced at all

947
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,040
that aren't balanced at all like eating

948
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,640
chocolate all day like eating chocolate

949
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,040
all day and coffee all day you know and

950
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,760
and and eating one meal a day and

951
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,079
thinking you're balanced or whatever it

952
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,200
is all these different balanced diets

953
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,520
that are developing left and right are

954
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,880
eating way too much way too much protein

955
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,760
and fat thinking it's balanced or the

956
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,400
whole moderation thing everything in

957
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,240
moderation and moderation that's just

958
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,520
unbelievable it's ridiculous it really

959
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,720
is ridiculous ridiculous I have to be

960
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,640
honest you guys but celery juice

961
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,000
actually does balance things I love when

962
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,200
something actually is it's real and not

963
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,240
just talk it's not just all talk you

964
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,359
know it's critical to know that celery

965
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,079
juice also is not a meal replacement

966
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,680
it's not a meal replacement it's a

967
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,280
medicine it's a medicine it's not a meal

968
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,440
replacement especially if you're

969
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,520
underweight if you're underweight it's a

970
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
medicine so you can actually get to a

971
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,880
point where you're not going to be

972
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,680
underweight anymore meaning what it does

973
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,839
is it fixes the liver it fixes the the

974
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,720
endocrine system it fixes the liver the

975
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,079
endocrine system the

976
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,319
adrenals it it actually gets rid of

977
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,720
viruses that are keeping you underweight

978
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:39,640
because that's the whole thing what

979
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,839
people don't realize who are underweight

980
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,079
and they can't put weight on they're

981
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,200
dealing with a viral load too viruses

982
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:51,359
produce what what happens is viruses

983
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,280
stimulate adrenaline production that's

984
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,920
what they do there's certain varieties

985
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,839
of Epstein bar out of the 60 varieties

986
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,800
of Epstein bar that stimulate adrenaline

987
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,800
production keeping you underweight but

988
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,720
the one thing I've learned about people

989
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,839
who are viral and they're underweight

990
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,520
for a portion of their life eventually

991
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,240
their liver just just craps out the

992
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,440
other Direction and their liver becomes

993
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,359
stagnant and sluggish really heavily the

994
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,200
adrenals get tired and they gain weight

995
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,319
and now they deal with a weight problem

996
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,839
later on anybody who's living

997
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:23,160
underweight where they got this

998
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,359
underweight problem and it's underweight

999
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,200
too it's for years and that person's

1000
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,680
been just they can't keep waiting on it

1001
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,960
changes and they end up with too much

1002
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,839
weight on them and they're on the flip

1003
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,240
side that always happens celeres can

1004
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:38,079
help prevent that too from happening to

1005
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,920
them you can't rely on celery juice as a

1006
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,800
calorie Source though always remember

1007
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,520
that don't skip a morning meal like a

1008
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,240
fruit smoothie or the heavy metal detox

1009
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,240
smoothie or any of the recipes in the

1010
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,119
medical medium series books or you know

1011
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,520
don't skip those just because you know

1012
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,200
you think it's a meal

1013
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,920
replacement it's not so always know that

1014
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,920
have both the celery juice 15 20 minutes

1015
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,640
later enjoy your breakfast after celery

1016
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,720
juice 15 to 20 minutes a half an hour

1017
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,359
later enjoy your breakfast I like I

1018
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,280
personally I like anywhere from 20

1019
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:11,119
minutes to 30 minutes I like 30 minutes

1020
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,280
A Lot the reason celery juice helps with

1021
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,079
both unwanted weight and unwanted weight

1022
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,119
loss is because they both stem from the

1023
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:24,200
struggling liver with the viral issues

1024
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,720
unwanted mystery weight loss is usually

1025
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,599
a result of the low grade viral

1026
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,720
infection like I said the Epstein bar

1027
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,640
inside the liver setting off the body's

1028
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,440
alarm system essentially creating an

1029
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,240
allergic reaction that prompts the

1030
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,960
adrenals to release consistently high

1031
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,920
levels of adrenaline like I was just

1032
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,960
saying earlier the adrenaline acts as an

1033
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,880
amphetamine and that's what happens but

1034
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,880
the unwant The Unwanted weight loss I

1035
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,800
talk about just doesn't last forever

1036
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,839
like I was saying earlier eventually

1037
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,119
liver becomes tired sluggish exhausted

1038
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,720
and then you know the high fat high

1039
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,599
protein diet all that you know going in

1040
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,640
there you know Mass amounts of

1041
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,319
adrenaline saturating inside the liver

1042
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,240
long term because of the low-grade viral

1043
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,720
infection that doctors can't pick off

1044
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,640
that no practitioners can't pick off

1045
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,040
that nobody sees because I try to get

1046
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,800
every Everybody the inside information

1047
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,520
about their body so they can be ahead of

1048
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,280
everything in everyone and when people

1049
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,520
start to gain weight instead it can

1050
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
happen 10 years later 5 years later 4

1051
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,839
years later it can happen 15 years later

1052
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,160
that's how it

1053
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,280
works but celeries use helps out with

1054
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,240
all the viral situations that create

1055
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,520
unwanted weight loss and unwanted weight

1056
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,240
gain because the sodium cluster salts I

1057
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,400
was talking about those chemical

1058
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,720
compounds enter the liver's hepatic

1059
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,480
portal vein and break down viral cell

1060
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,720
membranes which weakens and reduces the

1061
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,480
viral load you want to weaken the viral

1062
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,920
load you want to reduce it you want to

1063
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,119
break it down celery juices compounds

1064
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,319
also grab onto toxins such as heavy

1065
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,119
metals pesticides herbicides fungicides

1066
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,680
solvents that feed viruses and pull them

1067
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,720
out of the liver celery juices compounds

1068
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,760
flow through the rest of the bloodstream

1069
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,839
collecting and disengaging viral toxins

1070
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,400
that are hot I call them hot because

1071
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,040
they're bad they're they're charged

1072
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,240
they're hot charged they actually have a

1073
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,720
frequency they float around in the body

1074
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,359
and what happens is you can

1075
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,760
disengage that frequency you can

1076
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,800
disengage those toxins these are unseen

1077
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
allergic reactions that trigger adrenals

1078
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,280
too we have all these poisons and toxins

1079
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,920
floating around in our body triggering

1080
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,400
off the adrenal adrenals and we're just

1081
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,319
adrenalin flying everywhere people with

1082
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
mystery weight weight loss have a higher

1083
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,560
heart rate too because of this allergic

1084
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,760
reaction of all these poisons and toxins

1085
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,640
floating around the bloodstream and you

1086
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,839
can have that same thing with weight

1087
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,359
with weight gain when you're having

1088
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,040
weight gain too you can have the same

1089
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,760
you know the same toxins floating around

1090
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,280
acting as an allergic reaction mild low

1091
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,680
grade allergic reaction triggering

1092
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,680
prompting the adrenals to release

1093
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,720
adrenaline and this is left over

1094
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,200
adrenaline surging through the body due

1095
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,839
to this allergic reaction from a viral

1096
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,240
load viruses produce poisons and toxins

1097
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,839
by feeding off of poisons and toxins

1098
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,160
these are toxic to our body they float

1099
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,440
around they create low-grade allergic

1100
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,319
reactions prompting adrenaline to flood

1101
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,079
it's Advanced information I mean listen

1109
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,839

1110
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,319
packed with information about gaining

1111
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,760

all of it but it's not just that I talk

1115
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,240
about metabolism I talk about all kinds

1116
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,160
of different symptoms and conditions

1117
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,559
that everybody's walking around with in

1118
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,520
the celery juice book it's it's that

1119
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,000
packed with information I talk about

1120
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,880
what the celery juice does with for our

1121
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,680
liver and and reversing these conditions

1122
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,040
so what I've been doing is giving you

1123
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,000
information right out of medical medium

1124
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,000
celery juice book is what I'm doing and

1125
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,800
because there's that much to share I

1126
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,280
can't even scratch the surface of it

1127
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,200
it's not even possible and so the whole

1128
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,720
thing with with metabolism you know

1129
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,640
that's a big topic all on its own and

1130
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,359
it's important to learn about it because

1131
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,359
what happens is you're going to be told

1132
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,960
one day regardless that your metabolism

1133
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,319

1136
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,880
gym wondering why you can't get weight

1137
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,480
off why a trainer is going to be telling

1138
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,079
you that it's your metabolism or you're

1139
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,160
going to be 20 years old and sick and

1140
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:49,040
fatigued and some doctors's going to say

1141
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,160
you have a slow metabolism or you're

1142
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,040
going to be 45 years old and some

1143
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,079
doctors going to say you got you you got

1144
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,599
menopause and you have a slow metabolism

1145
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,480
that's why you're gaining weight

1146
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,480
whatever it is you're going to be told

1147
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,720
you got a bad metabolism one way or

1148
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,079
another along the way you may as well

1149
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,319
get familiar with how to defend yourself

1150
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,319
see we defend ourselves in all kinds of

1151
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,079
different ways in life right you've

1152
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:14,079
defended yourself right haven't you with

1153
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,200
different things like different things

1154
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,880
you felt weren't just or you felt you're

1155
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,760
being called out on when you have

1156
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,079
then because you weren't doing anything

1157
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,480
wrong I mean did you ever have that in

1158
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,480
life in a relationship or a work

1159
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,359
relationship or just a stranger or

1160
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,720
whatever it is you know what I mean but

1161
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:34,800
we're not allowed to defend ourselves

1162
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,000
with illness with chronic illness like

1163
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,960
we're we're supposed to be sick and have

1164
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,359
to just obey obey these grandfathered

1165
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,839
laws that are set to just ruin our lives

1166
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:50,400
along the way your life is precious

1167
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:53,040
right okay Precious these are your years

1168

your months these are the years of your

1170
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,400
life

1171
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:03,480
you want it taken over by BS like the

1172
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,119
metabolism theory that it's responsible

1173
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,520
for all these things going on in your

1174
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,040
health do you want it taken over by that

1175
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,079
that's the same thing like the protein

1176
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,960
thing I talk about all the time the

1177
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,000
whole thing with protein where protein

1178
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,440
is God are you getting enough protein

1179
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,720
it's all about protein every diet's

1180
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,920
about protein meanwhile everybody's

1181
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
getting plenty of protein but why is

1182
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,160
everybody still sick if you want to be

1183
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,200
if you want your lives eaten up by these

1184
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,160
monsters

1185
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,040
then go ahead but if you don't want your

1186
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,040
lives eaten up and your days wasted and

1187
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,200
your time Wast it if you don't want them

1188
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,920
eaten up you can defend yourself for the

1189
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,480
first time when it comes down in the

1190
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,359

said they never read anything like it in

1255
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,200
their in their life they couldn't

1256
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,119
believe it had almost 200 different

1257
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,160
symptoms and conditions explained to how

1258
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,359

1259
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,960
help heal it they were blown out of

1260
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,800
their mind their minds just were blown

1261
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,720
they they the person shared it with two

1262
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,119
other people already and they were just

1263
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,760

1269
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,480
right to do

1270
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,760
so and you so it's so you just have to

1271
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,720
realize it's about you your health your

1272
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,240
family your friends the people you love

1273
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,839
it's about the people that matter it's

1274
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,680
about your life that matters does your

1275
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:49,839
life matter does it matter at all does

1276
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,559
it you know right it has to right it

1277
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,079
matters to me it matters to me I had

1278
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,319
someone tell me years ago said you know

1279
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,000
my life doesn't even matter it doesn't

1280
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:59,680
even matter I don't even care anymore I

1281
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,319
said you know I do I said I care and it

1282
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,839
matters to me your life matters to me

1283
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,960
and they said you know what you know

1284
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,760
what it turned their life around when

1285
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,359
they heard that because they realized

1286
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,960
that if it mattered to me in every way I

1287
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,960
wanted that person better I wanted them

1288
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,440
recovered I wanted them moving forward

1289
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,240
their life was important and they said

1290
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,520
you know what that changed your life and

1291
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,280
they started applying the information

1292
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,880
they recovered themselves from multiple

1293
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,839
sclerosis that's what they did and

1294
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,000
they're still better today and here now

1295
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:34,640
because of it this was years ago years

1296
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,280
ago years ago and so it should matter to

1297
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,960
you to heal and so when you go back to

1298
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,119
the metabolism Theory it's really a sad

1299
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,680
situation I've seen it used there's

1300
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,760
hundreds of books pamphlets this and

1301
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,400
that about it people still talking about

1302
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,240
it it's literally one of those Devils

1303
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,319
one of those Devils one of those demons

1304
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,799
or something is what it is it takes over

1305
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,640
the mind of millions and millions of

1306
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:05,280
health professionals all around the

1307
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,720
globe you know that are innocent that

1308
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,400
don't realize it they just don't realize

1309
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,319
it and it takes over their Consciousness

1310
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,119
is what it does and it's a seed that

1311
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:18,400
makes it so they can't look further no

1312
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,760
one wants to look further no one wants

1313
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,359
to doubt science's Discovery with the

1314
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,200
metabolism and back to what that is what

1315
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,440
is it it's just a discovery that we're

1316
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,720
actually breathing air we're taking in

1317
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,599
oxygen we're taking in fuel we're going

1318
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,000
to bathroom that's it I'm just letting

1319
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:39,599
you know that's metabolism right there

1320
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,119
you're eating something you're you're

1321
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,960
using it as energy and you're going to

1322
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,200
bathroom you're breathing air which is

1323
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,200
oxygen we're utilizing it and that's the

1324
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,920
discovery basically the bottom line when

1325
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,920
you're dealing with eczema when you're

1326
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,599
dealing with edema and swelling how many

1327
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,319
people are dealing with edema and

1328
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,359
swelling they're dealing with skin

1329
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:01,960
problems like eczema psoriasis they're

1330
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:04,160
dealing with fatigue you know fibroids

1331
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,640
reproductive disorders re reproductive

1332
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,680
problems aches and pains nerve pain

1333
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,200
fibromyalgia which science research has

1334
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,760
no idea about any of these things yet

1335
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,799
the causes you know headaches migraines

1336
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,240
heart palpitations when we're dealing

1337
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:17,839
with lupus that you know with the

1338
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,680
diagnosis of Lupus which is still a

1339
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,720
mystery to research in science think

1340
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,640
about that right there Lyme disease

1341
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,880
still a mystery still a mystery you know

1342
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,559
methylation issues you know everything

1343
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,960
that people go through right now they're

1344
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,920
going through PCOS that one right there

1345
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,680
is really difficult on people and then

1346
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,400
the sibo diagnosis the diagnosis the the

1347
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,079
digestive problems and all that

1348
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:44,880
sinusitis issues vertigo tentis Vitiligo

1349
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,960
lyan sclerosis all of those what happens

1350
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,480
is the bottom line is we have all these

1351
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,799
different conditions and symptoms and

1352
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,040
and diagnoses diseases all of this stuff

1353
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:56,240
science of research is behind the

1354
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,200
eightball and all of it so keep to your

1355
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,880
celery juice keep strong do it long

1356
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,240
enough do it long enough and do enough

1357
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,599
you know when you get the celery juice

1358
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,839
book you'll read the dosages you need

1359
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,960
you try to get on 32 ounces every single

1360
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:13,440
day I got people that are on 64 ounces

1361
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,599

1362
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,799

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,880
away from eggs stay stay away from milk

1366
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,960
cheese butter stay away from kefir stay

1367
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,920
away from yogurt stayed away from yogurt

1368
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,960
stay away from any kind of dairy

1369
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,079
products whatever you do stay away from

1370
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,319
all the dairy of course stay away from

1371
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,160
gluten but you want to know why to stay

1372
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,480
away from gluten cuz no one ever knew

1373
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,880
why no one ever knew why the reason you

1374
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,200
stay away from gluten is so you don't

1375
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,480
feed any bugs like strep octus causing

1376
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,200
acne so the whole reason behind acne is

1377
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,880
Strep bacteria that's behind acne it's

1378
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,200
strep in a sluggish liver and in the in

1379
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,720
a sluggish lymphatic system sitting in

1380
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,720
there causing cystic acne so you want to

1381
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,920
make sure you're doing enough of the

1382
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,640
celery juice you're doing you're staying

1383
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,640
away from the foods you should stay away

1384
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,520
from stay away from bacon stay away from

1385
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,799
pork I would even stay away from corn

1386
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,880
I'd stay away from soy I would stay away

1387
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:16,680
from those too and I would keep your

1388
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,040
animal proteins if you're into animal

1389
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,240
proteins lower them do them once a day

1390
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,200
not twice a day not three times a day if

1391
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,760
you're an intermittent fast faster and

1392
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,200
you like to do animal protein once a day

1393
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,040
at the end of the day do a vegetarian

1394
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,720
meal at the end of the day do a vegan

1395
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,119
meal a plant- paste meal at the end of

1396
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,880
the day one time and then do the animal

1397
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,640
protein on the other day do every other

1398
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,119
day you know if you're if you're

1399
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,680
plant-based if you're vegan lower your

1400
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,880
fats lower your proteins lower the nuts

1401
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,880
and seeds the oils the avocados don't

1402
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,599
have them so high all the tahini I was

1403
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,079
talking to a plant-based person and

1404
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,359
you're a really cool person you're like

1405
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:55,440
you know what I do tons of tahini I do

1406
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,040
two tablespoons of tahini on my salad

1407
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,240
every night I have two avocados in my

1408
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,200
salad I put 2 tablespoons of tahini in

1409
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,839
my salad put a little olive oil in there

1410
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,559
I said oh my God you got so much fat and

1411
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,359
you got so much protein and fat going on

1412
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,960
in there you shouldn't do that you

1413
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:10,280
should have a half an avocado in that

1414
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,079
salad and bring in some red bell peppers

1415
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,799
bring in chop up some celery put in some

1416
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,280
red bell peppers in there lots of

1417
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:18,920
tomatoes I said why don't you put those

1418
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,599
things in there steam if you're not all

1419
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,359
raw steam some vegetables throw in some

1420
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,640
uh throw in some asparagus throw in some

brussels sprouts in there steam them put

1423
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,160
some steamed zucchini in there or make

1424
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,680
some fresh raw zucchini noodles if

1425
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,000
you're into raw do that but whether

1426
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,480
you're plant-based or your animal

1427
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,359
protein lower the fats lower the protein

you can learn all the tips and all the

1432
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,000
things to do including what supplements

1433

bottom line is all of this is really the

1435
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,960
power this these are pieces and tools of

1436
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,880
the power you can use that really clean

1437
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,240
up what you could think is a metabolism
