[9.12 - 14.70] find out what's making you sick and how
[11.00 - 15.92] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[14.70 - 18.20] [Music]
[15.92 - 19.84] medium hello I'm Anthony William you're
[18.20 - 22.68] listening to the medical medium radio
[19.84 - 26.32] show we're talking about fearing celery
[22.68 - 29.08] juice all the fears the the fear that's
[26.32 - 31.88] created out there you know goes along
[29.08 - 34.84] with myths and rumors and rumors and
[31.88 - 35.96] fears and you know it's unbelievable
[34.84 - 38.00] what happens out there so that's what
[35.96 - 39.76] we're talking about really important
[38.00 - 42.04] Advanced information have science and
[39.76 - 44.36] research that's what medical medium
[42.04 - 45.96] shows are about medical medium books
[44.36 - 48.60] medical medium Liver Rescue and the rest
[45.96 - 51.64] of the books and medical medium celery
[48.60 - 55.04] juice that book too make sure you have
[51.64 - 56.80] it it's really a critical one and it's
[55.04 - 58.96] really important actually for so many
[56.80 - 60.92] reasons I mean I can't touch what's in
[58.96 - 62.88] that book and through these radio shows
[60.92 - 64.84] always remember that I know that some
[62.88 - 66.48] people one person said to me hey I could
[64.84 - 69.24] just listen to your radio show I don't
[66.48 - 71.60] need to get your book I'm like okay if
[69.24 - 73.60] that's what you want to do but there's
[71.60 - 75.44] there's the radio shows they can't touch
[73.60 - 77.36] what's in the book tremendous amounts of
[75.44 - 81.16] information Way Beyond what I can do
[77.36 - 84.44] here on the radio shows and um but we're
[81.16 - 86.28] talking about the fears that are created
[84.44 - 88.16] and what that is like what does that
[86.28 - 90.60] mean you'll just hear them over and over
[88.16 - 92.56] again all different kinds out there
[90.60 - 96.16] and I'm just going to cover some because
[92.56 - 97.88] the book has so many of them in there of
[96.16 - 99.80] what you got to look out for what you're
[97.88 - 101.64] hearing out there and all that there's
[99.80 - 102.96] so much of that but I could only cover
[101.64 - 104.60] some and I'm going to cover them right
[102.96 - 105.60] now let's do it let's go straight into
[104.60 - 108.00] it
[105.60 - 111.04] oxalates so what you might see on social
[108.00 - 113.28] media or other places is like acceler
[111.04 - 116.56] juices has oxalates oxalates worry about
[113.28 - 118.48] the oxalate thing oh wo there's so many
[116.56 - 120.68] problems with that one all on its own
[118.48 - 123.48] there is so many issues with that all on
[120.68 - 127.32] its own do not be concerned about
[123.48 - 130.36] oxalate oxyc acid in celery juice the
[127.32 - 132.48] myth that certain leafy green vegetables
[130.36 - 134.48] and herbs such as celery are high in
[132.48 - 137.00] oxalates and therefore harmful is
[134.48 - 140.60] completely misguided when I mean
[137.00 - 144.00] completely misguided oxalates not even
[140.60 - 147.24] barely exist in celery juice this is so
[144.00 - 150.00] important this myth prevents so many
[147.24 - 152.24] people from getting the powerful healing
[150.00 - 155.80] they need it the nutrients the healing
[152.24 - 157.92] properties that foods have and it you
[155.80 - 160.88] know it could provide them with so many
[157.92 - 164.64] nutrients and hearing a myth or a rumor
[160.88 - 166.64] or a fear that really doesn't exist is
[164.64 - 168.48] unbelievable might be well hey wait a
[166.64 - 170.96] minute I'm sensitive to oxalates is it
[168.48 - 172.96] are you you sure you sure that's what
[170.96 - 175.40] you're sensitive when you eat something
[172.96 - 177.56] because it's incredible what happens
[175.40 - 178.76] I've had people tell me that and then
[177.56 - 180.72] they eat something that doesn't have
[178.76 - 182.56] oxalates in it or so-called doesn't have
[180.72 - 184.76] oxalates in it and they're reacting on
[182.56 - 186.00] those but they're not blaming oxalates
[184.76 - 187.56] they're just they're not even blaming
[186.00 - 189.92] the food but they're having bad
[187.56 - 193.04] reactions a bad day a bad day with their
[189.92 - 195.16] Foods a bad problem and this is just a
[193.04 - 197.92] prime example right here oxalates are
[195.16 - 200.64] not the concerned they are even believed
[197.92 - 203.72] to be and that's a whole another issue
[200.64 - 206.24] all and its own now I respect if you're
[203.72 - 207.68] scared about oxalates or you believe
[206.24 - 209.32] because you were told that that's
[207.68 - 211.72] probably why you're having an issue I
[209.32 - 213.36] respect that I totally do and look I'll
[211.72 - 215.44] Stand By Your Side if you need me to do
[213.36 - 218.16] that the one thing I will do is I'll
[215.44 - 220.84] stand with you okay I will and you know
[218.16 - 223.00] I will be a friend about that 100% but
[220.84 - 225.76] don't worry about it in celery juice
[223.00 - 228.04] whatever you do that's one place you
[225.76 - 230.16] should not you you should not worry
[228.04 - 232.28] about it do oxalates exist yeah they
[230.16 - 234.80] exist but they're not what they're made
[232.28 - 238.16] out to be or believe to be you got to
[234.80 - 240.20] remember you guys that chronic illness
[238.16 - 243.00] had this whole succession of De decades
[240.20 - 244.88] before now okay and the Decades of
[243.00 - 247.36] succession were people not knowing what
[244.88 - 248.84] causes disease illness chronic symptoms
[247.36 - 250.60] all the different mystery chronic
[248.84 - 252.32] fatigue all the mystery f moralia
[250.60 - 254.16] everything else you you name it they
[252.32 - 255.64] still don't even know outside of the
[254.16 - 257.40] medical medium books that puts the
[255.64 - 260.24] information out there so you can learn
[257.40 - 262.60] about that but because nobody knew why
[260.24 - 265.32] everybody was sick all these theories
[262.60 - 268.00] popped up over the decades candida
[265.32 - 270.68] candida it's candida meanwhile candida
[268.00 - 273.76] these people are viral and viral sick
[270.68 - 275.08] really bad and I would tell different
[273.76 - 277.88] doctors what are you talking about
[275.08 - 280.16] candida that people are sick like really
[277.88 - 282.68] sick with things like real things real
[280.16 - 284.96] things going on like like other things
[282.68 - 288.00] like strep in their gut eating away at
[284.96 - 289.80] their Linings real things going on and
[288.00 - 292.36] and I talk about all that and this what
[289.80 - 295.20] I mean this is an example oxalates
[292.36 - 296.92] oxalates you pull that out of a hat that
[295.20 - 298.36] rabbit out of your hat because you you
[296.92 - 301.80] know I was going to say rabbit out of
[298.36 - 303.40] something else because you pull that out
[301.80 - 306.36] because you don't know what's caus the
[303.40 - 308.84] Epstein bar that's wreaking havoc giving
[306.36 - 310.80] everybody fatigue and giving everybody
[308.84 - 312.40] neurological problems and and and
[310.80 - 314.32] depression and anxiety and everything
[312.40 - 316.40] else these are the things these are the
[314.32 - 319.76] fears that have cropped up over the
[316.40 - 321.52] years lectin isn't lectin is another one
[319.76 - 324.88] another one that's cropped up that
[321.52 - 326.32] cropped up because still no one knows
[324.88 - 327.44] what's wrong what creates hashimotos
[326.32 - 328.84] thyroiditis and all these other
[327.44 - 330.40] illnesses and everything like this you
[328.84 - 332.24] see what I'm saying
[330.40 - 334.08] this is serious stuff so oxalates is
[332.24 - 336.08] another one just thrown in there okay
[334.08 - 337.68] let's fear oxalates now oh and let's be
[336.08 - 339.40] somebody on social media and say oh
[337.68 - 341.28] oxalates and celerate Juice don't drink
[339.40 - 343.92] it you just basically could have ruined
[341.28 - 347.64] somebody life somebody's life by doing
[343.92 - 349.56] that because what if that person avoids
[347.64 - 352.00] celery juice when it's the one thing
[349.56 - 354.48] that could literally take them out of
[352.00 - 356.04] hell and bring them to Heaven what about
[354.48 - 358.40] that okay take them out of hell and
[356.04 - 360.04] bring them to Paradise how about that
[358.40 - 361.36] bring them to a place where wo you mean
[360.04 - 362.88] I'm actually getting better for the
[361.36 - 364.88] first time in 5 years and I could have
[362.88 - 367.84] listened to that jerk that said there's
[364.88 - 370.40] oxalates in there think about that it
[367.84 - 372.60] it's incredible how it works there are
[370.40 - 374.60] oxalates in every single fruit vegetable
[372.60 - 377.28] on the planet did you know that there's
[374.60 - 380.44] more oxalates in more in every single
[377.28 - 382.96] fruit and vegetable than celery
[380.44 - 385.40] juice but also on the planet there's
[382.96 - 388.12] oxalates on in everything there's
[385.40 - 389.92] oxalates in animal proteins because the
[388.12 - 392.44] animals are eating
[389.92 - 394.92] they're eating plant
[392.44 - 397.72] food so there's oxalates in all the
[394.92 - 399.96] chicken there's o oxalates in all the
[397.72 - 404.04] the the meat there's oxalates in Lamb
[399.96 - 405.96] there's oxalates in all of it because
[404.04 - 407.56] because the oxalates that's in the grass
[405.96 - 408.52] if it's grass-fed the oxalates that are
[407.56 - 411.68] in
[408.52 - 414.36] everything there's oxalates filled in
[411.68 - 416.28] Meats there's oxalates
[414.36 - 418.00] everywhere but of course a piece of
[416.28 - 420.80] fruit's going to be blamed for something
[418.00 - 422.40] of course missing information fruit fear
[420.80 - 424.68] stopping people from living longer
[422.40 - 427.40] that's real great and let's just throw
[424.68 - 429.52] celery in the mix celery juice Now
[427.40 - 431.48] Incredible incred I can't say enough
[429.52 - 433.52] about this one oxalates in a plum for
[431.48 - 435.16] example are much different from those in
[433.52 - 441.28] a piece of
[435.16 - 444.52] cheese okay but there's oxalates in them
[441.28 - 445.92] all this is an underfunded area to begin
[444.52 - 447.28] with the medical research and science
[445.92 - 448.68] cuz guess what there really isn't any
[447.28 - 450.08] medical research and science on the
[448.68 - 452.56] oxalate the
[450.08 - 454.96] that's the whole point you guys that's
[452.56 - 458.44] the whole point and research and science
[454.96 - 462.00] is a theory that can only be funded for
[458.44 - 464.96] a possible outcome always manipulated so
[462.00 - 468.12] the investors of the theory are
[464.96 - 470.28] happy over and over do I have to say
[468.12 - 472.04] this and teach people it's incredible
[470.28 - 475.16] how it works and you're not going to
[472.04 - 477.84] hear this from anybody not one single
[475.16 - 479.32] podcast out there not one single podcast
[477.84 - 481.04] in health is going to say all the things
[479.32 - 483.72] things that I say or different things
[481.04 - 486.28] that I say none of them this is an under
[483.72 - 490.00] underfunded area of medical research and
[486.28 - 492.00] science no so medical communities don't
[490.00 - 494.20] truly know how different forms of
[492.00 - 496.48] oxalates even react react in the body or
[494.20 - 498.44] accum accumulate in the body because
[496.48 - 501.56] there's no way to ever know there's no
[498.44 - 505.04] science in research claims that oxalates
[501.56 - 508.64] should you know create be a problem in
[505.04 - 510.52] celery juice or unproven and OB unstand
[508.64 - 512.40] un
[510.52 - 515.00] unsubstantiated they're
[512.40 - 522.48] unproven and unsubstantiated that's the
[515.00 - 526.20] whole point in reality these Foods Do no
[522.48 - 528.04] harm it's incredible how it works you
[526.20 - 530.16] know rather they provide us with
[528.04 - 534.04] critical healing phytochemicals minerals
[530.16 - 536.60] vitamins and more the vast array of
[534.04 - 540.76] nutrients in
[536.60 - 543.84] socalled spinach meaning High oxalate
[540.76 - 545.84] leafy greens such as spinach are
[543.84 - 550.12] incredible for
[545.84 - 552.32] you Cel are some of the most beneficial
[550.12 - 554.84] to us now if someone says wait a minute
[552.32 - 556.68] Anthony you're wrong because I react
[554.84 - 558.60] when I have spinach or I react when I
[556.68 - 561.12] have something I react in my mouth I
[558.60 - 562.84] feel the oxyc acid causing a problem
[561.12 - 565.40] that's not the oxyc acid you're feeling
[562.84 - 567.88] causing the problem that's an
[565.40 - 571.00] alkaloid that's an
[567.88 - 575.60] alkaloid okay that's what that is not
[571.00 - 578.04] oxyc acid oxyc acid that's false okay
[575.60 - 580.60] true is it's an
[578.04 - 582.20] alkaloid a lot of leafy greens certain
[580.60 - 584.68] types of spinach not all types of
[582.20 - 587.12] spinach will have a higher level of
[584.68 - 589.84] alkaloids something that's not studied
[587.12 - 594.80] something that's completely nobody even
[589.84 - 597.76] knows about really and alkaloids are so
[594.80 - 601.08] detoxifying I mean literally
[597.76 - 603.76] detoxifying and and and and could
[601.08 - 606.76] stimulate the salivary glands all of
[603.76 - 610.36] that and cause a little bit of a stir
[606.76 - 612.24] and people can react a little bit but
[610.36 - 613.20] don't do the spinach then that's okay if
[612.24 - 615.52] you're actually feeling that but if
[613.20 - 617.52] you're not feeling that with things then
[615.52 - 620.44] you should have it regardless oxalates
[617.52 - 623.60] or not whatever it is that's how it
[620.44 - 626.56] works I I know a lot of people lambs
[623.60 - 629.68] quarters I I remember I remember
[626.56 - 631.52] foraging for wild lambs quarters okay
[629.68 - 634.12] and I'm out there I'm looking for wild
[631.52 - 636.48] Lamb's quarters I'm eating them I always
[634.12 - 639.24] did good with Wild Lamb's quarters
[636.48 - 643.64] always did good the alkaloid is really
[639.24 - 646.08] potent but it never bothered me because
[643.64 - 649.48] it's a wild green a lot of
[646.08 - 653.12] spinaches are almost on the Wild Side
[649.48 - 654.68] yes are on the Wild Side practically
[653.12 - 656.56] they are there's a lot of varieties
[654.68 - 658.32] right on the edge of The Wildside
[656.56 - 659.92] they'll have a little higher alkaloid
[658.32 - 662.52] content
[659.92 - 665.12] and I'd be foraging for Lamb's quarters
[662.52 - 667.44] and sea plantain sea plantain is
[665.12 - 670.92] something grows on the shore North
[667.44 - 673.92] America okay and it's kind of like it's
[670.92 - 676.36] kind of like it's uh lot of M
[673.92 - 679.04] muc in it you know I can't say the word
[676.36 - 681.36] right now for some reason but it's it's
[679.04 - 684.96] very like milky when you pluck it at the
[681.36 - 687.60] bottom like milkweed all right and I
[684.96 - 689.80] could eat I could eat the sea plantain
[687.60 - 692.68] that alkaloids off the
[689.80 - 695.80] chart then I went to my friend's Garden
[692.68 - 698.04] who grew lamb quarters grew lamb
[695.80 - 701.32] quarters they weren't wild but it was a
[698.04 - 704.16] different species and basically wild
[701.32 - 707.00] because they were a cultivated lamb
[704.16 - 709.08] quarters but you can't really they were
[707.00 - 711.80] too close to the wild but it eat but it
[709.08 - 713.40] had a stronger alkaloid for some reason
[711.80 - 714.84] it's just the way it works could have
[713.40 - 717.08] been the soil could have been everything
[714.84 - 720.68] in his garden you name it had a stronger
[717.08 - 724.72] alkaloid that thing bit me that thing
[720.68 - 727.60] bit my butt when I ate it I felt it in
[724.72 - 730.12] the mouth and in the throat I was like
[727.60 - 733.40] oh my God I'm having some kind of
[730.12 - 735.88] reaction to this to this lamb quarters
[733.40 - 738.44] when I could eat all the lamb quarters I
[735.88 - 740.00] want you know and the reason what it
[738.44 - 744.20] what it was was the alkaloids were off
[740.00 - 746.76] the chart on that baby not oxyc acid not
[744.20 - 748.56] oxalate but see nobody knows any of this
[746.76 - 750.28] information but that's the whole point
[748.56 - 753.68] nobody knows anything in the alternative
[750.28 - 756.36] movement practically it's all hit Miss
[753.68 - 758.52] guess folklore crap this fake science
[756.36 - 761.64] pseudo science you name it is what it
[758.52 - 764.60] all is you got to remember that most of
[761.64 - 766.12] it so it It's Tricky the whole thing's
[764.60 - 768.00] tricky so you got to be careful what you
[766.12 - 770.28] get sucked into you can get sucked down
[768.00 - 772.80] the road remember I don't work for
[770.28 - 774.76] anybody you always have to remember that
[772.80 - 777.84] I don't work for anybody except for
[774.76 - 781.08] guess what guess who guess who not
[777.84 - 783.24] myself all right yeah I try to survive
[781.08 - 786.44] so I can give you guys as much as I
[783.24 - 789.64] can but I work for you
[786.44 - 792.48] guys it's a difference between working
[789.64 - 794.96] for yourself and everything's about
[792.48 - 797.72] yourself yourself yourself yourself
[794.96 - 799.52] yourself and you just glean up grab onto
[797.72 - 801.12] any information that you can make money
[799.52 - 803.80] off of make money off of make money
[801.12 - 805.80] whatever it is or you work for the
[803.80 - 807.92] people and so you deliver them
[805.80 - 811.04] information that's real for the first
[807.92 - 814.52] time and that's what I do all the time
[811.04 - 817.44] that's how it works so the vast array of
[814.52 - 818.92] of nutrients in so-called High oxalate
[817.44 - 822.68] leafy
[818.92 - 824.76] greens and celery which isn't a high and
[822.68 - 827.52] celery is not a high oxalate anything
[824.76 - 829.52] it's not on a high oxalate of anything
[827.52 - 833.04] they're some of the most beneficial
[829.52 - 834.92] available to us barely there's barely
[833.04 - 837.44] oxalates in so but there's oxalates in
[834.92 - 839.24] everything remember that but barely
[837.44 - 841.00] medical research and science have not
[839.24 - 842.88] yet discovered that fruits and
[841.00 - 846.28] vegetables and leafy greens and herbs
[842.88 - 848.76] contain anti oxalates get this anti
[846.28 - 850.92] oxalates that prevent oxalates from even
[848.76 - 853.20] ever causing an issue
[850.92 - 855.40] whatsoever like the current Trend says
[853.20 - 857.56] that oxalates cause problems because
[855.40 - 861.56] it's never oxalates that are causing the
[857.56 - 862.56] problem it's an alkaloid that's causing
[861.56 - 865.48] the
[862.56 - 869.84] problem it's an
[865.48 - 872.52] alkaloid tobacco is so high in Al alids
[869.84 - 876.00] those tobacco leaves so high in
[872.52 - 879.04] alkaloids really is you got smoke it
[876.00 - 881.68] smoke it smoke it smoke it but you eat
[879.04 - 884.36] that tobacco leaf that alkaloid is going
[881.68 - 885.60] to bite you like NE like no other and
[884.36 - 887.96] it's not going to be
[885.60 - 889.76] oxalates so if you go you go to a place
[887.96 - 892.28] where they grow that they grow that
[889.76 - 893.88] poison where they grow that tobacco leaf
[892.28 - 895.84] and you go there and you pluck a piece
[893.88 - 896.84] and you put that in your mouth you're
[895.84 - 899.48] going to be
[896.84 - 900.96] like what is this reaction I'm having I
[899.48 - 903.24] could smoke the stuff I could smoke
[900.96 - 905.40] three packs of cigarettes a day but I
[903.24 - 907.52] can't this stuff is hard in my mou
[905.40 - 909.04] what's in this my throat it's an
[907.52 - 911.36] alkaloid
[909.04 - 913.28] attack that's what's happening little
[911.36 - 916.96] bit of an alkaloid
[913.28 - 919.48] reaction so yeah I mean Isn't it nice to
[916.96 - 923.24] have some clear information for
[919.48 - 924.52] once oxalates are wides spread whether
[923.24 - 927.60] we like it or
[924.52 - 929.48] not you know so understand that but so
[927.60 - 930.80] are antidotes to oxalates they're
[929.48 - 932.44] naturally in the the fruits and
[930.80 - 935.52] vegetables what they're not naturally in
[932.44 - 937.60] there's no antidotes in meat chicken
[935.52 - 939.84] animal products and people still aren't
[937.60 - 942.64] reacting to those oxalates and there's
[939.84 - 945.64] not even anti oxalates in
[942.64 - 949.28] there that's how harmless oxalates are
[945.64 - 952.68] there's not even antioxidantes built
[949.28 - 955.60] into a piece of meat into an animal's
[952.68 - 958.64] body like there is in all the fruits and
[955.60 - 960.80] vegetables that the animals are eating
[958.64 - 963.72] there's no antioxidants they don't
[960.80 - 965.72] they're not in oxalates in an animal's
[963.72 - 967.52] body meat when you when you're cooking
[965.72 - 969.40] that meat and all that there's no you
[967.52 - 971.24] see but yet those oxalates still aren't
[969.40 - 972.36] bothering anybody when they're eating it
[971.24 - 976.12] they're like okay this CH piece
[972.36 - 978.40] chicken's fine and whatever you see the
[976.12 - 980.88] common belief is that foods high in
[978.40 - 984.16] oxalates produce kidney stones and golf
[980.88 - 987.00] Stones unbelievable protein causes
[984.16 - 990.52] kidney stones and call
[987.00 - 994.08] Stones protein causes kidney stones and
[990.52 - 997.64] gall stones I I could say it again but I
[994.08 - 1001.00] think you got it not an oxalate in
[997.64 - 1003.28] fruits and vegetables so oxalates in
[1001.00 - 1005.76] fruits and vegetables will give you a
[1003.28 - 1008.76] kidney stone celery juice dissolves
[1005.76 - 1011.76] kidney stones lemon water dissolves
[1008.76 - 1014.44] kidney kidney stones um I can go on and
[1011.76 - 1017.20] on and on leafy greens stop the
[1014.44 - 1019.64] production of kidney stones I could go
[1017.20 - 1022.04] on and on and and
[1019.64 - 1025.96] on this is
[1022.04 - 1028.56] unbelievable don't toss out valuable
[1025.96 - 1030.80] healing tools like spinach and celery
[1028.56 - 1033.84] and things like that and celery juice
[1030.80 - 1037.72] for mistaken
[1033.84 - 1039.76] theories for mistaken theories it's so
[1037.72 - 1042.92] important everything I'm talking about
[1039.76 - 1045.56] celan let's go into celan look you might
[1042.92 - 1047.40] you might pronounce celan differently p
[1045.56 - 1052.16] s o r a l
[1047.40 - 1054.64] NS I call them selian sorians you know
[1052.16 - 1057.16] you can call them different things um
[1054.64 - 1060.64] sorians with an S and not even pronounce
[1057.16 - 1063.32] the P or however you want to do borans
[1060.64 - 1065.20] but the bottom line is these right here
[1063.32 - 1067.80] this is going to be this is a constitute
[1065.20 - 1069.92] fear but this is a fear
[1067.80 - 1072.60] Creator that's what this one is so let's
[1069.92 - 1074.88] go into that a little bit it it's an
[1072.60 - 1076.68] ultimate fear tactic that might come out
[1074.88 - 1078.80] that probably already is it's used to
[1076.68 - 1079.84] it's used to deter people from consuming
[1078.80 - 1082.36] celery
[1079.84 - 1084.88] juice sorians are phytochemical
[1082.36 - 1087.24] compounds which reside in almost every
[1084.88 - 1090.28] single fruit and vegetable and Herb how
[1087.24 - 1093.96] do you like that sorians are helpful for
[1090.28 - 1097.08] the immune system and for healing our
[1093.96 - 1100.72] bodies we need that chemical compound
[1097.08 - 1106.12] it's actually critical for us to heal
[1100.72 - 1109.60] yeah any sorians present in celery is
[1106.12 - 1111.56] harmless it's in fact great critical
[1109.60 - 1114.16] that it's even in
[1111.56 - 1117.24] there they do not create Sun
[1114.16 - 1118.32] sensitivities or dermatitis celery juice
[1117.24 - 1121.08] rids
[1118.32 - 1125.48] dermatitis so this fear this fear tactic
[1121.08 - 1128.72] is just amazing to me absolutely amazing
[1125.48 - 1130.44] instead sorians help and rid people of
[1128.72 - 1132.88] these skin
[1130.44 - 1134.72] conditions you got to think about that
[1132.88 - 1137.12] right there how can some of the worst
[1134.72 - 1139.16] cases of eximus psoriasis and it's not
[1137.12 - 1140.84] just recently I I've been doing this for
[1139.16 - 1143.00] decades promoting that celery juice
[1140.84 - 1144.52] since I was a kid 1975 since I was a
[1143.00 - 1147.04] little kid in
[1144.52 - 1148.84] 1975 Spirit gave me that
[1147.04 - 1150.64] information I've watched people get
[1148.84 - 1152.80] their lives turned around because of it
[1150.64 - 1155.48] my whole life when I was a stock boy in
[1152.80 - 1159.52] the grocery store 13 years old 14 years
[1155.48 - 1162.64] old 12 13 14 years old I was actually
[1159.52 - 1166.24] juicing I talk about in the book juicing
[1162.64 - 1169.08] celery there at the store bringing it
[1166.24 - 1170.68] out to people walking around out there
[1169.08 - 1172.64] bringing you know pushing their
[1170.68 - 1174.32] carriages and stuff bringing it out when
[1172.64 - 1177.24] I knew there was a condition and problem
[1174.32 - 1179.00] and everything like that I've seen skin
[1177.24 - 1182.16] conditions better and get better and
[1179.00 - 1184.80] better I've seen that it's it's not it's
[1182.16 - 1186.84] it's it's not something you can't get a
[1184.80 - 1189.96] in Sun sensitivity that's ridiculous
[1186.84 - 1192.32] from from celery juice okay sure you're
[1189.96 - 1194.16] not going to get it from celery juice so
[1192.32 - 1195.72] these are some of the fear tactics that
[1194.16 - 1197.68] you'll see out there if I don't prepare
[1195.72 - 1199.16] you you can't then spread the word
[1197.68 - 1201.60] either
[1199.16 - 1204.32] because I'm only one little guy that's
[1201.60 - 1207.32] it I mean your voice is is what
[1204.32 - 1210.08] matters that's what matters just knowing
[1207.32 - 1212.76] the truth and I know so many people with
[1210.08 - 1215.80] chronic illness they're quiet they're
[1212.76 - 1218.16] quiet they're reserved they're laidback
[1215.80 - 1220.16] and then you got the naysayers out there
[1218.16 - 1222.56] that are just instigating purposely
[1220.16 - 1225.64] they're loud they're squeaky they're
[1222.56 - 1228.52] scratchy they're abrasive they're
[1225.64 - 1229.96] abusive is what they are and you got
[1228.52 - 1231.88] people who are literally trying to live
[1229.96 - 1234.24] their lives they're trying to work dayto
[1231.88 - 1236.88] day or not work work on their health to
[1234.24 - 1238.04] try to get to work someday and they're
[1236.88 - 1239.08] they're you know taking care of
[1238.04 - 1240.24] themselves they're killing themselves to
[1239.08 - 1242.60] take care of themselves of course
[1240.24 - 1244.52] they're working hard at it and they
[1242.60 - 1246.04] don't have time to be squeaky wheels on
[1244.52 - 1248.68] social media and stuff and spread the
[1246.04 - 1250.28] good word and all this kind of thing
[1248.68 - 1254.08] they don't and they stay kind of
[1250.28 - 1255.88] reserved and stay kind ofly back and
[1254.08 - 1257.32] then you there are some people that
[1255.88 - 1259.64] battling chronic illness that are
[1257.32 - 1261.44] Fighters for out there spreading the
[1259.64 - 1263.08] word and if you guys are one of them you
[1261.44 - 1265.24] know spread the word about these very
[1263.08 - 1267.56] things get the book and and read and
[1265.24 - 1270.32] just become an expert get the soues book
[1267.56 - 1271.92] become an expert is really important
[1270.32 - 1273.52] because you'll save lives you don't
[1271.92 - 1276.56] think you'll save lives you'll save
[1273.52 - 1278.32] lives you don't think that matters you
[1276.56 - 1281.96] know saving lives you don't think it
[1278.32 - 1284.24] matters it does it does it matters it
[1281.96 - 1287.16] matters when we're here the good works
[1284.24 - 1289.04] we do matter when we're here we're only
[1287.16 - 1292.44] here for so long
[1289.04 - 1295.12] it matters when we're here it truly does
[1292.44 - 1296.80] every little bit counts let's go to the
[1295.12 - 1300.48] next one so that's
[1296.80 - 1302.04] suran um hey look and prove me wrong
[1300.48 - 1303.56] pronounce it differently and just say
[1302.04 - 1304.96] you could laugh at me I could be totally
[1303.56 - 1306.52] pronouncing it wrong and it's kind of
[1304.96 - 1308.72] funny it's actually really funny you
[1306.52 - 1311.04] know I mean I I'm not an English major
[1308.72 - 1313.64] and I'm certainly not the smartest guy
[1311.04 - 1315.88] in the world my information is smart
[1313.64 - 1317.64] because it comes from Spirit you know I
[1315.88 - 1318.76] don't have any training you guys know
[1317.64 - 1320.20] that
[1318.76 - 1321.72] it comes from Spirits and was a little
[1320.20 - 1324.00] kid it's Advanced Medical information
[1321.72 - 1326.68] filled in these books and it's original
[1324.00 - 1328.56] information because it's no one else's
[1326.68 - 1331.56] there's no citations in the books for a
[1328.56 - 1334.32] reason it's all from Spirit so for a guy
[1331.56 - 1336.96] that's not too smart and writing all
[1334.32 - 1339.80] that down right from just sitting at the
[1336.96 - 1342.16] desk why Spirit talks to me you know
[1339.80 - 1344.76] it's pretty interesting don't you think
[1342.16 - 1346.08] so sorens so that's another way you can
[1344.76 - 1348.72] say it is
[1346.08 - 1352.04] sorens so that's a whole another way
[1348.72 - 1356.36] way and so hey look there you go let's
[1352.04 - 1360.00] go into salici acid
[1356.36 - 1363.28] Sol you know that's a good one okay all
[1360.00 - 1364.60] right that's a good one salicylic acid
[1363.28 - 1366.24] you know everybody's got a different way
[1364.60 - 1368.36] of saying it I think that's the way to
[1366.24 - 1371.60] say that one there tricky words some of
[1368.36 - 1374.04] them you know it doesn't mean hey it it
[1371.60 - 1375.32] doesn't mean if you can't say the word
[1374.04 - 1377.40] right does it mean you don't know what
[1375.32 - 1378.88] you're talking about so always know that
[1377.40 - 1382.36] when you're saying the word somewhere
[1378.88 - 1384.60] it's okay but you know salicylic acid is
[1382.36 - 1388.64] is something that is always been a
[1384.60 - 1390.72] tongue twister and you know basically
[1388.64 - 1394.52] it's got other it's also known as other
[1390.72 - 1397.52] things you know salicylate acid is
[1394.52 - 1400.20] another myth and fear tactic that deters
[1397.52 - 1402.44] people from experiencing the healing
[1400.20 - 1405.28] benefits of celery
[1402.44 - 1407.40] juice so this is another one the theory
[1405.28 - 1410.20] that individuals are sensitive to this
[1407.40 - 1412.24] acid from fruits and vegetables has not
[1410.20 - 1414.56] even been proven by medical research and
[1412.24 - 1418.12] science here's another one here's
[1414.56 - 1420.96] another oxyc acid thing this is another
[1418.12 - 1422.84] mess up in the system how would you even
[1420.96 - 1426.64] know that's what makes you sensitive how
[1422.84 - 1429.84] would you even know in in God's name how
[1426.64 - 1434.20] would you even it would it even be
[1429.84 - 1436.96] possible or in the higher power or in
[1434.20 - 1440.52] the heavens or in the light how would
[1436.96 - 1442.04] you even know no if it was even possible
[1440.52 - 1443.44] that that's what you're reacting to that
[1442.04 - 1444.96] chemical compound in a fruit or
[1443.44 - 1447.68] vegetable is what you're even reacting
[1444.96 - 1449.32] to it's incredible and so they'll throw
[1447.68 - 1450.76] that one at you with the celery juice
[1449.32 - 1453.48] too why not try to stop you from
[1450.76 - 1455.44] drinking celery juice with that one you
[1453.48 - 1458.88] know that's it that's a whole another
[1455.44 - 1461.60] one and so you got to be careful since
[1458.88 - 1464.88] celery is not a vegetable it shouldn't
[1461.60 - 1468.84] even be grouped in this Theory anyway
[1464.88 - 1473.72] this is a vegetable Theory you guys
[1468.84 - 1477.36] salic cylic acid is a vegetable Theory
[1473.72 - 1480.20] it's an actual vegetable Theory it's not
[1477.36 - 1483.28] a herb Theory it's not even an herb
[1480.20 - 1487.88] Theory celery is an
[1483.28 - 1490.84] herb I mean the amount of bull bleep
[1487.88 - 1493.76] that we got to sift through here it's
[1490.84 - 1495.92] daunting and it shows you how even the
[1493.76 - 1498.92] top so-called experts out there know
[1495.92 - 1501.68] nothing about celery juice nor People's
[1498.92 - 1504.32] Health in general it's actually kind of
[1501.68 - 1505.84] like sad and scary at the same time when
[1504.32 - 1507.96] you really think about
[1505.84 - 1510.40] it it's
[1507.96 - 1511.84] incredible so since celery isn't even a
[1510.40 - 1514.04] vegetable it's not even it shouldn't
[1511.84 - 1516.40] even be grouped in this Theory anyway
[1514.04 - 1520.40] celery juice is in herbal medicine that
[1516.40 - 1523.12] helps reverse chemical food
[1520.40 - 1528.20] sensitivities that many people develop
[1523.12 - 1531.36] from gluten dairy corn eggs and soy
[1528.20 - 1532.76] celery juice is an herbal medicine that
[1531.36 - 1537.04] helps
[1532.76 - 1538.72] reverse ready chemical food
[1537.04 - 1541.04] sensitivities chemical food
[1538.72 - 1542.96] sensitivities that many people develop
[1541.04 - 1545.56] because of eating all this gluten all
[1542.96 - 1547.64] this Dairy all this corn all this eggs
[1545.56 - 1549.24] and all these soy and all the soy that
[1547.64 - 1551.96] feeds

[1555.40 - 1560.44] Simplex 2 virus all the different
[1556.96 - 1564.44] mutations of all these viruses hhv7 many
[1560.44 - 1567.04] other ones strep staff ciff MCA boom
[1564.44 - 1569.20] whatever all these things and then some
[1567.04 - 1572.96] just more bacteria than that just tons
[1569.20 - 1576.00] of bacteria all of this
[1572.96 - 1578.40] well eggs feed that they feed all those
[1576.00 - 1580.52] little bugs eat your eggs eat your eggs
[1578.40 - 1583.08] happy happy feed the bugs eat you know
[1580.52 - 1585.24] and that's what it is well celery juice
[1583.08 - 1587.00] helps combat not only the pathogens that
[1585.24 - 1588.64] cause food sensitivities and all these
[1587.00 - 1590.44] other issues in everything
[1588.64 - 1593.40] else
[1590.44 - 1596.12] but it's it's it's anti all this it's
[1593.40 - 1597.76] it's incredible okay let's go
[1596.12 - 1600.52] into
[1597.76 - 1603.44] sodium let's hit sodium this is a fun
[1600.52 - 1604.68] one this one is is my favorite is
[1603.44 - 1608.16] actually my
[1604.68 - 1609.44] favorite the same okay you got to get
[1608.16 - 1612.24] ready for
[1609.44 - 1613.84] this the same dietitians nutritionist
[1612.24 - 1616.08] so-called experts blah blah blah
[1613.84 - 1617.80] everybody else the same ones will
[1616.08 - 1620.72] literally tell you there's too much salt
[1617.80 - 1624.68] and celery juice but they'll advise all
[1620.72 - 1626.36] their patients clients all their people
[1624.68 - 1628.44] all their whatever it is they're writing
[1626.36 - 1632.44] or doing they'll advise them to stick
[1628.44 - 1633.24] salt in water and drink it that's what
[1632.44 - 1637.28] they'll
[1633.24 - 1639.08] do irony I irony is not even a word I
[1637.28 - 1641.88] could use for this because you have to
[1639.08 - 1643.80] attach irony with stupidity with with
[1641.88 - 1645.20] just plain old something with plain old
[1643.80 - 1646.92] ignorance with something else with
[1645.20 - 1649.20] something else with something else and
[1646.92 - 1651.92] you have to lump them all together so
[1649.20 - 1656.16] irony can't work I can't use irony for
[1651.92 - 1659.60] this one because I know for a
[1656.16 - 1662.36] fact that virtually probably almost
[1659.60 - 1667.08] every single naysayer against the sodium
[1662.36 - 1669.20] and celery juice almost every single
[1667.08 - 1671.76] naysayer
[1669.20 - 1674.68] allows a little pinch of sea salt in
[1671.76 - 1676.84] your water because it's another once
[1674.68 - 1678.76] again no science behind it no anything
[1676.84 - 1680.76] behind it no nothing behind it once
[1678.76 - 1685.12] again it became law and where did it
[1680.76 - 1691.44] come from who the hell knows and it's
[1685.12 - 1694.12] junk what it does is the salt in celery
[1691.44 - 1697.84] juice hydrates
[1694.12 - 1699.52] you the salt thrown in a glass of water
[1697.84 - 1702.32] dehydrates
[1699.52 - 1704.56] you dehydrates
[1702.32 - 1708.80] you so that's the
[1704.56 - 1712.00] difference the salt in celery
[1708.80 - 1715.00] are are subgroups of
[1712.00 - 1717.28] sodium ones that go to the
[1715.00 - 1719.96] brain to restore damaged
[1717.28 - 1721.48] neurotransmitter chemicals to fire up
[1719.96 - 1724.28] electrical
[1721.48 - 1725.28] impulses to help you heal on almost
[1724.28 - 1728.80] every
[1725.28 - 1731.88] level those are the salts that your body
[1728.80 - 1734.44] craves the mineral salts that your body
[1731.88 - 1736.40] craves that's your bloodstream craves
[1734.44 - 1740.64] it's your organs
[1736.40 - 1743.12] crave sea salt can dehydrate you you
[1740.64 - 1745.32] have to be careful it's not the same
[1743.12 - 1748.32] thing from an
[1745.32 - 1752.88] herb that's from the
[1748.32 - 1756.48] ocean that's not from an herbal
[1752.88 - 1759.96] food now if you can excuse me if you can
[1756.48 - 1765.08] walk up to the ocean right up to the
[1759.96 - 1768.16] beach and you can just you know drink of
[1765.08 - 1772.04] that salt water right there just scoop
[1768.16 - 1774.00] and just drink it and that would be fine
[1772.04 - 1775.44] and I would start to believe you or
[1774.00 - 1778.52] believe them the
[1775.44 - 1782.56] naysayers the reason why guys died at
[1778.52 - 1785.28] Sea was because they drank that salt
[1782.56 - 1790.00] water the other reason why they died at
[1785.28 - 1791.92] C they had no vitamin C cuz vitamin C
[1790.00 - 1795.20] stops you from
[1791.92 - 1798.20] dying guess what's in celery
[1795.20 - 1800.40] juice an unbelievable variety of vitamin
[1798.20 - 1802.76] C undiscovered by research and
[1800.40 - 1804.24] science that's what's in celery juice
[1802.76 - 1806.36] we're going to talk about that another
[1804.24 - 1809.84] day we're going to go
[1806.36 - 1812.72] into the whole salt thing now we're not
[1809.84 - 1814.96] a low salt Society we're a high salt
[1812.72 - 1816.88] Society I'm okay with a little pinch of
[1814.96 - 1818.72] salt if you want it on some food to
[1816.88 - 1821.32] flavor it a really good sea salt a
[1818.72 - 1825.08] really good Himalayan rock salt I'm not
[1821.32 - 1828.00] anti I mean I'm not anti a little flavor
[1825.08 - 1832.40] in somebody's life here and there
[1828.00 - 1835.56] okay but I'm anti someone ripping a hole
[1832.40 - 1839.08] in celery over its
[1835.56 - 1842.04] sodium when if guys that see that were
[1839.08 - 1845.24] out of water were drinking celery juice
[1842.04 - 1848.36] that whole trip they'd be not only in a
[1845.24 - 1850.40] incredible condition the sodium would
[1848.36 - 1853.28] never dehydrate them it would do the
[1850.40 - 1854.52] opposite it would keep them hydrated on
[1853.28 - 1856.60] a deep
[1854.52 - 1858.84] level and that's what we're talking
[1856.60 - 1860.60] about that's the differences but
[1858.84 - 1862.12] remember the naysayers has too much salt
[1860.60 - 1863.92] in it and they pass out that information
[1862.12 - 1866.72] out there the so-called professionals I
[1863.92 - 1868.96] mean can you believe it I don't want
[1866.72 - 1872.32] listen I have respect for anybody with
[1868.96 - 1875.08] credentials I do because it's not who
[1872.32 - 1878.96] they are as a
[1875.08 - 1881.48] person okay and I'm proud of anyone who
[1878.96 - 1883.56] goes to school I'm proud of anybody who
[1881.48 - 1886.04] goes to school and they get all the
[1883.56 - 1887.84] different letters behind their name I'm
[1886.04 - 1890.04] actually proud of them I feel like it's
[1887.84 - 1891.72] a serious accomplishment I'm proud of
[1890.04 - 1894.64] people I'm also proud of people who
[1891.72 - 1896.24] don't do that because they're doing
[1894.64 - 1899.68] other things in their
[1896.24 - 1901.16] life you see you see but I notice though
[1899.68 - 1903.92] you know you can have all the letters
[1901.16 - 1905.76] behind your name you want all the
[1903.92 - 1907.44] letters but if you're sitting there
[1905.76 - 1909.24] saying there's too much salt and celery
[1907.44 - 1910.92] juice so and look out and you're you're
[1909.24 - 1913.56] advising your people
[1910.92 - 1916.16] that you know those letters they just
[1913.56 - 1918.24] become they're they're empty they're
[1916.16 - 1919.92] empty and you want your letters to
[1918.24 - 1921.28] matter at the end of your you know at
[1919.92 - 1923.40] the end of your name if that's what you
[1921.28 - 1926.20] seek in life so anyone who's got
[1923.40 - 1927.92] credentials which I'm a big time Big
[1926.20 - 1929.28] Time respect for all doctors and friends
[1927.92 - 1931.16] I have and everybody else all the
[1929.28 - 1932.24] different credentials that people have
[1931.16 - 1934.72] make them
[1932.24 - 1937.08] count make the make those letters at the
[1934.72 - 1939.56] end of your name count and not tell
[1937.08 - 1942.56] somebody hey avoid celery because you
[1939.56 - 1944.20] know because it's got salt in it you
[1942.56 - 1946.08] know that's that's that's that's just
[1944.20 - 1948.52] not going to work
[1946.08 - 1950.68] because if you keep on doing things like
[1948.52 - 1953.00] that your letters they just become like
[1950.68 - 1954.64] they're hollowed out make them Rich make
[1953.00 - 1957.04] those letters after your name rich like
[1954.64 - 1959.24] the work you did to get them so and
[1957.04 - 1960.88] doing that is taking information that's
[1959.24 - 1964.08] powerful that can change lives and
[1960.88 - 1966.40] reverse people's conditions and and
[1964.08 - 1971.76] change your lives and don't make them
[1966.40 - 1973.72] fear fear fear fear fear celery juice
[1971.76 - 1975.60] unbelievable but yet make sure they
[1973.72 - 1977.16] throw pinches of sea salt in their water
[1975.60 - 1979.44] all the time after they did a workout
[1977.16 - 1982.04] out which is utterly
[1979.44 - 1984.32] ridiculous you want celery juice after a
[1982.04 - 1985.92] workout so we're going we're in sodium
[1984.32 - 1987.52] this sodium one's that important that's
[1985.92 - 1991.64] why I'm going into
[1987.52 - 1994.72] this so look we're inundated with salt
[1991.64 - 1997.52] in our daily life we just are you can't
[1994.72 - 2001.08] run from it while there are people who
[1997.52 - 2002.76] are mindful about it they're a minority
[2001.08 - 2004.32] the people who are actually mind that
[2002.76 - 2007.08] are mindful about this their salt
[2004.32 - 2009.16] consumption is a really it's a minority
[2007.08 - 2013.16] it's you guys got to know how small it
[2009.16 - 2015.24] is it's such a small crew of people it's
[2013.16 - 2018.36] ridiculous even the people that are
[2015.24 - 2019.88] mindful about it doesn't mean they even
[2018.36 - 2024.48] like it hear
[2019.88 - 2029.16] it so the majority of restaurants rely
[2024.48 - 2030.80] on salt because if they don't I mean the
[2029.16 - 2033.44] the majority you know what all
[2030.80 - 2035.32] restaurants rely on salt they just do
[2033.44 - 2037.48] I'm sorry I mean you could ask for salt
[2035.32 - 2038.96] not to put salt in something at a
[2037.48 - 2040.88] restaurant whether it's vegan
[2038.96 - 2042.24] plant-based kop keto whatever kind of
[2040.88 - 2046.52] restaurant that pops up out of the
[2042.24 - 2048.04] garden the point is is would it relies
[2046.52 - 2050.48] on salt because it's never going to get
[2048.04 - 2053.40] a repeat customer if it serves bland
[2050.48 - 2054.92] food unless this minority who truly
[2053.40 - 2056.92] wants to be salt-free and they know the
[2054.92 - 2058.16] flavors are tasting without the salt you
[2056.92 - 2060.32] know walks through the door but that's
[2058.16 - 2062.96] not going to keep a restaurant alive I
[2060.32 - 2064.92] don't know who that one person is that's
[2062.96 - 2068.28] going to walk into a restaurant and keep
[2064.92 - 2070.76] that restaurant alive because it's
[2068.28 - 2073.60] rare the the majority of restaurants
[2070.76 - 2075.88] they're all on salt for a reason if you
[2073.60 - 2078.96] like if you had never eaten food with
[2075.88 - 2082.00] added salt then went out to eat or tried
[2078.96 - 2084.36] a package snack you would be staggered
[2082.00 - 2086.12] by the overpowering nature of of the
[2084.36 - 2088.64] salt itself we put in food so if you
[2086.12 - 2091.60] were born and you were raised and your
[2088.64 - 2093.00] mom and your dad your mother and father
[2091.60 - 2094.56] they were like hey we're just going to
[2093.00 - 2096.64] keep salt out of the diet we're just
[2094.56 - 2099.52] going to do celery juice and this and
[2096.64 - 2102.68] that and and spinach spinach is salty
[2099.52 - 2105.12] spinach is very salty in a healthy way
[2102.68 - 2108.96] too and there's all these other lemon
[2105.12 - 2110.48] has sodium in it lemon so and you're
[2108.96 - 2113.32] getting all these salts from all these
[2110.48 - 2114.88] other foods and then you go out and eat
[2113.32 - 2116.24] you know you're now a teenager and you
[2114.88 - 2119.04] eat in a restaurant for the first time
[2116.24 - 2121.40] in your life you would literally be
[2119.04 - 2123.00] blown off your seat and probably
[2121.40 - 2125.80] consider it's
[2123.00 - 2129.52] poison probably consider it's
[2125.80 - 2133.76] poison but we're trained we're
[2129.52 - 2139.16] brainwashed and trained to consume
[2133.76 - 2143.68] sodium and then our senses our senses
[2139.16 - 2145.72] okay in our brain they adapt to it and
[2143.68 - 2148.52] then they require it or not required for
[2145.72 - 2150.64] a healthy reason but for
[2148.52 - 2152.04] happiness and that's how it works I mean
[2150.64 - 2155.76] that's just a part of
[2152.04 - 2158.28] it so where does all the salt we eat go
[2155.76 - 2160.84] does it just go flow right out of our
[2158.28 - 2162.84] body so easily as it's entered no it
[2160.84 - 2166.36] doesn't some of it
[2162.84 - 2170.20] does even the most premium salt from a
[2166.36 - 2172.40] jar of organic salsa or the healthiest
[2170.20 - 2177.16] kitschiest dehydrated
[2172.40 - 2180.16] crackers or salted nut mix stores even
[2177.16 - 2181.16] those even those okay a salted nut mix
[2180.16 - 2185.00] that's really
[2181.16 - 2188.80] healthy that salt will store itself in
[2185.00 - 2191.80] cells deep inside the organs and
[2188.80 - 2195.64] crystallize there it'll crystallize we
[2191.80 - 2198.44] slowly salt ourselves to death
[2195.64 - 2200.24] culture and this crystallization of salt
[2198.44 - 2203.04] builds up inside
[2200.24 - 2205.72] organs until they're pickled until
[2203.04 - 2209.52] they're preserved in a bad
[2205.72 - 2212.08] way I mean it takes decades but it
[2209.52 - 2214.76] happens and your skin starts getting
[2212.08 - 2217.08] weird and you start getting
[2214.76 - 2219.68] older and then somebody say well I don't
[2217.08 - 2221.16] know why I'm I'm I'm aging too fast with
[2219.68 - 2222.44] my skin and everything else someone's
[2221.16 - 2225.68] going to say you need
[2222.44 - 2228.28] collagen you need you need collagen
[2225.68 - 2230.24] unbelievable and that's not what it is
[2228.28 - 2232.24] it's because someone has a lifetime of
[2230.24 - 2234.40] salt crystallization build up in their
[2232.24 - 2237.28] liver and other
[2234.40 - 2239.32] organs and they're literally getting
[2237.28 - 2240.60] dehydrated on levels you can't even
[2239.32 - 2244.92] speak
[2240.60 - 2247.80] about look the bottom line is salt
[2244.92 - 2250.40] particularly in beds itself inside your
[2247.80 - 2252.44] liver because your liver tries to gather
[2250.40 - 2255.56] it up from your bloodstream to protect
[2252.44 - 2257.96] you from falling ill because we overuse
[2255.56 - 2261.12] the overuse of salt which is part of
[2257.96 - 2266.52] nearly everyone's everyday
[2261.12 - 2270.24] life okay there in the liver salt sticks
[2266.52 - 2272.56] around for years sound it like salt
[2270.24 - 2275.08] sticks is there you know like a salt
[2272.56 - 2279.68] like a salt stick salt sticks around in
[2275.08 - 2279.68] the liver for years and becomes
[2279.92 - 2285.24] toxic that's how it works if we're not
[2282.28 - 2287.84] cleansing it out someone who worried
[2285.24 - 2289.96] about their salt and celery should
[2287.84 - 2291.28] instead be worried about the onslaught
[2289.96 - 2292.60] of salt they've had throughout their
[2291.28 - 2294.40] whole life and in package food and
[2292.60 - 2296.96] everything packaged healthy food and in
[2294.40 - 2299.72] restaurants and dishes and everything
[2296.96 - 2301.68] else you know that's what they should be
[2299.72 - 2304.24] worried about the sodium and celery
[2301.68 - 2306.20] juice is a reprieve from all that and it
[2304.24 - 2307.84] does even one thing nobody even knows
[2306.20 - 2309.72] about this is a huge thing and I talk
[2307.84 - 2311.24] about it in medical medium celery juice
[2309.72 - 2314.00] you guys need to know how important this
[2311.24 - 2317.40] is it provides sodium that not only
[2314.00 - 2319.28] doesn't harm us but it helps us when
[2317.40 - 2322.20] people are concerned about celery juice
[2319.28 - 2324.88] and sodium what they are really saying
[2322.20 - 2326.48] is they don't understand celery or
[2324.88 - 2330.24] celery
[2326.48 - 2334.48] juice so think about that one it's a
[2330.24 - 2336.68] blind absum a blind absum with no
[2334.48 - 2340.08] research in science to back it up when
[2336.68 - 2343.12] they say that in truth the sodium in
[2340.08 - 2345.64] celery juice helps loosen up and break
[2343.12 - 2347.44] apart toxic old sodium deposits that are
[2345.64 - 2351.36] crystallized in the liver and elsewhere
[2347.44 - 2353.44] in the body and freeing you from
[2351.36 - 2356.20] possible problems down the road because
[2353.44 - 2359.40] the sodium and celery is different
[2356.20 - 2362.00] celery juices sodium contains sodium
[2359.40 - 2364.96] cluster salts subgroup of sodium it's
[2362.00 - 2367.16] the only thing that does it helps Drive
[2364.96 - 2369.44] toxic sodium deposits out of the body by
[2367.16 - 2372.28] attaching themselves to the toxic sodium
[2369.44 - 2375.76] and carrying it
[2372.28 - 2379.12] out further the sodium and celery juice
[2375.76 - 2383.28] is what our blood needs the most and can
[2379.12 - 2385.76] use the most the most neurotransmitters
[2383.28 - 2388.64] in our brain thrive on this variety of
[2385.76 - 2391.36] sodium which has just the right minerals
[2388.64 - 2395.28] and trace minerals attached to
[2391.36 - 2398.56] it rather than contains neurotransmitter
[2395.28 - 2400.76] chemical building block box you see
[2398.56 - 2402.92] see here's how it works okay let me
[2400.76 - 2406.52] clarify that last part that might sound
[2402.92 - 2408.00] confusing and if you're if this is a a
[2406.52 - 2409.72] live podcast meaning that you're
[2408.00 - 2412.72] listening to like live right now in the
[2409.72 - 2415.60] moment with me afterwards try to do the
[2412.72 - 2418.76] replay or whatever down the road in case
[2415.60 - 2421.60] right on this part this is important
[2418.76 - 2424.76] so what celer juuse does is it doesn't
[2421.60 - 2426.80] contain the building blocks to
[2424.76 - 2430.40] neurotransmitters it does better than
[2426.80 - 2432.36] that you see somebody's vitamin water
[2430.40 - 2435.08] with electrolytes somebody's electrolyte
[2432.36 - 2436.72] thing somebody's even incredible water
[2435.08 - 2438.36] they're drinking like the water I like
[2436.72 - 2440.92] and stuff that I drink that you guys
[2438.36 - 2443.84] prob maybe see me with here and there
[2440.92 - 2445.28] like all these different things you know
[2443.84 - 2446.84] I'm not sponsored by any companies or
[2445.28 - 2449.36] anything or nothing like that and I
[2446.84 - 2453.92] still say Brands all the time to you
[2449.36 - 2455.00] guys but the thing is is with water
[2453.92 - 2456.56] there could be these amazing
[2455.00 - 2460.00] electrolytes naturally occurring in
[2456.56 - 2463.16] there but they're just building
[2460.00 - 2466.04] blocks you get some from there some from
[2463.16 - 2468.64] the salad you just ate some from the
[2466.04 - 2470.48] other uh fruit that you ate some from
[2468.64 - 2473.00] the Apple you just ate some from all
[2470.48 - 2477.68] these different things that you're doing
[2473.00 - 2480.72] in your life you get all these pieces of
[2477.68 - 2482.88] electroly building blocks all these
[2480.72 - 2483.96] pieces of neurotransmitter chemical
[2482.88 - 2487.04] building
[2483.96 - 2490.44] blocks there's only one thing on the
[2487.04 - 2493.00] planet that gives you the full
[2490.44 - 2494.12] thing that's why people have Clarity get
[2493.00 - 2495.24] the rid of their brain fog all these
[2494.12 - 2496.96] other things start happening their life
[2495.24 - 2498.72] starts changing anxiety starts dropping
[2496.96 - 2501.44] their depression starts getting better I
[2498.72 - 2503.84] talk about this in medical medium celery
[2501.44 - 2504.88] juice you got to get the book you have
[2503.84 - 2507.00] to get the
[2504.88 - 2511.04] book you have
[2507.00 - 2514.04] to and the thing is this is what I'm
[2511.04 - 2518.32] trying to tell you is the celery juice
[2514.04 - 2519.88] has the complete electroly like complete
[2518.32 - 2522.40] so the neurotransmitter chemical can
[2519.88 - 2523.88] revive itself not just a building block
[2522.40 - 2525.28] like a little bit in this water a little
[2523.88 - 2526.84] bit in this thing you eat a little bit
[2525.28 - 2528.48] in this then you're going through the de
[2526.84 - 2531.40] day and you're trying to collect pieces
[2528.48 - 2535.44] you're trying to collect them minerals
[2531.40 - 2537.16] that find their way to neurons by chance
[2535.44 - 2538.72] when you're just collecting them like
[2537.16 - 2541.36] that they're just minerals that are
[2538.72 - 2542.96] finding their way to neurons by chance
[2541.36 - 2544.44] depending on what someone's eating or
[2542.96 - 2545.48] drinking what water they're drinking
[2544.44 - 2548.04] what what they're eating what they're
[2545.48 - 2551.36] doing think about that celery juice is
[2548.04 - 2554.64] the only food on the planet to offer
[2551.36 - 2556.92] complete activated
[2554.64 - 2558.36] electrolytes even with coconut water you
[2556.92 - 2560.04] don't get complete see that's what I'm
[2558.36 - 2561.32] trying to say if you had coconut water
[2560.04 - 2563.20] last week you got a couple of the
[2561.32 - 2565.08] building blocks to your neurotransmitter
[2563.20 - 2567.80] chemicals and if you had some good high
[2565.08 - 2569.64] quality water like Fiji or something you
[2567.80 - 2571.60] got you know there you go you got
[2569.64 - 2574.60] another one when you're out there or if
[2571.60 - 2577.56] you did this or whatever and you get the
[2574.60 - 2580.20] building blocks but coconut water isn't
[2577.56 - 2583.00] a complete it's not a complete it's just
[2580.20 - 2584.52] pieces of them celery juice is complete
[2583.00 - 2587.60] that's why you have to drink it every
[2584.52 - 2589.32] single day it offers a complete
[2587.60 - 2591.68] neurotransmitter chemical that are
[2589.32 - 2594.00] already bonded together to reignite
[2591.68 - 2595.88] weaken
[2594.00 - 2599.64] neurotransmitters
[2595.88 - 2602.52] after and and and it offers the ultimate
[2599.64 - 2604.64] neuron relief our neurons in our brain
[2602.52 - 2607.84] this gives our them our you know
[2604.64 - 2611.00] ultimate neuron relief
[2607.84 - 2612.60] when electricity flows it can flow more
[2611.00 - 2617.28] freely through a
[2612.60 - 2619.12] neuron with neurotransmitter chemicals
[2617.28 - 2622.24] restored by the complete
[2619.12 - 2624.60] neurotransmitter chemical option that's
[2622.24 - 2627.44] in celery
[2624.60 - 2630.48] juice celery juices naturally occurring
[2627.44 - 2632.60] beneficial sodium is a part of this you
[2630.48 - 2634.92] can't get this in SE salt Himalayan rock
[2632.60 - 2636.20] salt or something else remember science
[2634.92 - 2637.80] and research is so behind with with
[2636.20 - 2639.44] chronic illness you guys have to know
[2637.80 - 2640.88] this every time I'm interviewed now I
[2639.44 - 2643.16] say the same thing you ready I didn't
[2640.88 - 2644.56] know everybody was better I didn't know
[2643.16 - 2646.24] science and research got everybody
[2644.56 - 2648.04] better that's what I tell every
[2646.24 - 2650.64] interviewer now and then they just go
[2648.04 - 2653.40] and write smack about me and put and try
[2650.64 - 2655.08] to publish it because they're irritated
[2653.40 - 2656.64] I say it every time I didn't know the
[2655.08 - 2659.08] science of research you keep on throwing
[2656.64 - 2660.96] at me that doesn't support celery or
[2659.08 - 2662.44] support me or something like that I
[2660.96 - 2663.84] didn't know science of research had
[2662.44 - 2665.56] everybody better I didn't know there was
[2663.84 - 2667.96] wasn't like two billion sick people with
[2665.56 - 2669.56] symptoms on this planet may actually
[2667.96 - 2672.64] more than that with symptoms way more
[2669.56 - 2674.40] than that I didn't know I thought oh so
[2672.64 - 2675.92] you mean they're not all fixed or wait
[2674.40 - 2678.20] they're all fixed everybody's better
[2675.92 - 2679.56] that's what I'm trying to say with the
[2678.20 - 2681.32] science of research you know about
[2679.56 - 2684.36] anybody with chronic
[2681.32 - 2686.36] illness when it was just a decade ago
[2684.36 - 2690.88] they told women to just go and get go
[2686.36 - 2694.48] and get a job if you are lazy and
[2690.88 - 2697.96] tired you're bored you're making it up
[2694.48 - 2697.96] think about that
[2698.84 - 2704.52] unbelievable
[2700.64 - 2706.76] look as I say all water is not the same
[2704.52 - 2709.68] and all sugar is not the same we'll add
[2706.76 - 2712.52] this to the list not all salts the
[2709.68 - 2715.00] same how about that let's go in the
[2712.52 - 2718.28] water this is a good
[2715.00 - 2721.36] one let's hit the water one on the
[2718.28 - 2724.04] subject of water if anyone tells you
[2721.36 - 2726.36] that drinking celery juice is the same
[2724.04 - 2728.60] as drinking water know this they are far
[2726.36 - 2730.20] from the same what you hear from
[2728.60 - 2732.32] dieticians nutritionists health coaches
[2730.20 - 2734.76] or whoever or
[2732.32 - 2737.20] trainers there's some like trainer guy
[2734.76 - 2739.52] out there socalled he's he's known or
[2737.20 - 2741.08] something which I beg to differ he's
[2739.52 - 2743.52] like he's sitting here telling me
[2741.08 - 2745.00] there's no stomach glands meaning he's
[2743.52 - 2747.16] he's saying it on social media he's not
[2745.00 - 2748.64] telling me he's probably trying to tell
[2747.16 - 2750.24] me there's no such thing as stomach
[2748.64 - 2753.12] glands and he posted
[2750.24 - 2755.56] that I there's no sto there's no such
[2753.12 - 2757.68] thing as stomach glands what are you
[2755.56 - 2759.60] talking about of course there is they
[2757.68 - 2761.04] create gastric they gastric juices
[2759.60 - 2765.16] gastric
[2761.04 - 2768.24] acids correct I mean it's correct they
[2765.16 - 2770.36] they actually you know create all kinds
[2768.24 - 2773.92] of
[2770.36 - 2775.84] HCL hydrochloric acid and that's a
[2773.92 - 2777.44] stomach glands but let's go into water a
[2775.84 - 2779.48] little bit you'll get these same
[2777.44 - 2781.68] professionals out there that are just
[2779.48 - 2783.32] quick to just try to deter people from
[2781.68 - 2785.08] doing anything good for themselves cuz
[2783.32 - 2787.72] they think they want to own their space
[2785.08 - 2789.20] and they want to be The Authority so
[2787.72 - 2790.96] they just knock down powerful
[2789.20 - 2794.28] information they'll try to like celery
[2790.96 - 2798.04] juice and they'll say it's all water oh
[2794.28 - 2799.60] that's interesting okay well every
[2798.04 - 2801.56] single person that I've ever talked to
[2799.60 - 2803.92] that had a chronic illness or every
[2801.56 - 2807.96] single person that's ever had a
[2803.92 - 2810.32] symptom I you know water didn't fix it
[2807.96 - 2812.20] sure someone could be
[2810.32 - 2814.08] dehydrated and they could be getting one
[2812.20 - 2815.80] of those lowgrade headaches or something
[2814.08 - 2818.92] and they up their water and it impr
[2815.80 - 2821.84] proves them but people with
[2818.92 - 2824.48] hashimotos people with thyroid disorders
[2821.84 - 2825.80] hyperthyroid people with rheid arthritis
[2824.48 - 2829.12] people with multiple sclerosis Lyme
[2825.80 - 2831.60] disease people with trigeminal neuralgia
[2829.12 - 2835.20] water doesn't fix people with eczema
[2831.60 - 2838.28] sasis dermatitis rosacea water doesn't
[2835.20 - 2840.80] fix people with lyan sclerosis water
[2838.28 - 2843.12] doesn't fix Vitiligo water doesn't
[2840.80 - 2844.96] fix people with severe chronic fatigue
[2843.12 - 2846.84] neurological fatigue or even fatigue
[2844.96 - 2849.16] that's just mild but still always there
[2846.84 - 2852.56] water never fixes
[2849.16 - 2854.48] ever people with headaches migraines
[2852.56 - 2856.76] severe migraines back in the neck pain
[2854.48 - 2859.56] body pain back pain feet pain Mort
[2856.76 - 2862.12] Norton's Morton's neuroma plant
[2859.56 - 2865.08] fasciitis
[2862.12 - 2866.60] digitises in fix I'm going to go on a
[2865.08 - 2868.20] little more people with diabetes water
[2866.60 - 2870.88] doesn't fix but celery juice actually
[2868.20 - 2873.64] reverses diabetes what else I mean we
[2870.88 - 2876.12] can go on and on and on and on and on if
[2873.64 - 2879.92] you actually want to insult The Chronic
[2876.12 - 2882.24] ill really insult them tell them they're
[2879.92 - 2886.04] getting better or they think they're
[2882.24 - 2889.00] getting better with a placebo effect
[2886.04 - 2890.96] possibly because there's water in celery
[2889.00 - 2893.92] juice and they happen to just be you
[2890.96 - 2895.84] know kneading a little extra water
[2893.92 - 2898.84] because they're not drinking enough
[2895.84 - 2900.52] water during the day ever so because now
[2898.84 - 2902.40] they're juicing celery juice that's
[2900.52 - 2905.16] what's giving them a better feeling
[2902.40 - 2906.44] let's just insult The Chronic Le by
[2905.16 - 2907.88] saying that well that's what the
[2906.44 - 2909.36] dietitians are saying they're saying In
[2907.88 - 2911.44] Articles they say it out there they're
[2909.36 - 2912.68] talking about that places that's where
[2911.44 - 2914.12] you know naysayers are saying
[2912.68 - 2915.48] nutritionists whoever and I'm not
[2914.12 - 2916.88] against dietitians or anything like
[2915.48 - 2918.16] there's really some amazing ones that
[2916.88 - 2919.80] actually are drinking celery juice and
[2918.16 - 2921.96] promoting celery juice talking about the
[2919.80 - 2925.08] naysayers anywhere naysayer doctors the
[2921.96 - 2928.40] naysayers the naysayer people
[2925.08 - 2930.80] whatever so that's what's happening here
[2928.40 - 2932.40] when sources say that the only reason
[2930.80 - 2933.96] chronically ill are getting their lives
[2932.40 - 2936.08] back from celery juice is because it
[2933.96 - 2938.36] offers water it's almost incon conable
[2936.08 - 2940.16] I'm sorry but it's almost inconceivable
[2938.36 - 2942.24] it shows confusion and a lack of
[2940.16 - 2944.00] experience and understanding of what
[2942.24 - 2946.00] people have gone through and suffered
[2944.00 - 2947.52] with I've seen it I know it I've been
[2946.00 - 2948.88] there with people side by side I've been
[2947.52 - 2950.64] by their bedsides why they've been
[2948.88 - 2952.56] suffering I've seen it all and this
[2950.64 - 2955.16] means they don't know anything about it
[2952.56 - 2958.00] or what they've been through and what
[2955.16 - 2960.48] they've tried it shows confusion and
[2958.00 - 2962.60] lack of experience I swear to God and an
[2960.48 - 2964.36] lack of understanding people with
[2962.60 - 2967.36] symptoms and
[2964.36 - 2970.20] illnesses and and what they need to do
[2967.36 - 2973.08] to just be on a daily basis to survive
[2970.20 - 2974.48] yes celery juice has more water content
[2973.08 - 2977.24] than other
[2974.48 - 2980.40] sources but it doesn't have more water
[2977.24 - 2982.32] content than a cucumber juice it doesn't
[2980.40 - 2983.80] have meaning like you C juice cucumbers
[2982.32 - 2986.28] and you got a whole thing of cucumber
[2983.80 - 2989.96] juice or you just something it's it it's
[2986.28 - 2992.96] still not as much as that celery juice
[2989.96 - 2996.80] has more water yes but it's hydrob
[2992.96 - 3000.08] bioactive water it's benefit beneficial
[2996.80 - 3002.88] yeah is that my word that's my word
[3000.08 - 3005.08] where's it from Spirit anybody who's
[3002.88 - 3007.12] ever listened to my shows or just tuning
[3005.08 - 3009.84] in here wondering where this information
[3007.12 - 3011.72] comes I hope I don't burst your bubble
[3009.84 - 3014.72] and get you to run the other way but it
[3011.72 - 3017.76] comes from Spirit since I was age
[3014.72 - 3018.84] four it's hydrob bioactive you don't
[3017.76 - 3021.04] trust my
[3018.84 - 3022.92] information well then how come I'm the
[3021.04 - 3024.56] actually first one that said Epstein bar
[3022.92 - 3025.92] causes Hashim modus thyroiditis and I've
[3024.56 - 3028.44] been saying it for decades and now
[3025.92 - 3030.24] science of research they're worried and
[3028.44 - 3031.52] so now they're putting out papers saying
[3030.24 - 3033.56] they think it's linked to it because
[3031.52 - 3035.12] they don't want me to be the so-called
[3033.56 - 3038.36] hero of that
[3035.12 - 3042.36] Discovery and that's from Spirit since I
[3038.36 - 3044.76] was a kid so and lemon water flushing
[3042.36 - 3046.68] the liver that's mine for decades now
[3044.76 - 3049.52] but yet it's like law out there now so
[3046.68 - 3051.92] it is what it is it's not a simple
[3049.52 - 3052.84] matter of water content that's getting
[3051.92 - 3055.44] people
[3052.84 - 3057.64] better if it were if it were ever
[3055.44 - 3062.56] everyone who had tried increasing their
[3057.64 - 3062.56] water intake would have already gotten
[3063.40 - 3068.36] better it's unbelievable on the subject
[3066.56 - 3070.20] of water if anyone tells you that
[3068.36 - 3072.36] drinking celery juice is the same as
[3070.20 - 3075.20] drinking water know this they are far
[3072.36 - 3077.00] from the same water does have naturally
[3075.20 - 3079.16] occurring electrolytes and especially if
[3077.00 - 3082.20] it's high quality water like say like
[3079.16 - 3084.64] fij or something still those
[3082.20 - 3087.36] electrolytes provide entirely different
[3084.64 - 3090.24] benefits from nose and celery juice this
[3087.36 - 3093.48] is not even comparing apples to oranges
[3090.24 - 3096.04] it's like comparing apples to beef water
[3093.48 - 3099.20] and celery juice are two completely
[3096.04 - 3101.96] different substances on all levels only
[3099.20 - 3103.80] the herb celery contains the sodium
[3101.96 - 3104.84] cluster salts the special vitamin C I
[3103.80 - 3106.52] talk about all the different
[3104.84 - 3107.96] antioxidants I talk about in the celery
[3106.52 - 3109.52] juice book all the different
[3107.96 - 3110.96] phytochemical compounds that are
[3109.52 - 3113.92] undiscovered I talk about in the celery
[3110.96 - 3115.56] juice special enzymes trace minerals
[3113.92 - 3118.64] that make celery juice what it is is
[3115.56 - 3121.28] it's suspended it's thick as for putting
[3118.64 - 3123.36] a pinch of salt in a glass of water
[3121.28 - 3125.32] thinking that that's the same or better
[3123.36 - 3127.96] this is even more misguided you
[3125.32 - 3130.00] dehydrating yourself I promise you
[3127.96 - 3132.04] that's what you're doing celery juice on
[3130.00 - 3135.52] the other hand is hydrating on a deep
[3132.04 - 3139.12] level celery juices salt
[3135.52 - 3142.48] water are two different
[3139.12 - 3145.00] worlds so celery juice versus salt water
[3142.48 - 3146.60] are two different worlds they're just
[3145.00 - 3148.28] salt water is an entirely different
[3146.60 - 3150.52] Beast the bottom
[3148.28 - 3152.64] line so you have to know that mixing
[3150.52 - 3154.84] celery juice with water is not a good
[3152.64 - 3157.28] move don't do it because they're so
[3154.84 - 3160.12] different they clash and you stop
[3157.28 - 3163.52] getting your celery juice to work if
[3160.12 - 3167.24] celery juice was all water and that's
[3163.52 - 3170.04] how it helped you why would mixing water
[3167.24 - 3171.96] harm it it kills it literally dilutes it
[3170.04 - 3174.88] and kills it and destroys it cuz it's
[3171.96 - 3177.44] not water they got to remember that
[3174.88 - 3179.56] there's friction between them you can't
[3177.44 - 3181.24] add you it's like oil and water you
[3179.56 - 3184.52] can't there's friction or whatever you
[3181.24 - 3186.88] say adding water to celery juice dilutes
[3184.52 - 3190.16] the sodium cluster salts and deactivates
[3186.88 - 3192.40] them while also interferes with trace
[3190.16 - 3194.68] minerals enzymes some of the most
[3192.40 - 3198.12] powerful aspects of celery juice that
[3194.68 - 3201.16] helps us heal adding ice cubes to celery
[3198.12 - 3202.76] juice same thing bad it destroys the
[3201.16 - 3204.48] ability of the celer juice to heal the
[3202.76 - 3206.68] body here's another point to keep in
[3204.48 - 3208.96] mind when it comes to celery juice some
[3206.68 - 3210.44] sources say that people only feel better
[3208.96 - 3213.48] from celery juice because they're
[3210.44 - 3216.76] getting hydrated by its water
[3213.48 - 3219.20] content these sources say it has nothing
[3216.76 - 3221.72] to do with celery juice itself this is
[3219.20 - 3223.44] an inadvertent insult to the chronically
[3221.72 - 3225.20] Hill remember that I told you that
[3223.44 - 3227.20] earlier it's like telling people who
[3225.20 - 3228.88] have been sick for months or years who
[3227.20 - 3230.80] have looked for everything tried
[3228.88 - 3232.80] everything you name it to drink more
[3230.80 - 3235.96] water that'll fix your
[3232.80 - 3239.84] problem staying hydrated
[3235.96 - 3242.44] is the first advice that any doctor ever
[3239.84 - 3243.56] offers anybody in health and wellness
[3242.44 - 3246.00] when they're
[3243.56 - 3248.24] sick and people carry their water
[3246.00 - 3250.88] bottles everywhere feverishly with them
[3248.24 - 3253.12] because of it and remind themselves to
[3250.88 - 3254.52] drink more water it doesn't get
[3253.12 - 3256.80] everybody out of chronic illness I'm
[3254.52 - 3258.48] sorry it just doesn't these are people
[3256.80 - 3261.56] who have been in the weeds tried
[3258.48 - 3263.72] everything for years water isn't doing
[3261.56 - 3266.24] it but I don't want you to stop drinking
[3263.72 - 3268.16] water because you need the water yes but
[3266.24 - 3270.00] it doesn't pull people out of the depths
[3268.16 - 3271.56] of Despair like celery juice and medical
[3270.00 - 3273.92] medium information
[3271.56 - 3275.76] has and if you're dealing with an
[3273.92 - 3277.92] illness you're going to get results on
[3275.76 - 3279.00] on celery juice but you want to get full
[3277.92 - 3280.52] results if you're dealing with some
[3279.00 - 3281.96] serious stuff going on you get the
[3280.52 - 3284.80] medical meeting books you learn how to
[3281.96 - 3286.28] do the rest like the celery juice book
[3284.80 - 3289.36] and all these other ones and you move
[3286.28 - 3291.32] forward with your life I love you guys
[3289.36 - 3293.60] thank you for hanging in there on this

[3293.60 - 3299.04] I know I've been I know I was ranting
