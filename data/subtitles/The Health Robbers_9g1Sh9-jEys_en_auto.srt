that's the other thing too they've

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,480
brainwashed us

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,840
and taught us about using

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,879
false protection

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,680
false protection that's how it's done

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,200

pulling oil pulling

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,959
but nobody knows that the oil you're

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
using when you do the oil pulling it

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
coats your gums and it conceals and

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
seals

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
all of the bacteria in there and you

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
lose your gums faster

they all just start crumbling but you

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,840

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
joined in in the alternative you found a

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
good guy found a good

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
you know gal in the industry you're

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
getting help from a practitioner they

135
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,520
got you off of bad food

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
they got you off of that i mean they may

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,120
not have known it was bad food

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
without medical medium doing 35 years of

139
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
getting it out there and out there

140
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
but they took the office some bad food

141
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,080
right

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
you're exercising more you're on your

143
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,199
keto diet

144
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
which isn't keto because there's no such

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
thing as a keto diet anymore

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
there's no such thing you can't go into

147
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
ketosis you can't because they let

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
sugar into the keto diet so they call it

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,120
keto no one realizes that all is just a

150
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
clean animal protein diet is all it is

151
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
or a plant-based diet they call keto but

152
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
all it is just

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,880
lots of fat in your plant-based diet but

154
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
there's also sugar everywhere nuts have

155
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
sugar in it

156
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
avocado has sugar in it you can't go

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
into ketosis your body can't go into

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
ketosis when you eat an avocado because

159
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
an avocado is part sugar

160
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,160
part sugar you can only go to keto you

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,919
can only go to ketosis

162
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
the body going literally into ketosis

163
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,160
michelle miller are going to

164
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,400
smoking mountain paradise you can only

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
only go into ketosis

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,880
if no sugar is in there no sugar

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
anywhere right no sugar

168
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,120
and guess what when you go into when you

169
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,680
go into ketosis and you're on a no

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
carb no sugar diet whatsoever no fruit

171
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
no nothing

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,720
you go downhill fast

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,319
boom because guess what i watched people

174
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
die

175
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,479
years and years ago that try to put

176
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
themselves in ketosis

177
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,360
stupidest thing on the planet you know

178
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
why the keto diet is not the keto diet

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
anymore

180
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,160
if they call it a keto diet but it's not

181
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,000
the keto diet you can't go into ketosis

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
because there's sugar in it everywhere

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,919
they let you have a green apple can't go

184
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
it's impossible

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,280
because there's sugar and avocado right

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800

see you

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,520
so we live in this false world of health

193
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,120
the information isn't just

194
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,800
misinformation anymore that's a medical

195
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
medium term by the way

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,759
medical medium didn't create the word

197
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,360
misinformation that was long before my

198
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,479
time

199
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
but medical medium put misinformation

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,560
the word in every single thing saying

201
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
look that's misinformation out there you

202
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
guys that's misinformation now

203
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
now people are saying misinformation out

204
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
there but it's gone beyond that

205
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
it's not it's beyond this information

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
now okay

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,520
it's beyond it is that a place where

208
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
it's just

209
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,560
screwed up it's just totally screwed up

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
so yeah i'm gonna go on the keto diet

211
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
getting rid of fast foods getting rid of

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,599
greasy foods getting rid of processed

214
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
foods you're starting to exercise more

215
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
you're taking a bunch of garbage

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
supplements maybe you'll get one thing

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
in there and you get it in your system

218
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,120
and then you think you found the holy

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,680
grail which you just found all you found

220
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,039

249
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
that's not having your back

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
it's not the practitioner's fault of the

251
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
doctor's fault here's your whey protein

252
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
powder that's going to get you

253
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
sick because the bugs in you that got

254
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,519
you sick

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
are going to feed off that whey protein

256
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,000
powder here's your l-carnitine

257
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
but you don't know it no one knows it

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,959
really unless they heard it here it's

259
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,839
the only place you could have

260
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,120
l-carnitine

261
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,080
feeds pathogens rapidly so when you take

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,519
out carnitine

263
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,240
products you're gonna feed your bugs

264
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,920
and let you know basically land up real

265
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,680
sick

266
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,519
okay and classified research and science

267
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,399
raised all the bugs that we have now

268
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,560
and then it took doctors to to find them

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
by accident did you guys know that

270
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
did you guys know that did you know

271
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
epsilon bar

272
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,680
did you know epstein-barr virus the

273
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,640
cause of hashimoto's thyroiditis

274
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
the cause of fibromyalgia the cause of

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
rheumatoid arthritis the cause of

276
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
neurological

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,959
lyme the cause

278
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,680
half the cause of eczema and psoriasis

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,839
the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,560
cause of mystery brain inflammation for

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
most

282
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,800
cases usually my epstein-barr virus did

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,839
you know the epstein-barr

284
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,720
virus right was discovered in the 60s

285
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,760
1960s right like dr epstein dr barr

286
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
okay and did you know

287
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,320
those guys that was the public medical

288
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,920
research and science

289
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,320
those were public medical research and

290
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,519
science virologists

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,399
they weren't the classified

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,360
medical research and science virologists

293
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,160
the ones

294
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,040
that already knew about epstein-barr

295
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,079
before 1920

296
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,600
before 1920.

297
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,079
chris you seem fine to me we know this

298
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,839
information because of anthony

299
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,640

to see you darcy lee good to see you

301
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
so the classified medical research and

302
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,720
science

303
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
that the publicly known is not privy to

304
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
you know the classified that put out

305
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
that plague

306
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
right the classified that's out there it

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,760
puts out every single

308
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,160
plague every single all the viruses

309
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,959
they already put out f steam bar virus

310
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,079
they already sent it out

311
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
they already sent it out before 1920

312
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,839
and then it sat around that virus got

313
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
people sick it spread it spread the

314
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
epstein-barr spread it mutated more

315
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
varieties came out of it more varieties

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
came

317
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,079
out of it

318
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,399
and then what happened was

319
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
dr barr and dr epstein were in their lab

320
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,279
in their

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,680
public public virologists

322
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,360
they discovered it they didn't discover

323
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,040
it they found what was already thrown

324
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
out there by classified medical research

325
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,600
and science

326
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,399
you know it's like just like security

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,320
secrecy secrecy

328
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600

329
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,519
tell you why

330
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
because all this time alternative

331
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,839
medicine

332
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
didn't know anything didn't know

333
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,480
anything

334
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,000
didn't know nothing it's try this snake

335
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440

336
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,279
try this snake oil and see if you can

337
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,920
get better try this and see if you get

338
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
better

339
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,399
oh okay lyme disease well lyme disease

340
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,880
in 1970s early 1970s let's just

341
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,079
antibiotic you guys to death no one's

342
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,920
protecting anybody

343
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,360
so we got a wave of people that lost

344
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
their lives from lyme disease not

345
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,880
because of lyme disease not because of

346
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
the real reason of lyme disease which

347
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,920
i've seen more virus they lost their

348
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,519
lives because

349
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:35,040
they were antibiotic to death by

350
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,920
the publicly known research in science

351
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
and meanwhile the epstein-barr that's

352
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,600
behind

353
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
neurological limes was put out there by

354
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
the

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,760
classified medical research and science

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,519
you guys get the gist of how it works

357
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,720
out there

358
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
i mean this is unbelievable information

359
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
i mean

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,160
boom it all comes together

361
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,519
so we're making spinach soup we're

362
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079

they protecting you guys because i'm

367
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,079
scratching my head on that one

368
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,279
is it that because medical research and

369
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,720
science

370
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,240
okay both alternative and conventional

371
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,279
they don't know why anybody's sick but i

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
love how billions of dollars go into the

373
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,040
stupidest crap like the collagen

374
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,560
right so is that protecting you the

375
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,760
collagen powder

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,839
it can't it's not you can't eat collagen

377
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,600
and create collagen that's original

378
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,120
medical meme information guess what

379
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,480
now there's a couple of products out

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
there where they take like a little bit

381
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
of this and a little bit of that a

382
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
little bit of nettle or a little bit of

383
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,560
something else they put it together and

384
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
they say

385
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
and now they say medical medium

386
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,880
information supplement companies

387
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
and they say oh yeah you can't you can't

388
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
create

389
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
collagen you have to build it you need

390
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
the building blocks you need plant food

391
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,519
building blocks that's original mm info

392
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,120
once again taken so there's two kinds of

393
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,000
thieves out there

394
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,600
there's the industry that's a thief they

395
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,839
steal your health

396
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
they steal it they steal it and they rob

397
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,000
it that's what they do you don't believe

398
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,839
me

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
fine fine am i pissing you off five five

400
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,600
you don't want to watch this fine i

401
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,120
don't say right

402
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
because oh no he doesn't know what he's

403
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
talking about i go to my practitioner i

404
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,560
got my practitioner i get all the things

405
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
i need i'm feeling better because i'm

406
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,160
keeping out the bad food um exercising a

407
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,360
little more

408
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,639
you know there's a lot of people they

409
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
just they haven't been there they

410
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,440
haven't been

411
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
sick enough to actually know that

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,560
they've been duped they've been duped

413
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
renee says also confusing is my blood

414
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,199
work

415
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,519
showed reactivated but my pcr test is

416
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,240
completely negative

417
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,760
i'm now at a loss i just spent over five

418
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,240
thousand dollars to find out why

419
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
i was running a temperature every

420
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
afternoon

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,040
feeling awful and sweating through my

422
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,199
clothes at night

423
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,680
it's been a year marginally better

424
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
but i still have this mystery illness my

425
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,160
doctor is clueless renee that's how it

426
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
works out there

427
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,320
that's how it works take the book to

428
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,680
your doctor

429
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,040
okay take the book to your doctor

430
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,959
ask your doctor if it's okay to do

431
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,880
things in here

432
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,160
and get it fixed get it fixed

433
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,800
the whole reason why these books are

434
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
here reactivated epsilon bar is medical

435
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
medium information

436
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
doctors never took they never tested for

437
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
reactivated epstein-barr

438
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,279
until medical medium books were

439
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,680
published so it is

440
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,320
mm info if your doctor's even checking

441
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,279
are testing for reactivated epstein-barr

442
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
it's mm info

443
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
and reactivated epsom bar is not even

444
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
easy to even find

445
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
because there's over 60 varieties of

446
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
epstein-barr and that's the whole thing

447
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,160
people don't have the answers they don't

448
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,240
have the information

449
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,839
the medical system doesn't and you learn

450
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,920
that when you're really sick

451
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,920
there's a way to heal it's a way to heal

452
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,920
okay and

453
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,279
now they didn't even know epsilon bar

454
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
has anything to do with anybody being

455
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,160
sick they thought it gave you tiredness

456
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
and malaise when you had mono and that

457
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
was it

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,399
gone forever and

459
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
and then they they thought epsilon bar

460
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
only was one virus

461
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,680
medical medium put out that there's over

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,399
60 varieties of epstein-barr

463
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
right you guys now guess what science

464
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
research

465
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
publicly known science and research is

466
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,560
now saying there's two varieties of

467
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,759
epstein-barr

468
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,079
two varieties of epsom bar important you

469
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,360
know

470
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,639
medical medium is always on track

471
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,160
it has a record of it it's the only

472
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,560
published information that said there's

473
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
more than one epstein-barr virus

474
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,399
nowhere else in the world has it existed

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
i taught this for years and i've

476
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
published it too

477
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
now i've seen now science research is

478
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,839
saying there's two varieties

479
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,160
did they yet learn about the other 58

480
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,600
varieties

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,039
because there's over 60 varieties so

482
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,799
it's already been published first

483
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,799
important enough

484
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:18,000
if you're new here that's a major deal

485
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,280
that's a major major amazing thing you

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
mean to tell me he knew there's more

487
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
than one variety of episode bar the

488
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
science of research is talking about it

489
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,319
years later

490
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,319
and then neurological fatigue fatigue

491
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,240
that's a that's in medical medium term

492
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,880
neurological fatigue

493
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,919
no one knew that it's neurological the

494
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
fatigue

495
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,039
just thought you're tired and then they

496
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,600
thought it's your adrenals only

497
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,440
then they thought you're crazy but

498
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
nobody knew it's from the brain becoming

499
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
inflamed

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
it's neurological fatigue your nerves

501
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,360
being inflamed

502
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,919
by the epstein-barr virus

503
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,160
so who's looking out for everybody

504
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,720
because it's a wasteland of answers

505
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,000
and now podcast doctors are stealing it

506
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
so that's what they're doing now

507
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,039
so you got two kinds of thieves out

508
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,200
there you've got the thieves

509
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,520
the industries that want to steal your

510
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,440
health and take literally rob and steal

511
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,799
your health and steal any chance you can

512
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
heal and the alternative movement will

513
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
join in give you all the collagen

514
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,080
all the whey protein powder i'm just

515
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,120
naming a few things and they'll join in

516
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,960
and just show you just lose you lose

517
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
and then there's the other thieves

518
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
podcast doctors that take medical medium

519
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,919
information

520
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
abuse it don't cite where it comes from

521
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
and pretend they know what they're

522
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
talking about because they're desperate

523
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,799
for something new

524
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,000
right another thief and that thief

525
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,880
doesn't help anybody either

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,320
so who's got your back i want to know i

527
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,440

nerve i mean it's all neurological in

538
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,160
here so much neurological information

539
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
just look up

540
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520

numbness

547
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,840
you steal medical medium information and

548
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,559
try to discredit me at the same time

549
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
that's what they do now i don't care

550
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,960

just that when you can't find your way

556
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
to the real information to where it all

557
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
comes from

558
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
it hurts that's what hurts because it

559
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,000
keeps people from healing

560
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,760

this compassion in the world

701
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,880
the doctors go into the business with

702
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,960
compassion

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
and what to do for you the doctors come

707

been proven wrong i used to say this all

713
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
the time

714
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,320
you guys have heard it a million times

715
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
the doctor's hearts are in it they

716
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
become a doctor because they want you

717
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,960
better

718
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,400
they don't know better of what they're

719
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,760
doing or what they offer they don't have

720
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,559
the answers medical school's not

721
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,640
teaching them

722
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,480
but you have to give the doctors the

723
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
benefit of the doubt because the doctor

724
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,080
is a good person and wants you better

725
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
i'm wrong boom wrong

726
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,320
because there's a new doctor out there

727
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,760
and it's the internet doctor

728
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,760
and they suck they suck

729
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
because they want people sick they

730
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,440
they're paid to keep people sick

731
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,039
they want people chronically ill they

732
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
stamp them out of medical schools left

733
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,320
and right

734
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
and they don't go to work they just get

735
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,720
on the internet

736
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
and they're the young doctor that's

737
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,919
coming out now it's this young line of

738
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,760
doctors

739
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
that are stamped on a medical school

740
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,039
they don't want the job really and they

741
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,480
don't want to work because the minute

742
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
they worked a day in their life

743
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
they came out of medical school and they

744
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,720
started working in a practice for two

745
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
seconds they realized

746
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
it was just too hard everybody's sick

747
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
nobody knows why

748
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,279
and they just whoa they're so entitled

749
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,279
they back up and then they get

750
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,520
a job as an internet doctor and then

751
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,360
they literally try to stop the

752
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,240
chronically ill from

753
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,919
chronically ill from healing yeah

754
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,840
they're selfie doctors

755
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,440
chris it's a new doctor that came out

756
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,039
and you know what happens you put out

757
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,559
your healing story

758
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
and then you get a whole bunch of

759
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,919
doctors going on there saying you didn't

760
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,679
heal you didn't heal

761
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,960
there's no signs of research to show

762
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,760
back up that you got rid of your

763
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,840

and they're doctors

768
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,000

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
chiropractors

770
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,400

784
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,440
because for decades i've been saying

785
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,799
every doctor that goes and becomes a

786
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
doctor they got their heart in it and

787
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,360
they got compassion

788
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,840
and they want you better they just don't

789
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,200
know the answers you can't blame them

790
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,200
they're all good people because their

791
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,000
hearts in it they came into it this way

792
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,679
i was wrong i was wrong

793
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,440
you guys need to know the traps out

794
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,200
there because the traps are just getting

795
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
bigger and uglier and bigger and uglier

796
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
and then next thing you know everybody's

797
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,640
peer pressure you need to do something

798
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,679
that could hurt you too

799
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,880
therese rock hi ew how much spinach

800
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:20,480
is too much to eat studies say it has

801
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,480
folates that can damage kidneys

802
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,720
studies are wrong studies don't know why

803
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,480
you're sick

804
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,279
studies don't know why anybody sick

805
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,799
studies don't know why a baby has eczema

806
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,240
studies don't know why someone has

807
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,640
fatigue studies don't know why anything

808
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,080
studies don't know anything besides

809
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,520
telling you caffeine is good for you so

810
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,720
what does that tell you

811
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,919
because you know caffeine is bad for you

812
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
then why are studies telling you it's

813
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,440
good

814
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,399
so what does that mean studies are also

815
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
paid for

816
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,720
studies are also traps studies are also

817
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
created and paid for to stop you from

818
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,840
eating spinach

819
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
studies are there to stop you from

820
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,640
taking care of yourself because once

821
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,840
again we're back to that

822
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,799
we're back to paid for corrupt finger

823
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
thumb on the scale science and research

824
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,080

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120

and then your dog waiting for a bow and

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
gotta wait for one more study

882
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,440

883
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,080
omega-3s and chicken eggs

884
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,039

885
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,039
our memory

886
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,080
omega-3s and chicken eggs can help our

887
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,240
memory okay

888
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,519
okay here we go there we go oh another

889
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,679
dog guy oh no

890
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,360
no okay when was the other dog we're

891
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,679
still left we got some dogs left

892
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
we do oh no ten years go by let's get

893
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,320
another study going

894
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,720
let's go it's terrible

895
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,000
and and that's what happens because

896
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
we're just dogs

897
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,640
waiting for a bone and that's what we

898
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,720
are and people don't realize it

899
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,159
they just don't get it they don't get it

900
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,360
and it's really really sad it is

901
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,320
because you won't eat the spinach

902
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,080
all you need is one one warning flare

903
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,039
where is it one warning flare

904
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,039
where's that warning flare

905
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,640
here it is it's a study you spinach

906
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,120

there's a flare all you need is one

908
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,600
warning flare

909
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,000
and in the back of your mind that

910
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,000
brainwashing is going to take over

911
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080

though

915
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,039
so in every single study says

916
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,320
inconclusive except for the caffeine

917
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,320
studies

918
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,760
inconclusive except for the caffeine

919
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,039
studies caffeine industry they don't

920
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,399
even want the word inconclusive there

921
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,760
they just want to be like no you drink

922
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,880

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,200
fear in you that eggs are going to hurt

935
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,200
you but if you got

936
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,120
a sickness of any kind a symptom a

937
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,279
condition and something you don't want

938
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,440
eggs are just going to keep it around

939
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,880
they're gonna keep it around forever

940
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,159
is all that's gonna happen yeah

941
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,559
yeah we we all love eggs

942
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,600
but classified medical research and

943
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,880
science

944
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,679
took your egg and they cut open the tops

945
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,159
they cut open the tops you guys back

946
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,320
before

947
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,399
1920 they cut open the tops the

948
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,840
classified medical research and signs

949
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,080
cut open the tops

950
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,480
and then they found out they can grow

951
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,440
bugs inside those eggs because there's

952
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,120
undeveloped

953
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,960
proteins in eggs pathogens feed off of

954
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:36,399
undeveloped proteins and eggs and so

955
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,080
they've ruined our eggs you don't stand

956
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,399
a chance if you're really

957
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,240
sick if you're on eggs because if you're

958
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,760
really sick you've got some bugs going

959
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,279
on you've got the epstein bars maybe the

960
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,840
simplexes that have gone a little too

961
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,360
far

962
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,840
maybe the sediment virus maybe the hhv

963
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,440
hb6

964
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,960
hhv 7 hhv-8 you got all these dip

965
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,360
shingles

966
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
streptococcus all these different bugs

967
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
they'll feed off of these because when

968
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
you eat them

969
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,159
you eat them you eat the egg you don't

970
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,000
want eggs on your spinach soup

971
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,839
or your spinach salad sarah dillon

972
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,879

for that

983
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,760
where's the study for that how do you

984
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,399
heal kidneys

985
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
leafy greens help to heal kidneys and

986
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,280
spinach is a leafy green

987
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,919
chicken that will kill a kidney

988
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,359
will kill a kidney i've heard stories of

989
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,440
people getting kidney transplant brand

990
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,200
new kidney transplant

991
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,839
they killed the kidney real early from

992
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,599
just

993
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,760
eating chicken in the hospital trying to

994
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,480
recover the brand new kidney was like oh

995
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,240
my god i'm in shock the body's in shock

996
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
and you're dumping that in me right now

997
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,000
i'm not anti-animal protein

998
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,680
eating you guys if you guys like that

999
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,680
i'm not anti-vegan plant-based

1000
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,680
i'm just saying i'm about knowing

1001
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,359

i like spinach i always do i like

1032
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:31,200
spinach soups to be thicker

1033
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,320
it's like colitis they cut your colon

1034
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,920
out

1035
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,920
because they don't know why you're sick

1036
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,520
you're going to bathroom you're filling

1037
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,560
the toilet up with blood

1038
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,880
you're in agony i don't know why

1039
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,119
they give you steroids and more steroids

1040
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,240
the hopes to stop it

1041
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,440
hopes to stop it right emergency

1042
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,280
medicine right

1043
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
they're giving you steroids to try to

1044
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,640
stop the bleeding and bleeding

1045
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,280
and then it just isn't working

1046
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,560
and then you're getting 22 inches of

1047
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,240
your colon cut out

1048
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,079
you're getting 12 inches of your colon

1049
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,640
cut out because

1050
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,000
or you get your whole entire colon cut

1051
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,400
out

1052
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,119
because they don't know why you got the

1053
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,640
colitis

1054
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,560
but you can learn the truth of what

1055
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,240
causes colitis in the books

1056
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,400
you can learn the truth the medical

1057
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
medium books and then you know the truth

1058
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,520
of what causes colitis this is a prime

1059
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,920
example

1060
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,599
but how many colons have they cut out i

1061
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,720
can't tell you how many people knocked

1062
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,160
on my door

1063
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,640
in the last 35 years right

1064
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,760
with already their colon removed and i

1065
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,560
just was brokenhearted because it didn't

1066
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,760
have to go that way

1067
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,400
so sad so sad

1068
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,000
so i published the books so people

1069
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,320
couldn't just see me one on

1070
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,160
one and and you know and then what about

1071
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,640
everybody else

1072
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,520
charlie says does excess spinach intake

1073
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,400
cause stones

1074
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,440
no no there's no study that can show

1075
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,119
that

1076
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,480
there's no research in science that has

1077
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,480
a scope that goes in your body

1078
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,680
to say watch that spinach it's starting

1079
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
to create a stone

1080
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,240
are you kidding that doesn't even exist

1081
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,920
and who's eating that much spinach

1082
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,839
i didn't know everybody's eating so much

1083
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
spinach because i just spent 35 years

1084
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,960
trying to get people to eat spinach and

1085
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880

1130
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,400
you're not keto

1131
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,440
you can't go into ketosis just sugar and

1132
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,359
avocado

1133
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,800
i hear it all the time doctors go what

1134
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,040
the heck in there go you're right

1135
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
yeah you can only go into ketosis if you

1136
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,640
got no carbohydrate whatsoever on any

1137
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,440
level has to be completely eliminated

1138
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:11,839
for the body to go into ketosis

1139
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,839
but it's like who even eats spinach

1140
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,480
unbelievable like science or research

1141
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,280
thinks that

1142
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,560
knows does it first of all you guys find

1143
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
that funny i just want to ask you this

1144
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
right here

1145
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
if science research doesn't know what

1146
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,359
causes any of your autoimmune conditions

1147
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
whatsoever

1148
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,800
in any of your symptoms and conditions

1149
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,000
right

1150
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,640
except when you get heart disease and

1151
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,640
they still don't know the cause

1152
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,319
but when scientific research still

1153
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,599
doesn't know why anybody's sick and they

1154
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,400
don't know why your children have eczema

1155
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,000
now because guess what there's

1156
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
commercials on television with kids with

1157
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
eczema it's like what you know what that

1158
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,720
means right

1159
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,440
millions of kids have eczema millions

1160
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,960
science and research doesn't know this

1161
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,160

1301
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
there

1302
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,920
what you'll find in my so-called rants

doctors that are on the internet

1403
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,920
purposely trying to derail people by the

1404
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,119

thought there'd be cold-hearted doctors

1407
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,680
but guess what we have a new age and a

1408
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,440

in their practice and then hops on the

1413
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,720
internet and does their thing and does

1414
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,599
their own

1415
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,960

i'd ask myself do i ever bloat on

1457
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,800
anything else

1458
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,559

nothing bloats me i'm going through life

1460
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,640
i'm going through life i would ask

1461
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,240
myself this

1462
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,760
nothing bloats me i wasn't bloated last

1463
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,200
week when i didn't eat a potato

1464
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,040
i wasn't bloated last month when i

1465
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,839
didn't eat a potato i wasn't bloated two

1466
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,280
days ago

1467
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,960
i'm not bloated now i'd ask myself or am

1468
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,480
i bloated two weeks ago did i blow up

1469
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,079
from some other food did i bloat for

1470
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,599
something i eat did i blow and what you

1471
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,960
might find out is you're bloating no

1472
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,680
matter what periodically because you

1473
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,440
have a bloat problem

1474
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,880
right and then you might have potato

1475
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,520
the wrong way was it steamed did it have

1476
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,240
oil on it did it have fat on it

1477
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,720

1486
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,200
steamed on a mono level

1487
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,760
mono eating cleanse level by the way you

1488
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,640
guys like i said mono eating cleanse

1489
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,839
challenge in july you want to be there

1490
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,839
i'm just letting you know

1491
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,720
have that book so these are the things i

1492
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,480
would actually ask myself

1493
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,240
or weren't you just perfectly fine never

1494
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,760
bloated ever all's good and then you ate

1495
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,400
a potato and you blowed it and like well

1496
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,800
that potato bloated me

1497
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,160
so kind of keep all that in mind did you

1498
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,160
do the potato the right way are you

1499
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,040
bloating anyway did you bloat the day

1500
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,960
after

1501
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,400
some other bad food but then you had a

1502
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,000
potato a day after and thought the

1503
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,920
potato was doing it

1504
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,839
when really you had a slice of vegan

1505
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,440
pizza a week ago and you're still

1506
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,280
bloated from that all these things are

1507
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,880
important enough

1508
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,000
manny palmer the mono eating takes me

1509
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,160
out of a bloating flair it does

1510
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,839
you can mono eat potatoes and get out of

1511
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,839

but she will get sick and she will pass

1549
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,480
away at one point

1550
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,240

1551
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,640
did she get sick with when she passed

1552
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,720

1553
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,559
did she get the flu and she didn't have

1554
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,839
enough zinc in her system and she passed

1555
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,799

if you eat right you don't get sick

1615
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:58,480
easily and avoid food that causes

1616
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:02,480
internal body inflammation

1617
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,880
it's not the reality of it it's not

1618
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,599
so you're telling plant-based people

1619
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
that are on a keto plant-based diet

1620
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,400
they're so called eating right and

1621
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,839
balanced in their plant-based but they

1622
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,040
get sick or they lose all their teeth or

1623
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,480
something starts out their teeth are

1624
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,640
falling apart or they get sick

1625
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,640
they get hives you're telling me that

1626
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,319
their plant-based diet that was like

1627
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,599
healthy avocados every day and all that

1628
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,440
that every single doctor would say

1629
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,680
they're eating right on

1630
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,280
you mean to tell me that well then why

1631
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,040
they get sick it happens every day

1632
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,640
plant-based people go screaming and

1633
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,000
running from the plant-based diet into

1634
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,920
back to the animal protein diet they

1635
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,079
start eating eggs out of nowhere

1636
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,559
it's not about just eating i know people

1637
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,760
that are eating terrible

1638
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,680
but they're not sick they're terrible

1639
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,920
because they don't have a pathogen they

1640
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,520
don't have the virus they don't have

1641
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,319
epstein-barr they don't have that okay

1642
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,400
they're not dealing with that they don't

1643
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,440
have three epstein bars in a shingles

1644
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,760
virus

1645
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,880
they don't have they don't have toxic

1646
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,799
heavy metals

1647
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,799
they may not be high in mercury where

1648
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,839
the virus is eating all the mercury

1649
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,599
they're not you know and that's the

1650
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,200
whole thing because that's what i mean

1651
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,640
you could be on the best keto diet

1652
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,240
best animal protein diet best

1653
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,760
plant-based diet that's everything and

1654
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,119
you still get your butt sick

1655
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,400
and you end up sick and now you don't

1656
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,599
know what to do and you're seeing all

1657
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,880

1700
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,799
where you get the most out of

1701
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,599
spinach and if you can't eat a lot of

1702
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,440

1789
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,720
stool

1790
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,880
or would i like a compacted hard

1791
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:56,079
constipated stool stuck

1792
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,480
somewhere in a pocket in the colon where

1793
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,440
i'm

1794
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,160
struggling to get that baby out and i'm

1795
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,280
straining

1796
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,400

attack

1798
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,640
because i can't get that stool out

1799
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:13,760
and it's putting pressure in my gut and

1800
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:17,520
making me feel swollen and bloated

1801
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,520

1802
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,680

01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,599
some new pathogens along the way

1863
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,760

2045
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,320
so i tell people about that that's the

2046
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,440
vimergina leaf i'm not sponsored but

2047
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,120
that's the one i give

2048
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,560
family and friends that say hey i've had

2049
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,199
a lot i've been watching your vinegar

2050
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,280
stuff

2051
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,040
and i've had so much vinegar over the

2052
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,000
years i have teeth problems i got other

2053
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,199
stuff like that

2054
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,679
and i'm like well you make sure you're

2055
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,239
doing some metal leaf that can actually

2056
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,440
at least

2057
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:59,360
help reinforce uh that's the vimerginato

2058
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,920
leaf it's no alcohol in it it's the real

2059
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,960
thing

2060
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,520
these victor i am ergy dot com

2061
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,960
i want to make sure people have options

2062
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,239
at least something that's helpful

2063
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,080
because i know people just down the

2064
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,600
calcium they'll think that will fix it

2065
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,520
but you need other things it's not

2066
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,520
that's not how it works lemons is

2067
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,520
another one so like lemon water

2068
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,520
medical medium 16 to 32 ounces of lemon

2069
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,640
water every single morning can help with

2070
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,400
the calcium

2071
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,000
and spinach soup so that's another

2072
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,360
reason why we're doing the spinach soup

2073
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,280

2093
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,840
alcohol but i called them and they

2094
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,920
assured me it's

2095
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,080
it's flax glycerin yeah it's far from

2096
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,880
alcohol there's no alcohol in there

2097
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,560
um flax glycerin is actually incredible

2098
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,120

2099
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,800
so yeah that's advanced that's how

2100
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,040
advanced the company is

2101
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,159
i think they're the first company that

2102
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,159
used flax

2103
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,840

2108
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,040
companies are just using the worst

2109
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,000
corn glycerin and they're using uh

2110
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,239

2111
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,239
you know all this other junk and garbage

2112
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,080

01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,440
killers and you use all this stuff

2116
