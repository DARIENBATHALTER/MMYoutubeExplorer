[73.92 - 78.88] greetings from germany
[75.52 - 79.76] cool cool so i got the mm 900 hds right
[78.88 - 82.32] here i'm gonna do
[79.76 - 83.36] celery that's what i'm gonna do and i'm
[82.32 - 84.56] gonna show you something it's really
[83.36 - 86.00] cool because everybody's totally
[84.56 - 90.08] freaking out about the pulp
[86.00 - 92.32] thing about how virtually i had no pulp
[90.08 - 93.92] and it was dry to the bone and i had
[92.32 - 96.64] this much celery juice
[93.92 - 98.00] and that's because this specific model
[96.64 - 100.24] there's other models that look like this
[98.00 - 102.72] from omega but it's not this
[100.24 - 104.88] model this has a device here at the end
[102.72 - 105.28] that actually makes it so it squeezes
[104.88 - 108.48] almost
[105.28 - 110.48] every last drop out of that celery so
[108.48 - 112.40] it's saving money like this year alone i
[110.48 - 113.36] know i saved a ton of money half the
[112.40 - 115.12] celery cost
[113.36 - 116.40] easy half the celery cost so i'm not
[115.12 - 118.56] throwing away my
[116.40 - 120.00] my my celery juice through the pulp and
[118.56 - 120.56] stuff or whatever discarding it or
[120.00 - 123.04] throwing
[120.56 - 124.64] throwing it in the garden or whatever
[123.04 - 127.12] and then the juice goes with it
[124.64 - 128.72] so what's amazing about this is this
[127.12 - 129.60] machine is squeezing it out and i'm
[128.72 - 130.48] going to show you how to i'm going to
[129.60 - 132.08] show you how to do it and i'm going to
[130.48 - 133.92] show you how the pulp works we're

[199.36 - 203.84] how i look at it to you it's like
[201.12 - 204.64] this juicer right here has paid for
[203.84 - 206.88] itself
[204.64 - 208.72] so it's paid for itself that's what it's
[206.88 - 210.64] done you know my other juicers that i've
[208.72 - 212.08] had i have a closet full of a few of
[210.64 - 213.36] them i have a garage full
[212.08 - 215.44] of a bunch of them because i've tried
[213.36 - 217.92] every juicer out there and
[215.44 - 220.00] they don't pay for themselves and that's
[217.92 - 220.80] what's crazy it's like i want a juicer
[220.00 - 223.68] to actually
[220.80 - 225.04] you know pay for itself to work for me
[223.68 - 228.00] you know to work for me
[225.04 - 228.88] and this one does it's crazy so you save
[228.00 - 230.56] all that money
[228.88 - 233.04] because you're squeezing every last drop
[230.56 - 235.04] out of out of the celery
[233.04 - 236.40] and it's a it's a big deal so it's
[235.04 - 238.24] really cool so
[236.40 - 239.84] um i'm gonna make sure you know gonna
[238.24 - 240.72] show show you guys how it works going to

[242.32 - 248.24] questions if i can too
[244.48 - 252.24] so this is it right here
[248.24 - 252.24] putting some celery in it as we speak
[253.20 - 259.68] i'm just looking for my little plunger
[256.40 - 262.00] it's uh running some now
[259.68 - 263.20] is that juicer just for celery no it's
[262.00 - 266.40] not angela
[263.20 - 268.88] it's a celery juicer which is amazing
[266.40 - 270.80] but you can juice anything in it because
[268.88 - 272.96] it's not it's a top-notch juicer
[270.80 - 274.96] like like the best in my opinion
[272.96 - 277.92] personal opinion the best
[274.96 - 279.20] so it's so great so i'm running some
[277.92 - 280.88] celery right through it now
[279.20 - 283.20] i gotta show you guys like the
[280.88 - 286.48] difference with the pulp like what that
[283.20 - 287.52] is how incredible that is hello from
[286.48 - 292.00] ontario so
[287.52 - 294.96] cool so if anybody just got on here now
[292.00 - 297.76] um well that's a good question dr sebby
[294.96 - 300.08] said celery was bad a hybrid thoughts
[297.76 - 300.88] well first of all dr sebby was still
[300.08 - 303.12] here
[300.88 - 305.36] because i know he passed away if he was
[303.12 - 306.96] still here and he saw what happened with
[305.36 - 309.20] the celery juice movement
[306.96 - 310.64] and he saw millions of people healing
[309.20 - 312.48] and he saw tens of
[310.64 - 314.00] thousands of healing stories people
[312.48 - 316.32] getting out of wheelchairs
[314.00 - 318.00] people getting their lives back acid
[316.32 - 321.12] reflux going away
[318.00 - 322.88] migraines going away difficult
[321.12 - 325.04] menstruations going away
[322.88 - 326.24] if he saw everything happening from
[325.04 - 328.80] celery juice
[326.24 - 330.72] i think he would change his mind because
[328.80 - 332.00] i know he was theorizing because that's
[330.72 - 333.92] what these guys do because there's no
[332.00 - 335.12] there's no science that would state that
[333.92 - 338.00] celery is bad
[335.12 - 340.72] so he was theorizing that it was bad and
[338.00 - 343.12] if he was alive today dr sebby
[340.72 - 344.96] he would actually probably be bowing
[343.12 - 346.08] down to celery juice because his
[344.96 - 347.84] patients
[346.08 - 349.20] would be coming in talking about how
[347.84 - 350.80] it's saving their lives
[349.20 - 353.04] like some of the other doctors out there
[350.80 - 356.80] and stuff so that's how i kind of
[353.04 - 359.20] look at it in that way plus when dr
[356.80 - 361.68] sebby was here i was still here too i've
[359.20 - 364.96] been doing this for 35 years
[361.68 - 368.00] and and
[364.96 - 371.36] i was already getting my people better
[368.00 - 373.36] by the truckloads over the decades and
[371.36 - 374.88] um and they were getting their lives
[373.36 - 376.64] back from celery juice while
[374.88 - 378.32] while he was telling people don't drink
[376.64 - 379.60] it it's just really it just it's
[378.32 - 382.48] unbelievable really
[379.60 - 382.80] when you think about it so celery juice
[382.48 - 386.16] has
[382.80 - 388.00] shaped and changed chronic illness today
[386.16 - 390.48] and when you think about how powerful
[388.00 - 393.28] that is and how amazing that is it's
[390.48 - 393.92] actually breathtaking like the results
[393.28 - 395.12] so
[393.92 - 397.84] [Music]
[395.12 - 399.20] um i know you can't see it too easy
[397.84 - 400.32] right you probably can't see it easy
[399.20 - 402.16] i'll show you
[400.32 - 404.08] i know someone's saying move camera down
[402.16 - 406.48] i know it's difficult to get a good shot
[404.08 - 406.48] today
[407.44 - 411.68] so this is the i just saw a question why
[409.76 - 413.04] do i feel like this is the best juicer
[411.68 - 415.52] well
[413.04 - 416.64] what it does is it's got a device on it
[415.52 - 419.68] right
[416.64 - 420.24] that squeezes all the juice out of
[419.68 - 422.08] celery
[420.24 - 423.28] i can't find a juicer on the market
[422.08 - 426.56] that's ever done that
[423.28 - 427.52] i've purchased them all so when i
[426.56 - 431.20] purchased this
[427.52 - 433.04] this one it was always the best juicer
[431.20 - 436.08] company anyway but when they put the
[433.04 - 438.40] device on it to make it just for celery
[436.08 - 440.08] to get really squeeze that celery juice
[438.40 - 442.00] out it changed everything
[440.08 - 444.80] it was like okay well this is a miracle
[442.00 - 445.92] because i'm saving a ton of money each
[444.80 - 448.08] year
[445.92 - 450.00] and that's that's a big deal celery
[448.08 - 452.24] juice cured me from my debilitating
[450.00 - 454.96] migraines michelle marie said
[452.24 - 456.88] right i wonder what dr sebby would say
[454.96 - 459.12] about that one
[456.88 - 460.72] because he doesn't he didn't like celery
[459.12 - 461.68] and it cured you of your debilitating
[460.72 - 463.68] migraines
[461.68 - 465.20] that's what i'm talking about that's
[463.68 - 467.28] what i'm talking about that's
[465.20 - 469.52] such a big deal that means everything
[467.28 - 473.12] honestly that means everything
[469.52 - 474.72] so you'll see pulp coming out right now
[473.12 - 476.00] and this isn't just for celery you could
[474.72 - 476.80] use anything in this juicer that's
[476.00 - 478.72] what's incredible
[476.80 - 480.32] that's what i love so i'm juicing a
[478.72 - 482.24] little bit more i'm gonna put a couple
[480.32 - 485.55] more pieces in right here
[482.24 - 485.55] [Music]
[486.22 - 489.40] [Applause]
[490.84 - 493.84] so
[495.84 - 499.60] i see it my husband learned in his
[498.00 - 502.48] toxicology class celery
[499.60 - 504.48] is celery is full filled with nitrates
[502.48 - 507.92] not correct
[504.48 - 509.44] sorry it's not correct i wrote a celery
[507.92 - 511.60] juice book
[509.44 - 513.36] all about that and i talked about that
[511.60 - 514.16] in here everything about it and where
[513.36 - 517.28] the confusion
[514.16 - 520.40] fusion lies um that's in celery
[517.28 - 524.00] powder for preserving things
[520.40 - 527.76] and it they add nitrate to it so that's
[524.00 - 529.04] only for the preserving factories for
[527.76 - 531.68] preserving food
[529.04 - 533.12] they they actually take celery powder
[531.68 - 536.96] and they add nitrate
[533.12 - 540.40] to it to try to preserve fish
[536.96 - 540.40] so that's misinformation
[540.48 - 547.04] i've i've actually seen
[543.84 - 551.44] everything about that and then some
[547.04 - 552.88] so i dispute it with facts
[551.44 - 554.64] so here we go i got to show you guys
[552.88 - 556.72] this this is incredible okay
[554.64 - 558.16] this is just absolutely incredible check
[556.72 - 561.12] this out right
[558.16 - 563.28] seriously this blows my mind every time
[561.12 - 565.28] if you guys ever juiced before
[563.28 - 567.12] or juiced with other juicers you're
[565.28 - 569.68] gonna know what this means right here
[567.12 - 571.28] this is this is mind-blowing right okay

[604.96 - 608.16] look at how tiny it is
[606.16 - 609.68] look at this this little dry piece of
[608.16 - 612.16] rope
[609.68 - 614.56] that's the difference right there what
[612.16 - 617.12] this is saving me money wise
[614.56 - 619.28] each year because i juice like 60 ounces

[722.40 - 726.32] this where i'm
[723.52 - 727.36] i'm actually washing kind of scrubbing
[726.32 - 729.76] this here
[727.36 - 730.80] and i use a little tiny bit of natural
[729.76 - 733.04] dish soap
[730.80 - 734.88] in the bowl of water and i kind of rub
[733.04 - 736.96] the sticks that's that's what you do

[738.08 - 742.40] um it's amazing my pulp is always full
[741.68 - 744.56] of juice
[742.40 - 745.60] deanna deanna this is really incredible
[744.56 - 748.64] really
[745.60 - 751.28] um jillian gray says what do you set
[748.64 - 752.56] it on to get the dryness i have an omega
[751.28 - 754.88] but it still comes
[752.56 - 755.92] out quite wet i put the pulp through
[754.88 - 757.92] again that's
[755.92 - 759.68] well doing you have it omega but omega
[757.92 - 760.80] has a bunch of juicers in and that's not
[759.68 - 764.68] this one
[760.80 - 768.16] this is the mm-900
[764.68 - 770.32] hds celery juicer from omega
[768.16 - 772.00] and it uses everything else too this is
[770.32 - 775.20] an entirely different thing they did
[772.00 - 775.52] this because you know they want it to
[775.20 - 777.76] just
[775.52 - 779.44] change people's lives with this i mean
[777.76 - 781.12] no dry to the bone
[779.44 - 782.72] i can't even tell you how i mean this is
[781.12 - 783.68] this is unbelievable and it's only a
[782.72 - 786.48] tiny bit
[783.68 - 787.44] look at that tiny bit for this whole
[786.48 - 790.32] thing right here so
[787.44 - 791.60] um i'm going to actually pour it in i
[790.32 - 794.80] mean honestly
[791.60 - 797.52] every time i do it every morning
[794.80 - 799.28] you're mind blown i mean seriously just
[797.52 - 800.00] mind blown i use a strainer you gotta
[799.28 - 801.76] strain
[800.00 - 803.20] even though you just juiced it you
[801.76 - 806.24] should still strain it
[803.20 - 809.36] should still strain it that that's the
[806.24 - 809.36] best way to do it there
[810.72 - 815.60] it's still the best way to do glad it
[814.00 - 817.04] guys are with me today i'm excited about
[815.60 - 820.16] this so that's it
[817.04 - 820.16] there okay
[820.64 - 824.48] look at that okay incredible and i got
[823.28 - 826.32] this dried out
[824.48 - 827.60] little tiny bit of rope right here now
[826.32 - 831.76] the difference is with that
[827.60 - 833.20] is it can save me like
[831.76 - 836.56] it's in the thousands at the end of the
[833.20 - 839.68] year i buy so many cases of celery
[836.56 - 841.60] and it cut the cost in half
[839.68 - 842.88] just boom this juicer paid for itself
[841.60 - 844.16] over and over
[842.88 - 846.00] and over and over again and guess what
[844.16 - 848.24] this isn't a 700 juicer
[846.00 - 849.20] this isn't a thousand dollar juicer this
[848.24 - 853.12] isn't like
[849.20 - 855.84] a 1500 juicer or a 600 juicer
[853.12 - 856.40] it's on sale it's 200 and something
[855.84 - 858.72] dollars
[856.40 - 859.68] it's it's it's black friday on top of it
[858.72 - 861.60] it just doesn't
[859.68 - 863.44] it just doesn't get any better than that
[861.60 - 866.64] um
[863.44 - 867.44] so uh natalie celery has fast-tracked my
[866.64 - 870.72] healing from
[867.44 - 872.40] graves disease thank you anthony natalie
[870.72 - 873.04] thank you for doing it because when you
[872.40 - 875.52] do it
[873.04 - 877.28] it first of all you know when you
[875.52 - 878.64] actually take that plunge and you're
[877.28 - 880.48] doing your celery juice and you're
[878.64 - 882.32] working on your healing process
[880.48 - 883.60] you become a beacon of light for
[882.32 - 887.28] everybody else
[883.60 - 888.80] and and that's that's powerful powerful
[887.28 - 890.40] because someone else is suffering and
[888.80 - 892.48] struggling and boom

[896.48 - 900.72] you just you just change somebody's like
[898.24 - 902.80] possibly save somebody's life robin
[900.72 - 903.28] young buyer celery juice cleared up all
[902.80 - 905.60] skin
[903.28 - 907.84] issues robin that's incredible because
[905.60 - 909.12] skin is just really brutal brutal for a
[907.84 - 910.56] lot of people and they're really
[909.12 - 912.40] difficult
[910.56 - 913.76] and people really struggle and that
[912.40 - 915.52] that's the best news i've heard
[913.76 - 917.12] really is such good news i'm so happy to
[915.52 - 920.24] hear that
[917.12 - 922.40] so you're really happy to hear that um
[920.24 - 923.04] rita asked does celery have sodium in it
[922.40 - 925.44] yeah it has
[923.04 - 926.56] natural sodium cluster salts a subgroup
[925.44 - 928.56] of sodium
[926.56 - 929.76] that's your medicine that's different
[928.56 - 932.24] than salt
[929.76 - 933.28] that's your medicine it's just
[932.24 - 935.84] incredible
[933.28 - 937.52] but you know yeah michelle aren't aren't
[935.84 - 939.44] skin issues really bad they're so bad
[937.52 - 940.50] people's skin issues are just terrible
[939.44 - 941.68] terrible
[940.50 - 944.48] [Music]
[941.68 - 944.80] so celery juice is one of these things
[944.48 - 946.88] that
[944.80 - 948.00] has benefits beyond what research and
[946.88 - 949.28] science knows first of all they didn't
[948.00 - 952.48] know it had any benefits
[949.28 - 954.72] medical medium information put out
[952.48 - 957.12] information on celery juice okay there
[954.72 - 959.60] was no information on celery juice
[957.12 - 960.80] that existed okay it was all medical
[959.60 - 962.24] medium information
[960.80 - 963.52] and now people are toting it out there
[962.24 - 964.96] everywhere they're saying it does this
[963.52 - 966.56] that does that it does this they don't
[964.96 - 968.00] cite back to medical medium but they'll
[966.56 - 969.28] say it does this this this
[968.00 - 971.12] lower blood pressure do this all the
[969.28 - 972.80] stuff and they don't cite anything back
[971.12 - 974.72] to medical medium they act like
[972.80 - 976.00] there's been real research and studies
[974.72 - 978.48] on it there isn't
[976.00 - 979.76] there hasn't there hasn't been any
[978.48 - 982.64] research
[979.76 - 983.52] and studies on celery juice but guess
[982.64 - 985.44] what
[983.52 - 988.32] millions are healing and reversing
[985.44 - 990.00] disease and symptoms and conditions so
[988.32 - 991.52] let's talk about benefits a little bit
[990.00 - 993.28] that's exciting right there so i got my
[991.52 - 995.12] celery juice just juiced it right here
[993.28 - 998.00] and if you guys just got on here
[995.12 - 999.12] i'm just gonna show you this okay if you
[998.00 - 1002.64] just got on
[999.12 - 1006.16] um because
[1002.64 - 1007.60] i just juiced over 32 ounces of celery
[1006.16 - 1012.24] juice okay
[1007.60 - 1015.04] that's what i did and in this container
[1012.24 - 1016.00] it's it's a joke how much how how little
[1015.04 - 1018.32] is in here
[1016.00 - 1020.48] in this container right here there's
[1018.32 - 1024.32] this little bit in the corner
[1020.48 - 1027.76] look and
[1024.32 - 1031.28] it's dry to the bone that's it
[1027.76 - 1032.80] um i washed all this celery and i don't
[1031.28 - 1034.64] need to juice it
[1032.80 - 1036.80] i'm going to juice it later because i'm
[1034.64 - 1040.08] still going to do some lives
[1036.80 - 1041.12] but is unbelievable so it's just great
[1040.08 - 1042.32] it's great so i want to talk about
[1041.12 - 1045.44] benefits of celery
[1042.32 - 1046.16] i'm going to grab a celery stick right
[1045.44 - 1048.32] here
[1046.16 - 1049.68] um just grab this one this is a great
[1048.32 - 1051.76] celery stick
[1049.68 - 1053.68] so everybody's been asking me to twirl
[1051.76 - 1055.20] the celery sticks
[1053.68 - 1056.72] like in the celery just video on tick
[1055.20 - 1057.92] tock i'm just saying they've always been
[1056.72 - 1058.72] there everybody's asking me can you do
[1057.92 - 1060.32] it again can you
[1058.72 - 1062.32] control it can you twirl it it's pretty
[1060.32 - 1064.00] funny but um anyway
[1062.32 - 1065.68] so the benefits of celery let's just
[1064.00 - 1067.44] talk about about it a little bit there's
[1065.68 - 1070.80] a vitamin c
[1067.44 - 1073.36] in celery okay a vitamin c and
[1070.80 - 1075.60] you can eat the celery sticks but you
[1073.36 - 1078.56] don't get enough of all its medicine
[1075.60 - 1080.32] it's vitamin c it's sodium cluster salts
[1078.56 - 1083.76] and i'll talk about what these things do
[1080.32 - 1086.96] okay um it's phytochemical compounds
[1083.76 - 1088.48] right it it doesn't you can't get enough
[1086.96 - 1089.92] if you eat the sticks
[1088.48 - 1091.84] so somebody like well i'm just gonna eat
[1089.92 - 1094.16] the sticks and be fine with that
[1091.84 - 1094.96] no it's not gonna happen that way you're
[1094.16 - 1096.40] not if
[1094.96 - 1097.84] you if you chop up a little bit of this
[1096.40 - 1099.12] and put it in your tuna salad you're not
[1097.84 - 1100.56] going to get anywhere with it if you
[1099.12 - 1102.40] have this crudite with this
[1100.56 - 1103.92] and you're dipping it in some some ranch
[1102.40 - 1105.68] dressing whatever it is
[1103.92 - 1107.76] you're not going to get you're not going
[1105.68 - 1110.00] to get the benefits if you eat it or
[1107.76 - 1113.60] chop it up in your salad you're still
[1110.00 - 1117.20] not gonna get the benefits you have to
[1113.60 - 1119.60] juice it that's the key you can use and
[1117.20 - 1121.12] you can use whatever juicer you have
[1119.60 - 1122.64] you can use whatever juicer you have if
[1121.12 - 1125.04] you guys got a juicer use it
[1122.64 - 1126.48] okay i'm just showing you a place you
[1125.04 - 1128.72] can go down the road
[1126.48 - 1130.64] with a juicer that can change your life
[1128.72 - 1133.68] for money-wise it can save you
[1130.64 - 1134.16] so much money all of that and and plus
[1133.68 - 1136.24] it's just
[1134.16 - 1137.60] it's cold it's a cold pressed juicer
[1136.24 - 1139.52] it's a cold pressed juicer which is
[1137.60 - 1142.64] amazing on top of it
[1139.52 - 1144.72] so it just it doesn't butcher the celery
[1142.64 - 1146.16] it doesn't butcher it and heat it up and
[1144.72 - 1147.52] butcher it so that's another thing too
[1146.16 - 1149.20] but anyway go back to the benefits a
[1147.52 - 1152.88] little bit all right
[1149.20 - 1156.48] so there's a vitamin c in celery
[1152.88 - 1158.80] that does not have to be converted
[1156.48 - 1160.96] vitamin c has to be converted by your
[1158.80 - 1163.60] liver in order to make it work
[1160.96 - 1165.36] in order for it to actually work it has
[1163.60 - 1167.92] to be converted
[1165.36 - 1168.56] in celery it doesn't have to be that
[1167.92 - 1171.20] means
[1168.56 - 1172.64] that that vitamin c boom goes straight
[1171.20 - 1177.04] to your immune system
[1172.64 - 1180.00] instantly it doesn't go around the bend
[1177.04 - 1180.80] to finally try to get there it doesn't
[1180.00 - 1183.60] have to go
[1180.80 - 1184.16] to the middle man which is your liver
[1183.60 - 1187.28] see
[1184.16 - 1190.24] vitamin c has to go
[1187.28 - 1191.28] to your liver any vitamin c in food so
[1190.24 - 1193.12] any vitamin c
[1191.28 - 1195.20] if you've been taught eat this food
[1193.12 - 1198.48] because it's got vitamin c
[1195.20 - 1201.60] it has to go to the liver first
[1198.48 - 1202.72] get converted and then it can go to your
[1201.60 - 1205.36] immune system
[1202.72 - 1206.56] well here's the difference right here
[1205.36 - 1208.56] right here and you know what you know
[1206.56 - 1210.80] why vitamin c is an important thing
[1208.56 - 1211.84] right now well everybody's locked in
[1210.80 - 1214.40] their homes
[1211.84 - 1216.24] everybody's wearing you know outfits to
[1214.40 - 1218.56] try to protect themselves
[1216.24 - 1220.56] because of what's going down vitamin c
[1218.56 - 1224.16] is critical
[1220.56 - 1226.32] critical to help heal us so what happens
[1224.16 - 1229.20] is this vitamin c in here
[1226.32 - 1231.28] goes straight to your immune system it
[1229.20 - 1231.60] doesn't go to the middle man it doesn't
[1231.28 - 1234.96] go
[1231.60 - 1236.08] to your liver it goes boom right to your
[1234.96 - 1238.32] lymphocytes
[1236.08 - 1239.44] boom right to your monocytes right to
[1238.32 - 1241.36] your neutrophils
[1239.44 - 1244.40] right to your basophils it goes into the
[1241.36 - 1247.12] immune system your white blood count
[1244.40 - 1248.64] gets it immediately and that's a big
[1247.12 - 1251.04] deal right there so i'm just telling you
[1248.64 - 1253.52] how orson vitamin c which is really cool
[1251.04 - 1255.60] and then and then the sodium cluster
[1253.52 - 1258.80] salts that are in celery juice too
[1255.60 - 1261.36] so sodium cluster salts in
[1258.80 - 1262.96] celery juice the subgroup of sodium
[1261.36 - 1264.48] that's undiscovered by research in
[1262.96 - 1267.20] science
[1264.48 - 1268.36] kills off bugs so it starts to kill off
[1267.20 - 1271.44] pathogens
[1268.36 - 1274.64] streptococcus in our system staph
[1271.44 - 1276.00] c diff epstein-barr cytomegalovirus
[1274.64 - 1279.04] herpes simplex 1
[1276.00 - 1281.68] herpes simplex 2 all this stuff
[1279.04 - 1282.40] and it and that sodium cluster salt
[1281.68 - 1285.84] inside
[1282.40 - 1287.20] this this um this this herbal medicine
[1285.84 - 1288.84] because that's what it is it's herbal
[1287.20 - 1292.40] medicine
[1288.84 - 1293.04] goes to the bugs and starts to weaken
[1292.40 - 1294.48] them
[1293.04 - 1296.40] starts to break them down if you got
[1294.48 - 1298.88] acne that's strep
[1296.40 - 1300.96] that's streptococcus if you have acne
[1298.88 - 1303.04] cystic acne is strep in your system and
[1300.96 - 1304.88] it and then your body
[1303.04 - 1306.72] puts all this builds up all the sebum
[1304.88 - 1308.80] oil to try to stop the strep and then it
[1306.72 - 1311.12] becomes nothing but a mess
[1308.80 - 1313.20] and this is good for that that's the
[1311.12 - 1314.40] whole thing in eczema psoriasis that's
[1313.20 - 1316.08] epstein-barr
[1314.40 - 1318.88] and copper inside the liver plus
[1316.08 - 1320.64] epstein-barr bar feeds off a copper
[1318.88 - 1322.40] and then it goes the bathroom then you
[1320.64 - 1323.36] got this dermatoxin well the celery
[1322.40 - 1326.24] juice
[1323.36 - 1327.36] goes into the liver and starts to clean
[1326.24 - 1329.04] up that ebv
[1327.36 - 1330.64] in there starts to break it down a
[1329.04 - 1332.40] little at a time little at a time and

[1485.84 - 1489.84] tools which are helpful too but the
[1487.52 - 1491.60] cellular juice is a big part of how we
[1489.84 - 1493.92] can heal skin issues
[1491.60 - 1495.44] it's a great thing to do um daniel
[1493.92 - 1499.20] vitiligo too
[1495.44 - 1502.24] exactly that's a skin condition vitiligo
[1499.20 - 1504.24] that's having aluminum in your liver so
[1502.24 - 1505.44] celery juice here's another benefit of
[1504.24 - 1508.16] celery juice too
[1505.44 - 1509.76] okay it goes into the liver and it
[1508.16 - 1513.28] starts to clean it up
[1509.76 - 1516.08] it starts to flush it out
[1513.28 - 1517.28] and what's in our liver petrochemicals
[1516.08 - 1519.36] ddt
[1517.28 - 1521.68] herbicides pesticides rodenticides
[1519.36 - 1523.68] insecticides all sit inside our liver
[1521.68 - 1525.44] gasoline from the pumps when you pump
[1523.68 - 1527.36] gas and you're breathing in the fumes
[1525.44 - 1529.60] goes inside the liver plastics
[1527.36 - 1531.08] go inside the liver pharmaceuticals
[1529.60 - 1534.08] antibiotics
[1531.08 - 1535.76] benzodiazepines anti-inflammatories
[1534.08 - 1538.08] any kind of drug or medication you've
[1535.76 - 1538.96] taken throughout your life goes into the
[1538.08 - 1540.96] liver
[1538.96 - 1542.40] thyroid medications go into the liver
[1540.96 - 1545.36] and it gets stagnant
[1542.40 - 1546.48] sluggish and then in that liver is also
[1545.36 - 1548.24] little buggies
[1546.48 - 1549.52] the epstein bar that's a big one that
[1548.24 - 1551.52] sits inside the liver
[1549.52 - 1554.16] so if you have toxic heavy metals in
[1551.52 - 1558.08] there too copper lead arsenic aluminum
[1554.16 - 1561.84] mercury cadmium nickel inside your liver
[1558.08 - 1565.68] that copper and other metals feed
[1561.84 - 1568.40] viruses then a dermatoxin is produced
[1565.68 - 1569.92] and an aluminum-based one for vitiligo
[1568.40 - 1571.76] and you lose your melon and you lose the
[1569.92 - 1572.96] pigment that's how it works celery juice
[1571.76 - 1575.44] goes into the liver
[1572.96 - 1577.36] and it starts to do some healing plus
[1575.44 - 1580.24] it's got phytochemical compounds that
[1577.36 - 1581.76] help heal the skin and i talk about that
[1580.24 - 1582.84] in celery juice book which is really
[1581.76 - 1585.76] cool
[1582.84 - 1587.28] um so yeah
[1585.76 - 1588.80] i'm reading some more comments checking
[1587.28 - 1589.92] things out trying to help in any way i
[1588.80 - 1593.68] can't talk
[1589.92 - 1595.12] dana said darn ebv i know i know it's no
[1593.68 - 1597.28] fun it causes a lot of trouble
[1595.12 - 1598.56] causes the fibromyalgia hashimoto's
[1597.28 - 1600.40] thyroiditis r.a
[1598.56 - 1601.84] lyme disease it causes a lot of trouble
[1600.40 - 1604.32] in a lot of people there's different
[1601.84 - 1607.92] varieties there's over 60 varieties
[1604.32 - 1609.04] of epstein-barr and research and science
[1607.92 - 1610.64] doesn't even know that they thought
[1609.04 - 1611.28] epstein-barr just did this you know what
[1610.64 - 1612.96] they thought
[1611.28 - 1614.64] barr did all these years they thought it
[1612.96 - 1616.48] just made somebody tired
[1614.64 - 1618.64] and gave them a mild fever when they had
[1616.48 - 1620.32] mono that's it that's all they knew
[1618.64 - 1622.08] medical media information and books
[1620.32 - 1623.04] published that epstein-barr causes all
[1622.08 - 1626.32] these conditions
[1623.04 - 1627.84] and guess what a few years later after
[1626.32 - 1629.36] millions of books went into doctor's
[1627.84 - 1632.32] offices uh
[1629.36 - 1633.12] a few years later they decided to say uh
[1632.32 - 1634.88] they think
[1633.12 - 1637.28] now epstein barr is linked to
[1634.88 - 1638.24] hashimoto's they think it's linked now
[1637.28 - 1640.08] to r.a
[1638.24 - 1641.68] they think it's linked now to
[1640.08 - 1643.04] neurological lime
[1641.68 - 1645.04] for medical medium information it's
[1643.04 - 1645.84] pretty pretty amazing really what's
[1645.04 - 1648.24] happened
[1645.84 - 1650.32] and it's really great it's really great
[1648.24 - 1653.76] um can we give
[1650.32 - 1656.32] the wildlife celery juice
[1653.76 - 1657.60] because of chemtrails is that i think

[1663.36 - 1667.20] pieces of celery and squirrels eaten
[1667.60 - 1672.40] out there for squirrels um and i think
[1670.88 - 1673.44] the question i think was confused by the
[1672.40 - 1674.72] question or the con
[1673.44 - 1677.92] the question probably a little different
[1674.72 - 1679.60] than what it looks like um
[1677.92 - 1681.12] yeah ingrid you could use limes instead
[1679.60 - 1682.72] of lemon i just saw that
[1681.12 - 1684.48] in your lemon water you can have lime
[1682.72 - 1684.96] water if you really need to that's okay
[1684.48 - 1688.56] too
