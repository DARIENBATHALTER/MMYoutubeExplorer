in your seat belt it's because on an

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,640
emotional level of just getting in touch

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,159
a seat belt Fastener so I I kind of

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,560
would do that would relax and get some

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,000
herbal tea or something and chill out a

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,479
little bit and just uh find a

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,040
comfortable space somewhere in the house

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,439

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,439
gone through anything anything anything

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,680
challenging any kind of struggle any

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,640
kind of difficulty any kind of adversity

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,680
in life any kind of

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,799
Challenge and confrontation just in

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,719
general with anything around us it

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,640
struggles and hardships losses all of

40
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:52,200
this this show really is about all of

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,320
that and about who we become when we're

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,479
when we're pushed to this degree of

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,000
whatever it may be and especially in

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,119
chronic illness especially in chronic

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,240
illness look when we're sick and we

46
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,439
don't feel good and we we don't feel

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,399
well and that could range from anything

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,599
from getting an answer from a doctor

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
after going to 10 doctors whether the

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,800
answer is right or wrong or we have a

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,959
label or don't have a label or we have

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,280
mystery symptoms that aren't getting

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,720
diagnosed and they don't make sense to

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,560
anyone and they get in a way in our life

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,640
and makes us feel like we're diminishing

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,160
in our life we're aging before our time

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,080
even if it's a simple th problem even if

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,319
it's a um um um condition like crippling

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,640
anxiety and we feel like something's

60
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,440
going on and we're aging and and we're

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,239
not getting answers or we're not being

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,800
able to perform our best we're not we're

63
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,000
not able to do our best and we feel like

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,400
everybody else around us maybe they're

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,480
they're able to do what they need to do

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,840
you know I always say like the reindeer

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,319
can all play and and there's he can't

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,360
play in the reindeer games when you're

69
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,000
challenged with some kind of chronic

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,040
illness or some kind of struggle in that

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,680
way so and there's there's millions of

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
people yes they have these struggles and

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,440
they have these physical struggles and

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,840
these different symptoms like maybe a

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,120
severe depression or a mild depression

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
maybe a

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
fatigue a fatigue that's unex you know

78
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,920
unexplainable that we don't get answers

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
for it of course we talk about all the

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,159
answers for those things in in these

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,560
shows on the medical medium radio shows

82
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,760
but what happens is though we tend to

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,120
feel more insecure when we get an

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,319
illness or a symptom or a condition we

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,200
feel more insecure we lose confidence we

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,000
lose

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,319
confidence and and it's really it's

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,040
really it's a challenging thing all on

89
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,360
its own to lose confidence confidence

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,400
that you once had or confidence that you

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,280
know you grew up with building and

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,439
getting instilled inside of you

93
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,319
and then all of a sudden something that

94
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,360
doesn't make sense at all and I've seen

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,599
this happen to younger people younger

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,480
people they they've they they're doing

97
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,879
they're you know they're living life

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,640
they're going through school they're

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,919
going through middle school high school

100
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,560
something happens where they're starting

101
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,120
to get sick nobody has any answers or

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
maybe they just get funneled into the

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Lyme disease trap where now it's just

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,199
all Lyme disease even though that's

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,880
really not what's going on and so you

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,560
know it's it's this whole thing that

107
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,800
occurs and then and then it's like hey

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,639
wait a minute what about my future and a

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,759
lot of young people they get they get

110
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,360
scared and it their confidence just

111
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,199
starts to wne and waxes and wanes and

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,199
just starts to diminish and then

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
insecurities can build up and then PTSD

114
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,160
post-traumatic stress disorder

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,759
post-traumatic stress syndrome you know

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,160
it's just it just it starts to it starts

117
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,440
to then compile and then anything from

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,400
obsessive compulsive disorder can

119
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,720
develop like OCD because when you get

120
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,440
sick and and and the ground you're

121
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,880
standing on doesn't feel so sturdy and

122
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,600
strong we tend to you know we tend to

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
lose balance and he can even have a

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,840
symptom of balance loss where you got

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,520
the vertigo and everything else but even

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,720
with any symptom any condition your

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,280
footing just isn't feeling like it's as

128
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,039
strong as it is the confidence isn't

129
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,479
there a lot of the young people suffer

130
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,360
from migraines and then there's older

131
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,880
people that are still young of course

132
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,280
and then there's people that just when

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,479
you get in the groove you're getting

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,600
your career right you know everything's

135
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:46,000
falling pieces are falling in to place

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,240
in your life and you're you're feeling

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,759
better than ever and more confident than

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,680
ever and all of a sudden you know you're

139
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,120
in your late 30s and all of a sudden

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,160
something happens and we're getting an

141
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,479
illness out of nowhere and we're going

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,199
to doctor to doctor and it's just it's

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,759
just hit us in all these different ways

144
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,280
all at the wrong times whether we're

145
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,560
about to have a child or whether we

146
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,039
already have two children or three

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,319
children or one child and we're trying

148
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,479
to make ends meet and we're trying to be

149
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,080
you know we're trying to handle

150
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,639
everything and be responsible about

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
everything and now we're dealing with a

152
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,280
condition or a chronic

153
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,560
illness and you feel like you can't take

154
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,720
I've seen this I've seen this with so

155
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,479
many people I've seen this with people

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,560
in their late 20s and their late 30s

157
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,479
they can't even take care of their

158
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,160
children the way they would want to they

159
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,479
struggle to do so take care of their

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,319
families they have problems with their

161
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,919
spouses their partners because when

162
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
someone's sick it's not easily

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,639
understood especially if you've been the

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,240
rock all those years and all of a sudden

165
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,759
you're sick I mean there's so many

166
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,560
different

167
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,440
experiences or different you know

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,840
situations there's so many examples of

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,919
what I know you guys go through and so

170
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,919
many others do and I know it and you're

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,160
not alone you're not alone I do know

172
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,759
that you're not alone because

173
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,919
there's lots and lots of people going

174
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,520
through this and here's here's the thing

175
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,440
here's the thing so at different ages it

176
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,919
can hit and when it hits younger when

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
you're just starting life it feels like

178
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,199
you're just getting you're getting going

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
maybe you're coming out of college and

180
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,720
then all of a sudden you don't feel good

181
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,280
you got all these different symptoms you

182
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,440
have crippling anxiety you got

183
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,080
fatigue it's really difficult it's

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,440
really difficult it can hit you at your

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,639
core right in the heart hit you at the

186
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,199
core right in the soul right in the soul

187
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,560
and same thing if you're in your 40s

188
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,360
could be early 40s mid 40s late

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,680
40s where you've worked so hard in your

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,800
life trying to build what you've been

191
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
building and then all of a sudden now

192
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,520
you're spending all this time and all

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,840
this time just about your sickness or

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
just about your illness or just about

195
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,560
your symptoms and that happens at all

196
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,879
ages young people too they're spending

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,000
all this time thinking about their

198
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,280
symptoms and thinking about their

199
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,800
conditions and what they're eating and

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,560
it could be maddening and it could be

201
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,319
maddening and so it it it these

202
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,639
are struggles these are

203
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,319
struggles and these are serious

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,919
struggles and they challenge us and they

205
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,800
challenge us and they touch our

206
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,520
soul and they shape our

207
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,440
soul they shape our

208
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,399
soul and it could happen at any age

209
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,080
could be in your 50s and in your 50s

210
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,240
you're you're a grandmother or you're a

211
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,000
grandfather now and you're looking

212
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,440
forward you've worked your whole life

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,360
you're working forward to spending time

214
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,080
with your grandchildren you're looking

215
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,320
forward you're in your 60s you're

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,240
looking forward to spend time with your

217
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,120
grandchildren and and do different

218
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,600
things maybe start going places and

219
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,920
doing stuff that you never thought you

220
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,720
would that you waited your whole life to

221
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,440
do and you start getting sick and that

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,480
happens

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,000
too it hits at any age it hits at any

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,360
age it really does but I notice when it

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,640
hits at the younger ages when it hits at

226
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,079
the younger

227
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,720
ages something

228
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,519
happens to the soul to truly shape and

229
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,600
something happens to your being and your

230
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,640
growth and your spiritual growth like no

231
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,959
other and it can like I it can happen

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
like that you could spiritually grow

233
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,240
still being hit with anything when

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,279
you're in your 50s absolutely I've seen

235
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,560
people and it hits them then because

236
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,160
what happens is when when you get

237
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,320
challenged with something on this level

238
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,000
with the chronic illness or symptoms and

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
conditions or a diagnosed chronic

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,399
illness or whatever it is and you get

241
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,959
challenged with

242
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,720
it something occurs the weight and the

243
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,800
pressure of the challenge the weight and

244
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,640
the pressure does something spiritually

245
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,560
it causes spiritual growth like no other

246
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,880
spiritual growth can

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,320
create no other spiritual growth can

248
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,240
create and this even happens with losses

249
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,720
so it's not even just chronic illness

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,839
and and a lot of people with chronic

251
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
illness you guys and I'm sure you know a

252
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,279
lot of people with chronic illness still

253
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,399
have to deal with

254
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,959
losses and struggles on that

255
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,920
level and and breaks breakups with

256
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,160
relationships I've seen that happen all

257
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,880
on its own with

258
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,880
soulmates with you know I've seen young

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,360
married couples break up because someone

260
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,480
got ill so early on where it just didn't

261
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,560
suit the needs of one of the members in

262
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,519
the in the group there it's usually

263
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,360
usually for the most part women get they

264
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,920
they get the symptoms and they they get

265
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,680
sick men do too men do too young men do

266
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,519
too but mostly more women do and then

267
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,760
usually the guys are like whoa I'm only

268
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,519
24 I thought were engaged to be married

269
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,560
I this is definitely getting weird what

270
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
do you mean Hashimoto thyroiditis what

271
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,480
do you mean Lyme disease what what do

272
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,600
you mean possible rheumatoid arthritis

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
what do you mean lupus that's scary what

274
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,519
about my children that happens with a

275
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
lot of young people and they all get

276
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,920
scared and they all get scared and many

277
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,279
relationships they do stay together

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
through that process and they work

279
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,639
through and a lot of them disband

280
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,079
because of the confusion and the fear

281
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,480
and the and the just all part of it and

282
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,320
then you have losses on top of an

283
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,040
illness so maybe that's some maybe some

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,480
of you have experienced that there's so

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,200
many different levels that happen you

286
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,760
can have the losses you can have that

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,000
part in the struggles and you can have

288
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
the hardships and you can still have the

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,920
sickness and still have the illness and

290
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,200
that can be the hardships all on their

291
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,880
own is an illness and a symptom and a

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,959
condition and a chronic illness of any

293
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,560
kind that alone can be a struggle and

294
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,959
and a hardship all on its

295
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,959
own and when we're living like this when

296
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:00,399
we're living like this we our lives have

297
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,399
to change in Altar and Order in order to

298
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,279
sustain ourselves we have to fight like

299
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:09,279
nobody ever fought before we have to

300
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,360
wake up every day you know I always say

301
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,600
the athletes out there the athletes and

302
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,040
I've known some athletes that worked

303
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,120
every single day all they would work out

304
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,440
all day long they would push themselves

305
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,600
to the Limit whether they were they were

306
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,399
Runners whether they did other things

307
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,199
whether they were anybody snowboarders

308
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,720
whatever it was that they the Olympic

309
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:36,560
athletes push themselves like no other

310
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,800
and that doesn't compare that doesn't

311
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,920
compare to when you're chronically ill

312
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,199
and you wake up in the morning and I

313
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,440
have all the respect in the world for

314
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,760
athletes you better believe it but it

315
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,800
doesn't compare to when you wake up in

316
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,160
the morning and you have to push through

317
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,839
an illness because your all your mindset

318
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,079
all your mental capacity all your focus

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,800
is on what doctors am I seeing now where

320
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,880
am I going what is my practitioner say

321
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,199
what do I do what is it working is it

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,120
not working what do I eat how do I start

323
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,160
my day do I take this supplement do I

324
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,040
take this drug how do I live my life

325
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,880
what do I tell my family today how I'm

326
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,079
feeling who whatever how's my friends

327
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,760
are they even listening to me anymore

328
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:20,680
all this stuff and then some and then

329
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,360
whatever else is compiling onto all of

330
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,600
it because I'm chronically all of that

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:31,519
all of that is harder harder training

332
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,839
harder training than any Olympic Athlete

333
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,240
does all the sweat all the sweat that an

334
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,720
Olympic Athlete does and I know Olympic

335
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm friends with Olympic athletes they

336
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
they're they're not upset when they hear

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,399
this because I'll tell you why in a

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,120
minute I'll tell you why I'll tell you

339
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:50,600
why and so all that sweat all that all

340
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,560
that grind that those athletes do and

341
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,720
they work out day in and day out and day

342
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
in and day out and they're building

343
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,920
muscle and they're pushing through and

344
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,680
they're doing what they got to

345
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,360
do all of that

346
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,199
doesn't even

347
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,120
touch what chronic illness sufferers do

348
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:11,160
as far as

349
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,800
athletically what they do mentally

350
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,639
emotionally what they do even physically

351
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,040
to push through an illness even just

352
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,160
simple unexplainable chronic fatigue we

353
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,920
know what causes all the different

354
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,600
chronic fatigues all of them all the

355
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,199
different labels of chronic

356
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,320
fatigue we know but but the point is is

357
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,079
even just pushing through that fatigue

358
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,160
pushing through all of that that is

359
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:41,399
harder that takes something else that

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,720
takes some kind of spiritual growth it

361
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:48,639
takes Soul power like none other

362
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,000
anywhere possible it takes Soul power

363
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,160
more so than if you're a cliff climber

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,240
if you climb Cliffs and You Freestyle

365
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,320
them and you climb them because that

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,279
because what happens is that kind of

367

372
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,800
sure I know what I'm talking

373
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,040

375
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,279
they work hard and they work hard what

376
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,839
happens is I've known Olympic athletes

377
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,160
that got chronically ill out of nowhere

378
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,319

episode or um or just a really bad flu

382
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,360
and pneumonia or something like I'm not

383
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,040
talking about that I'm talking about a

384
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,959
chronic illness where they got weak in

385
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
the limbs where they were getting MRIs

386
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,319
Non-Stop and CAT scans Non-Stop and

387
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,759
doctors didn't even know what was going

388
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:54,480
on and they saw neurologist and there

389
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,480
were no answers and all of a sudden now

390
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,279
it wasn't about them working out anymore

391
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,199
it was about them trying to find answers

392
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,480
to an illness or they were getting

393
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,480
crippling anxiety on top of weak Limbs

394
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,920
and and and and and an illness coming on

395
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,000
have know Olympic athletes have gone

396
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,839
through this and they' had no answers

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,240
and I've had to help them and recover

398
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,759
them and they even said I've known a few

399
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,279
of them that have gone through illnesses

400
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,519
they said you know they were traveling

401
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,759
overseas it just happened out of nowhere

402
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,319
they just thought they were exhausted

403
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,839
and tired and never went away the

404
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,319
doctors had no

405
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,920
answers and they lost their Olympic

406
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,160
career they lost their chances there in

407
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,959
that moment at that time where they lost

408
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
that one chance for a gold medal but

409
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,480
they fought their way back but we had to

410
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
get their chronic illness better just

411
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,959
like we're getting everybody else's

412
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,240
chronic illness just like we're working

413
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,959
on it just like the information in the

414
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,079
books it's out there just like the shows

415
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,240
we're going to get you guys better

416
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,360
overall over time we're going to do it

417
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,639
one day at a time but what happens is

418
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,319
what I heard from them was the chronic

419
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,480
illness was something it was a whole

420
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,160
different spiritual bill it was a

421
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,240
building of spiritual power they've

422
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,760
never had before and soul it was a it

423
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,959
was a challenge on the

424
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,839
soul like no other that they've ever had

425
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,839
to

426
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,000
endure they suddenly had respect for

427
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,520
people who couldn't work out at

428
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,520
all respect for people that couldn't

429
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,760
work out at all that couldn't get off

430
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,439
their bed couldn't get off their couch

431
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
because of an illness because of

432
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
swelling in their body because of

433
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,480
inflammation because of of chronic

434
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
fatigue because of all kinds of

435
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,919
different neurological symptoms because

436
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
of everything because of anything they

437
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,400
couldn't get off the couch they couldn't

438
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,679
function and they all of a sudden had

439
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,919
respect it wasn't about get your butt

440
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,840
off the couch and start working out you

441
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
can do it what do you mean you're sick

442
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
your doctor gave you a medication you

443
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
should be fine you went to the doctor

444
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,600
they gave you some diagnosis they gave

445
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,799
you medication you should be back up and

446
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,240
exercising you should be doing your

447
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,400
weights and weightlifting they didn't

448
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,600
have that attitude anymore it was gone

449
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,520
that attitude was just

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,080
gone one one athlete said to me he was

451
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,960
ashamed because he knew somebody with

452
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,960
chronic

453
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,919
illness and he thought just go to the

454
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,240
damn doctor and that's what a lot of

455
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,840
normal healthy people or it doesn't mean

456
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,159
they're totally healthy inside no

457
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,159
because everybody could have a ticking

458
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,559
time bomb in them at any time if they're

459
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,400
not taking care of themselves sure you

460
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,760
can get sick but and you're taking care

461
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,000
of yourself you can beat sickness and

462
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,799
override it and move forward it never

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,200
gets sick again but the point is the

464
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
bottom line is when you know what's

465
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,159
wrong and you know what to do yes you

466
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,960
can when you know what to do for it you

467
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,000
know what's wrong you can you can heal

468
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,919
but this athlete felt terrible was

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,400
ashamed because knew a chronic person

470
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,760
with chronic illness and was like get

471
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,400

473
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,080

474
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,679
good go to the doctor the doctor knows

475
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,080
the doctor has all the information you

476
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,880
go to the doctor and the athlete also

477
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,720
said said to me he remembers when he

478
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,400
hurt his Achilles heel for a little bit

479
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,720
it healed up it was just a small injury

480
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,080
he was off the foot for a while and he

481
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,000
just kept on doing weights and other

482
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
kinds of exercises he

483
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
said he said to the person I've had

484
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
something wrong with me I had an

485
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,240
Achilles heel problem I persevered

486
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,320
through it I I pumped weights I did what

487
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,559
I did it healed the doctor healed it he

488
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,320
casted it up everything was back I had a

489
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,400
little PT physical therapy and I was

490
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,280
perfectly fine and he told his chronic

491
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,760
illness so what's your excuse go to the

492
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,679
doctor this chronic illness person says

493
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,360
I got this fatigue and once I start

494
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,679
doing anything every single thing hurts

495
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,440
in my body to such a degree that I can't

496
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
even do anything anymore and it makes me

497
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,200
worse and then three days I'm three four

498
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,320
five days in bed because of it and he

499
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,400
said that he just thought it was all an

500
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,159
excuse he felt terrible when he got

501
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,559
sick terrible he felt terrible about

502
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:56,600
being sick he had to learn what building

503
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,039
that soul and spiritual power really was

504
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,760
he told me he knew about people you know

505
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,280
who felt fell fine and didn't have any

506
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,640
real illnesses or symptoms and

507
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,799
conditions and they would go and travel

508
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
up some mountains they would climb a

509
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,200
mountain it' be a spiritual experience

510
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
and they would sit on the mountain top

511
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,120
and look out at the heavens look out at

512
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,559
the sky and they would just you know

513
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,600
they would just

514
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,200
literally they would be like putting

515
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,679
their hands together they'd be praying

516
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,039
they would be looking for spiritual

517
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,720
growth he said he knew people like that

518
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,159
that have done that and he said

519
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,159
that spiritual

520
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,240
growth wasn't anything compared to what

521
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,080
he had to suffer and go through when he

522
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,039
had chronic illness and he had to fight

523
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,760
to get better it was nothing like he's

524
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,480
ever experienced before he said it was a

525
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,640
lot harder a lot harder than just going

526
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,840
to the gym and sweating and sweating and

527
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,559
building muscle and staying diligent and

528
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,559
staying and staying competitive and

529
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,200
complying and complying and stating

530
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:59,039
staying competitive he said there was

531
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:04,120
nothing that was a joke it was a

532
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,880
joke compared to when he got sick and he

533
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,799
he couldn't even turn his head he'd get

534
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,200
a spasm and didn't even know why and the

535
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,240
doctors were throwing their hands up in

536
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
the air saying oh maybe you got lime

537
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,200
let's send the labs out maybe you got

538
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,799
this maybe you got multiple sclerosis

539
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,840
maybe you got something else and here's

540
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,480
a drug try this and try that he was

541
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,320
slowly or quickly I'm sorry quickly

542
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,960
learning how flawed the medical system

543
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,840
was in chronic illness he said Anthony

544
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,320
you've been telling me that for years

545
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,559
we've been friends and I always

546
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,039
respected what you did as the medical

547
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,840
medium he said I always respected what

548
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,840
you did but I never understood who you

549
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,480
worked on I never really understood who

550
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,919
you really worked

551
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,679
on because I know you've worked on a lot

552
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
of people and I know you worked on all

553
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,520
kinds of people and then all around the

554
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,960
world and all walks of life but and who

555
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,880
You'

556
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,200
helped but what happened was he realized

557
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,600
how flawed the system was he realized

558
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,720
how flawed science and research was he

559
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,360
realized how hard you have to fight and

560
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,120
the mountain you have to climb surpasses

561
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,960
the mountains that people have climbed

562
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,600
and sat on doing their prayers and

563
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
meditations which is a beautiful thing

564
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,000
nothing wrong with that if you guys have

565
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,440
an opportunity to do that that's

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,279
exciting but that spiritual growth he

567
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,840
said didn't even touch the spiritual

568
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,000
growth he had to face he had to face

569
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,080
himself he had to face fear he had to

570
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,679
face his confidence that he built up his

571
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,400
whole life he had to face everything

572
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,360
insecurities that he didn't even know

573
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,640
existed filtered it and came in and they

574
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,799
taunted him like demons and they they

575
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,640
literally ripped him the

576
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,600
shreds as he realized Not only was the

577
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,360
system flawed Not only was it was like

578
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,679
sand falling through his hands as he was

579
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,520
chronically sick and exploring every

580
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,400
Avenue possible and then coming to me

581
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,120
and begging for me for help help and I

582
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,600
gave him that

583
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,240
help and he

584
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,480
recovered and he said I swear to God I

585
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,760
will never ever ever ever ever look at

586
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,240
another person who's chronically sick or

587
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,480
has a simple symptom or has one symptom

588
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,520
in the way I looked at them before I

589
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,919
will never ever ever I have the most

590
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,320
compassion the deepest respect he said

591
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
to anyone who has ever struggled because

592
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,120
I've had to live through it myself and I

593
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,000
said it's too bad though it's too bad I

594
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,039
said it's too bad and he says what do

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,520
you mean it's too bad that you got to

596
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,320
experience it to see it I just wish

597
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,840
people that were feeling good or good

598
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,080
enough to function in their lives would

599
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,360
not have to

600
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,880
experience what people are going through

601
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,960
on that level to respect it he just said

602
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,679
I know I know what you're saying it's a

603
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
see it to believe it World you've said

604
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,480
that to me before it's a see it to

605
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
believe it it's it's only real If you

606
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,360
experience it I know you've told me that

607
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,279
all this time and I know I'm cliche to

608
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,520
what you've said and it's true I've

609
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,200
experienced it i' I've had to see it to

610
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,799
believe it but I'm telling you now

611
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,279
Anthony I will never look at another

612
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,960
person who's who's dealing with

613
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,799
something the way in the light I've seen

614
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,559
before because when I'm in the gym now

615
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,240
and I'm trying to prepare for the next

616
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,279
round of Olympics for that next Olympic

617
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,279
day and that NE next Olympic gold and

618
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,320
silver and bronze and I'm trying to

619
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,520
prepare to get that I still know it's

620
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,399
chump change compared to what other

621
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,000
people are going through you taught me

622
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,360
that I lived it I learned it myself and

623
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
it's chump change is what it

624
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,840
is that's that's that's that's

625
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
true I said to him it's true it is chump

626
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,120
change it is and I said look I got

627
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,159
respect for what you do working out as

628
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,240
and and to that degree training and that

629
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:59,159
having that kind of having that kind of

630
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:02,320
religious religious compl Appliance to

631
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,399
training like you do I know that that's

632
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,360
a gift all on its own and it is a gift

633
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:09,039
and I'm not disrespecting that at all on

634
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
any level on anywhere I'm not

635
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,559
disrespecting that at

636
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,720
all but it's true it's chump

637
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,520
change to what chronically sick people

638
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,399
have to endure to heal and rise out of

639
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:29,159
the Ashes to rise out of the ashes

640
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:31,880
that's rising out of the ashes like no

641
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,440
other it's an entirely different

642
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,480
challenge than working up a

643
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,520
sweat than working up sweat daily and

644
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:45,039
training and whatever sport or whatever

645
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,600
venue you're in whatever that may be

646
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,080
that doesn't touch what people have to

647
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,279
do when they're chronically

648
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,600
ill and you know what happens when

649
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:56,919
you've been through symptoms and

650
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,480
conditions and you've been through strug

651
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,080
struggles and hard times and you've been

652
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,960
challenged and you've been pushed to the

653
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,200
Limit and pushed to the max you know

654
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,240
what happens it's a weight it's pressure

655
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,960
and it's a weight and that pressure and

656
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:15,960
weight does something it's heavy it's so

657
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,679
heavy we need we need to make it light

658
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,880
and Airy and we can with

659
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,760
truth that pressure and that heaviness

660
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,919
that we bear that monkey on our back

661
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,520
that gorilla on our back that we bear

662
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,559
that giant

663
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,480
knapsack of rocks and stones that we

664
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,880
walk around with when we're struggling

665
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
with the symptom and condition when

666
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
we're fighting for our lives when we're

667
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,440
fighting for sanity when we're fighting

668
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,720
the demons when we're fighting

669
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,799
everything and we're we're dealing with

670
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,600
also loved ones that don't understand or

671
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,039
maybe understand but don't we deal with

672
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,480
all the things we deal with friends we

673
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,559
find out who our friends are really are

674
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,720
and who they're not and whatnot and we

675
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,080
just forge ahead and we have to forgive

676
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,600
everybody and we have to have

677
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
forgiveness and we have to train

678
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,880
ourselves to have forgiveness and we

679
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,240
have to tap into that heart and soul for

680
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,919
that forgiveness you know I often hear

681
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,440
out there about

682
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,120

that have suffered and fought their way

got to forgive yourself but you got to

716
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,600
forgive yourself with a level of

717
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,519
compassion you have to forgive yourself

718
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,880
with a level of comp

719
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,360

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,480
them I have to forgive myself I have to

731
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,120
have compassion for myself I have to pet

732
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,159
myself on the back with everything I

733
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,919
have I have to have compassion for

734
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,360
myself to push through this and get

735
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,760
through this

736
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,679
and fight through it and rise out of the

737
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,360
ashes and fight through my illness and

738
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,200
get through this chronic situation and

739
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,640
get these symptoms behind us so I can

740
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,200
behind me so I can move forward forward

741
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,679
with life in other ways that I haven't

742
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,799
been able to do it because I've been

743
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,240
stifled and held back and haven't been

744
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,960
able to push

745
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,120
through and I need to do that and I need

746
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,960
to get that done but I I'm working on it

747
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,720
with everything I have but my chronic

748
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,440
illness holds me back holds me back but

749
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,480
let me tell you something it's holding

750
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,880
you back but it's creating something

751
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,080
like never before inside of you it is

752
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,080
building something like never before

753
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,640
inside of you it

754
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,640
is something changes within you it's not

755
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
just the Forgiveness of two others that

756
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,080
don't understand or whether they

757
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,039
understand or

758
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,600
not God bless them it's not just that

759
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,279
it's not just the Forgiveness to

760
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,840
yourself and having that compassion to

761
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,120
yourself which is critical you have to

762
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,519
have compassion for yourself it's not

763
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,240
even that something builds in the soul

764
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,360
something happens in the soul that could

765
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
not happen in lifetimes that could not

766
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,640
happen

767
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,840
otherwise that doesn't happen otherwise

768
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
it won't happen for someone who just

769
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,039
lived their life Fancy free with really

770
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,799
no challenges all the way to the end and

771
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,320
just passed away later later later on

772
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:25,799
their soul won't be like

773
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,360
yours no it won't and everybody's soul

774
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,840
is different I know that that's not what

775
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
what I'm saying everybody's soul is

776
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,039
different I'm saying something bigger

777
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
than that I'm saying something bigger

778
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,480
than all our souls are different I'm

779
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,799
saying when you're pushed to the Max and

780
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,000
you're pushed at a level like this and

781
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,320
you've been through struggles and you

782
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,720
had the symptoms and conditions and

783
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,679
you've gone through the losses and the

784
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,399
struggles all all over emotional and

785
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:50,279
physical all of it what happens is your

786
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:53,679
soul your soul

787
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:58,039
changes like no

788
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:01,159
other it becomes gold like no other

789
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:04,000
true gold it's your Soul's gold I'm

790
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:08,639
talking about it's your Soul's riches

791
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,480
it's your Soul's value it changes in

792
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:14,720
every way

793
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:19,000
possible it it goes above and rises

794
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:23,240
above all the gold medals anyone can win

795
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,840
it rises above all the solid gold medals

796
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,799
it rises above Treasure of all Treasures

797
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,120
it's more than just diamonds and

798
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:34,519
emeralds and rubies it's more than just

799
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,919
all the platinum and gold and silver

800
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,840
it's more than all of that because it

801
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,960
has a spiritual meaning within it and

802
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,840
inside of it that's built inside your

803
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,480
soul like none other can ever touch in

804
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,559
any spiritual

805
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,559
Endeavor in any spiritual

806
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,880
Endeavor you know I've known I I I've

807
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,760
known a woman before and and I still do

808
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,200
I just haven't we haven't spoken a long

809
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,240
time we speak every I think it's like

810
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:09,600
every four or five years she contacts me

811
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,760
and she says hey how you doing I miss

812
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,120

813
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,399
H I don't know about saving the world

814
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,919

trying to help everybody and you we talk

816
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,960
a little bit and everything like that we

817
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,960
met a long time ago because she had this

818
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,760
this experience a religious experience a

819
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,120
spiritual experience

820
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,880
she was in a car she was in a

821
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,960
car and that car

822
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,080
crashed and that car was

823
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,039
mangled it was

824
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,840
mangled and when she was in that car

825
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:48,559
when she was in that car she had a

826
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,000
premonition that it was going to crash

827
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,360
there was no signs of that there were

828
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,679
nothing in the way there was nothing

829
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,440
going on there was nothing happening she

830
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,000
had a premonition it hit her the car is

831
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,760
going to crash

832
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,200
the car is going to

833
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,279
crash and she was she was like what do I

834
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:11,039
do is this real she she felt like it was

835
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,639
just like something just told her and

836
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,279
she couldn't tell if she heard it she

837
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,200
thought it she felt it she said it was

838
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,880
all the above she felt it she heard it

839
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,720
she felt the whole

840
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,159
bit

841
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,200
and well the car

842
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:29,360
crashed and there was a few cars

843
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,320
involved and the outcome was was

844
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,639
horrific she was trapped in the car they

845
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,480
had to cut her out of the

846
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:39,720
car when they did they were positive

847
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,559
there was going to be really nothing

848
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,080
left of her when they cut her out of the

849
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,120
car she stood

850
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,399
up she took a

851
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,000
walk and it was like she never even was

852
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,840
touched she was never even

853
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,519
touched it was no one could believe it

854
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,080
Emergency Services didn't it was

855
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,200
unexpected

856
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,080
explainable and what happened was that

857
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,519
voice she heard a voice she heard was

858
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,800
what she believes was an

859
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,520
angel that's what she believes she's

860
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,320
positive it was an angel because it

861
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,760
could be nothing else in her mind and

862
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,399
everything

863
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
else but she walked away with spiritual

864
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,520
growth and she walked

865
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,800
away with something

866
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,079
something it changed her life she was a

867
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,800
different person she said she was always

868
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,119
short kind of nasty and mean she felt

869
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,960
before that

870
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,520
experience she felt that she was not her

871
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,159
best self she felt she was even kind of

872
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,280
always had a jealousy about other people

873
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,639
and kind of purposely would do things

874
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,280
that she felt that she knew was

875
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,040
bad but we're all human we make mistakes

876
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,000
we do that and I I said to that I said

877
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,560
look whatever people you're good you're

878
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,520
a good person we people do things they

879
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,839
just do things she said yeah but it was

880
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,760
I wasn't a good person Anthony I wasn't

881
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,240
a good person when I came when I climbed

882
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,359
out when they pulled me out of that car

883
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,480
and I would walked around like nothing

884
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,720
happened and there wasn't even a scratch

885
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,000
on

886
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,920
me and and one of the one of the

887
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,440
responders said there's no question she

888
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,839
has both broken legs in there the way

889
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,160
they were Twisted in there and the metal

890
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,040
was compiled I said just the the legs

891
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,280
couldn't even be bent that way they said

892
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,560
it's not even possible so they were

893
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,359
expecting there was nothing wrong with

894
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,280
her she got out she was like she was

895
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,839
like a rubber band in

896
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,040
there and protected as if her body

897
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:41,440
turned into jelly and then just reformed

898
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,359
and shape shifted out of it she said

899
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,640
that she said that one of her family

900
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,359
members one of her cousins got ill with

901
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,880
a chronic illness and this was after the

902
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:53,440
fact after this experience after this

903
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,560
religious experience after the spiritual

904
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,520
experience after the soul

905
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,720
Experience One one of her family

906
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,880
members I think was her first cousin

907
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,280
fell ill with a chronic illness and she

908
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,760
decided to devote her time with her

909
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,680
family member because she was a changed

910
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,920
person after her experience in every way

911
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,319
and she walked the walk with this family

912
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,000
member and took her to all the doctor

913
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,839

Soul like none other that her experience

touch the experience that she had in

935
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,440
that car wreck pulling out of there and

urve from it she saw every bit of

945
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,079
confusion she saw where science and

946
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,520
research completely fell short of of

947
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,960
even helping her she saw it all and she

948
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,480
said that right there that right there

949
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,000
and living through that and what she

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,640
through said was like a thousand car

952
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,960
accidents with a Thousand Angels in the

car and walking away way completely

954
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,520
changed as a changed person a thousand

955
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,599
times over still she felt didn't compare

956
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,520
or touch what the Soul's goal that built

957
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,240
up in this person her cousin's Soul was

958
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,720
built up with the gold and the treasure

959
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,800

969
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,440
went through and the soul of her changed

970
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,520
and she watched it from when the cousin

971
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,880
fell ill all the way going year after

972
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,319
year and she stayed with her cousin

973
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,400
strong and she took care of her and she

974
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:54,920
helped her along the way and she said

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,680

souls gold you're talking

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,079
about it's it's a compilation a

988
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,920
compilation

989
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,560
of the jewels of struggle and the gems

990
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,839
of

991
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,240
loss and the Diamonds of hardship and

992
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:40,079
the platinum and the

993
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,720
gold of that of of the struggle in

994
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,000
nature of the hardship of it all and the

995
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,640
loss and everything you fight for and

996
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,480
all day and every day you fight for and

997
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,000
let me tell you what that Soul's goal

998
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,880
does and here's the part I want to tell

999
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,640
everybody right now this is what this

1000
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,760
Soul goal does

1001
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,960
to begin with the illness and the

1002
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
struggles we get and the chronic illness

1003
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,119
and the symptoms and the diseases that

1004
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,760
we're challenged with are to try to stop

1005
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,720
us from becoming something it's trying

1006
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,839
to stop us from doing the good in the

1007
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,800
world it hits special people if you have

1008
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,720
an illness if you have a symptom and you

1009
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,880
have a condition it's because you're

1010
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,599
special in a certain way already there's

1011
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,040
something inside of you that's probably

1012
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,640
supposed to change the world and will

1013
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,599
and what happens is and what I say by

1014
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,440
probably because you can change the

1015
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,800
world in different

1016
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,240
ways and so because someone is going to

1017
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,640
say I couldn't change the world there's

1018
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,119
no way I doubt that no no no no no

1019
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
because you you would change the world

1020
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,119
in a different way there's so many areas

1021
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,839
of the world you can change and there's

1022
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,640
all these people everybody that has the

1023
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,319
symptoms and conditions are supposed to

1024
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,160
be they're supposed to without those

1025
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:58,680
symptoms and conditions they're supposed

1026
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,960
to be World Changers so something gets

1027
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,920
in the way of that something comes the

1028
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,280
chronic illness the disease the symptoms

1029
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
come and they challenge that and they

1030
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,040
try to stop that from happening but what

1031
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,280
happens is it backfires and it always

1032
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,880
does it backfires and it always does I'm

1033
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,319
telling you I know this it backfire

1034
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,160
backfires and what happens instead is

1035
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:18,680
not only do you fight through your

1036
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,240
illness and struggles and build that

1037
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,800
Soul's gold not only do you do all that

1038
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,440
but you change the world with it and

1039
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,400
after it it comes I've watched it I've

1040
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,400
seen it all these decades people

1041
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,319
changing the world because they got sick

1042
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,200
even on the smallest ways but you need

1043
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,000
to know the smallest ways are some of

1044
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,079
the biggest ways there is some of the

1045
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,480
greatest ways there is that changes the

1046
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:45,040
world and I'm watching it out there and

1047
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,920
I see it out there and I'm telling you

1048
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,480
right now it's real and it's

1049
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,240
happening so our Soul's gold does

1050
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,560
something for us those wounds do

1051
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,839
something for us that pressure does

1052
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,319
something for us everything about it

1053
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,400
does something for us like never before

1054
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,040
it pushes us to the limit of not only

1055
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
supposedly to change the world that we

1056
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,920
were supposed to do something but it

1057
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,800
even pushes us further so we actually do

1058
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,280
so something does happen so something

1059
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,480
does alter in the world so we do things

1060
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,319
around the world around us it could even

1061
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,839
be I don't mean in the world in a ho and

1062
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,480
maybe that too of course for many but

1063
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:25,800
it's all in the above it's all of it and

1064
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,720
Gloria saw her cousin do that not only

1065
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,520
become the soul she did which was

1066
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,079
unimaginable to her which superseded

1067
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,920
which climbed above all other aspects of

1068
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,359
what she felt was spiritual growth even

1069
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,920
in her

1070
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:41,880
most unbelievable experience that

1071
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,559
occurred in her car crash and I said

1072
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,720
yeah but that car Crasher was a big deal

1073
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:50,520
she said it was nothing compared to

1074
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,400
this nothing compared to what I've

1075
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,440
watched my beloved cousin go through do

1076
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,400
and

1077
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,760
become when I speak speak to her and she

1078
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,680
speaks Anthony when I speak to her and

1079
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:09,359
she speaks there's a sound in her voice

1080
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:12,839
that I hear a power that I

1081
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,200
hear a power like no other that I hear

1082
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:19,599
that comes deep within the

1083
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,160
soul and it's it's

1084
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,240
big and it's

1085
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,680
profound and I said yeah that's the

1086
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,280
treasure that's the treasure you're

1087
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,359
hearing coming through that's the Soul's

1088

every every Medallion it rides over

1091
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,359
every medal that hangs on anybody's neck

1092
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,720

1094
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,559
rides over it it rides over it there's

1095
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,440
there's you know I've run across a lot

1096
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:58,119
of young people I told you that close to

1097
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,079
17 roughly give or takes 17 out of a 100

1098
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,920
college students come home not cuz they

1099
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,079
want to they come home not because they

1100
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,960
hate school they come home not because

1101
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,680
they they've lost interest they come

1102
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,800
home because they're sick with fatigue

1103
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,000
they're debilitatingly in pain they get

1104
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,760
all these random diagnosis no one knows

1105
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,520
anything they come home they bedridden

1106
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,640
and they have to start from scratch and

1107
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,079
they don't finish their college

1108
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,920
degree they don't go back to the

1109
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,319
university 17 out of 100

1110
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:33,359
100 every year and

1111
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,240
every across the board he just times

1112
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:39,280
that by the Thousand so it's 100 what

1113
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,839
170 out of a thousand then times that by

1114
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,319
10,000 times that by 100,000 and what

1115
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,480
happens is what I've heard from so many

1116
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,440
of them that I've had to help and

1117
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,960
recover and get their lives back so they

1118
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,559
can go back to school someday so they

1119
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,760
can go and live their lives what they

1120
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,160
would say is my friend just got my

1121
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,760
friends just graduated they just

1122
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,280
graduated

1123
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,160
but well some of my friends graduated

1124
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,480
with honor some of my friends graduated

1125
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,319
they graduated and they got their

1126
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,079
degrees and they they got all of that

1127
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,839
and they were able to attend graduation

1128
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,720
and they said and and and they felt

1129
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,839
terrible they felt like they were a loss

1130
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,839
of life they felt like they were losers

1131
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,400
they felt like whatever and I said I and

1132
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,160
I said no no no no no no what you have

1133
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,599
that's building right here is more

1134
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,119
valuable than a degree a degree to hang

1135
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,240
on wall it's more valuable than and look

1136
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:30,920
I'm not trying to undermine those

1137
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,200
degrees and achievements they're they're

1138
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,480
wonderful and they're and we need those

1139
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
in life and all those things this not

1140
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,680
what I'm doing I'm just saying for the

1141
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,319
ones that need to hear this because it's

1142
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,079
the truth is that what they're what

1143
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:46,520
they're achieving climbing out of their

1144
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,559
illness there's much greater me you

1145
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,599
can't you can't hang that on the wall on

1146
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,760
a

1147
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,319
plaque in fact it wouldn't do it justice

1148
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,839
it wouldn't you couldn't hang it on a

1149
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,599
wall you couldn't put solid gold the

1150
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:03,520
diamonds in a plaque and you just it

1151
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,119
wouldn't even touch what's what's

1152
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,319
inside the the St the the students that

1153
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,119
have seen that have had to become

1154
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,720
students of their soul students of their

1155
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,359
heart and soul and of their chronic

1156
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,160
illness and Experts of their chronic

1157
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:16,520
illness to rise above it rise out of the

1158
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,200
ashes and heal and move forward and get

1159
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,000
better and get better and then yeah sure

1160
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,559
go back to school again go back to

1161
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,920
school again and you know what many of

1162
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,480
them that have helped have gone back to

1163
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,760
school recovered and gone back to school

1164
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,280
and they've gotten their degree and they

1165
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,960
said that degree didn't really have a

1166
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,640
lot of meaning compared to what they've

1167
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,400
gone through sure they they they

1168
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,359
respected it they honored it it it

1169
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,720
whatever and it it did what it did and

1170
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,920
it had its purpose it had its purpose

1171
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,200
absolutely but they they would tell me

1172
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,880
more than one say but what I've learned

1173
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,599
my whole life's changed and where I'm

1174
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,640
going at this my whole life's changed my

1175
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,319
soul's changed I'm changed as a person

1176
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,319
on every

1177
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,480
level and you know and I and I told told

1178
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,480
those stories to to my friend Gloria and

1179
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,359
she said

1180
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,480
well it's definitely similar it's

1181
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:05,960
similar my cousin's gone through because

1182
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,480
you couldn't hang it on the wall you

1183
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,599
couldn't put it in a plaque you couldn't

1184
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,400
embroid embroider it with diamonds and

1185
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,760
and emeralds it just wouldn't do it

1186
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,480
justice and when illness and and

1187
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,200
struggles and hardships try to hold us

1188
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,839
back when they try to hold us back to

1189
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,040
stop us from changing the world it

1190
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:25,000
backfires and it totally blows up and it

1191
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,920
explodes and it goes backfires and we

1192
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,359
end up changing the world more than we

1193
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,599
would have ever done

1194
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,200
anyway we end up rising out of the ashes

1195
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,960
and healing we end up getting better and

1196
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,880
stronger but what happens is we have

1197
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,000
something no one else has we have the

1198
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,480
Soul's gold like no one else has and we

1199
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,920
have this power nobody else has and as

1200
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:52,119
we heal all through it and move forward

1201
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,800
anybody we talk to the words that come

1202
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,800
out of your mouth are different than

1203
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,559
they would have ever been anytime else

1204
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,240
else and they're profound and they

1205
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,880
change the lives of others whether they

1206
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,520
can tell in that moment or they can tell

1207
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,240
later on and they if they don't tell in

1208
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,319
that moment that's fine they and it ends

1209
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:11,280
up changing their lives later

1210
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:15,520
on something happens that no one can

1211
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,760
touch no one no one's got their finger

1212
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,280
on that no one's got on you no one's got

1213
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,559
on you something happens when you go

1214
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,040
through what you've gone through and

1215
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,880
your Soul's gold builds and strengthens

1216
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,720
and becomes like no other your spirit

1217
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,559
your heart and your soul like no other

1218
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,960
before and it's you can't touch that no

1219
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:43,119
one can touch that out there you need to

1220
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,960
know that no Fancy free person who

1221
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,000
hasn't had any real symptoms or

1222
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,400
conditions you know some sniffles or

1223
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,480
something or whatever they go to the

1224
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,040
doctor they take an antibiotic or

1225
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,400
whatever it is no one can touch what

1226
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,599
you've gone

1227
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,760
through and no

1228
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:02,480
one no one has the soul that you have

1229
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,400

1230
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,960

1231
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,640

themselves they think back of all their

1287
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,640
mistakes and they think back of

1288
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,760
everything they did wrong and they

1289
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,599
blamed themselves and they convinced

1290
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,480
themselves they created their illness

1291
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,920

did and they look back at their

1293
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,079
shortcomings and their weaknesses and

1294
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,599
they look back at the things they've

1295
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,040
said to people and they look back

1296
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,640
whatever you do do not go back there and

1297
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,880
look at all

1298
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,240
that because you're a good person you're

1299
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,000
a good person and you're Rising above it

1300
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,400
all and then some because what people

1301
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
don't do when they're not challenged

1302
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,920
like this is they don't care even to

1303
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,839
look back at all that stuff they don't

1304
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,400
even really want to look back at all

1305
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:37,839
that stuff they just keep on going ahead

1306
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,480
whatever bad habit they've ever had

1307
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,680
whatever systematic Behavior they've had

and you start judging yourself and you

1317
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,559
start putting yourself on the hot seat

1318
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,160

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,040
else and nobody else everybody's Soul

1335
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,960
Souls gold is a little different it's a

1336
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,280
little different in different

1337
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,160
ways that's a little different and a

1338
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,880
little bit more powerful in other ways

1339
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,319
and another person's Soul's gold is a

1340
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,359
little bit more powerful in other way

1341
00:52:55,319 --> 00:53:01,960
ways and well that's what's happening

1342
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:03,880
there but your Soul's gold is unique to

1343
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,280
what you've been through and what you've

1344
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,160
gone through in life and you struggled

1345
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,280
through and the value of that can't be

1346
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,480
matched by any golden fortnox it can't

1347
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:20,160
be matched by any treasure there is it

1348
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,119
can never be matched by anything so you

1349
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,160
need to know what you Harbor and you

1350
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,880
have and don't let the demons do the

1351
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,319
talking

1352
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,280
so many with chronic

1353
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,599

1355
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,640
