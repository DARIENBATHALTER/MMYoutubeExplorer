6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
radio show where each week I talk about

the most advanced healing information

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,240
is not found anywhere else and is

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,120
Decades of ahead head of what's out

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,680
there now and I've recently been seeing

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
that it's been upsetting a few

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,440
professionals out there the fact that

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,200
the information's advanced and the

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,640
information is ahead of the time and it

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,480
makes certain people feel uncomfortable

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,559
it's the last thing I want to happen or

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,760
um to get anybody stirred up that's not

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,239
it although stirring the pot gets people

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,160
to think and it gets people to move

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,559
forward in different ways but still at

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
the same time you know when

23
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,760
practitioners and healers and doctors

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
doctors especially doctors and they go

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,519
whether it's alternative or conventional

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,159
they go to medical school they go in

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,200
because they want to save the world they

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,280
want to save people they want to

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,400
discover something they want to know

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,240

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,840
an illness and that means it's so much

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,560
it's incredible what you know and they

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,640
go in with compassion and they go in

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,280
because they in their heart and soul

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,479

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,520
to have those answers and that's what's

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,439
amazing about the health field and the

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,399
most incredible part of it of the

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,320
journey in and and in people's souls and

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,280
in their hearts and so you know I mean

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,159
over the years I've run across some some

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,600
amazing Professionals in the health

44
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,719
realm that that want to hear the

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,920
information I have to offer they want to

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,840
hear it because they they know they've

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,920
been around the block long enough they

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
they've been there long enough whether

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,240
they struggled with their own illness

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,599
and couldn't find an answer or theyve

51
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,239
they just want answers no matter what or

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,599
where or how the source is they want to

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,120
know what's going on for their patients

54
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,319
and then have come across you know some

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,840
some different professionals that hey if

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,319
it's not in a textbook somewhere they

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,400
don't want to hear it they don't want to

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,319
know and that's too bad it's really sad

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,239
because you got to keep an open mind you

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,120
got to keep you know belief systems you

61
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,120
know on what I call like neutral the

62
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,000
best you can because the information

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
that comes from Spirit that that I've

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,920
been given the gift to offer is

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,480
information to consider and truly

66
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,319
consider you know and and I'm not saying

67
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,840
hey it's the end all or anything someone

68
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,959
said to me well you got all the answers

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
you got all the answers Mr bigshot and

70
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,879
that's not it at all I don't have any

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,720
answers it's Spirit giving me the

72
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,360
information I'm the messenger I'm the

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,760
voice also for people who have struggled

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,360
and suffered offered for years and

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,239
decades with no answers in no direction

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,799
and that's frightening right there not

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,360
having the right answers or having a

78
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,879
diagnosis that's you know not even the

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,959
right diagnosis or a label that isn't

80
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,879
even correct or an understanding I mean

81
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,519
you guys know if you listen to the show

82
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,280
you've heard enough shows to know

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,360
there's so much going on underneath

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,799
these labels and these mystery illnesses

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,720
and chronic and mystery illness is so

86
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,239
out of control it's getting out of

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,239
control more and more rapidly and

88
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,000
rampantly so for a professional to or

89
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,879
professionals to you know put a blind

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,480
eye to information or think it's not a

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,040
credible source is really a disservice

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,560
to patients and other people like I said

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,560
I know so many doctors and professionals

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,360
that want information and they don't

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,239
care they want to hear it they want to

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
understand it they want to know and they

97
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,519
want to they want to level that against

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,360
the information they've learned and they

99
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:06,000
want to equate it or equalize it or

100
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,360
neutralize it so they can find answers

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,319
because when it comes to Healing The

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Miraculous healing process of the human

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,879
body no one really has their finger on

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,440
that part because the because it it has

105
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,120
a lot to do with God it has a lot to do

106
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,280
with human nature it has a lot to do

107
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,080
with so many different facets and so

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,560
basically what I'm trying to say is yes

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,240
the information is ahead of the time on

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,400

always said the show is and everything I

122
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,919
do is for the person who's not even a

123
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,800
practitioner it's a for the person to

124
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,880
become their own expert it's for the

125
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,280
person to become an expert and know more

126
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,199
also than no more than many people or

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,000
many practitioners out there so it's

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,080
about making sure everybody's armed and

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,479
everybody's armed with the power of

130
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,000
information The Shield of information

131
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,800
the armor of information from a source

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that was given to me since age four and

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,000
um and someone said how is it possible

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,319
you have so much information you put it

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,400
out on blogs you write articles

136
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,319
constantly you have it in your books

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,440
it's never ending and it's and it's all

138
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,680
it's like brand new coming off the shelf

139
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,880

140
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
way that's possible and and someone also

141
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,199
said well it how do you store all that

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,840
in your head I don't it comes streaming

143
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,240
through from Spirit and that's the gift

144
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,400
and that's why the books are coming out

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
and they're going to keep on coming out

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400

honored to be here during the show

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,840
today's show is about food poisoning

168
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,880
food poisoning have you ever had food

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,840
poisoning have you had that before I

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,520
have I've had it before when I was a

171
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,479
child one time I talked about a little

172
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,400
bit I talked about a couple of lines

173
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,520
about it in my my first book medical

174
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,280
medium but food poisoning is rampant yes

175
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,560
it's out there it's everywhere and we

176
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,599
have to be careful there's a lot you can

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,759
understand to avoid it why would you

178
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,599
want to avoid food poisoning because it

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,800
has killed a lot of people it has ended

180
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,599
a lot of lives for a lot of people and

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,800
also injured and wounded a lot of people

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,720
as well along the way where they've been

183
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,199

poisoning um you know there's a lot of

222

224
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,240

227
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,480
along the way that have been injured

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,120
from food poisoning are really hit hard

229
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:22,760
from it so what what can we do to

230
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,399
prevent it we're going to hit all

231
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,120
aspects first of all it's important to

232
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:32,079
understand that I'm not going to make

233
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,279
fun of any diet belief system in this

234
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,640
episode but I am going to talk a little

235
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,800
bit more about meat eating and chicken

236
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,320
eating and turkey eating and pork eating

237
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,839
not in the negative way like hey you

238
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,560
should well you shouldn't eat pork that

239
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,880
that part I'll definitely say just no

240
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,640
one should be eating pork I don't care

241
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,800
who it is just saying there's no healthy

242
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
bacon now I realized that one of the

243
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,480
listeners out there two or three or 10

244
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,800
of them for all I know could be raising

245
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,560
their own their own pigs and and and

246
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,560
raising them in the best way and that's

247
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,320
amazing so if you are going to have if

248
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,000
you are going to have bacon and it's

249
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,600
your own Pig you're raising and that's

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,040
the and that's what you do I I support

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,399
it okay I do it just don't eat a lot of

252
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,079
it don't eat a lot of it don't have it

253
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,399
every day keep it in the freezer or

254
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,120
something you know uh longer term

255
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,079
stretch it out more just so you don't

256
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,760
you know burden down the liver and the

257
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,760
pancreas and everything else because no

258
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,720
matter what pork is still high fat even

259
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,800
though the white meat of pork so okay so

260
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,279
back on to this I'm not going to be

261
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,720
ripping in to you know a belief system

262
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,000
if you like animal products I support

263
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,480
you and I'm going to support you on how

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,959
to protect yourself how to protect

265
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,760
yourself that's what I'm going to do and

266
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,320
if you're a vegetarian or a vegan or

267
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,959
whatever just eat fish I'm going to

268
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,200
support you to protect yourself because

269
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,839
you have to be protected there too when

270
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,680
it comes down to food poisoning believe

271
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
it or not because we go into restaurants

272
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,079
if you're a vegan or a vegetarian you go

273
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,279
into a restaurant you can go into a

274
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
restaurant and and uh what happens is in

275
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
that

276
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,920
restaurant um you could be having a

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,040
salad or something or or or so forth and

278
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,000
that salad could have been contaminated

279
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,959
it could have been you know that salad

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,480
could have been um um cont

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
cross-contaminated with something else

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,839
in there in in in the restaurant in the

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
kitchen the restaurant I'm going to go

284
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,600
deep into that in a little bit so so

285
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,959
let's let's rip into this let's do this

286
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,760
so on meats and chickens and Fishes

287
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,480
that's where we have to worry pretty

288
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,399
much the most is how we're preparing

289
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,040
meat and chicken you know this if you

290
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,959
eat chicken that's raw what can happen

291
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,760
you can die yeah you can die not just

292
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,200
get sick but but die lose a life you

293
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,959
know there's so many people who

294
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,399
undercook a turkey for Thanksgiving the

295
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,120
hospitals are filled with sick people

296
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,160
that have had underdone turkey in during

297
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
Thanksgiving there are hundreds and

298
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,480
hundreds actually thousands of food

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,839
poisoning turkey dinner cases in the

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,199
hospitals and ERS across the country

301
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,079
during Thanksgiving so so what we have

302
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,639
to understand is why is that how is that

303
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,440
happening what's going on with that what

304
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,760
what makes that happen well so so so we

305
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,880
need to be safe bottom line bottom line

306
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,199
so you know I talk to doctors a lot and

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,079
and over the years and have a lot of

308
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:41,000
doctor friends and and they've seen

309
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,000
people die from food poisoning like it's

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,880
no joke when you talk to a a doctor

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,639
who's been who seen it or is aware of it

312
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,320
he or she will have a look on their face

313
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:59,079
and say it's it's it's almost like the

314
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:02,639
most most sad death because it could a

315
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:05,160
could have been avoided maybe B there's

316
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,800
so many other things we can die from

317
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,839
that food poisoning really it shouldn't

318
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,440
be on the list because this is food

319
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,279
safety this is food this is food we're

320
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,079
eating this is our lives this is what

321
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,600
we're

322
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,680
doing so okay so what do we do when

323
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,519
we're making food at home and we're

324
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,880
going to hit restaurants too this is

325
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,560
important so what what are we doing when

326
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,800
we're making food at home well first of

327
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,040
all you have to make sure that your

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
hands and you will probably already know

329
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,880
this many of you if you're taking

330
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,800
chicken out of a package touching the

331
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,079
package itself is already a problem

332
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,800
right there that means when you touch

333
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,560
that package your hands already have

334
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,000
bacteria on it and I'm not just talking

335
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,880
about salola in the packag is in the

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,240
grocery store chicken and meat of all

337
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,519
kinds there's SEI and some sorry there's

338
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,920
SEI and Mera all over the outside of

339
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,360
pack packages at the grocery store

340
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,040
that's number one right there so there's

341
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,800
bacteria loaded on the outside of every

342
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,600
one of those wrapped packages so when

343
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,600
you're just grabbing the package and

344
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
you're like oh honey hey and you take it

345
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,920
out of the refrigerator we're going to

346
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,040
have chicken tonight and you put it down

347
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,720
you put it down on the counter now your

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,600
hand is a weapon that can actually

349
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,440
injure your children right there right

350
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,480
there so you have to go and wash your

351
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,759
hands right there right after you touch

352
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,320
that package or after you opened it up

353
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,360
you got to make sure you always have a

354
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,360
clean hand when you touch your knife the

355
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,240
handle of your knife or your handle will

356
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,839
have bacteria from when it was dirty so

357
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,320
if you take a package out of the

358
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
refrigerator honey would you like

359
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,399
chicken tonight then what do the kids

360
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,120
want and you put that chicken on the

361
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,240
counter okay and now you grab the knife

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
to open up the package to cut the

363
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,440

is this being more is this being phobic

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,079
is this is that what it is no it's not

371
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,120
trust me it's not it's being big time

372
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,560
safe Big Time safe I've seen a lot of

373
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,440
food poisoning cases in my day in the 30

374
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,240
plus years and more and even before that

375
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,399
and so so that's one thing to always be

376
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,639
con concerned about so what do you do

377
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,279
you can do a couple things you can

378
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,800
purchase those night trial gloves those

379
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,800
blue n trial gloves you know the ones

380
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,440
you see um at different places and stuff

381
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,480
you know the ones where they pat you

382
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,880
down at the uh or you see you see not

383
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,639
they pat you down at the airport if you

384
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,800
don't want to go through the scanner or

385
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,319
they have the night trial gloves at the

386
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,720
airport everybody's wearing them when

387
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,319
they're looking at your ID when you're

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,759
walking through whatever it is those

389
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,440
night Tri gloves and you see them at the

390
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,319
dentist's office you see them everywhere

391
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,160
now so so you can wear those until your

392
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,839
chicken is out into wherever you're

393
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,800
going to be start preparing it or making

394
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,040
it and then tear tear the gloves off and

395
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,440
you got instant Clean Hands you that's

396
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,720
one way of doing it you can you know

397
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,560
change your knife if you know your knife

398
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,880
was contaminated in different ways the

399
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,639
handle of the knife was contaminated but

400
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,680
this is just the tip of the iceberg okay

401
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,199
rinsing off your chicken in the in the

402
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,399
sink is a common thing we do the problem

403
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,199
is with that is you just rinsed all this

404
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,160
dangerous bacteria in the sink and it's

405
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,440
just sitting there right off the chicken

406
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,079
and and what happens is then you go

407
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,759
watch washing an orange or washing a

408
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,600
some lettuce in the sink and the lettuce

409
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,160
Falls in or touches the side of the sink

410
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
and you

411
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,959
forget and that lettuce touching the

412
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,279
side of the sink could have picked up

413
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,079
some of that bacteria from rinsing the

414
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,920
chicken off first so there's so many

415
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,360
things to be concerned about and to be

416
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,319
worried about and we have to be careful

417
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,679
and here's the other thing if you put

418
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,439
chicken in a plate that's raw and you

419
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,600
didn't cook it yet and it's in a plate

420
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,600
that's raw that plate that Plate's done

421
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,640
after you start frying that chicken or

422
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,480
start boiling that chicken or start

423
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,240
doing what you want to do if that

424
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,640
chicken was raw in a plate that Plate's

425
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,839
done that means that plate goes

426
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,039
somewhere it goes in the dishwasher it

427
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,919
goes in the sink wherever it goes but it

428
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,480
goes

429
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,840
somewhere because you can't put that

430
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,400
cooked chicken once that chicken's

431
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,039
cooked I've seen people put that cooked

432
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,080
chicken right on top of that same plate

433
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,720
where the raw chicken sat same thing

434
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,640
with Meats I've seen people have the raw

435
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
steak the steak on a plate they go to

436
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,799
the barbecue in the back or the grill in

437
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,080
the back okay they you know lift that

438
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,240
steak off that plate there's raw juices

439
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,840
on that plate throw that steak on the

440
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,960
burner on the grill whatever it is in

441
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,440
the backyard they're cooking that steak

442
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,840
and then when when that steak's done

443
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,919
they throw it right back on the plate

444
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,039
with the

445
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,240
juices bam instant food poisoning

446
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,440
possibilities and it's a it's a luck of

447
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,360
the draw it's Russian Roulette Russian

448
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,640
roulette with your lives so hey that's

449
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,280
that that once that steak was on that

450
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,080
plate that that's done that's over with

451
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,520
right there once that's you know once

452
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,520
that's been on there that's over with so

453
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,640
you move that over over so so and you

454
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
get a new plate and you put that cook

455
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,320
steak on that new plate but that's not

456
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,880
where it all stops barbecuing with the

457
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,159
sauces you got the brush sticking in the

458
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,200
sauces and then you're you're you're

459
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,960
glazing the raw meat with that

460
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,280
sauce so you got the sauce brush and

461
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,000
you're glazing your ribs you're glazing

462
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,640
your steak you're glazing whatever it is

463
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,600
your pork chops whatever it is you got

464
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,919
cooking you're glazing with some kind of

465
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,440
sauce well as that brush is rubbing on

466
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,000
that raw meat raw pork raw chicken

467
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,919
whatever it may be it's just pulling

468
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,679
bacteria off right into that sauce and

469
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,720
you put it right back in your big your

470
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,880
big dish of fresh sauce over there and

471
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,760
the problem is with that is a lot of

472
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,799
people stick their finger in the sauce

473
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:27,120
they they taste it after that boom food

474
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,679
poisoning also another thing happens

475
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,600
what they do is right after after it's

476
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,039
been cooked right after the pork's been

477
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,120
cooked the meat's been cooked the

478
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,240
chicken's been cooked they stick more

479
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,000
sauce on it at the end which isn't

480
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,679
getting cooked now because it's going on

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,080
top it's glazing on top after it already

482
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:49,720
did on the raw meat chicken or pork

483
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,720
beforehand see you know you see how it

484
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:57,360
works so food poisoning is really easy

485
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,640
to get and what can food poisoning do

486
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,640
well it's a lot of different strains of

487
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,600
ecoli rip right through your guts break

488
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,400
into your gallbladder explode it people

489
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,960
lose their gallbladders all the time run

490
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
down to the appendix get you an appendix

491
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,480
operation a lot of confusion happens at

492
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,640
the doctor's off or at the ER they don't

493
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,120
know what's wrong um they don't know if

494
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,360
it's food poisoning or not while you're

495
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,400
in agony and vomiting and diarrhea they

496
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,640
don't know they just wait you just wait

497
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
it out and the problem is that the ER is

498
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,280
not a lot they can do but just stick an

499
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,320
IV in you to keep you from dying from

500
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,960
dehydration and hopes that your vomiting

501
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,240
eases off and the diarrhea eases off and

502
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,679
because I know for a fact by by knowing

503
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
so many professionals and so many

504
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,799
doctors and being friends with many good

505
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,159
doctors over the years I know for a fact

506
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,679
that and ER doctors emergency room

507
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,799
doctors hospital doctors I know for a

508
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,480
fact that when people have food

509
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,080
poisoning it's a matter of time and

510
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,280
chance and luck and doctors know that

511
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,600
when you're sitting your butt in a

512
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
hospital in a hospital hospital bed and

513
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,159
you've just vomited for two straight

514
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,000
days and had diarrhea for two straight

515
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,720
days including maybe some blood involved

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,760
or maybe none of that just

517
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,000
pain and you're in the hospital for two

518
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,480
days on an IV they all wait it out and

519
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,039
they all look at each other like is this

520
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,919
person going to make it or

521
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,919
not that's how serious food poisoning is

522
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,080
so at the same time you know you can

523
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,440
heal and you can get past that as well

524
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,760
at the same time there's things you

525
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,799
could do that we're going to talk about

526
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,279
that up your game so you don't end up in

527
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,679
trouble so you don't end up in that

528
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,320
waiting game so if you do get food

529
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,360
poisoning no big deal you vomit for a

530
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,480
bit have diarrhea for a bit but it's not

531
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
going to take you out because we're

532
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,279
going to prepare you with some options

533
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,960
to make sure that you're not in that

534
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,279
situation where you're in a hospital and

535
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,240
doctors looking at each other after

536
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,400
you've been sitting there for 5 days on

537
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,600
IV with no ability of putting food down

538
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,120
or water down the pike and so we're

539
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
going to make sure that we we prepare

540
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,320
you the best you can best we can in any

541
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,159
way possible so that it's you get food

542
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,000
poisoning it doesn't take you out and

543
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,960
maybe maybe you throw up a couple times

544
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
and that's it maybe you know whatever it

545
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,520
is but we're going to we're going to

546
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,679
help you in every way so to to look out

547
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,080
for your family your friends it's not

548
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,480
about fear it's not about scaring you

549
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,080
it's about protecting you it matters

550
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,120
I've protected a lot of people over the

551
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,000
years and it mattered and it Protected

552
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,760
Their Lives when they got food poisoning

553
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,440
they weren't scared because they knew

554
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,880
options they knew how to handle it they

555
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,679
knew how to deal with it they knew what

556
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,600
to do and so all the

557
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:35,840
matters um so okay let's go let's go

558
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,159
back into contamination a little bit so

559
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,919
I have to worry about that

560
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,880
cross-contamination putting that steak

561
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,400
back on that plate that there's juices

562
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,799
in that plate you know using that big

563
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,960
fork that went and put the steak on off

564
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,960
the plate onto the grill and then when

565
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,159
the steak was done taking that fork

566
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,919
jamming it into that steak and and and

567
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,240
and running new bacteria in it and

568
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,039
putting it back on that plate all these

569
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,880
things we have to consider every last

570
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,440
bit of it now I know this makes it hard

571
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,880
and not enjoyable as much so when you're

572
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,440
cooking hamburgers on a grill you might

573
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,400
be like well you know Anthony scared the

574
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,880
bedin out of me so much it's not I'm

575
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,520
taking the enjoyment out of my fourth of

576
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,120
July cookout that's you that's not what

577
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,799
I'm trying to do but it it could it

578
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,919
could spook you a little bit but once

579
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,520
again it's important to understand how

580
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,720
all of this works

581
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,480
so contamination chicken in the kitchen

582
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,600
yeah we want to make sure that you clean

583
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,480
your surfaces The Cutting Board Factor

584
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,039
happens all the time people put raw

585
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,720
chicken right on The Cutting Board and

586
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,760
they're they're slicing it or cutting it

587
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
there or filling it or whatever I mean

588
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,320
opening it up and doing some kind of

589
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
stuffed stuffed um breast and they're

590
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,400
they're preparing it on the cutting

591
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,480
board and all that raw chickens Over The

592
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,640
Cutting Board you got to make sure that

593
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,919
you wash that cutting board off good you

594
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
can't can't just throw it in the in the

595
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,440
sink and give it a quick rinse I would

596
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,039
have another cutting board nearby so if

597
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,960
you you're pretty much done with that

598
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,679
cutting board I just move it you know

599
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,880
move it over make sure it's nowhere to

600
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,480
be found make sure it's in the in the

601
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,760
you know on a different counter or

602
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,840
something like that put a new cutting

603
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,360
board down so that if you know whatever

604
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,080
you're doing whether it's plates or

605
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
whatever I mean remember if chicken

606
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,320
juices are on the counter or on a

607
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,960
cutting board and you put a clean plate

608
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,080
on top of that cutting board or that

609
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,760
counter the bottom of the plate has

610
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,760
possibility of of some dangerous

611
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,320
bacteria at the bottom of the plate so

612
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
even when you put that cooked food that

613
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,240
cooked chicken right off the right off

614
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,360
the pan right on top of that new plate

615
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,640
and then you stick your hand underneath

616
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:49,240
that plate to serve someone you got now

617
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:53,240
that raw chicken on your hand it's so

618
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,760
easy in so many ways to get this stuff

619
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,840
around so okay if you're not perfect at

620
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,960
any of this fine fine but at least

621
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,399
you're more aware of it maybe and that's

622
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,320
the key too you got to be more aware of

623
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,240
it make sure oh wait did I just use that

624
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,120
fork in this raw chicken and I forgot

625
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,200
and I put it to the side and now I'm

626
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,720
giving one of my guests that fork at the

627
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,360
table you know it's everything

628
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,360
everything matters why does it matter

629
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,399
because the animal products can kill us

630
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,919
they can kill us now I know there's a

631
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,159
lot of um there's a lot of vegan doctors

632
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,360
out there and stuff that say yeah well

633
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,960
it can kill us cuz it can clag your

634
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,520
arteries and it could it can uh you know

635
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,880
it could do this it can do that it can

636
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,159
give you heart attacks it can make your

637
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,039
cholesterol go up and sure sure sure

638
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,760
sure I'm talking about it can kill you

639
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:45,399
it can kill you you eat raw chicken you

640
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,559
can die you eat raw turkey you can die

641
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,919
and you know you eat raw steak you can

642
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,919
die never do raw steak tartar never do

643
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,240
anything tartar never do anything raw

644
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,320
don't even do raw fish whatever you do

645
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,760
make sure it's cooked you like fish you

646
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,080
cook it you cook it you know I worked on

647
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,000
a boat a long long time ago for fun and

648
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,000
uh to get some fresh air and go out a go

649
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,480
on go out on a fishing boat and I I you

650
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,120
know did that to help out a friend and

651
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,760
and so forth and everything and when I

652
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,480
was out there I saw a

653
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,480
worm that that came out of a fish that

654
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,200
came out of a fish the worm stretched

655
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,679
six feet long six feet long

656
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,679
this worm and that worm used to be a

657
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,440
tiny egg inside the fish you don't want

658
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,200
and this is a wild fish you don't want

659
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,039
and and you and and I pul I I grabbed

660
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,640
that worm and I stretched it out it was

661
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,480
six feet long and it was alive and it

662
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,600
was

663
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,159
squiring and it was a worm that was

664
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,399
inside a fish you know when the fish was

665
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:57,799
cut open the worm popped out and so you

666
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,840
don't want to eat raw fish if you're big

667
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,640
into Sushi I just I'm just I just would

668
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,720
say no I would say first of all you're

669
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,000
not supposed to be doing tuna anyway

670
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,760
tuna is really not a good thing maybe

671
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,720
you could do salmon sushi but still you

672
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,640
always have the possibility of getting a

673
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,480
couple of eggs in you from you know from

674
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,960
some

675
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,960
worms but you want your salmon cooked

676
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,880
you want your fish cooked and you want

677
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,720
to apply similar laws where you don't

678
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,600
want

679
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,720
cross-contamination where you want to be

680
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,679
careful with that

681
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,360
cross-contamination you want to you fish

682
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,720
juices that are on the counter on the

683
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:38,600
plate whatever it may be it's important

684
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,240
now look grass-fed beef Freer range

685
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,880
chicken has less bacterial

686
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,960
possibilities than Factory farmed meat

687
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,440
and chicken and turkey and so forth and

688
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,960
we know that you guys know that I'm sure

689
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
you do that's what's

690
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,399
amazing about you know grass-fed beef

691
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,240
and everything else that it is

692
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,760
especially from small sources small

693
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,559
farms but even small farms have to ship

694
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,320
they have to ship their

695
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:10,760
cattle to a small Factory and the small

696
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,880
Factory could have different things

697
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,880
running through it and so forth I don't

698
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,440
think in a lot of States it's legal for

699
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,559
a very small farm you know doing their

700
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,080
grass-fed beef and growing their growing

701
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:27,039
their cows and and slaughtering on

702
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,880
slaughtering them on site um I don't

703
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,399
think that's allowed in a lot of places

704
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,600
they have to ship them I mean they have

705
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,720
to send them to the old factory so even

706
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,240
though they raised them in it's high

707
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,799
quality grass-fed beef they have to ship

708
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,880
them to a factory and that factory could

709
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,799
be more wholesome more free range more

710
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,240
grass-fed in the sense of its nature of

711
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,240
the factory and everything around it but

712
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I've seen situations where the factories

713
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,559
weren't really like that and they're

714
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,760
running through a lot of different

715
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,799
business and okay sure here's the

716
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,960
grass-fed beef stuff coming in but what

717
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,320
was before that was grain fed and so

718
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,399
there's possibilities for

719
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,600
cross-contamination even in the best

720
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,519
circumstances of grass-fed and free

721
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,519
range now once again once again just so

722
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,000
no one's angered no one's upset doesn't

723
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,919
mean I don't support anybody who's who

724
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,360
thinks that meat's good or doesn't or a

725
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,519
belief system or they love grass-fed

726
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,440
beef whatever it doesn't mean I don't

727
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,600
support all that that's not about it

728
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,880
that's about making sure that you're

729
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,640
protected that's that's what I care

730
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,159
about no matter what um and it covers

731
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,960
every part of the aspects that we talk

732
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,799
about in all that different episodes so

733
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,200
but there is less contamination with

734
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,519
grass-fed beef free range chicken

735
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,760
there's less possibilities for Dangerous

736
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,640
strains of salmonella dangerous strains

737
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,440
of eoli and so forth so all the

738
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,640
different you know bugs and varieties of

739
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,600
bugs that we worry about and and so that

740
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,399
matters but it doesn't mean it's not

741
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,960
still dangerous and the possibilities

742
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,360
aren't still dangerous so we have to

743
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,519
understand that conventional eggs the

744
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,080
outside of conventional eggs are loaded

745
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,799
with bacteria loaded salmonella on the

746
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,200
outside of conventional eggs you know

747
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:10,679
unconventional eggs free range eggs they

748
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,840
don't have that on the outside of the

749
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,320
eggs it's rare to none so that's an

750
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,399
example of of of how much better it can

751
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,760
get just you know I always say don't eat

752
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,320
the eggs if you're viral you get

753
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,960
neurological problems if you got been

754
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,399
diagnosed with any kind of autoimmune

755
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,440
whatever it is I always say don't do the

756
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,039
eggs anyway we know that

757
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,000
so all

758
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,880
right so we're getting out of the

759
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,120
kitchen tricks the whole bit and and

760
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,720
kitchen tricks meaning being cautious

761
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,440
the way you're plating things that the

762
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,399
knives you're sticking in food making

763
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,279
sure that that wasn't the knife going

764
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,640
into raw meat and then sitting there and

765
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,200
being used again you name it we're being

766
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,440
cautious on all of that so let's go into

767
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,120
restaurants let's go into restaurants

768
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,799
this is important this is really

769
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,320
important restaurants it's it's it's

770
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,320
hell in those kitchens I'm just going to

771
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,480
tell you right now what I mean by hell

772
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,880
in those kitchens the pressure is is uh

773
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,519
insurmountable in kitchens for on the

774
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,799
cooks and the chefs the pressure is

775
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,559
unbelievable the pressure and I've

776
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,840
talked about this with Epstein bars and

777
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,000
stuff a lot of chefs cut their fingers

778
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,240
daily in kitchens whether it's a slight

779
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
cut a mild cut or an old cut that's

780
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,120
still bleeding on and off from being

781
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,159
banged around with pots and pans the

782
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,559
cuts happen all the time

783
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,399
there's a lot of Band-Aids on Chefs in

784
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,320
the kitchens they do throw gloves on

785
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,080
when they get cut okay but then you know

786
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,600
that glove after a day they take the

787
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,799
glove off the Cut's still kind of there

788
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,000
it's still seeping that happens all the

789
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,639
time and with when regards to Epstein

790
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,639
bar that's an easy way to catch Epstein

791
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:49,480
bar or a new Epstein bar or someone's

792
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,919
Epstein bar so I'm going to talk about

793
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,679
what to do to protect yourself on that

794
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,799
level but food poisoning my God that one

795
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,919
right there for kitchens is really what

796
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,000
we need need to look at is the most

797
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:05,039
important of all because in kitchens

798
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,440
they wash all that lettuce in the sinks

799
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,440
they wash chicken I mean it's

800
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,600
unbelievable what happens countertops

801
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,840
surfaces are never washed good enough

802
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,000
there's all kinds of things

803
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,880
interchanging constantly you can be

804
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,880
getting a vegetarian dish that's in a

805
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,440
chicken restaurant or a meat serving

806
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,320
restaurant and you can be getting a

807
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,880
vegetarian dish because you you want

808
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,679
vegetarian and that pan

809
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,880
could literally have been splashed by

810
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,639
chicken going into the pan next to it

811
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,919
raw chicken going into the pan next to

812
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:36,760
it for somebody else's dinner here's

813
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,360
what I

814
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,880
recommend I recommend that if first of

815
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,440
all if you're a meat eater chicken eater

816
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,559
whatever in the whole bit Animal product

817
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,919
eater and you know it doesn't matter

818
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,480
what restaurant you eat in in a sense

819
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,639
okay well unless it's a fast food

820
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,880
restaurant with fried food and

821
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,600
everything else that's ridiculous you

822
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,320
know what I mean getting in a good

823
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,080
restaurant a a decent restaurant if

824
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,080
you're a vegan that vegetarian you know

825
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,480
plant-based person don't ever eat in an

826
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,039
animal product serving restaurant then

827
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,320
you can really protect yourself but okay

828
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,240
say you have no choice as a plant-based

829
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,120
person and you have to go out with

830
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,120
family and friends and they also serve

831
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,480
chicken and whatever there so and fish

832
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,880
so never eat

833
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:26,559
raw ever in a restaurant as a

834
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,600
plant-based person that's serving

835
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,679
chicken

836
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,279
or meat or anything else this is

837
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:36,600
critical to know because you're going to

838
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,720
get your raw salad but your raw salad

839
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,639
was made by somebody with bare hands

840
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,480
that just held a chicken because they're

841
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:49,639
under so much pressure there's no rules

842
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,919
it is literally like it's like Mad Max

843
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:53,600
it's like there's no rules it's like

844
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,480
Escape From New York or whatever you

845
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,639
know we're talking about it's you know

846
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,159
the old movies there's no rules in those

847
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:02,880
kitchens when when stuff's fly and

848
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,519
everything and maybe there are a couple

849
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,039
kitchens that have it down pat but

850
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
there's a couple of kitchens sure but

851
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,240
there's hundreds and hundreds of

852
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,200
kitchens where it's all about get this

853
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,159
ready get this done people want this now

854
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,240
um short staffed high pressure you name

855
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:25,240
it so if you're plant-based you never

856
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:28,639
eat a salad or anything raw in a Animal

857
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,240
product restaurant unless you ordered a

858
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,960
avocado but they didn't cut it open you

859
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,320
cut it open at your table you cut it

860
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,359
open say do you have an avocado here

861
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,560
bring me an avocado bring me a couple of

862
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:42,440
avocados and you cut them open right

863
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,639
there and you scoop them out on top of

864
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,040
your plate that's just an example that's

865
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,760
one way of eating out there but hey

866
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,879
that's no fun I get it so what you do is

867
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,159
you order cooked so if you're

868
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,160
plant-based for example if you're

869
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,480
plant-based and vegetarian so forth you

870
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,640
want to order cooked there's no question

871
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,280
it has to be cooked but that's not all

872
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,000
it has to come hot has to come hot you

873
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,480
can order a cooked dish they might have

874
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,720
a couscous dish or something or quinoa

875
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,320
dish in a restaurant fancy restaurant

876
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,480
that's also serving all kinds of animal

877
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,000
products but that quinoa dish has been

878
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,000
cold sitting in the refrigerator it was

879
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,640
already pre-made a day before okay and

880
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,320
they say oh this this num skull wants uh

881
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,160
this num skull is a plant-based person

882
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,720
and they want they want now the quino

883
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,599
dish they're picking let's we can't make

884
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,200
fresh quinoa right now let's pull the

885
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,920
the pre-made quinoa dish out of the

886
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,440
fridge it was sitting right next to all

887
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,800
the chickens and and raw chickens and

888
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,440
raw meats let's just warm it up really

889
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,520
quick in the microwave or we'll warm it

890
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,640
up in the pan really quick and it's

891
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,320
it'ss right there on the pan and a lot

892
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,200
of times it doesn't get heated all the

893
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,240
way through then in restaurants they

894
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,960
have sauces lots of sauces and squeezy

895
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,920
bottles there's so much

896
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,839
cross-contamination in all the squeezy

897
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,319
bottles in restaurants high quality

898
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,319
restaurants of all kinds of levels of

899
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,960
salmonella and bacteria E coli sitting

900
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:05,800
in those squeezy bottles because the

901
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,560
sauces are prepared around raw chicken

902
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,680
and raw meats all the time and people's

903
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,599
hands are dirty and they're just they're

904
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,760
just you know putting it all in those

905
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,839
containers The Squeeze bottles and you

906
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,480
get your quinoa dish right out right

907
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,280
even if it came out hot in that moment

908
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,200
after you heated it up or she heated it

909
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,800
up the chef did then they squirt cold or

910
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,240
lukewarm unheated sauce right on top of

911
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,440
that and bring it to you so here's the

912
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,560
deal you know tell them you want no

913
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,480
sauces put on top afterward if you can

914
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,160
tell them you want it hot you want the

915
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,760
plate hot you want the dish hot if it

916
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,160
comes lukewarm you send it back in a

917
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,680
nice way because you don't want to get

918
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,119
anybody upset in restaurants that's

919
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,520
another thing I learned too okay you

920
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,079
don't want to get anybody upset you

921
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,359
don't know who really is got an axe to

922
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,839
grind or whatever and you don't know

923
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,880
what can happen to your dish if you piss

924
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,880
off someone so um that's just a fact I'm

925
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,640
just telling you right now so the deal

926
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,800
is is that and where did I where did I

927
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,960
even get that information from having so

928
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,880
many clients who worked in the

929
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,720
restaurant business in all kinds of

930
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,280
different ways so many hundreds of

931
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,520
clients over the years over the last

932
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,640
three decades and I've heard

933
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,440
stories I just couldn't even repeat so

934
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,560
the point is is in a nice way you get

935
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,160
your plate brought back hot you don't

936
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,160
want them to redo it you just want it

937
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,440
hot

938
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,800
and so it kills off

939
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,400
everything everything so if you're vegan

940
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,839
vegetarian you do that all right that's

941
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,480
that's one way of doing it if you're if

942
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,160
you're Animal product based you still

943
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,560
want it to come back hot too just in

944
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,760
case but you not only want that you

945
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,160
don't want anything rare you don't want

946
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,480
your meat rare it's one thing you have

947
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,040
to always understand I I don't care if

948
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,800
you've been eating rare meat meat with

949
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,119
no problems you've never had food

950
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,040
poisoning you've been doing great for 20

951
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,640
years in your life 30 years you've been

952
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,200
eating meat rare at your favorite

953
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,720
restaurant there's always that day

954
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,319
there's always that day I've witnessed

955
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,119
it out there in the world you make sure

956
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:18,480
your burger whatever it is you're doing

957
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,040
grass-fed burger or just just plain old

958
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,240
USDA crap Burger whatever it is you just

959
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,400
make sure it's well done okay at least

960
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,160
medium at least medium you know to well

961
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,400
done or medium the the the least never

962
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,440
wanted rare so you can be protected in

963
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,280
restaurants that's important for both

964
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,560
meat eaters and vegans vegetarians

965
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,760
plant-based whatever you have to use

966
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,920
lemon ask in your restaurants can you

967
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,079
bring me lemons bring me a lemon bring

968
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,119
me a cut lemon or cut it yourself bring

969
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,880
me a lemon and you the good thing is if

970
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,359
they cut a lemon for you the lemon

971
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,119
should kill off a lot of the bacteria

972
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,839
that could have been on a knife but you

973
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,640
squeeze lemon on everything because the

974
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:07,200
lemon will go on top of your

975
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,680
food but also it'll go inside of you or

976
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,960
a lemon water or something you know

977
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,119
there lemon is a great antiseptic it's

978
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,200
incredible it really helps killing off

979
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,640
so if you for some reason you ordered a

980
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,400
salad and you're at a you know you're at

981
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,920
a meat eating restaurant with family and

982
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,440
you ordered a salad get a lemon squeeze

983
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,240
it all over the salad make sure that

984
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,599
lemon juices on there and maybe even a

985
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,599
pinch of salt if they can bring you some

986
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,200
fresh salt like a sea salt if they have

987
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,000
high quality salt at the restaurant you

988
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,280
put a little sea salt on there it's a

989
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,760
good chance it can help kill off

990
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,359
bacteria so keep in mind that there's a

991
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,119
lot of things you can do to protect

992
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:50,040
yourself okay sure you might go into a

993
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,839
restaurant thinking much differently now

994
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,280
and and you got me to think in maybe a

995
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,920
bad way cuz now I just ruined your fun

996
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,800
but but but here's the thing don't don't

997
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,319
let it ruin your fun just realize you're

998
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,880
armed it matters you're armed you know

999
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,440
when I was a child when I was a child

1000
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,920
you know against spirit's advice I chose

1001
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,599
something in a

1002
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,920
restaurant um that I wanted I didn't

1003
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,960
care what spirit said I wanted it you

1004
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,760
know and and I was with family I was 8 n

1005
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,000
years old and uh we went out and I

1006
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,480
almost died

1007
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,560
almost died Spirit told me not to choose

1008
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,960
to take the choice but you know when

1009
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,079
you're 8 nine years old and you you get

1010
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,920
tired of hearing from Spirit you get

1011
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,400
tired if anybody's read the first book

1012
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,000
you'll know you'll know if you read the

1013
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,240
first book you read the first chapter

1014
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,280
origins of the medical medium and so you

1015
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,720
know I just said hey you I want what I

1016
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,560
want that's what I I don't care I don't

1017
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,359
want to hear Spirit on this one this I'm

1018
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,599
out with family I'm out I'm happy I want

1019
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,200
to have what makes me happy and so you

1020
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:03,040
know I ordered something and it nearly

1021
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,640
killed me it was agonizing absolutely

1022
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,560
agonizing and there was nothing anybody

1023
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,839
can do you go to the ER there's nothing

1024
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,520
they can do they just look at you look

1025
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,680
at you if you're in that much Agony or

1026
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,000
in that much pain they just there's

1027
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,880
nothing they can do with food poisoning

1028
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,359
they just you can stay there or go home

1029
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,760
in that kind of Agony and but if you go

1030
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:23,200
home and you get dehydrated that's a

1031
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,079
problem too so you stay in the hospital

1032
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,319
and you get you hooked up to IV you know

1033
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,240
and and that's the most they can do and

1034
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,800
that agonizing pain from

1035
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,760
eoli or any kind of

1036
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,000
bug wrenching into the Linings of the

1037
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:44,880
colon wrenching into the Linings of an

1038
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,640
organ is brutal and so it's no joke and

1039
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,359
I got away from it I got lucky you know

1040
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,760
I was still sick for weeks and it was

1041
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,119
until spirit said look you have to get

1042
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:01,520
pairs from your great-grandfather 's

1043
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:04,680
tree and you have to eat just paars

1044
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,040
only and only paars and I recovered

1045
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,480
rapidly because of it you know I had

1046
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,160
Spirit to to thank for that of course to

1047
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,440
be there but Spirit gets mad at me many

1048
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,760
times and someone said well how can

1049
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,319
Spirit get mad spirit's supposed to be

1050
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,800
the source no Spirit gets Spirit gets

1051
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,400
upset with me

1052
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,520
absolutely Spirit knows that hey I made

1053
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,280
the choice against spirit Spirit wasn't

1054
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,599
pleased at all and Spirit had to get me

1055
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:35,040
out of it and yank me and pull me out of

1056
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,839
it and yeah yeah and so with this just

1057
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,920
know that we can get sick I've seen

1058
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,599
hundreds of cases over the years people

1059
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,400
in some dire dire situations so we're

1060
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,040
going to go into another part of of of

1061
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,760
talking about this so we can figure it

1062
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,800
out so let's talk about other safety

1063
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,760
measures that matter garlic and food

1064
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,319
garlic and food's really important so

1065
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,680
say you're just you know say you love

1066
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,200
animal products but you also like a

1067
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,599
salad too when you're in that restaurant

1068
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,079
and you know I don't recommend doing a

1069
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,640
salad I recommend all your food being

1070
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,839
cooked in that restaurant like I said

1071
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
earlier and and asking for the plates to

1072
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,359
come

1073
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,880
hot and so um and and by the way in

1074
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,040
restaurants that happens all the time is

1075
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,920
the juices from a raw steak are still on

1076
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,720
a plate and in restaurants they actually

1077
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,880
take the steak off the grill or whatever

1078
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,200
it is in the restaurant or out of the

1079
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,200
oven or out of the broiler whatever it

1080
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,680
is and they put it they put it right on

1081
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,000
that that that

1082
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,359
plate with the raw juice is still there

1083
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,839
underneath the steak so that's really

1084
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,359
common practice so that's why you want

1085
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,000
it coming back hot um the plate hot too

1086
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,040
if you can but another safety measure is

1087
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,079
garlic garlic on your salads garlic on

1088
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,920
your food garlic in your dishes you

1089
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,599
order that quinoa dish garlic involved

1090
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,839
in there anywhere with it's cooked raw

1091
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,640
very helpful raw Garlic's best but it's

1092
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,599
a safety measure to make sure that in

1093
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,720
your stone stomach if you have bacteria

1094
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,160
in there percolating with everything

1095
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,559
else that's in your stomach if you

1096
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,920
garlic in there Garlic's so powerful

1097
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,200
that it just will spread through the

1098
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,480
entire stomach killing off bacteria so

1099
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,640
that's a great safety measure for when

1100
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,800
you're eating out um another safety

1101
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:20,359
measure before you eat out oregano

1102
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,680
capsule take an oregano capsule take one

1103
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:25,319
it's all you need is one and you

1104
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,599
literally it could mean saving you from

1105
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:29,480
food poisoning

1106
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,160
so hey going to go out to lunch uh with

1107
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,559
everybody or whatever it is have an

1108
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,319
oregano capsule before you go out to

1109
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,480
lunch that oregano capsule will open up

1110
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,760
it'll be in your stomach nice and ready

1111
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,520
food will go down it'll disperse all

1112
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,440
around the food very helpful becomes a

1113
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,760
safety barrier so salmonella and eoli

1114
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,200
can't run a muck and start going

1115
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,559
becoming really

1116
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,640
unruly and because it'll run right into

1117
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,400
that oregano oil so that's a secret

1118
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,000
weapon so I want you guys to focus on

1119
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:06,440
that if you can um so the oregano the

1120
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,520
oregano is important um time time on

1121
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,599
your food but it's hard restaurants you

1122
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,319
know you ask for some time that's a

1123
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,319
tough one what can you do you know that

1124
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,440
that's a that's a harder one to to uh do

1125
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:20,760
but peppermint Believe It or Not

1126
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,960
peppermint tea is always in restaurants

1127
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,200
peppermint tea is

1128
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,200
antibacterial it's antibacterial it's

1129
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,720
not really anti viral too much but it's

1130
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,440
antibacterial which just reminded me so

1131
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,480
the whole thing the reason why you want

1132
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,760
your plates coming back hot your food

1133
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,880
coming back hot in case the chef does

1134
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,880
have a cut finger that they've been kind

1135
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,160
of Nursing and it's been seeping over

1136
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,880
time and getting into different food and

1137
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,880
everything else just in case the chef

1138
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,520
has mononucleosis doesn't know it and is

1139
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,800
sweating drip dripping sweat into your

1140
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,839
food that's another thing too because if

1141
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,160
when this when the chefs are sweating

1142
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:02,280
profusely and it's dropping in all your

1143
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,240
food right there over the fire that

1144
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,000
though that sweat will probably get

1145
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,559
heated up and burned up as they're

1146
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,280
preparing your food but it's the sweat

1147
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,680
that's still coming off the chef when

1148
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,920
the food's been pulled off the griddle

1149
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,599
and put into your plate and he's

1150
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,839
prepping the plate with that little bit

1151
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
of little bit of cilantro they put on

1152
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,839
top and a cute little sauce they put

1153
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,880
remember those sauces look out for them

1154
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,640
sauces they put that sauce that ring of

1155
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,119
sauce around your

1156
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,880
plate and and uh which by the way needs

1157
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,520
to be heated up that plate needs to be

1158
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,000
hot because the sweat dripping off the

1159
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,640
chef dropping into your food and if it's

1160
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,400
not hot enough you can be set up for

1161
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,359
mononucleosis a new a new variety and

1162
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,640
God knows we got enough varieties out

1163
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,440
there we talk about that in all the

1164
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,119
different shows so so that's something

1165
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,760
to be concerned that's why your food has

1166
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,480
to come back hot always remember that

1167
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,400
but the safety measure of oregano oil is

1168
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,760
incredible peppermint tea at the

1169
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,400
restaurant great for antibacterial you

1170
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,720
could sip a little bit of peppermint tea

1171
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,200
before your food comes sip it after your

1172
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,960
food comes it's a secret weapon in fact

1173
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,040
it's people do that anyway without

1174
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,720
realizing it and it stops food poisoning

1175
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,640
cases and they didn't even know it they

1176
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,280
got off scot-free without realizing it

1177
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,760
because they had garlic in their food

1178
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,760
because they had some peppermint tea but

1179
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:24,680
I really like the oregano capsules um

1180
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,520
that's that's a big deal so here's the

1181
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,319
deal you get sick get food poisoning

1182
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,880
you're vomiting you got diarrhea there's

1183
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,200
not much you can do but you can try to

1184
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,119
sip coconut water coconut water a little

1185
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,599
bit of coconut water mixed with regular

1186
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,680
water it's a secret weapon to try to get

1187
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,520
hydrated as quick as possible could even

1188
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,240
be in a bottle coconut water canned B

1189
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,119
coconut water and you put a little bit

1190
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,760
of coconut water in with regular water

1191
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,119
and sip it in between bouts of vomiting

1192
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,880
bouts of diarrhea no vomiting anymore

1193
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,480
and you just have diarrhea and gut pain

1194
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,079
sipping the coconut water very important

1195
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,680
getting little sips in if you can if

1196
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,720
your tummy can feel like it can handle

1197
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,079
it hold it down lemon water squeeze the

1198
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,119
lemon in water and sipping little bits

1199
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,920
of lemon water between it all you might

1200
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,040
not have a bad case of it your body

1201
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,880
might be cleaning up it might not be a a

1202
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,800
bad kind of eoli it might not be a bad

1203
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,319
kind of

1204
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:22,760
salmonella might not be a bad you know

1205
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,680
um um version of another bacteria but

1206
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,160
you you can do the lemon water sipping

1207
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,640
in between the coconut water sipping in

1208
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,040
between Ginger water ginger tea in in

1209
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,920
restaurants um Regular conventional

1210
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,000
restaurants that serve uh salads meat

1211
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,040
whatever you know plant-based options

1212
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,960
and you know regular meat eating options

1213
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,520
often carry ginger tea lately so you

1214
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,160
know you can call ahead and say what

1215
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,920
kind of herbal teas you could bring your

1216
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,680
own tea bags never feel uncomfortable to

1217
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,799
bring your own secret weapons to

1218
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,559
restaurants can really protect yourself

1219
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:57,119
so it's not about being in fear it's

1220
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,640
it's about being armed like I said

1221
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,000
before this is critical information you

1222
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,680
bring it you bring your ginger tea bags

1223
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,720
put it in your purse put in your wallet

1224
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,119
I don't know if it goes good in the

1225
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,559
wallet have it in your pocket when

1226
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,280
you're going out to dinner and and you

1227
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,520
know and they don't have ginger tea you

1228
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,880
have your ginger tea bag Ginger kills

1229
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,920
bacteria right in the stomach you can

1230
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,559
sip it before you eat have some ginger

1231
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,760
tea after you eat it's an amazing

1232
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:28,319
protection weapon um method you know

1233
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,839
it's perfect so these are these are some

1234
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,400
of the tricks that you have to do like I

1235
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:34,280
said squeeze lemon on all your food too

1236
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,200
that's an option too take a lemon to a

1237
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,240
restaurant pick a lemon okay because

1238
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,839
they might not have a lemon squeeze it

1239
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:46,160
on your salad squeeze it on your food um

1240
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,520
now um lemon is always good with any raw

1241
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,480
dishes in a vegan restaurant plant-based

1242
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,079
restaurant it's always good to have

1243
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:56,440
lemon anyway a lot of times deliveries

1244
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:59,040
of food comes from a food truck to

1245
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,599
plant-based neighborhoods you know not

1246
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,040
plant-based neighborhoods but

1247
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:06,760
plant-based um you know restaurants so

1248
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,520
what happens is the truck will have also

1249
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,720
meat frozen meat this that whatnot in

1250
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,119
there plus it'll have all the fruits and

1251
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,119
vegetables and you know and this happens

1252
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:18,240
in a lot in the cities the cities

1253
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,520
usually it happens and you're getting

1254
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,000
your drop off and you're getting your

1255
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,160
fruits and vegetables but there could

1256
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,440
have been

1257
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,520
cross-contamination so in vegan

1258
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,400
vegetarian restaurants I still would

1259
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,319
recommend cooked and not raw in those

1260
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,880
restaurants now if you do raw in those

1261
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:36,559
restaurants which could be okay make

1262
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,400
sure you ask for lemon squeezed on

1263
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,880
things and it matters and sea salt pinch

1264
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,960
of sea salt it matters and you can

1265
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,160
literally stop any kind of bacteria

1266
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,520
right in its

1267
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,040
tracks um so these are just different

1268
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,720
options but a lot of people they don't

1269
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,119
have choices they can't you know they

1270
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,640
they end up in whatever restaurant they

1271
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,559
end up in because when you're with the

1272
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,960
pool of people

1273
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,680
and you're just going where everybody's

1274
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,480
going to go and no one wants to insult

1275
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,839
someone or no one wants to push someone

1276
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,319
too hard and you end up at some any kind

1277
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,559
of dive whatever it may be you're going

1278
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:13,920
to be prepared now you bring the things

1279
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,319
you need you bring your ginger tea you

1280
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,559
bring your peppermint tea if they don't

1281
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:20,760
already have it you know what to do with

1282
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:24,319
the lemon you do the oregano oil capsule

1283
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,240
before eating out every time it's such a

1284
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,680
good safety me measure it's not even

1285
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,839
funny it's so good it really can help

1286
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,440
you know if you do get sick you know how

1287
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,079
to hydrate yourself carefully between it

1288
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,240
all if you're that sick you know you

1289
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,119
have to get to the hospital for an

1290
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,040
IV and if you

1291
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,720
know if you know these things you can

1292
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,599
arm yourself and protect yourself when

1293
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,400
you're preparing like I said all the

1294
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,240
different meats and the chickens and

1295
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,520
everything in your own kitchens be

1296
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,400
careful be careful you know they I mean

1297
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,839
I see it look I see it with a cooking

1298
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,119
channel once in a while when I'm over a

1299
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,680
family member's house and they got the

1300
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:05,040
cooking show on and I'm standing there

1301
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,599
watching it I see literally they just

1302
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,880
you know some of the chefs they don't

1303
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,240
even they don't even wash their hands

1304
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,720
they're playing around with raw chicken

1305
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,440
and they're running around playing a raw

1306
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,599
like like there's nothing wrong or

1307
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,280
nothing going on and then playing around

1308
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:19,119
with raw meat like there's nothing going

1309
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,480
on never have steak tartar or whatever

1310
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,000
that is that whole raw meat thing um

1311
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,000
that's a guaranteed way of of possibly

1312
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,559
losing your life even if you've done it

1313
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,480
over the years and you've gotten away

1314
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:34,160
with it there's times where we may not

1315
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,440
get away with it stories of people I've

1316
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,799
heard from people losing their lives

1317
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,680
getting sick doctors telling me about it

1318
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:43,640
and everything else from food poisoning

1319
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,119
is devastating lots of appendix appendix

1320
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,720
operations aidomes lots of those because

1321
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:51,640
of it lots of gallbladders removed

1322
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,920
because of it um and a lot of ulcerative

1323
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,040
ulcerative and and uh issues created

1324
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,760
because of it a lot lot of damaged

1325
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,319
Linings intestinal tracts and colons um

1326
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,319
it's no joke but we can we can clean up

1327
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:10,240
if you had food food poisoning weigh in

1328
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:12,839
the past a long time ago anything you do

1329
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,480
applying in any of these shows helps

1330
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,079
knock down bacteria helps knock down old

1331
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,720
bacteria whether it's old sea diff

1332
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,640
sitting in there that's that's been just

1333
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,680
you know sitting around not doing much

1334
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,720
or you know anything streps strep gets

1335
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,359
in food too all these different streps

1336
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,720
get in food they're on animal products

1337
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,960
and everything when you go into the like

1338
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,960
I said when you go into the stores the

1339
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,319
stores the packaged animal products are

1340
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,480
loaded with almost

1341
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,400
virtually a dozen varieties of bacteria

1342
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,079
MCA being included and ciff being

1343
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,559
included so these are all the things to

1344
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,480
keep in mind does it mean stop eating

1345
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,720
animal products no if that's what you

1346
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,200
like to do um if that's what you feels

1347
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,960
right if that's what you subscribe to it

1348
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,359
doesn't mean stop stop eating a raw

1349
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,760
salad you know at a plant-based

1350
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,520
restaurant if you're plant-based or

1351
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,160
vegan whatever it is no you can do it

1352
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:07,559
just just take a lot of these measures

1353
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:11,200
be you know be on it be on it and you

1354
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:13,400
can protect yourself and your family and

1355
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,760
the whole bid we're going to have to do

1356
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,240
a part two on this one someday so uh

1357
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,960
hang in there because I feel like I just

1358
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,200
scratched the surface I feel like I've

1359
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,359
been swimming in scratching the surface

1360
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,400
but haven't really pulled the whole

1361
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:28,079
thing together 100% with some of the

1362
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,040
