00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,519
and all kinds of other reasons and i'll

99
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
talk about that so i'm going to show you

100
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,560
that too

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
i got the weinman's wild blueberry juice

102
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
it's something i do every single day

103
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
i'm not sponsored by traditional

104
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
medicinals

105
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
just a little forewarning there not

106
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,959
sponsored by these guys

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
i'm not sponsored by vimergy this is

108
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
stuff

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,799
i do every single day okay i am working

110
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,319
with wyman's to make sure this stuff

111
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
gets out there in the world because it's

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,799
incredible right

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
all these different reasons i've talked

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,599
about that before but

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
so as far as the t's go i make a really

116
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,920
really strong brew and i'll do

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,439
i'll do multiple teas in a day okay so

118
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
that's something i'll do

119
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
so i'll get a really strong hibiscus

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,599
rose hip in the morning

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
what i like about the rose hips is it's

122
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,799
great for the immune system

123
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,200
and right now we have to keep our immune

124
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
system strong so what you'll find

125
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,680
in here is a lot of powerful immune

126
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
system builders and boosters right and

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,519
i'm going to be doing

128
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
multiple lives on this topic right here

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,239
not just what i take in a day but i'm

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,919
going to do it a million

131
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
immune system builder one i'm going to

132
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,280
do a baseline supplement one two

133
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,960
so i'm dropping some tea bags in here

134
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,400
so there's one right there and

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,000
there's two right

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,639
okay and then three

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,400
right so i'm doing three rows hip with

138
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,880
hibiscus

139
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,479
so i usually do this sometime in the

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
morning you know you can

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
i don't know what you guys you know if

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
you do any teas in the morning but

143
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,120
that's one right there

144
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
i'll drop some honey in there too

145
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,520
yeah that's hot water

146
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,520
so i'm gonna drop some honey right there

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,000
so that's that's one of

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,120
now i do a lot of tea just so you guys

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,639
know a lot of tea which you won't see me

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,479
doing is green tea

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
you won't see me trying to destroy my

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
adrenal glands

153
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
and what you guys are going to be doing

154
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
what's going to happen out there is you

155
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
guys are going to be

156
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,919
they're going to try to brainwash you

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
guys they're going to try to brainwash

158
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,120
you to have your green tea

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
to make sure that every woman's on green

160
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
tea or matcha tea or some kind of coffee

161
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,000
and i talk about that being bad right

162
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,840
and all that stuff

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,320
but it do you see me drinking green tea

164
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
do you see me drinking matcha tea right

165
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,880
do you see me drinking coffee you don't

166
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
see that there's a reason because

167
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,160
green tea matcha tea coffee those are

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,039
adrenal destroyers for women especially

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
for women

170
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
good to see you guys healthy liz good to

171
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,360
see you

172
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,800
so those are adrenal destroyers

173
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,479
annihilators so it's funny how the

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
industry the health industry works okay

175
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
it's one thing the caffeine industry is

176
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
one thing right

177
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,120
but it's not just that it's the

178
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,039
alternative medicine industry and the

179
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,520
alternative medicine medicine industry

180
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
is

181
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,440
is such a game like a tricky

182
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,240
game and it's a game to really hurt

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,039
women more than people know and men too

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,919
so they'll just push all that caffeine

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,000
into women

186
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,520
and they'll age them quick now i don't

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
know why alternative medicine loves to

188
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
do that but they do

189
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,680
and it's all paid for stuff it's all

190
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
paid for

191
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
stuff just you know so there's that game

192
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,280

caffeinated because you don't want that

196
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,599
you definitely don't want that that's

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
important to know

198
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,440

okay and i'll do the same thing i'll do

208
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,400
three tea bags right there

209
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,520
and this is a great way to get

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,280
minerals trace minerals in you guys this

211
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,479
is herbal medicine so i'm all about

212
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
herbal medicine

213
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,840
but i'm not about stupid herbal medicine

214
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
there's a difference and i'll go into

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
what that means

216
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,639
uma do you do you do tea after celery

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,400
juice sure

218
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,879
yeah 15 to 30 minutes later absolutely

219
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,400
i definitely do

220
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
so i'm going to do another cup of tea

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
right here

222
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
using herbal medicine properly is how

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,039
you heal

224
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
just so you know using herbal medicine

225
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,280
properly is how you heal and i'm going

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
to cover

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
a whole bunch of different things that i

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,879
take i got all the supplements here

229
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
right here

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
all the different stuff that i do every

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,520
single day

232
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,919
i take lysine every day jody k

233
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,479
can you overdo it with supplements i

234
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,599
heard too many can affect the liver

235
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,759
too many useless supplements

236
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,280
too many supplements that aren't good

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
for people to take

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,800
there's a big difference like

239
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,000
supplements and then there's crap

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,520
or supplements and trendy garbage or

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,039
supplements and um

242
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
junk so let's give you a couple of a

243
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,320
couple of things fish oil

244
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
yeah you can overdo it any of it's

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
overdue because it's terrible for you

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
right

247
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
so if you're like well i'm taking my

248
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,760
supplements i'm doing my fish oil well

249
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,160
that's that's that's a disaster

250
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,680
because of of the mercury that's in fish

251
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
oil and i don't care what anybody says

252
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,600
there's mercury and fish oil in fact

253
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,040
it's even worse than what people believe

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
because they try to remove mercury

255
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
artificial and then it makes it worse

256
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
because you have the homeopathic version

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
of mercury inside fish oil which goes

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,320
straight to the brain

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,160
straight to the brain stem okay so

260
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,800
so that's just an example right there

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,480
like sodium bicarbonate bentonite clay

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,720
apple cider vinegar gummies like all

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
this is garbage colostrum

264
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
collagen right zeolite all of this is

265
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
garbage and so

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,480
yeah you can overdo it when you do

267
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
zeolite because you like you're not

268
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
supposed to be doing

269
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
you can overdo it when you do whey

270
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
protein powder because you're not

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
supposed to be doing it

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
you can overdo bentonite clay because

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
you're not supposed to be doing it you

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
can overdo humic and fulvic acid

275
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
because you're not supposed to be doing

276
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,839
it because this stuff isn't good for you

277
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
and that's the scam of the alternative

278
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
industry too

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,839
it's all they have to give you so much

280
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
to choose from

281
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
that you shouldn't be doing because it's

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
it's garbage

283
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
if your doctor wants you on it be on it

284
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,800
okay but i wouldn't go on it i wouldn't

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
put family and friends on it i wouldn't

286
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
put any of the people that have reached

287
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
out to me throughout the

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,399
throughout my life you know i wouldn't i

289
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,240
wouldn't put anybody on that so

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,519
so i'm doing red raspberry leaf right

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,120
here i'm doing there's herbal medicine

292
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,680
and then there's herbal medicine

293
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320

powerful no fillers no garbage no

376
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,320
nothing

377
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
and i and and that's the thing it's like

378
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
that matters to me

379
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,200
but also really potent at the same time

380
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
as gentle so

381
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,760
the lemon balm is an incredible healing

382
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,839
tool for so many people

383
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
no citric acid no natural flavors no

384
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
alcohol it's it's really incredible so

385
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
let's go into this a little bit

386
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
how much do i take right

387
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,399
so it's just moving this around a little

388
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,839
bit so you guys can see

389
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
okay so how much do i take

390
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,839
try not to let disaster happen over here

391
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
like spilling everything

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,320
so that's one dropper full right there

393
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,639
maybe somebody you're just taking one

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
dropper full maybe somebody that takes

395
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,760
a one drop one drop

396
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,920
right and but this is what i do so i'll

397
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,920
put

398
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,079
two dropper fulls two full dropper fulls

399
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,399
right

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,399
three

401
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
four

402
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,639
five

403
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,320
six so i take six full dropper holes of

404
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,240
lemon balm right there

405
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,079
put them in a shot glass that's what i

406
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
do that's my shot glass right there

407
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
and i add a little water

408
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
huh put a little bit of water in there

409
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,120
so i just made a lemon balm

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
shot that's what it did it's a lemon

411
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,279
balm

412
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
now this is a tool used correctly right

413
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,560
here

414
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
it's the right kind of lemon balm right

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
kind of lemon

416
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,959
lemon balm product and already that's a

417
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,199
win-win because what people don't

418
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,880
understand is you get a lemon balm out

419
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,720
there that's an alcohol with natural

420
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,519
flavors or anything you get a lemon balm

421
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
that's

422
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
not not it's got fillers in it or it's

423
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
just a weak

424
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,320
weak version you know nasa says zeolite

425
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
is garbage i read that it is okay in

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
your book medical medium i'm glad you

427
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,160
asked that i'm going to cover that too

428
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,240
why that was there

429
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,040
because just like i will i will drop

430
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,120
anything that i think changes if a

431
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,680
product is changing

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
they're dead to me that's it and there

433
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
hasn't been a zeolite out not even to

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
this day i know everybody screams the

435
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
light and all the stuff

436
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
they're not good okay in my opinion

437
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,519
they're not good

438
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,320
and they dehydrate they remove

439
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,199
important trace minerals there was a

440
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,279
zeolite

441
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,199
that was okay enough at the time when

442
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,399
dulce wasn't present

443
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,079
right but it's it's not okay enough

444
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,920
and what people do is they do large

445
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,160
dosages of zeolite the whole thing and

446
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,440
they're using the wrong zeolites

447
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,120
and and um so yeah so

448
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
the only reason why i offered zeolite at

449
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,880
one point there was a certain variety of

450
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,639
zeolite out at the time

451
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,199
and small dosages it would help get

452
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
some debris out of the intestinal tract

453
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,720
but it can't cross the barrier of

454
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
intestinal tract it can't go into the

455
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,759
bloodstream

456
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,199
it can't very easily it can't go into

457
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,279
places you need to go in

458
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,800
and the z lights today are not the right

459
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
kind so i just want to just

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
make that clear and how that works so

461
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,639
but what you'll find

462
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,240
is the heavy metal detox smoothie which

463
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,160
is the spirulina

464
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
and the barley grass juice powder right

465
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
heavy metal detox movie

466
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,920
that's helping people heal around the

467
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,079
world people are trying to

468
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,199
hop on that boat that bandwagon so

469
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,120
they'll say hey

470
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,639
do the z light 2 with your heavy metal

471
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,560
detox smoothie

472
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
and then they try to take credit for

473
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
what the medical medium heavy metal

474
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
detox smoothie does

475
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
zeolite in the last 20 years hasn't done

476
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,079
anything for anybody somebody has lupus

477
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,240
or ra or hashimoto's they

478
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,839
keeps with their ra their hashimoto's

479
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
their neurological line they keep with

480
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
their lupus they keep with their

481
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,079
conditions

482
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
zeolite doesn't change that same thing

483
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,040
with like humic acid fulfilling acid

484
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
it dehydrates the body it doesn't give

485
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,079
back

486
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,959
it takes and it doesn't get people out

487
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,720
of sickness

488
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,560
medical medium info is about getting

489
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,680
people out of sickness

490
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,880
disease illness struggles

491
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,160
symptoms and doing it right so

492
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,079
you know there's people out there the

493
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
user of all medicine they use it wrong

494
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,240
so i'm showing a great way of how to use

495
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,439
it can ask your doctor what's right for

496
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,039
you but this is how i use it for my

497
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,480
friends and family so this is a

498
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,760
lemon bomb okay shot right there

499
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
and i take this every day

500
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,600
if you're watching this on youtube give

501
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,160
me a thumbs up if you want

502
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,880
so that's a lemon balm shot now i take

503
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,960
those throughout the day

504
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
kathy hill will the lemon balm tea be

505
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
just as good

506
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
as the tincture it's not as good as the

507
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
tincture

508
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,200
but i like the lemon balm tea and i like

509
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,360
traditional medicinals lemon balm tea

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,480
that's the peppermint right there

511
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,720
but it's not as good as

512
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
the tincture but it's still helpful so

513
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
if you have the lemon balm tea drink it

514
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,000
drink it drink it if you like that

515
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,200
that's fine but this is more of

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
heading to that that extra medicinal

517
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
that

518
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,919
powerful level of a healing tool

519
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
so that's why i do it with the tincture

520
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,600
takes it to that whole another thing

521
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
so that's what i do with the lemon balm

522
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,880
i do that every day so the thing is the

523
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
question is i've never showed you guys

524
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,679

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440

the reasons why i don't show you guys

is it could overwhelm you you know

642
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,840
that's all because you might say wait a

643
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400

644
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,520

649
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,000

they listen to you they really do that's

663
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
what i love about them they care about

664
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,720
you and they run

665
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,000
heavy metal testing on all their

666
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,039
supplements they do by an independent

667
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,679
independent testing

668
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,039
organization not one that's not

669
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,159
independent which all the others do

670
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,440
that says everything right there linda

671
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,360
says can you say

672
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,200
something about vitamin b12 how much and

673
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
how long to take i'll go to b12 next of

674
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,960
what i do

675
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
that's the vimergy b12 i'll talk about

676
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,640
why i take it

677
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
okay all of that so let's head there let

678
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,080
me get the shot glass out

679
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,520
now b12 i take orally a lot of times i

680
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
just put it directly in my mouth but i

681
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,120
also do the shot glass too

682
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
so go into that a little bit i want to

683
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,279
mention something though

684
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,200
about uh vimorji being good to you okay

685
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,039
because i know you said that right

686
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
and they've always been so good to you i

687
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,840
want to tell you how i even

688
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,240
like went into this whole thing of why

689
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,880
this is my one of my favorites okay

690
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,279
because the quality is is far surpass

691
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
any

692
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,200
spirulina so this is spirulina the

693
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,559
reason why i mention this is because

694
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,000
i used to i used to be supportive

695
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,760
of pacifica spirulina right so west

696
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,320
coast spirulina

697
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,919
and a couple of things went wrong there

698
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,039
all right

699
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
one of the west coast companies they i

700
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,039
found

701
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,440
something in their bottle and

702
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,120
i never spoke about this before but i

703
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,600
found something in their bottle

704
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,039
it was a little piece of plastic that

705
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,480
was this big

706
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,679
like a little tiny thin square

707
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,120
that was the color of

708
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,640
the spirulina i could have accidentally

709
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,480
swallowed it

710
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
and i and and because of spirit of

711
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,919
compassion i didn't

712
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,679
i never told you about this story it's a

713
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,320
private story it's like only my family

714
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
knows this

715
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,840
a couple of my friends i told the story

716
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,720
right and

717
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,400
so like i went to the bottle with the

718
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
spoon

719
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,559
and it was so thin and small by far

720
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,000
anybody else would have swallowed that

721
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,840
and i i was really upset so i was like

722
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
well what do i do

723
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
it looked like it could have been maybe

724
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,080
one of the fresheners that are inside

725
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,480
these things

726
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
but something was wrong this was so

727
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,799
easily

728
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,880
a problem and so i called the company

729
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,080
told them who i was on the medical

730
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559

and then when i found this piece of

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,279
plastic this piece of

747
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,000
this dangerous thing in there i reached

748
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,679
out to them

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it's like give me a call back i found

750
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,279
this in this and this they never did

751
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,640
and i was like that's it done

752
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,600
no recommendations for me it's over

753
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,360
you know strike two and then the oceans

754
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
got more polluted recently just in the

755
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,400
last few years the last three years

756
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
the west coast water is so polluted sea

757
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,080
life is actually

758
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,360
being forced to come closer to the shore

759
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,559
and that's why so many people are with

760
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
their videos and their cameras like oh

761
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,919
my god i see another shark

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,600
i see another porpoise i see another i

763
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,799
see another whale i see another this the

764
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,720
reason why is because there's no more

765
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,960
ocean left out there in the west coast

766
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,880
because it's it's a garbage patch now so

767
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,760
everybody's everything's being pushed to

768
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
this to the

769
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,520
edge and so i'm done with the whole

770
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
pacifica

771
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,120
spirulina done like i can't even tell

772
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,799
you

773
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,720
and that's the best stuff on the market

774
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,720
right there is the vimergy which is not

775
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,520
pacifica and it's the best stuff so it's

776
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,240
vimergy v

777
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,799
i m e rgy so talk about that in a little

778
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
bit

779
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,000
this is this is like more purse this

780
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,600
whole i i

781
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
i'm always personal with you guys duh

782
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,480
right i always am

783
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,640
but this is more like okay what is a w

784
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,080
doing what where's the fly on the wall

785
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,159
on aw

786
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,520
like who's gonna be the [ __ ] where's the

787
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,600
fly on the wall

788
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,520
with aw at ew's house right so yeah

789
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,440
can you say something about vitamin b12

790
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,240
how much and how long to take this

791
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
vitamin b12 and blood can be on a high

792
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,880
level

793
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,039
what do you recommend i noticed that i

794
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,120
needed a little bit every day

795
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,799
without i get symptoms okay here's the

796
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,720
things you get symptoms right

797
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,320
if you don't take it but yet you have

798
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,919
high b12 right

799
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
see that's the problem the industry

800
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
doesn't know alternative medicine

801
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,960
doesn't know

802
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,159
how b12 works with this okay

803
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,679
is that it's okay if levels are high

804
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,960
do what your doctor says though your

805
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,320
doctor doesn't like something you just

806
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,760
listen to them i'm just telling you that

807
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
what i would tell my family member if a

808
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,000
family member

809
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,799
had high b12 i wouldn't say stop

810
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
taking the b12 because it's helping your

811
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,760
symptoms get better because

812
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,279
what they don't measure and what they

813
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
can't measure

814
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,760
is how much b12 your central nervous

815
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,640
system has so what i tell my family

816
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,320
members

817
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,080
is you keep your b12 high

818
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,080
so that your central nervous system is

819
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
getting enough b12 which is your cranial

820
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,320
nerves

821
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,960
your brain stem your brain stem that

822
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,279
your brain stem is getting enough b12

823
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,559
how important that is to get enough b12

824
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,000
right

825
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,080
and and because they can't measure

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,760
how much b12 your vagus nerve needs

827
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,520
you guys see how important this is they

828
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,559
can't measure how much b12

829
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,679
your phrenic nerve needs okay

830
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,399
all in our nerve needs right your

831
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,880
cochlear nerve needs they can't they

832
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,520
can't

833
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
um your tibial nerve your you they can't

834
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,120
measure

835
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,520
how much these nerves need right sciatic

836
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,840
nerve

837
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,520
it's not you know whatever and it's not

838
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,200
cranial but trigeminal nerve facial

839
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,640
nerve they can't measure that

840
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,000
so your symptoms

841
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,480
can get worse even if you have high b12

842
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,120
and the wrong kind of b12 won't even

843
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
absorb

844
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
properly so and that's the other thing

845
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,520
this is the adenosil cobalamin

846
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,399
methylcobalamin b12

847
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,880
so i take this every day to get the b12

848
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,520
i need

849
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,000
i'm on lots of b12 i mean what i do and

850
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,080
have to have to conquer on a daily basis

851
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,360
like the amount of of stuff i have to

852
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,919
conquer on a daily basis

853
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,880
when i'm up against every day it's just

854
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,720
it's it's

855
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,799
it's absorbing you know that kind of

856
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,320
i mean you know you need that health of

857
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,000
liz only learned

858
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,880
this from you never learned this

859
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
neuro never learned this in neuro class

860
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
i'm honored list it's

861
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,919
incredible and thank you for being here

862
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,360
today by the way your support uh is so

863
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,240
helpful

864
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,159
what are the right kinds of b12 okay so

865
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,880
there's a lot of b12 products out there

866
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,840
alcohol's in there okay preservatives

867
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,240
are in there

868
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,600
it's all the bad preservatives and b12s

869
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,120
keep that in mind

870
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,880
msg natural flavors are in b12s okay

871
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,200
and then there's cyclobalamide that's a

872
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,200
bad b12 there's other there's other b

873
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,520
12s so even if you have the right kind

874
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,360
of b12 like

875
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,120
methylcobalamin doesn't mean it's the

876
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,520
right kind of b12 because

877
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,440
of how it was processed made the the

878
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,120
quality of it and everything else right

879
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,120
but the right blend is adenosine

880
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,640
cobalamin and methylcobalamin that's the

881
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,360
right blend right there

882
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
and that's it it's avemargee.com v isn't

883
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,799
victor i

884
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
am ergy.com i'm gonna say their name

885
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
because you guys

886
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,960
a bunch of people are gonna be like whoa

887
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
where do you get that you know what do

888
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
we do whatever whatever so i'm letting

889
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
you know

890
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,159
and if you just came on here i'm not

891
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
sponsored by these guys i'm not the

892
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,039
owner of the company

893
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
if i owned a supplement company i say

894
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,399
this all the time if i owned a tea

895
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,960
company supplement company or whatever

896
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,480
you'd see medical medium across the

897
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,960
front

898
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:05,360
right so what i'm doing here is

899
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,159
four dropper fulls of b12 right

900
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,640
murray hell taylor why did you switch

901
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,000
the b12 you were recommending two years

902
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
ago

903
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,760
because i always go to the better the

904
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,919
better b12

905
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,279
that's why i don't think it was two

906
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,640
years ago it could have been

907
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,399
three years ago um

908
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,240
could have been four years ago not sure

909
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,640
how long ago uh

910
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,559
but when a better one comes out i don't

911
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,600
have loyalty

912
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,880
to the one that's not as good there's

913
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,480
something to be said about that i've

914
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,159
seen people what happens is people who

915
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,120
are involved in the supplement world

916
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,679
right um the meaning like they're being

917
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,880
endorsed or paid or sponsored

918
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,799
or they own the company right they even

919
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,720
if their product is garbage they stand

920
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,600
behind their garbage product

921
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,399
so i don't have that loyalty i'm not

922
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,760
chained

923
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,760
to a company for loyalty if the b12

924
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,320
product is not as good and there's one

925
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,039
better

926
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,399
then guess what i'm on to the better one

927
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,559
and guess what

928
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,000

which re reminds me of something right

958
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,559
so that's four dropper fulls of b12 i

959
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
take that um

960
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,120
i take that twice a day sometimes i'll

961
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,840
do six dropper holes

962
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,200
if someone does a half a drop or full

963
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,039
it's going to help

964
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
it's going to help if somebody does that

965
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,720
much

966
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,840
if someone's on a like a budget they're

967
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
worried and they're like well i don't

968
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
want

969
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,840
you know i'm not under a lot of stress

970
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
right now i just want to take a little

971
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,279
b12 just take a little b12

972
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
i tell friends you could just take a

973
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,519
little bit of b12 right there you can do

974
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,960
a quarter dropper full or something or

975
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,640
since you can just do that a lot of

976
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
people they're really sensitive

977
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,600
and that's what i love about the vimergy

978
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
products because they're force sensitive

979
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,399
people

980
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,240
a lot of people are really sensitive

981
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,559
they only need to take a little

982
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,760
so you know little is is good they get a

983
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,760
little bit in them

984
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:53,600
that's fine quality matters

985
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,840
cheap crappy junk out there

986
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,679
really holds people back it holds them

987
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
back from healing i've talked about this

988
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,120
for years

989
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,039
so garbage products holds them back

990
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,559
holds their healing back

991
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,119
so and that happens all the time right

992
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,639
so all right move on a little bit i just

993
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,359
showed you some lemon balm

994
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,919
shot right there the b12 right there now

995
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,000
i take b12 also orally so i also do it

996
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,359
this way too every day i'll drop four

997
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,159
dropper full just like that i'll try not

998
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,200
to get it on my yellow shirt

999
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:31,520
so okay let's move on to more of

1000
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,000
now like a medicinal shot right

1001
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,919
let's go into that realm okay so i'm

1002
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,960
exposed i get exposed

1003
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,720
if i you know like

1004
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,000
i like to keep my immune system strong

1005
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,159
so every

1006
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,399
day if i get especially if i'm getting

1007
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,839
exposed in some way through work

1008
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
or anything like that

1009
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,000
chelsea floyd first time i had liquid

1010
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,320
zinc from my local health food store

1011
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,440
it made me throw up i bet it did i bet

1012
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,280
it did

1013
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,200
but it was not good for sensitive

1014
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,400
stomachs i bet it wasn't it's one of my

1015
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
biggest fear out there of all the

1016
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,040
junkies

1017
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,400
zinc out there was nervous to try the

1018
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,440
vimergy one

1019
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,000
but it was so gentle no issues chelsea

1020
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,359
that means everything and that was the

1021
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,680
zinc world before

1022
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,560
vimergy came along right that was the

1023
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,599
zinc world

1024
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,599
the zinc world was you take zinc and you

1025
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,079

1026
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,079
you can't

1027
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,160
you know because of all the citric acid

1028
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,839
in it and all the garbage and junk in it

1029
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,280
that's what that is and that's why i

1030
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,720
love the vimorji

1031
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400

1032
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,800

quality of licorice itself

1110
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,880

1111
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,160
licorice

1112
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,160
it matters right to how it works so what

1113
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:25,200
i love about licorice it's anti-pathogen

1114
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:28,480
antiviral anti-bug anti-pathogen

1115
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,760
why is everybody sick

1116
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,520
with mystery illness because

1117
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,040
their nerves are inflamed from pathogens

1118
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,119
from viruses they talk about that in the

1119
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,160
medical medium books right

1120
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,599
and so their nerves are inflamed from

1121
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,320
pathogens

1122
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
so keep that in mind details matter dale

1123
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,560
right on

1124
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,040

1178
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,720
two weeks off

1179
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,720

sometimes i'll do licorice fruit

1183
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,240
straight and not take weeks off

1184
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880

too

1186
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,040
but it says in my book you do it two

1187
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,000
weeks on two weeks off it's a great way

1188
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,480
of doing it

1189
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,640

um because i was doing this

1202
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,920

1203
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,440

1204
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,240

1206
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,599
qualified too

1207
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
he's probably one of the best doctors

1208
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,880
i've ever taught and i have talked to

1209
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,599

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,560
it's just it's amazing but they do and

1294
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,800
the funny thing is is

1295
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,359
i i think i think you just have to be

1296
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,000
sick enough you know to just

1297
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,400
go around merry around and and that's

1298
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,480
just

1299
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,000
what i talk about at the colts out there

1300
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,160
because there's a difference

1301
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
like this is not a cult those are colts

1302
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,520
out there how they do it they do the

1303
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,599
brainwashing they got the power and the

1304
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,720
money behind it and it trickles down and

1305
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,640
everybody gets

1306
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,160
brainwashed it's really sick how it

1307
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
works um

1308
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
and when you really learn the medical

1309
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,640
medium tools and how to use it and

1310
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,319
you're not dabbling in it what's going

1311
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,319
to happen is here's one thing too

1312
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
you'll run across somebody dabbling in

1313
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,520
say somebody new and you'll run across

1314
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,720
somebody dabbling in the medical medium

1315
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,560
tools

1316
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,079
and they're dabbling so they're not

1317
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,520
really seeing results because they're

1318
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,040
also doing all this other stuff they're

1319
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,319
doing their colostrum and their in their

1320
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,079
collagen and their fish oil and their

1321
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,440
protein powders and their msg which they

1322
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,760
don't know in their caffeine

1323
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,720
and they're alkaline ionizer alkaline

1324
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
water machines

1325
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,760
they're doing all these things that are

1326
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,560
poisoning themselves right

1327
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,400
and then they do they dabble with a

1328
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,720
little bit of medical medium

1329
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
and it's keeping them a little stable

1330
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,599
but they don't realize it but they just

1331
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,359
don't know better and then

1332
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,440
someone runs across them and be like oh

1333
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,800
medical medium's not doing it for me no

1334
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,920
and then you that's it you lost your

1335
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,599
chance because you're gonna be like i

1336
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,839
doubt it i doubt that guy's

1337
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,880
got info the whole bit even though

1338
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,480
millions have healed

1339
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
it's just unbelievable let's go let's

1340
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
keep on moving forward we've got another

1341
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,400
shot glass so

1342
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,359
so ashwagandha

1343
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,839
sits a medical medium tools ashwagandha

1344
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,000
right

1345
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,440
it's it's always been i've always liked

1346
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,920
ashwagandha okay

1347
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
in the sense where it's a medical medium

1348
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
tool

1349
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,720
because of some of the reasons why we

1350
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,040
hear about ashwagandha

1351
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,040
stems from medical medium for 35 years

1352
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,079
okay and it's just like cat's claw cat's

1353
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,200
claw

1354
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,720
is used in neurological lyme disease

1355
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,040
right now for neurological lyme

1356
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,000
that's because of medical medium it's 35

1357
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,079
years of teaching

1358
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,680
lyme doctors fighting for lecturing

1359
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,839
about cats claw for

1360
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,359
viruses and bacteria and stuff so

1361
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,839
ashwagandha is kind of the same thing

1362
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,440
now

1363
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,440
i take ashwagandha every day

1364
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,960

separately or together okay

1369
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,000
you can take them all together if that's

1370
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,880
what you do if that's what your doctor

1371

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,880
and msg and natural flavors that's the

1416
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
stuff that's really bad

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,880
got a lot of dust in them

1421
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,280
so the one thing you'll find with

1422
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,680
powders like ashwagandha powder and

1423
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,040
herbal powders what you'll find is

1424
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,839
there's herbal dust in those

1425
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,880
powders and you guys are eating dirt and

1426
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,520
don't know it

1427
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,079
that's how it works you're eating dirt

1428
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,599
then

1429
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,920
and so what happens is when you're

1430
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,119
getting all your herbal powders

1431
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,480

tablets and and many times herbal

1434
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,920
capsules

1435
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,559
you're eating herbal dust you're eating

1436
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,760
herbal

1437
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,319
dirt you're eating you're actually

1438
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,720
eating

1439
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:02,800
dirt and dust mixed with your herbs

1440
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,480
and people don't realize that and that's

1441
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,000
that's that's

1442
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,760
that's something that gets in that

1443
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,040
people don't even realize it yeah

1444
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,640
it's how it works um but yeah there's so

1445
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,000
much to talk about i mean i can cover a

1446
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,520
million things and i'm trying to

1447
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,440
trying to harness myself a little bit

1448
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,599
because i want to give you guys

1449
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,040
enough time on what i take but i can go

1450
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,240
on forever with so much and that's

1451
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,720
what's cool we're going to do

1452
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,240
a series of these over the next like

1453
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,240
week week and a half two weeks

1454
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,920
there's people out there that will say

1455
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,000
i'm doing medical medium

1456
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,960
but they're not they're doing

1457
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,720
supplements

1458
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,160
that are bad that medical media would

1459
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,960
never recommend

1460
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,559
okay so that's they're using companies

1461
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,319
that cut corners

1462
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,079
and that's another thing too so one of

1463
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,599
the biggest scams and supplements if you

1464
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,040
want to know

1465
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,240

1466
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,760
supplement world is putting a little bit

1467
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,839

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,319
now you've got a fat capsule or a powder

1475
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
that has a little bit of everything and

1476
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,800
that's how they rip you off i know how

1477
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,920
the supplement industry works

1478
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,200
they scam you by putting a whole bunch

1479
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,599
of stuff in there

1480
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,319
slapping a label on it here's our green

1481
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,720
powder

1482
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,640
mix it's got all these different things

1483
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,240
in here it's got alfalfa in it it's got

1484
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,000
this in it that in it

1485
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,200
and it does the list a little corella in

1486
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,599
there and it does this list down the

1487
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,000
line

1488
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,440
and you get a little speck and that's

1489
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,359
how they bank

1490
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,119
they rip you off because you can't get

1491
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,040
better with this you can't get better

1492
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,640
you can't heal you can't recover with a

1493
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,240
speck

1494
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,400
of something that's not even a good

1495
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,319
quality you can't recover

1496
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,760
with just a speck thrown in there so

1497
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,040
important now all right so there's the

1498
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,200
ashwagandha

1499
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,800
okay so i did one dropper full sometimes

1500
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,960
i'll do a drop or full twice a day

1501
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,839
sometimes i'll do two twice a day today

1502
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,240
i'm doing

1503
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,240
one probably twice a day

1504
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,359
if you're not so sick you might get a

1505
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,040
tiny benefit from that technique of

1506
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,720
just a little bit of garbage in these

1507
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,839
supplements so a powder

1508
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,520
or a capsule and you're just getting a

1509
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,280
little bit of that

1510
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,040
product in the capsule a little bit of

1511
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,800
that product in the powder

1512
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,400
and you might actually benefit as a not

1513
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,000
so sick person meanwhile if you clean

1514
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
your diet as a not so sick person

1515
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,119
you take enough junky supplements you

1516
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,000
might see

1517
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,880
some difference but it's when you get

1518
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,200
sick

1519
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,720
that's when everything changes that's

1520
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,000
when all the junk and garbage out there

1521
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,680
will take you down so let's move into a

1522
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,440
couple other things

1523
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,280
got the licorice right did some cat's

1524
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,040
claw we did that so we can talk about

1525
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,480
some capsules i did some b12

1526
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,319
if you guys just got on here this

1527
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,200
vimorgy.com vs invictor i

1528
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,000
am e r g y dot com you go to i'm not

1529
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,359
sponsored by these

1530
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,040
guys but i'm showing you what i've taken

1531
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:08,319
today and how it works 5mthf right there

1532
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,599
i take that every single day 5mthf it's

1533
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,680
a methylfolate right

1534
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
best one on the markets of emergency one

1535
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,040
right

1536
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,240
so i'll take one capsule a day

1537
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,760
sometimes i'll take two pop one down now

1538
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,359
well let me get a little cup i'll use

1539
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,559
this

1540
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:30,400
so can't use that

1541
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,400
and that's what i like about live

1542
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,400
so i'll take a 5 mthf right

1543
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,160
that's funny i didn't know there were

1544
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,319
holes in this but you know what there is

1545
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:47,280
because this is a water bottle

1546
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,640
so it's a 5m thf i take every day what

1547
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,200
else do i take

1548
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,319
i take glutathione every single day

1549
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,160
there you go that's of image glutathione

1550
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,640
now i don't have a chance probably to

1551
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,319
give you every little bit about these

1552
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,640
but let's go into some other stuff i do

1553
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,359
at night

1554
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,040
so what if i can't swallow pills if i

1555
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,760
was somebody that couldn't swallow pills

1556
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,319
right

1557
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,359
i would get the powders for one at

1558
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,960
vimergy

1559
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,079
okay that's what i would do for one so i

1560
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,720
would get everything

1561
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,359
like the powders and vimergy the barley

1562
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,000
grass powder or the spirulina and then

1563
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,400
the liquids of course i would do right

1564
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,079
and then

1565
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,440
tease like i was showing you guys at the

1566
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,680
beginning the t's right

1567
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,119
and then i would open a capsule so let's

1568
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,480
go into that next

1569
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,240
okay let's grab a cup here let's open a

1570
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,640
capsule so

1571
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,799
magnesium that's something i take every

1572
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,160
single day

1573
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,160
all right so

1574
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,440
so i would open a capsule is what i

1575
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,240
would do

1576
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,920
like that and i would take it that way

1577
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,520
with open capsules and i would mix it i

1578
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,280
would mix it with oj it would mix it

1579
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,040
with anything you want to mix it

1580
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,640
some water some coconut water is a good

1581
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,160
way to mix it right there

1582
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,839
so let's talk about zinc for a little

1583
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,319
bit so zinc shock therapy is a medical

1584
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:10,559
medium tool

1585
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,400
i talked about that i might and like i

1586
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,280
said this is just about what i take

1587
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,760
in a day i'm going to be doing more

1588
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,400
lives

1589
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,160
as we go on throughout like the next two

1590
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,000
weeks about this stuff

1591
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,000
so when it comes down to zinc

1592
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,440
i'll put zinc in here

1593
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,559
the pdf that i put out went around about

1594
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,280
sink helping for the pandemic

1595
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,960
that's how the zinc thing caught on

1596
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,680
liquid zinc sulfate's the right one to

1597
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,040
use

1598
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,119
now what you're gonna see here's how

1599
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,440
medical medium information works okay

1600
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,920
here's the zinc we're using here's how

1601
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,359
medical medium information works

1602
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,920
is medical medium puts info out

1603
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,200
it spreads around through the books and

1604
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,480
through social media

1605
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,880
okay and then other people change their

1606
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,640
supplementation around medical medium so

1607
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,160
all the other companies

1608
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,079
change their supplementation around

1609
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,520
medical medium they start putting things

1610
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
in their probiotics now because

1611
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,640
probiotics don't work

1612
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,000
they never did but they start putting

1613
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,200
like a little

1614
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,480
speck of this like lysine in a probiotic

1615
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,520
because of medical medium

1616
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,520
they put a little speck of zinc in a pro

1617
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,200
probiotic or they're putting these

1618
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,799
different immune system ones they'll put

1619
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,119
a little bit of vitamin c in something

1620
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,880
now so they're they're making

1621
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,480
all these different formulas out there

1622
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,400
but ripping people off

1623
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,079
is what they're doing they're making all

1624
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,280
these different formulas and they're

1625
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,119
ripping people off

1626
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,960
and that's how they do it out there

1627
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,520
they'll put a speck of lemon balm in

1628
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,520
something

1629
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,799
a speck of zinc and something they'll

1630
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,520
add it now into their

1631
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,680
collagen so now collagen powders because

1632
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,920
medical medium hit collagen powder so

1633
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,680
hard right because i wrote about it in

1634
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,559
the books i talked about how collagen

1635
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,720
doesn't repair

1636
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,240
skin you actually need the building

1637
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,480
blocks to create collagen

1638
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,000
in your body right you guys and because

1639
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,240
medical medium was the first to put

1640
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,200
that out there that collagen itself

1641
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,160
doesn't fix your skin or your body

1642
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,359
or tissue it's it's the building blocks

1643
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,240
to make so that your

1644
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,079
body makes collagen so that was original

1645
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,520
mm info now everybody stole that

1646
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,280
info not citing it and now they're

1647
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,640
creating products for collagen building

1648
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,920
now that isn't collagen

1649
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,000
they remove the collagen and they're

1650
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,760
putting all these medical medium tools

1651
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,280
and products down so that's how it works

1652
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,680
the medical medium puts something out

1653
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,720
there

1654
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,640
like for instance zinc all right

1655
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,319
zinc is out there because of the whole

1656
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,079
the pandemic now they talk about

1657
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,440
it's important with the pandemic you see

1658
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,839
doctors talking about zinc

1659
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,280
that originated from medical medium info

1660
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,559
you know all these years and then the

1661
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,640
pdf i put out

1662
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,760
the 35 years of doing work so i'm

1663
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,720
letting you know how mm

1664
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,240
info goes around how where it originates

1665
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,839
and i'm allowed to say it

1666
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,280
because the proof is there

1667
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,880
documentation's there and the proof's

1668
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,880
there where it originates with medical

1669
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,240
medium all of this stuff

1670
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:59,119
so there's somebody new here

1671
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,119
it is what it is

1672
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,720
patrice bennett how are you anthony why

1673
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,960
do you think

1674
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,839
other vitamin companies are not as pure

1675
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,119
as vimergy

1676
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:15,200
oh money money money money

1677
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:19,119
money that's what it is

1678
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,400
right so because it you can cut corners

1679
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,839
as a supplement company

1680
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,520
you can cut corners to the point where

1681
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:26,400
you couldn't even believe

1682
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,720
and your margins are unreal you can use

1683
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,960
cut

1684
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,480
corners with fillers and you can cut

1685
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,920
corners with with lower

1686
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,520
did you know that did you know

1687
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,599
supplement companies have a choice

1688
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,640
to use high grade and low grade did you

1689
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,480
guys know that

1690
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,000
when you're a supplement company and

1691
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,920
you're buying your product

1692
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,760
bulk you can buy the different levels

1693
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,200
all supplement companies don't buy the

1694
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,480
highest level

1695
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,400
they don't they buy the lower levels

1696
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,760
and they won't go up to the higher

1697
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,280
levels

1698
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,440
so they give you junk that's how it

1699
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,559

wymans.com i'm working with them by the

1809
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,799
way

1810
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,280

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,119
here i'm working with

1813
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:24,160
because this is this

1814
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,079
i'm worried that you know that if i

1815
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,440
don't support them we could lose this

1816
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,640
product out there in the world and that

1817
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,839
would be a shame because this is an

1818
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,839
incredible product

1819
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,240
okay i mean traditional medicinals i

1820
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,839
don't need to work with them

1821
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,280
they've been like this for years they

1822
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,880
haven't changed anything

1823
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,640
for decades and and vimergy is keeping

1824
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,039
everything the same so

1825
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,720
but these guys here it's hard to make

1826
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,119
this stuff so i'm trying to

1827
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,880
i'm trying to get the word out so you

1828
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,799
know it keeps the stuff

1829
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,720
going it's so so critical all right so

1830
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,000
we're on to that a little bit so this

1831
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,079
this is

1832
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,520
my quick heavy metal detox smoothie i'll

1833
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,960

is is really a good thing i'm going to

1963
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,640
talk about a lysine

1964
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,640
i'm assuming you guys are frozen out on

1965
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,640
facebook

1966
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,040
most likely that's where i'm heavily

1967
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,040
censored

1968
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,000
all right

1969
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,199
so i got the glutathione something i

1970
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,520
take every single day that's of energy

1971
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:53,279
defined which is incredible does your

1972
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,600
regular diet not provide

1973
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,600
all of these vitamins and minerals

1974
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,400
samantha it works like this

1975
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,679
is that regular diet is you can say

1976
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,400
regular diet for

1977
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,120
thousands of years if you want hundreds

1978
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,760
of years

1979
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:12,400
but what has changed what has changed in

1980
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,880
the last hundred years

1981
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,960
radiation floating through the sky

1982
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,239
nuclear waste in

1983
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,719
places you wouldn't even believe

1984
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:23,199
chemtrails dropping crap on us every day

1985
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,760
mercury and chemicals pathogens and

1986
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,280
toxins engineered viruses released into

1987
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,719
the environment to actually just

1988
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:33,280
destroy people um epstein bars and

1989
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,480
shingles viruses left and right

1990
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,800
mutations of different strep bacteria so

1991
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:41,440
is your regular diet was it was your

1992
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,480
regular diet prepared for

1993
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,080
the onslaught of horribleness that that

1994
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,360
is upon us

1995
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,800
is your regular diet it's a good

1996
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,760
question samantha though is your regular

1997
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,560
diet

1998
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,400
there to stop fragrances from actually

1999
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,120
destroying our brains

2000
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,600
perfumes colognes the toxicity levels of

2001
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,520

diets aren't prepared for that

2051
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,000
our regular diets are prepared for the

2052
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,080
next onslaught of chemicals being

2053
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,480
you know churned out of a chemical

2054
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,800
factory put in perfumes and colognes

2055
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,600
put in air fresheners put in scented

2056
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,360
candles

you won't see a scented candy you just

2058
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,199

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,440
that

2067
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,920
the regular diet does not cover the

2068
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,360
onslaught of poisons and chemicals and

2069
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,840

healthy liz they do they do it's it's

2074
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,000
incredible really

2075
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,679
so anyway so that's just some

2076
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,480
information today that look you guys

2077
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:35,199
lysine is something i take every day too

2078
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,560
there's a vegan epa i take right from

2079
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,360
vimergy it's the only one i trust i

2080
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,679
won't take one

2081
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,000
if they actually didn't have this i

2082
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,400
would never take an epa dha really

2083
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,159
anymore just none of them are up to snub

2084
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,920
to compare to this now

2085
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,080
and then the curcumin i take every

2086
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,520
single day as well so i take that one of

2087
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,520
emergency curcumin right

2088
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,840
so this is all the stuff i do and what

2089
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,960
do i do for dosages of curcumin

2090
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,040
every single day i'll take four capsules

2091
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,360
four capsules are curcumin every day

2092
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,920
that's what i do

2093
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,679
look don't like as i said before i gave

2094
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,000
you kind of a little disclaimer don't

2095
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:14,400
get overwhelmed at what i

2096
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,640
take i'm under immense pressure enormous

2097
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:20,960
enormous stress

2098
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:24,080
i'm putting out probably the the most

2099
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,719
comprehensive book i've ever put out

2100
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,000
in history in my history and in the

2101
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,560
history of natural medicine

2102
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,080
and conventional medicine too so you

2103
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,679

in the store right but i do a lot of tea

2127
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,320
like i said you guys

2128
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,840
showed you that so this is this is a big

2129
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,600
part of it i do

2130
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,600
like i said the heavy metal detox goes

2131
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,199
in here a lot of times

2132
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,719
you know but i also have the cilantro on

2133
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,040
the same day i have the dolson the same

2134
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,480
day

2135
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,880
and i have the in the wild blueberry

2136
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,960
shot so i'm getting that a lot if i

2137
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,239
can't make the smoothie one day

2138
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:41,120
there's that and the vitamin c

2139
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:42,159
i take a lot i'll sometimes i'll take 10

2140
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,880
capsules

2141
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:46,719
three times a day of the microc

2142
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,480
especially if i'm concerned about being

2143
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,640
exposed concerned about anything like

2144
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,440
that if i feel like i've pushed myself

2145
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,080
to a limit

2146
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,840
the less sleep i get by working harder

2147
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,480
say i'll only give myself three hours of

2148
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,080
sleep

2149
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,600
like last night i only gave myself three

2150
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,120
and a half hours of sleep right

2151
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,880
so my three and a half hours of sleep

2152
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,600
i'm like i better take more vitamin c so

2153
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,199
i took

2154
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,760
10 capsules of vitamin c is what i did

2155
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:13,120
the microc the best one there is that's

2156
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,199
the best seed there is anyway

2157
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,320
guys i'm heading off to ig i think we

2158
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:19,679
covered

2159
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:23,679
a good portion of what i take in a day

2160
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:27,040
and but we're going to be doing another

2161
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,520
live on immune system so maybe

2162
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,199
in like a couple days or something like

2163
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,960
that we'll do an immune system one then

2164
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,400
we're gonna do or a baseline one what's

2165
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,840
a good baseline because this is

2166
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,320
everything i take in a day

2167
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,360
but what's a good baseline for someone

2168
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,280
you know like

2169
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,960
what's the definite baseline for

2170
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,239
somebody and they can work from there

2171
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:49,280
so that'll probably be the next

2172
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:51,440
