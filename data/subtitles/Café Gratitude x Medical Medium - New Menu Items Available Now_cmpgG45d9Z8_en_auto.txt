[0.20 - 3.96] so true give me the uh load down on this
[2.48 - 5.32] on some of the masterful work that
[3.96 - 8.88] you've done with the medical medium
[5.32 - 10.56] dishes I know they're no oil no nuts
[8.88 - 13.68] which is incredible all on its own
[10.56 - 15.72] glutenfree soy free soy free and easy on
[13.68 - 18.16] the salt exactly so tell me a little bit
[15.72 - 20.36] about how like working with those
[18.16 - 21.76] parameters and everything well I mean it
[20.36 - 23.84] was like I said it was a great
[21.76 - 25.80] opportunity to look at cooking in a new
[23.84 - 28.24] way so it was and and to look for
[25.80 - 30.36] alternatives to the traditional flavor
[28.24 - 31.76] builders that we usually use in food um
[30.36 - 33.36] as you know part of the collaboration
[31.76 - 34.92] that we have here is that we assign
[33.36 - 36.52] affirmation names to all of our food
[34.92 - 39.40] which actually helps the healing process
[36.52 - 41.76] in our opinion um and mine too yeah
[39.40 - 44.20] right it is a good thing so here we have
[41.76 - 46.36] imys which is our green papaya and kelp
[44.20 - 48.12] noodle salad um with a coconut based
[46.36 - 51.16] dressing and lots of Thai spices and
[48.12 - 52.88] herbs here we've got the I Am Noble for
[51.16 - 54.60] the noble potato because it's the spicy
[52.88 - 56.80] potato burrito bowl with your cheese
[54.60 - 58.48] sauce and the potato is Noble for sure
[56.80 - 60.52] exactly and a healing food a lot of
[58.48 - 62.28] people don't know that so that's really
[60.52 - 63.44] powerful the name goes perfect with it
[62.28 - 64.92] right there and we've got a black bean
[63.44 - 66.68] picadillo that goes with that and then
[64.92 - 69.00] some water sauteed kale and some great
[66.68 - 70.40] Pico deallo W you got the kale that's
[69.00 - 72.40] incredible to got some greens in there
[70.40 - 75.28] to sort of lighten it up a bit and so
[72.40 - 78.16] this is I am trustworthy which is your
[75.28 - 80.12] uh original portabello and uh pepper
[78.16 - 82.60] fajita dish we've dressed it up with a
[80.12 - 84.72] little bit of lemon marinated red onions
[82.60 - 86.56] some guacamole and some P DEA with a
[84.72 - 88.48] squeeze of lime as well and we serve it
[86.56 - 89.60] with the Millet tortillas which are I
[88.48 - 91.92] think you're sort of famous for those
[89.60 - 94.60] right you can see it's the Perfect Blend
[91.92 - 97.16] and you got the Millet tortilla you can
[94.60 - 98.68] put a little bit of guacamole in there
[97.16 - 100.52] you can put a little bit of the onion in
[98.68 - 102.60] there you can make it the way you want
[100.52 - 104.12] it that's incredible and then it becomes
[102.60 - 105.96] like finger food then you have in your
[104.12 - 108.36] hands you can enjoy it then you can add
[105.96 - 110.28] a little bit more that's exciting I'm
[108.36 - 112.56] actually I can't wait that's the first
[110.28 - 114.12] thing I go to is that right there cuz I
[112.56 - 115.72] want those little tortillas in my hand
[114.12 - 118.88] and I want to put a little bit of that
[115.72 - 120.36] guacamole and you know your guacamole
[118.88 - 122.36] that's a whole different kind of
[120.36 - 124.48] guacamole and I know that because I've
[122.36 - 126.48] tried guacamole in different places and
[124.48 - 128.84] Cafe Gratitude guacamole is another
[126.48 - 130.44] level it actually has flavor and that's
[128.84 - 132.52] the key well in part of the affirmation
[130.44 - 134.04] healing you can trust that everything in
[132.52 - 135.44] this plate is going to be good for the
[134.04 - 136.20] body right so that's what we're calling
[135.44 - 137.96] it
[136.20 - 139.96] trustworthy and the last one that we're
[137.96 - 142.84] having as part of the menu here is the I
[139.96 - 145.28] am insightful which is a jasmine rice an
[142.84 - 147.68] organic jasmine rice vegetable Sushi we
[145.28 - 149.32] serve it with uh pumpkin seed tofu which
[147.68 - 151.24] is something that I think is a really
[149.32 - 154.48] great sort alternative another whole
[151.24 - 156.36] food avocado some vegetables carrots
[154.48 - 157.96] cabbage and also some cucumber in there
[156.36 - 161.20] as well you got the zinc and the Pumpkin
[157.96 - 163.16] Seed so there's just there's healing
[161.20 - 164.76] there's all kinds of different aspects
[163.16 - 166.40] of these dishes that are healing in oh I
[164.76 - 168.60] want to go to the papaya which is
[166.40 - 171.40] incredible you're not using the Hawaiian
[168.60 - 173.44] papaya no that is mindblowing right
[171.40 - 175.24] there because you know like just if
[173.44 - 177.16] somebody's going to use papaya it always
[175.24 - 179.64] seems to be the Hawaiian papaya and I'm
[177.16 - 182.96] like no this is incredible so you got
[179.64 - 185.60] the shredded papaya and that's IM Amy
[182.96 - 188.04] yes we we work with Organics pretty much
[185.60 - 190.12] exclusively and I believe under the
[188.04 - 192.52] organic certifications you can't have
[190.12 - 193.92] the genetically modified papaya so
[192.52 - 195.48] that's why we don't go with the Hawaiian
[193.92 - 197.32] one unfortunately but that's just the
[195.48 - 198.92] reality it's just the reality of it oh
[197.32 - 200.88] we forgot the precious the uh wild
[198.92 - 203.88] blueberry and cherry smoothie there it
[200.88 - 205.16] is right there an mm smoothie okay and
[203.88 - 206.88] that's the wild blueberry that's the
[205.16 - 209.84] Cherry people are going to love the
[206.88 - 212.36] flavor it's B orang juice oh it's so
[209.84 - 215.32] good and so so rich but yet so light
[212.36 - 218.36] you're satiated but you won't leave like
[215.32 - 220.32] we're feeling real heavy and greasy and
[218.36 - 222.96] all that it's absolutely not absolutely
[220.32 - 224.56] not just healing food people can fill up
[222.96 - 225.56] get satiated and then they can do
[224.56 - 227.04] whatever they need to do they're
[225.56 - 228.60] workouts they can go to the beach
[227.04 - 231.80] whatever they got to do live their life
[228.60 - 233.40] but they got the best food purest forms
[231.80 - 234.96] they don't have the uh the nuts and the
[233.40 - 236.60] oils and I'm not saying that like nuts
[234.96 - 239.88] are terrible or anything like that it's
[236.60 - 241.88] just that these are breaking those rules
[239.88 - 244.28] it's like the no oil the no soy the no
[241.88 - 246.28] gluten the no nuts and then the easy on
[244.28 - 248.04] the salt I mean it's mind-blowing well
[246.28 - 249.72] the more the more guidelines that we can
[248.04 - 251.52] follow here the the more people we can
[249.72 - 253.28] bring into this way of eating right so
[251.52 - 255.64] if somebody wants to eat healthier but
[253.28 - 256.92] can't eat nuts then half of the menu you
[255.64 - 258.40] know is not going to be available in
[256.92 - 259.92] this case they can have the whole thing
[258.40 - 262.76] there's no nothing that they don't have
[259.92 - 265.32] to uh not have you know I challenge
