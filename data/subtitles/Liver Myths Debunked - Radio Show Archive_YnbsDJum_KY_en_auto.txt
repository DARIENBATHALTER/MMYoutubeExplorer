[16.12 - 20.40] medium hello my name's Anthony William
[18.92 - 22.28] you're listening to the medical medium
[20.40 - 25.08] radio show where each week we talk about
[22.28 - 27.48] the most advanced healing information on
[25.08 - 29.28] health that's out there anywhere there's
[27.48 - 31.20] no other show no other book no other
[29.28 - 33.80] podcast no anything that has the
[31.20 - 35.20] information we offer it's well known at
[33.80 - 37.32] this point what we're doing at the
[35.20 - 39.20] medical medium series books and how this
[37.32 - 41.00] information is decades ahead of what's
[39.20 - 43.44] out there now if you're new to the show
[41.00 - 45.64] just giving you the 411 on that so you
[43.44 - 48.60] know we're going to we're talking today
[45.64 - 50.96] about liver myths liver myths so what's
[48.60 - 52.44] what's a li what's a liver myth
[50.96 - 55.08] basically what that means is things like
[52.44 - 56.48] liver flushing liver Stones we're going
[55.08 - 58.40] to talk all about that that's
[56.48 - 59.60] interesting right I think it is and it's
[58.40 - 61.68] important to know we're going to talk
[59.60 - 64.44] about eating liver how about that one
[61.68 - 66.36] what about Ox bile and you know this is
[64.44 - 68.16] out of the liver rescue book but just
[66.36 - 71.16] please know that this is a
[68.16 - 74.48] fraction of what's in Liver Rescue and
[71.16 - 77.52] it's literally a fraction like just a
[74.48 - 80.12] grain of rice to a silo of rice as far
[77.52 - 82.00] as what's in Liver Rescue and even in
[80.12 - 83.60] the section the chapter in Liver Rescue
[82.00 - 86.12] about myths and you know liver myths and
[83.60 - 88.04] so forth so um even with this this is
[86.12 - 89.92] just a couple of things compared to
[88.04 - 91.96] what's in there so just letting you know
[89.92 - 94.24] so you don't think oh I heard about that
[91.96 - 96.12] and oh whatever you just missed out then
[94.24 - 98.36] you missed out so go to the library take
[96.12 - 100.72] out the Liver Rescue book um go to
[98.36 - 103.32] amazon.com get it there too whatever you
[100.72 - 105.56] need to do the information in Liver
[103.32 - 107.40] Rescue is decades ahead ahead of what's
[105.56 - 110.72] out there now that's the whole point you
[107.40 - 112.40] know you need you need information that
[110.72 - 114.84] actually can take you someplace that
[112.40 - 117.20] actually can help you heal and it's
[114.84 - 118.88] really important that you you become
[117.20 - 120.48] that expert so you can take care of your
[118.88 - 122.24] loved ones and your health and your own
[120.48 - 123.92] health and I mean your loved On's Health
[122.24 - 127.00] your friends Health your family
[123.92 - 128.68] everybody co-workers it's it is really
[127.00 - 130.12] that important I see people struggling
[128.68 - 132.08] out there for many years I've helped
[130.12 - 134.32] thousands of people over the years
[132.08 - 136.80] celery juice the very thing we started
[134.32 - 138.48] uh medical medium uh the series started
[136.80 - 140.96] you know back a few years ago and even
[138.48 - 143.24] before that I started celery juice um
[140.96 - 145.24] getting it out there for people that's
[143.24 - 147.24] taking the World by storm helping people
[145.24 - 149.96] recover in so many ways and it's so
[147.24 - 151.60] helpful for the liver too and it's still
[149.96 - 153.96] the very little is known about celery
[151.60 - 155.76] juice except for here the source of
[153.96 - 157.52] where it started and we're going to talk
[155.76 - 159.12] about celery juice a little with this
[157.52 - 160.92] because when you're dealing with things
[159.12 - 163.24] like liver stones and you're doing liver
[160.92 - 165.80] flushes and you're you're trying to get
[163.24 - 167.84] your bile better by taking Ox bile
[165.80 - 170.00] really what you need is celery juice but
[167.84 - 171.12] we're going to go into the myths and
[170.00 - 172.44] we're going to take a look at this and
[171.12 - 175.76] see where we're starting let's start
[172.44 - 178.04] with eating liver okay so eating liver's
[175.76 - 179.76] been around for a while you guys know
[178.04 - 182.60] that you've heard of that right you have
[179.76 - 185.32] turkey turkey uh stuffing might have the
[182.60 - 186.64] turkey Liz turkey gizzards in there
[185.32 - 189.16] whatever you call them about to say
[186.64 - 191.64] lizards the tur turkey liver right
[189.16 - 195.96] chicken liver um that's something that
[191.64 - 197.60] you know people do eat cow liver um so
[195.96 - 200.12] liver is actually something that's
[197.60 - 203.08] that's been around people eat it they
[200.12 - 204.64] fry it in a pan they bake it in the oven
[203.08 - 207.36] they broil it or whatever and they do
[204.64 - 209.08] things with liver and the the reason
[207.36 - 210.84] people eat liver there's two reasons I
[209.08 - 212.96] always say one reason is they like the
[210.84 - 214.16] taste so that's one reason the other
[212.96 - 215.76] reason they think they're getting
[214.16 - 217.44] something they think they're getting
[215.76 - 219.68] something nutritious something yummy
[217.44 - 222.00] something good in them not just good
[219.68 - 224.16] yummy but something that's really
[222.00 - 226.88] fortified something that's get building
[224.16 - 229.00] their blood giving them iron building up
[226.88 - 230.56] their you know building up their blood
[229.00 - 232.08] building their hemoglobin building up
[230.56 - 233.72] their whole you know all kinds of
[232.08 - 235.20] different things but that's not how it
[233.72 - 236.96] works it's not how it works I'm going to
[235.20 - 238.64] go into this right now and this is just
[236.96 - 241.84] a fun one to start with before we get
[238.64 - 244.08] into Ox bile and liver flushes and liver
[241.84 - 246.20] Stones so you guys are going to have a
[244.08 - 247.80] good time I'm having a good time but
[246.20 - 249.92] it's really it's really this is like one
[247.80 - 252.52] of one of my favorite things to talk
[249.92 - 255.68] about because it just goes to show you
[252.52 - 258.64] how misinformation travels and becomes
[255.68 - 260.16] law or travels and becomes some kind of
[258.64 - 262.04] like popular Trend or something
[260.16 - 264.68] meanwhile is it really helping no it's
[262.04 - 266.52] not eating liver is really not a good
[264.68 - 269.08] thing it's highly toxic so you have to
[266.52 - 270.68] know how things work the the a liver in
[269.08 - 273.24] an animal
[270.68 - 275.36] is there to collect poison that's what a
[273.24 - 278.88] liver is doing it's there to collect
[275.36 - 281.40] poison bottom line our livers are
[278.88 - 284.76] collecting poison you wouldn't want to
[281.40 - 287.12] eat somebody else's liver fill the toxic
[284.76 - 289.48] heavy metals in there petrochemicals
[287.12 - 291.84] solvents Plastics
[289.48 - 294.48] Pharmaceuticals you you wouldn't want to
[291.84 - 296.88] eat another person's liver yeah of
[294.48 - 300.12] course you wouldn't want to duh right
[296.88 - 302.68] the whole bit but seriously though
[300.12 - 304.24] can you imagine can you imagine and you
[302.68 - 305.56] know what the same thing with the cow's
[304.24 - 307.20] liver there's still all kinds of
[305.56 - 309.44] pollutants all kinds of heavy metals all
[307.20 - 313.48] kinds of toxins Generations from the
[309.44 - 316.00] cow's life going back meaning before and
[313.48 - 317.64] and and and so forth and and how the
[316.00 - 320.36] cows were breed it doesn't matter if
[317.64 - 323.16] it's grass-fed the the livers fill the
[320.36 - 324.76] to poisons and toxins and and that
[323.16 - 326.56] happens all I mean that's just the way
[324.76 - 330.64] it is that's what the liver does
[326.56 - 333.80] naturally even if planet Earth was PR de
[330.64 - 337.48] with no mercury in the waterways and no
[333.80 - 341.40] dioxins everywhere even if it was dioxin
[337.48 - 343.56] free U Mercury free everything free you
[341.40 - 344.88] know what's funny you know what's really
[343.56 - 346.84] funny and this has nothing to do with me
[344.88 - 349.56] liking animal protein or not or whatever
[346.84 - 351.92] or not or liking veganism or not or
[349.56 - 354.28] liking plant-based or vegetarian or
[351.92 - 356.56] whatever it is it you know it's it's
[354.28 - 359.16] kind of funny we say you know grass-fed
[356.56 - 361.48] grass-fed free range pasture you know
[359.16 - 362.68] pasture ranged or whatever we just I'm
[361.48 - 364.44] probably not even saying that right
[362.68 - 367.40] right now you know what I mean we say
[364.44 - 371.68] like whether it's homegrown okay free
[367.40 - 374.48] range grass-fed however it works we say
[371.68 - 377.12] all that right but what about the other
[374.48 - 380.08] things too is it Mercury free is there
[377.12 - 382.28] traces of mercury how much dioxin is in
[380.08 - 384.80] is in there even some of the best parts
[382.28 - 388.52] of this country here you can have cows
[384.80 - 390.92] grazing in a field and build up dioxins
[388.52 - 393.04] heavy inside the liver and build up
[390.92 - 395.00] other things heavy inside the liver and
[393.04 - 396.36] that's how what you have to understand
[395.00 - 399.28] you know what I mean when somebody says
[396.36 - 400.76] hey is it is it is it is it free range
[399.28 - 403.56] is the whole bit well wait a minute is
[400.76 - 405.80] it free of mercury is it free of dioxins
[403.56 - 407.44] no one know no one would know who cares
[405.80 - 409.56] nobody cares about any of that when it
[407.44 - 411.36] comes down to livers when it comes down
[409.56 - 413.36] to livers it matters it's just same same
[411.36 - 415.32] thing with like with plant-based is it
[413.36 - 416.80] organic yeah because you don't want
[415.32 - 418.08] pesticides in there right you don't want
[416.80 - 419.48] that kind of thing in there right but
[418.08 - 421.00] still there's always dioxins and
[419.48 - 422.48] everything and all that it's just that
[421.00 - 424.92] with animal products that gets
[422.48 - 427.36] concentrated more but still it's going
[424.92 - 429.36] to be a dioxin inside a walnut without a
[427.36 - 431.00] doubt there's there's going to be there
[429.36 - 434.28] and no one's saying that like wait a
[431.00 - 436.24] minute is this dioxin free you know it's
[434.28 - 438.28] organic but wait a minute is it dioxin
[436.24 - 439.72] free okay so back to being you know and
[438.28 - 441.60] that has nothing to do whether I like
[439.72 - 443.08] animal products or I'm or I like
[441.60 - 445.44] plant-based or whatever I'm just telling
[443.08 - 447.84] you how kind of funny that is but the
[445.44 - 450.92] bottom line is with the liver it is
[447.84 - 454.20] filled with dioxins it is filled with
[450.92 - 456.52] dioxins it really is and animal livers
[454.20 - 458.76] are loaded with them it's the place
[456.52 - 461.04] where it's concentrated heavy duty
[458.76 - 464.44] really concentrated if you're eating
[461.04 - 468.16] liver you're getting a high dose a high
[464.44 - 471.16] dose of metals dioxins and other
[468.16 - 473.00] pollutants lots of other pollutants so
[471.16 - 475.32] you always have to remember that and
[473.00 - 477.36] depending on what you know if if is it
[475.32 - 480.16] really yeah it matters if it's grass-fed
[477.36 - 483.04] it matters if it's not grain fed it
[480.16 - 484.60] matters if it's not um if
[483.04 - 488.64] Pharmaceuticals weren't used on the
[484.60 - 490.60] animals that all matters it does because
[488.64 - 492.76] then the liver would be yes more
[490.60 - 495.76] polluted if you were to eat the liver
[492.76 - 499.32] but the liver is not a place to gain
[495.76 - 502.88] nutrition it's not a place to gain
[499.32 - 506.28] nutrients or gain speed or gain anything
[502.88 - 508.80] in health eating animal liver is
[506.28 - 510.64] definitely something that's not helpful
[508.80 - 512.68] whatsoever unless it's the only food
[510.64 - 514.96] source you have you live somewhere in
[512.68 - 518.44] the world and the only thing you can
[514.96 - 519.88] find is an animal liver to eat then yes
[518.44 - 522.44] okay you better believe it you should
[519.88 - 523.80] eat it 100% you should eat that animal
[522.44 - 526.44] liver
[523.80 - 527.92] 100% if it means survival if it means
[526.44 - 530.12] that's going to put food on your table
[527.92 - 531.64] for you and your family damn right you
[530.12 - 534.84] you better eat it and put it on the
[531.64 - 537.80] table and I support you a billion per.
[534.84 - 540.24] absolutely but if you have choices any
[537.80 - 542.52] kind of choice whatever it is if you're
[540.24 - 545.08] into animal products don't do the liver
[542.52 - 546.56] do something else in the Animal product
[545.08 - 549.12] that in the Animal product world that
[546.56 - 550.88] you like absolutely so it's just you
[549.12 - 552.00] know and really when it comes down to
[550.88 - 553.80] the plant-based people they're not going
[552.00 - 555.92] to be eating animal liver so unless
[553.80 - 559.20] they're not really plant-based but if
[555.92 - 560.72] they're really solely plant-based 100%
[559.20 - 561.76] And and that's what they're they're
[560.72 - 563.48] doing then they're not going to be
[561.76 - 565.04] eating livers they're not going to eat
[563.48 - 566.52] stuffing with chicken liver and it
[565.04 - 567.92] they're not going to eat stuffing with
[566.52 - 569.64] turkey liver so it's really I guess for
[567.92 - 571.80] the animal protein people
[569.64 - 574.88] just stay away from liver desiccated
[571.80 - 576.76] liver and supplements stay the heck away
[574.88 - 578.32] from desiccated liver and supplements
[576.76 - 579.40] whatever you do if there's supplements
[578.32 - 580.88] you're taking and you look at the
[579.40 - 583.44] ingredient list and you're like oh my
[580.88 - 587.00] God wait desiccated liver desiccated
[583.44 - 589.92] kidney desec no no no no no get rid of
[587.00 - 593.40] it get rid of it what what it really
[589.92 - 596.36] should say be really should say is
[593.40 - 598.36] desiccated dioxin you know infested
[596.36 - 600.16] liver okay inside the supplement or
[598.36 - 602.08] however you want to say it that's what
[600.16 - 604.00] it should be something around like that
[602.08 - 607.52] because in the end that's all it is so
[604.00 - 610.52] yeah so eating livers out bad idea all
[607.52 - 613.00] around and a terrible idea for your own
[610.52 - 616.36] liver and that's the other part you want
[613.00 - 618.28] to hurt your liver eat liver because
[616.36 - 620.04] then your liver is going to have to
[618.28 - 622.56] absorb everything that liver was trying
[620.04 - 625.12] to absorb to protect that creature so as
[622.56 - 627.08] that liver was protecting the cow or
[625.12 - 629.68] whatever it is the Lamb or what whatever
[627.08 - 632.68] it is or the duck hey that's right duck
[629.68 - 637.36] liver I forgot about that duck liver
[632.68 - 639.28] right so so when that duck liver I'm I'm
[637.36 - 642.16] pretty silly today apparently that duck
[639.28 - 644.64] liver is protecting that duck and that
[642.16 - 647.84] duck is you know swimming in whatever
[644.64 - 650.12] Lake whatever Pond you know eating
[647.84 - 652.52] whatever toxic algae eating getting
[650.12 - 654.92] exposed to whatever toxic anything
[652.52 - 657.88] environmentally environmental so that
[654.92 - 659.96] liver is soaking all that poison up and
[657.88 - 662.64] waterways are not clean clean I'm sorry
[659.96 - 665.16] all waterways are not clean all of them
[662.64 - 667.76] rivers in pristine country still is
[665.16 - 669.52] polluted you know the craziest thing
[667.76 - 671.48] about rivers you could be in the country
[669.52 - 674.40] in the mountains and you could have the
[671.48 - 676.52] stream rolling through and be like w it
[674.40 - 678.72] just looks so clean as pristine we're up
[676.52 - 682.28] here fresh air there's no nothing around
[678.72 - 685.16] for Miles meanwhile you know back 50
[682.28 - 687.88] years ago 50 years ago could be a shack
[685.16 - 690.64] right on the side of that River a shack
[687.88 - 693.00] that that was there from that 1940s
[690.64 - 695.12] 1950s and what they did in there was
[693.00 - 697.40] they had all kinds of just stuff going
[695.12 - 699.28] on and they were dealing with metals and
[697.40 - 700.60] some kind of manufacturing or some
[699.28 - 702.56] anything they were play they were
[700.60 - 704.88] playing around in that shck I mean you'd
[702.56 - 707.40] be surprised and it's just garbage and
[704.88 - 709.04] crap I've been I've been in the woods
[707.40 - 711.08] for most of my life in some of the most
[709.04 - 713.52] pristine areas over the years especially
[711.08 - 715.44] when I was younger and I've I've hiked
[713.52 - 718.12] up like pristine rivers and stuff like
[715.44 - 720.52] that and then seen like an Old Mill that
[718.12 - 723.68] was there that was there back 80 years
[720.52 - 727.20] ago that's still bleeding tons of poison
[723.68 - 729.20] into into the pristine so-called River
[727.20 - 731.44] anything like that I've seen little
[729.20 - 733.36] Shacks that that are on you know sides
[731.44 - 735.48] of little streams like tiny little
[733.36 - 738.48] streams and the Shacks like there's all
[735.48 - 740.64] this rusted garbage in car parts and
[738.48 - 742.48] mercury and thermometers and all this
[740.64 - 745.12] garbage all sitting there by this little
[742.48 - 747.56] stream but if you walked 2 miles down
[745.12 - 749.48] the stream 3 miles down the stream the
[747.56 - 751.24] stream would be like it's like pristine
[749.48 - 753.68] and it's coming out of the mountain it's
[751.24 - 755.64] like whatever yeah you just the bottom
[753.68 - 757.56] line is everything's polluted in the
[755.64 - 759.12] waterways even in the most you know
[757.56 - 761.64] benign sense or whatever the most
[759.12 - 764.16] minimal sense the serious sense so the
[761.64 - 766.56] bottom line is you know what happens is
[764.16 - 768.96] when you eat liver you're polluting your
[766.56 - 772.12] liver your liver has to do all the
[768.96 - 774.48] cleanup on that basically it's like hey
[772.12 - 776.60] you got a filter your filters your liver
[774.48 - 779.20] inside your body let's clog that filter
[776.60 - 780.96] up faster 10 years faster than it would
[779.20 - 783.72] clog up from whatever the heck you're
[780.96 - 785.08] doing wrong anyway how about that okay
[783.72 - 787.36] so that's what it's like when you're
[785.08 - 789.36] about to eat liver be like hey I'm about
[787.36 - 790.88] to speed up my liver getting clogged up
[789.36 - 794.40] right now let me have a piece of this
[790.88 - 796.32] liver this is good oh iron ooh hemog oh
[794.40 - 797.56] it's going to build up oh red blood oh
[796.32 - 799.96] this is going to be good this is going
[797.56 - 802.04] to get my anemia in a better place let
[799.96 - 804.40] me cut this little piece let me eat this
[802.04 - 807.64] right here let me just speed the hell up
[804.40 - 810.20] my liver dysfunction my stagnant sluggy
[807.64 - 812.72] sluggy sluggish fatty liver let's just
[810.20 - 815.48] move that forward into Super stagnant
[812.72 - 816.88] sluggish you know fatty liver fast
[815.48 - 819.04] instead of it happening by the time
[816.88 - 820.68] we're 40 and we get our hot flashes and
[819.04 - 822.92] then we think it's hormones cuz doctors
[820.68 - 824.28] have no idea it's just a liver problem
[822.92 - 826.16] instead of getting you know instead of
[824.28 - 827.60] the hot flashes and we gain weight and
[826.16 - 829.84] all that cuz our liver gets sluggish why
[827.60 - 831.56] don't we move that up quicker a 10 years
[829.84 - 834.80] before that by keep on eating pieces of
[831.56 - 836.48] liver that's how silly it is that's how
[834.80 - 838.16] silly I look I can go on for that
[836.48 - 839.80] forever with that one but we got better
[838.16 - 842.76] ones to talk talk about anyway we got
[839.80 - 845.36] bigger fish to fry we got bigger livers
[842.76 - 847.32] to fry how about that one we got bigger
[845.36 - 849.56] livers to fry that's actually really
[847.32 - 851.84] funny all right I got to stop cracking
[849.56 - 855.40] myself up you guys I think I'm a little
[851.84 - 857.04] little too little too giggly today lot
[855.40 - 860.00] of celery juice I
[857.04 - 863.56] drank okay so let's go back let's go to
[860.00 - 866.84] the next one let's talk about let's talk
[863.56 - 869.32] about uh Ox B since we're on eating
[866.84 - 872.12] things let's talk have you he about Ox
[869.32 - 875.36] bile are you taking Ox bile to what
[872.12 - 880.24] improve your B production or are you
[875.36 - 883.24] taking Ox bile to digest food better oh
[880.24 - 885.64] man this one this one look I'm not going
[883.24 - 889.00] to be able to cover the whole Ox bile
[885.64 - 890.76] myth or theory in this show so I'm going
[889.00 - 892.56] to cover a good hunk of it move on to
[890.76 - 894.64] liver Stones move on to liver flushing
[892.56 - 895.92] and so forth but I'm going to cover a
[894.64 - 898.88] piece of it if you want to hear the
[895.92 - 901.72] whole story about Ox B you got to get
[898.88 - 903.72] Liver Rescue you just got to get it and
[901.72 - 905.80] you know so I mean bottom line you just
[903.72 - 908.64] you just have to you have to just for
[905.80 - 911.36] that and believe me that book is massive
[908.64 - 912.88] I mean it's a huge huge book so you can
[911.36 - 916.20] I mean there's so much information in
[912.88 - 918.88] there um just this loan is worth the
[916.20 - 921.04] price of admission and if you can't buy
[918.88 - 923.12] a book cuz you don't have the money I
[921.04 - 924.80] understand um I know I know people to be
[923.12 - 926.44] like I I can't buy a book right now
[924.80 - 927.80] things are that bad I be like we go to
[926.44 - 928.88] the library and they like yeah you're
[927.80 - 930.64] right and they're at the library and
[928.88 - 932.00] they're taking out the book it's it's
[930.64 - 934.28] the best thing ever it's such a great
[932.00 - 936.76] service I love that service it's amazing
[934.28 - 939.72] means a lot to me actually so here's the
[936.76 - 942.76] deal dealing with Ox bile you're
[939.72 - 945.08] consuming something that's actually has
[942.76 - 947.48] undiscovered chemical compounds in it in
[945.08 - 949.04] science of research that are damaging
[947.48 - 952.04] see there's not enough science and
[949.04 - 954.84] research to oxb because there isn't
[952.04 - 958.28] going to be now if we were going to fund
[954.84 - 960.52] nasso we were going to fund space travel
[958.28 - 962.76] fun funded like giving it infinite
[960.52 - 964.84] funding you wouldn't believe where we
[962.76 - 967.96] would be right now no one's going to
[964.84 - 971.36] give oxp infinite funding in fact
[967.96 - 973.68] nothing really good in general gets
[971.36 - 976.12] infinite funing funding and even things
[973.68 - 978.84] that are bad like oxp don't get infinite
[976.12 - 981.52] funding so and it doesn't get indefinite
[978.84 - 984.48] funding so the whole the whole point of
[981.52 - 985.48] the matter is when it comes down to
[984.48 - 989.20] something like
[985.48 - 991.36] oxp is it's not good for us but what's
[989.20 - 993.16] what's not good force in it still isn't
[991.36 - 995.76] even really even discovered there's
[993.16 - 997.40] really nothing going on with Ox B I mean
[995.76 - 999.20] how much money has been dumped into the
[997.40 - 1000.68] research and the ramifications involved
[999.20 - 1003.04] in the body and everything else really
[1000.68 - 1004.64] nothing so when you think about it that
[1003.04 - 1006.96] alone's a little spooky but let me tell
[1004.64 - 1009.28] you why it's bad let me tell you the
[1006.96 - 1011.88] whole thing so when you're taking Ox
[1009.28 - 1015.36] pile what you're doing is you're trying
[1011.88 - 1017.00] to a it possibly improve or help your
[1015.36 - 1019.56] liver and maybe the production of its
[1017.00 - 1021.28] own bio Reserves and it's not going to
[1019.56 - 1023.32] happen it's not going to happen that's
[1021.28 - 1026.20] not even possible and I'll tell you why
[1023.32 - 1028.16] in a minute B you're trying to digest
[1026.20 - 1029.88] your fats better you're trying to
[1028.16 - 1033.04] actually you know disperse your fats
[1029.88 - 1036.52] better which it won't because it's only
[1033.04 - 1038.76] our bile that can do that it's only our
[1036.52 - 1041.24] bile when we eat food we eat food and
[1038.76 - 1042.88] it's identified by our body immediately
[1041.24 - 1044.28] for the food it is the food we've been
[1042.88 - 1045.72] eating for hundreds and hundreds and
[1044.28 - 1048.08] hundreds and hundreds of years and even
[1045.72 - 1049.52] go down thousands of years that's how it
[1048.08 - 1052.56] works
[1049.52 - 1054.68] and and it's our bile that disperses the
[1052.56 - 1058.48] fats I mean that's just a fraction of
[1054.68 - 1061.04] how it works so here's the deal first of
[1058.48 - 1063.08] all when you put Ox in you you're
[1061.04 - 1067.08] putting in what's kind of like a foreign
[1063.08 - 1069.64] foreign alien kind of um you alien
[1067.08 - 1073.00] substance inside the body so the liver
[1069.64 - 1075.80] sees it as alien too it the makeup is
[1073.00 - 1078.52] entirely different everything about Ox
[1075.80 - 1081.68] bile is entirely different than human
[1078.52 - 1082.92] bile and that's important to understand
[1081.68 - 1085.08] and you're not going to build up our
[1082.92 - 1087.44] strengthen your liver's bile reserves
[1085.08 - 1089.80] with Ox bile you're going to weaken it
[1087.44 - 1092.32] what happens is if you want to weaken a
[1089.80 - 1094.36] liver you throw in something to throw it
[1092.32 - 1096.72] you throw in something to confuse it you
[1094.36 - 1099.76] throw in something that completely
[1096.72 - 1101.60] throws it off in every way possible and
[1099.76 - 1103.08] that's not a good idea to begin with but
[1101.60 - 1105.36] I'm going to go into the more heavy duty
[1103.08 - 1107.68] reasons why it's just disastrous so
[1105.36 - 1109.40] first of all Ox B's chemical compounds
[1107.68 - 1111.84] and the structures inside are completely
[1109.40 - 1114.08] different like I said earlier than human
[1111.84 - 1116.12] B to begin with they're not going to
[1114.08 - 1118.00] spend millions and millions of dollars
[1116.12 - 1120.80] to to actually figure out what those
[1118.00 - 1122.92] chemical compounds are so that alone is
[1120.80 - 1125.92] actually dangerous to our liver and to
[1122.92 - 1127.72] our body to to a point it's not the
[1125.92 - 1131.40] worst thing in the world but it's not
[1127.72 - 1135.12] good at all chemical compounds can be
[1131.40 - 1137.36] life-altering in a bad way in a very bad
[1135.12 - 1139.40] way with our health and here's one of
[1137.36 - 1141.40] the reasons why it's not a good idea
[1139.40 - 1143.80] concentrations are not going to be
[1141.40 - 1145.92] appropriate no matter what an ox is a
[1143.80 - 1148.84] gigantic animal compared to a human
[1145.92 - 1150.48] being Ox bile the concentration of ox
[1148.84 - 1152.56] bile versus the concentration of what
[1150.48 - 1154.76] human bile is and those levels has
[1152.56 - 1158.88] hasn't even been tapped into isn't even
[1154.76 - 1160.96] understood so even if Ox bile was a good
[1158.88 - 1163.00] thing in some way the concentrations
[1160.96 - 1164.56] would be detrimentally off it would be a
[1163.00 - 1166.20] bad situation as far as the
[1164.56 - 1168.84] concentration levels you have to know
[1166.20 - 1171.84] that so if you're taking some
[1168.84 - 1173.48] idea of how much Ox B to take or some
[1171.84 - 1175.16] company some pharmaceutical company that
[1173.48 - 1177.20] wants to make money and benefit off of
[1175.16 - 1179.56] ox bile because it's a trend and you
[1177.20 - 1182.40] want to take that the dosage itself is
[1179.56 - 1184.20] not even going to even line up remotely
[1182.40 - 1186.12] to what would be there it wouldn't it
[1184.20 - 1188.72] would be impossible to know the dosage
[1186.12 - 1190.48] on that on any level whatsoever so
[1188.72 - 1192.92] that's something that's important to
[1190.48 - 1194.92] understand and how is that important a
[1192.92 - 1197.32] it's damaging to the liver it's a much
[1194.92 - 1199.12] more concentrated form and it's like an
[1197.32 - 1202.60] alien source to to the liver so it's a
[1199.12 - 1205.88] highly concentrated form of bile added
[1202.60 - 1209.60] alien form to the liver the liver has a
[1205.88 - 1211.36] right to produce bile it's a human right
[1209.60 - 1214.88] that the liver has it's a working
[1211.36 - 1217.48] chemical function of of almost 2,000 or
[1214.88 - 1219.80] over 2,000 chemical functions that the
[1217.48 - 1222.12] liver has science and research only know
[1219.80 - 1224.24] of about 500 chemical functions that the
[1222.12 - 1227.16] liver possesses and they don't really
[1224.24 - 1228.92] know a lot about those 500 very little
[1227.16 - 1231.20] at all if any
[1228.92 - 1234.92] and with the liver really truthfully
[1231.20 - 1236.88] having over 2,000 chemical functions how
[1234.92 - 1238.88] is it possible to understand what's
[1236.88 - 1241.24] going to happen when you pop in when you
[1238.88 - 1243.60] pop in that Ox pile one thing that you
[1241.24 - 1246.92] have to know is that the liver Has Its
[1243.60 - 1249.72] Right to manage its own bio regulation
[1246.92 - 1253.96] and it's all it cares about is managing
[1249.72 - 1255.88] its own bio regulation you take Ox bile
[1253.96 - 1257.88] it goes down into your gut down into
[1255.88 - 1259.44] your intestinal tract then it goes
[1257.88 - 1261.04] through through the walls of the
[1259.44 - 1263.24] intestinal tract because it starts to
[1261.04 - 1265.60] get assimilated it starts to get
[1263.24 - 1268.12] absorbed when it gets absorbed that
[1265.60 - 1270.84] absorption occurs it goes up the hepatic
[1268.12 - 1274.40] portal vein up the highway heading to
[1270.84 - 1276.36] the liver and it shocks the liver that's
[1274.40 - 1278.40] how it works it's the wrong
[1276.36 - 1280.36] concentrations because it's not a human
[1278.40 - 1282.40] concentration to begin with that's
[1280.36 - 1284.84] number one number two when it hits the
[1282.40 - 1286.80] liver it can shock it can put it into
[1284.84 - 1288.84] shock because the liver has never been
[1286.80 - 1290.52] up against something like that before
[1288.84 - 1292.96] it's it's it's almost equivalent to
[1290.52 - 1294.60] doing something like totally crazy like
[1292.96 - 1296.92] I mean I can't think anything off the
[1294.60 - 1299.00] top of my head right now but it's like
[1296.92 - 1301.24] it's like replacing a loved one with
[1299.00 - 1303.36] another loved one but yet it almost
[1301.24 - 1305.96] sounds the person almost sounds the same
[1303.36 - 1308.24] has the same name bile okay the whole
[1305.96 - 1310.60] bit think about it but it's not the same
[1308.24 - 1312.40] person but the person's bile that's the
[1310.60 - 1313.76] name of the person and it's almost like
[1312.40 - 1315.16] you're trying to get along with this
[1313.76 - 1317.00] person a whole bit it turns out wait a
[1315.16 - 1318.84] minute this isn't even this isn't even
[1317.00 - 1320.76] my family member or this isn't even my
[1318.84 - 1323.32] friend I mean that's not even a great
[1320.76 - 1324.96] way of even you know you know kind of
[1323.32 - 1326.76] laying this out but I'm just telling you
[1324.96 - 1329.44] that it's it's even far worse than even
[1326.76 - 1331.00] that okay so why why would it be so bad
[1329.44 - 1333.36] first of all when the liver has its own
[1331.00 - 1334.88] ability to produce human bile that's the
[1333.36 - 1338.28] whole point it's been doing it for a
[1334.88 - 1341.56] long time not in your lifetime hundreds
[1338.28 - 1344.52] of lifetimes it's been doing that very
[1341.56 - 1346.52] thing thousands of years it's human it's
[1344.52 - 1349.00] the human nature it's the liver's right
[1346.52 - 1351.04] to produce bile and regulated in the
[1349.00 - 1352.56] concentrations and dosage it needs to
[1351.04 - 1354.96] now here's the deal if your liver
[1352.56 - 1357.04] sluggish and stagnant if it's sluggish
[1354.96 - 1359.24] and stagnant and under producing its own
[1357.04 - 1361.64] bile or under producing the strength of
[1359.24 - 1364.68] its own bile because you have a stagnant
[1361.64 - 1366.72] sluggish liver or fatty liver or
[1364.68 - 1368.92] problematic liver because you've been
[1366.72 - 1370.84] eating diets way too high in fat you've
[1368.92 - 1373.36] been hurting your liver eating diets way
[1370.84 - 1374.96] too high in fat in the then the trend is
[1373.36 - 1376.44] high protein high fat right now how do
[1374.96 - 1378.76] you like that which is high protein is
[1376.44 - 1380.92] high fat that's the trend so we're here
[1378.76 - 1383.32] diminishing the trends or diminishing
[1380.92 - 1384.88] people's livers your liver will get
[1383.32 - 1386.68] diminished because of that get weakened
[1384.88 - 1389.12] get lose its strength and everything
[1386.68 - 1391.60] okay so that's what it does but if it's
[1389.12 - 1394.48] under producing its own bile out of
[1391.60 - 1397.64] being weak and sluggish do you think
[1394.48 - 1399.68] having Ox bile driven up the hepatic
[1397.64 - 1401.68] portal vein through the intestinal tract
[1399.68 - 1404.28] and up the hepatic portal vein into the
[1401.68 - 1406.56] liver would is going to then all of a
[1404.28 - 1410.48] sudden somehow prompt the liver to
[1406.56 - 1413.76] produce more human bile more human bile
[1410.48 - 1416.36] it's not possible it's not humanly
[1413.76 - 1419.48] possible it's not scientifically
[1416.36 - 1422.80] possible it's not anything possible all
[1419.48 - 1424.92] it is is just foreign garbage going up
[1422.80 - 1428.24] into the liver to the liver it's foreign
[1424.92 - 1431.68] garbage at concentration dosages and
[1428.24 - 1435.16] chemicals in it meaning chemicals
[1431.68 - 1438.32] undiscovered chemicals in there that the
[1435.16 - 1441.56] ox liver possesses that no human liver
[1438.32 - 1444.44] does is inside of this with information
[1441.56 - 1446.40] of an ox liver's information basically
[1444.44 - 1449.32] what it is it's a whole thing about the
[1446.40 - 1452.32] ox liver for generations and centuries
[1449.32 - 1454.52] of oxes and that's inside there so think
[1452.32 - 1456.12] about that so your liver is running on
[1454.52 - 1460.20] information that's thousands of years
[1456.12 - 1462.64] old for humans and human liver um um you
[1460.20 - 1464.40] know the human liver body communication
[1462.64 - 1465.88] and everything about it to sustain life
[1464.40 - 1468.36] to sustain you and it's sitting there
[1465.88 - 1470.60] running on that and it's designed in a
[1468.36 - 1472.12] way to take care of you in that way and
[1470.60 - 1473.72] everything else and designed in a way to
[1472.12 - 1475.44] produce its own bio in the way it needs
[1473.72 - 1478.68] to and everything else and you got this
[1475.44 - 1481.24] foreign bile driving up into the liver
[1478.68 - 1483.84] that's got its own information about an
[1481.24 - 1485.84] ox's life for generations and
[1483.84 - 1488.20] generations and thousands of years
[1485.84 - 1490.04] concentrations completely different
[1488.20 - 1491.80] chemical compounds in it completely
[1490.04 - 1493.48] undiscovered completely different the
[1491.80 - 1496.24] liver doesn't work like that it doesn't
[1493.48 - 1499.64] like to be pushed the liver doesn't like
[1496.24 - 1502.48] to be pushed into anything it not one of
[1499.64 - 1505.52] those organs that can handle being
[1502.48 - 1508.04] pushed that's how the liver works very
[1505.52 - 1510.60] important to understand and it doesn't
[1508.04 - 1512.96] like to be poisoned so it actually has
[1510.60 - 1515.84] to take that Ox bile and it actually has
[1512.96 - 1518.88] to store it away is poison it actually
[1515.84 - 1521.96] has to it has to put it into its poison
[1518.88 - 1524.36] Banks into its garbage Banks that's what
[1521.96 - 1527.36] happens it slows down the liver more
[1524.36 - 1530.20] weakens the liver more because bile is
[1527.36 - 1533.32] not supposed to do that where you're
[1530.20 - 1535.56] supposed to take this bile that was was
[1533.32 - 1538.20] was eliminated out of another animal's
[1535.56 - 1541.12] liver and then have it go backwards up
[1538.20 - 1545.32] into your own liver you can't do that
[1541.12 - 1549.88] the liver creates its own bile it
[1545.32 - 1553.36] creates it you see there isn't a bile
[1549.88 - 1558.52] duct coming from your intestinal tract
[1553.36 - 1560.96] to carry and deliver B up into the liver
[1558.52 - 1564.92] you know as if that's the way it works
[1560.96 - 1568.16] or something it doesn't work like that
[1564.92 - 1570.80] it just doesn't so there's no kind of
[1568.16 - 1572.64] boport in your in your gut that's
[1570.80 - 1575.68] sitting there connected to your liver to
[1572.64 - 1578.24] your ass okay and you're and you're and
[1575.68 - 1580.52] you're eating you're eating bile that
[1578.24 - 1583.36] comes from another animal's liver what
[1580.52 - 1586.08] in hopes that it goes up some magic kind
[1583.36 - 1588.32] of like bile duct Port right up into the
[1586.08 - 1590.76] liver it doesn't work like that
[1588.32 - 1594.12] the liver is drawing blood and nutrients
[1590.76 - 1596.84] yes up into the liver but it's not
[1594.12 - 1599.88] supposed to be drawing another foreign
[1596.84 - 1603.84] species another animal creatures bile up
[1599.88 - 1607.24] into the liver to to enhance or or
[1603.84 - 1610.28] create or you know or help the liver
[1607.24 - 1612.76] itself actually you know develop bile it
[1610.28 - 1615.20] doesn't work like that celery juice does
[1612.76 - 1617.36] though when celery juice actually shakes
[1615.20 - 1619.96] up the liver and helps it detox and
[1617.36 - 1622.72] cleans and rejuvenates the cells that
[1619.96 - 1624.72] produced bi that produced bile the
[1622.72 - 1628.08] chemical functions that that actually
[1624.72 - 1630.80] develop inside the liver to produce bile
[1628.08 - 1633.44] that's that's where it's done that is
[1630.80 - 1636.52] where it's done it's really important to
[1633.44 - 1639.04] know that's how it's done not throwing
[1636.52 - 1641.72] something in there and it all falls into
[1639.04 - 1643.92] that whole thing of thousands of years
[1641.72 - 1646.60] not even thousands of years ago you know
[1643.92 - 1647.92] even recent when you eat something like
[1646.60 - 1649.64] to F you think you're going to eat
[1647.92 - 1651.56] something to fix something that that
[1649.64 - 1653.04] whole stupid thing I'm going to eat I'm
[1651.56 - 1654.24] going to eat kidneys to get my kidney
[1653.04 - 1655.92] better I'm going to make sure I eat
[1654.24 - 1657.32] kidneys it's good for my kidney I'm
[1655.92 - 1659.40] going to eat liver to make my liver
[1657.32 - 1660.96] better I'm going to I'm going to eat Ox
[1659.40 - 1662.48] bile to make you know to make my liver
[1660.96 - 1664.40] better to actually get Ox I'm going to
[1662.48 - 1667.32] get I'm going to eat Ox bile to make my
[1664.40 - 1670.08] bile better if that's not the the
[1667.32 - 1671.64] silliest thing ever it was a theory
[1670.08 - 1674.24] hundreds of years ago in medieval
[1671.64 - 1675.60] medicine medieval medicine okay and in
[1674.24 - 1677.52] chronic illness we're still slightly
[1675.60 - 1678.80] medieval by the way in chronic illness
[1677.52 - 1681.32] not in other parts of medicine other
[1678.80 - 1684.00] parts of medicine we doing amazing but
[1681.32 - 1686.12] in in the medieval days okay centuries
[1684.00 - 1689.92] ago I'm telling you right now it was a
[1686.12 - 1692.52] big practice you eat a part of a body of
[1689.92 - 1695.40] an animal body to fix your part that's
[1692.52 - 1697.76] wrong that was the the consensus because
[1695.40 - 1699.84] it was an amazing Theory think about it
[1697.76 - 1701.80] if you got an eye trouble eye problem
[1699.84 - 1704.88] you eat eyeballs you eat eye that's what
[1701.80 - 1708.08] they did but it still carries on today
[1704.88 - 1709.52] it still carries on today that's why all
[1708.08 - 1712.08] these supplements still have like
[1709.52 - 1713.60] desiccated brain oh if you need if you
[1712.08 - 1715.88] got brain problems you should be eating
[1713.60 - 1718.76] brain if that's not the stupidest thing
[1715.88 - 1721.96] I've ever heard if that if that makes
[1718.76 - 1723.96] sense to someone they have to learn and
[1721.96 - 1725.28] get educated on how the Body Works to
[1723.96 - 1727.84] the best they could build it because if
[1725.28 - 1729.68] that makes sense it's unbelievable
[1727.84 - 1731.00] because and you know what you know what
[1729.68 - 1732.48] I'm you know what I'm completely wrong
[1731.00 - 1734.48] about something because it seems like it
[1732.48 - 1736.00] could make sense sure if I got a brain
[1734.48 - 1737.52] problem I should just eat brain that
[1736.00 - 1739.84] could fix it and you know what that kind
[1737.52 - 1741.68] of does make sense it kind of does so
[1739.84 - 1745.00] I'm sorry I even said that it kind of
[1741.68 - 1748.52] makes sense but it but but but it's that
[1745.00 - 1749.92] bad it's that bad if I have you know and
[1748.52 - 1752.40] that's the whole thing that's why it's
[1749.92 - 1754.40] like desiccated spleen desiccated liver
[1752.40 - 1756.12] any supplements desicated brain
[1754.40 - 1758.16] desiccated kidney whatever and it's in
[1756.12 - 1760.60] there oh desicated adrenal desicated
[1758.16 - 1763.16] whatever oh my God it doesn't work like
[1760.60 - 1764.72] this it just doesn't and the thing is if
[1763.16 - 1766.68] you're confused about thyroids and how
[1764.72 - 1768.32] thyroids work you should read thyroid
[1766.68 - 1770.08] healing my book thyroid healing the
[1768.32 - 1772.20] medical medium thyroid healing and I
[1770.08 - 1774.56] explained why thyroid medicine was the
[1772.20 - 1776.64] only thing out of all the ages that ever
[1774.56 - 1778.48] did anything the reason mean thyroid
[1776.64 - 1781.64] medicine meanwhile desiccated thyroid
[1778.48 - 1783.60] the only reason why is because it's it's
[1781.64 - 1785.40] a steroid that's why it's an actual
[1783.60 - 1786.92] steroid there's steroid compounds in
[1785.40 - 1789.84] there so that's one of the reasons it
[1786.92 - 1791.40] has a steroid effect and but but but
[1789.84 - 1793.32] eating liver and eating brain has no
[1791.40 - 1795.36] steroid effect nothing else it was only
[1793.32 - 1797.72] the thyroid that some people would
[1795.36 - 1800.16] subside some some some symptoms because
[1797.72 - 1801.88] it's steroidal that's the whole reason
[1800.16 - 1804.40] why medicine gives steroids out for
[1801.88 - 1806.92] every single thing that goes wrong any
[1804.40 - 1808.40] kind of inflammation so when you have
[1806.92 - 1810.24] when you have hashimotos
[1808.40 - 1812.88] thyroiditis it's
[1810.24 - 1814.32] inflamed and and steroids is what they
[1812.88 - 1815.96] use they use both different kinds of
[1814.32 - 1818.68] steroids and then they'll use desiccated
[1815.96 - 1820.64] thyroid which is a steroid I I've talked
[1818.68 - 1822.88] to tons and tons and tons of doctors
[1820.64 - 1824.32] over this a doctor friends talk to all
[1822.88 - 1826.20] different kinds of people that are in
[1824.32 - 1827.52] the best field of medicine in this and
[1826.20 - 1829.20] they'll say this they'll say you're
[1827.52 - 1831.52] right no it's a steroid it's steroid
[1829.20 - 1833.36] compound that's what it is and when you
[1831.52 - 1835.40] use steroids for anything you can
[1833.36 - 1837.08] actually get some relief because it CS
[1835.40 - 1838.80] down inflammation that's what it does
[1837.08 - 1841.00] that's what steroids do but that's the
[1838.80 - 1844.08] only exception to the rule that's ever
[1841.00 - 1846.20] happened ever happened over the years
[1844.08 - 1848.20] was the only exception to the rule was
[1846.20 - 1850.20] the steroid compound there other than
[1848.20 - 1852.52] that for every other exception it
[1850.20 - 1854.92] doesn't exist it just doesn't you eat
[1852.52 - 1858.08] you eat another animal a part to it I
[1854.92 - 1861.60] mean it doesn't fix your aing part heart
[1858.08 - 1864.80] it just can't that's how it works and
[1861.60 - 1867.24] and with Ox bile it's it's not it's it
[1864.80 - 1869.60] sure if you were to eat some brain maybe
[1867.24 - 1871.52] it wouldn't be bad maybe it wouldn't be
[1869.60 - 1873.00] bad if you ate some brain unless there
[1871.52 - 1873.88] was you know mad cow's disease or
[1873.00 - 1877.48] something you don't want to eat the
[1873.88 - 1879.76] brain of a Mad Cow the point is the the
[1877.48 - 1881.80] whole point though it's if it if it's
[1879.76 - 1884.32] actually you know wasn't in that kind of
[1881.80 - 1887.04] disease State then yeah I mean would it
[1884.32 - 1888.48] be that bad probably not same thing is
[1887.04 - 1890.80] if if you're eating it would kidney be
[1888.48 - 1892.52] that bad probably not liver is actually
[1890.80 - 1895.48] bad cuz it's the most toxic organ in the
[1892.52 - 1898.16] body so that's actually bad but the
[1895.48 - 1901.08] bottom line with Ox B though it's really
[1898.16 - 1904.04] bad because it's like Alchemy you
[1901.08 - 1906.96] shouldn't play with that's what it is
[1904.04 - 1909.24] because an ox and an ox liver is so
[1906.96 - 1913.04] different and everything about it it's
[1909.24 - 1916.92] got chemical functions that even surpass
[1913.04 - 1919.64] the human liver in a sense too many that
[1916.92 - 1920.96] live liver could not even figure out
[1919.64 - 1924.80] what to do with that
[1920.96 - 1927.64] information if anything it can confuse
[1924.80 - 1929.80] completely harm the liver I'm just being
[1927.64 - 1933.40] straight up and how it works so we got
[1929.80 - 1937.20] to be careful and the fats that humans
[1933.40 - 1939.20] eat are not what oxes eat whole whole
[1937.20 - 1942.40] another thing too so it's a whole
[1939.20 - 1944.80] another thing too so Ox bile is geared
[1942.40 - 1946.56] for something else and that's that you
[1944.80 - 1949.52] can go on and on and on I mean honestly
[1946.56 - 1953.56] I can and I can spend forever with the
[1949.52 - 1954.92] ox bile because it's it's that you want
[1953.56 - 1956.48] to get your liver better you know when
[1954.92 - 1957.88] you're bile is having trouble producing
[1956.48 - 1960.16] its own bile what it really needs
[1957.88 - 1961.92] instead of ox bile is a glass of celery
[1960.16 - 1964.44] juice is what it really needs to help
[1961.92 - 1967.48] heal and restore itself and that's
[1964.44 - 1970.60] that's a big deal that seriously you
[1967.48 - 1972.32] know um the bottom line is it's when you
[1970.60 - 1974.52] take it one day at a time with your
[1972.32 - 1976.40] health and you really get the right
[1974.52 - 1977.80] information and the right direction you
[1976.40 - 1979.76] could do something about things you
[1977.80 - 1982.72] could get your bile strength back up you
[1979.76 - 1985.28] can get your body in a place where wow
[1982.72 - 1987.36] you can get things to work again if you
[1985.28 - 1990.72] get the right information and celery
[1987.36 - 1993.24] juice over Ox bile trumps it kills it
[1990.72 - 1995.12] it's a billion times better than it it
[1993.24 - 1997.00] makes that much of a difference so the
[1995.12 - 1998.96] last thing you want to do is push your
[1997.00 - 2001.00] liver over the edge and that's what Ox
[1998.96 - 2002.68] can do it can push the liver it's
[2001.00 - 2004.64] already toxic already sluggish already
[2002.68 - 2007.24] stagnant already problematic possibly
[2004.64 - 2008.88] already fatty and fill the toxins filled
[2007.24 - 2010.08] with all kinds of other levels of toxins
[2008.88 - 2012.28] and everything else and you could push
[2010.08 - 2014.16] it over the edge and that's not a good
[2012.28 - 2016.12] thing Ox bile contains chemical
[2014.16 - 2020.20] compounds responsible for chemical
[2016.12 - 2023.00] functions that do not occur in your body
[2020.20 - 2025.72] in human bodies it also contains
[2023.00 - 2029.00] undiscovered amino acids that have no
[2025.72 - 2031.96] role at all inside the human body amino
[2029.00 - 2035.76] acids that are not supposed to be in a
[2031.96 - 2038.52] human body it's different than ox meat
[2035.76 - 2040.40] Ox bile is is different than ox meat
[2038.52 - 2042.00] it's different than red meat it's
[2040.40 - 2043.96] different than an animal meat or
[2042.00 - 2047.00] whatever that's entirely different the
[2043.96 - 2048.80] the amino acids inside the bile itself
[2047.00 - 2050.24] literally that are not monitored un that
[2048.80 - 2052.68] are undiscovered that are not being
[2050.24 - 2054.96] looked at carefully have no place in the
[2052.68 - 2056.80] human body and can I tell you something
[2054.96 - 2058.96] playing around with amino acids can be
[2056.80 - 2060.80] actually dangerous playing around with
[2058.96 - 2064.76] amino acids can be problematic and
[2060.80 - 2067.56] dangerous and even even I've seen people
[2064.76 - 2069.84] even do amino acid therapies and get so
[2067.56 - 2072.20] sick and that's amino acids that
[2069.84 - 2074.12] actually do have a role in the human
[2072.20 - 2076.28] body the body is very sensitive you got
[2074.12 - 2077.80] to be very careful with amino acids and
[2076.28 - 2079.92] that's something to really think about
[2077.80 - 2081.84] that alone when you consume the Oxo
[2079.92 - 2084.00] filled with all these extras all these
[2081.84 - 2086.36] extras I'm talking about just now that
[2084.00 - 2087.36] your body can't even use amino acids and
[2086.36 - 2089.52] everything else that are completely
[2087.36 - 2091.88] undiscovered chemical function compounds
[2089.52 - 2093.96] all that the extras go down from your
[2091.88 - 2095.36] stomach they pass the dadum they absorb
[2093.96 - 2097.04] right into the intestinal tract head
[2095.36 - 2099.08] directly like I said before into to the
[2097.04 - 2101.28] bloodstream the highway up to the liver
[2099.08 - 2103.96] meaning that your liver must process
[2101.28 - 2107.88] this Blood filled with foreign
[2103.96 - 2111.84] oxb so that's why it's not good all on
[2107.88 - 2114.56] its own and all for a theory and all for
[2111.84 - 2116.00] a theory so look I can go on and on and
[2114.56 - 2119.56] on with that one but I want to talk
[2116.00 - 2121.84] about even a more fun one which is liver
[2119.56 - 2123.68] Stones because I think that would be
[2121.84 - 2126.84] actually that would actually be a good
[2123.68 - 2128.04] one we'll do uh we'll do liver Stones I
[2126.84 - 2130.04] I think that's a great one so let's go
[2128.04 - 2132.52] right into that so have you heard about
[2130.04 - 2134.28] liver stones have you heard about that
[2132.52 - 2135.60] you got these great Brainiac guys out
[2134.28 - 2137.76] there now that are that are out there
[2135.60 - 2139.44] selling uh selling you know all kinds of
[2137.76 - 2141.92] cleanses and everything else and it's
[2139.44 - 2143.36] almost like you you get involved and you
[2141.92 - 2144.72] know what I mean and you you have to buy
[2143.36 - 2146.68] all these supplements and all these
[2144.72 - 2148.96] herbs and all this stuff and you know
[2146.68 - 2151.12] you have to rack up the money and just
[2148.96 - 2152.84] you know and just do your detox do your
[2151.12 - 2154.32] detox and what you're doing is you're
[2152.84 - 2155.76] you're trying to flush the liver and
[2154.32 - 2156.80] you're trying to get liver stones out
[2155.76 - 2158.20] and all that I don't know if you guys
[2156.80 - 2160.24] has experienced that yet you got to be
[2158.20 - 2161.64] careful with that stuff because that's
[2160.24 - 2163.00] not how you heal the liver that's not
[2161.64 - 2164.44] how you do anything for the liver and
[2163.00 - 2166.08] that's not how you get better it's
[2164.44 - 2168.08] important to know that there's so
[2166.08 - 2170.16] there's so many things you can do that
[2168.08 - 2172.12] are so much better and in Liver Rescue I
[2170.16 - 2174.00] actually lay it out I lay it out in
[2172.12 - 2176.00] there all the things you can do to
[2174.00 - 2178.00] protect yourself and do things that
[2176.00 - 2179.20] actually do work and heal and so forth
[2178.00 - 2181.32] when it comes down to liver and
[2179.20 - 2184.60] everything else let's talk about liver
[2181.32 - 2186.32] Stones okay so flushing liver stones and
[2184.60 - 2188.08] seeing all these liver stones in the
[2186.32 - 2189.40] toilet and everything else I'm not
[2188.08 - 2191.36] talking about gall stones and I'm going
[2189.40 - 2193.28] to talk about that too in a little bit
[2191.36 - 2195.68] but but we're talking liver Stones first
[2193.28 - 2196.88] of all if you got somebody that's saying
[2195.68 - 2200.36] there's liver
[2196.88 - 2203.40] Stones then then you you you need to run
[2200.36 - 2206.76] you need to run because there are no
[2203.40 - 2210.48] liver Stones the liver doesn't produce a
[2206.76 - 2212.76] stone it doesn't that's not how it works
[2210.48 - 2214.88] so the liver isn't there isn't a bunch
[2212.76 - 2217.12] of stone sitting inside in this in in
[2214.88 - 2218.32] the middle of your liver so the if
[2217.12 - 2219.68] because that's what happens people
[2218.32 - 2221.76] imagine this all the time and they get
[2219.68 - 2224.08] totally confused this is one of those
[2221.76 - 2226.16] myths and theories that are just beyond
[2224.08 - 2229.12] me really I honestly when I talk about
[2226.16 - 2231.72] this one the ox bile one isn't so bad
[2229.12 - 2234.88] this the the the Ridiculousness of the
[2231.72 - 2236.68] the ox bile one it's almost like not
[2234.88 - 2238.84] that bad even though it's terrible it's
[2236.68 - 2241.72] it's just it's it's still that's how bad
[2238.84 - 2243.52] this one is so how does it work with
[2241.72 - 2245.72] liver stones in the whole bit well
[2243.52 - 2247.68] practitioners and and and healers or
[2245.72 - 2249.64] whatever and gurus out there with
[2247.68 - 2252.24] cleanses and everything else and not
[2249.64 - 2254.28] everybody but they they all they think
[2252.24 - 2256.48] that the liver produces a
[2254.28 - 2258.76] stone and so you need the flesh that
[2256.48 - 2261.40] liver flesh the stones out it's not
[2258.76 - 2264.16] possible liver doesn't produce a stone
[2261.40 - 2267.36] it doesn't work like that the liver
[2264.16 - 2271.20] can't produce a stone it can't the
[2267.36 - 2272.84] liver's too hot to produce a stone one
[2271.20 - 2274.52] of the most advanced pieces of
[2272.84 - 2276.92] information you'll ever probably read
[2274.52 - 2278.24] well maybe not ever in liver rescue
[2276.92 - 2280.92] there's so many Advanced pieces of
[2278.24 - 2283.24] information but one that's actually is
[2280.92 - 2286.12] up there is up there with with with so
[2283.24 - 2289.12] many that are in Liver Rescue and which
[2286.12 - 2291.56] is incredible is that the heat of the
[2289.12 - 2293.52] liver actually can't create the stone
[2291.56 - 2296.36] anyway there's no Stones anyway inside
[2293.52 - 2297.68] the liver I mean I've talked to surgeons
[2296.36 - 2300.24] I've talked to surgeons there's no
[2297.68 - 2302.08] Stones inside the liver I've talked to
[2300.24 - 2303.96] surgeons there's stones in the
[2302.08 - 2305.92] gallbladder yeah there's stones in the
[2303.96 - 2308.68] gallbladder without a doubt you know
[2305.92 - 2312.12] made out of strong Billy Ruben there
[2308.68 - 2314.56] is but that's not they don't get into
[2312.12 - 2317.08] the gallbladder because they went up a
[2314.56 - 2318.92] duct from the liver so they don't go
[2317.08 - 2320.28] into the gallbladder because they went
[2318.92 - 2322.92] up the duct from the liver into the
[2320.28 - 2326.72] gallbladder that's not how it works if
[2322.92 - 2330.36] that's the case there would be thousands
[2326.72 - 2333.32] upon thousands and even more so than
[2330.36 - 2335.36] gallbladder surgeries there'd be
[2333.32 - 2338.16] emergency liver
[2335.36 - 2340.20] surgeries um there would be thousands I
[2338.16 - 2342.32] talked to a surgeon that told me there
[2340.20 - 2345.08] would be so many would be ridiculous it
[2342.32 - 2347.24] would be like it would be like aidomes
[2345.08 - 2348.96] it would be like that t
[2347.24 - 2351.40] tonsillectomies it would be like it
[2348.96 - 2354.00] would it would it would rise above
[2351.40 - 2356.12] override tonsillectomies ectomies and
[2354.00 - 2358.52] and and other things like that it would
[2356.12 - 2362.00] override it would it' be in a class all
[2358.52 - 2363.96] on its own the reason why cuz everybody
[2362.00 - 2365.64] has stones in the gallbladder because of
[2363.96 - 2367.76] their dirty livers and and and what
[2365.64 - 2369.28] they're eating and their high fat diets
[2367.76 - 2371.20] and they high protein high fat diets
[2369.28 - 2372.80] they all have they all have Stones even
[2371.20 - 2373.92] if they're small even if they're Sandy
[2372.80 - 2377.40] even if they're large they all have
[2373.92 - 2379.52] stones in there and what happens is the
[2377.40 - 2381.60] stones develop in the gallbladder
[2379.52 - 2383.88] there's no such thing as a liver Stone
[2381.60 - 2384.96] in the liver and this isn't because I
[2383.88 - 2387.52] talked to
[2384.96 - 2389.04] surgeons I already know this information
[2387.52 - 2391.40] and think I wrote that's why I wrote a
[2389.04 - 2392.96] whole thing on it it's not the the whole
[2391.40 - 2395.88] thing in here and live a
[2392.96 - 2399.12] rescue you can't have a stone go up the
[2395.88 - 2401.08] duck to the gallbladder man I know that
[2399.12 - 2402.40] because what happens is it'll get
[2401.08 - 2404.40] clogged right down at the base of the
[2402.40 - 2407.88] duck down there I mean people would be
[2404.40 - 2409.72] opened up every day because it because
[2407.88 - 2412.44] unlike the gallbladder which the stones
[2409.72 - 2414.76] sitting there forever they only they
[2412.44 - 2416.84] only get jammed up and the duct leaving
[2414.76 - 2418.16] the gallbladder once in a while I mean
[2416.84 - 2420.52] there's people out there dealing with it
[2418.16 - 2422.84] a lot but it's nothing because they
[2420.52 - 2425.24] usually just sit inside people's Gall
[2422.84 - 2427.84] the gall sack just sitting in there you
[2425.24 - 2430.04] know you know growing over time but a
[2427.84 - 2432.60] stone can't sit in the liver over time
[2430.04 - 2434.28] and pop up to that duct as if it's
[2432.60 - 2437.04] sending up going up the bile duct into
[2434.28 - 2439.40] the gallbladder I mean like I and like I
[2437.04 - 2441.28] said there would be so many surgeries it
[2439.40 - 2443.44] would be such one of the most first of
[2441.28 - 2446.28] all it' be a really hard
[2443.44 - 2449.52] surgery really really hard one really
[2446.28 - 2451.20] awful really awful I mean you have to go
[2449.52 - 2453.16] deep in there that would be a terrible
[2451.20 - 2456.08] surgery if that was happening all the
[2453.16 - 2458.48] time that would be an awful one so what
[2456.08 - 2459.84] happen happens is the liver's too hot
[2458.48 - 2461.32] and research and science doesn't know
[2459.84 - 2463.88] this part they don't know they don't
[2461.32 - 2464.56] know this the liver is too hot to forge
[2463.88 - 2469.72] a
[2464.56 - 2473.00] stone it's too hot it basically keeps it
[2469.72 - 2475.56] keeps the substances that form stones in
[2473.00 - 2478.32] a liquefied state due to the heat of the
[2475.56 - 2481.12] liver that's how it works but the
[2478.32 - 2484.80] gallbladder is cooler it's cooler than
[2481.12 - 2487.68] the liver is what it is it sits and
[2484.80 - 2489.16] perched in a spot on top of that that's
[2487.68 - 2492.56] cooler than the
[2489.16 - 2496.56] liver that that degree of
[2492.56 - 2498.28] coolness that the gallbladder has and
[2496.56 - 2501.16] versus the Heat of the
[2498.28 - 2504.36] liver okay makes a difference to a
[2501.16 - 2507.36] forged Stone to forging a stone when the
[2504.36 - 2509.08] liquid Gunk comes out of the liver from
[2507.36 - 2510.28] toxic livers from overburdened livers
[2509.08 - 2512.44] from livers filled with all kinds of
[2510.28 - 2514.48] poisons and toxins Pharmaceuticals
[2512.44 - 2516.40] petrochemicals heavy metals everything
[2514.48 - 2517.76] else Under the Sun and and then sitting
[2516.40 - 2519.24] there eating the high fat diets whether
[2517.76 - 2521.36] you're animal protein high fat or your
[2519.24 - 2523.36] vegan high fat that's there's there's no
[2521.36 - 2525.52] difference in there there's not really a
[2523.36 - 2527.08] difference in there like plant-based
[2525.52 - 2529.96] people I've seen them like just chug the
[2527.08 - 2532.44] nut Butters and cashew Butters and my
[2529.96 - 2534.36] God tahen and everything and lots and
[2532.44 - 2535.44] lots of lots and lots of avocado and
[2534.36 - 2536.84] then they're told that this is the way
[2535.44 - 2538.24] to go and then they get themselves sick
[2536.84 - 2540.84] and think they need to go back to animal
[2538.24 - 2543.00] protein diet then they go back to animal
[2540.84 - 2545.80] protein where they got sick to begin
[2543.00 - 2547.72] with because nobody starts out vegan
[2545.80 - 2549.36] like you know what I mean so they they
[2547.72 - 2550.80] go to vegan they're like who my God and
[2549.36 - 2553.36] they're but they're eating all the high
[2550.80 - 2554.48] fat that way too and they they then they
[2553.36 - 2557.12] get themselves sick and then they're
[2554.48 - 2558.64] running back to animal protein and the
[2557.12 - 2560.12] animal protein people they're eating all
[2558.64 - 2561.52] the high fat diet now plus they're
[2560.12 - 2562.96] Switching gears they're eating less
[2561.52 - 2564.68] animal protein now I don't know if you
[2562.96 - 2566.76] know this but if you're animal protein
[2564.68 - 2568.20] person you have you seen that yet animal
[2566.76 - 2570.88] protein people are eating less animal
[2568.20 - 2572.36] protein why is that I wonder why that's
[2570.88 - 2574.84] happening isn't that funny because
[2572.36 - 2576.48] eating too much animal protein is bad it
[2574.84 - 2578.20] is too much is bad I'm just just saying
[2576.48 - 2580.80] I'm not against animal protein it's too
[2578.20 - 2583.04] bad it's bad eating too many nuts seeds
[2580.80 - 2585.64] avocados is bad too for the plant-based
[2583.04 - 2587.24] people it's bad I'm sorry but it is I
[2585.64 - 2589.60] know I get the I know I get the vegans
[2587.24 - 2592.12] upset I know that I know I get the Paleo
[2589.60 - 2594.12] people upset but I don't care because
[2592.12 - 2596.44] it's about you it's about you having an
[2594.12 - 2598.00] answer so you can protect yourself and I
[2596.44 - 2599.28] always say you're worth that you're
[2598.00 - 2600.92] worth getting the right answers to
[2599.28 - 2603.60] protect yourself it's worth protecting
[2600.92 - 2605.36] you I mean that's what I'm doing on here
[2603.60 - 2607.16] I think it's worth it it's why I'm here
[2605.36 - 2610.12] I'm here yelling talking about this all
[2607.16 - 2612.00] the time so the deal is when the liver's
[2610.12 - 2614.60] burdened with all that high fat going up
[2612.00 - 2616.60] the hepatic portal vein and all the bile
[2614.60 - 2618.24] that needs to disperse the fat and wears
[2616.60 - 2621.72] its bile Reserve out of the liver and
[2618.24 - 2623.48] everything else it overheats and all
[2621.72 - 2626.24] that junk and all that poison and old
[2623.48 - 2627.80] Pharmaceuticals from 1989 or whatever is
[2626.24 - 2631.80] in your system and everything else going
[2627.80 - 2634.48] on is all in there that Gunk it stays
[2631.80 - 2637.60] liquefied but mcky and gunky and the
[2634.48 - 2639.16] liver has to send it up the bile duct
[2637.60 - 2640.96] sends it up the bile duct into the
[2639.16 - 2644.40] gallbladder where it's colder and then
[2640.96 - 2647.60] the stones form they coal kind of like
[2644.40 - 2650.96] liquid gold cools liquid metal
[2647.60 - 2653.20] cools and in that Gunk are heavy metals
[2650.96 - 2655.32] sure science and research they hav even
[2653.20 - 2656.28] looked at those stones good enough you
[2655.32 - 2658.16] think they're going to put that much
[2656.28 - 2660.84] money into it you know what's in those
[2658.16 - 2662.40] stones isn't just old old red blood dead
[2660.84 - 2663.44] red blood cells and Billy ruin or
[2662.40 - 2665.16] whatever it else that's in there and
[2663.44 - 2668.04] everything it's not just all that stuff
[2665.16 - 2671.60] and cholesterol those stones are filled
[2668.04 - 2673.48] with Metals junk garbage I mean you
[2671.60 - 2675.28] wouldn't believe Industrial Age stuff
[2673.48 - 2677.00] going back before your time for your
[2675.28 - 2678.72] forefather's time and passed on to you
[2677.00 - 2681.64] and passed on to you're can pass on to
[2678.72 - 2683.84] your children all that Gunk that's how
[2681.64 - 2685.60] it works and it cools down and the stone
[2683.84 - 2687.96] is formed stones are formed in the
[2685.60 - 2691.44] gallbladder so when you got it's
[2687.96 - 2693.24] unbelievable that I see out there these
[2691.44 - 2696.04] you know these natural doctors or
[2693.24 - 2697.68] whoever doctor or whatever whatever and
[2696.04 - 2699.96] is you know promoting these cleanses you
[2697.68 - 2703.92] got to buy for liver
[2699.96 - 2705.88] Stones I mean I I can't even but this is
[2703.92 - 2708.04] a prime example of how the
[2705.88 - 2709.52] misinformation is so thick out there
[2708.04 - 2713.00] it's like literally it's not just the
[2709.52 - 2715.52] Wild West it's like something far worse
[2713.00 - 2717.60] it's far worse out there it's like
[2715.52 - 2719.76] literally like anything goes and
[2717.60 - 2721.72] anything stupid goes that's how
[2719.76 - 2724.96] incredible it is out
[2721.72 - 2726.68] there that's unbelievable so and this is
[2724.96 - 2728.48] a part of it I'm being sarcastic because
[2726.68 - 2731.36] I've seen people hurt by this stuff and
[2728.48 - 2733.64] wasting time and tons of money tons of
[2731.36 - 2736.28] money time and energy and I've seen
[2733.64 - 2738.72] people hurt by it and it's depressing
[2736.28 - 2741.52] it's depressing you know someone asked
[2738.72 - 2742.72] me if I ever had depression before they
[2741.52 - 2744.08] you know they said have you ever had
[2742.72 - 2745.76] depression before because I know that
[2744.08 - 2747.48] people suffer from depression and I know
[2745.76 - 2749.20] why they suffer from depression because
[2747.48 - 2751.56] they got the Epstein bars dropping in
[2749.20 - 2753.40] all this all this neurotoxin feeding off
[2751.56 - 2755.52] the toxic heavy metals and heavy metals
[2753.40 - 2757.64] in the brain and neurotransmitters go
[2755.52 - 2760.16] they they dampen and let your lights
[2757.64 - 2761.76] drop and depression hits and people go
[2760.16 - 2763.48] get depressed they get they fall into
[2761.76 - 2765.20] this depression and then they go they
[2763.48 - 2766.80] try to take brain altering medication
[2765.20 - 2768.20] like the anxiety stuff and all the
[2766.80 - 2770.64] different anti-depressants and
[2768.20 - 2772.08] everything else and I get it I know why
[2770.64 - 2775.08] I've never had
[2772.08 - 2777.56] depression until I I see what's out
[2775.08 - 2780.16] there over the years till I see what's
[2777.56 - 2781.68] out there you know my depression hits I
[2780.16 - 2783.08] said you know I never had depression I
[2781.68 - 2785.04] said you know what I I got something
[2783.08 - 2786.52] that's it won't it it's not even like
[2785.04 - 2790.60] depression I guess
[2786.52 - 2792.48] but I got sadness sadness I got sadness
[2790.60 - 2793.68] on the misinformation and anything goes
[2792.48 - 2795.12] out there and what people get pushed
[2793.68 - 2796.80] into and what they have to spend money
[2795.12 - 2798.88] on and everything else they have to do
[2796.80 - 2800.72] unbelievable like with Liver Rescue I
[2798.88 - 2802.48] put a whole recipe book in Liver Rescue
[2800.72 - 2804.40] so there's two books in there because I
[2802.48 - 2806.68] don't want you even spending $1 more dos
[2804.40 - 2808.80] for another book to play that game I see
[2806.68 - 2810.24] what authors do they got there they put
[2808.80 - 2811.80] out their book and then they try to put
[2810.24 - 2813.68] out another book side of it which just
[2811.80 - 2815.00] here's the recipe book for that now why
[2813.68 - 2818.16] couldn't you put in the same book and
[2815.00 - 2822.16] save the person $15 you I've seen it all
[2818.16 - 2825.20] out there and the whole point is is this
[2822.16 - 2827.80] okay is this it's about you and that's
[2825.20 - 2829.28] what matters it's about you that's
[2827.80 - 2831.36] that's the point that should be taken no
[2829.28 - 2834.64] matter what it's about you and what we
[2831.36 - 2836.28] what can we do for you what can that's
[2834.64 - 2838.36] what people need to see that are selling
[2836.28 - 2840.20] all those those expensive supplements

[2840.20 - 2844.84] do for you how do we protect you and do
[2843.04 - 2846.88] it in a sensible Manner and give you the
[2844.84 - 2848.40] right information so not out there just
[2846.88 - 2851.12] guessing games of theories and
[2848.40 - 2853.88] misinformation due to you know people's
[2851.12 - 2855.36] pockets and so liver Stones is a big one
[2853.88 - 2856.96] that's why I'm on this rant right now
[2855.36 - 2858.72] you guys because liver Stones is a big
[2856.96 - 2860.20] one the whole liver Stone thing I got
[2858.72 - 2862.36] people say oh they flushed all these
[2860.20 - 2863.72] stones in the toilet these liver stones
[2862.36 - 2865.60] in the toilet it was all the herbal
[2863.72 - 2868.32] concoctions they were sold all these
[2865.60 - 2869.76] alcohol concoctions alcohol in the herbs
[2868.32 - 2871.96] all these liquid herbs and all these
[2869.76 - 2873.28] dried powdered herbs and all this stuff
[2871.96 - 2875.40] and they're taking all these herbs and
[2873.28 - 2877.88] mucus gets collected in the intestinal
[2875.40 - 2879.24] tract because it's reacting to all these
[2877.88 - 2880.96] herbs being thrown in there and the
[2879.24 - 2882.32] tannins and the herbs and herbs that
[2880.96 - 2884.84] shouldn't even be in people some of
[2882.32 - 2886.68] these herbs that's somebody has some big
[2884.84 - 2888.08] cockman idea some practi has a big
[2886.68 - 2889.68] cockman idea and they throw all these
[2888.08 - 2891.08] herb powders in you and all this other
[2889.68 - 2892.76] stuff and then you're sitting there
[2891.08 - 2894.52] pooping your brains out and you're
[2892.76 - 2896.68] looking for Stones when it's really
[2894.52 - 2898.00] mucus and old debris that could just be
[2896.68 - 2900.12] in the testal tract for your food or
[2898.00 - 2902.60] food attached to mucus and you think you
[2900.12 - 2904.52] see stones in the toilet liver stones
[2902.60 - 2905.84] and you get delusional when easily
[2904.52 - 2907.76] delusional when you're sitting there
[2905.84 - 2910.04] spending all that money taking all the
[2907.76 - 2911.68] stuff feeling like crap and doing this
[2910.04 - 2913.64] you you want to believe something's in
[2911.68 - 2915.32] that toilet I swear to God I've seen
[2913.64 - 2918.12] people go through this so many times
[2915.32 - 2919.72] it's ridiculous and let's go push into
[2918.12 - 2922.12] liver flushes well we have a couple more
[2919.72 - 2922.96] minutes left liver flesh is the one
[2922.12 - 2924.44] thing I'm going to tell you right now
[2922.96 - 2926.80] and I put in Liver Rescue so you know
[2924.44 - 2929.76] the liver does not like to be pushed it
[2926.80 - 2931.00] hates to be pushed in any way it's like
[2929.76 - 2932.88] you wouldn't want your son or your
[2931.00 - 2934.16] daughter being pushed by a drug Pusher
[2932.88 - 2935.60] that's for sure you wouldn't want your
[2934.16 - 2937.72] son and daughter being pushed by any
[2935.60 - 2939.20] anybody by a bully and pushed down in
[2937.72 - 2941.20] the playground you wouldn't want your
[2939.20 - 2943.24] son and daughter pushed by anything okay
[2941.20 - 2946.36] and that's the bottom line and your your
[2943.24 - 2948.28] liver is like basically a family member
[2946.36 - 2950.04] it's a family member and it's watching
[2948.28 - 2951.72] you and it's got your back and
[2950.04 - 2953.60] everything else you don't want to liver
[2951.72 - 2956.32] does not like to be pushed it doesn't
[2953.60 - 2958.20] like to be pushed off the diving board
[2956.32 - 2959.96] the first time in a first time on a
[2958.20 - 2961.32] diving board like a child having its
[2959.96 - 2962.92] first time on a diving board
[2961.32 - 2964.52] contemplating how the child is going to
[2962.92 - 2966.72] dump in he or she is going to jump in
[2964.52 - 2969.28] and dump into the water or whatever how
[2966.72 - 2970.36] you know what happens is is that when
[2969.28 - 2971.76] that's happening and someone comes
[2970.36 - 2974.36] behind the child and pushes that child
[2971.76 - 2977.08] in it could be a bad memory it could be
[2974.36 - 2979.88] a shock that child didn't deserve I've
[2977.08 - 2981.60] seen that happen too I mean it it you
[2979.88 - 2983.28] know that's that has happened or a
[2981.60 - 2985.76] brother or a sister pushing a child you
[2983.28 - 2987.68] know pushing a sibling into the water
[2985.76 - 2990.92] it's basically what the liver does not
[2987.68 - 2992.28] like to be pushed into anything
[2990.92 - 2993.76] especially flushing and I'll tell you
[2992.28 - 2995.60] why cuz when you flush the liver the
[2993.76 - 2998.08] wrong way or you try to push the liver
[2995.60 - 2999.96] to flush it all that poison and all that
[2998.08 - 3001.76] toxin goes into the bloodstream and you
[2999.96 - 3003.60] know what the liver does it tries to get
[3001.76 - 3005.36] it all back in it immediately to save
[3003.60 - 3006.92] your life because it's not going to be
[3005.36 - 3009.24] pushed what happens is when you push the
[3006.92 - 3010.80] liver and try to flush it like like a
[3009.24 - 3012.68] lot of these people are doing out there
[3010.80 - 3014.16] now like thinking they got liver fleshes
[3012.68 - 3016.44] thinking they got liver fleshes let's
[3014.16 - 3017.60] keep on doing this it's unbelievable
[3016.44 - 3019.56] what
[3017.60 - 3021.56] happens what you want to know what
[3019.56 - 3023.20] happens you shorten your life and not
[3021.56 - 3024.68] even know it you may not know it you may
[3023.20 - 3026.68] be going everything's fine and dandy but
[3024.68 - 3028.20] you took 5 years off off your life if
[3026.68 - 3030.84] you were going to live to be 80 you just
[3028.20 - 3033.56] you you're now going to be Liv to be 74
[3030.84 - 3036.08] 75 it could even be more than that I'll
[3033.56 - 3039.96] tell you why when the liver push too
[3036.08 - 3042.60] hard it ends up dumping all this poison
[3039.96 - 3045.56] into the system the poison hurts the
[3042.60 - 3047.92] heart Untold damage for the future can
[3045.56 - 3049.28] happen now you can you can you can look
[3047.92 - 3051.48] you can heal your liver and heal your
[3049.28 - 3054.60] body if you've done those things so that
[3051.48 - 3056.48] you can get get those 5 years back and
[3054.60 - 3058.44] then 10 years back back on top of it if
[3056.48 - 3060.56] you're doing the right things that's
[3058.44 - 3061.64] important and you can you can do all the
[3060.56 - 3063.04] right things for your liver I put a
[3061.64 - 3065.64] liver cleanse for the liver that's
[3063.04 - 3067.56] gentle but powerful it doesn't push your
[3065.64 - 3070.08] liver I put that in Liver Rescue for a
[3067.56 - 3072.88] reason I put that in Liver Rescue for a
[3070.08 - 3074.96] reason and what happens is when that
[3072.88 - 3077.16] liver dumps all that poison into the
[3074.96 - 3078.04] bloodstream it's injurious to the heart
[3077.16 - 3080.20] and
[3078.04 - 3082.00] brain it's not good for the heart and
[3080.20 - 3084.76] brain and the liver freaks out because
[3082.00 - 3087.24] it has to reabsorb that that toxin back
[3084.76 - 3089.32] in is fat fast as possible so then it
[3087.24 - 3091.36] sends out signals it sends out hormones
[3089.32 - 3093.32] to trigger off the adrenals to release
[3091.36 - 3094.96] adrenaline at a dangerous Pace even
[3093.32 - 3097.36] though even you may not feel it but
[3094.96 - 3099.24] there's a adrenaline is re releasing out
[3097.36 - 3101.48] when you're doing those liver flushes
[3099.24 - 3103.44] because the adrenaline's there to
[3101.48 - 3105.44] protect the brain and the Heart Is as
[3103.44 - 3107.52] fast as possible the liver calls out for
[3105.44 - 3109.48] help it weakens your adrenals the
[3107.52 - 3111.92] adrenaline has to be all absorbed right
[3109.48 - 3113.12] back into the liver along with all that
[3111.92 - 3115.08] poison you know what the liver does
[3113.12 - 3117.80] right after that it shuts down and it
[3115.08 - 3119.08] stop stops letting you push it so when
[3117.80 - 3120.44] you're still doing your liver flesh
[3119.08 - 3122.00] after that and you're still doing it
[3120.44 - 3123.88] Whatever It Is 30-day liver flesh or
[3122.00 - 3125.52] whatever you got going or bought into
[3123.88 - 3127.48] and you're still doing it your liver is
[3125.52 - 3130.04] now not even working because it won't
[3127.48 - 3132.28] let anything out of the gate
[3130.04 - 3135.44] anymore that's how it works because it
[3132.28 - 3136.48] let so much out of the gate so much that
[3135.44 - 3139.72] was
[3136.48 - 3141.20] detrimental and that's how it works and
[3139.72 - 3143.00] if your liver does let it out of the
[3141.20 - 3144.80] gate again because it has no choice
[3143.00 - 3147.20] because it's been pushed by some strange
[3144.80 - 3149.92] concoction
[3147.20 - 3151.76] and that's even worse and has to do it
[3149.92 - 3152.64] all over again to try to protect you
[3151.76 - 3155.00] liver
[3152.64 - 3156.76] flushes that are unauthorized by the
[3155.00 - 3158.72] human body and the liver itself
[3156.76 - 3161.72] unauthorized by the liver itself is not
[3158.72 - 3163.80] a good thing it's not a good thing at
[3161.72 - 3165.16] all and if you're someone that's new to
[3163.80 - 3166.52] the show and new to my information and
[3165.16 - 3168.32] you're confused and saying well I don't
[3166.52 - 3169.64] get it then what makes your information
[3168.32 - 3171.80] like any better or
[3169.64 - 3173.24] whatever it is it because of the
[3171.80 - 3174.76] countless people I've helped recover
[3173.24 - 3176.28] over the years and the decades is it
[3174.76 - 3178.44] because of that or is because of my
[3176.28 - 3181.20] source that I have yes it's because of
[3178.44 - 3183.00] my source it's because of all that it's
