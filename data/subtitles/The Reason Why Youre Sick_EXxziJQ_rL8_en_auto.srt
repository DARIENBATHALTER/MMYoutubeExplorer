talking about longevity do you know that

42
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,360
you just lived your life you lived your

43
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,159
life and if you got sick later on or

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
something happened then okay right but

45
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,920
now people are just freaking out anyway

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,320
talking about the immune system what I

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
what I have right here is the vimergy

48
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,960
propolis pure that's an experience if

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,600
you ever ever have an opportunity to

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,719
have that bottle in your hand and to

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,560
actually taste it and use it you'll

52
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,799
you'll feel the frequency it's unmatched

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,039
it's unbelievable the frequency that's

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,280
in there the living corsin that's

55
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,640
actually in there so living corsin is in

56
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,439
the propolis pure and this is the vimer

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
propolis pure okay if you don't know the

58
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,759
company it's V as and Victor i m as in

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
Mary e r g why and you guys know I

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,319
endorse these guys and it's for a reason

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,360
because there's nothing like it out

62
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,800
there when it comes down to immune

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,920
system if if I'm if I just go oh

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,239
whatever don't even bother telling

65
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,519
people anymore don't even whatever

66
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:29,200
people get sick out there then that is

67
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,440
just that is wrong I have to fight for

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,480
it I have to tell people what can help

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,400
them I have to tell them look this is

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,160
what's going on with your immune system

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,360
you need a maintenance you need a

72
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,720
maintenance plan of some kind that's

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,720
critical because in the end people are

74
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,040
just getting sick they got symptoms and

75
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,560
there's a reason and guess what it's

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,560
because their immune system is breaking

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,319
down it's because their immune system is

78
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,120
falling apart yes let's be honest let's

79
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,400
be straight out with it let's call it

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,239
like it is if someone's sick their

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,879
immune system system is not functioning

82
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,680
properly it was compromised to such a

83
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,480
degree that it can't do its job

84
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,080
compromised so it actually can't do its

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,319
job think about that for a minute right

86
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,040
there if we're walking around sick and

87
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,799
we got aches and pains and Tinkles and

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
numbness and our jaw hurts and our neck

89
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,120
hurts and our head hurts and we have

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,879

fungus immune system you got anything

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,920
tumors whatever that's happening inside

107
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,280
our body calcification throughout our

body kidney weak weaknesses adrenal

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,680
problems all immune system based think

110
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,680
about that for a minute right there okay

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,239
and if we don't call it like it is and

112
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
if we play footsies with it because

113
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,400
that's what's happening out there I see

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,120
it every day out there you see all these

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,120
people out there these coaches and these

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,919
practitioners and all these gurus out

117
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,600
there and they're all playing footsies

118
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,240
with people yeah you can have longevity

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,320
just go and take this and do this oh you

120
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,600
can have this but nobody's calling it

121
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,600
like it it is and saying the immune

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,840
system is compromised in this world in

123
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,720
people's Health the immune system is

124
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,280
actually falling apart that's why people

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
are having autoimmune in all these

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,160
different symptoms and conditions and if

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
we don't address the immune system if we

128
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,880
don't want to know what's bothering our

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,960
immune system that's one thing and we're

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
going to cover that and that's what

131
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,600
we're talking about today if we don't

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
want to know what's bothering our immune

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,560
system which is antagonizing our immune

134
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,240
system we actually have to at least know

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,720
how to protect our immune system or keep

136
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,039
it strong and help rebuild it if we want

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
to be in the dark about what's causing

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,080
our immune system problems it's one

139
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,800
thing we have to at least not be in the

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,120
dark and actually support our immune

141
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,360
system and do what we need to do so

142
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,280
right here in front of me I got the

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
propolis pure right there okay I was

144
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
telling you guys yesterday about mouth

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,280
ulcers oral health so many people are

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560

worried about their mouth they're

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
worried about their teeth and their gums

149
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,880
they're worried about their tongue yeah

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
their tongue there's people out there

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,360
and they're scraping their tongue and

152
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,919
they're doing all this on their tongue

153
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,199
and they got sores on their tongue that

154
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,639
they don't understand they feel

155
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,720
something in the roof of their mouth and

156
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,800
they're playing with their tongue all

157
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,800
the time because and they're feeling

158
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,520
teeth and they're feeling their gums and

159
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,360
like what's wrong here what's wrong

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,919
there they go to the dentist they go to

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
the doctor they're looking at their

162
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,520
mouth and then they're checking their

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,720
stools and checking everything else

164
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,759
they're like well I don't know if you

165
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,280
got thrush or this or mouth ulcers or or

166
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,880
canker saurs people with oral health

167
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,880
they're swishing around coconut oil as

168
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,199
if that's going to do anything and I

169
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,759
talked about that and I've written about

170
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,560
that in the medical medium books where

171
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,319
it doesn't do anything and now people

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
are actually poaching that info and

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,440
they're like yeah bacteria is on their

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,520
teeth and gums and coating it with

175
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,160
coconut oil doesn't stop the bacteria

176
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,160
from eating away the teeth and gums

177
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,520
medical medium

178
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,280
information the point is with propolis

179
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,639
pure it's for oral health big part of

180
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,960
your immune system is your mouth it's

181
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,120
your mouth that's a big part of your

182
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,919
immune system and so that's why propolis

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,479
is so critical I just saw somebody it's

184
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,039
viy vimergy.com V is in Victor i m is in

185
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,479
Mary E RG y so that's propolis pure I'll

186
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,000
talking about that and probably we'll

187
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,599
talk more about it and then you got the

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,039
cats claw which we can go into so let's

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
let's get into our immune system a

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,240
little bit I want to do a little bit

191
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,039
more of the bloodstream right here okay

192
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,360
you guys little bit more of the

193
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
bloodstream

194
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,120
all right there it is your

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,120
bloodstream okay right and in your

196
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,000
bloodstream okay you have your blood

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,520
there it

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,400
is inside your

199
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,199
bloodstream all right your bloodstreams

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,560
moving you got immune cells you got

201
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,319
immune cells in here in your

202
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,680
bloodstream these immune cells travel

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:34,240
with your blood many of them swim up

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,120
stream that's right many of them swim

205
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,639
upstream a lot of immune cells have the

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,440
ability to swim isn't that interesting

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,080
they can travel on their own Propel

208
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,520
themselves on their own now in order to

209
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,400
stay healthy throughout your life it's

210
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,960
more than just hey you know uh let me

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,319
support my immune system it's more than

212
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,879
that it's also understanding what your

213
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,120
immune system is even doing because you

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,360
need to connect to it critical to

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,360
connect to your immune cells and so

216
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
knowing that your immune cells sit

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,840
inside your bloodstream and they swim

218
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Downstream on the river in the river and

219
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
some of them swim upstream against the

220
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,319
current okay so I want to show you what

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,280
happens so this is going this is going

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
right that's your that's your direction

223
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,000
that's your stream I'm just going to

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,479
show you right here it's going this way

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,240
check this out this is really

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,120
interesting okay you got immune cells

227
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,320
right

228
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,760
here and in your bloodstream you got

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,640
immune cells that are traveling with

230
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,440
your blood and they're going this way

231
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,919
they're going in this direction okay but

232
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
then you have immune cells that are

233
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,399
going the opposite direction why would

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
they do that why would immune Cells Go

235
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,600
the opposite direction you ready for

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,000
this they're going the opposite

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,959
direction because they're looking out

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,760
for

239
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,760
Invaders they're looking out for

240
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,560
Invaders so your immune cells many of

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,079
them will swim the opposite direction

242
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,680
look at this you see the arrow going the

243
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,880
opposite direction you guys your

244
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,360
bloodstreams going this

245
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,360
direction you got immune cells that are

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,560
actually going the opposite direction

247
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,200
interesting they have power strength

248
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,079
they can do that and they usually do

249
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,200
that by do walking the lining of your

250
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,200
veins and arteries see this now what

251
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
happens is the reason why they go the

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,680
other direction is because they're

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,279
trying to stop something and catch

254
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,600
something you

255
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,519
ready they're trying to catch something

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,240
they're trying to catch an

257
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,160
Invader okay that's right viruses and

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,839
any bacteria here it is you got the

259
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,880
viruses coming through and the bacteria

260
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:55,000
look at this okay check that out

261
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,160
pathogens they're trying to stop

262
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,399
pathogens the Invaders so your immune

263
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Cells Go go

264
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,800
backwards they actually go backwards

265
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,200
because they need to it's critical that

266
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,920
they try to stop the Invaders when

267
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,320
they're actually swimming Upstream when

268
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,040
they're swimming sorry Downstream with

269
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,839
your bloodstream like that Invaders like

270
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,640
to go with the stream of your blood they

271
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,959
like to travel with the stream of your

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,120
blood that's how the Epstein bar the

273
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,600
hhv6 the ceglar virus the herpes simplex

274
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,000
one herpes simplex 2 the shingles all

275
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,440
the HHS that are undiscovered HH uh V10

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,680
through 16 right that medical be

277
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
information talks about and all the

278
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,240
different variations the 100 varieties

279
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,399
of EPC bar because the varieties are

280
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,560
expanding every single day it's not it's

281
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,360
no longer 60 varieties like I've

282
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,000
actually put in the books it's way more

283
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,839
now and it's the same thing with

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
shingles okay all those bugs and viruses

285
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,120
are partly responsible for why your

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
immune system is giving up on people and

287
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,399
that's a good point is it giving up is

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,320
it not no it's not it's fighting like

289
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:11,560
hell it's fighting hard so what happens

290
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,480
is your immune cells they walk backwards

291
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,079
because you're trying to stop the

292
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,519
pathogens that are in the bloodstream

293
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,600
the reason why they go backwards is they

294
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,040
battle head on with the pathogen as the

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,560
pathogen is coming in head on collision

296
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,600
so that's what they do it's like a car

297
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,079
going down the highway and somebody

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,240
getting on the wrong exit and coming

299
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,519
back on the highway and here we go we

300
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,680
got a car coming down at 70 M an hour

301
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,959
and then we got right we got another car

302
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,160
coming up at 70 M an hour totally

303
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,920
confused doesn't know they're on the

304
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,639
wrong side of the highway and then they

305
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,399
crash same thing the immune cells are

306
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,680
actually going Upstream the pathogens

307
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:55,959
are cruising Downstream and then they

308
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,560
crash that's how it's done the reason

309
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,120
why it's done like that is immune cells

310
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,040
have a difficult time fighting pathogens

311
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,519
while they're all swimming Downstream at

312
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,880
the same time very important to know why

313
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,680
is it important it's part of connecting

314
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,160
to our immune system every little bit we

315
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
know strengthens the immune system so

316
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,839
when you fortify it you're not only just

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,519
fortifying it with tools like the

318
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,680
propolis pure right propolis and the

319
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,199
Kats claw and the total immune which is

320
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,360
Molen in time you're not just fortifying

321
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,720
your immune cells which we're going to

322
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,839
cover in a minute you're actually

323
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,279
connecting you're you're understanding

324
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,800
what you're immune cells are trying to

325
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,959
accomplish the Consciousness Connection

326
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,040
matters because our immune system can

327
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,120
talk to our Consciousness they can work

328
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,480
together very important

329
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,880
here so as Invaders are going Downstream

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,800
like this you got immune cells walking

331
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,680
Upstream to try to crash into them it's

332
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,000
a surprise attack on the Invader The

333
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,600
Invader doesn't expect it as it's

334
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,240
cruising around going down the street it

335
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,959
doesn't expect a surprise attack a car

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,440
coming up the highway the wrong way you

337
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
don't expect that either if you're on

338
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,560
the highway and a car comes on the exit

339
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
the wrong way and and is going up the

340
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,639
highway while you're going down the

341
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,480
highway you're not expecting it and then

342
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,959
boom that's how it works the immune

343
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,800
cells know in your body that the Invader

344
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,720
the Epstein bar yes the shingles the

345
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,519
hhv6 is not expecting a headon

346
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,320
collision that's how how it's done but

347
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,279
in order you're ready for this in order

348
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,360
for your immune cells to have the

349
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,199
strength strength it needs to swim

350
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,279
upstream it needs to be

351
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,120
fed it needs to be supported it's why

352
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,880
it's critical to have a

353
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,560
maintenance critical not just a onetime

354
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,839
thing like I'll take this one year for a

355
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,800
month and that's it or I'll take this

356
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,959
for a week it needs support all the time

357
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,880
a maintenance support so it can keep its

358
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:11,160
strength up now somebody somebody might

359
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,240
have a weakened immune system so when

360
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,880
pathogens are going Downstream here we

361
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,240
go pathogens are going Downstream right

362
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,600
there they go going

363
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,560
Downstream as they're going Downstream

364
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,079
your immune cells can't walk back they

365
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,560
don't have the strength to actually walk

366
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,920
back they can't do the surprise element

367
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,120
the surprise attack is not easy for them

368
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,199
they can't do the head-on collision and

369
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
because they can't do the head-on

370
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,160
collision there you go you break out in

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,360
shingles finally in your life you break

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
out shingles or there you go you have a

373
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,040
non rashing shingles and that non-

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,680
rashing shingles is kicking your butt

375
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
and you got pain everywhere in your body

376
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
and you're hurting all kinds of ways

377
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,959
your tongue your tongue hurts it's

378
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,839
buzzing it's tingling it's numb your

379
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,800
body hurts and that's how it goes or you

380
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,720
got trigeminal neuralgic because your

381
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,320
herpes simplex one is going out of

382
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,440
control and it's getting into the

383
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,560
trigeminal nerve or the shingles virus

384
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,920
is getting into the trigeminal nerve if

385
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,320
we don't do a maintenance and take care

386
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,160
of our immune system you guys what

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,360
happens is your immune cells they lose

388
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,519
their strength and they can't do the

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,759
head-on collision

390
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,920
backwards they can't they can't do the

391
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,959
surprise element the surprise attack

392
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,240
which is the

393
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,360
pathogen is Flowing Downstream nice and

394
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,920
fast here it is and when a pathogen

395
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,680
flows Downstream get ready for

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,560
this it stays

397
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,560
strong when a pathogen like an Epstein

398
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,440
bar virus or any kind of bacteria strep

399
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,720
bacteria when it flows Downstream with

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,040
the river of your blood it stays nice

401
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,040
and strong the reason why it stays nice

402
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,680
and strong because it doesn't have to do

403
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,160
anything it's flowing with the river but

404
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,319
your immune cells they have to work hard

405
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,560
and they need strength they need a

406
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,800
maintenance for strength because they

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
have to go upstream and when the immune

408
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,560
Cells Go Upstream it takes so much

409
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,920
energy and so much strength and they

410
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,040
need that strength so when your Epstein

411
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,639
bar leaves your liver because it's going

412
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,040
for hay mononucleosis again it's going

413
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,759
for hey another another infection low

414
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
grade infection it's going again for

415
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,000
another high grade infection your epine

416
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,759
VAR here it goes you've been under

417
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,240
stress all kinds of problems you got

418
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,079
exposure exposure to poisons and toxins

419
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,959
and chemicals or whatever it is and here

420
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,600
it is there goes your epscene bar it's

421
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,279
flowing Downstream guess what it has all

422
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,399
the strength in the world because it

423
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,880
doesn't have to do anything it's flowing

424
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,920
with the stream right and guess what

425
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,639
it's doing it's feeding on all kinds of

426
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,800
poisons and crap and toxins and all

427
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,720
kinds of garbage in your blood and it's

428
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,600
having a field day A Feast while it's

429
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,679
swimming Downstream just relaxing and

430
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,760
flowing Downstream and then your immune

431
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,799
cells right here see these they have to

432
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,839
go the opposite way they have to have

433
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,439
strength they have to have stamina and

434
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,600
they have to go the opposite way to do a

435
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,360
head-on

436
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,919
collision with that virus or that

437
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,280
pathogen so your immune Cells Go

438
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,000
Downstream go upstream and they go

439
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,400
against the current and then they crash

440
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,039
right there with that pathogen and they

441
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,720
need strength and that's why they need a

442
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,120
maintenance because people's immune

443
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,080
systems are breaking down they're

444
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,200
weakened every single day and as they're

445
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,360
weakened and broken down guess what our

446
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,799
immune cells can't go Upstream easy in

447
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,039
fact a lot of people their immune cells

448
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,960
can't go Upstream at all can't even they

449
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,280
don't even have the strength to go

450
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,640
Upstream at all and so if we're not

451
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,520
doing something if we're not feeding our

452
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,440
immune cells and strengthening them and

453
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,919
knocking pathogens down

454
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,919
ourselves we can get in trouble 10

455
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,840
symptoms now we got 20 symptoms yeah

456
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,960
that's right now you got 30 symptoms a

457
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
lot of people have 100 symptoms they can

458
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,080
count them they have them they they

459
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,200
actually Journal them I have a pain in

460
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,000
my jaw that just came back again I got a

461
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,840
ringing in my ear that just came back

462
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,640
again I got ringing in both ears that's

463
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,280
another symptom I have I was a little

464
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,200
dizzy the other day that's another

465
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,320
symptom I had a panic attack that's

466
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,159
another symptom they add up real quick

467
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
real

468
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,760
quick love and healing says over there

469
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,400
in IG I haven't been sick longer than 2

470
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,840
days because of vimergy supplements in

471
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,799
the last 3 and a half years along with

472
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,840
medical mean and Protocols of course

473
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,559
it's so amazing now I look I give a lot

474
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,480
of credit a lot of credit to a really

475
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,280
high powered good supplement okay I give

476
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,120
a lot of credit to that I do when it's

477
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,520
one that actually works and I know it's

478
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,080
as pure and clean as it is a lot of

479
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,679
credit to it and I've seen that propolis

480
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,600
right here I've seen this perform things

481
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,720
like certain Miracles with people that

482
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,880
are just mindblowing that's what I've

483
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,480
seen okay same thing with the cat's claw

484
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,159
that's another one right there too and

485
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,520
the total immune as well really

486
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,320
Incredible God was with us last night

487
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,840
our home was hit by a tornado storm

488
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,360
sounded like a train coming through our

489
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,240
house so much work to be done but so

490
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,120
thankful and blessed I healed with

491
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,799
medical medium to handle it first of all

492
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,120
look God bless you and I'm so sorry sole

493
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,000
purpose with Sarah I'm so sorry you

494
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,440
actually have gone through that I've

495
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,559
been in some storms I've been in some

496
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,840
hurricanes I've been in a tornado right

497
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,520
not as close as that not as close as

498
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,000
that we I haven't been in one in that

499
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,960
the way you have um Sarah that's that's

500
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,880
terrifying okay I've been in hurricanes

501
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
really bad ones and been in the uh the

502
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,280
the Eye of Hur hurricanes but not

503
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,240
tornado have been near tornadoes but

504
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,480
that's scary and and incredible that you

505
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,320
actually have the strength now to power

506
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,039
through that so I'm talking about the

507
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,760
immune system if you guys just got on

508
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,720
here why it's critical for maintenance

509
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,400
and what our immune system does lay over

510
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,960
there on YouTube since I am doing your

511
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,679
protocols I am not sick every month

512
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,400
before my menstration so that that's

513
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,919
interesting BEC that's so powerful what

514
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,159
happens is menstruation knocks the

515
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,360
immune system down naturally because a

516
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,080
woman's immune system has to go to the

517
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,039
reproductive system during menstration

518
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
and so it leaves less of an immune

519
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,320
system other places so women get all

520
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,919
kinds of different symptoms before

521
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,679
menstration during menstration and

522
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,480
shortly after they get all kinds of

523
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,720
symptoms they get all kinds of things

524
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,919
that happen and so your immune system

525
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,840
strengthening that means the 20% of your

526
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,440
immune system that is still everywhere

527
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,080
else during your menstration it's

528
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,440
stronger it's stronger than what it used

529
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,400
to be so you actually not getting sick

530
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,039
before menstruation means that the the

531
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,000
part of your immune system that's

532
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,240
handling everything else is actually

533
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,799
stronger than it used to be that's

534
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,760
powerful that's incredible so we're

535
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,600
talking about the bloodstream the

536
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,559
bloodstream flows right the river that

537
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:24,880
flows okay and in that River all

538
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,559
right pathogens and toxins flow

539
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,440
Downstream that's what they do because

540
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:33,600
the reason why pathogens flow

541
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,279
Downstream is so the pathogen doesn't

542
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,400
have to use strength and energy keeps

543
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:43,039
the pathogen nice and strong so the

544
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,919
pathogen flows right

545
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,039
Downstream just like this with the blood

546
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,960
pathogen flows Downstream just like this

547
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,039
with the blood okay it makes it so the

548
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,320
pathogen doesn't have to expel any

549
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,919
energy it makes it so the pathogen

550
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,960
doesn't have to weaken okay immune cell

551
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,159
in order to have the surprise element

552
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,159
and the surprise attack your immune

553
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:10,240
Cells Go Upstream like I was saying

554
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,919
before the goal surprise attack on the

555
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,600
pathogen slam the pathogen head on and

556
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,039
engulf the pathogen so here's how it

557
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,760
works your immune cells are supposed to

558
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,600
devour a pathogen keep this in mind

559
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,840
there's your immune Cell It's supposed

560
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,520
to engulf a pathogen like eat it up and

561
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,880
devour it so you're immune cell is

562
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
supposed to actually engulf the pathogen

563
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,240
so the pathogen is gone right check that

564
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,000
out this is interesting

565
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,559
now guess how guess what helps your

566
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,520
immune cell to engulf a

567
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,520
pathogen headon Collision going Upstream

568
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,320
while the pathogen is going Downstream

569
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,880
you ready for this here's your immune

570
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,960
cell it's going Upstream it needs the

571
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,960
strength to swim upstream here it's

572
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,840
going pathogen is going Downstream boom

573
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,640
as they Li your white blood cell tries

574
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,960
to engulf the pathogen in one shot

575
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,960
swallowing and devouring

576
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,120
it and all that is fine and

577
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,960
dandy if your immune cells have the

578
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,679
strength to do it because they're

579
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,000
supposed to do that so you don't get the

580
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,640
next flare so you don't have a new

581
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,919
flare a flare up that's right so now

582
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,840
you're all flared up

583
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,720
you need the strong immune system the

584
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,279
immune cells need to have that strength

585
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,360
so when they go head on like that they

586
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,799
engulf that immune that that the immune

587
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,600
cell engulfs that pathogen that virus

588
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,520
like the Epstein bar the hhv6 the

589
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,640
shingles C cegal virus

590
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,919
HPV even

591
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,600
HPV hpylori

592
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,600
bacteria

593
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:00,240
strep other bacteria and engulfs it and

594
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,440
devours it because it goes upstream and

595
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,720
it hits it head on and when it hits it

596
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,120
head on it can swallow it inlf it it can

597
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,279
go right through its membrane into the

598
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,720
immune cell and then it can actually eat

599
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,400
that pathogen and explode it and kill it

600
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,840
but you got to have a maintenance you

601
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,679
got to be doing things to be feeding

602
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,799
your immune cells and keeping them

603
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,320
strong that's what's critical Max vond

604
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,039
over there on YouTube hey how you doing

605
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,559
wow I have a new respect for my immune

606
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,440
cells and that respect is the connection

607
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,880
that's the whole point you got to have

608
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,640
that connection to your immune cells and

609
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,240
know what they're doing so that when you

610
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,640
support it you're supporting it slim

611
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,520
over there on IG I've been on celery

612
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,240
juice nice I've been on celery juice HMT

613
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,399
hmds since August and it's been

614
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,880
lifechanging brain fog Gone Gone

615
00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:01,760
ADHD amazing totally off Aderall

616
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,360
boom thyroid medication almost

617
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:10,559
completely off boom thank you aw and

618
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,320
so incredible I just got to sit with

619
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,000
that for a second is that okay you guys

620
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,320
because think about think about his

621
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,600
journey think about his journey it's

622
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,640
incredible

623
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,399
incredible having this connection to our

624
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,880
immune cells means a lot because it

625
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,279
helps us keep on track it helps us

626
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,320
realize what our immune cells have to do

627
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,080
how how hard they work having this

628
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,640
understanding is a big deal right and

629
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,760
then being able to fortify our AB it's

630
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,640
one thing to say you know because I I

631
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,840
look I talked to Spirit of compassion

632
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,159
and I'm like well I tell people about

633
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,840
their immune system I'm only human I'm

634
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:54,360
doing my best I'm I'm only I'm doing my

635
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,840
best I have all these books I'm out

636
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,120
there talking about the immune system

637
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,440
Spirit I'm trying my

638
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:09,279
best what more can I do and so is like

639
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,600
explain the immune system talk about it

640
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,720
show people what their immune cell is

641
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,399
actually doing and have them connect to

642
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,880
it so they can get out of chronic

643
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:20,480
illness survive their chronic

644
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,399
illnesses because the immune system is

645
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,480
under respected

646
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:29,159
undervalued and so is like underr it

647
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,840
undervalued immune systems

648
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,880
taken for granted we take our immune

649
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,520
cells for granted and you know what even

650
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
when we get sick people take it for

651
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,919
granted and they still do and so it's

652
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,159
critical to know how it works what's

653
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,559
going on and what's supportive so what

654
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,120
can we do about it first of all you know

655
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,760
you want to avoid all the different

656
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,640
toxins the best you can throw out the

657
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,720
air fresheners throw out the scented

658
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,080
candles get rid of the Clones get rid of

659
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,720
the perfumes get rid of the fabric

660
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,640
softeners that are blowing out all that

661
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,240
chemical get rid of all the detergents

662
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,399
that are blowing out all that chemical

663
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,440
right be cautious which with bleach be

664
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:09,399
cautious if you're if you're a bleach

665
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:13,440
user that's an immune system

666
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:17,200
dropper you smell bleach immune system

667
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,799
drops you smell bleach it gets in you

668
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,640
immune system drops

669
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,440
bleach yes

670
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,440
right bleach actually meaning you know

671
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
what I mean any kind of thing like that

672
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,559
chlorine

673
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,080
you know anything like that immune

674
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,720
system drops and that's important to

675
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,000
know how it works these people don't

676
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,320
realize it they you know they smell

677
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
things and they don't know what those

678
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,640
things are doing okay when you're

679
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,600
filling your tank try to look for the

680
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,840
breeze that's going the opposite way go

681
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,320
on the other side of the the nozzle you

682
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,279
know when you're holding that nozzle and

683
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,519
you're breathing in all that

684
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,240
petrochemical and everything try to kind

685
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,000
of stand back a little bit if you can

686
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,320
set the nozzle you set the nozzle and

687
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,039
you stand back a little bit while it's

688
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,519
filling or trying to get kind of like

689
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,640
away from the the fumes that are coming

690
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,640
into you that lowers the immune system

691
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
don't get your carpets

692
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,559
cleaned you get your carpets cleaned

693
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,320
with conventional cleaning you know like

694
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,080
detergents and stuff like that they come

695
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,120
in that chemical is just going in you

696
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,159
constantly knowing what your immune

697
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,799
system is up against is part of the

698
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,159
problem it's connecting to that being

699
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,159
aware and proactive keep that in mind so

700
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,880
you're being proactive because you know

701
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,440
what your immune system is up against

702
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,640
that's a big thing so it's about like

703
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,080
different chemicals now we we might not

704
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,399
be able to avoid all the chemicals

705
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,679
falling out of the sky and we we might

706
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,640
not be able to avoid the cologne that's

707
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,559
you know someone's living with you and

708
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,200
they're saturated and we got to breathe

709
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:47,840
it in all the time but it's important

710
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,360
because we can get rid of what we what

711
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,720
we can get rid of move things away from

712
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,880
us that that are intoxicating us being

713
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,559
cautious and that helps the immune

714
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,840
system okay prevents taking your immune

715
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,960
system for granted we're aware of it all

716
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,360
the time it's deeply connected to no

717
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,679
connecting to no this here's how it

718
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,720
works if we just say oh yeah I don't

719
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,200
like scented candles fragrances aren't

720
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,960
good for you fine if we say fragrances

721
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,799
are actually challenging our immune

722
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,399
cells as they go Upstream then we're

723
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,360
we're not that's not good it's good to

724
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:25,480
know that but it's not good to know it's

725
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,679
not good that it's happening so

726
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,679
fragrances travel in the bloodstream too

727
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,200
you smell it on the outside it's on the

728
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,600
inside you smell cologne you have

729
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,440
cologne in your

730
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,760
bloodstream did you know that if you're

731
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,960
smelling cologne it's in your

732
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,840
bloodstream if you smell air freshener

733
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,960
it's in your bloodstream if you smell

734
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,440
petrochemical coming out of the the gas

735
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,720
the gas nozzle it's in your bloodstream

736
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,720
and that that stuff is traveling with

737
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,360
your bloodstream so pathogens love to

738
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,399
eat that stuff feed on all those toxins

739
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,559
and chemicals the pathogens love that

740
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,399
stuff right but when our immune cells

741
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:07,039
right here when they got to walk back

742
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,080
and swim upstream they're getting

743
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,840
slammed with all kinds of different

744
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,679
chemicals our immune cells need to be

745
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,440
protected so let's talk about how to

746
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,440
protect that immune cell right there

747
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,399
here's our immune cells right here okay

748
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,440
going to draw a few of them right

749
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,440
here okay we got our immune cells right

750
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,640
here here they

751
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,000
are so how does an immune cell get

752
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,600
stronger

753
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,519
ER

754
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:38,720
okay it gets stronger by being

755
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:42,279
fed immune cells feed on phytochemical

756
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,320
compounds that aren't even detected by

757
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,600
science and research yet it's going to

758
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,360
take a trillion dollars and more

759
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,720
trillions of dollars throughout the next

760
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,200
hundred years for science and research

761
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,799
to look into every phytochemical

762
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,960
compound just a b alone pick up nectar

763
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,279
and pollen

764
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,760
somewhere right you're talking about

765
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,039
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

766
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,559
photochemical compounds that are

767
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,159
undiscovered by science of research just

768
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,399
from a bee grabbing some

769
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,360
pollen that's what we're talking about

770
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:19,240
our immune system

771
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,200
okay is gobbling things down that we

772
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,360
don't even

773
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,960
understand when you eat

774
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,600
something okay when you eat something or

775
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,760
immune cells are taking from that

776
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,600
food okay when you eat something when

777
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,840
you eat something our immune cells are

778
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,639
taking from that food see this you guys

779
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,720
they're taking things from the food you

780
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,159
don't know about they're taking things

781
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,200
from the food no one knows about science

782
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,559
doesn't know about nothing knows

783
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,159
about and that's what our immune cells

784
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,760
doing they're eating things we do not

785
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,039
have our finger on the pulse of keep

786
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,279
that in mind that's what immune cell do

787
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,240
and then when it comes down to powerful

788
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,639
herbs like Thy like in the total immune

789
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,480
Thyme and

790
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:13,080
Molen those are immune system enhancer

791
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,639
and Builders because there are things

792
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,679
constituents in these these herbs like

793
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,320
Thyme and

794
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,840
Molen that enter into the immune

795
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,000
cell very important to

796
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,679
know and the immune cell gains strength

797
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,480
and radiate strength

798
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:38,360
when that's entering in look immune

799
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,200
cells gaining strength and vibrancy

800
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,440
that's how you have to see your immune

801
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,840
cells you guys see that you need to see

802
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,360
them strong radiating outward

803
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,960
right so when you're doing your propolis

804
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,159
pure envision your immune cells feeding

805
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,360
off of that propolis pure envision your

806
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,399
immune cells feeding off of that cat's

807
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,120
claw the phytochemical compounds and

808
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,159
cats claw that enhance the immune system

809
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,320
envision your immune cells feeding off

810
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,519
of time and

811
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,480
Mullen and even zinc and restoring and

812
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,080
strengthening it's easy to get

813
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,039
distracted out there with so much

814
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,519
information coming at you all day long

815
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,120
on social and everything top five this

816
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,799
top three this for your whatever top

817
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,039
seven things you can do for your sex

818
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:29,519
life top eight things you can do it long

819
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,840
for longevity number one eat colostrum

820
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,639
that's not that's no that's not good for

821
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,639
you it's not good for

822
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,159
you point is is that what that's what

823
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,519
we're up against but we don't realize

824
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,039
what our immune system needs and then we

825
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,840
don't realize our immune system is

826
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,440
screwing up how many people get sick

827
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,080
with a symptom go to the

828
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,399
doctor an immune system wasn't even

829
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,120
mentioned even if some someone gets an

830
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,399
autoimmune

831
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,399
diagnosis it's not about like your

832
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,480
immune system needing to heal and get

833
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,560
stronger and strengthen it's about your

834
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,560
immune system attacking itself attacking

835
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,280
your body attacking your organs doesn't

836
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,960
even make any sense because our immune

837
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,599
system doesn't attack our own organs

838
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,040
doesn't attack her own glands that was a

839
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,760
theory in

840
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,440
1950 the point is is our immune

841
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,320
cells they need strength they need

842
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,639
Vitality they need energy and we need to

843
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,440
give them things on a maintenance level

844
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,280
so they can strengthen so they can swim

845
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,720
upstream and clobber the pathogens that

846
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,919
are making everybody sick and toxins and

847
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,599
pathogens you need that immune cell to

848
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:49,200
be strong as an ox to go swim upstream

849
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,520
why the pathogen is going Downstream

850
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,599
relaxing it's got its shades on it's

851
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,760
chilling it's got its lawn chair it's

852
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,320
just going for a ride that's what the

853
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,400
upen bar is doing and then your white

854
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,880
blood's cell needs to collide and Gobble

855
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,359
it down and engulf it just like

856
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,240
that order to do that strengthen the

857
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,720
ammun system you need maintenance stuff

858
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,359
Julie Tuesday Julie Tuesday 144 I see on

859
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,240
YouTube all the time a w how can we

860
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,320
support our bone marrow so that it can

861
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,200
birth stronger immune

862
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,079
cells okay getting toxic heavy metals

863
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,040
out is a big part of that okay all the

864
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,760
different books on that medical medium

865
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,520
books right all the different stuff the

866
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,079
brain saver books okay I'm hiding behind

867
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,760
here right now if you guys don't mind

868
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,400
voila here I

869
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,599
am okay getting the metals out

870
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,599
strengthens the bone marrow for immune

871
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,560
Health notice that very interesting

872
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:53,520
Spirit of compassion huh yep the

873
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,920
original heavy metal detox that medical

874
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,200
me put out there nobody talked about

875
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,880
Metals all these years

876
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,599
medical medum information put it out

877
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,200
there the original heavy metal detox the

878
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
one that actually works I love how

879
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
people have done all kinds of spin-offs

880
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm going to put this in here I'm going

881
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,079
to put great it's not going to work

882
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,960
anymore great you did a disservice to

883
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,839
people the heavy metal detox right there

884
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,680
that gets the metals out the heavy metal

885
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,599
detox is really critical for getting

886
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,800
Metals out of Bones and bone marrow and

887
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,520
that improves the immune cells

888
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,240
interesting boots McGee what's going on

889
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,480
there on YouTube since taking total

890
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,480
immune I haven't gotten sick and have

891
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,119
been traveling more than I have in my

892
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,119
entire life and guess what boots McGee

893
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,920
someone just recently told me that that

894
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,560
since they were taking total

895
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,079
immune same thing you guys know I work

896
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,359
with fmer vimer is the best stuff there

897
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:52,640
is hands down and I don't want it to go

898
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,200
away I don't want it to just go away

899
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
because you don't know what you got

900
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,920
until it's gone and people are going to

901
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,560
be sorry if it ever goes away

902
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,200
people are going to be sorry the people

903
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,400
that know are going to be sorry people

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,319
followed you for ages and just now it

1065
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:10,880
clicked thank

1066
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,760
you I have a lot to say about that by

1067
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,880
the way I'm not going to say it I I'm

1068
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,640
choosing not to say it right now I got a

1069
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,599
lot to say about

1070
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,240
that exactly you've been following me on

1071
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,319
IG but for some right reason can't see

1072
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,319
my Ig and yeah so are a lot of people

1073
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,720
right because it's strange how it works

1074
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,760
algorithms are so weird all right let's

1075
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,160
go so we got the shingles virus and

1076
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,720
inside the shingles virus you got a

1077
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:45,000
little bit of a nucleus okay

1078
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:52,119
right shingles

1079
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:56,640
virus has a really really toxic outer

1080
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,359
membran really highly toxic okay and

1081
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,160
with the shingles virus does is it

1082
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:04,079
releases a dermatoxin out of this

1083
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,240
membrane okay but that dermatoxin

1084
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,880
Shields the virus the reason why people

1085
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,520
suffer from the shingle so much is it's

1086
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,119
a hard bug to kill but you got to be

1087
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,400
smart about it got to be really smart

1088
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,240
about it you got to know information you

1089
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,160
have to know information see this book

1090
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:28,319
right here see now you see it now you

1091
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,240
don't see the book the shingle virus

1092
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,400
very very

1093
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:38,200
toxic outer layer and inside layer of a

1094
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,160
membrane right the nucleus produces a

Vegas okay get

1120
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:57,040

that your nerves get

1123
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,440
inflamed right there that's the shingles

1124
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,640
virus the nucleus producing dermatoxin

1125
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,839
the dermatoxin leaving the membrane

1126
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,640
going into the membrane the membrane

1127
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:16,319
becoming hot and toxic then spewing out

1128
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:20,440
the dermatoxin and then it hitting all

1129
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,920
your nerves your sciatic nerve yep your

1130
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,400
tibial nerve

1131
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,440
yep all the different nerves okay your

1132
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,520
trien

1133
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,400
nerve all of them so many different

1134
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,760
nerves your veg nerves your frenic

1135
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,839
nerves and what happens is those nerves

1136
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:44,400
get lit here's the problem that

1137
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:48,079
dermatoxin it stays on those

1138
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,480
nerves and then you just suffer in pain

1139
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,079
what we have to do is we have to kill

1140
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,440
the virus we have to kill the virus we

1141
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,640
have to strengthen our immune system

1142
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,000
and we need the maintenance to do that

1143
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,319
kind of stuff we need it to do that kind

1144
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,280
of stuff

1145
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:10,359
strengthen the immune cells so we can

1146
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:15,040
kill this virus and then over time the

1147
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:18,680
dermatoxin waxes and wains and it drops

1148
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,000
back and drops back and drops back and

1149
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,520
then you come out now you're rehabbing

1150
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,640
you're rehabbing and you're like oh my

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,400
the mattress you can feel a marble under

1179
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,559
the mattress right before falling asleep

1180
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,040
a lot of people you can hear the wind

1181
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,599
blow outside when you're falling asleep

1182
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,200
you can hear the floorboards Creak when

1183
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,079
you're falling asleep right you know you

1184
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,599
can hear your heartbeat how many people

1185
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,760
hear their heartbeat before they fall

1186
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,760
asleep they feel their pulse before they

1187
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,160
fall asleep right you can hear it in

1188
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,160
your ear a lot of people hear it in

1189
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,720
their ear as they're falling asleep and

1190
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,599
you're going to feel the itching come up

1191
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,359
on when you're falling asleep too that's

1192
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,359
one thing but yes at the same time our

1193
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,599
weakest point of time our immune system

1194
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,480
is is at the end of the day our immune

1195
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,280
system is at its weakest at the end of

1196
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,520
the day it's why when I'm always telling

1197
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,839
people to do the maintenance like

1198
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,559
friends and family and everything with

1199
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,119
the propolis and the cat's claw I'm like

1200
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,079
make sure you take some at the end of

1201
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,559
the day too make sure you take some at

1202
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,559
night before you go to bed because

1203
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,520
that's important because the weakest

1204
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,160
point in time where our immune cells are

1205
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,720
at their weakest is at the end of the

1206
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,799
day at at night and they're stronger in

1207
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,119
the morning after a little bit of rest

1208
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:34,520
even two hours of sleep 1 hour of sleep

1209
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,480
half an hour of sleep they get a Little

1210
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,079
Bit Stronger but at night at the end of

1211
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,200
the day they're at their weakest and

1212
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,280
yeah your viral flares could be edging

1213
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,040
up that could be making you itchy itchy

1214
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,839
too people itchy and all irritated and

1215
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,040
stuff and everything else but at the end

1216
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:51,640
of the day your immune system is at its

1217
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,680
weakest it's weaker keep in mind about

1218
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,599
that and so I tell like friends and

1219
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,400
family and I tell doctor friends make

1220
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,440

1221
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,040
you right you know your maintenance also

1222
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,400
at the end of the day make sure you're

1223
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,079
getting you know boom support for your

1224
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,720

talking about um lymphatic drainage I'm

1242
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,640
not against lymphatic massage or

1243
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,880
drainage I think it helps people I do

1244
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,359
I'm not against it at all I'm not

1245
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,680

incredible for people I'm not against

1247
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,920

1250
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,520
what's behind our lymphatic system the

1251
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,520
root cause and then you know that's

1252
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,240
that's a whole another thing so that's

1253
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,799
it it's about cleaning up the liver

1254
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,799
cleaning up the lymphatic system

1255
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,280

00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,720
here all right let's make a little bit

1275
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:08,720
of a lymphatic system

1276
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,240
here little bit of a lymphatic system

1277
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,240
you

1278
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,880
guys

1279
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,880
okay all

1280
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,040
right got a lymphatic

1281
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,119
system

1282
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:49,240
okay an incredible artist at

1283
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,000
hand there's an artist in in person here

1284
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,559
um so I want to talk about this right

1285
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,799
here so as you got fluid in your

1286
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,160
lymphatic

1287
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:58,119
system keep in mind that

1288
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,559
you got

1289
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:04,720
lymphocytes here

1290
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:08,200
lymphocytes they need to be fed your

1291
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,000
lymphocytes that are in your lymphatic

1292
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,680
system those lymphocytes

1293
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,319
devour pathogens in your lymphatic

1294
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,559
system keep that in mind right there if

1295
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:23,280
you don't address the

1296
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,799
liver and your lymphatic system is

1297
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:30,160
constantly dirty and clogged you're

1298
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:33,040
keeping your immune system weakened okay

1299
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:36,720
so yes I'm not against lymphatic

1300
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,559
drainage but what needs to be done is

1301
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,799
the core root cause of your lymphatic

1302
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,040
problems which is your liver being

1303
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:48,040
stagnant sluggish filled the toxins and

1304
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,000
poisons that's one thing and the other

1305
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,400
aspect of the immune system which is

1306
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,040
your

1307
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,720
lymphocytes no one's talking about

1308
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,319
lymphocytes they're talking about that

1309
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,280
part of your immune system which is

1310
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,640
critical right you still have to do

1311
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,000
maintenance and you still have to feed

1312
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,079
your lymphocytes if you don't feed them

1313
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,799
and they're

1314
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,880
weak they can't work for you and they

1315
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:13,359
can't catch pathogens and they can't

1316
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,480
catch

1317
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,440
poisons and if you're playing with your

1318
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,440
lymphatic system too much and you're and

1319
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,520
it's being manipulated and purged and

1320
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,599
squeezed your lymphocytes are having a

1321
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,799
hard time trying to to find balance in

1322
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,240
that they're being pushed

1323
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:34,400
around and they need their natural

1324
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,720
habitat to be slightly undisturbed in

1325
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,280
certain areas so when people go through

1326
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,319
the roof crazy with lymphatic

1327
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,799
drainage they're they're manipulating

1328
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:48,160
the habitat of the of the

1329
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:49,960
lymphocyte and that can weaken the

1330
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,760
lymphatic immune

1331
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:57,640
system so it there's a there's a there's

1332
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,920
a place where we can get massage and

1333
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,839
drainage lymphatic drainage gentle

1334
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,640
gentle drainage but there's also a fine

1335
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,079
line between if we do

1336
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,319
extremism with the lymphatic system and

1337
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,720
we

1338
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:15,720
weaken the lymphatic systems

1339
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,960
lymphocytic system all the time and

1340
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,599
we're trying to push fluid and push

1341
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,359
fluid and push fluid so we can a look

1342
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:34,400
better or feel better in a bikini or

1343
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:38,119
whatever it is if we're

1344
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,400
literally water boarding and literally

1345
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,280
crushing down on our lymphatic vessels

1346
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,640
and trying to squeeze every last bit of

1347
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:48,720
fluid out of them we just manipulated

1348
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,640
our lymphocytes and our immune cells

1349
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,440
which weakens our immune system so we

1350
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:58,000
have to be careful with how much

1351
00:56:53,440 --> 00:57:00,799
manipulation we do on on our lympo on on

1352
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,599
our lymphatic system so we can protect

1353
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,559
our

1354
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,880
lymphocytes what I'm trying to say is

1355
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,160
your lymphatic

1356
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,440
system your lymph your lymph system has

1357
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,520
the lymphocytes big part of your immune

1358
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:18,319
system but if we're beating the crap out

1359
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:21,119
of our lymphatic system just so we can

1360
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:23,400
push fluid around we are manipulating

1361
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,160
and pushing lymphocytes around and they

1362
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,920
take the hit and they get

1363
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:31,640
damaged so every time we get a lymphatic

1364
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:35,520
draining session like a really deep

1365
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,880
one our lymphocytes need time to recover

1366
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,920
and

1367
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,520
replenish and maybe even need time to

1368
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,720
restore because we can hinder our

1369
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,119
lymphocytes but I do still like

1370
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,079
lymphatic drainage especially if you're

1371
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:50,680
sary and you can't you can't move around

1372
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,799
I want people to still get it if they

1373
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:56,359
can I still want them to get

1374
00:57:52,799 --> 00:58:00,440
it but the fluid is there to protect the

1375
00:57:56,359 --> 00:58:02,839
lymphocyte too keep that in mind so if

1376
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,079
you're really toxic and you're trying to

1377
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:07,400
move toxins through your lymphatic fluid

1378
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,760
keep in mind that when we're moving

1379
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,480
those toxins around we're pushing our

1380
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,480
lymphocytes into those toxins manually

1381
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,920
we're

1382
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,599
manipulating our lymphatic systems

1383
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,400
immune system so we have to be careful

1384
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,520
to some degree so what I tell people a

1385
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,160
lot of people ask me like what do you

1386
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:27,119
think about lymphatic massage I say it's

1387
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:29,559
great just don't go extremism

1388
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,720
where you're doing it every day you're

1389
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:35,200
not giving your lymphocytes a chance to

1390
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:37,319
recovery build reestablish themselves

1391
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,640
and don't go so crazy where you have

1392
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:41,640
machines on you and you're trying to use

1393
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,079
the machines the vibrating machines

1394
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,760
where you're trying to literally get

1395
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,599
every little scrap of juice out of some

1396
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,640
of your lymphatic

1397
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,359
system we retain fluid in our lymphatic

1398
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,079
system to dilute the toxins so here

1399
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,760
people are actually trying to push our

1400
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,359
fluid out

1401
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,000
but toxins still stay behind and sludge

1402
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,960
still stays behind and what they're

1403
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,319
doing is they're trying to manually push

1404
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,400
out all the fluid but toxins are still

1405
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:10,920
staying behind so keep in mind that we

1406
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,559
do want some fluid left in our lymphatic

1407
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,599
system because I see people using a lot

1408
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,400
of tools and a lot of lymphatic

1409
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:20,359
machinery and I'm like oh dear Lord

1410
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,119
You're squeezing fluid out but a lot of

1411
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:24,319
sludge and toxins are staying behind

1412
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:25,839
without fluid anymore in there to

1413
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,280
actually protect you and your immune

1414
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,039
system system and you're also

1415
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,480
manipulating and pushing

1416
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:34,720
lymphatic lymphocyte cells out when you

1417
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,319
need them in there to protect you from

1418
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,720
pathogens and so forth the lymphocytes

1419
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:43,319
die quickly if it's too toxic in there

1420
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,160
but they die quickly if we're also

1421
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:48,359
manipulating them and grinding them into

1422
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,280
nothing because we're using so much

1423
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:52,400
manipulation with the lymphatic drainage

1424
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,359
Styles and techniques now it's not just

1425
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,799
what it used to be people are getting

1426
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:58,200
like obsessed and they're using machines

1427
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,960
and rollers and they're trying to

1428
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,599
squeeze every last bit of juice out of

1429
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,599
people I'm sure that's not probably what

1430
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,640
you're doing you might just be getting a

1431
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,200
normal lymphatic drainage session I

1432
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,240
think that's great I think it's

1433
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,280
supportive but we also have to work on

1434
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,599
the liver and we have to protect we have

1435
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,440
to at least feed our lymphocytes that's

1436
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:18,119
why I talk about the maintenance stuff

1437
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,799
with the propolis pure and the cats claw

1438
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,000
and and the total immune to feed our

1439
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,280
lymphocytes as well over there in IG

1440
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,559
ingred says what's the brand for the

1441
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,280
propolis and the cats clots vimergy V is

1442
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:33,480
in Victor i m is in Mary E RG

1443
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,960
y.com link is in the description I think

1444
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,200
and all that so you

1445
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,000
guys Incredible One Day at a Time keep

1446
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:44,079
up all your healing but this is another

1447
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
you know another show about the immune

1448
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,680
system learning all these different

1449
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,480
things about the immune system very

1450
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,640
important because we can forget take it

1451
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,039
for granted not realize what's going on

1452
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,400
we lose we lose our Direction and then

1453
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,000
we're sick and we stay sick for years

1454
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,799
and we're confused and we're just

1455
