The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,680
it's time to get answers welcome to the

William hey everybody we're talking

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,960

it's always about protecting our health

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,200
in every way possible and chemtrails

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,720
that's an area we have to cover I have

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,320
to give you guys a little warning though

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,280
after you hear this you may never see

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,640
the sky the same

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,400
again this is all information from

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,000
Spirit of compassion since I was a child

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,320
naysayers they can believe it or not

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,600
that's fine maybe somebody can call it a

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,360
Theory look we can call it a spooky

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,560
Campfire story if it makes people feel

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,240
good we can do that too that's fine but

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,200
hey when you hear what I have to say

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
just get ready bottom line you've

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
probably done your research with

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,200
Chemtrails somebody has somebody must

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,840
have because there's people out there

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,079
they're like Chemtrails I know about

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,439
those and I've heard about those and

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,719
there's some information out there and

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
yeah some of it's accurate one of the

42
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,320
accurate parts of chemtrails is that

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,799
they there are chemtrails that there

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,119
actually are chemtrails so I'm going to

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,080
tell you guys what information isn't out

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,879
there and it's a lot What Spirit of

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,480
compassion has told me the Deep secrets

48
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,560
of the chemtrail game yeah did you hear

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,000
that I said game yeah a sick game my

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,560
first experience with Chemtrails was as

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,560
a child and a friend of mine pointing

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,360
out a contrail on the horizon and my

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,440
friend asking what does your spirit say

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,599
about this

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,959
contrail and that's what he said I said

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,080
well let me ask Spirit of compassion

57
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,040
what is a

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,239
contrail and spirit of compassion said

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,080
there are

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:51,159
contrails and there are man-made poison

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Trails where man is poisoning man these

62
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,680
are two entirely different

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,200
things ever since then I was intrigued

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,480
in fact I was obsessed about doubted why

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,959
on Earth would man be poisoning man that

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,959
right there when I was young I I I it

67
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,440
was overload it was

68
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,360
overload why on Earth would man be

69
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,680
dumping poison on man that was hard for

70
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,879
me to receive as a child because that

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,080
one right there just it didn't make

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,239
sense and even though Spirit of

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,120
compassion delivered me the harsh

74
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,519
reality of chronic illness already as a

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,480
young child teaching me so many of the

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,159
things things that that I've lectured

77
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,439
about over the years that people know

78
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,560
about now that has been passed around

79
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,080
because the health scene was so small

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,159
for years ago and all the information

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,879
that got out there that was so like

82
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,720
harsh reality of why women are sick and

83
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,840
why men are sick this was a hard one for

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
me it was a hard one when I receiv

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
received this as a child I mean I knew

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,239
about rat poison I knew about rat poison

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,200
that kills rats right rat poison I was

88
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,040
afraid of of it I was afraid of rat

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,000
poison you just don't want to play with

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,400
that stuff I knew about insect poisoning

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,159
too my neighbors they sprayed out of a

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,200
can so this prompted me to constantly

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,519
ask Spirit of compassion what's that

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,239
Mark in the Sky What's that plane what

95
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,360
is that streak in the sky what is what

96
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,919
is this and spirit would say that's a

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,600
passenger plane that's what that is

98
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,759
that's a passenger plane and that's a

99
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
cargo plane there i' be like oh what's

100
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,720
that plane you know a couple hours later

101
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,960
what is that one you know well that's a

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,039
third type of plane you got your

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,320
passenger planes where people are on

104
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,960
them you got your cargo planes where

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,800
they're delivering packages and

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
everything else right and all that and

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,400
there's other little tiny planes you

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,639
know that fly around or private planes

109
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,759
little ones and all that but big planes

110
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm talking about big ones and there

111
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,560
then there was this third plane

112
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,080
and we'll get to that in a little bit

113
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,720
about that third plane now there is a

114
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,919
big difference between a contrail and

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,759
what people have named now a

116
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,240
chemrail so hey I learned it as manmade

117
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,600
poison Trails that's what Spirit of

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,720
compassion said and now I guess they're

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,280
called Chemtrails and it's a good name

120
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,479
for them too I like that name I do

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,240
contrails contrails are fuel burning and

122
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,240
heat exchanging from a plane it's this

123
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,600
heat coming out of engines okay so when

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,240
you're entering a higher altitude and

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,639
you got that fuel burning emitting all

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,520
of that different vapor and that air is

127
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,639
cool as that plane is rising and you you

128
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,560
can see these contrails out there yeah

129
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,240
there's this little tiny streak and you

130
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,000
see mostly contrails in the fall

131
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,880
contrails in the winter on the horizon

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,440
of the night sky right on the other hand

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,080
a chemtrail is something sinister

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,240
something dark something dark in a

135
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,599
Despicable way that's even

136
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,800
unimaginable really is it was for me as

137
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,599
a child and before I tell you what

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,520
Spirit of compassion has told me about

139
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,639
the

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,160
Chemtrails I got to bring you back into

141
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,800
history a little bit to World War I

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,240
1914 okay and the world was at war and a

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
few years before the world was at War a

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,919
few years in the early 1900s the

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
chemical industry was

146
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,840
birthing it was birthing they were

147
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,520
experimenting with chemical

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,560
concoctions it was a brand new industry

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,400
and fierce at that for industrial use

150
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,440
World War I was the money and the fuel

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,080
for the chemical industry to become

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,720
larger to ignite to propel it was like

153
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,160
the it was like the gasoline on the fire

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,240
that war for the for the chemical

155
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
industry so it became larger because the

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,000
chemical industry was contracted to feed

157
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,639
the War Industry the global War Industry

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,160
they were hired to produce chemicals for

159
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,440
chemical warfare and all kinds of other

160
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Industries about war and this was all

161
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,160
around the world and a surplus of these

162
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,759
chemicals were stockpiled storage bins

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,520
of these chemicals the chemical industry

164
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,360
loves War they love insects too now they

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,240
love rodents they love machines they

166
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,120
love anything and they loved all that

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,759
back then and everything that they

168
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,080
believe needs a chemical you might be

169
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,680
wondering like why is he talking about

170
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,120
World War I yeah yeah I got a real

171
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,639
reason and it's a powerful reason to

172
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,080
just hang on and when I tell you guys

173
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,039
fasten your seat belts like I have in

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,000
the past you're going to want to fasten

175
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,120
your seat bels for this one I mean you

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,159
really are I I would be sitting down for

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,680
this show but the war ended early with

178
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,080
the help of the Spanish flu right you

179
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,960
guys probably know that information

180
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,240
there the flu kind of knocked that war

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,159
down but hey that disappointed the

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,159
chemical Industries they were hoping the

183
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,759
war would last forever but you didn't

184
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,639
need a war lasting forever for them this

185
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,360
was the true birth of the chemical

186
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,720
Industries and it spawned on the birth

187
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,279
of all chemicals used in all industri it

188
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,479
led to constant production of industrial

189
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,240
chemicals all the way to World War II

190
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,959
Not only was the chemical industry

191
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,800
producing for World War II now but they

192
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,600
were producing on a much larger scale

193
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,000
for almost all Industries around the

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,440
world everywhere at that point because

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,800
of this there was so much overflow of

196
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,600
byproduct the industries had to dump

197
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,480
some of the chemicals into rivers lakes

198
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,519
in the ocean and I'm going to talk about

199
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,320
byproduct in a minute what that means

200
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,600
byproduct coming off of creating a

201
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,600
chemical not just the chemical

202
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,839
itself the industries they just dumped

203
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
it right into rivers they dumped them

204
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
into lakes they dumped them into the

205
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,560
ocean they dumped them everywhere they

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,920
were they were already doing that since

207
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,640
the early 1900s they were already

208
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,480
dumping all this stuff everywhere but it

209
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,760
was increasing greatly and with more

210
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,839
dangerous

211
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,920
concoctions the chemical Industries knew

212
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,360
if it persisted

213
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,399
our lakes and rivers would

214
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,760
die they would die and they would die

215
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,760
globally and they knew this just like

216
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,240
Lake Erie almost was pronounced

217
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,000
dead almost pronounced completely dead

218
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
and when it gets to that point when a

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
lake actually completely dies you can't

220
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,560
bring it back so The Dumping of these

221
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,440
chemicals slowed down in the 1960s and

222
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,079
storage bins and storage bins started to

223
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,959
accumulate more and more and more around

224
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,040
the world storage bins of chemicals you

225
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,880
have to understand something this is

226
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,640
important the process of making

227
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,839
chemicals is a wasteful process in order

228
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,880
to make a chemical for a use there's

229
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,760
trial and error they experiment over and

230
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,640
over and over again and create bad

231
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,560
batches they create mistakes nonstop

232
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,720
it's practice is what it is it's

233
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,040
practiced mistakes

234
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,839
that have to be discarded where does all

235
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,920
that practiced mistake go millions and

236
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,720
millions and billions of botch jobed

237
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,360
gallons have to go somewhere of chemical

238
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,240
so not only do you have the mistakes

239
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,800
made as they try to discover a chemical

240
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,680
for use but the byproduct produced is a

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,360
whole other level of waste which can

242
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,040
lead to millions of gallons on its own

243
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,800
hey this might be boring when you think

244
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,079
about it to somebody they're like I

245
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,120
don't want to hear about chemicals oh

246
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,360
yeah you don't you don't okay you don't

247
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,279
want to hear about them okay all right

248
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,680
okay you okay you live in that world but

249
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,560
you know

250
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,360
what you want to know you want to know

251
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,920
what's happening because it involves you

252
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,360
it involves everybody this isn't just a

253
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,519
story about some chemicals or something

254
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,720
this this is critical information so you

255
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
can protect your family so you can

256
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,880
protect your loved ones and protect

257
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,639
yourself the byproduct I'm talking about

258
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,600
produced that's a whole another level of

259
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,360
waste it's not just the chemical that's

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
being produced but the byproduct which

261
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,560
can lead to once again millions and

262
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,440
millions and billions of gallons on its

263
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,880
own per one

264
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,240
chemical now per one chemical they try

265
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,000
to deem useful this can mean up to a

266
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,720
thousand times the byproduct per

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,839
chemical produced it could up to that

268
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,959
this translates to trillions and

269
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,360
trillions of gallons of byproduct over

270
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:11,240
the years what's byproduct deadly waste

271
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,480
chemicals you know from a chemical when

272
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,720
they're trying to make it that was a

273
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,959
method of disposing of the toxic waste

274
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,880
the method was throw it in Rivers throw

275
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:26,360
it in Lakes let it drain into lakes let

276
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,519
it drain in the ocean but where's it

277
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,279
going to go you know in the end with all

278
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,360
of that trillions of gallons where is

279
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,079
the industry going to store all of those

280
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,440
toxic gallons because they back down on

281
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,199
dumping it in any streams rivers and

282
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,880
lakes and and the ocean back in the 60s

283
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,600
it was back down and where do you store

284
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,120
all that because it's going to take up

285
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,560
so much land in the world so much land

286
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,399
in the world massive amounts the old

287
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,880
method was to dump it like I said in our

288
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,199
rivers and lakes and the other old

289
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,680
method was to dump in landfills and

290
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,880
toxic dump sites where then the rain

291
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,040
would come and the rain would slowly

292
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,279
wash small amounts of it back into the

293
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,480
ocean back into the rivers and back into

294
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,320
the Lakes this has been ongoing since

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,399
the early 1900s it was the older method

296
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm talking about to discard it and get

297
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,720
rid of it but you'll see why I'm talking

298
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,399
about this as we move along the global

299
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,040
chemic you know chemical Industries had

300
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,480
a problem on their hands they couldn't

301
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
dump it all in the rivers oceans and

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,760
lakes not all of it and there was

303
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,959
nowhere to store the mass amounts

304
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,279
anymore there wasn't enough land

305
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,600
available to store the surplus of

306
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,800
chemicals and the excess byproduct it

307
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,320
would take over planet Earth we're

308
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,040
talking about levels that are so huge

309
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,759
and so massive Unthinkable levels and

310
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,279
amounts and different kinds of chemicals

311
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,399
thousands of different kinds of

312
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,800
chemicals and their byproducts before we

313
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,680
go further though we will talk about

314
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,720
those planes we see in the air so now

315
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
there's airliners right hey they have

316
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
passengers you guys have been on those

317
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,480
planes before they got passengers you're

318
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,079
flying all flying up there and then

319
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,240
there's cargo planes and they might have

320
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,040
a couple of P passengers on there but

321
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,800
they have you know packages and

322
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,639
shipments and carrying packages all

323
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,839
around the globe

324
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,000
but there's another kind of large plane

325
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,839
up there Spirit of compassion told me

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,360
about it it's separate from the other

327
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,199
two kinds of planes I just mentioned

328
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,440
these are older

329
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,639
airliners they're older airliners these

330
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,720
airliners are from the late 50s and the

331
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:56,000
60s and the 70s and the 80s and the '90s

332
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,920
these different kind of planes people

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,920
used to travel in them yeah airliners is

334
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,040
what they were but not anymore they fly

335
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,000
with no passengers on there anymore

336
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,120
those days are over they travel on their

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,440
own flight patterns and they land in

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,519
private airports their own private

339
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,680
airports these private airports aren't

340
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,079
military they have nothing to do with

341
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,839
any world

342
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,519
military and you know what's really

343
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,600
weird they have nothing to do with any

344
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,920
world

345
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
governments it's a whole other

346
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,519
organization

347
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,680
built for the chemical

348
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,720
Industries

349
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,000
and I should have my flashl shining on

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,600
my face right now as we sit around the

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,319
campfire you know get ready for the

352
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,480
information though and a whole other

353
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,279
organization of private contractors

354
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,440
built this for the chemical

355
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,759
Industries I always tell you guys about

356
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,319
the private deals that Spirit of

357
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,240
compassion has told me about all through

358
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,600
the years I tell you about the private

359
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,759
deals going on here's just another one

360
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,319
to add to the list right a private deal

361
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,959
that was put in place in the

362
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:11,040
1960s made without anybody's say or

363
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,519
input no Town Hall meetings like always

364
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,800
say it's kind of reminds me of the just

365
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,240
like just like the protein law hey if

366
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
you're new to Medical medium information

367
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
you be like what's the protein law well

368
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,240
the protein law is something you've been

369
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,399
brainwashed with okay just so you know

370
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
all right back in the early

371
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,279
1930s the the whole thing about protein

372
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,759
was purposely done and it was in it was

373
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,279
put into schools and all of this

374
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,639
information about I can give you that

375
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,040
another day you're going to hear about

376
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,880
the protein law and you'll know why

377
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,399
you've been brainwashed by the protein

378
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,560
law but and then there's the autoimmune

379
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,959
law too where we've been trained that

380
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,600
our bodies attack themselves that we're

381
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,279
taught that our body turns against our

382
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,680
glands and organs and our body's immune

383
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
system destroys itself right the

384
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,800
autoimmune law that started in the 1950s

385
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,959
that private deal that was made that

386
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
everybody's brainwashed about to

387
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,519
alternative medicine and conventional

388
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,399
medicine well we'll talk about those in

389
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,120
future episodes but this was another

390
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,480
private deal that was made these old

391
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,439
planes were hollowed out tanks were put

392
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,120
inside of them and not the tanks that

393
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,679
are theorized now not the tanks they cuz

394
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,799
you know people talk about there must be

395
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,480
tanks in these planes right but these

396
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,480
tanks are large tanks not little tiny

397
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,640
ones they're large tanks and the these

398
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,679
planes are gutted and these large

399
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,799
plastic tanks are installed the tanks

400
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,240
were filled with old chemicals and their

401
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:42,360
byproducts that's what happens so the

402
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,280
plane is sitting there a truck comes by

403
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,720
and then fills the plane up with these

404
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,200
toxic waste

405
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,120
chemicals that's how the system works

406
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,280
the planes land once they empty the

407
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,640
chemicals they land they're in the

408
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,240
airport trucks come by they fill up the

409
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,720
tanks planes take off it's and they they

410
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,799
go out and they're just they're up in

411
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,880
the air again so the global chemical

412
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,720
industry was was harboring for over 50

413
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,440
years since before the 1960s all these

414
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,640
toxic chemicals that that they've been

415
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,679
holding on to because if they dumped

416
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,200
everything in the rivers and the lakes

417
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,080
and the ocean at once and in landfills

418
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,600
throughout the throughout the whole

419
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,600
1900s and early 1900s it would have been

420
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,640
epic disaster an epic disaster so many

421
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,360
of the chemicals were held on to and

422
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,080
kept in store Vats the plan was to fill

423
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,600
these planes with these chemicals and

424
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,520
release them when the planes are up in

425
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,679
the sky you know is that a nice thing to

426
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,640
do I don't think so the planes go high

427
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:51,760
in the sky and they release these toxic

428
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,720
chemicals so it would slowly thin out

429
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,240
over time as these chemicals

430
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,760
dissipated this isn't in just one

431
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,280
country okay okay so if you're thinking

432
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,880
that in your mind you're like whoa what

433
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,120
country he's talking about no no a

434
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,200
global

435
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:14,280
phenomenon a global deal the planes are

436
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,799
flying all over the entire planet

437
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,480
dropping down these chemicals and

438
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,200
chemical

439
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,600
byproduct these old storage Vats of

440
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,840
chemicals that all these chemical

441
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,039
Industries had sitting around too too

442
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,559
long something happens to these

443
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,440
chemicals when they sit around too too

444
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:40,559
long on another note things grow inside

445
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:45,280
of them strange forms of bacteria

446
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,799
strange forms of mold fungus toxic algae

447
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,520
and that's something you got to remember

448
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,320
as we go through the show toxic algae

449
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,520
interesting you know like red tide kind

450
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,240
of stuff we're going to keep on moving

451
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,679
along new allergens we never even

452
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,200
experience grow in these

453
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,559
tanks this is why the oceans get those

454
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,240
algae blooms that actually cause the red

455
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,440
tide by the way these red tides are a

456
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,280
sign of the coming times down down down

457
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,559
the road okay and you know long after

458
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,880
we're here but these coming times where

459
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,000
the oceans die and turn completely red

460
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,919
you know the chemicals are

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,320
producing the over production of the

462
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,400
toxic algae that's what happens the

463
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,360
chemicals that are being dropped out of

464
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,440
the sky are igniting and proliferating

465
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,799
toxic

466
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,280
algae because that's where the toxic

467
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,280
algae are coming from see we kind of

468
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,320
play stupid down here we're like testing

469
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,919
water we're testing red tide certain

470
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,960
times of the Season hey it's dangerous

471
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,799
to go in the water don't go in that

472
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,120
water right now you might get sick you

473
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,640
know we're doing little tests on it but

474
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,000
that toxic algae comes from someplace it

475
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,200
didn't come come from down here that

476
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,679
toxic algae came from up there and

477
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,760
rained

478
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,640
down that's how it works see you get

479
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,840
microorganisms they have to survive they

480
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
need to survive and when they sit in

481
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,320
these chemical soups in Vats and storage

482
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,320
bins for years and decades they adapt

483
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:28,720
the more microorganisms then breed life

484
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,640
in there and then they have to adapt to

485
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,120
survive and that's going to be a whole

486
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,120
story for another day on know how that

487
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,679
works but let's just keep

488
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,320
going but what you see is not what you

489
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,279
get up there in the sky when you look at

490
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,159
the Chemtrails in the sky you might be

491
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,919
thinking oh wow that chemtrail now he's

492
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,880
talking about that chem trol is going to

493
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,600
fall on me I see that one right up there

494
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,000
that one's going to fall on me hey look

495
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,520
there's another one right there hey look

496
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,480
there's 10 over there those guy those

497
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,840
chem trolls are going to hit me now no

498
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
this is a good piece of information to

499
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,159
know know the Chemtrails you see are not

500
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,679
coming down on you they're not if you

501
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,159
can see it it's not coming down on you

502
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,960
they're coming down on somebody else

503
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,919
miles away the chemtrail that comes down

504
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,880
in you you can't see it's already come

505
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:18,480
down it's already been heading down and

506
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,320
comes down they float through the sky

507
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,000
and they dissipate and they drop miles

508
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,320
after miles after miles and they fall

509
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,799
down on somebody else the ones you see

510
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,400
in the sky anyway so the planes they

511
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,840
drop these chemical soups all day all

512
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:39,159
night non-stop but non-stop all night

513
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,120
all day all night all day chemical

514
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,159
byproducts are forever being produced by

515
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,880
the chemical industry if you're

516
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
wondering what byproduct I'm talking

517
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,600
about it's endless really I mean it's

518
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,400
endless so many things that are man-made

519
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,080
out there they prod everything man-made

520
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,120
produces chemical

521
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,960
byproduct from many Industries including

522
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,799
the petrochemical Industries throughout

523
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,960
the world the entire world the byproduct

524
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,679
is highly toxic and it can't be dumped

525
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,360
in the ocean like I said in one shot you

526
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,559
dump all this in the ocean in one shot

527
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,640
shot you guys and the ocean's dead

528
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,200
that's it every the whales die

529
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,720
everything dies that would happen you

530
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,760
dump all this stuff if all the if the

531
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,080
chemical industry opened up the

532
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,400
floodgates and let everything roll into

533
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,279
the ocean at once all their backlog

534
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,240
their trillions of gallons the ocean

535
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:34,360
would die and one shot and turn deep red

536
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,240
blood red and every single dolphin would

537
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,279
die you know a fraction of this

538
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,120
byproduct just a fraction of this

539
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,960
byproduct I'm talking about sent down a

540
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,559
major river would kill the entire River

541
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,159
and all the foliage and plant life

542
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,360
within the river and around

543
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,039
it it has to be dropped

544
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,279
strategically the chemicals have to be

545
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,400
dropped

546
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,240
strategically out of ples in our

547
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,400
atmosphere to thin out and spaced out

548
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,679
enough so it doesn't show the immediate

549
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,159
harm on our environment and

550
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:15,240
nature Spirit of compassion says to me

551
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,679
and always has the plan is as you drop

552
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,679
it slowly Spirit of compassion told me

553
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,840
as you drop it slowly out of the sky it

554
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,240
gives our oceans rivers and lakes and

555
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,520
forests time to

556
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,799
adapt I always that always blew my mind

557
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,600
Spirit of compassion would say it

558
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:36,360
lessens the shock on the environment it

559
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,600
gives everything a chance to

560
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,760
adapt and that was wild to me that was

561
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,360
wild the other plan was for some of it

562
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,200
to stay in the clouds intermix with

563
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,120
precipitation and becom somewhat

564
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,120
diffused by The Living Water that's rain

565
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:59,039
rain's rain's electric it's electric

566
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,200
that's what rain is it's got a charge to

567
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,279
it and that living water that charge

568
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,720
that was that was part of the plan that

569
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:10,919
it could diffuse some of it so the plan

570
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,640
was hopefully it stays in a lot of

571
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:19,600
clouds you've heard about acid rain

572
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,840
right acid rain H you know the thing

573
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,520
that everybody says smog is the culprit

574
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,520
for but there's much more than that it's

575
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,240
much more than just

576
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,840
smog it's it's a lot to do with the

577
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,000
Chemtrails because the Chemtrails a lot

578
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,480
of it a decent amount of it does stay up

579
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,039
there and it eventually comes down in

580
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,840
the

581
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:43,440
rain I talked about rain being toxic and

582
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,919
you don't want if you're somebody that's

583
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
sick and you got symptoms and you're

584
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,360
hypers sensitive you don't want to be

585
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,000
drenched by the rain all the time

586
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,480
because he might feel a little sick and

587
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,200
a little sicker along the way you know

588
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,919
look

589
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:04,279
Chemtrails is why our skies aren't blue

590
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:07,200
anymore okay and they're hazy blue the

591
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:10,159
chemicals that stay in the air and hover

592
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,159
before they even drop change the color

593
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,640
color of our Sky look you might be

594
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,159
somebody that's young and when you're

595
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,240
young you just think this guy is as blue

596
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,080
as it is and that's it but when you talk

597
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,120
to older people like older people

598
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,320
they're like they know what a deep blue

599
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,480
sky looks like

600
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,960
you know photographs from our skies you

601
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,440
guys in the 1940s and the 1950s and

602
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,840
early 1960s are vastly different than

603
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,760
are photographs today of a sky unless

604
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,520
you put filters on them and photoshoop

605
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,120
them and change the colors with your

606
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,640
computer right what a game that is

607
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,559
unbelievable hiding the sky we mostly

608
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,399
have Misty baby blue skies now not rich

609
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:02,559
Clear Blue Skies we have become the frog

610
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:05,760
in a pot of boiling water in some

611
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,679
respects each new generation doesn't

612
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,240
know how rich and clear and blue the sky

613
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:16,159
was in the past you are born and raised

614
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,640
with the new Sky we have which is all

615
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,320
you know just like the frog doesn't know

616
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,360
the temperature of the water is getting

617
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,679
hot until it's too late we don't know

618
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,679
the skies are becoming less

619
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,360
blue when the chemtrails accumulate they

620
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,039
Shadow areas of the world wreaking havoc

621
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,799
on Epic levels because of the drowning

622
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,960
out of our

623
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,679
sun it changes the weather it does

624
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,080
interesting it changes the weather our

625
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,320
weather has changed our climate has

626
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,519
changed because of chem

627
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,399
trails and I'm not talking about the

628
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,760
cloud seeding trail that is known or the

629
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,760
cloud seeding technique that is known

630
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,919
where they use barium and other

631
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,200
substances to manipulate

632
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,519
precipitation Chemtrails is a whole

633
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
other thing going on it's separate from

634
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,840
cloud

635
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,120
seeding that's a whole another point to

636
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,039
know the Chemtrails they cause droughts

637
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,360
in places that shouldn't have droughts

638
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,080
they can cause more rain in areas it

639
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,960
shouldn't Chemtrails interferes with

640
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,200
weather patterns because the chemicals

641
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,559
Harbor metals and metals interfere with

642
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,840
electrical activities of our skies

643
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,000
because our skies are electrical it

644
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,679
creates storms where storms shouldn't be

645
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,480
created it even manipulates hurricanes

646
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:41,279
Cyclones and tornadoes but even worse

647
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,320
our polar caps are melting because of

648
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,519
chemtrails I don't think you guys saw

649
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,840
that one coming right because I know

650
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,559
there's a lot of polar cap people that

651
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,880
are worried and you're just like oh my

652
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,679
God the polar caps are melting there's a

653
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,320
lot of people out there like I can ask

654
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,760
that I get asked all kinds of questions

655
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,399
I got friends that ask me questions all

656
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,039
through the years I mean you wouldn't

657
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,320
believe what people ask me when when

658
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,640
they know me they'll be like look tell

659
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,919
me tell me the hard truth about

660
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,720
something I'll be like what

661
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,200
what and the polar caps yeah and it

662
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,840
causes the waters to rise yeah is the

663
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,360
waters Rising yeah they're Rising ever

664
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,039
so slow slowly but they're Rising but

665
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,039
the Chemtrails are the true reason why

666
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,000
the waters are rising at all not the

667
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,880
fake reason which is just smug and

668
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,440
animal pollution and people pollution

669
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,880
those are bad don't get me wrong smog is

670
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,480
terrible pollution's bad but they're

671
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,840
nothing like chemtrails

672
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,120
here's the the strange thing about

673
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,559
Chemtrails governments have nothing to

674
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,360
do with Chemtrails World governments all

675
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,600
around all around the planet have

676
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,559
nothing to do with the Chemtrails how

677
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,360
weird is that and they have no power to

678
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,120
stop them either or even understand them

679
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,679
it's a private

680
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,159
club and the power behind this club is

681
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,559
like no other governments have to

682
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:53,799
pretend it's not happening like they

683
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,760
just whistle

684
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,120
like no that's not happening nope nope I

685
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,679
don't see you know I don't see any

686
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,159
trails in this guy I don't know what

687
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:06,480
that is they got to pretend it doesn't

688
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,120
exist you know what's funny too is it

689
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,679
makes the pharmaceutical industry look

690
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,880
like friendly happy and

691
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,640
safe makes big Pharma look like awesome

692
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,679
just like they've never done wrong they

693
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,720
can't do wrong big farm is like

694
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,320
incredible they can't do no wrong ever

695
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,120
with anything you know how do you solve

696
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,159
a problem that no one really knows about

697
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,200
how do you solve a problem that is above

698
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,799
all

699
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,279
laws how do you solve a problem that's

700
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,039
Global I can't solve the problem I can't

701
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:42,159
get people off of

702
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,840
eggs I can't get people off of eggs eggs

703
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,480
that are feeding the viruses that are

704
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,399
responsible for chronic fatigue and all

705
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,399
their other symptoms and conditions you

706
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,559
know eggs being one of the things that

707
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,760
actually feed bugs and then the bugs are

708
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,720
responsible these viruses are

709
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,919
responsible so I can't get people off of

710
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,120
eggs I can't can't get people off of

711
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,960
nutritional yeast all that MSG they

712
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,679
don't know they're eating so I know I

713
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,200
can't solve this problem I can't Spirit

714
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,600
of compassion told me when I was young

715
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,919
that the man poison

716
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Club is an evil

717
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,600
machine from what I learned from Spirit

718
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,000
of compassion you don't stop it and you

719
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,120
don't fight it cuz you'll never

720
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,639
win at least not that

721
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,799
way you have to accept it and then you

722
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:31,960
rise above it Spirit of compassion told

723
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,760
me you rise above it why am I talking

724
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,440
about this now you know and I waited for

725
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,200
years well you know I'm always focused

726
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,639
on you guys with chronic illness and all

727
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,639
the symptoms and conditions and hundreds

728
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,039
of symptoms and conditions that medical

729
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,399
medium information has reversed and

730
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,000
saved lives for so many years and then

731
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:51,080
the Advanced Medical information

732
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,799
Alternative Health that that that Spirit

733
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,679
of compassion put out there for years A

734
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,240
lot of it that goes right back to me

735
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,720
some of it that got lost in the wood

736
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,679
work out there and people use little

737
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,519
tidbits from Spirit of compassion and

738
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,840
don't even know where it comes from but

739
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,120
out of all that you know I'm always

740
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,240
focused on getting you guys better and

741
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,279
well I waited for years for somebody

742
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,919
else to discover what was really going

743
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,519
on and it's kind of that thing where I

744
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,360
bring out all those hard truths about

745
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,039
the caffeine industry and I bring out

746
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,720
the truth about autoimmune and I bring

747
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,039
out the truth about how to heal in the

748
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,000
viruses and what viruses and how they

749
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,279
been have how they've been let out in

750
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,519
our environment all these decades and

751
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,919
why people are sick with chronic

752
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,519
symptoms and conditions I bring out all

753
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,360
these truths that no one brings out in

754
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,760
alternative movement on any

755
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,559
level or conventional movement on any

756
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,960
level I'm busy with all that so I just

757
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,760
kind of sat back and I'm like you know

758
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,600
what I mean someone's got to figure this

759
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,519
out I I can't do it

760
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,159
all I can't do it all I can't just I

761
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,960
mean I have so much on my plate to

762
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,519
deliver out there so you would think by

763
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,760
now someone could have had figured it

764
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,480
out or what's really going on but it's

765
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,679
above anything we understand so I

766
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,120
understand why they have haven't I mean

767
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,240
look I have to get the information from

768
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,799
Spirit of

769
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,440
compassion and look if you're an asay or

770
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,880
somebody call it a theory if you want if

771
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,440
that makes you feel good if somebody

772
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,480
else call it make believe if you want if

773
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,120
it makes you feel good whatever whatever

774
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,279
works but here's the

775
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,159
problem it's going to get worse and

776
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,840
worse and worse over time the amount of

777
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,240
planes that have been increased just in

778
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,559
the last 30 years is

779
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,080
remarkable remarkable The Fleets are

780
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,600
Mass and growing larger and they run all

781
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,200
day and all night and they never stop

782
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,559
that's how much

783
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,440
chemical is being poured on

784
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,000
everyone in the future you won't really

785
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,159
see a video on any reality TV show or a

786
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,080
video or photograph on someone's social

787
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:53,480
media page with a sky free of

788
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,840
chemtrails contrails don't leave a Long

789
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,960
Trail they dissipate fast and it only

790
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,000
extends the small distance from the jet

791
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:05,440
engines Chemtrails go for a long long

792
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,159
way they can go for miles and miles as

793
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,040
the planes are flying the pilot slips a

794
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,960
he flips a

795
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,960
switch so that's what happens there's

796
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,399
this pilot on the plane he's got a

797
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,119
switch to his side and he clicks the

798
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:20,919
button he just he's he flips the switch

799
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,359
and then the pump goes on so there's a

800
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,679
pump going to the tanks and so the pump

801
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:28,599
turns on and it pumps the stuff out of

802
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,599
the tanks the chemicals out of the tanks

803
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,040
while the plane is flying and then

804
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,320
spouts on the side of the plane that are

805
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,359
bolted to the sides of the plane because

806
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,280
they're fabricated and built that way

807
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,240
and these these these jets these spout

808
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Jets on the side of the plane release

809
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,040
the chemical as the pump is pumping it

810
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,000
out of the big tanks and

811
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,879
then and then the chemical comes

812
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,599
shooting out of the spouts attached to

813
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,000
the plane sometimes you'll see a trail

814
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:02,240
go on for Miles right and and then it'll

815
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,280
stop 10 Mi later you'll see the It Go On

816
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,920
Again meaning you'll see the trail start

817
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,160
again the pilot is actually switching a

818
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,040
switch on and

819
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,520
off at the Pilot's own discretion some

820
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,760
Pilots go 20 miles before they switch it

821
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,680
on and off no Rhyme or Reason in many

822
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,760
cases it depends on what mood the

823
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,119
Pilot's in or maybe the Pilot's new to

824
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,040
it all it's first time on the job and he

825
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,920
releases it all at once and then lands

826
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,400
empty the the Pilot's job is to spread

827
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,079
it on and off through the whole duration

828
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,640
of that flight people who are aware of

829
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,480
chemrail think that it comes out of the

830
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,240
engines like they think that's must be

831
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,280
where the trail is coming from it

832
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,280
doesn't come out of the engines that's

833
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,599
not the fuel burning that's not what

834
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,240
that is Spirit of compassion fills me in

835
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,079
on these techniques and look you can

836
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,359
witness some of this yourself if if you

837
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,480
pay attention and you look up at the sky

838
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,440
but I know a lot of people they're

839
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,920
they're a little too busy and they're

840
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,880
not looking at the sky at all what's

841
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,880
interesting about Chemtrails is that the

842
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,599
activity of chemtrails is heightened in

843
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,839
areas where people will be outside more

844
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,839
you know during holidays and Gatherings

845
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,720
and vacation times of the year or when

846
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,480
people are just outside more when the

847
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,960
weather's really good and that's when

848
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,440
more activities happening not because

849
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,359
people are there and they're seeing it

850
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,839
not at all and that's not it but way

851
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,800
more activity more Chemtrails are being

852
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,280
dropped everywhere covering Skies when

853
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,160
people are out

854
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,119
more it's gone beyond the process of

855
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,240
getting rid of just chemicals and

856
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,960
byproduct um spirit and compassion

857
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,839
filled me in that there might have been

858
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,319
maybe the first intention originally

859
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,359
which is get rid of the byproduct get

860
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:55,680
rid of the

861
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,240
chemicals that was the safest way

862
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,000
someone thought the problem could be

863
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,119
dealt with and you know what maybe there

864
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,040
was a little bit of Innocence originally

865
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,640
with the problem maybe at the very

866
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,079
beginning in the 60s someone was worried

867
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,160
about dumping everything directly in the

868
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,680
Lakes because the demand the chemical

869
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,440
industry was so you know strong and they

870
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,560
were thinking maybe this was the best

871
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,960
idea as you put it up in planes and you

872
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,119
slowly drop it out and maybe they had a

873
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,000
good think tank with it too a lot of big

874
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,920
thinkers but I think there could be a

875
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,760
second intention you know the fact that

876
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,720
they drop more of it when everybody's

877
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,200
around Spirit of compassion told me that

878
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,160
it's possible that yeah there's a second

879
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,319
intention that developed because

880
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,040
whenever the weather is nice like I said

881
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:48,640
holidays around the world and so forth

882
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:51,359
it act the activity increases

883
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,760
greatly areas are strategically mapped

884
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,880
out all around the world there is a

885
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,599
method to this madness you guys there's

886
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,119
a method to this madness it's the

887
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,440
ultimate trick played upon us so you're

888
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,680
taking your selfie you have the sky

889
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
behind you and there's a streak going

890
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,440
across the

891
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,160
sky it's something I've learned to

892
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,880
accept throughout the decades in my life

893
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,319
as I look up and I see them all that

894
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,680
there's no fixing it it's one example of

895
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:22,880
how we have a spiritual war happening

896
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,160
you you might have heard me mention

897
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,359
spiritual war recently I'm going to be

898
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,960
talking about that more and more and

899
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,119
more more what's happening it's good

900
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,240
versus evil oh wait wait you might be

901
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,800
somebody that doesn't think there's

902
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,240
anything bad going on you might be

903
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,119
somebody that doesn't think there's evil

904
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,640
on any level and you think maybe

905
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,920
everybody has a good heart you know or

906
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,880
everybody's just kind of misdirected but

907
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,200
they're really good inside and they do

908
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,319
bad things and no there's there's

909
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,560
Darkness there is there is you know to

910
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:55,560
be more

911
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,119
precise hey evil tricking the good how

912
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,119
about that instead of good versus evil

913
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,440
evil tricking the good so the good

914
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,560
doesn't even know there is a fight one

915
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,359
of the examples of how we have evil

916
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,040
people in the world using their Free

917
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,480
Will well this is definitely one of

918
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,880
those examples of people doing evil

919
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,680
things it's a prime example of how

920
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,680
things aren't what they seem to be and

921
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,680
we stay distracted on other

922
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,760
environmental projects and I wonder if

923
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,760
you're thinking about that a little bit

924
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,400
while this thing that I'm talking about

925
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,760
here the chemtrail Saga the chemtrail

926
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,119
game well this one is completely ignored

927
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,280
organizations that are formed to protect

928
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,079
the environment right many that you know

929
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,960
they're aware of these Chemtrails but

930
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,760
they just ignore them too cuz they got

931
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,960
to they know they have to there's no way

932
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,079
of addressing it it look they're not

933
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,200
aware of the complexities maybe of these

934
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,280
Chemtrails at all who is nobody really

935
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,000
is nobody is but nevertheless they're

936
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,319
aware of something happening up there

937
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,560
these Chemtrails are responsible for the

938
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,119
flocks of birds that mysteriously die

939
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,440
did you guys ever hear about that have

940
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,720
you ever seen that where out of nowhere

941
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,319
a thousand Birds die and they're all

942
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,280
over the streets and all over a village

943
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:12,920
and all over a town or they're all over

944
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,359
a a a baseball diamond somewhere or they

945
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,920
all over a field somewhere and someone

946
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:22,480
you know stumbles across them all these

947
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,160
flocks of birds dying everywhere around

948
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,599
the planet at once the birds that swarm

949
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,160
and migrate just die and they hit the

950
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,359
ground and they rain it's raining birds

951
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,560
why is that happening the birds are

952
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,000
hitting pockets of these Chemtrails up

953
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,040
in the sky cuz the Chemtrails vary from

954
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,359
super super toxic sometimes deadly toxic

955
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,720
sometimes partially toxic somewhat

956
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:50,920
dangerous and because it's different

957
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,119
batches of old poisonous toxins you know

958
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,880
and stockpiles from any decade that

959
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,599
could be loaded up into the plane and

960
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,040
dropped over in the present moment right

961
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,680
now that's been in storage forever so

962
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,839
these birds hit these pockets of

963
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,359
dangerous chemicals up in the

964
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,440
sky and birds that are migrating in

965
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,480
massive swarms and SW and and swarms and

966
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,640
flocks occasionally they run into this

967
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,160
thick

968
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,680
Vaper and then dead birds rain on the

969
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,720
towns and here's the sad part that's

970
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,000
just when we see the birds what about in

971
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,440
all the places the birds fly the

972
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,599
Wilderness the forests and you don't see

973
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,280
them fall and die in there you know like

974
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,760
if a tree falls in the

975
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,920
woods you know if you don't hear it did

976
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,240
it really fall or whatever you know that

977
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,560
whole saying you guys could probably you

978
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,359
guys could say that better than I could

979
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,520
right now I'm sure but well hey if a

980
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,119
thousand birds at a clip fall into the

981
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,440
forest and no one hears it no one sees

982
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,880
it did it really happen yeah it did it

983
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,400
did happen it

984
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,000
did because birds fly in these swarms

985
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,079
and flocks over vast amounts of land

986
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,319
that are not populated by humans

987
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,800
Chemtrails will be the end of our birds

988
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:10,240
in the coming years way down the road

989
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,640
Birds won't be

990
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,280
chirping there are less Birds now than

991
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,240
ever before in our history and then hey

heal well you guys care about the bees

1002
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:43,480
there are theories that maybe it's the

1003
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,920
GMO food killing the bees oh I could see

1004
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,599
it now someone just got upset they're

1005
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,359
saying wait a minute he's Pro GMO no I'm

1006
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,440

1007
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,200

not pro GMO okay and I tell you things

1009
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,480
about GMO people don't know about in the

1010
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,920
GMO industry but with the but from

1011
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,160
Spirit of compassion of course it's

1012
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,079
where I get my unique original

1013
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,520
information but here's the thing you

1014
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,280
know yeah GMO food is not helping out

1015
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,480
the bees it's true for for a mult

1016
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,280
multitude of reasons and I know that but

1017
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,319
there's a more predominant problem the

1018
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,200
Chemtrails the Chemtrails are killing

1019
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,400
the

1020
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,760
bees yes huh the Chemtrails Rain On The

1021
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,760
Beekeeper

1022
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,480
and the bees it's crazy how that works

1023
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,760
right isn't that bizarre you know how

1024
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,880
the beekeeper is smoking out the bees to

1025
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,079
get the

1026
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,559
honey a little smoke smoke

1027
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,319
canister well the Chemtrails are smoking

1028
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,400
out The Beekeeper as he's doing that and

1029
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,359
the

1030
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,359
bees what's the irony to that one it's

1031
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,599
so it's so crazy you know when the bees

1032
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,520
are docile and they're crawling around

1033
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,480
on the ground and they're just dying a

1034
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,960
slow death have you ever seen a honeybee

1035
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,880
just crawling around and you're like

1036
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,839
honeybee I want to help you I want to

1037
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,760
help you get to a flower I want to get

1038
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,280
you to a flower get a little twig get a

1039
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,319
leaf and get the honeybee as he's

1040
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,599
crawling he must just need to go back on

1041
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,280
his flower and get some nectar maybe

1042
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,520
he's unhappy what's wrong with him and

1043
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,880
how many times have you heard that I

1044
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,280
mean I've not only heard that but I've

1045
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,800
seen that myself I've seen it I've seen

1046
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,000
people talk to me about it like oh my

1047
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,000
God you wouldn't believe these bees are

1048
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,240
crawling on the ground and somebody be

1049
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,680
like well it's the Time of the Season

1050
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,319
well did the bees sting you and then the

1051
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,720
Stinger's gone and that's why the bees

1052
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,200
crawling on the ground no no that's not

1053
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,119
why the bee's crawling on the

1054
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,640
ground you know when those bees are

1055
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,200
docile like that and crawling on the

1056
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,040
ground like that they're dying a slow

1057
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,440
death because of chemtrails birds and

1058
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,520
bees are canaries in the coal mine they

1059
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:52,680
go first before us and guess what goes

1060
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,319
next the dragon flies they're dying

1061
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,280
they're the other Canary they're getting

1062
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,520
sicker and sicker and sicker and slower

1063
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,520
and slower than ever and we need those

1064
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,480
dragon flies we need those

1065
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,800
desperately

1066
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,960
butterflies bye-bye butterflies for the

1067
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
future because butterflies are going to

1068
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,240
take a big hit big hit from the

1069
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,920
Chemtrails and they already are and then

1070
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,000
we have the schools of fish wait a

1071
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,920
minute you know the schools of fish that

1072
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,160
die by the hundreds of thousands in our

1073
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,880
oceans they wash up on the shore and

1074
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,720
everybody's smelling dead fish and

1075
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,800
freaking out environmentalists are

1076
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,960
testing the water and freaking out and

1077
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,520
nobody knows what happened at all it's

1078
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,960
just nobody knows what happened and all

1079
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,440
these fish are just sharks too sharks

1080
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,200

that algae bloom come from how does that

1090
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,079
work that's why you see from time to

1091
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,200
time the stories out there are

1092
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,359
devastating about you know the amount of

1093
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,720
dead fish and other sea life what about

shore rotting and what about all the

1096
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,800
kill offs that aren't being talked about

1097
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,079
or seen that's just the ones that are

1098
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,119
seen you know Spirit of compassion you

1099
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,079
know tells me about these chemical soups

1100
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,800
that drop out of the PLS and what they

1101
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:34,520
do they

1102
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:37,680
pull you know they pull in areas of the

1103
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,960
ocean that are more stagnant because of

1104
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,559
different currents so the chemical soups

1105
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,880
that have this mutated toxic algae

1106
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,680
that's 50 60 years old sometimes that

1107
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,359
just came out of an old tank and was

1108
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,160
just recently stuck into a plane and

1109
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,839
then dumped on us that algae okay that

1110
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,760
dangerous toxic stuff it ends up

1111
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,480
proliferating and thriving in more

1112
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,400
stagnant areas naturally stagnant

1113
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,240
because of just the current of you know

1114
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,880
edies and oceans and and and movement

1115
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,599
and all that and then fish swimming

1116
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,280
along they're trying to get food whoa

1117
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,839
schools of fish are like Whoa We got

1118
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,400
some good stuff to eat we're going we're

1119
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:17,720
going and they hit these poles of

1120
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,960
chemicals and toxic mutated

1121
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,000
microorganisms and algaes and they die

1122
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,000
fast just like birds

1123
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,520
instantly they just die and it's

1124
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,960
immediately f for the fish and the birds

1125
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,680
welcome to the Chemtrails welcome to the

1126
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,760
Chemtrails in 20 years from now the

1127
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:43,200
plane fleets will be increased greatly

1128
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:46,119
the goal is the to have a vast Fleet the

1129
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,359
chemtrail planes already take up a large

1130
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,599
percentage of the sky as far as with the

1131
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,720
flight patterns and everything and you

1132
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,280
know what's crazy is the flight Towers

1133
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,200
they just have to ignore it I mean

1134
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,800
forget the radar well what are all these

1135
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,720
planes oh they're not passenger planes

1136
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,599
and what are they everybody has to

1137
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,920
ignore it that's that is really

1138
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
interesting right I know everybody's

1139
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,720
worried about 5G right now and I'm going

1140
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,760
to talk about 5G eventually and go into

1141
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,680
that and if it affects her health or if

1142
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,119
not or however I'm going to go into that

1143
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,200
whole thing we're going to cover it and

1144
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,160
we're going to get there don't worry and

1145
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,440
spirit and compassion will have powerful

1146
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,440
information nobody knows about it

1147
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,559
meanwhile no one's worried about the

1148
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:32,040
chemtrail game and yeah it's a game it's

1149
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,640
a sick game I call it a game because

1150
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,520
Spirit of compassion tells me it's

1151
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:40,839
become one it has you know Spirit of

1152
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,440
compassion tells me that the industry

1153
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:45,800
the chemical Industries worldwide they

1154
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,000
want us focused on other targets you

1155
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,880
know they want us focused on 5G they

1156
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,799
want us focused on anything else that's

1157
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,400
bad they just don't want it focused on

1158
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:57,000
those Chemtrails that's bad I call it a

1159
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,119
game like I said cuz it's become one and

1160
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,559
look they want us focused on this they

1161
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,440
want us focused on plastic bags which is

1162
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,799
it's good focus it is they want us to

1163
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,520
focus on cups and straws and toilet

1164
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:09,799
paper rolls you know like empty toilet

1165
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,480
paper

1166
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:15,400
rolls cans and bottles uh they want us

1167
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,400
focus on creating less trash I think

1168
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,640
it's all important I stand behind all of

1169
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,040
that that that is important it CU it is

1170
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,200
right but you know yeah it's like when

1171
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,880
I'm taking the bottles you know and I'm

1172
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,760
taking whatever like the recyclables to

1173
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,920
the garbage and I look up and I see the

1174
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,520
Chemtrails up there uh I I mean yeah I'm

1175
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,559
looking at all the Chemtrails in the sky

1176
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,400
while I'm trying to recycle stuff it's

1177
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,960
it's it's a tough one to swallow right I

1178
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,200
don't know it's it's hard for me because

1179
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,799
I'm like maybe what cuz I know so much

1180
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,160
about this stuff and you're just like

1181
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:48,960
you're looking up at the sky and you see

1182
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,160
10 Chemtrails and you're like what Brew

1183
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,280
is that is that from 20 years ago is

1184
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,520
that from 60 years ago what kind of

1185
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,440
toxic crap is that coming down is it

1186
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,520
pesticide you know byproduct is it an

1187
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,880
herbicide byproduct what could what

1188
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,960
could it be and you know you sit there

1189
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:08,480
and then you put your recyclables in the

1190
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,720
bin and look I mean you can look in this

1191
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,440
guy many times and you'll see 30 40

1192
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,839
Chemtrails just drifting along they

1193
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,400
drift along

1194
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,559
forever but I get it we have to do our

1195
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,520
part and we have to be mindful about the

1196
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,359
environment which I stand behind 100%

1197
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,119
we're being Mindful and they're playing

1198
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,720
a sick joke on us and look maybe you

1199
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,359
don't see it that way I kind of do a

1200
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,599
little bit the Chemtrails they settle in

1201
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:36,000
the early morning de so check this out

1202
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,319
this is an important piece of

1203
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,240
information the Chemtrails they're

1204
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,559
falling all night long and they fall

1205
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,400
during the day too but there's a

1206
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:47,359
difference in the morning right around

1207
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,920
Dawn there's this moisture that occurs

1208
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,880
and that moisture ends up on your car

1209
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,599
windshield that moisture ends up on the

1210
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,559
grass in the summertime where it's wet

1211
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,480
in the morning and you'll find that

1212
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,160
happening a lot and when you're walking

1213
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,359
along you can even get soak and wet in

1214
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,599
the grass if you're walking on a lawn

1215
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:04,880
you know first thing in the morning

1216
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,400
early that moisture holds in the air in

1217
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,920
the morning and it holds on and suspends

1218
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,680
all that chemtrail that's been dropped

1219
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,400
down and it tends to Harbor underneath

1220
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,680
the tree line so when people are jogging

1221
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,240
and they're jogging they're running in

1222
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,200
the morning out they're out in the

1223
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,000
streets jogging running wherever they

1224
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,480
are or they're walking on Trails or

1225
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,599
whatever it is they're inhaling more

1226
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,400
they're inhaling more the Chemtrails at

1227
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,400
that time in the morning it hasn't kind

1228
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,640
of lifted and blown away yet it hasn't

1229
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,839
kind of moved and shaken out of it so

1230
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,160
when we're doing our workouts and we're

1231
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,559
doing that we're breathing in and

1232
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,520
inhaling more chemtrail and we're

1233
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,079
sweating and we're absorbing it into our

1234
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,680
pores that's what happens and you know

1235
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,880
that's why look we'll talk about some

1236
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,359
tips and some things to just think about

1237
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,839
protect ourselves and everything and all

1238
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,920
that coming up but check this out our

1239
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,319
skies are supposed to be sacred right I

1240
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,920
mean do you think our skies are sacred

1241
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:04,119
do they mean something to you when you

1242
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,760
look up into the sky I mean you look up

1243
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:07,280
there do you ever lay on your back on

1244
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,440
the ground and you're looking at the

1245
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,880
clouds as they're changing shape and you

1246
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,240
see different shapes in the clouds and

1247
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,559
we look up look at them in awe and we

1248
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,599
think about the things hey there's a

1249
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:19,799
horse up there look that cloud looks

1250
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,160
like a horse hey that cloud looks like

1251
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:23,640
something else and what about the fact

1252
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,880
that we pray too so many people pray and

1253
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,520
the sky means everything what about

1254
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,079
meditation we meditate with a sensation

1255
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,720
of something above us don't we like when

1256
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,920
you meditate are you thinking or feeling

1257
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,559
something above you when you're

1258
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,480
meditating like the sky or the universe

1259
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:44,760
that feeling above us and you know

1260
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,799
children fly kites right in the sky you

1261
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,280
look at the sky and you're flying a kite

1262
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:52,520
on a windy day we feel the Sunshine on

1263
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,480
our faces and we look at the falling

1264
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,640
stars at night have you ever looked for

1265
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,359
falling stars and you dream and we look

1266
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,599
at the

1267
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:04,319
constellations meanwhile what's going on

1268
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,359
here on our planet yeah is sad and

1269
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,599
corrupt this is one of the many reasons

1270
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:12,440
why I get disappointed when people in

1271
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,119
the health movement don't think we need

1272
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,240

movement yeah there's many of them that

1275
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,839
don't think we need to cleanse and if

1276
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,799
they do think we need a cleanse it's a

1277
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,799
cleanse that doesn't get any cleansing

1278
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:27,319

don't know what's causing our illness um

1287
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,680
they don't know why everybody has

1288
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,280

and numbness and aches and pains and

1294

depression people don't know why chronic

1295
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:05,520
illness is still just completely not

1296
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,440
understood and

1297
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,599
misunderstood unless they've gotten

1298
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,839
tidbits from medical medium information

1299
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,119
throughout the years you know like

1300
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:18,480
celery juice therapeutically 16 o or 32

1301
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,440
o or 64 ounces on an empty stomach and

1302
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,839
how to use it making sure you don't mix

1303
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,559
anything with it the world wasn't

1304
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,440
drinking celery juice before Spirit of

1305
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:30,040
compassion put it out there and in the

1306
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,920
way therapeutically like you know he has

1307
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,440
but everybody's a health expert these

1308
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,839
days but what's interesting about

1309
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,520
everybody being a health expert these

1310
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:38,960
days they don't have a clue about why

1311
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,200
we're even sick or what we're even up

1312
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:45,480
against and this is just one reason why

1313
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,760
we have to take care of ourselves is

1314
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,640
because of this very reason here the

1315
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,040
same reason why nobody knew what was

1316
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,160
happening with these Chemtrails people

1317
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,839
who believe Chemtrails exist don't know

1318
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,119
how it works and everything else and I'm

1319
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:02,040
giving you the I'm giving you the

1320
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:03,720
information right now but hey that's

1321
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,880
what I mean there's even more things

1322
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,680
than that there's so much more and look

1323
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,440
what's in the medical medium books about

1324
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,440
why we're sick there's a reason why we

1325
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,200
have to take care of ourselves we need

1326
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,040
extra help but we need the right tools

1327
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,119
your body needs to be

1328
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,920
validated it needs to know you

1329
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,520
understand its fight like you understand

1330
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,720
what it's up against your body needs to

1331
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,039
not only have like the right tools that

1332
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,440
you possess to offer your body but it

1333
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,839
needs to know you're in the game that

1334
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,039
you're in it with it and that's the

1335
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,760
whole thing because our bodies are on

1336
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,200
their own and then we're all playing

1337
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,480
guessing games that's how it works out

1338
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,839
there you know it's like people they'd

1339
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,280
rather just think that maybe you know

1340
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,559
their health problem is a little bit

1341
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,000
their gut their microbiomes off or

1342
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,280
something their gut floor is off and

1343
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,760
that's why everything like it's all in

1344
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,039
their gut and that's why they're sick

1345
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,640
and that's why they have eczema or acne

1346
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,160
or any kind of other condition or

1347
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,480
fatigue maybe they think it's genetics

1348
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,240
too or it's hormones or they need to be

1349
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,119
rewired and it's all in their head like

1350
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,680
their train of thought isn't good and

1351
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,319
it's time to rewire their mind or get

1352
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,039
their meditations right and you know and

1353
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,599
maybe it's okay if it's autoimmune and

1354
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,920
your body's attacking itself kind of

1355
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,119
thought but people they just don't

1356
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,839
really give their bodies the

1357
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,039
understanding their body needs and

1358
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,880
that's a problem out there and I know a

1359
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:27,720
lot of people they believe they're

1360
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,559
Health experts or they want to become

1361
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,760
Health experts and they don't know what

1362
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,680
we're really up against or what causes

1363
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,720
Hashimoto thyroiditis or what causes

1364
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,680
rheumatoid arthritis or what causes

1365
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,000
chronic fatigue or eczema and psoriasis

1366
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,200
and anxiety and tingles and numbness and

1367
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,240
AES and pains and vertigo and if you

1368
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:51,559
don't know what causes all that and then

1369
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:55,079
you don't know what contributes to all

1370
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:58,839
of that and your body's like hey help me

1371
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:00,880

there's toxic heavy metals and there's

1380
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,880
Chemtrails falling out of the sky and

1381
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,760
there's pathogens and bacteria viruses

1382
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,640
and there's the Epstein bar and all in

1383
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,480
petrochemicals in our system and

1384
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,000
everything else and I need you to work

1385
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,680
with me here and that's what our bodies

1386
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,880
are like wanting but we get thrown off

1387
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,400
track and and it happens every day I see

1388
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,680
it out there people are worried about

1389
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,640
collagen and you know I get it but

1390
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,240
they're doing that while they're

1391
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,039
guzzling down coffee and burning out

1392
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,760
their adrenals I think look the bottom

1393
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:52,079
line is it's about like are you going to

1394
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,480
work with your body because it's not

1395
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,160
hopeless it's not and I still got to I

1396
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,799
got a cover more on chem trols I'm still

1397
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,240
heading in there we got more information

1398
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:04,359
about chem trols that I have to talk

1399
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:07,240
about but it's not hopeless when you

1400
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:10,240
work with your body and you look out for

1401
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,520
it and you understand it and it

1402
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,640
understands you and we just we work

1403
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,160
together as the Chemtrails fall out of

1404
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,920
the sky they have to land somewhere and

1405
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:23,000
you might be somebody that's like hey I

1406
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,559
eat really good food I eat grass-fed

1407
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,760
beef but the chem Trails they got to

1408
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,680
land on the

1409
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,720
fields and the rain washes them into the

1410
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,319
Earth too and if you maybe you're maybe

1411
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,640
you don't eat animal products maybe

1412
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:37,680
you're vegan maybe you're plant-based

1413
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:43,039
and all the Chemtrails just on all our

1414
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:45,520
vegetables it's on everything we eat and

1415
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,520
the soil gets disrupted because it gets

1416
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,880
depleted of zinc nobody knows about this

1417
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,920
information I've talked about that

1418
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,599
Metals fall from the sky that's the

1419
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,839
Chemtrails I've been talking about all

1420
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,039
these years you guys Metals fall from

1421
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,559
the skies they soak into the store they

1422
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:03,280
soak into the

1423
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:05,359
soil and they destroy microorganisms the

1424
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,359
soil born microorganisms in the soil

1425
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:11,240
they kill the soil and they deplete it

1426
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,559
of zinc and our soil becomes immune

1427
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,200
deficient that's what happens from

1428
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,920
Chemtrails now look we still need to eat

1429
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,680
our Foods we still need to eat you know

1430
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,039
our organic foods we can't get organic

1431
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,079
we get you know conventional but the

1432
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,319
point is is that we need to take care of

1433
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,039
our body

1434
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:29,000
while we're eating and living here we

1435
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,799
have to adapt and then if you're doing

1436
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,960
the animal proteins well I do I do

1437
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,720
grass-fed beef somebody might say I got

1438
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,480
it down I'll do a little grass fed beef

1439
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,000
I do Freer range chicken or whatever and

1440
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,520
animals or I do lamb or something

1441
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,039
animals graze any kind of animals that

1442
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,480
graze and they're eating grass or

1443
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,839
they're eating meal of some kind that

1444
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,000
was raised either way with chems falling

1445
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,440
on it it was grown with chems falling on

1446
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,839
it either way animals that graze in the

1447
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,720
ground grass that grass is loaded with

1448
00:59:56,839 --> 01:00:02,119
Chemtrails and it builds up in

1449
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,480
concentrations inside the animals so

1450
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:05,920
that grassfed beef or grass-fed butter

1451
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,319
will still have concentrations of

1452
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,160
chemical soup that won't even be tested

1453
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,720
because they don't they're not testing

1454
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,640
for that they're not finding what's in

1455
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:18,920
Chemtrails in our food that builds up in

1456
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,960
our bodies when you eat it they're not

1457
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,000
looking cuz they don't even know what to

1458
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,079
look for guess what because 90% of the

1459
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,160
chemicals falling out of the sky

1460
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:31,280
from these Chemtrails are

1461
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,920
unidentified they're privatized

1462
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:37,240
chemicals they're secret soups and

1463
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,319
recipes made by the chemical industry

1464
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,119
that don't even they have their own that

1465
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:43,119
don't even have patents never mind the

1466
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,280
ones that are patented they're still

1467
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,720
their own recipe no one knows what's in

1468
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,720
most of the stuff especially their

1469
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,799
mistakes and their test ones they're

1470
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,799
test runs nobody knows what's in this

1471
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:55,880
stuff so it's not even anybody's even

1472
01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:58,599
testing this stuff stuff in our food

1473
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,680
that's how sad it is and if you don't

1474
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,520
know how to assist your body in getting

1475
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,359
this stuff out of you well it leads to

1476
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,319
problems down the road and you might be

1477
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,880
somebody that's like I don't want to

1478
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,480
know about it I don't want to know I got

1479
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,000
a friend that's like that just doesn't

1480
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,280
want to know doesn't want to know what's

1481
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,599
being dropped on them rather just you

1482
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:19,400
know I want a glass of wine and just

1483
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:21,920
leave me alone and I kind of want to do

1484
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,880
my thing sure okay fine fine when you're

1485
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,440
sick down the road whatever and but the

1486
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,359
thing is that zinc deficiencies we all

1487
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,680
have you know that's because the soil is

1488
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:35,520
getting depleted by Chemtrails is being

1489
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,240
a big part of it and when we have no

1490
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,640
zinc in us or very little zinc in us

1491
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:42,359
it's why we get sick from

1492
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,240
viruses any kind of virus virus that's

1493
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:46,039
going around whatever any kind of virus

1494
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,559
the Epstein bars that people are passing

1495
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,480
around the shingles viruses the hhv 6es

1496
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,839
the hhv 7s the simplex 1 and Simplex 2

1497
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,559
just because you had a cold sore years

1498
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,640
ago doesn't mean that simplex virus

1499
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:59,400
isn't living inside of our livers and

1500
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,440
our bodies and wreaking havoc and giving

1501
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,200
us other symptoms see nobody knows all

1502
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,920
this information they just don't

1503
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,319
understand that but you know in order to

1504
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,599
adapt in order to take care of ourselves

1505
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:14,400
we have to

1506
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:16,240
adapt and that's a big part of it and

1507
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,760
you know what's funny all the

1508
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,279
information Spirit of compassion gives

1509
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,599
me in the volumes I put out there and

1510
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:25,480
the frontier head of Frontier

1511
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,799
groundbreaking information in

1512
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,119
alternative medicine conventional

1513
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,799
medicine that that I've put out over the

1514
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,319
years and with all of that you'll hear

1515
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:35,960
out there lymphatic system Anthony

1516
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,520
doesn't know about the lymphatic system

1517
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,440
he doesn't know he doesn't know anything

1518
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,920
about the lymphatic system it's

1519
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,480
like are you kidding me my god do you

1520
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,480
know anything about the

1521
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,920
Chemtrails you know never mind that and

1522
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,520
it's interesting you'll hear from people

1523
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,039
like he doesn't know about the lymphatic

1524
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,720
system you'll hear that from people that

1525
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,400
don't know why anyone's sick they don't

1526
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,160
know why people have viruses or what

1527
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,839
kind of viruses or why people are sick

1528
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,000
with anything or where toxic heavy

1529
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:07,200
metals sit in the liver in the brain or

1530
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,200
any of that stuff and if they did get a

1531
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,319
tidbit of that somewhere so 35 years of

1532
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,559
work of putting it out there Spirit of

1533
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,200
compassion's work all these years you

1534
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,640
know the health movement it was a small

1535
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,119
small world it still is now but it was a

1536
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,680
small world back 35 years ago really

1537
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,160
really small and so that information I

1538
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,400
just put it out there and put it out

1539
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,920
there and put it out there you know but

1540
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,000
what's interesting about the lymphatic

1541
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,440
system is people be like hey doesn't

1542
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,720
know about the lymphatic system you

1543
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,279
kidding I've written about it in the

1544
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:38,079
books but that's coming from people who

1545
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:41,400
don't even know why anybody's sick like

1546
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:44,319
I said before and really you got to go

1547
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,599
deeper past the lymphatic system that's

1548
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,079
where you have to go you have to go

1549
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,680
where real problems are inside the body

1550
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,680
like bigger problems much bigger

1551
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,279
problems like deep in the liver because

1552
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,839
that's what I've been talking about all

1553
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:59,079
all these years and all these years

1554
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:02,240
lymphatic system cleanses out its Poison

1555
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:04,039
by default on its own it's doing that as

1556
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,440
you live and breathe and and live your

1557
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:08,359
life but if your liver's clogged up and

1558
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,720
stagnant and sluggish and you got

1559
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:13,359
low-grade viruses nobody wants to know

1560
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,559
about because the lymphatic system isn't

1561
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:17,440
why you have Lupus your lymphatic like

1562
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:19,240
the lymphatic system isn't causing that

1563
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,799
your lymphatic system is not causing

1564
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,480
neurological symptoms it's not causing

1565
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:26,079
tingles and numbness and aches and pains

1566
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,720
and ticks and spasms and burning skin

1567
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,960
and floaters in the eyes and severe

1568
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,720
fatigue your lymphatic system doesn't do

1569
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,559
that it doesn't create it's not causing

1570
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:40,079
your edema it's coming from a deeper

1571
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:42,960
Source it's coming from pathogens your

1572
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,319
lymphatic system doesn't cause lupus it

1573
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,839
doesn't cause Hashimoto it doesn't cause

1574
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:49,680
lime it doesn't c yeah that's what's so

1575
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:52,319
funny it's like oh it's the lymphatic

1576
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,839
system that's really interesting but you

1577
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:57,440
know your lymphatic system's health

1578
01:04:54,839 --> 01:05:01,000
happens to be a direct result of your

1579
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,680
liver's Health it's a direct result of

1580
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,960
if you have pathogens and that's what

1581
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,559
people all have and they're all passing

1582
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:11,160
around and if you're just focused on the

1583
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:14,359
lymphatic system but not the real

1584
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,599
problem it's like cleaning your house

1585
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:16,799
you know you're cleaning your house

1586
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,920
you're cleaning your bedroom you're

1587
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,520
cleaning your rooms you're cleaning your

1588
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,359
bathroom you're cleaning your kitchen

1589
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,279
spotless you're scrubbing your kitchen

1590
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:26,079
sink you know you're trying you're

1591
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:27,319
cleaning it all that's your lymphatic

1592
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,400
system you know you're cleaning

1593
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:33,680
everything Meanwhile your basement has

1594
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,039
rats fering in it mice festering and it

1595
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,599
roaches ants and termites and they live

1596
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:39,520
in your basement and they're breeding

1597
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,200
and nesting and devouring the very

1598
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,079
Foundation of your house but you're

1599
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,440
worried about your lymphatic system and

1600
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,000
you're cleaning the up upstairs there

1601
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,520
and you're cleaning the upstairs and

1602
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,920
you're not even you're you know that's

1603
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,760
the thing so people pretending the

1604
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,160
lymphatic system is why we're sick is

1605
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,720
really a joke I mean that's a joke I

1606
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,880
mean that's

1607
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:02,960
101 um let's see beginners back I don't

1608
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,720
know uh years ago when nobody knew what

1609
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,200
why anybody's sick and once again well

1610
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:11,520
is it candida uh is it lymphatic system

1611
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:14,000
is it gut is it what is it it's back to

1612
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,799
that game so it's kind of sad and when I

1613
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,240
see that out there it's kind of sad

1614
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:19,760
meanwhile yeah you drink your celery

1615
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,079
juice and you're going to go for the

1616
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,400
deeper problems therapeutically you do

1617
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,319
your heavy metal detox smoothie you go

1618
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,880
for the deeper problems therapeutically

1619
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:32,680
go with 32 o of lemon water you go to

1620
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,200
the deeper root like deeper and then

1621
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,839
that's just the start of some of the

1622
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,960
medical medium tools that got around

1623
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:41,760
over the last 35 plus years and so when

1624
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,039
you talk about the lymphatic system you

1625
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,839
missed the point of allog together about

1626
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,039
everything else the

1627
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:50,000
pathogens everything we're dealing with

1628
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:52,720
all the toxins like from the Chemtrails

1629
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,559
we inhale daily that have to go into the

1630
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,720
liver cuz that's where they go they go

1631
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,720
into the liver and all these other

1632
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,319
toxins they just go and they they make

1633
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,640
our liver sick and stagnant and that has

1634
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:07,440
to get sick and stagnant first for your

1635
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:10,079
lymphatic system to even have any issues

1636
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,000
you have there has to be a sicker deeper

1637
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,200
problem you I'll be talking about the

1638
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,279
lymphatic system in the future we're

1639
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,640
going to do a whole podcast inside and

1640
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:20,599
out about the lymphatic system but why

1641
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:24,599
do I want you to do lemon water in the

1642
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:26,960
morning more than 8 O much more than 8 O

1643
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:30,559
why do I want you to do lemon water 16

1644
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,680
to 32 o because it's purifying more than

1645
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:35,920
just your lymphatic system I'm trying to

1646
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:38,160
go for the deeper stuff I'm trying to go

1647
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,119
for the deeper stuff not the surface

1648
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,960
stuff I'm not trying to go for the

1649
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,559
surface stuff the lymphatic system isn't

1650
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:47,079
why somebody's bedridden and they got

1651
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:50,200
like the worst hives and lupus and

1652
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:52,160
migraines and trigeminal neuralgia and

1653
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:55,279
their back is killing them and they

1654
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,079
could barely walk and they're feet hurt

1655
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:59,200
that's not the lymphatic system I mean

1656
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:01,520
it's so embarrassing when I think about

1657
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,920
it it's so beginner stupid I mean I'm

1658
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:09,359
sorry I'm sorry it's just look

1659
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,720
anyway the lemon water is critical for

1660
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:13,960
flushing to get to the Deep rooted

1661
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,960
things the cell juice is critical for

1662
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,279
using it therapeutically to destroy

1663
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,279
pathogens that are deep inside the liver

1664
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:22,960
deep ins seter organs that are in their

1665
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:25,040
bloodstream and so forth you know and

1666
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,640
the celer juice is disarming these

1667
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,319
toxins that fall from the sky and all

1668
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,960
that stuff see the tools are all here

1669
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,640
I've always had you in mind for what we

1670
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,560
face and what you don't know you face

1671
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,759
out

1672
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,560
there Chemtrails are part of the

1673
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:47,239
spiritual war that's going on around us

1674
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:50,359
and above us Mercury is part of that

1675
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:52,880
spiritual war that's going around us the

1676
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:56,440
caffeine industry is part of that

1677
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:59,279
spiritual war that's going on around us

1678
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,759
so many pieces of the puzzle that show

1679
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:05,719
us there's good versus evil and how evil

1680
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,440
looks for ways to control people and

1681
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,520
then keeps them controlled and then gets

1682
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:14,199
them sick and has The Thirst to keep

1683
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,920
them sick forever if possible and then

1684
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:21,600
wants them relying on everything they

1685
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:24,159
just don't really need Darkness never

1686
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,080
wants her eyes open and see what's in

1687
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:30,000
the sky and above the trees it would

1688
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:33,560
rather have us unknowing its time and

1689
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,040
then bring us to our knees they keep us

1690
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:39,759
busy down here distracted some are bored

1691
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,400
they want us to lose ourselves in our

1692
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:45,400
minds while all the bad around us keeps

1693
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,480
getting ignored there is hope when

1694
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,719
you're empowered though you have the

1695
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:53,719
truth on your side and the knowledge and

1696
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,520
you support your body with what it needs

1697
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:59,760
and you understand your body as it cries

1698
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,199
for help and asks you please when you're

1699
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,600
on the same page with your body then

1700
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:07,000
you're in the

1701
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,000
game see that's what matters in order to

1702
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,120
let the good things in life remain when

1703
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,080
you have the tools and you apply them

1704
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,719
right you are unstoppable against evil

1705
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,199
and you're gaining all the Insight

1706
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:23,719
because as they drop that stuff down on

1707
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:26,520
us you can laugh at it as it's coming on

1708
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:28,520
on down it's not going to get in your

1709
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:32,159
way because you're taking care of

1710
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:35,280
yourself now you can say I'm in control

1711
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:38,239
of my life I got the wisdom I got the

1712
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,679
Deep spiritual Insight I have control

1713
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:44,080
over my well-being you're not going to

1714
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:47,360
take control over me see I can live my

1715
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,719
life the way I want to be and keep from

1716
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:53,159
getting sick and recover if I've been

1717
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:56,199
sickened if need be I'm not blind when I

1718
01:10:53,159 --> 01:11:00,040
look at the sky the Wall's not over my

1719
01:10:56,199 --> 01:11:02,880
eyes anymore I can see past the Horizon

1720
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:05,800
I could see past the madness I can see

1721
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,640
past the smoke and see past the fog I

1722
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:11,480
can use my own free will to determine

1723
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,880
where life is going to go for me I can

1724
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:17,960
fight to be free and heal my body and

1725
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:21,239
see the path where it's going for me

1726
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:24,480
remember this your body has the power to

1727
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:28,199
heal and can override through thick and

1728
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:31,280
thin and our bodies fight for us as we

1729
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:35,040
acknowledge and validate our B's fight

1730
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:41,199
along the way then nothing can get in

1731
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:43,679
the way see I believe in you and I know

1732
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,679
