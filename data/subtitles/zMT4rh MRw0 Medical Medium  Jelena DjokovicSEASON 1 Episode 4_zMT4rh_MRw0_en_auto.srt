74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,870
grateful for everything you do on all

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,090
the channels you do because you are

76
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,130
really working your butt off to reach

77
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,990
every single person out there there's so

78
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,790
many people struggling out there I mean

79
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,140
you know it's like a war zone out there

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,790
people don't realize that and I say what

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,440
am i living in a bubble and nobody's

82
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,330
sick out there so science of research

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,220
fixed everything so science research

84
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,160
must have everything fixed no one's sick

85
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,420
out there so but that's not true I mean

86
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:28,260
just in America alone over 250 million

87
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,510
citizens just you know 250 million alone

88
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,380
or suffering here you know it's

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:38,430
incredible my resolutions and and

90
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,290
honestly I was never in or I came to

91
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,290
this knowledge for me all the motivation

92
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,760
comes as how I can be the healthiest you

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,070
know what is the healthiest we can be

94
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,720
and then you talk about that and you

95
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,570
talk about us as people rather than

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,430
patients and all these symptoms we have

97
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,130
because I have plenty of symptoms that I

98
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,780
never qualify them as a part of

99
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,799
something because we're supposed to

100
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,720
think it's normal

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,090
yes I tell you guys out there only time

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,310
rate how many times I asked you about it

103
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,110
like yeah can you tell me what is the

104
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,780
healthiest I can feel today in this

105
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,760
society with all the toxins that are

106
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,290
happening around us you know we are

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,810
breeding in and eat

108
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,039
and what is the healthiest we can be you

109
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,840
know it's a lot more time the funny

110
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,419
thing is a lot more toxic now than it

111
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,520
ever was when you think about the cities

112
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,800
in the old days you know have you ever

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,940
hear like stories of you got to move out

114
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:34,050
of the city to get to the country this

115
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,820
guy right there on the left side saying

116
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,710
to me you couldn't you've got to stay

117
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,870
out of LA for now there is this fight

118
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,280
wildfire the wildfires yeah that's right

119
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,229
and there are so many people who didn't

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,180
go out of LA had to stay and breathe in

121
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,310
all the toxins and so how do they feel

122
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,020
now well you know it together wildfires

123
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,599
and then the fire retardant that sprayed

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,430
and all the dust and all the ashes and

125
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,380
so we're always up get something whether

126
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,360
it's that or any kind of anything else

127
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,490
that's just added extra stuff that no

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
one needs so ease it a solution to move

129
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,449
to countryside well you know what it is

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
though it's like the cities used to be

131
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,169
like I always say the cities are really

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,090
dirty and cities are dirty and go to the

133
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,650
country and that was many years ago and

134
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,410
I've never told you guys about this but

135
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,060
they talk about this but now the cities

136
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,979
are worse than they've ever been and the

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,990
country is also not good either where

138
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:22,139
we're always exposed to something every

139
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,300
basically there's no everybody's exposed

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,460
in every place it doesn't matter where

141
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,099
it is every country the city it could be

142
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,510
anywhere and so we have to take care of

143
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,800
ourselves we have to learn and take care

144
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,150
of ourselves that's the whole point it's

145
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,470
not that we're supposed to run and hide

146
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,370
it's not supposed to that we're supposed

147
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,659
to meaning never get it ever affected or

148
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,150
intoxicated by anything it's not that

149
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:44,039
it's just that where we need to take

150
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,440
care of ourselves we need to do things

151
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,270
and the medical medium information is

152
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,650
what I you know always read out there

153
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,389
and say look you got to take care of

154
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,400
your liver because it collects it all

155
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,400
that's why you like liver book probably

156
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,590
for me the book that I carry around a

157
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:06,930
lot even though it's the heaviest one

158
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:09,030
and is this one and luckily it's also

159
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,460
translated in Serbian so when I speak

160
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,979
with my friends and family I also make

161
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,080
sure I refer them to the book and trust

162
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,240
me you are big because if it's

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,180
translated in serve in translated in

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,370
surgeon I mean that's your ultimate goal

165
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,050
you want to reach those kind of people

166
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,780
because they are open to knowledge I

167
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,330
mean I'm saying

168
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,770
to everybody from Serbia don't go down

169
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,130
you don't go back to prospects either

170
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,560
Cosmo and I'm just telling them go guys

171
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,110
by the books I'm also speaking about it

172
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,260
also in on all my channels because for

173
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,300
me this is the knowledge I am I applied

174
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,520
to my children's lives in my life and

175
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,750
also my husband is using lots of those

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,090
now lots of that kind of knowledge and

177
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:55,090
it's a Holy Grail you know if you want

178
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,730
to feel energized and youthful through

179
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,180
life because we don't feel that way and

180
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,980
that's what healthy means yeah yeah when

181
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,350
we walk around with symptoms we think

182
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,419
it's normal it's a new norm new norm to

183
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,700
have endometriosis normal to have PCOS

184
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,210
fibroids in norm to have all these

185
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,760
issues

186
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,650
Divac diabetes new norm to actually have

187
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,050
high a1c high blood sure

188
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,430
you know hypoglycemia thyroid problems

189
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,800
so we walk around we all have

190
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,360
hypothyroid right and we walk around

191
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,860
with it and it's just it's the new

192
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,970
normal we're just supposed to accept it

193
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,260
and then we're supposed to believe

194
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,940
science that research has all the

195
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,260
answers for some reason so we're

196
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,120
supposed to believe in all the studies

197
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,400
and all the science is thrown around and

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,110
and the vegans have all the answers and

199
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,880
then the Palio's have all the answers in

200
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:41,080
the animal protein high-protein low

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,810
protein high fat they're not healthy

202
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,180
it's like it doesn't work that way being

203
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,190
labeled as vegan also brings out

204
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,770
different kinds of food that we eat that

205
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,669
are not the healthiest option for us a

206
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,740
fried french fries that's vegan food but

207
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,810
is it the best one for you so a lot of

208
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,050
vegans don't eat good that's a you need

209
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,400
right yeah yeah totally and this is

210
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,979
what's gonna happen because there is a

211
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,530
huge vegan trend that is actually

212
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,090
sending us off the rails because we're

213
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,100
gonna get even sicker because we're

214
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,080
eating lab food as well because you know

215
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,910
those burgers out there are sausages or

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,600
cheese you mean that the fake sausages

217
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,100
the fake means that I got all those

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,830
absolutely and last tried them they do

219
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,600
they do taste well but they feel bad

220
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,639
after and like my body does not let me

221
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,639
do those things

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,650
it's just alerts me straight on and I am

223
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,510
skinny but that's how I feel good not

224
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,310
about looking good it's about feeling

225
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,769
good and this is what people don't know

226
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,539
what it is well if a plant-based person

227
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,370
if the person who's doing the vegan food

228
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,159
right and they're eating all of these

229
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,540
fun vegan foods all the time and they

230
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,070
get their first symptoms or they get

231
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,800
symptoms they think it's because they're

232
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,420
plant-based so then they leave the

233
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,040
plant-based world they leave that the u

234
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,329
n-- is immoral then they had to eating

235
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,769
animal proteins again because their

236
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,089
doctor might say it's because you don't

237
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,470
have proteins it's because you're not

238
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,390
getting your proteins not getting enough

239
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,769
proteins but maybe they weren't eating

240
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,240
as good as they could have when they're

241
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,860
eating plant-based and I say that to

242
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,560
people who are paleo too or people who

243
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,420
are doing a healthy keto maybe it could

244
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,029
be even better because that's the thing

245
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,410
we could be doing a better job in all of

246
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,910
our diets that's what I try to do right

247
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,290
I try to get the information out there

248
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,610
so it's like hey if you want to be

249
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,829
plant-based you gotta do it

250
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,230
this way make sure you get this in you

251
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,880
and she's gotta stay strong on this we

252
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,540
got our celery juices by the way we have

253
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,700
that I'm not having anymore I had two of

254
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,519
these before the live started it's

255
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:38,579
enough I need to keep the pretty face

256
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:41,910
otherwise it's a lot of celery juice

257
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:44,430
yeah but so you know and yeah it's it's

258
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,459
no matter what diet we subscribe to a

259
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:51,660
belief system we get sucked into there's

260
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,519
information out there that you know no

261
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,949
there's information about what's really

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
causing our illnesses that I'm trying to

263
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:58,230
spread out there and you're trying to

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,310
spread that information out there

265
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,019
because you're doing that you're telling

266
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,089
everybody about this information and so

267
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,760
that when you're plant-based or vegan

268
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,620
you don't get scared when you get when

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,480
you're having a symptom and you're

270
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,010
thinking it's because of lack protein or

271
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,529
it's because I'm vegan or because I'm

272
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,230
not doing something right because the

273
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,029
chase for protein that is the properties

274
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,709
for proteins and that's brilliant

275
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,199
that's brilliant well you know I I

276
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:24,510
texted you a few weeks ago telling you

277
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,940
yeah a friend of mine a close friend of

278
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,779
mine was you know having some mystery

279
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,630
weighed his shoes and it wasn't it

280
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,839
actually the doctor sent to her to kick

281
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,510
out all the fruits and all the veggies

282
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,660
and just go for the meat and the fat

283
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,149
yes that's gonna be like her healing

284
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,810
okay so just go totally totally no carb

285
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,420
no fruit yeah because because it's

286
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:56,160
qualified as sugar and sugar is you know

287
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:59,190
making her sick sick and I lost it I was

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,470
like just let's let's keep the book out

289
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,480
let's start reading and then let's see

290
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,199
and the thing is how do you go against

291
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,300
the doctor

292
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:07,740
you know like doctors are advising or

293
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,389
certain things of course first of all

294
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,570
when you see the doctor today are they

295
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,060
actually looking as we would want to

296
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,680
look you know as healthy so then they

297
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,360
also come because of course for them

298
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,940
it's like they're constantly seeing sick

299
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,230
people and trying to help them do they

300
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,029
have time to keep up with all the

301
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,040
knowledge that is out there I'm so

302
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,930
excited you partner with doctors and you

303
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,579
make sure that they also get the access

304
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,620
to that because it's so important

305
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,480
they're the ones people come to when

306
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,040
they see people in the white coats they

307
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,899
are like okay this is the person that

308
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,209
will save me and it's true they're gonna

309
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,850
save us but in some really you know

310
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:44,490
dangerous situations like broken arms

311
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,199
and you know car accidents or things

312
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,870
like that are serious serious serious

313
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,519
but then for this everyday illnesses

314
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,959
that we carry on through life this is

315
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,720
what we need this information for

316
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,480
because we're fueling our body with the

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,610
wrong fuel yeah and and I'm so happy

318
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,279
what you've mentioned in so many of your

319
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,620
books is that being repetitive with food

320
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,050
is not bad for us no everybody speaks

321
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,480
about variety changing it off spicing it

322
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,880
up right they need the variety what do

323
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,899
you say about that look like it's okay

324
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,699
if you're doing where you're not doing

325
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,010
variety where you just do something that

326
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,690
works that's another thing too I know

327
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,850
that a lot of us want variety and I

328
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,060
totally respect that not or that right

329
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,100
and and I think people get bored fast

330
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,019
and they get pressured you get pressured

331
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,880
by people around them my family might be

332
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,709
friends and are you eating those

333
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,810
potatoes again those steamed potatoes

334
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,880
again are you eating that sounds like my

335
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,860
son loves it I think I'm saying hello to

336
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,290
all the moms out there because I'm sure

337
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,839
that your kids love potatoes and I am

338
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,790
you know my son also eats them for

339
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,649
breakfast like he just likes them you

340
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,800
know and I mean okay he eats a lot of

341
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,870
fruits and then she will just go at 11

342
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,440
o'clock for potatoes and I'm not gonna

343
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,630
stop him

344
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:01,860
because I know now because I've read the

345
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:03,720
life I mean this is something that is so

346
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,490
precious to me yeah because it doesn't

347
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,930
like I love the fact that would your

348
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,880
speak when you speak about the food

349
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,590
you're not only giving this nutritional

350
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,470
fact you're actually giving the soul

351
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,300
feeding fact that every every food we

352
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,220
eat is feeding our soul - with

353
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,690
information that is so crucial that's

354
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,470
why I connect with you because you speak

355
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,660
to my soul

356
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,340
well the wild blueberries those are

357
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,870
powerful for the soul I talked about

358
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,570
that in the book oh they're really

359
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,800
powerful really healing and and that's a

360
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,360
crime and that's good for the heavy

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,950
metal detox which is I'm using from all

362
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
the recommendations you're like this

363
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,200
like the mornings the delivery rest good

364
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,330
morning are you know it's kind of an

365
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,950
intermittent fasting isn't it yeah it is

366
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,500
you know it's funny but the heavy metals

367
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,720
is people you know don't they don't

368
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,740
think they have metals in them they

369
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,850
don't think they have metals in they

370
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,260
don't think they have mercury in them

371
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,400
they don't think they have Lumina mentum

372
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,720
you guys probably hear it all the time

373
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,790
because so many of you talk about the

374
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,120
metals out there arsenic lead cadmium

375
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,890
nickel but in copper but if you have

376
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,260
eczema if you have psoriasis you have

377
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,200
your gift copper coppers inside the

378
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,740
liver if you have twitches spasms brain

379
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,390
fog tables numbness you've got mercury

380
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,860
Mercury's in there you might be viral

381
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,660
too I talk about that all times you've

382
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,040
got mercury in there so if you got all

383
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,960
of that the brain fog if you have

384
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,110
sleeping problems mercury can be behind

385
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,120
that too it could be behind so much

386
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,560
confusion the way you know if we feel

387
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,970
like we're confused if we feel like

388
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,640
we're not getting our information across

389
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,900
we can't see we can't talk so clearly or

390
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,930
we can't think or we're getting the

391
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:37,950
brain fog in the way in your home like -

392
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,010
because that was something that I've

393
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:44,370
just a few months ago discovered when we

394
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:47,220
were our chef that was cooking for us at

395
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,750
that time was you know wrapping the food

396
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,330
in the aluminium foil

397
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,160
yes warm to keep it warm yeah and I had

398
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,410
the massive food poisoning without even

399
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,880
you know understanding why it was you

400
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,700
know and then when I realized that it

401
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,620
was the aluminium that was and we use it

402
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,030
every single day I grew up around like

403
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,860
my

404
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,690
I don't know my cousins were working in

405
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,750
a factory that was doing that you know

406
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,970
we taking that matter exactly and so all

407
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,250
of us are getting sick from all the you

408
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,550
know everyday use of shampoos and

409
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,520
lotions and perfumes and all different

410
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,530
kinds of things what I you know blows my

411
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,330
mind is the idea of going to the shop

412
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,700
and buying your new clothes and putting

413
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,230
them on and you are also poisoning your

414
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,120
body with that because somebody has used

415
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,830
a mold spray or something on it yeah

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,380
they use a fungicide all our new clothes

417
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,970
that we get oh we go out my new clothes

418
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,410
they spray it with fungicide they don't

419
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,070
give you the choice there's no town hall

420
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,070
meeting

421
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,350
there's no choices there or not we're

422
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,630
not giving that they just they just coat

423
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,670
everything with fungicide fungicide is

424
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,950
so toxic it goes to the brain it's

425
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,710
filled with metals and so that's what we

426
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,320
live in all of this stuff every day so

427
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,420
sure I mean we're battling where the

428
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,670
diet people are all fighting each other

429
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,830
you got like Paquito people are all mad

430
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,150
at the people who do a potato and and

431
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,220
you got the people you mean the vegans

432
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,840
are mad at the beet eater people and you

433
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,420
got all everybody's throwing all this

434
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,460
science at each other all these studies

435
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,050
all this what I call fake science but

436
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,640
nobody knows the cause of illnesses

437
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,330
nobody knows that when they buy new

438
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,090
clothes

439
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,350
it's loaded with fungicide nobody knows

440
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,670
that they're supposed to lower their

441
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,290
fats because they're taking out their

442
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,700
oxygen and because their oxygen is

443
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,170
getting you know less and less in the

444
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,820
body to fight disease so they're eating

445
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,800
all these high fats and all these diets

446
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,090
nobody knows any of this information so

447
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,530
then everybody stays sick they're all

448
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,940
getting sick so you might be vegan for a

449
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,440
little why it might be keto for a little

450
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,210
while you might be paleo for a little

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,430
while you might be doing some diet and

452
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:42,260
you're feeling good for a while go back

453
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,760
to the five years later you know you're

454
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,410
you might be doing on YouTube you're

455
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,790
doing youtubes for years ago and you can

456
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,760
follow the progression that four years

457
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,920
later everybody gets better from it and

458
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,900
then gets worse like I don't understand

459
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,250
it like so many times you do something

460
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,680
that is so good for you and you feel

461
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,940
good and you commit to it but then I

462
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,190
guess you have to take into

463
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,170
consideration if your body's changing

464
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,060
well there's a couple of things to when

465
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,060
we usually jump into something we're

466
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,410
usually eating worse before that so for

467
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,939
instance like if you go to a healthy

468
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,500
keto diet after being you know eating

469
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,269
whatever or more you know you're eating

470
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,490
more fast food or you're eating no

471
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:19,379
process you don't see the diet is the

472
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,000
new kind of high-protein diet but

473
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:22,889
everybody gets mad if I say I protein

474
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,779
because it's high fat and that's the

475
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:26,939
whole thing but it's really it's really

476
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,959
a lot of fat but the high protein diet

477
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,210
is a lot of fat

478
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,980
they're basically they're both filled

479
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,110
with a lot of fat vegan diet is also

480
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,600
high fat it's nice that yeah - that's

481
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:40,370
why there's keto vegan now but the yeah

482
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,690
but the keto diets is the high fat diet

483
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,059
yeah the cute guys the high fat diet

484
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,200
that's still high protein but and then

485
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,570
you know but you got the high protein

486
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,009
diet that's still high fat and then you

487
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,389
got the key you got the vegan diets that

488
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:53,490
are still high fat and all of this

489
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,169
delivery suffers deliver suffering see

490
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,000
the keto diet high fat or liver

491
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,740
suffering you do high protein diet high

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,110
fat your livers suffering you do you can

493
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,120
package it name it anything you want but

494
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,710
they all end up high fat diets they kill

495
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,600
the liver the liver gets killed you

496
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,580
knock down but people get better at

497
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,960
first because they're lowering they're

498
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,340
staying away from their chocolate cake

499
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,100
they're staying away from their waffles

500
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,950
they're staying away for their joy

501
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,200
things like I mean you get stress from

502
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,700
all this information like now knowing

503
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,850
that everything you do everything you

504
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,259
use it becomes so toxic for you so now

505
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,639
there is a moment of panic right

506
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,129
everybody's like oh my god but if this

507
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:31,409
is how do I actually live this life and

508
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:33,299
who do I trust and I mean so often

509
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,190
people say but in this organic section

510
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,070
there is like not a lot nice and looking

511
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,500
fruit or veggie and it all looks very

512
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,799
you know it's not appealing to people

513
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,529
yeah so they give up before even they

514
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,450
started because it's just not as yummy

515
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:51,509
looking as that strawberry that is like

516
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,120
this big or you know and so you were

517
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:55,710
stuck with this fear because now all of

518
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,990
a sudden knowing what's causing your

519
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,659
illness is the new creating fear in you

520
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,970
yeah and you are providing us with this

521
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,190
information and giving us alternatives I

522
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,399
love the idea of knowing that I can have

523
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,860
you know a piece of fruit in 300 ways

524
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:13,470
you know if well people are afraid of

525
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,929
fruit there's fruit fear Oh big fruit

526
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,519
fear out there big like big so eating

527
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,409
all my life fruit more than anything

528
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,730
else honestly it has given me life

529
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,919
anything else I've been doing maybe not

530
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,230
well what happens is the fruit fear is a

531
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,299
funny thing because if someone gets sick

532
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,340
they don't blame the egg that's fed

533
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,440
every virus and pathogen and bacteria

534
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,600
that causes their problems and they

535
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,279
don't blame the egg but they'll blame

536
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,289
the piece of fruit they have no one

537
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,289
really ate fruit so why is everybody

538
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:44,419
sick no one eats enough fruit and for

539
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:48,070
anyone even determined fruits the reason

540
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,070
why they're sick it's not even possible

541
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:57,169
isn't healthier I wish it was but it'll

542
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,749
still feed every bug in our body so the

543
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,309
cause of illness are pathogens and

544
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:03,080
toxins so you got the viruses of

545
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,669
bacteria that's your pathogens and then

546
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,799
you got the toxins and everybody has a

547
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,450
minim and it's it's like Russian

548
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,039
Roulette it's like it's like again it's

549
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,659
like a gamble who's gonna get sick first

550
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,399
who's gonna get knocked down and have

551
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,499
the pathogen take over and give them

552
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,629
aches and pains and fatigue and all

553
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:19,220
kinds of problems and or what Thompson's

554
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:20,809
are people gonna get intoxicated with

555
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,359
like what metals and what different

556
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,830
kinds of poisons like the you know all

557
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,350
the different fungicide on clothes and

558
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,789
the petrochemicals out there floating in

559
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,309
the air and the mercury that's falling

560
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,109
out of the sky so we get both the toxins

561
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:34,909
so we get both the pathogens and then

562
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,769
they both get they join together the

563
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,330
pathogens eat the poisons and then we

564
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,460
get sick and then everybody blames the

565
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,980
strawberry everybody's going to blame

566
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,100
the strawberry a very food that will

567
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,129
actually help you get better everybody's

568
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,690
going to blame it suggest more people

569
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:52,730
who want to change their life because

570
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,499
it's all about working out as well no I

571
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,879
think people want to lose weight or

572
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:58,190
people want to feel bad you know I've

573
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:01,129
been doing this for 35 years maybe more

574
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:04,249
than 35 years now and I've seen guys

575
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:06,379
that are like in top shape top shape die

576
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:08,450
of heart attacks just boom that's it 38

577
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:10,519
years old they're in the gym they got

578
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,619
their tabs they got their apps I know a

579
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,509
lot of athletes I've helped a lot of

580
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:17,330
athletes professionally over the decades

581
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:19,489
and you can just you get one injury that

582
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,529
won't heal you get you get something and

583
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,330
you know you get a heart attack or

584
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,919
something happens but there's there's

585
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,149
ways to heal things there ways that will

586
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,679
avoid that there's a way to heal

587
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:29,269
injuries the way that you know do the

588
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,220
body can heal but you got to give it

589
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,409
what it needs you got to give it what it

590
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,929
needs how do we know what our body needs

591
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:40,190
for a particular thing like say

592
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:42,080
or feel like I love the item I keep on

593
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,320
speaking about it but honestly for me

594
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,850
your books are really important guides

595
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,610
so for instance when we have an injury

596
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,129
when we for instance injured our knee

597
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,600
and that's an injury that's gonna heal

598
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,740
at some point right with all the

599
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,019
different things you're doing your

600
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,730
therapy and stuff and then after a while

601
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:01,159
it's gonna come back again and it flares

602
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,740
up when we are eating inflammatory foods

603
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,899
yeah so that's the weak point for now

604
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,909
forever in our body and that's where the

605
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:10,129
viruses and bacteria are collecting and

606
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,190
nesting when we when we injure ourselves

607
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:15,740
and we have a pathogen in us we have say

608
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,549
like a virus in us I've seen bar we

609
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,590
injure ourselves

610
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,999
the virus can go to that injury that's

611
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,740
why there's so many people there's

612
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:23,240
people who get knee surgeries and they

613
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,440
get up and they walk out they're fine

614
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,970
right after the knee surgery that

615
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,769
literally I talk to doctors all the time

616
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,840
about this they just get it they walk

617
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,899
same pertinent this other person gets

618
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,330
the same exact surgery same exactly

619
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:36,619
problem to the T everything should be

620
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,980
fine they should be up and walking

621
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:41,809
bright out and then they're swollen for

622
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,090
weeks and weeks and months and months

623
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:45,590
and now on steroids and swollen and they

624
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,570
can't walk good they need long-term

625
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,419
physical therapy and it goes on a year

626
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,129
of a knee problem because they had a

627
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:54,470
low-grade viral infection in their

628
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:57,110
system but we're do are you suggesting

629
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,659
for them like I know for instance my dad

630
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,549
when he had this injury that kept coming

631
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:03,710
back he would they were suggesting him

632
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:05,389
to use the collagen is that a good thing

633
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,179
or not really well you can't build up

634
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:10,610
your collagen by eating collagen you

635
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,860
can't no you can't fix your kidney by

636
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:16,789
eating a kidney you can't fix your eye

637
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,379
by eating an eye you can't you can't fix

638
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,419
your liver by eating a liver and you

639
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:23,529
can't fix your skin by eating skin you

640
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:28,159
can are you listening are you listening

641
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:29,809
collagen that he swears to God about it

642
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,519
like I feel like people generally

643
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,259
attached themselves to the solutions

644
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,809
that are not really solutions you need

645
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:38,590
phytochemical compounds that are like

646
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:42,679
for example in celery juice to create

647
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:45,830
collagen collagen is created by our body

648
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,899
it's created through fighting chemical

649
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,940
compounds mineral salts and other things

650
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:51,220
like that

651
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,530
that's what creates collagen lots of

652
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,020
antioxidants from like blueberries lots

653
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,210
of man you can't eat something to create

654
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,490
something that's that's actually that's

655
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,600
a thousand years ago that was the Dark

656
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:08,530
Ages with a C vitamin because we have to

657
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,750
you know drink C vitamin or eight those

658
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,420
are minerals and vitamins nutrients

659
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,160
that's what we use to create things so

660
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,070
we use vitamin C to create our immune

661
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,260
system we use we use minerals to create

662
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,990
tissue in cells we use all of this

663
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,970
creates but you can't you can't take

664
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,680
something like collagen that's actually

665
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,320
in our skin but you can't take a

666
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,580
collagen source another source of

667
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,590
collagen whatever that might be

668
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,450
consume it and think it's gonna go to

669
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,980
the skin all it's going to do is go into

670
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,360
your stomach and out your intestinal

671
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,190
tract then you go to bathroom and it

672
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,930
goes out and that's where it goes you

673
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,850
can't find its way to your skin it's

674
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,680
like it's like eating a sheep's eyeball

675
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,170
to try to fix your eyeball or something

676
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,510
it's like eating yes you know even

677
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,370
kidneys it's people you can be kidney

678
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,980
pie but that's what the kids were eating

679
00:24:51,370 --> 00:25:01,690
in my country we were growing up it was

680
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:03,520
a liver and you know there's supplements

681
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,840
out there with actual baby I don't know

682
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,160
if they're still out there now I haven't

683
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,660
been looking at these varieties of

684
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,930
supplements but some of us out there

685
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,900
would bringing in it with brain so in

686
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,580
order to fix your brain and so you're

687
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,140
gonna eat brain supplements to fix your

688
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,960
brain it doesn't work like that see but

689
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,930
for some reason we can we get tricked by

690
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,730
propaganda by money by investments and

691
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,230
those investments going to collagen it's

692
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,070
such an easy sell like wait a minute my

693
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,900
skin will get better

694
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,000
collagen collagen let me tell you

695
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,800
something when you have the worst eczema

696
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,050
the worst eczema effort you can gobble

697
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,820
all the collagen shakes you want and you

698
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,710
can take all the collagen pills you want

699
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,570
you can buy into it and spend thousands

700
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,450
of dollars on collagen every other month

701
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,600
and your skin will even not only stay

702
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,880
the same you get so excited these things

703
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,710
but you know we need people like you to

704
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,600
speak to all of us because we've wanted

705
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,040
to live a good life but it's just well

706
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,930
you know what it is I'm not I'm not

707
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,070
afraid of whose feelings I'm gonna hurt

708
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,870
in the industries and that's what

709
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,000
happens see everybody else there they

710
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,870
got their afraid you know don't don't

711
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,299
hurt that

712
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,039
don't hurt that guy you know and really

713
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,350
it you gotta protect the people who

714
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,029
struggle and suffer you got it and you

715
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,980
got and it doesn't matter if anybody's

716
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:13,990
gonna you know water roast me like they

717
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,620
do all the time and that's what happens

718
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,150
we all know that I get I get hit more

719
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,220
than anybody else in the industry

720
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,220
because you can't make money off of

721
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,770
celery juice so I'm a threat see this is

722
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,179
actually healing people so it threatens

723
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,070
the industries because they can't

724
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:38,860
bankroll off of this this is the one

725
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:41,620
this is this is rogue knowledge you're

726
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,480
providing I'm sure sure so there's a lot

727
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,640
of silence out there you can find in

728
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,220
juice bars now the celery juice just not

729
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,320
HPP one maybe just go for your fresh one

730
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,880
but not a lot of money's made from that

731
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,179
but the bigger industries like the

732
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,980
college industry millions and millions

733
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:59,140
of billions of dollars now it's a good

734
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,000
trick it's a great trick because I'm

735
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,860
using the good supplements you were

736
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,549

737
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,899

out of your skin because that's what it

743
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,360

760
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,429
best one to do okay that's what my kids

anybody out there wants to do pasta do

763
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,850
the lentil pasta the red lentil pasta is

764
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:07,330
even better yeah that's what I would do

765
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,570
and the red lentils Percy that's also

766
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,429
absolutely food that our bloating us

767
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,320
come on that's a big thing out there

768
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:17,080
everybody's complaining hoping there be

769
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,360
bloated to everything when I get bloated

770
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,850
when my skinny you know I look like I'm

771
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,710

really bloated

774
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:30,070
when people are bloated they're like you

gonna happen but um but you know what

778
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,230
happens is the reason why people are

779
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,669
bloating because their liver stagnant

780
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,039
and sluggish that's what happens

781
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:46,059

liver for everything everybody blames me

783
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,990

basically I was trying to be the

806
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,080
healthiest I can be and knowing that

807
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,480
there is a little human being inside of

808
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,250
me I wanted to create this perfect

809
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,960
environment for him when we live in this

810
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:54,700
sick world we are bombed with all these

811
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,710

gonna make us happier and better and

813
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,049
healthier and so when I started

814
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,059
researching a lot on the what I can eat

815
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,830
so that I can when I'm producing milk

816
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:10,059
for my son he gets the best out of it

817
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:12,039
and and I've turned plant-based or vegan

818
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:14,350
well back then I was vegan and I was

819
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:18,129
very very like hardcore

820
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:20,559
on that and and that's what helped me

821
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:23,799
understand and what did I like why would

822
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,360
he what was the the idea about why did I

823
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,909
start talking about this now I love my

824
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,599

everything as you're telling story

831
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:48,029
because you became the plant based and

832
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,259

recognize that because what we're doing

847
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,419
right now requires lots of energy like

848
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,099
I'm shaking from the excitement but he's

849
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,409
been doing this every single day and

850
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,909
writing books and sleeping two hours

851
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,729
maybe in the night just to make sure

852
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:32,070
that he refreshes and he is able to look

853
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:34,529
like this thanks to all the wonderful

854
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,809
knowledge who gets from you know the

855
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:40,139
source and the wonderful spirit that I'm

856
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,210
connected to too so yeah what you're

857
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,340
doing is just something that has

858
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,779
connected with me in so many levels and

859
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:51,269
give me the cry right here so I guess I

860
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:53,549
got a hold it back but that's the side

861
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,710
of you people have to see because really

862
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:58,229
the commitment you you give for this

863
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,700
like I generally you know you get sick

864
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:02,039
from people telling you they're sick oh

865
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,049
I'm feeling her pain here and there and

866
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,489
you know I'm every day waking up with

867
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,190
this and then we all get sick from that

868
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:11,039
and he gets to listen it and practically

869
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,989
and with so much attention and gives the

870
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,940
solution to people this is something

871
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:16,799
that not you don't get in them you know

872
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,169
doctor's office unfortunately you get a

873
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,309
prescription which is just gonna delay

874
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:25,529
another you know what walking delay

875
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,359
yeah I could put sickness on hold a

876
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,489
little bit but it gets routed deeper

877
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,129
inside yeah but this is the information

878
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:34,679
that actually gets you back on track and

879
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:36,330
gives you the the time for you to to

880
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,489
reset yourself and go back in the

881
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,140
driving seat and that's how I feel in my

882
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,570
life

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,690
liking those stories I mean I do make

906
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,860
them funny but some kids do cry from

907
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,660
those stories so it's it's it's it's an

908
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,610
interesting journey I love the idea of

909
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,380
teaching my kids from early on and not

910
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,150
only my kids but all the kids that we

911
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,919
touch through the foundation how they

912
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,799
can take care of themselves you know how

913
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,059
they can start this life and live it

914
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,640
despite everything that is around us

915
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,080
because that's not what makes us

916
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,880
unhealthy it's our choices that we make

917
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,160
we have a choice every single day to

918
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,929
choose the right thing to do for us in

919
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,270
the planet and that's what you've

920
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,919
provided us like I haven't found this

921
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,260
knowledge in many books and I've read a

922
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,119
lot of books on health this is these are

923
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,800
the books I come back to and I will

924
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,300
forever be grateful for what you're

925
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,600
doing I'm honored you know the

926
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,210
information in the books is it's not out

927
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,190
there it only comes from this source so

928
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,409
it's not like it's repackaged it's funny

929
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,510
because the health books of today and

930
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:29,119
I'm not trying to say that they're not

931
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,550
helpful it's just that it's the same

932
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,740
stuff but it's repackaged for the next

933
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,270
generation of basically people who start

934
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,190
getting health minded when whether

935
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,750
they're in their 20s or whether they're

936
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,190
in their 30s or when they're just

937
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,230
starting to get health mind it and

938
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,790
they're getting excited and they get

939
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,899
they get the books out there and they

940
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,609
get the information out there and they

941
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,109
read articles and they don't know that

942
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,900
that information was the same

943
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:52,850
information that was repackaged ten

944
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,410
go to the crowd before them and then 10

945
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,240
years ago to the crowd before them like

946
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,640
for instance he got the whole candida

947
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,500
thing that happened for 30-40 years now

948
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,200
they switched it to microbiome but it's

949
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,660
still the same package but they renamed

950
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,310
it and then then the newer generation

951
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,080
kind of comes up and they don't realize

952
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,090
that the answers aren't in there yet and

953
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,130
if they get too sick they'll find that

954
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,440
the answers aren't really there and

955
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,900
that's what happens it's like so you

956
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,330
know it's it's it depends on how sick a

957
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,580
person gets to realize and I noticed

958
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:24,590
that the older people who've been there

959
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,780
done that they've seen all the tricks

960
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,550
and games they've seen the decades of

961
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,800
tricks and games and they realize things

962
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,480
are repackaged so when they find this

963
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,980
information and we wait a minute this

964
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,160
was different than anything else that

965
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,440
exists out there the rest is repackaged

966
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,180
backed by money put out there and it's

967
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:49,490
still it's not getting people to that

968
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:51,950
next level of where they need to go and

969
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,440
everybody swear to it and there was this

970
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,930
just recent article I feel like it was a

971
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,420
maybe half an year half a year ago where

972
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:06,110
they published the information about the

973
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:09,260
coconut oil being toxic carcinogenic and

974
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:11,660
so you know you are you're everybody's

975
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,870
drinking coconut water coconut oil you

976
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:18,230
know putting on their face or or their

977
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,760
food and frying stuff with it and now

978
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,800
all of a sudden that's wrong and then

979
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:31,430
you're like where should I go to for all

980
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:33,560
the information and how do I you know I

981
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:37,550
remember texting you many times asking

982
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,620
you how much fat is too much fat like

983
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,380
and can we actually live without the

984
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:45,440
fact because it's in avocado for

985
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:48,800
instance everybody's been dying with the

986
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,110
fat mm-hmm we just decade after decade

987
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,310
after decade everybody's dying with the

988
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:56,750
fat so everybody is on fat just

989
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,480
everybody's on it doesn't matter you

990
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,640
know Megan's I'm not but you know what

991
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,450
but it's still good to have a little you

992
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,009
can have

993
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,630
I'm going your way a little bit of that

994
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,829
Mikado you can have some coconut oil if

995
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,269
you're into fish you can have some sort

996
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,880
of age you can have some really good

997
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:13,410
high quality fats if you're into animal

998
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,390
products you go for the highest quality

999
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,700
but if you go for bacon or pork you're

1000
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,499
into the bad fat now but let me tell you

1001
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,690
the bad I'm a very strong advocate for

1002
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:24,630
clan-based so I wouldn't you know you're

1003
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,700
all plant-based your plan I'm not I mean

1004
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,499
you're so kind to speak about it in such

1005
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,410
way this is you do know that people are

1006
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:34,619
enjoying meat I love my meat you're hard

1007
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,450
at work plant it was like because you

1008
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,190
know there is not many I respect that

1009
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,069
though because I've seen plant-based

1010
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,160
diets literally take people out of the

1011
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:46,859
depths of hell with their health

1012
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,739
literally worse and pull them out of it

1013
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:51,359
I've seen it pull them out of it

1014
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:53,729
absolutely but the right people are like

1015
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,619
saying okay now I'm feeling better so

1016
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:58,229
I'm just gonna go back to what it was

1017
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,509
before right so the plan based diet is

1018
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:02,849
mainly to get you out of the you know

1019
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:04,589
hole and then you go back to your meat

1020
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,660
until you go back again in the hole and

1021
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:09,479
then you go back to that so there's a

1022
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,089
some maintenance diet yeah but it is a

1023
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:13,559
maintenance diet he should be it is no

1024
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:16,019
you can be plant-based anybody out there

1025
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,190
plant-based I mean raise your hand

1026
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,829
yep raise your hand if you're planning

1027
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,809
to that yeah it's a powerful way to heal

1028
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,640
stick to it you know if you're something

1029
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:25,680
that you don't want to do plant based on

1030
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,420
some other kicking everything lower your

1031
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,979
fats but I tell people plant-based down

1032
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,630
lower your fats you know that's the

1033
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:33,150
thing is is I'm all about whatever

1034
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,710
wherever you are with your diet you got

1035
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,940
to bring your fats down because that's

1036
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,739
where you'll get in trouble every time

1037
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,440
maybe you're not gonna get your curves

1038
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:47,400
you know because those magazines and

1039
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:50,130
popular places are actually it's like we

1040
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,869
could offer Kings really both of us we

1041
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:56,400
have two chairs moving probably sit in

1042
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:57,869
one and we do feel good I mean this is

1043
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,640
like this is what we're talking about

1044
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,950
actually feeling good rather than

1045
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,329
looking good and I know there are so

1046
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,460
many people out there who want to feel

1047
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:07,619
good and there are ways and it's just

1048
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,450
well no I I could go into the gym I

1049
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,729
could go into gym three hours a day

1050
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,580
we're doing some muscle maybe I should

1051
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,050
go in the gym do

1052
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,370
three hours they start building muscle

1053
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,530
maybe I'll go and get some massages

1054
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,060
everyday maybe I'll go and do yoga for

1055
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,410
two hours day and I won't be able to

1056
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,230
help anybody because I'll be too busy

1057
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,150
taking care of myself but in doing all

1058
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:28,900
that so forget right in the books the

1059
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,730
writing the book sleeps two hours a day

1060
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,090
so he can provide all the knowledge to

1061
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:36,010
us so sorry I've had people I've had

1062
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,660

it's really difficult for everybody and

1077
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,290

1081
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,100
that's what you're doing but I can't

1082
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,190
make that my life I can't be putting on

1083
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,140
iron you know Lena I gotta just you know

1084
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,900
stay toned I gotta stay healthy you know

1085
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:27,150
sure just ride my bike well where did I

1086
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:30,430
read you're like 28 year older than 20

1087
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:33,370
been doing this for 35 years and I'm 28

1088
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,400
no it's true they say I'm 28 because I

1089
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:38,140
look so old when you're 28 I think it's

1090
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,180
done I think it's out there on the

1091
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,460
Internet I remember that I asked you

1092
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,040
that like how do you stay so young and

1093
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,600
and then it's like what what is it was

1094
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,770
just so confusing obviously there are

1095
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,910
lots of lies out there and there are

1096
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,180
people who are trying to discredit

1097
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,370
people doing good stuff and and I feel

1098
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,320
for me the most thing the thing that

1099
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,720
connects me is this soul feeling like

1100
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,700
this inside of me feeling I don't

1101
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,340
connect too many things out there like

1102
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,020
that but I did to you and through your

1103
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:09,250
books because you're a spoken word I

1104
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,560
mean those you know to our nights are

1105
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,300
like really paying off I mean they

1106
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,550
touched me and people who are following

1107
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,460
me and for not only me but my family

1108
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,920
they're gonna you know also be connected

1109
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,990
to that I'm sure and for for every

1110
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,850
