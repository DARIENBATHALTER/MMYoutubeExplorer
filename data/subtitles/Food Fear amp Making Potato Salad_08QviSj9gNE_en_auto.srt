1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
making a potato salad right here

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,779
I'm making a potato salad I got all

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,160
kinds of good stuff right here I feel

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,620
like eating that for dinner tonight

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
talking about food fear as well and

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,820
we're day six of the collecting Stones

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,980
meditation Journey

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,039
and I see that everybody was sketching

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,740
their stones that is such an incredible

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,640
moment when I remember when I was

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,619
sketching my Stones how it felt and what

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,840
it does it really connects you to what's

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,420
in the stone like all the nooks and

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
crannies and all the crevices and all

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,399
the different lines and designs and the

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,739
mineral compositions and everything is

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,379
there you really get to know your Stones

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,260
when you're sketching them like it's a

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,260
whole another level of being intimate

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,079
with your Stones which is really a part

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,780
of this incredible exercise and healing

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,480
Journey seven day healing Journey so

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,219
today is day six we're getting close I

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,600
wanted to make a potato salad talk a

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,280
little bit about food fear and stuff

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,180
like that which is fun we'll just see

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,040
you

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,900
we'll see we'll cover a couple different

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
things because I know so many people are

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,380
so afraid of so many different things

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
because they've been trained and

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,900
conditioned and brainwashed out there

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,140
in such a way stay away from nightshades

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,259
stay away from oxalates stay away from

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,299
uh lectins stay away from this and it

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,979
throws you in a big spin a confusion

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,479
because it's like what do I eat and

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,400
every and then you go to a food

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,740
allergist and now you're out of another

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,380
food allergist and they're like oh stay

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,040
off of this this don't eat kumquats

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,520
don't eat right don't eat limes don't

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
eat cilantro don't eat lemongrass like

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,420
the craziest stuff like you got this

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,960
list that's this big and and it's like

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,759
but you can eat meat and you can eat

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,259
this oh you're allergic to avocado

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,299
you're allergic to this you're allergic

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,100
to that it's crazy how that works so

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,100
many people have been totally brain

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,259
screwed really bad by that

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,240
for so many years because here you are

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,219
you're looking for help but nobody knows

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,860
why you're sick they don't know why you

55
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,679
actually have your symptoms your Tremors

56
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,480
in your hands and your achy feet and

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,120
your body that feels like you have

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,819
sandbags it's bogging you down and

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,739
holding you down where you have fatigue

60
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,420
where you have brain fog that's making

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,099
it so when someone talks to you you

62
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,780
can't even talk you can't even answer

63
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,540
them like you feel like you didn't even

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,280
get your words out right and there's all

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,440
that and there's plus there's OCD and

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,879
depression anxiety there's confusion

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,580
there's all kinds of different things

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,379
that people go through there's panic

69
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,120
attacks there's different levels of

70
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,700
anxiety there's neurological symptoms

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Galore that people have tightness in the

72
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,560
chest tighten it you know funny feelings

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,500
in the stomach and aches in their jaw

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
and pain in their neck and it just goes

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,760
on and on and on and then you go and

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,580
you're looking for help and you got this

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,500
guy and he's like hey uh yeah we just

78
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,379

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,500
whatever I mean they'll just come up

82
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,739
with anything don't eat this this this

83
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,239
this this stay away from stay away from

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,760
this herb stay away from this spice

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,420
don't have turmeric and don't have

86
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,640
parsley in this whole list gets insane

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,060
and here's what's crazy

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,599
the craziest part of this back 10 years

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,099
ago 10 years ago you go to the and do

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,440
all those different food elimination

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,379
tests 10 years ago

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,019
and it was different than what they're

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:39,060
saying eliminate now when you go and do

94
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,099
it because

95
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,200
the tests have always been and

96
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,959
the reason why is that they go with the

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,420
trends that's how crazy it is it's like

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,980
10 years ago they say oh you're allergic

99
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,239
to this this this to almost everybody

100
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,159
like and then as a few years go by and

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,959
Trends start changing people are allowed

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,580
to eat more fruit because medical meme

103
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,140
broke the fruit fear

104
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,580
and people are eating more fruit and

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,200
stuff and now those tests are coming

106
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,700
back for a lot of people and oh that's

107
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,459
allowed that's allowed that's allowed oh

108
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,299
what happens why is the test morphing

109
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,680
shape-shifting into into the trend of

110
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,260
the times I mean you're talking about

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,239
like psycho that's psycho it's really

112
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,919
crazy how it works anyway

113
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm making a potato salad with the scary

114
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,699
nightshades

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,740
the scary night shades so that's what

116
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,660
we're doing and what do I have here I

117
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,580
have a bunch of little things lemon whoa

118
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,860
watch out lemon will kill your teeth

119
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,380
don't have any lemon you won't have a

120
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,020
tooth left you'll be toothless if you

121
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,120
eat any lemon God forbid you squeeze

122
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,100
lemon on something oh don't have your

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,660
lemon water every dentist will tell you

124
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,060
that's why your teeth are falling out

125
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,680
really because there's a crap ton of

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,600
people on this planet that are in dental

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,639
chairs getting their teeth rolled and

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,820
they're not doing lemon water that's

129
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,660
amazing how it works that's how crazy it

130
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,180
is

131
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,620
food fear is the topic but we're on day

132
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,080
six of the collecting Stones meditation

133
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,780
Journey we're sketching Stones today

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,940
Renata says yeah earlier today I saw a

135
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,280
thread of women talking about doctors

136
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,320
recommending limiting fruit always but

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,199
especially in pregnancy and especially

138
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,820
in the final trimester yeah stay away

139
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,540
from fruit because you're pregnant

140
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,060
that's food fear it's also fruit fear I

141
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,520
mean how crazy is that don't eat an

142
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,740
apple because you're pregnant huh

143
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,720
exactly and that's the kind of stuff

144
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,039
that's happening out there so much food

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,900
Theory you know what's happening right

146
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,400
now it's like everywhere whether it's

147
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,020
tick tock or anywhere else it's like

148
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,960
everybody's trying to get a rise out of

149
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,060
somebody like know this know that know

150
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,160
this know that it's the trend now know

151
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,380
this no that no this no that no this

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,300
right nobody knows why anybody's sick

153
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,460
but that's the trend now too it's like

154
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,400
food fear Galore out there

155
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,440
is what I call it anyway

156
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Melissa says I drew my stones and it

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,539
looks like three potatoes that's pretty

158
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,180
funny it's all right I actually Drew my

159
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,440
stones and it looked like three lumps of

160
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,259
coal

161
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,600
that's what it looks like right there

162
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,520
and um

163
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,080
look there's Michelle says some of us

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,060
have food fear because we really do

165
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,100
react though yes totally but I wasn't

166
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,840
talking about that and I wasn't talking

167
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,940
about that situation I'm talking about

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,860
people they're sick they don't know why

169
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,380
they're sick they're just eating

170
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,759
whatever but you know and then they fall

171
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,620
into the alternative you know

172
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,360
communities and they get told stay away

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,979
from an oxalate then they get told they

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,440
don't even know it's gonna stay away

175
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,000
from a lectin stay away from celery stay

176
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,940
away from this stay away from that it's

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,380
endless endless uh endless that

178
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,759
so anyway

179
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,680
an IG

180
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,960
but the carbs and potatoes makes your

181
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,160
body produce insulin and that's how you

182
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,100
become obese and cause inflammation I

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,979
wish that was accurate information but

184
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,639
it's not accurate information

185
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,680
carbs in potatoes don't you know make

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,740
you obese that's not how it works

187
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,419
insulin resistance is when you're eating

188
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,100
too much fat so everybody's eating too

189
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,380
much fat they get insulin resistance

190
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,180
that's how it works that's why when you

191
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,639
take somebody who has Type 2 diabetes

192
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,340
and you start removing fried greasy food

193
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,380
out of their diet their numbers start to

194
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,300
level out a little better and better and

195
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,580
improve the reason why is because

196
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,680
they're removing hunks of fat out of

197
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,960
their diet they're taking them out of

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,240
fried Foodland which is the highest fat

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,639
where it's fried foods it's the highest

200
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,800
level of fat in your diet and when they

201
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,680
start removing the fried greasy fried

202
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,300
foods all of a sudden they're type 2 the

203
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,160
numbers are a little bit better and the

204
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,740
doctor's like whoa things are looking a

205
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
little better the more fat you rid out

206
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,580
of your diet the numbers come down and

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,319
you get even better if you're type 2

208
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,880
diabetes or you got diabetes your

209
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,460
numbers even get better and better and

210
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,800
better insulin resistance is all the fat

211
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,900
not allowing the glucose which is what

212
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,960
you need to survive to get to where it

213
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,759
needs to go so your pancreas has to

214
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,199
produce all this insulin the insulin

215
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,780
just floats around in your bloodstream

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,259
that's the reality like that's real

217
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,720
information what you have is outdated BS

218
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,120
information completely wrong across the

219
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,460
board where you're saying a potato can

220
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,039
actually make you obese no that's not

221
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,800
how it works but guess what though a

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,000
potato loaded with oil fat cheese butter

223
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,060
sour cream

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,800
and whatever else on top that's not

225
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,779
going to help you because guess what

226
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,640
it's the cheese that makes you fat guess

227
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:43,200
what it's the cheese it's the butter

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,959
it's the sour cream it's all that on top

229
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,899
like that's the stuff right there you

230
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,760
want to eat all that fat yeah that's

231
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,440
gonna push you over the edge push your

232
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,660
liver over the edge and push you in a

233
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,580
bad place so here we go let's talk about

234
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,440
the collecting Stones meditation Journey

235
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,300
a little bit sketching Stones is what we

236
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,519
were doing today we're talking about

237
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,240
food fearing and out of it

238
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:09,920
but let's start making a salad

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
so I got a bowl right here

240
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,300
and what I'll do is I think I'll place

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,300
it right here for the moment let me chop

242
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,820
up some greens let me get some lettuce

243
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,560
going here's some gorgeous lettuce right

244
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,380
here can I show this to you guys right

245
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,360
here it's a green leaf lettuce

246
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,360
there it is you guys see

247
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,839
I'm gonna chop some of it up I'm not

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,899
gonna make it so fine and I'm not going

249
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,459
to make pieces too too big either not

250
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,860
going to do that either so it's going to

251
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,060
be like in between

252
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,740
I think that's actually pretty good

253
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,740
right there pop that in here

254
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,820
so I'm making a quick potato salad

255
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,920
I might have chopped that up a little

256
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,920
too a little too fine there there we go

257
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,240
getting some lettuce together

258
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
how many of you guys been down the road

259
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,440
of food beer

260
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,480
scared to death of oxalates scared to

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,580
death of a lectin scared to death of a

262
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,980
potato a Nightshade don't know where

263
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,180
you're going the whole Health industry

264
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,940
had demonized sugar to such a point when

265
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,220
we need sugar it's what runs our brain

266
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,839
and muscles you have to have sugar why

267
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,060
do you think the carnivore people where

268
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,060
they were experimenting and they were

269
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,240
just doing eating muscle meat and eggs

270
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,459
and organ meats and then guess what see

271
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,140
you later alligator

272
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,399
so I'm chopping up some lettuce right

273
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,360
here

274
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,360
getting in here

275
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,920
making a salad

276
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,000
guys hold on one second here

277
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,200
one of my stones

278
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,779
one of my Stones right here

279
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,959
but I think I have my other Stones too I

280
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,959
will find them they're temporarily lost

281
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,980
here we go

282
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,279
Tyler lion says just out of the shower

283
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,880
with my Stones just in time for mm live

284
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,279
just in time

285
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,720
your Stones probably feel nice and fresh

286
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:33,060
freshly washed Dr fun I drew I drew my

287
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,620
Stones they look sketchy

288
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,779
indeed

289
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,480
I believe that I believe that

290
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,940
it's like the carnivore people right

291
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,160
check this out

292
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,620
they start out where I'm just gonna eat

293
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
meat only this isn't about anti-meat

294
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,640
this isn't about anti-plant base that's

295
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,740
not it so if you if you don't know

296
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,300
medical medium information and you're

297
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,620
listening you might get confused for a

298
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,399
second be like what's he talking about

299
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,399
Okay so

300
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,339
the organ Meats in eggs and muscle meat

301
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,019
like the carnivore guys started doing

302
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,360
you end up starving your brain

303
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,820
and it gets no glucose and you end up

304
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,560
getting sick they won't really tell

305
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,180
anybody that's what's happening but then

306
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,040
what happens is you end up bringing

307
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,680
honey in so the carnivore people brought

308
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,500
honey in now that's funny so Oregon

309
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,399
meets animal just a muscle animal tissue

310
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,079
organ Meats and eggs and now we're

311
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,540
bringing in honey so it was a whole

312
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,220
couple of years of that BS where the

313
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,380
carnivore guys were bringing in Honey

314
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,940
and then they were you know telling

315
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,980
people what they're doing and how oh

316
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,360
autoimmune it beats autoimmune it does

317
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,320
all this stuff they had to bring in

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,019
honey

319
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,880
and now the carnivore guys they're

320
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,320
bringing in fruit now okay so I'm

321
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,420
scratching my head I'm like sounds like

322
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,940
you're just about pretty much reaching a

323
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,459
regular animal protein based healthier

324
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,100
version of a diet so now it's not like

325
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,139
carnivore anymore they moved into

326
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,660
having to bring in Fruit so they're like

327
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,139
yeah my carnivore diet is now with fruit

328
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,440
and honey yup and I use lemons too

329
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,720
they'll do that now it's like okay uh

330
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,720
sure it's very interesting there because

331
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,040
it failed and then you failed people in

332
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
the same time that we're following you

333
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,220
that did the same thing so they're

334
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
learning on your little experiment while

335
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,820
you're learning on your little

336
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,920
experiment Gina says I lost 35 pounds

337
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,700
eating potatoes three times a day thanks

338
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,980
to Medical medium

339
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,440
and someone believes that the potatoes

340
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,200
will make you obese

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,980
and destroy your blood sugar your

342
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,380
insulin resistance will get crazy

343
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,760
these are collard greens if you want to

344
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,620
know

345
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,000
fresh out of the garden right there got

346
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,399

347
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,240
you guys are okay with that

348
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,279
making a potato salad evil potato salad

a man over there in IG says I've been

350
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,139
eating potatoes for every meal since

351
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,899
January and I have not become obese nor

352
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,000
diabetic

353
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:05,700
indeed indeed indeed so what I'm doing

354
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,560
is I'm gonna finely chop up these

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,660
collard greens in this salad okay

356
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,880
because I don't want them in big hunky

357
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,440
pieces so I want to chop them up a

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,760

Marissa spiritual said on IG had all my

366
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,060
teeth drilled and never drank lemon

367
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,860
water in my life since having lemon

368

my enamel is coming back and healing

370
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,279
because

371
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,740
lemon water helps to kill the bad

372
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,820
bacteria in the mouth around the gums

373
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,100
and teeth

374
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,139
and it doesn't hurt teeth

375
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,380
it doesn't but you know what destroys

376
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,380
teeth

377
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,220

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,139
like nobody's done this if that makes

381
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,820
any sense

382
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,560

466
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,720

with the uh you know the whole thing uh

474
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,780
against the medical medium Community

right that you guys may be aware of that

476
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,760

477
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,280
with it's not my success it's the

478
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,520
success of people healing I would be

479
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,200
nobody or nothing because whatever it is

480
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,299
like meaning like I would no one even

481
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,820
know my name who is that guy and what

482
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,860
happened in the last 35 years is peop

483
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,160
before the books even came out people

484
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,679
knew my name because of the protocols

485
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,900
and the information I worked with a lot

486
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,480
of people helping them heal all through

487
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,520
the industry even before the books came

488
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,140
out it's why I was World known for it

489
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,000
and people around the world traveled to

490
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,799
visit me to get info information they

491
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,840
couldn't get anywhere else right so what

492
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,640
happened is people were healing it was

493
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,200
always people healing information was

494
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,340

495
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,440
millions of people around the world

496
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,539

497
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,179

and many in many and even the Product

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,600

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,539
about these they're told that

553
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,980
misinformation out there but do what

554
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,260
your doctor tells you to do I'm just

555
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,240
saying right but I'm saying what I tell

556
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,100
my family and friends is don't be afraid

557
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,440
of the kale don't be afraid of the

558
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,039
collard greens right there don't be

559
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,400
afraid of those those have phytochemical

560
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,320
compounds that enter into the thyroid to

561
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,260
help get rid of the problem now here's

562
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,820
what is interesting you might say well

563
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,400
what's he talking about first of all

564
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,900
medical meme information is the first to

565
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,280
put the truth out about why we have

566
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,980
hypothyroid

567
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,780
and why we have Hashimoto's thyroiditis

568
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,580
from the Epstein-Barr virus entering

569
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,980
into the thyroid

570
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,700
well

571
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:35,700
these cruciferous cruciferous right here

572
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,679
have properties to help enter into the

573
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,419
thyroid to break down the Epstein-Barr

574
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,039
virus and that's the difference but yet

575
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,480
people are told stay away from the

576
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,520
gorgeous because they don't understand

577
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,440
how it works

578
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,500
anyway I got some kale in here I got

579
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,600
some collard greens

580
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:57,299
foreign

581
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,299
fear out there is insane insane

582
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,260
okay

583
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,360
we're putting this together we got a

584
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,919
little kale in there we got um some

585
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,600
collard greens in here I think I'm gonna

586
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,100
put a little bit more lettuce I want to

587
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,620
kind of make it a little higher up in

588
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,000
the bowl just a bigger bigger bowl of

589
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,000
that so let me just get that in there

590
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,740
okay

591
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,780
all right

592
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:27,480
chop up some potatoes let's do that

593
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,760
before we do that I think I'm going to

594
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,559
put some basil now this is a gorgeous

595
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,500
Thai Basil right here

596
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,419
on IG Emily says your info is the only

597
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,000
real info out there thank you for always

598
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:41,340
remaining consistent giving it to us

599
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,799
straight and never backing down on the

600
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,559
truth even when it's not popular you are

601
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,780
a true gift I'm honored what you'll find

602
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,000
and it's not because of me

603
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,480
I will I will not take the credit it's

604
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,780
SOC what you'll find is consistency

605
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,280
consistency and non-contradictive

606
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,220
that's what you're going to find with mm

607
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,539
info the reason why is because I hear a

608
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,240
voice that's keeping it all straight

609
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:08,159
because how the hell is it possible to

610
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,440
keep eight large medical textbooks

611
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,620
straight with information and 35 years

612
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,840
of work and not steer off the path

613
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,159
you'll get the best guys out there and

614
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
alternative medicine and conventional

615
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,039
medicine they're out there being like

616
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,419
you know they're out there like looking

617
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,220
for fame and they're all over YouTube

618
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,080
and everywhere else they can't keep

619
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,000
anything straight it's one year it's

620
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,620
this one year it's this six months later

621
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
it's this they say this but they say

622
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,559
that they do this but they do that

623
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,299
they're so all over the place they can't

624
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,340
keep one thing straight contradiction

625
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,900
contradiction contradiction the reason

626
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,280
why they're not called out for it they

627
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,500
can't keep a crowd long enough they're

628
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,360
cycling new people through their ads 24

629
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,919
7 and new person comes and doesn't know

630
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,460
they just contradicted themselves six

631
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,460
months ago

632
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,679
decided to go to bed a little earlier

633
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,100
last night I don't know if you guys

634
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,100
noticed

635
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,940
throwing some basil in here

636
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,400
decided to go to bed a little bit

637
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,400
earlier last night

638
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:21,000
Anna had a full day's work

639
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,000
man it's night time again

640
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,240
foreign

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,159
says I like that you hear a voice aw

642
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,700
thank you

643
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,200
the years of bullying about it and

644
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,380
everything else that's happened to me is

645
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,820
just off the charts so thank you for

646
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,820
liking the fact that I hear a voice

647
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,400
that's why there's campaigns right now

648
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,500
trying to just wreak havoc

649
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,659
on AW and everything because they just

650
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,400
can't stand it

651
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,340

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,320
not letting our Stones go tonight

666
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:38,940
all right so okay

667
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,760
all right

668
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,100
let's figure this out I have a salad

669
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,200
building

670
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,919
I am going to put some potatoes in there

671
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,919
if that's okay

672
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,820
potatoes

673
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,220
what I'm doing is I'm cutting it like

674
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,720
this so if you look I sectioned them

675
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,580
into like that

676
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,440
so they're

677
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,900
that's how you cut them so I'm going to

678
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,400
do this do you like your potato pieces

679
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
in your potato salads do you like them

680
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,179
bigger or smaller

681
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,860
if you were a guest in the kitchen in

682
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,659
this moment right here with your guest

683
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,159
kitchen right here anyway but if you

684
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,080
were sitting here

685
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,120
I would say do you do like hunky

686
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,559
potatoes do you like them not hunky do

687
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,360
you like them chopped a little smaller

688
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,360
that's what I would ask you guys

689
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,320
all right so um I'm not gonna make them

690
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:31,860
too big I I like them about that size

691
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,799
I don't like them super hunky

692
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,200
pop those on top just like that

693
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,799
boom let's get another one

694
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,799
nice

695
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,659
instead of throwing fruit in the air

696
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,820
like I like to do I was just um flipping

697
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,380
a potato

698
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,880

699
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,740
same kind of cutting action are you guys

700
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,480

00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,040
took years to try to unravel the Tomato

850
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,540
the whole tomato hate thing I fought for

851
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,720

856
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,660
the fear around a darn tomato all the

857
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,300
fear around nightshades and potatoes

858
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,359
all if you're around fruit

859
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,420
the health movement if you got sick 15

860
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,640
years ago or 18 years ago or 20 years

861
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,780
ago if you got sick then I just have to

862
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,020
tell you guys

863
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,119
you would run across the Nightshade fear

864
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,060
where they would bury it into your brain

865
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,760
you would run across the Tomato hate the

866
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,440
potato hate the pepper hate the eggplant

867
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,540
hate then you would run across all the

868
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,400
fruit fear you'd be totally screwed on

869
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,380
the whole fruit for your thing then he

870
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,820
would run across the gorgeous Foods then

871
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,260
he would rot across the cruciferous

872
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,900
exactly because that you would run

873
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,820
across all of this times 10 plus

874
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,020
oxalates and everything else and you

875
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,420
would be literally not eating anything

876
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,000
but I'm the problem when I brought all

877
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,480

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,220
like that a rosemary leaf I don't want

926
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,440
to be chewing on that so I'm just

927
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,900
actually chopping it up is fine

928
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,900
I can go a little bit more than that but

929
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,680

930
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,500

936
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,740
relationship with my stones

937
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,660

938
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,760
Stones too

939
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,099
Michelle Clayton says I keep leaving my

Stone named abandonment

potato salad are you okay with that

949
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,859

00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,599

962
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,339
Barbara cologne says over there on

963
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,500
Facebook I picked three stones in

964
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,780
January and I kept them with me since

965
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,760
but there is no comparison with the

966
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,060
attachment that grew with these three

967
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,800
now exactly I did put them aside right

968
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,599
before starting this journey and I was

969
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,520
planning on picking them back up and

970
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,380
doing the same thing we just did in

971
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,079
these seven days because I don't feel

972
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm ready to release those yet a lot of

973
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,599
deep connections haven't been made yet I

974
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,119

potato salad I'm gonna kind of like I

984
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,280
like drizzling just a little bit

985
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,900
sometimes not all the time but for this

986
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,060
one I want to do that tonight I'm in the

987
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,099
mood for that and I'm gonna put squeeze

988
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,560
some lemon and squeeze a lime that's a

989
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:24,119
ripe lime right there

990
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,220
Angels 444 blessed I've definitely felt

991
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,280
a shift but I feel Darkness keeps

992
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,940
pulling me down thank God I Rise quickly

993
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,099
yeah I'm gonna rise up

994
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,320
look there's a lot of fork tongue Devils

995
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,300
out there and they're spewing they're

996
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,300
evil and they're spearing their Darkness

997
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:45,000
there's a lot of activity out there a

998
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,780
lot of Darkness has a lot of that I

999
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,540
notice every time we rise up and we do

1000
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,579
even better and we rise up and we do

1001
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,859
even better better for the community

1002
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,839
better it was like when the light blast

1003
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:00,660
happened all you heard was Fork tongue

1004
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,540
devil spewing hatred everywhere on

1005
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:07,200
Instagram and everything so yeah he's

1006
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,460
bad he's terrible this is a slight blast

1007
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,339
thing and they're just spewing it's

1008
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,440
almost like it's kind of like vampires

1009
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,599
right when the sunlight goes through the

1010
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,820
window and the vampires they don't get

1011
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,500
into their coffins in time they just

1012
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,300
start going and their fangs come out

1013
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,700
right well that's what's happening I'm

1014
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,140
noticing the hater clubs against the

1015
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,960
medical medium which are plenty of them

1016
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,760
they just freak out as the as the light

1017
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,079
hits them the light blast caused a lot

1018
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,880
of it so what I'm saying is if you're

1019
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,540
rising up because that's what I do right

1020
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,339
I Rise Up and then you do better and you

1021
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,380
do better for people you do you're

1022
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,880
working on your healing process you're

1023
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,099
you're you're cleaning yourself up

1024
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,780
you're helping others you're doing all

1025
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,640
this stuff and then Darkness loves to be

1026
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,780
like no no you're not allowed to do that

1027
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,780
you're not allowed to do that

1028
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,040
okay over there in IG

1029
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,380
butterfly notice the magical things

1030
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,440
happening with my Stones experiences and

1031
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:07,140

1035
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:19,140
is unlike anything anything out there I

1036
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,140
try to give everybody the forewarning I

1037
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:25,099

00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,859
lemon

1046
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:47,099

1047
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,839
already I'm gonna squeeze that I try not

1048
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,640
to get seeds on there if I get the seeds

1049
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,200
on there I usually use a little strain

1050
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,240
or two so you can squeeze the heck out

1051
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,380
of it but I'm just getting some lemon on

1052
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,839

1065
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,400

00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,140

this morning very disturbing dream felt

1092
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,819
my

1093
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,040
discomfort Stone was absorbing that pain

1094
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:48,060
and negative energies from that dream

1095
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:50,160
woke up and waved my arm to clear the

1096
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,540
air

1097
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,980

Stone Journey whoa whoa whoa whoa

1101
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:08,940
an IG birding around town I wasn't sure

1102
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:13,020
how big my connection was with my Stones

1103
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:17,839
until I lost one and then felt sad it

1104
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,839
was gone so quickly but I found it again

1105
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,020

injury from a medical treatment that was

1125
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:23,700
given to me 37 years ago very

1126
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:25,920

00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,780

two years and I feel the best ever I had

1136
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,839
an incredible dream after reading the

1137
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:54,020

1138
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:54,020

1140
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,260
over there okay I'm gonna mix this up

1141
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,980
now you can you can do that you can do

1142
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,420
one of two things you can do anything

1143
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,440
you want

1144
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,900
but

1145
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,240
I'm not totally mixing everything up

1146
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,099
crazy right I'm kind of just letting

1147
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,780
things kind of fall down in there a

1148
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,640
little bit let some of that lemon juice

1149
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,680
fall down in there

1150
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,200
and let the potatoes kind of come down

1151
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,240
but I'm not like doing a complete total

1152
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,020
crazy mix

1153
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,020

way hotter than I thought that would be

1293
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,119
it's so hot I'm gonna try to look for

1294
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,119
spots that have no pepper

1295
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,680
that's good

1296
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,680
okay

1297
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,240
on IG

1298
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,339
Terry Hillman says can you cleanse while

1299
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,180
breastfeeding and still keep your milk

1300
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:09,540
supply what keeps milk supply

1301
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,339
first of all you want clean milk supply

1302
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:15,480
anything you're cleansing out of your

1303
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:17,819
body is making your milk cleaner

1304
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,760
so when you're breastfeeding you're

1305
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:22,800
giving your baby cleaner milk

1306
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,319
the more toxins that come out of your

1307
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,420
body the less toxic milk there will be

1308
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:29,220
that's one thing another thing that's

1309
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,559
really important is

1310
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:33,780
is cleansing isn't

1311
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,220
unless you're doing some crazy cleanse

1312
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,720
out there that's not MediCal medium if

1313
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,940
you're doing like water fasting while

1314
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,859
trying to breastfeed that you're going

1315
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,059
to lose your milk

1316
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:44,059
you're going to lose your milk

1317
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,760
if you're eating a carnivore diet where

1318
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,160
it's just all animal protein only you're

1319
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,220
going to lose your milk

1320
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:57,920
because the milk is lactose

1321
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,920
right it's glucose sorry it's glucose

1322
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,680
sugar is in the milk it's critical sugar

1323
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,079
and carbohydrates is what the human

1324
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,800
body's milk is mostly made out of making

1325
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,800
sure that's clear

1326
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,059
because that's really what it's about

1327
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,839
it's about making sure your milk is high

1328
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:17,940
in sugar high in carbohydrate high in

1329
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,980
glucose critical because that's what

1330
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:23,280
builds the baby's brain that's what

1331
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,339
builds the baby's muscles that is a big

1332
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,640
part of all of it if the breast milk is

1333
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:32,460
lacking sugar the baby starves

1334
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,500
essentially or the baby has problems

1335
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,900
that's the whole point so if you take

1336
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,660
out all your fruit and you take out

1337
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,940
potatoes and you take out all of that we

1338
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,160
get in trouble right but if we cleanse

1339
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,319
and do some crazy cleanse like a juice

1340
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,200
fast where it's nothing but these juices

1341
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,359
then yeah that's not good

1342
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,740
for the breast milk there won't be

1343
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,960
enough glucose there won't be enough

1344
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,300
carbs inside the breast milk breast milk

1345
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,579
is mostly sugar and only a little bit of

1346
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,920
protein and only a little bit of fat

1347
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:04,380
that's what breast milk is

1348
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,540
human breast milk is a little bit of

1349
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,760
protein a little bit of fat and then a

1350
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:12,059
lot of sugar so in the sense essentially

1351
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,680
it's sugar water for the baby

1352
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,660
and that's what breast milk is made out

1353
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,460
of so if you're doing a medical medium

1354
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,700
cleanse you're obviously getting food

1355
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:23,640
and ample amounts of glucose

1356
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:26,819
because mircomium cleanses don't starve

1357
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,040
a person they don't starve a person

1358
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,660
they don't underfeed that's the whole

1359
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,540
point these cleanses are geared so you

1360
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:36,119
can cleanse heal still provide enough

1361
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,339
for all all that your body needs the

1362
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,020
glucose for your brain all of it for

1363
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:42,020
your liver and all that's happening

1364
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,140
guys I'm like multi

1365
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,140
multitasking everywhere

1366
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,319
yep

1367
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,839
human breast milk is mostly sugar it's

1368
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:02,780
supposed to be

1369
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:05,520
I'll try to make it as clear as I can

1370
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:08,180
not muddy up the water

1371
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,180
so good

1372
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,140
such a good salad so anyway

1373
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,020
just to kind of finish up on the food

1374
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,559
for your thing

1375
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,300
um I just want to say that

1376
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,980
I do feel sorry for so many people

1377
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,119
throughout the decades throughout the

1378
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,579
years

1379
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,040
that have been thrown off course

1380
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:31,800
with fruit fear

1381
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,720
food fear food confusion

1382
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,920
and at the same time not knowing why

1383
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,460
they're sick and not knowing what's

1384
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,460
wrong with them

1385
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,880
then catastrophic catastrophic on

1386
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,799
humankind

1387
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,440
in the health movement world

1388
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:50,099
and what has happened

1389
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,900
and what one of the big fear makers

1390
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:53,940
is protein right you're not getting

1391
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,859
enough protein you need protein you need

1392
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:58,440
protein puts people in fear and Chaos

1393
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:59,760
your body's gonna fall apart you're sick

1394
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,319
because you don't have enough protein

1395
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,900
that's crazy because that's all people

1396
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:05,880
have ever eaten

1397
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,920
that's all they've ever eaten all these

1398
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,720
decades and years and years and decades

1399
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,520
is plenty of protein that's the whole

1400
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,220
point and they got sick and they were

1401
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,599
sick you can be a plant-based person and

1402
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,339
you're eating too much soy protein

1403
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,319
you're eating up you're eating way too

1404
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:21,599
much nuts you're eating you can still

1405
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:22,980
get yourself you can get tons of protein

1406
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,200
and still be sick because what I'm

1407
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,660
saying is protein

1408
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,160
isn't the answer it never was the answer

1409
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,319
I've talked about this for years I've

1410
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,740
written about it in the medical medium

1411
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,740
book series

1412
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:40,140
the amount of food fear has been

1413
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:42,660
truly at a level

1414
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:44,819
especially in the health room

1415
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,319
truly at a level that's confused and

1416
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:48,660
completely thrown people off their game

1417
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:52,680
they're healing for years and decades

1418
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,940
and that includes like the cruciferous

1419
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,220
right

1420
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,240
and it includes also the night shades

1421
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,240
and the oxalates

1422
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:06,000
and the lectins and much more and

1423
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,040
includes it all and it's thrown just

1424
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,839
people into

1425
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,839
confusion while they're trying to heal

1426
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:18,299
creative artery says

1427
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,640
I have histamine intolerance and Mast

1428
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:24,000
Cell Activation disorder and it's hard

1429
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,020
to not fear food my body hates me I also

1430
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,020
try to be vegan

1431
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,980
our bodies love us unconditionally

1432
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,319
they

1433
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,359
are fighting for us they're working for

1434
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:38,400
us

1435
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:40,500
and then when we pick up pathogens along

1436
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,540
the way because

1437
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,460
the industries put the pathogens out

1438
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:47,339
there you know that now more than ever

1439
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,440
before just in the last three years

1440
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:51,240
but the industries put pathogens out

1441
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,980
there and then people have these

1442
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,260
pathogens these pathogens create a lot

1443
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,579
of problems we get sick our bodies try

1444
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:00,299
to fight for it but we have to give our

1445
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:02,760
body what it needs to fight for us

1446
01:01:00,299 --> 01:01:04,920
healing with Holly 144 says I tried to

1447
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,619
warn my stepbrother about the carnivore

1448
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,140
diet and he said they are bringing more

1449
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,880
fruit and raw honey in now because they

1450
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:14,520
need some glucose and I thought that

1451
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,460
came from aw it did come from aw that's

1452
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:20,880
where it exactly came from so the carna

1453
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:23,400
carnivore the carnivore boys

1454
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,140
out there right on YouTube and

1455
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,339
everywhere else are using medical medium

1456
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,680
information

1457
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:30,839
because it's exactly what I predicted

1458
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,059
for them I predicted they would all hit

1459
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:35,700
the wall and they did

1460
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:38,400
all the carnivore dudes out there

1461
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:41,880
yelling about how great their diet was

1462
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,099
just eat organ Meats just eat eggs only

1463
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,960
and they all hit the wall and I said

1464
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:49,559
they would hit the wall years ago

1465
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:53,059
and they did it was exactly as predicted

1466
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:56,640
by SOC and they hit the freaking wall

1467
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:58,619
boom like that and guess what

1468
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,059
they're eating honey like no tomorrow

1469
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,440
and they're eating fruit like no

1470
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:02,940
tomorrow because they can't even talk

1471
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,859
those guys are like they've lost their

1472
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,480
minds because they got no glucose and

1473
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:07,799
