[0.66 - 5.04] I'm reading about mystery fears and
[3.60 - 7.74] worries do you know somebody who has
[5.04 - 11.22] mysterious fears mysterious worries
[7.74 - 13.14] comes and goes sometimes you get a kind
[11.22 - 15.72] of a grip on it and you got it in
[13.14 - 17.76] control you're managing it and then
[15.72 - 19.38] three months later it's like the fears
[17.76 - 21.72] come back and then it's triggering some
[19.38 - 23.34] anxiety and the worries are there too so
[21.72 - 25.20] I'm reading in the brain saver books
[23.34 - 27.36] this is an interesting topic so many
[25.20 - 29.58] people are dealing with this by the way
[27.36 - 31.38] this is just scratching the surface of
[29.58 - 32.10] what's in the brain saver books both of
[31.38 - 34.44] them
[32.10 - 36.18] sometimes we know exactly why we're
[34.44 - 38.76] afraid or worried
[36.18 - 41.22] sometimes we do we like know why we're
[38.76 - 43.32] afraid we know why we're scared of
[41.22 - 45.90] something sometimes it feels like it
[43.32 - 48.84] comes out of the blue though like why
[45.90 - 51.00] did it happen those unexplained cases of
[48.84 - 53.88] fear and worry are often due to a past
[51.00 - 56.82] experience that's been triggered without
[53.88 - 59.22] us knowing so here's the thing there's
[56.82 - 61.20] people that know about their triggers so
[59.22 - 63.14] something they hear something they learn
[61.20 - 65.88] about or something they experience
[63.14 - 68.82] they'll know it's triggering they'll
[65.88 - 70.80] have experience with that but there's a
[68.82 - 73.20] lot of people that get this mysterious
[70.80 - 75.24] fear and worry that creeps up they were
[73.20 - 78.48] triggered but they actually don't know
[75.24 - 81.18] they were triggered that's an important
[78.48 - 83.70] detail people don't know out there
[81.18 - 85.92] because in times of pain our brains put
[83.70 - 88.32] up healthy productive emotional walls to
[85.92 - 90.96] help us cope our brains are putting up
[88.32 - 93.12] emotional walls these emotional walls
[90.96 - 95.52] are there so we can cope with life so we
[93.12 - 98.10] can push through these are boundaries
[95.52 - 102.24] that were not meant to be knocked down
[98.10 - 105.18] so our coping boundary was never meant
[102.24 - 107.16] to be knocked down these walls allow us
[105.18 - 109.02] to get through our days without being
[107.16 - 111.54] constantly reminded of what's happened
[109.02 - 113.34] to us because if we're constantly being
[111.54 - 114.66] reminded of the bad thing that's
[113.34 - 116.88] happened to us
[114.66 - 119.10] or something that wasn't good that
[116.88 - 122.28] happened to us if we're being being
[119.10 - 124.50] reminded every single minute we can then
[122.28 - 128.16] be in a state of being that's not good
[124.50 - 130.02] so there's healthy emotional walls built
[128.16 - 132.42] inside our brain which I talk about in
[130.02 - 133.92] brain saver and those healthy emotional
[132.42 - 135.78] laws are there to protect you so you're
[133.92 - 138.54] not thinking about that thing that
[135.78 - 140.70] happened to you every second and if that
[138.54 - 142.98] wall comes down and we're thinking about
[140.70 - 144.66] that bad thing every single second then
[142.98 - 145.76] we're kind of in in another form of
[144.66 - 148.44] trouble
[145.76 - 151.02] unresolved experiences remain recorded
[148.44 - 153.06] in our brains so when we have an
[151.02 - 155.52] encounter in our present
[153.06 - 157.74] that invokes the past it can trigger
[155.52 - 159.90] emotions we felt before even if we don't
[157.74 - 162.30] understand why so we can get the trigger
[159.90 - 165.12] without realizing it by receiving
[162.30 - 167.46] something some kind of information or
[165.12 - 170.46] running into someone and not realize
[167.46 - 172.68] that that person's triggering them
[170.46 - 175.20] and then it happens we have the
[172.68 - 177.30] mysterious fear worry anxiety feeling
[175.20 - 179.64] lost feeling sad everything else around
[177.30 - 181.92] it much of the time those unresolved
[179.64 - 184.02] episodes involved other people who
[181.92 - 185.40] didn't Rectify or recognize their
[184.02 - 188.52] wrongdoings
[185.40 - 191.04] sometimes what happened was terrifying
[188.52 - 193.34] extreme or Unthinkable sometimes it
[191.04 - 196.80] didn't seem upsetting to outside
[193.34 - 199.32] observers and yet we had our reasons for
[196.80 - 200.46] finding it deeply hurtful isn't it
[199.32 - 203.10] interesting
[200.46 - 207.96] when someone new appears in Our Lives
[203.10 - 210.30] who reminds us even subconsciously of a
[207.96 - 212.70] person from the past
[210.30 - 213.78] we can get in trouble so somebody brand
[212.70 - 216.48] new
[213.78 - 218.96] somebody we don't even know we end up
[216.48 - 222.36] talking to or running into
[218.96 - 225.42] subconsciously reminds us of something
[222.36 - 227.70] or somebody hurtful in the past we can
[225.42 - 232.04] be triggered and not realize it and then
[227.70 - 232.04] we go down into that rabbit hole
[233.28 - 238.02] even subconsciously this happens of a
[236.10 - 241.32] person from the past mystery fears and
[238.02 - 243.84] worries can Surface a Gateway in an
[241.32 - 245.70] emotional wall opens because that new
[243.84 - 247.20] person awakened a memory in the
[245.70 - 248.46] emotional centers of the brain behind
[247.20 - 250.32] the wall so here's how it works in the
[248.46 - 253.74] emotional centers of the brain
[250.32 - 256.38] a Gateway opens up so you run into this
[253.74 - 259.08] new person the new person is triggering
[256.38 - 260.58] because they're knocking down a wall we
[259.08 - 262.14] don't realize so something we're
[260.58 - 264.66] experiencing in that moment from that
[262.14 - 267.48] new person is starting to bring down the
[264.66 - 269.10] wall that's there to Shield us from what
[267.48 - 271.74] happened a long time ago in the past
[269.10 - 273.72] from an experience of another person and
[271.74 - 275.64] as that wall starts to come down we
[273.72 - 276.90] don't realize it and then we're in a
[275.64 - 279.00] rabbit hole we're in a difficult
[276.90 - 280.74] situation we're in mysterious fears and
[279.00 - 282.96] worries and other things too like
[280.74 - 286.08] anything can Surface after that point
[282.96 - 287.94] bad memories experiences that happen in
[286.08 - 289.62] the past you know anything that happened
[287.94 - 291.84] with relationships with other people
[289.62 - 293.40] whatever it was it can all surface as
[291.84 - 295.80] that emotional wall crumbles down
[293.40 - 298.50] triggered by somebody new who didn't
[295.80 - 300.60] even have an experience with you in your
[298.50 - 303.30] past someone that didn't even know you
[300.60 - 306.96] up until that moment and they triggered
[303.30 - 309.18] you into a bad situation
[306.96 - 311.46] another source of pagan that can come
[309.18 - 314.10] back to visit is the trauma of once
[311.46 - 315.96] being sick or injured
[314.10 - 318.54] if you've been sick
[315.96 - 320.16] and you struggled with chronic illness
[318.54 - 322.26] and you know what it's like to be in
[320.16 - 324.00] that place and you're on mattress Island
[322.26 - 326.58] for a long time and you lost friends and
[324.00 - 328.26] you lost family and you lost things in
[326.58 - 329.94] your life quality of life and you
[328.26 - 332.28] struggled and you fought your way back
[329.94 - 334.56] you got the medical meme information and
[332.28 - 336.66] you fought your way back to healing and
[334.56 - 339.66] moved forward
[336.66 - 341.04] and you can still become triggered
[339.66 - 343.50] because you can remember like oh my God
[341.04 - 345.90] I remember how bad it was I remember
[343.50 - 347.28] I was having a hard time and anybody
[345.90 - 348.90] who's having a hard time now and you're
[347.28 - 350.16] struggling it's okay because you're
[348.90 - 352.62] going to move forward and do your
[350.16 - 354.24] healing but when you're healed and
[352.62 - 356.28] you're better you still may get
[354.24 - 359.22] triggered once in a while kind of taking
[356.28 - 361.80] you back down memory lane of wow so much
[359.22 - 364.26] was going on back then after we heal
[361.80 - 366.18] feeling a hint of a symptom or any sort
[364.26 - 367.92] of twinge pain can put us back into fear
[366.18 - 369.60] and worry and I see that all the time I
[367.92 - 371.94] see people heal a hundred symptoms and
[369.60 - 373.26] conditions from the medical by using the
[371.94 - 375.42] medical medium books by the way the
[373.26 - 377.94] brand saver books
[375.42 - 379.74] wait you guys have these I can't even
[377.94 - 382.38] tell you how much is in here
[379.74 - 385.38] what happens is we heal we get rid of 50
[382.38 - 387.24] 60 symptoms even four or five symptoms
[385.38 - 389.58] but you can get rid of a lot of symptoms
[387.24 - 393.48] right with medical meme information and
[389.58 - 396.96] then if you get one symptom because you
[393.48 - 400.08] healed 99 of them you're like on top of
[396.96 - 401.10] the world and then you push yourself so
[400.08 - 403.74] hard
[401.10 - 405.72] you get into a new relationship you get
[403.74 - 406.86] into a new job you get into whatever it
[405.72 - 408.30] is and you're pushing yourself and
[406.86 - 410.88] you're burning the candle and all of a
[408.30 - 412.74] sudden an old reminder of one of the
[410.88 - 414.48] hundred symptoms start to creep up a
[412.74 - 416.22] little because you're getting a little
[414.48 - 419.04] deficient or you're not keeping to what
[416.22 - 421.14] you need to do or you put aside the
[419.04 - 422.82] information for months and months and
[421.14 - 424.80] you start feeling that one symptom
[422.82 - 426.18] concrete back up as a reminder hey you
[424.80 - 428.88] got to take care of yourself from what
[426.18 - 431.16] you learned it can trigger that
[428.88 - 432.12] experience of being like Oh my God I
[431.16 - 434.28] remember
[432.12 - 435.48] or maybe you picked up a new pathogen
[434.28 - 436.98] and that's what happens to so many
[435.48 - 439.08] people they heal a hundred symptoms
[436.98 - 441.96] conditions they heal 50 symptoms
[439.08 - 444.60] conditions and then they're out on the
[441.96 - 446.64] dating scene and then they're drinking
[444.60 - 448.68] off somebody else's glass and then
[446.64 - 450.78] they're doing whatever and they're in a
[448.68 - 452.58] public bathroom but they end up getting
[450.78 - 454.26] exposure from a sink in a public
[452.58 - 456.42] bathroom whatever it is they pick up a
[454.26 - 459.48] knee streptococcus a new Epstein bar a
[456.42 - 461.82] new shingles virus and then they're
[459.48 - 463.98] triggered into like oh my God am I sick
[461.82 - 466.74] again of course it means just get back
[463.98 - 468.60] on get back on the wagon and you know
[466.74 - 470.64] start working on it do apply what you
[468.60 - 473.64] need to do the tools but it can trigger
[470.64 - 475.80] that feeling inside of us
[473.64 - 477.84] finally if someone has been busy all
[475.80 - 479.46] their life pushing through every day in
[477.84 - 482.34] survival mode from a young age without
[479.46 - 484.14] help or support and some of the stress
