now so decades ahead of everything

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,480
science and research doesn't know what's

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,680
going on in chronic illness I'm just

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,960
going to say it plain and simple just so

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,480
you know I know that sounds strange but

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,960
if someone's sick and they're going to

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,000
doctor to doctor and they're going to

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,360
look through everything and they're

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,840
going everywhere in any place and

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,600
they're trying everything and they can't

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
get answers for their anxiety they can't

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,840
get answers for anything they can't get

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,440
answers for the depression cuz nobody

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,359
knows what's what's going on with

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,680
depression same thing with with anything

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,119
even basic hotus thyroiditis everything

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,960
aches and pains all kinds of different

28
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:10,040
neurological problems people get fatigue

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,680
and all that there's no real answers a

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,799
lot of theory the body's attacking

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,880
itself it's your genes so forth and so

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,640
on and so on so on this show clears up

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,840
everything for so much and for so many

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,680
people for a reason it's the source that

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,920
was given to me since Age

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,560
4 that allows me to have information

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,759
that's free information that's free from

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,600
everything

39
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,399
free from the whole thing this is the

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,040
only show anywhere that where the

41
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,720
information here doesn't come from

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,759
medical interest groups medical funding

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,880
with strings attached Bots research

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,799
lobbyist internal Kickbacks persuaded

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,560
belief systems private panel of

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,439
influencers and health field payoffs in

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,439
the system out there in

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,799
alternative and conventional medicine

49
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,920
and trendy traps we avoid trendy traps

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,840
so in alternative medicine so people

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
really get better so the belief systems

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,399
aren't all clog so everybody's not

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,079
clogged up with a belief system and they

54
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,680
get trapped and they're afraid of doing

55
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,960
so they're afraid of taking zinc cuz

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,560
they think it's going to deplete their

57
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,160
copper Meanwhile we're so depleted in

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879

know the whole bit I realize I realize

122
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,479
I'm a little tough on research and

123
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,000
science I'm a little tough on where we

124
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,960
stand but someone's got to stick up for

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
the doctors because that's what I'm

126
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,199
basically doing is sticking up for the

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
doctors because the doctors don't get

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,039
handed what they need they don't get

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
handed what they need in chronic illness

130
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,680
in chronic illness they just don't so

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
really what I'm doing is I'm fighting

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,919
for them I'm fighting for you I'm

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,080
fighting for them because doctors get

134
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,039
sick too practitioners get sick too

135
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,520
doctors healers get sick too they all

136
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,039
get sick with mystery illnesses no

137
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,039
matter if there's a diagnosis or a name

138
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,199
on it or anything like that they get

139
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,960
sick so let's get into the lymphatic

140
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,360
system that's it let's get into that the

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,680
lymphatic system so do you have a

142
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,160
lymphatic system yes you do of course

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,919
you do yep you you got one you better

144
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,960
believe it and it runs through

145
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:27,160
practically your entire body practically

146
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,960
your entire body it's it's it's almost

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,800
everywhere it's not every single spot

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,280
but it's darn close it I mean you got

149
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,120
your arms your arms your legs of

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,000
course um your abdomen all around your

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,720
colon all around your intestinal tract

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,400

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,319
liver around your

155
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,080
thyroid your neck up around your brain

156
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,840
in certain areas

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,960
all in the lower part of the neck going

158
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,800
up jaw right in the back of your head in

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,840
the back of your head okay there's

160
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,080
lymphatic vessels in all kinds of places

161
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,479
these strings are literally practically

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,360
everywhere in our body what do they do

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,479
what are they even for well science of

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,280
research knows they know the immune

165
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,639
systems involved lymphocytes you know

166
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,960
lymphatic white blood cells they're

167
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,520
involved so that's known out there they

168
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,680
also know when you get a swollen gland

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,280
or a swollen node they want to poke it

170
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,919
they want to jab it they want to jab it

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,199
looking for cancerous cells they want to

172
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,759
jab it looking for things that's

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,039
something they do often when someone has

174
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,360
a node um in the old days and I don't

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,319
mean too far old I mean 20 years ago 20

176
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,639
years ago 20 years ago is nothing 20

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
years ago is nothing I know when you're

178
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,680
20 years old when you're only 20 years

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,400
of age or 19 years of age age or 21

180
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,560
years of age or 24 years of age 20 years

181
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,800
ago is a lifetime feels like a lifetime

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
that feels like ancient history but it's

183
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,080
nothing to people who get older so when

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,800
you're 40 20 years ago look that they

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,960
all of a sudden when you're 40 20 years

186
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,240
ago is really like oh that was it 20

187
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,000
years ago 15 20 years ago what they used

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,160
to do and 25 years ago what they used to

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,080
do is they used to try to remove them

190
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,720
they used to cut people open so if

191
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,440
you're child and you go to the doctor

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,440
and you got some swollen glands and they

193
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,759
kind of don't know what it is and they

194
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,000
don't know what's going on they do some

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,560
blood work your your rbcs your white

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,840
count look pretty good they say Hey you

197
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,599
know usually doctors are like we can try

198
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,879
to remove one and then we'll take a look

199
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,639
at it we'll try to remove it and take a

200
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,720
look at it or we'll just take it out

201
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,759
that was a bad that was a bad technique

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,240
and they still kind of offer it some

203
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,199
some people just kind offer it now it's

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,599
not a good thing but that's you know

205
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,240
that's kind of where we are instead of

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,240
realizing what's really going on now the

207
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,080
lymphatic the lymphatic system is

208
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,680
designed is designed to literally attack

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,400
and go after pathogens that's what it's

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
designed for it's one of its great

211
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,639
designs protecting you from viral

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,400
Invasion protecting you from bacterial

213
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,520
Invasion that's one whole Avenue the

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
lymphatic system is all rigged up for

215
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,399
another Avenue another another whole

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,399
thing that the lymphatic system does is

217
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,080
is it pushes out the

218
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,760
garbage so it gathers and pushes and

219
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,160
squeezes out the garbage a lot of toxins

220
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
different kinds of toxins a lot of

221
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,000
particles a lot of different what I call

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,720
troublemakers that get all into the to

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,519
the the the plumbing that get all into

224
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,000
the plumbing of the body and so this is

225
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,440
so the lymphatic system plays a big role

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,160
with with actually trapping trapping

227
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,560
what you know basically just look at

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
your house if your house is filled with

229
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,360
dust if it's filled with different

230
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,040
particles if it's filled with you know

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,760
termite spray if it's filled with all

232
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,920
kinds of different things ant spray if

233
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,360
it's filled with whatever you know

234
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,800
carpet cleaning

235
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,320
chemicals you know sheetrock dust

236
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,440
whatever your house is filled with you

237
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,320
know even mold whatever your house is

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:30,000
filled with the lymphatic system's job

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,959
is to actually do something about it see

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,560
that's what it's like so it's like when

241
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,360
your body gets filled with all that

242
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,560
stuff just like a house and your body

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,079
gets filled with all those different

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,760
things I just mentioned what happens is

245
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,839
something you know somebody has to do

246
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,360
something about it inside the body and

247
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,920
the lymphatic system is one of these

248
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,240
things but the lymphatic system is an

249
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,959
organ's best

250
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,560
friend and a specific organ at indeed is

251
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,959
its best friend can you guess what organ

252
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,079
that is which organ did you say the

253
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,160
pancreas nope you're wrong no pancreas

254
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,160
sorry to say that no if you said the

255
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
pancreas did you say the thyroid no no

256
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,519
and you know lymphatic system isn't the

257
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
thyroids best friend I mean it they're

258
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,480
good friends don't get me wrong and the

259
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,600
pancreas is good friends too um the

260
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,480
kidneys you say the kidneys whoa you

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,519
said the kidneys Y no that's wrong that

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,360
one's wrong too are we we're how about

263
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,120
the colon and intestinal tract that

264
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,920
seems like like the

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,440
lymphatic uh systems best friend doesn't

266
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,200
it the colon intestinal track come on

267
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
all the gut health people out there

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
would think it's its best friend maybe

269
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,120
we hit it on the nose right there did

270
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
you guess that one well that's wrong too

271
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
that's wrong too that one that's

272
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,399
terrible terrible that I'm doing this I

273
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,200
shouldn't be playing this game okay what

274
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:00,079
else is it the brain's best

275
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,360
friend yeah it's got to be the brain's

276
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,399
best friend huh of course of course

277
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,279
lymphatic system no it's not I won't

278
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,360
torture you any longer it's the liver's

279
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:14,680
best friend it is the liver it's the

280
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,320
liver's best friend the lymphatic system

281
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,040
because the liver is the filter the main

282
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,120
filter the big filter the big solid

283
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,360
filter for all that garbage I was

284
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,440
talking about all those different

285
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,320
troublemakers and poisons we get into

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,639
the ones we inherited like the DDT

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,440
pesticides herbicides fungicides the

288
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,279
fungicides we get when we go into a

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,839
store a department store or we order

290
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
online a new

291
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,000
shirt and the new shirt is saturated

292
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
with the fungicide because they're all

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,200
sprayed all new clothing except for like

294
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,079
special te organic cotton specialty

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,480
organic cotton clothing or something

296
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
from a you know like a specialty maker

297
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,440
or something like that they won't have

298
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,399
the fungicide on there but all close all

299
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,839
close now they're sprayed they're hos

300
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,760
down with the fungicide the fungicide

301
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,639
companies which are the pesticide

302
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,920
companies seem to have sold all

303
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,519
manufacturing Goods a bill of goods you

304
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,880
know that they've gotten in there they

305
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,920
it never used to be like that the

306
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,839
fungicide is one of the worst chemicals

307
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,760
for the body because it gets it really

308
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,720
gets into liver hampers it hurts it and

309
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,160
therefore what does it hurt what do all

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,560
these toxins hurt when the liver is

311
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,360
hurting the lymphatic system

312
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,560
it hurts the lymphatic system that's

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,160
what it does so we have all these

314
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,199
poisons everywhere it's dropping out of

315
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,760
the sky out of planes you name it I'm

316
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,959
I'm not just talking about planes with

317
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,560
jet fuel too that's a whole another

318
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,600
thing I'm talking about planes without

319
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,720
passengers on them specifically to drop

320
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
stuff out of them you can you can you

321
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,199
know you wouldn't believe what's going

322
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,680
on so all this stuff is coming out of

323
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,079
the sky we got stuff spewing out of cars

324
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,519
which isn't the worst thing in the world

325
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,600
compared to what we're up against all

326
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,000
the time

327
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,600
but we got poisons Galore everywhere we

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,480
got solvents we got you got gasoline at

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
the gas pumps see in the old days and

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,279
this is all important because we're

331
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,440
talking about toxins for a reason this

332
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
is all important and then we're going to

333
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,160
get into some other stuff in the old

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,360
days it was only the gas attendant that

335
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,279
got the gasoline on her or him it was

336
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
only the gas attendee or the gas

337
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,399
attendant which which you know the the

338
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,399
guy or the gal that pumped gas at the

339
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,880
gas patient pumping gas yourself years

340
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,199
ago was an anomaly it was it was it was

341
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
rare it was rare it was like the

342
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,920
Sasquatch sightings it's like the yeti

343
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,600
sightings it's rare to catch a yeting

344
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeti sighting it's it's that you know so

345
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,120
it's like it's that kind of deal you're

346
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,240
at the gas pump now we're at the gas

347
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,399
pump in the old days it was just a gas

348
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,040
station people they lived their life in

349
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,120
gasoline they lived it every day and

350
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,320
that's what they did for a living and

351
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,920
there's still full serve in States and

352
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,519
there's full serve in different states

353
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,880
and there's full serve in different

354
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,040
places some gu some some states that

355
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,320
aren't full serve still offer it at some

356
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,959
places for like elderly people and stuff

357
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
like that so it's still out there but

358
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,680
it's it's it's honestly it's hard to

359
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,759
find unless you're in a state that does

360
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,120
full serve so the bottom line is the

361
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,040
exposure that gas station people would

362
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,920
get was just unbelievable they were

363
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,320
breathing it in all day long you got the

364
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,240
gas pumping into into the car you're

365
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,199
breathing in in all day long well now we

366
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,639
breathing in that never happened in

367
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,480
before our children are breathing it in

368
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,880
so our 16-year-old daughters are going

369
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,519
down to that they're pumping their own

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,360
gas that's because that's what we have

371
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,000
to do now so they're pumping their own

372
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,959
gas and they're literally being exposed

373
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,759
to gas fume something that never

374
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,959
happened in history never happened in

375
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,320
history before when gasoline in the oil

376
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,959
industry was created back in the early

377
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,880
1900s late 1800s and fuel was being

378
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,079
processed and the plants were being

379
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,839
built and all that was happening and

380
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,800
then we had engines running and then by

381
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,519
the 1905 the first cars or whatever I I

382
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
I don't have the year straight don't

383
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,720
quote me on those as the you know that

384
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,800
kind of stuff because I don't know what

385
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,639
year the first car I forgot but the

386
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,279
bottom line is you know and then the

387
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:23,839
cars 19 the 1900s early 1900s 1920s all

388
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:28,920
those years was Full Service gasoline

389
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:31,319
every decade 1930 1940 1950 1960 197 and

390
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,839
it went this it's changed now so our

391
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,880
16-year-old daughters are exposing

392
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,399
themselves to gasoline that's what's

393
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,759
happening now never happened before in

394
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,399
history I'm just telling you right now

395
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,519
our 16-year-old sons are actually

396
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,360
exposing themselves to gasoline and we

397
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,680
don't even think about it at all or

398
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,240
think anything about it whatsoever on

399
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,040
any level and of course our kids aren't

400
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,959
eating that good so that it's not like

401
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,240
they're eating they're drinking celery

402
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,839
juice it's not like it's not like we're

403
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,639
teaching our kids in the schools the

404
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
schools are teaching our kids how to eat

405
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,399
right no well that right now the schools

406
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,680
are saying stay high protein and low

407
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,160
carb that's what they're doing that's

408
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,240
not the answer either because when it

409
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,240
comes down to your liver and your

410
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,279
lymphatic system you need the right

411
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,600
antioxidants from Foods lots of fruits

412
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,839
and vegetables you need those

413
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,040
antioxidants to counter the amount of

414
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,680
poison

415
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,759
toxins that and and that are actually

416
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,120
getting into our bodies now than ever

417
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,880
before and going to the pizza place is

418
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,399
not going to cover it so so when our

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,199
kids are filling their gas tank and then

420
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,600
going to get a cheeseburger it's it's

421
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,079
all great and all and but it's not as

422
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,240
good as we need it to be is what I'm

423
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,079
saying so at a young age now we're

424
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
getting exposed to more toxins than ever

425
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,959
before we're inheriting toxins from our

426
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,600
family members going all the way back

427
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,639
from generation to generation from

428
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,720
Mercury going all the way back from DDT

429
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,800
during the old DDT days I talk about

430
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,240
this in life-changing foods you should

431
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,199
pick up life-changing Foods if you

432
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,480
haven't it's it's such like oh my God

433
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,920
it's one of my favorite books you know I

434
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,640
don't know which book is my favorite out

435
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,079
of the three books medical medium for

436
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,640
the first book and then life-changing

437
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,360
foods and thyroid healing I don't know

438
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,880
which one's my favorite I I keep on

439
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,439
going back and forth I'm like no this

440
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,520
one's my favorite no this one's my

441
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,120
favorite now this one's my favorite

442
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,400
anyway

443
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,000
anyway so we we're getting exposed to a

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,640
tremendous amount of toxins why is it

445
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
import important to talk about it today

446
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,000
because it's our lymphatic system it's

447
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,000
the very tool that's protecting us from

448
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,320
that and its best friend is the liver

449
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,720
and the liver's best friend is the

450
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,520
lymphatic system this is really

451
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,760
important to know so we're getting

452
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Exposed on every level with every

453
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,960
chemical agent possible that's being

454
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,160
created at a factories every new new

455
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,400
chemical created every day and we're

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,600
getting exposed bottom line from our dry

457
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
cleaners all the way to perfumes and

458
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,200
colog that are highly toxic all the way

459
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,520
from plugin air fresheners by the way

460
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,520
the air freshener world that should be

461
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,080
banned and outlawed if the world worked

462
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,559
in the right way meaning in the way of

463
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,080
looking out for people with chronic

464
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,159
illness looking out for people with

465
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,760
disease looking out for people to even

466
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,640
healthy people getting anything the

467
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,360
freshener world would disappear the air

468
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
freshener world that would disappear

469
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,039
that's actually one of the worst of them

470
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,320
for the liver lymphatic system for our

471
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:30,640
bodies so we're exposed to this nonstop

472
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,480
nonstop and um and so what do we do

473
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,679
about it if we can't do anything about

474
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,000
what we're exposed to when we walk into

475
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,559
the mall or wherever we go people aren't

476
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,720
going to the malls that much anyway

477
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,679
these days but we still get exposed

478
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,960
everywhere else what the bottom line is

479
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,360
whatever we're exposed we can't do

480
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,960
anything about that in in a lot of ways

481
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
except what we can control in our own in

482
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
personal or own personal

483
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,559
environment you know you better believe

484
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,520
you won't see me ordering or going to

485
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,600
the store and grabbing those plug-in air

486
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,640
fresheners you better believe you won't

487
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,360
be seeing me do that and plug that in my

488
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,039
house and ruin it or plug that in my

489
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,440
apartment plug that into my car you

490
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:13,440
wouldn't believe that's not going to

491
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,159
happen so we can control those things

492
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
you can throw those out you can unplug

493
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,960
those and throw those out you can

494
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,360
control those things and there's a lot

495
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,240
of other things you can control too so

496
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,080
that helps we can still get exposed

497
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
outside of our environment and guess

498
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,200
what suffers our lymphatic system our

499
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
health over over all and everything else

500
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,919
if you got a chronic illness any

501
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,159
symptoms any conditions your lymphatic

502
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:39,720
system is working double time double

503
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:42,240
time up to that's what it's doing double

504
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,720
time and your immune system your we

505
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,840
counts your killer cells your white

506
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,039
blood cells all those your lymphocytes

507
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,640
all the different varieties of the

508
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,360
immune system monocytes basophils

509
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,480
neutrophils I don't know all of them I

510
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,679
all those lymphocytes all of them that

511
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,159
what happens is that they're working

512
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,200
double time they're working hard they're

513
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,520
working hard in and around the lymphatic

514
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
system the ones that are in the

515
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,240
lymphatic system work hard in there the

516
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,679
ones that are outside the body are

517
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,640
working hard in there they're all

518
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,600
working hard everything's working hard

519
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,799
for you not against you your immune

520
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,159
system never goes against you ever ever

521
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:23,480
ever ever never goes against you a

522
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:27,120
raging virus like a flu virus real bad

523
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,559
one yeah that goes against you you know

524
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,039
other viruses go against against you

525
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,559
bacteria goes against you other things

526
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,200
like that but the immune system doesn't

527
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,919
it doesn't and it doesn't attack the

528
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
body it never attacks the body I have a

529
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,720
chapter in thyroid healing read it again

530
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,320
the autoimmune mistake the great mistake

531
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,320
the autoimmune Theory weit just read

532
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,919
that it I'm it's it's it says it all it

533
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,320
says it all so so what do we do what do

534
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,200
we do we want to protect our immune

535
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,760
system we want to protect our lymphatic

536
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,720
system you know how we talk about immune

537
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,880
system oh immune support oh immune

538
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,440
support oh immune system support oh no

539
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,880
build up your immune system oh

540
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,320
strengthen your immune system you know

541
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,840
how we do that right it's really like

542
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,159
lymphatic system support that's what we

543
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,840
need to be saying build up the lymphatic

544
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,120
system strengthen the lymphatic system

545
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,080
over here and that's what we should be

546
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,760
saying too that's really what we should

547
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,559
be saying it's really what we are saying

548
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,000
without realizing

549
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,559
it yeah I know I know this stuff's heavy

550
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,039
I told you I told you this stuff is

551
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:39,440
pretty heavy it is so talk about viruses

552
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,080
let's talk about viruses the Epstein bar

553
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,559
virus responsible for mono it's it the

554
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,720
lymphatic vessels always are under

555
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,200
attack with the beine bar right from the

556
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,240
first bout of somebody's mono to later

557
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,559
on just having epine bar and and and

558
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,559
living with it everybody lives with it

559
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,640
we have it in our system and it's causes

560
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,840
everything it causes fibromyalgia it

561
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,080
causes multiple sclerosis it causes

562
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,960
rheumatoid arthritis it causes a

563
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,679
tremendous amount of neurological system

564
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,960
symptoms that get passed off as Lyme

565
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,000
disease it causes lupus it causes um uh

566
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,720
chronic fatigue syndrome all of the new

567
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
chronic fatigue syndrome labels they can

568
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,120
keep on stamping out a new one and a new

569
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,760
one and new one me and on you know to um

570
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,919
intolerance resist and everything they

571
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,240
can just keep on bringing new names to

572
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,039
try to keep keep everybody thinking

573
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,840
research and sence got somewhere with

574
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,840
with chronic fatigue syndrome but they

575
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,840
haven't yet unless they learn a it's the

576
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,720
Epstein bar virus and B the body's not

577
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,880
attacking itself and C it's not genetic

578
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,520
and then and then let's talk once they

579
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,720
got that down then then then they're

580
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,039
playing on a normal playing field or a

581
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,760
truthful playing field

582
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,760
so the just the Epstein bar virus alone

583
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,520
and what it does in the problems it's

584
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,640
causing within the body the lymphatic

585
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,760
system is literally Target number one

586
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,520
and they they go into battle your

587
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,159
lymphocytes in your lymphatic system

588
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Epstein bar goes into the lymphatic

589
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,919
system and it it goes after it creates

590
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,279
these swollen lymph

591
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,080
nodes and the lymph nodes are trying to

592
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,840
destroy the epine bar that's where the

593
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,919
battle happens so much and so many

594
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,520
people and they get all the swollen

595
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,400
glands and a lot of kids with mono and

596
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,840
early mono symptoms they get the mumps

597
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,240
you know what the mumps is the mumps is

598
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,520
about of mono undiagnosed by the doctors

599
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,720
by research and science or medical

600
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,799
communities the MPS is Epstein bar

601
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,320
that's mono so when a kid gets the MPS

602
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,120
they when a child when a little girl or

603
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:48,640
a little boy gets the

604
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,440
MS that is Epstein bar that is aout of

605
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
mono that's what that is and that's the

606
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
you know and and that's what the

607
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,640
confusion is so when they give you you

608
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,000
know they give you that whole thing

609
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,520
about Ms it's not even correct it's not

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,840
even correct on any level it's not so Ms

611
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,919
that's what the whole Ms think that's

612
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,880
all lymphatic swelling that's a that

613
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,480
that virus is all the mono virus in that

614
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,960
lymphatic swelling right there that's

615
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,320
what that is and the lymphatic vessels

616
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,080
they're all wrapped up into that romatic

617
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,919
fever okay I mean that alone that's all

618
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,559
that's also epsteen bar um all of that

619
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,039
is and it's all involved with the with

620
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,200
the lymphatic system it's all inv

621
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,360
glandular fever that's mono glandular

622
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,799
fever they call it they call that in

623
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,960
different parts of the world glandular

624
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,279
fever and that's mono so I've seen bar

625
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,039
is the big one that the lymphatic system

626
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,720
is always up against and the lymphatic

627
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,399
system goes up against other viruses

628
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,880
viral situations without a

629
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,600
doubt but that

630
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,919
one Epstein bar and is is a big one for

631
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,640
all of that and so we get that when

632
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,960
we're younger the whole thing tonsilitis

633
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,399
tonsilitis is totally lymphatic it's

634
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,320
it's the tonsils that's what's that's

635
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:14,159
what what that's all what's around the

636
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,200
tonsils that's your lymphatic system

637
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:21,039
there it is tonsilitis is mono that's

638
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,559
Epstein bar tonsilitis they took a lot

639
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,919
of tonsils out of people and still do

640
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,480
without realizing that person has a bout

641
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,200
of mono

642
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,320
and the reason why they don't diagnose

643
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,159
it is because

644
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,720
misdiagnoses you know so a lot of

645
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,760
doctors don't know what they're looking

646
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,360
for don't know what they're looking at

647
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,880
happens all the time it's not their

648
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:46,120
fault that's one thing the other thing

649
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,720
is if you have a small bout of Epstein

650
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,520
bar or mono when you're young small bout

651
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,960
of mono when you're really

652
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,240
little when you get tonsilitis later a

653
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,080
little bit later on as a child it won't

654
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,600
register it the same way with your

655
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,440
immune system with the blood work the

656
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,640
finable blood work the the the the

657
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,120
faulty blood work system at the labs and

658
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,399
how we analyze blood you won't

659
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,279
understand the physician won't even

660
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,320
understand that this is a person's

661
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,080
second time having mono it's going to

662
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,039
look different in the blood work it's

663
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,880
going to be tonsilitis now and they

664
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,760
won't even have a clue at all at all

665
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,600
won't even have a clue and it's all

666
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,760
lymphatic system all around the

667
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,480
tonsils so these are just some examples

668
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,480
of how the lymphatic system works how

669
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,600
the tonsils work how your liver Works

670
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,640
how everything works all of it all of it

671
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,360
every last bit of it so and then there's

672
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,880
lymphodema lymphodema that can that

673
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,760
occur when lymphatic vessel swell

674
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,799
someone gets really viral and they get

675
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,120
viral inside the liver hhv6 undiscovered

676
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,240
nobody even knows you know they know

677
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,600
about hhv6 but they don't know that it

678
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,200
sits in the liver wreaking havoc all the

679
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,600
different shingles viruses that can sit

680
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,279
in the liver wreaking havoc hhv7

681
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,039
undiscovered 10 11 12 undiscovered 13

682
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,039
undiscovered 14 undiscovered 16

683
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:13,960
hhv6 and it goes on and it goes on so

684
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,120
and all these viruses the mutations

685
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,919
including different Epstein bars cyto

686
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,480
virus that's one too they all reside in

687
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:24,520
the liver and some Escape some Prosper

688
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
some turn into something some people

689
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,720
have less some people have more some

690
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,720
people only have the Epstein bar some

691
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,399
people have the

692
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,520
hhv6 some people have both the whole

693
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,880
thing is how it works and

694
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,480
then sometimes when we're immune system

695
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,640
is broken down we're not eating good

696
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,039
we're not taking care of ourselves we're

697
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,519
under a tremendous amount of stress we

698
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,320
have emotional hardships emotional

699
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,440
turmoil all these different things

700
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,039
losses all this stuff happens Financial

701
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,000
stress everything else and boom we're

702
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,880
getting chronic fatigue syndrome boom

703
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,720
we're getting lymphadema boom we're

704
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,279
getting Hashim modus

705
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,120
thyroiditis on our wedding day day yeah

706
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,840
seen that lots of times I've seen

707
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,799
weddings stress out a bride to such a

708
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,880
degree all the way to the point of

709
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,039
getting married and right after getting

710
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,000

thyroiditis and running to 10 three four

712
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,039
five different doctors and and and

713
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,440
handing handing over getting handed over

714
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,399

thyroiditis in fact on wedding days and

716
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,440
be right before wedding day right after

717
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,240
mostly right after because you know it's

718
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
's a high adrenaline thing going on and

this High adrenaline thing going on and

722
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,880
every money is totally going

723
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,799
crazy and not for everybody but for a

724
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,559
lot of people and then boom Hashimoto's

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,480
diagnosis for a 28 29y old 25y old bride

726
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,480
32y old very common happens all the time

727
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,039
I saw it all the time for years when I

728
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,399
was helping out people and it happens

729
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,000
now our immune system gets run down from

730
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:03,559
stress from adrenaline or whatever it is

731
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,559
whether it's a good thing bad thing

732
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,600
however it is we get worn out and then

733
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,600
we get susceptible susceptible to so

734
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,960
many different things because our liers

735
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,200
harboring some viral material or we pick

736
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,240
up a new virus and our lymphatic system

737
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,960
can't do the job it needs to do because

738
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,679
it's rund down it's zinc

739
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,360
deficient zinc deficient a zinc

740
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,039
deficiency is like the lymphatic

741
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,519
system's worst nightmare

742
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,679
and the liver's worst nightmare the one

743
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,240
thing and I'm going to I said this

744
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,760
before I'm going to say it again the one

745
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,240
thing and I have this even I've even I

746
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,799
even put this in thyroid healing a

747
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,320
section about this okay in the myths

748
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:47,240
chapter if you go check out that chapter

749
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,600
and you'll see I think it's chapter 21

750
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,679
or something or 22 one of those

751
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,360
chapters um I think it is don't don't

752
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,640
quote me on that yeah yeah just I just

753
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,120
you know I've just basically finished

754
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
another book that going to be releasing

755
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,320
at the end of the year so My my brain is

756
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,799
scrambled on that I might be thinking

757
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,799
chapter 21 of my my my newest book

758
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,880
that's going to be coming out so anyway

759
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:16,240
the bottom line is zinc it's it's it's

760
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,960
the most precious thing for our body and

761
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,720
there's it's under attack by

762
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,279
misinformation that's just this is what

763
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,640
I talk about trendy traps you want to

764
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,880
know why I gave that little speech at

765
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,480
the beginning of the show trendy traps

766
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,440
okay because trendy trap per one is the

767
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,720
zinc fear zinc fear okay you you don't

768
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,080
have to OD on zinc by any means but

769
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,760
we're so deficient in it it's not even

770
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,600
in our food anymore our lymphatic system

771
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,080
is desperate for it a few tiny drops of

772
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,159
zinc every day can do miracles for

773
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,880
protecting you so that you don't end up

774
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,399
with Hashimoto thyroiditis on your

775
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,120
wedding day which I've seen so many

776
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,559
times if I only saw that once I would

777
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,840
never mention it I would never mention

778
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,760
that it's I would never go there if I

779
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,960
only saw that once I saw it dozens and

780
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,480
dozens of times over the years just

781
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,440
letting you know that's why I'm saying

782
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,120
it and I'll use other examples I'll I'll

783
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
switch to another example I've seen so

784
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,039
many times too and um well graduation

785
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,960
for college students you know you're

786
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,399
finishing up you're finishing up um

787
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,799
college and and you get the worst case

788
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,760
Amano you're finishing up college and

789
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,240
you get tonsilitis you finish up College

790
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
and and you get you know you get

791
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,880
something else you get severe chronic

792
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,519
fatigue you get hashimotos it's

793
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,320
happening now in all the kids the kids

794
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,840
at 22 23 years old young women

795
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,600
especially so I've seen that if I didn't

796
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,480
see that dozens and dozens dozens time I

797
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,960
wouldn't mention that either it'd be

798
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,600
this obscure one

799
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,360
time but anyway the bottom line is the

800
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,600
zinc could actually stop all that if you

801
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,960
have it on enough in you so you know I

802
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,519
always do for myself personally I always

803
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,720
take like one dropper full of zinc every

804
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,960
day one dropper full of zinc every day

805
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,960
of the right kind of zinc you can go to

806
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,679
the medical medium directory um on my

807
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,840
website find out which things are the

808
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,639
best but I do one droper full every day

809
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,960
and it you know it helps me and helps

810
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,120
protect me in my system I mean I talk to

811
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Spirit about it all the time I want to

812
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,559
keep my lymphatic system strong my white

813
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,679
count strong I want because what does

814
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,039
the white blood count what does it

815
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,360
consist of is its most important mineral

816
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,080
out of all the minerals that it runs on

817
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,240
zinc and that's the main one that's the

818
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,880
main one so when we go zinc fear because

819
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,200
we think it's going to eliminate copper

820
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,240
we're so high in Copper food is so high

821
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,679
in Copper you eat one avocado you

822
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,159
wouldn't believe the amount of Trace

823
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,039
copper in one avocado there's no zinc in

824
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,080
anything there's no zinc it's gone it's

825
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,559
it's gone and partly because in the old

826
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,360
days when DDT was spread on the planet

827
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,399
in the old days and spread all through

828
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,399
the US and all over the planet and still

829
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:13,159
is in Parts DDT had a reaction in the

830
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:16,639
soil it canceled out zinc and DDT is

831
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:19,080
still in soils all organic farms even

832
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:20,279
have traces of it without without

833
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,720
because they're not testing for that

834
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:25,320
they don't even look for that it's it no

835
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,559
one there's not no one's testing for

836
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,039
that it's not but it's everywhere it's

837
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,039
the the world is dusted with it so you

838
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,760
can't you can't worry about you still

839
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,279
got to eat organic produce you ra better

840
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,559
eat organic produce than eating all the

841
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,639
time conventional produce unless it's

842
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,399
your only option um but the whole point

843
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:44,240
is it's dusted everywhere it's dusted in

844
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,480
all the fields that grass-fed cows are

845
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,279
raised on it still dusted they use it it

846
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,600
blows across continents they're using it

847
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:56,480
all all in other all in other countries

848
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,840
as if it was if if Z was safe and fine

849
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,600
and D

850
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,720
and what it does it blows everywhere it

851
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,600
lands on all the fields the cows are

852
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,679
grazing it lands on

853
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,879
everything and what does it do it has a

854
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,639
clashing effect it has a critical

855
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,040
interaction effect that nobody knows

856
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,760
about an interaction effect is it

857
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,720
literally destroys zinc so when it rains

858
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,679
and it rains those particles those fine

859
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,040
DDT particles and it rins them and

860
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,280
saturates them into the Earth everywhere

861
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,399
nothing's not free from it it's one of

862
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,359
those diabolical things that occurred on

863
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,520
the planet thank God it's it's at least

864
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:40,119
controlled here in the US and not

865
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,879
freshly used even though it's new

866
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,320
cousins in the pesticide world the nerv

867
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,720
asde world and funus side world are just

868
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,760
are rampant which are horrific enough

869
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,240
but thank God this isn't being used

870
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,679
fresh even though it's being used fresh

871
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,079
in other continents and blowing over but

872
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,200
it destroys zinc it destroys zinc in our

873
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,680
body it destroys zinc in the Earth and

874
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,640
we have DDT passed from our forefather

875
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
from our grandfather and grandmothers

876
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,240
you don't think you don't think that's

877
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,640
possible think again think

878
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,280
again yeah I don't you know look if it

879
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,839
if living in the dark and not knowing

880
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,079
these things makes you feel better and

881
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,599
that's what you have to do then I

882
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,200
respect that one one bit you I mean 100%

883
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,000
I expect it I mean you know I expect it

884
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,240
in a lot of people but I respect it

885
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,079
100% because you know I've I've had

886
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,040
people tell me I don't want to know I

887
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,480
don't want to know I don't know I don't

888
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,280
want to know what's going on out there

889
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,119
really I just want to be safe and just

890
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,040
not really think about it so try not to

891
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,960
tell me too much so I'm up all night

892
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,400
I've had people tell me that I

893
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,400
understand and I and I totally honor

894
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,079
that but the deal is we inherit the DDT

895
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,720
DDT is inside the liver it kills the

896
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,400
zinc Factory in our liver because our

897
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,440
liver resides and needs zinc it

898
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,280
functions on zinc it wants zinc it

899
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,040
manufactures even zinc when it can it

900
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,319
does it all the liver does it all so

901
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:04,079
what happens is is we have no zinc in

902
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:06,079
us it's really really really low if

903
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,079
non-existent for a lot of people so

904
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,200
taking a couple of tiny drops every now

905
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,839
and then could be a wonderful thing

906
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,880
protect your lymphatic system from

907
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,560
viruses so you don't end up with a case

908
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,599
of fibromyalgia which is a later stage

909
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,480
Epstein

910
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,920
bar but you know what science of

911
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,760
research thinks fibromyalgia is a case

912
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,599
of overactive nerves you know what the

913
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,119
alternative movement thinks fibromyalgia

914
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,599
is the body attacking

915
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,400
itself you know what geneticists think

916
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,880
fibromyalgia is

917
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,680
genetic God and here we are in this day

918
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,680
and age yep here we are would you

919
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,319
believe it it's

920
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,800
1905 it's 19 actually they knew more

921
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,000
about chronic illness probably in 1905 I

922
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,520
hate to say it they probably did so okay

923
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,680
so the bottom line is we wanted get some

924
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
zinc in there you can't worry about

925
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,400
about canceling out copper everything's

926
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,680
high in Copper the soil's high in Copper

927
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,400
oh dear lord everything is we also have

928
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,160
destructive copper like saturated in our

929
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,400
bodies we're high in Copper everybody

930
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,440

low in

962
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,000
zinc you're low in zinc why am I big on

963
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,640
zinc today in this show because the

964
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,200
lymphatic system needs it it needs it to

965
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,040
stay healthy do you need to take a lot

966
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,000
of it no have I taken a lot of it at

967
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,680
times yeah zinc shock therapy okay

968
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,720
that's something that Spirit created was

969
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,920
Zinc shock therapy zinc shock therapy is

970
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,880
incredible saved me on a trip saved me

971
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,560
on a trip years ago it's coming down

972
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,760
with a flu spirit said you're coming

973
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,000
down with a flu you're rundown you

00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,160
haven't slept you're traveling you're on

975
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,560
planes left and right I spent more time

976
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,960
in the air than I did on the ground I

977
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,119
did on the ground for a little while in

978
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,400
my life oh I spent more time in the air

979
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,280
more time in the air I wasn't eating as

980
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,920
good as I could I didn't have it in

981
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,760
front of me so I was just scrapping for

982
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,000
for for scr was scaming for any anything

00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,440
healthy I could find was run down no

984
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,119
sleep whatsoever I was also under

985
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,599
tremendous stress not just because

986
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,400
because spirit's talking to me 24/7 to

987
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,319
help others all the time I was under

988
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,119
tremendous amounts of stress I had some

989
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:45,400
deadlines I had some other things going

990
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,599
on I also was trying to help a couple of

991
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,200
family members I was do I was just

992
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,960
pushed to the Max and exposed way too

993
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,520
much to a lot of

994
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,440
germs I was visiting I was visiting the

995
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,640
hospital visiting some family members I

996
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,520
was I had people coughing on me left and

997
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,599
right I was exposed to everything and

998
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,599
was back up in the air again and what

999
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,240
happened with no sleep in me is coming

1000
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,680
down with the flu and spirit said zinc

1001
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,480
shock therapy right away and I had a

1002
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,440
bottle of zinc on me couldn't believe it

1003
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,720
I squirted four or five dropper fs and

1004
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,960
because I'm not sensitive to zinc if

1005
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,240
you're sensitive to zinc just like

1006
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,119
you're sensitive you could be sensitive

1007
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,359
to anything you start with a couple of

1008
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,160
tiny drops you know just a couple of

1009
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,520
honey drops that's all you need I did

1010
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,880
four or five dropper Falls Bam Bam Bam

1011
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,520
right in the throat I let it sit in the

1012
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,960
throat spirit said let it sit in the

1013
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,359
throat for 2 minutes I let it sit in the

1014
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,160
throat for 2 minutes I had it sitting in

1015
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,720
there my lymphatic system was sucking it

1016
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,760
up like never before just absorbing it

1017
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,920
like sucking it up like just bringing it

1018
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,640
right in right into it getting all

1019
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,599
through my lymphatic system the whole

1020
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:57,079
bit you better believe it okay I woke up

1021
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,839
the next morning it was gone spirit said

1022
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,599
you did it you conquered it one shot

1023
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:05,520
with zinc with zinc shock therapy

1024
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:08,200
conquered everybody else around me

1025
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,319
they're you know hop on the plank

1026
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,480
everybody coffin everything and Bam Zing

1027
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,240
shock therapy totally caught it in

1028
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,040
time and you know and I had some zinc in

1029
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,680
me already cuz you know I took it

1030
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,520
randomly that's why I even had it on me

1031
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,319
I took it once in a while I had it on me

1032
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,040
cuz I knew about S I knew about

1033
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,040
lymphatic system I knew about this from

1034
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,319
Spirit and I wasn't in fear of it fear

1035
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,040
of it eliminating my copper reserves

1036
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,200
because there's always plenty of copper

1037
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,720
reserves you eat one avocado you're just

1038
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,000
building back your copper reserves in

1039
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,200
one shot that's how much copper is in

1040
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,720
avocado I mean it's good for you you eat

1041
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,839
avocados it's good for you but that

1042
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,200
that's how much is in there so all this

1043
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,920
is important to know so let's just run

1044
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,480
by some foods for the lymphatic system

1045
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,119
help the liver too and the liver gets so

1046
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,880
clogged up and it's so loaded with

1047
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,000
poison and toxins so much debris and

1048
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,800
it's saturated inside the liver and the

1049
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,720
liver is just puffing it out back into

1050
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,359
the bloodstream because it has no other

1051
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,520
no other way of handling it it's so

1052
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,839
overloaded stagnant sluggish livers high

1053
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,520
fat diets no oxygen inside the blood

1054
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:15,319
because you're on a trendy high-fat diet

1055
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,359
or a standard American high-fat diet

1056
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,680
you're on Either Ore you know and and

1057
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,319
you're not eating enough fruits and

1058
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,319
vegetables people should people should

1059
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:27,079
switch

1060
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,400
gears they should switch gears sometimes

1061
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,079
to really help themselves bring in more

1062
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,760
fruits and vegetables so what can we do

1063
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,359
for the lymphatic system fruit is one of

1064
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,440
the greatest weapons for the lymphatic

1065
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:38,920
system I'll say it again I said it

1066
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,720
before apples are incredible pears are

1067
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,520
great peaches nectarines plums cherries

1068
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,680
are really incredible for the lymphatic

1069
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,000
system they're great melons watermelon

1070
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,520
regular melon honeydew melon um you name

1071
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,640
it those are all those are all great for

1072
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,720
the lymphatic system okay so you know

1073
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,480
that that alone green juice celery juice

1074
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,319
is by far probably the greatest weapon

1075
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,599
for the lymphatic system because the the

1076
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,520
the Undiscovered cluster salts that

1077
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,640
nobody knows about the the highly

1078
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,000
mineralized cluster salts that are

1079
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,559
undiscovered in the sense that they're

1080
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,960
not studied no one's seen it no one

1081
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,920
knows what's going on no one knows how

1082
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,400
they work they strip off viruses the

1083
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,400
cell membranes and destroy viruses they

1084

you like it won't hurt at all like I

1326
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,559
said the G Ginger turmeric shots or

1327
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,359
ginger tea every day incredible for the

1328
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,559
lymphatic system that's another option

1329
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:24,000
and the list goes on for the lymphatic

1330
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:26,000
system you can't go wrong I like melons

1331
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
in the morning first thing

1332
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,760
so here's what I do I'll do a melon in

1333
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,400
the morning I'll do my celery juice a

1334
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,040
little bit later on that's that's what I

1335
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,520
do try not to eat a lot of melon first

1336
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,640
thing in the morning because you know

1337
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,559
you're just going to get filled up

1338
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,640
you're going to have you're just going

1339
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,880
to be filled up I mean I've eaten a

1340
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,839
whole melon in the morning or two whole

1341
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,280
melons in the morning you know and if

1342
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,839
you got someplace to go you're going to

1343
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,760
be peeing everywhere so you know just

1344
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,400
because it's going to be cleansing you

1345
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,880
but I like some melon or I'll do celery

1346
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,599
juice first thing after lemon water so

1347
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
let me just you let me back up I I like

1348
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,280
doing my lemon water then I like doing

1349
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,040
my celery juice and another thing then I

1350
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,480
do the the melons too you can do it that

1351
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,160
way depending on where you're going

1352
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
lately I did I've been doing the melons

1353
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,799
first thing but I know that my

1354
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,520
schedule's changing so I'm doing them

1355
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:14,440
later and so get the melons because the

1356
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,440
melons really help also with the

1357
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,319
lymphatic system don't be afraid of

1358
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,920
those papaya that's a secret weapon

1359
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,680
against the lymphatic system too helps

1360
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,839
clean it up notice how I'm not saying

1361
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,880
chicken fish um animal meat pork and

1362
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,480
turkey

1363
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,119
does nothing for the lymphatic system

1364
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I'm not saying you have to stop it I'm

1365
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,000
saying if you're concerned about your

1366
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,520
liver concerned about your lymphatic

1367
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,400
system try to go on the 28 day cleanse

1368
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,440
out of book one or the 90-day cleanse

1369
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,119
out of thyroid healing or try to just

1370
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,599
limit your M you know lower your animal

1371
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,000
proteins a little bit so you can clear

1372
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,480
out your lymphatic system and liver

1373
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,880
because all the high fat from the

1374
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,160
chicken and high fat from the chicken

1375
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,839
breast the white chicken breast the all

1376
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,359
high fat from the white pork the white

1377
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,880
pork meat whatever the white meat the

1378
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,760
pork all that fat from the turkey all

1379
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,640
that fat from the grass-fed beef even

1380
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,000
the lanest cuts of beef all that fat

1381
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,480
burdens down the lymphatic system and

1382
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,880
the liers take it and if you're vegan or

1383
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,839
plant-based lower than nuts too many

1384
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,760
nuts and seeds too many nut Butters and

1385
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,559
too much coconut oil is going to get in

1386
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,559
the way of the lymphatic system a little

1387
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,599
bit is fine just lower that down a

1388
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,720
little bit and bring up all the fruits

1389
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,640
and bring up the vegetables bring up the

1390
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,280
things I just said bring in the berock

1391
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,960
rout te you name it we're running out of

1392
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,599
time you guys are the greatest I have to

1393
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,880
say and this is this was a fun show

1394
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,520
rebounding could be really good for the

1395
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,760
lymphatic system pulls and draws a lot

1396
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,960
of poisons out of there but you got to

1397
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,200
be hydrated you got to be hydrated so

1398
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,799
that's what all this is about that's

1399
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,960
what you know the the that's what all

1400
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,799

1403
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,160
helps hydration is really important so

1404
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,799
the rebounding the rebounder that's

1405
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,720
amazing jump up and down on it an

1406
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:51,200
infrared sauna that's even a good thing

1407
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,160
too it's really helpful for for the

1408
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,559
