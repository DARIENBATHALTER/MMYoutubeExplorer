[422.72 - 426.88] about guessing games it's not about
[424.64 - 429.44] mysteries this is about knowing why
[426.88 - 431.36] we're sick we're doing day two of the
[429.44 - 434.00] medical medium
[431.36 - 438.24] morning cleanse challenge
[434.00 - 439.68] so i want to talk about this thing right
[438.24 - 442.88] what's the first thing you think when
[439.68 - 442.88] you see a homeless person
[443.28 - 448.40] first thing i think is what what is
[445.12 - 450.48] their health condition right
[448.40 - 453.12] because i just feel awful
[450.48 - 453.12] for them right
[454.00 - 457.76] another thing i'll think is
[456.48 - 459.92] right
[457.76 - 459.92] is
[460.16 - 466.32] there in some pretty dirty clothes
[462.84 - 468.16] okay and
[466.32 - 471.28] their clothes haven't been washed in a
[468.16 - 471.28] very long time
[471.60 - 478.72] god knows when they've had a bath
[474.32 - 480.16] and you just feel bad for them right
[478.72 - 482.96] and
[480.16 - 482.96] the next thing is
[483.12 - 486.08] you know
[484.56 - 488.00] anybody's like oh well we don't have
[486.08 - 489.36] that in common right we're always taking
[488.00 - 490.96] care of ourselves we're always washing
[489.36 - 492.88] our clothes we're taking showers we're
[490.96 - 495.04] taking baths
[492.88 - 497.20] we don't have that in common but we do
[495.04 - 498.80] have something in common
[497.20 - 500.48] outside of being a human because
[498.80 - 502.00] homeless people they're humans too
[500.48 - 504.88] obviously even though they're not
[502.00 - 504.88] treated like that
[505.52 - 511.68] what we have in common is
[508.32 - 515.52] we can get dirty on the inside
[511.68 - 515.52] we can get dirty on the inside
[516.08 - 522.72] all the trash gets built it built up on
[518.96 - 522.72] the inside is what it does
[522.96 - 526.72] you guys get what i'm saying right
[527.60 - 533.44] i know people they're squeaky clean
[531.36 - 536.16] squeaky clean so much it annoys me
[533.44 - 537.84] because i go weeks without showering or
[536.16 - 539.68] bathing when i'm finishing the book
[537.84 - 541.92] deadline and i'm laying on my office
[539.68 - 544.80] floor tongue hanging out of my mouth
[541.92 - 548.72] after working 72 hours with three hours
[544.80 - 549.60] of sleep trying to make the deadline
[548.72 - 552.96] but

[556.72 - 560.64] i want some clean clothes right a little
[558.56 - 563.44] bit but the point is

[572.16 - 574.80] point is

[577.36 - 581.92] tell you
[579.60 - 581.92] okay
[583.92 - 588.00] i know people that are squeaky clean i
[586.16 - 590.48] mean i'm talking
[588.00 - 591.36] they're like scrubbed head down to their
[590.48 - 593.68] toe
[591.36 - 597.76] they shower twice a day
[593.68 - 597.76] but their insides are disgusting
[598.00 - 602.68] their insides are gnarly
[606.40 - 611.76] the outside might be clean the inside

[782.40 - 787.60] you can tank and actually get like feel
[784.88 - 789.52] like you just had some hearty fuel which
[787.60 - 792.64] is really awesome
[789.52 - 796.24] okay really important now this recipe
[792.64 - 798.72] is then cleanse the heel right here okay
[796.24 - 800.96] we all can afford this or the basics at
[798.72 - 803.36] least thank god goodman says goodman
[800.96 - 804.56] girl says
[803.36 - 806.56] incredible
[804.56 - 808.32] incredible so we're here right now we're
[806.56 - 810.00] live you guys just in case people think
[808.32 - 813.44] it's actually recorded actually we're
[810.00 - 816.08] live jan mcbride says but don't potatoes
[813.44 - 817.60] have high glycemic index that can cause
[816.08 - 820.48] alzheimer's
[817.60 - 823.12] no but that's misinformation
[820.48 - 825.92] from people in the health industry that
[823.12 - 828.40] will cheat you jan out of healing so
[825.92 - 829.92] someday you do get alzheimer's and
[828.40 - 832.56] that's what that is that's
[829.92 - 834.56] misinformation out there in the world
[832.56 - 837.76] and it's really sad
[834.56 - 840.80] it's sad what they do out there okay so
[837.76 - 842.80] potatoes are a healing food and when
[840.80 - 844.40] they rob people of that information it's
[842.80 - 846.00] really sad because
[844.40 - 848.00] how are they going to heal
[846.00 - 851.60] what's incredible is alzheimer's is on
[848.00 - 852.40] the rise and and it's rising fast right
[851.60 - 855.36] and
[852.40 - 857.84] potatoes not on the big list for people
[855.36 - 860.24] to actually eat you know people with
[857.84 - 862.32] alzheimer's don't eat potatoes
[860.24 - 865.12] people dying of alzheimer's aren't on a
[862.32 - 867.12] potato diet did you guys know that
[865.12 - 868.84] people on alzheimer's
[867.12 - 871.04] all right are on
[868.84 - 872.16] butter they're on
[871.04 - 874.32] cream
[872.16 - 876.40] they're on oil
[874.32 - 878.56] right
[876.40 - 880.64] they're on chicken
[878.56 - 882.56] they're on chicken soup
[880.64 - 883.92] yeah people with alzheimer's dying are
[882.56 - 885.36] on chicken soups you know that's like
[883.92 - 887.52] one of the recommended things they could
[885.36 - 888.96] be on as chicken soup imagine that
[887.52 - 891.04] you're losing your mind
[888.96 - 893.44] you're getting sicker by the month
[891.04 - 894.80] and you're eating chicken soup
[893.44 - 896.00] i know i know everybody swears by
[894.80 - 898.80] chicken soup but i'm just trying to tell
[896.00 - 901.68] you it doesn't fix alzheimer's
[898.80 - 903.68] no one's on potatoes with alzheimer's no
[901.68 - 905.92] one's on oranges with alzheimer's no
[903.68 - 908.24] one's on papaya with alzheimer's i can
[905.92 - 910.64] guarantee you that there isn't alzheimer
[908.24 - 913.28] patients out there on papaya getting
[910.64 - 915.52] their mind back there's not alzheimer
[913.28 - 918.08] patients doing the medical media morning
[915.52 - 919.52] cleanse usually they're not you know
[918.08 - 921.12] unless they learned about it through a
[919.52 - 922.72] family member family member takes the
[921.12 - 924.48] medical mean warning cleanse to their
[922.72 - 927.12] elder who has alzheimer's and that's a
[924.48 - 929.52] different story but normally it just
[927.12 - 931.28] doesn't work that way can potatoes cause
[929.52 - 933.92] constipation
[931.28 - 935.60] uh no they can't so what i'm doing is
[933.92 - 936.80] i'm gonna get some potatoes out now that
[935.60 - 937.84] are steamed they're gonna go in the
[936.80 - 939.28] skillet
[937.84 - 940.72] we're gonna get them going over here
[939.28 - 942.96] we're just cooking this down a little
[940.72 - 942.96] bit
[944.32 - 948.48] what causes constipation is an inflamed
[946.72 - 949.68] intestinal tract it's why we're even
[948.48 - 952.24] doing this you should listen to the
[949.68 - 955.12] potato podcast at medical medium podcast
[952.24 - 958.16] at apple podcast so
[955.12 - 959.04] an inflamed intestinal tract right here
[958.16 - 961.44] okay
[959.04 - 963.84] an inflamed intestinal tract
[961.44 - 965.76] is why people have constipation so
[963.84 - 967.68] that's important to know
[965.76 - 969.20] so what you do is you have to realize if
[967.68 - 970.16] you're inflamed
[969.20 - 971.92] but first of all you're gonna have a
[970.16 - 974.32] sluggish liver if you're inflamed all in
[971.92 - 976.24] there and you have constipation that's
[974.32 - 978.56] first first and foremost to understand
[976.24 - 980.32] it's critical information right there
[978.56 - 981.92] but if you have inflammation somewhere
[980.32 - 984.72] inside your intestinal tract your small
[981.92 - 986.48] intestinal tract your ilium if you have
[984.72 - 988.56] if you have inflammation in your helium
[986.48 - 990.08] down in here on the right hand side okay
[988.56 - 991.84] where you're where your small intestinal
[990.08 - 993.76] tract links into your
[991.84 - 995.04] large large intestinal tract if you're
[993.76 - 997.20] inflamed in here that's where the
[995.04 - 999.12] constipation comes from
[997.20 - 1000.56] ninety percent of constipation cases are
[999.12 - 1002.96] because you're actually sick you've got
[1000.56 - 1005.84] an inflammation going on here
[1002.96 - 1008.64] so potato doesn't cause constipation
[1005.84 - 1010.80] but other foods like dairy products and
[1008.64 - 1012.40] butter and stuff like that will cause
[1010.80 - 1014.16] and gluten too because it'll feed
[1012.40 - 1016.08] whatever the inflammation is causing
[1014.16 - 1019.20] this whatever the bugs are it's causing
[1016.08 - 1020.88] that helium to be inflamed right there
[1019.20 - 1023.28] i want to answer questions you guys i
[1020.88 - 1026.72] want to be as helpful as i possibly can
[1023.28 - 1026.72] so i'm excited about this
[1027.44 - 1030.00] so we're in the morning cleanse
[1028.64 - 1031.60] challenge so let's talk about it a
[1030.00 - 1033.28] little bit did you guys do your lemon
[1031.60 - 1037.52] water 16
[1033.28 - 1040.72] to 32 ounces of lemon water okay

[1078.96 - 1082.56] critical shape but for some reason

[1082.56 - 1087.76] before the people that are really sick
[1085.36 - 1089.44] that's what they're famous for

[1485.12 - 1490.16] you can still cleanse
[1487.20 - 1492.72] if you ate this before noon

[1522.64 - 1528.56] so we're dicing these potatoes up okay

[1528.56 - 1533.20] lot of you guys think you have to cook

[1548.00 - 1552.16] which is the potato skillet we're about
[1550.16 - 1553.68] to make a little celery juice too so we
[1552.16 - 1554.64] got a lot of great stuff we're doing
[1553.68 - 1556.72] okay
[1554.64 - 1557.76] i'm going to throw another potato in
[1556.72 - 1560.32] this
[1557.76 - 1560.32] skillet
[1562.00 - 1567.60] now with lemon water you can't have the
[1564.48 - 1569.60] lemon water hot you can't put lemon in
[1567.60 - 1572.08] hot water i need you guys to know that
[1569.60 - 1575.28] this is really important to understand
[1572.08 - 1575.28] critical tip right there
[1576.24 - 1580.32] okay
[1577.60 - 1583.04] you can't do
[1580.32 - 1585.44] you can't do the hot water lemon thing
[1583.04 - 1587.52] and cleanse so when you wake up first
[1585.44 - 1590.80] thing thing in the morning and you have
[1587.52 - 1593.68] your 16 to 32 ounces of of lemon water
[1590.80 - 1595.92] to flush your liver and flush your body
[1593.68 - 1598.40] right
[1595.92 - 1601.92] when you're flushing that liver first
[1598.40 - 1601.92] thing in the morning okay
[1603.28 - 1607.76] you can't put your lemon juice
[1606.64 - 1610.84] in
[1607.76 - 1612.72] hot water so you can't put your
[1610.84 - 1613.76] living
[1612.72 - 1615.60] okay
[1613.76 - 1617.92] living hydrating
[1615.60 - 1619.84] calcium rich trace mineral rich
[1617.92 - 1622.96] phytochemical compound rich
[1619.84 - 1624.72] juice lemon juice in hot water or you
[1622.96 - 1626.88] kill
[1624.72 - 1629.60] you kill what's in here
[1626.88 - 1631.60] and then it won't flush now you can have
[1629.60 - 1633.68] tea if you want you want herbal tea and
[1631.60 - 1635.28] put lemon in there that's perfectly fine
[1633.68 - 1636.72] but it's not going to be a flushing
[1635.28 - 1639.20] agent it's just going to be something
[1636.72 - 1641.20] else which is what you can do that's a
[1639.20 - 1644.16] different story
[1641.20 - 1646.64] someone asked on tick tock why no no why
[1644.16 - 1648.72] no nutritional yeast
[1646.64 - 1651.68] nutritional yeast
[1648.72 - 1653.76] is toxic yeast is toxic
[1651.68 - 1655.76] so we're not supposed to be consuming or
[1653.76 - 1660.00] eating yeast okay
[1655.76 - 1661.52] so yeast contains msg right
[1660.00 - 1663.04] don't get confused you're going to think
[1661.52 - 1665.52] well no that's not true because i keep
[1663.04 - 1668.16] on looking up on google
[1665.52 - 1669.92] on google right
[1668.16 - 1672.56] i'm on google here
[1669.92 - 1674.96] nutritional yeast is really good for us
[1672.56 - 1676.48] it offers so many fortified vitamins and
[1674.96 - 1678.48] nutrients
[1676.48 - 1679.92] and it's great for your kids too look
[1678.48 - 1682.72] here's a mom
[1679.92 - 1684.96] putting nutritional yeast
[1682.72 - 1686.80] on her children's food making a nice
[1684.96 - 1689.68] recipe of nutritional yeast
[1686.80 - 1691.60] and she's a very healthy looking mom
[1689.68 - 1693.12] and she's all happy and the kids are
[1691.60 - 1694.72] eating their treats and it's all great
[1693.12 - 1696.80] they got nutritional yeast in there what
[1694.72 - 1697.52] people don't realize
[1696.80 - 1700.32] is
[1697.52 - 1702.56] it damages the brain over time it
[1700.32 - 1704.56] weakens the brain
[1702.56 - 1707.36] nutritional yeast has glutamic acid
[1704.56 - 1709.44] naturally occurring but it's a bad bad
[1707.36 - 1710.80] glutamic acid it's an irritant on the
[1709.44 - 1712.48] central nervous system so if you've got
[1710.80 - 1714.32] chronic illness nutritional yeast will
[1712.48 - 1716.72] send you downhill
[1714.32 - 1718.08] it will stop you from healing
[1716.72 - 1719.68] so that's just one thing about

[2287.44 - 2293.76] you can still cleanse
[2290.08 - 2296.56] how is that possible well one reason is

[2296.56 - 2303.44] you had your celery juice
[2300.00 - 2306.08] you're not eating pork
[2303.44 - 2308.48] you're not eating oil

[2317.84 - 2321.68] know but you put your but it's still a
[2319.44 - 2324.08] fat and it stops you from cleansing

[2324.08 - 2332.00] having nut butters right
[2327.92 - 2334.16] you're having a fat free meal and guess
[2332.00 - 2336.08] what for everybody worried about insulin
[2334.16 - 2338.08] resistance

[2490.64 - 2494.24] joy clark says
[2492.32 - 2496.72] it's heartbreaking that i have trust
[2494.24 - 2498.96] issues with my doctors
[2496.72 - 2501.68] my nutritionists why are they not
[2498.96 - 2504.16] helping us they say insulin is from
[2501.68 - 2506.48] carbs to sugar anything you put in your
[2504.16 - 2507.52] body spikes insulin please help me have
[2506.48 - 2509.44] faith
[2507.52 - 2511.92] so joey clark this is how it works it's
[2509.44 - 2514.16] not sugar that gives somebody insulin
[2511.92 - 2516.16] resistance it's fat so it's fat in their
[2514.16 - 2518.80] bloodstream so what they don't realize
[2516.16 - 2521.36] it and this is why diabetics stay sick
[2518.80 - 2523.68] and stay sick and stay sick you can get
[2521.36 - 2525.92] rid of type 2 diabetes that's the
[2523.68 - 2527.76] easiest thing you can do it's it's if
[2525.92 - 2528.96] someone came to me
[2527.76 - 2531.12] right
[2528.96 - 2533.68] and they were like i got this type 2
[2531.12 - 2537.12] diabetes what do i do it's like
[2533.68 - 2540.08] you can say the magic word and it's gone
[2537.12 - 2541.84] you just have to do a few things you
[2540.08 - 2544.08] have to keep the fats out of the diet
[2541.84 - 2546.16] for a little bit you have to bring in
[2544.08 - 2548.24] other foods i talk about this in the
[2546.16 - 2551.28] medical medium books right and you can
[2548.24 - 2553.52] get rid of diabetes i mean it's really
[2551.28 - 2555.76] easy to get rid of type 2 diabetes
[2553.52 - 2558.32] that's just boom gone
[2555.76 - 2560.08] important to know i mean
[2558.32 - 2562.40] they don't have it right it's why
[2560.08 - 2565.04] everybody stays sick
[2562.40 - 2567.28] sugar's what is what your brain
[2565.04 - 2569.36] has to thrive and live on you know a
[2567.28 - 2570.80] diabetic that falls into a diabetic you
[2569.36 - 2573.60] know pass out
[2570.80 - 2575.44] a diabetic diabetic pass out on you know
[2573.60 - 2578.88] a football field or
[2575.44 - 2581.76] or on a baseball diamond or in a bus or
[2578.88 - 2583.60] just in a hallway somewhere in a school
[2581.76 - 2585.52] the only way to revive them is to put a
[2583.60 - 2587.44] little orange juice in their mouth
[2585.52 - 2588.80] because their brain has to get a little
[2587.44 - 2590.88] bit of sugar
[2588.80 - 2592.40] so you have to know that they have it
[2590.88 - 2593.28] wrong about diabetes
[2592.40 - 2595.20] and
[2593.28 - 2597.28] cleansing is just you know it's a part
[2595.20 - 2598.88] of it is you you have to cleanse out all
[2597.28 - 2600.72] the bad stuff you have to give your
[2598.88 - 2601.68] liver a break your pancreas a break and
[2600.72 - 2603.36] that's what the morning cleanse
[2601.68 - 2606.00] challenge does so it takes somebody to
[2603.36 - 2607.52] that place of healing so that's the dish
[2606.00 - 2609.12] right there let's keep on moving i mean
[2607.52 - 2611.20] there's a lot of information i can drop
[2609.12 - 2613.92] on diabetes but we we don't have the
[2611.20 - 2615.60] time get the books so that you have that
[2613.92 - 2617.68] information so you can learn how to heal
[2615.60 - 2619.28] completely with that
[2617.68 - 2620.88] so we're doing a liver rescue smoothie
[2619.28 - 2623.52] but i want to actually just strain this
[2620.88 - 2623.52] really quick
[2624.16 - 2628.24] so this is the celery juice we just used
[2629.76 - 2635.68] if you guys
[2632.56 - 2638.40] just if you guys throw everything out
[2635.68 - 2642.00] everything you're learning here
[2638.40 - 2643.52] and you just do your celery juice
[2642.00 - 2645.28] the needle moves
[2643.52 - 2647.68] just that alone right
[2645.28 - 2649.52] if you throw everything out here and you
[2647.68 - 2650.88] just do the liver rescue smoothie i'm
[2649.52 - 2653.52] gonna make you
[2650.88 - 2655.44] you'll move the needle
[2653.52 - 2657.84] if you throw everything out here and
[2655.44 - 2660.16] just do the lemon water every single
[2657.84 - 2662.48] morning you'll move the needle in some
[2660.16 - 2664.64] way somehow medical medium tools are
[2662.48 - 2666.64] powerful and when they're all combined
[2664.64 - 2668.72] they take somebody all the way to the
[2666.64 - 2671.76] finish line the chronically ill that's
[2668.72 - 2673.20] the whole point there's a question
[2671.76 - 2675.20] about kitchen tools so go to
[2673.20 - 2677.28] medicalmedium.com you'll see a directory
[2675.20 - 2678.80] kitchen kitchen directory okay and a

[3318.40 - 3322.40] why is your papaya green
[3320.48 - 3324.96] okay good question
[3322.40 - 3327.60] that papaya is ripe
[3324.96 - 3329.12] somebody else's green papaya might be
[3327.60 - 3330.64] hard as a rock
[3329.12 - 3332.40] and not ripe
[3330.64 - 3335.44] the kind of papayas i've been getting
[3332.40 - 3337.84] lately they ripen inside even when
[3335.44 - 3340.24] they're green with slight yellow on them
[3337.84 - 3342.32] but see you have to know about papayas
[3340.24 - 3344.32] because you can let it ripen more but
[3342.32 - 3346.32] these were ripe but that's just the kind
[3344.32 - 3349.12] of papaya it is so
[3346.32 - 3352.08] here's what i'll do
[3349.12 - 3354.56] let's put it in a bowl
[3352.08 - 3354.56] right here
[3354.88 - 3358.32] here's a fruit bowl you can make out of
[3356.40 - 3360.08] papaya do it with other things if you
[3358.32 - 3364.48] want to so what i'm doing is i'm getting
[3360.08 - 3364.48] these little squares in here like this
[3365.36 - 3370.40] right
[3366.88 - 3370.40] see i'm scooping these out you guys
[3371.36 - 3375.20] all right there you go
[3372.96 - 3378.00] and you can you can scoop this right
[3375.20 - 3379.12] down to the rind with a ripe papaya just
[3378.00 - 3381.04] so you know
[3379.12 - 3382.96] right down to the rind i mean look i
[3381.04 - 3384.24] could even do better than that but i'm
[3382.96 - 3386.08] kind of just trying to get a lot of
[3384.24 - 3387.68] things done we still got to talk a
[3386.08 - 3388.96] little bit about what the cleanse does
[3387.68 - 3390.88] for you
[3388.96 - 3392.72] and okay
[3390.88 - 3394.88] we got some nice papaya in that bowl
[3392.72 - 3396.80] right there scooping it right down to
[3394.88 - 3398.96] the rind and you can even do even better
[3396.80 - 3401.36] than what i just did that was kind of a
[3398.96 - 3403.28] quickie right there it wasn't really you

[3640.96 - 3644.16] first for medical media and prime
[3642.40 - 3645.44] example of how this information gets out

[3645.44 - 3648.32] and i'm glad it did
[3646.96 - 3650.00] but i'm
[3648.32 - 3651.60] unhappy if the doctor didn't tell you

[3677.68 - 3682.00] your skeletal system
[3679.44 - 3684.00] renato banana says the amount of times
[3682.00 - 3686.00] they drew blood from my mom within the
[3684.00 - 3688.96] six months she underwent cancer
[3686.00 - 3690.80] treatments was absolutely insane
[3688.96 - 3692.64] they do it
[3690.80 - 3694.56] not the doctor doesn't do it on purpose
[3692.64 - 3697.04] i think the system is rigged to do it
[3694.56 - 3699.52] purposely that's what i believe
[3697.04 - 3702.16] but that's my opinion
[3699.52 - 3703.60] you know everybody has their own opinion
[3702.16 - 3705.20] i'm pretty sure they're trying to kill
[3703.60 - 3707.12] people with the blood with the broken
[3705.20 - 3708.72] blood system that they have check out
[3707.12 - 3710.40] the podcast you can get half miles
[3708.72 - 3714.16] quarter vials just got to ask for it's
[3710.40 - 3714.16] happening now because medical medium
[3714.40 - 3718.48] people are losing their bones they're
[3716.16 - 3719.84] weakening they're thinning they need the
[3718.48 - 3721.92] morning cleanse
[3719.84 - 3724.16] important to know right there
[3721.92 - 3726.00] every single day we're so acidic we're
[3724.16 - 3728.56] pissing out a piece of ourselves we're
[3726.00 - 3732.00] pissing out our skull
[3728.56 - 3732.00] we're pissing out of our skull
[3732.16 - 3734.88] what that means is when you go to
[3733.44 - 3736.32] bathroom in the morning when you're
[3734.88 - 3738.40] urinating
[3736.32 - 3741.52] tiny tiny
[3738.40 - 3744.32] bits of your skull go out at the same
[3741.52 - 3747.04] time because we're so acidic our skull
[3744.32 - 3749.60] dissolves so when you're 65 and you get
[3747.04 - 3751.20] into a car accident you got a fractured
[3749.60 - 3753.60] skull when you wouldn't have had a
[3751.20 - 3756.56] fractured skull when you were 45 under
[3753.60 - 3758.56] the same car accident

[3817.36 - 3820.64] not mine how else would i come up with
[3819.28 - 3822.08] new material that no one's ever heard
[3820.64 - 3824.56] before on the planet over and over again
[3822.08 - 3826.64] for 35 years completely

[3826.64 - 3830.56] alternative health system as it is how's
