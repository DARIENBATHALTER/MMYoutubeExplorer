[36.24 - 43.16] better and moving forward because when

[53.36 - 59.44] we're dealing with something and it's in
[56.12 - 63.12] the way and it's hard it's hard because
[59.44 - 66.68] you the world is hard enough to live in
[63.12 - 69.48] it's hard enough to live in it really is
[66.68 - 71.48] and um for all walks of life for all
[69.48 - 73.28] walks of life for sure I mean for
[71.48 - 76.24] different reasons for some for different
[73.28 - 78.80] reasons for others but it's it it's a
[76.24 - 81.68] difficult place it's not a it's not such
[78.80 - 83.00] a easy easy place that's why we always
[81.68 - 85.52] that's why we always when we raise our
[83.00 - 88.88] children we protect them and we we look
[85.52 - 91.64] after them because we know we know the
[88.88 - 93.16] world is a scary plays and as our
[91.64 - 95.08] children grow up we're like we're
[93.16 - 97.24] nervous we're nervous we're nervous when
[95.08 - 100.16] they go off to college we're nervous
[97.24 - 102.68] when they enter High School we're
[100.16 - 105.40] nervous um you know when they meet
[102.68 - 106.56] people we're nervous and there's reasons
[105.40 - 110.56] why we're
[106.56 - 112.96] nervous because let's face it okay yeah
[110.56 - 115.44] the world is hard and we want every
[112.96 - 118.72] opportunity we can and best best and
[115.44 - 120.44] safest and and um and opportunity for
[118.72 - 123.44] our children just like just just like we
[120.44 - 126.32] would want for even ourselves as adults
[123.44 - 130.12] and and just because the world is always
[126.32 - 132.60] a difficult place in so many ways so
[130.12 - 135.72] when we're sick we don't feel good we
[132.60 - 137.36] have symptoms that we have symptoms that
[135.72 - 140.56] that even though they have names to them
[137.36 - 142.68] and some don't have names to them CU you
[140.56 - 144.60] know in in chronic illness it's just
[142.68 - 146.56] it's it's not cracked up to where it's
[144.60 - 149.32] supposed to be it's not it's not up to
[146.56 - 151.84] that point and um but if we have
[149.32 - 155.76] symptoms whether they're named or not it
[151.84 - 158.76] gets difficult and because most all
[155.76 - 162.36] symptoms most almost all symptoms are
[158.76 - 164.08] mystery they're mystery and that's why
[162.36 - 165.80] that's why we need hey look and who has
[164.08 - 168.28] 10 years or 20 years to wait for an
[165.80 - 171.00] answer on a symptom we got to do our
[168.28 - 172.96] best now and we have to do what we can
[171.00 - 174.68] now that's what the show is about
[172.96 - 176.32] because this is the only Health show
[174.68 - 179.36] where the information here it doesn't
[176.32 - 181.12] come from contaminated sources it
[179.36 - 182.84] doesn't come from sources like interest
[181.12 - 184.92] groups and medical funding with strings
[182.84 - 187.00] attached to it The Botch research I talk
[184.92 - 189.24] about all the time the lobbyists in the
[187.00 - 190.88] medical field the internal Kickbacks the
[189.24 - 192.76] thumb on the scale and all kinds of
[190.88 - 195.96] science and research so it pushes it one
[192.76 - 198.08] way for reasons to F because of funding
[195.96 - 200.40] persuaded belief systems that that get
[198.08 - 202.36] so saturated they take over and they
[200.40 - 204.36] don't let any new ideas come in to
[202.36 - 207.08] private panels of
[204.36 - 209.12] influencers that have to go a certain
[207.08 - 210.80] way and vote a certain way on the
[209.12 - 213.88] medical field both alternative and
[210.80 - 216.48] conventional because of money involved
[213.88 - 218.04] to health field payoffs to trendy traps
[216.48 - 220.08] can you believe that stuff's in the way
[218.04 - 223.84] of getting us better I mean it just
[220.08 - 225.28] blows my mind it blows my mind and
[223.84 - 228.72] you're not going to get any of that here
[225.28 - 230.64] the information here is pure it's clean
[228.72 - 233.92] it's untampered with it comes from a
[230.64 - 236.80] source I was born to here at age four I
[233.92 - 238.96] received a a a voice that was speaking
[236.80 - 241.56] to me perfectly clear I dedicate it my
[238.96 - 243.48] entire life because cuz I had no choice
[241.56 - 245.16] I dedicated my entire life with working
[243.48 - 248.72] with that voice and making sure the
[245.16 - 250.80] information and the and and what we need
[248.72 - 253.08] to heal and move forward is clean it's
[250.80 - 255.08] pure untampered with and doesn't have
[253.08 - 256.68] all that stuff I just mentioned and
[255.08 - 258.48] that's what the shows about so it's the
[256.68 - 260.92] only Health show that has that because
[258.48 - 263.68] even information that's swimming out
[260.92 - 265.96] there on the Internet or anywhere else
[263.68 - 267.64] could have contamination to it in one
[265.96 - 269.76] way or another even if there's jewels
[267.64 - 272.04] and gems to pick from it that are pretty
[269.76 - 274.64] good there's also some traps in there we
[272.04 - 276.20] don't want that we don't want that so
[274.64 - 279.32] that's what this is about
[276.20 - 282.28] today today we're talking about eating
[279.32 - 284.28] disorders and and this is a serious
[282.28 - 287.96] serious thing we're going to cover the
[284.28 - 289.84] serious eating disorder aspects that
[287.96 - 291.88] that we know about but we're going to
[289.84 - 295.28] cover also the other ones that aren't
[291.88 - 297.12] serious but they're annoying and and
[295.28 - 298.92] there's a lot of things involved with
[297.12 - 300.52] eating disorders there's a lot more than
[298.92 - 302.68] I think people
[300.52 - 303.80] no and you know and when it comes down
[302.68 - 306.36] to eating
[303.80 - 308.96] disorders okay there's a lot of messed
[306.36 - 310.60] up stuff going on I'm not talking about
[308.96 - 312.96] the people suffering with the eating
[310.60 - 315.40] disorder I'm talking about the way it's
[312.96 - 318.28] viewed and understood in medical science
[315.40 - 321.40] and research talking about contaminated
[318.28 - 323.68] sources of information talking about you
[321.40 - 325.40] know skewed funding and everything else
[323.68 - 327.16] and all that stuff I talked the know
[325.40 - 331.24] panels of influencers when it comes down
[327.16 - 333.64] to eating disorders it's in a way that's
[331.24 - 335.32] really not that helpful of course we
[333.64 - 338.04] have emergency medicine for people who
[335.32 - 340.08] have severe severe eating disorders and
[338.04 - 343.08] and and you know
[340.08 - 345.36] and emergency strategies that are
[343.08 - 348.04] involved that are out there that have
[345.36 - 350.44] saved lives and I'm not denouncing that
[348.04 - 352.80] but at the same time there's really not
[350.44 - 355.60] a lot of helpful stuff going on out
[352.80 - 358.04] there in the medical world for people
[355.60 - 360.88] with serious serious serious Eating
[358.04 - 363.36] Disorders it's just it's not there it's
[360.88 - 366.16] not there sure if they took a few
[363.36 - 368.40] billion dollars or2 billion and they put
[366.16 - 371.16] it just to eating disorders it would be
[368.40 - 373.76] amazing and they and they opened up the
[371.16 - 376.28] you know and they freed they freed
[373.76 - 379.96] everything so it wasn't just so just
[376.28 - 382.00] trapped with you know problems in the
[379.96 - 386.84] industry if they freed it to open to
[382.00 - 388.76] ideas and let really wonderful people in
[386.84 - 390.56] medicine say what they need to say and
[388.76 - 392.04] help people way they need to help we can
[390.56 - 394.52] move forward but it's like that with a
[392.04 - 396.88] lot of diseases and illnesses and things
[394.52 - 399.32] we struggle with but with eating
[396.88 - 402.44] disorders it's really it's really sad
[399.32 - 404.72] because it's it's really a place that's
[402.44 - 406.16] not tapped into it's a place that's not
[404.72 - 408.80] tapped into at
[406.16 - 410.84] all it's really and in fact they try to
[408.80 - 413.08] it's like black and white they try to
[410.84 - 415.20] black and white it where it's like okay
[413.08 - 417.32] it's mental you got a mental disease you

[553.04 - 559.00] works with medication for thyroid I talk
[555.04 - 562.48] about thyroid testing on how it's not as
[559.00 - 565.32] easy as everybody thinks even when the
[562.48 - 566.92] numbers seem to come out right or
[565.32 - 568.36] something seems to come up like Auto
[566.92 - 570.04] antibodies or something like that for
[568.36 - 572.08] Hashimoto
[570.04 - 573.80] when that happens I talk about that in
[572.08 - 575.32] detail I talk about the Undiscovered
[573.80 - 577.76] hormones that the thyroid has that
[575.32 - 579.52] nobody knows about nobody the

[584.48 - 590.36] to be exciting um so here we are let's
[588.76 - 593.24] get let's get into this let's figure
[590.36 - 594.96] this eating disorder thing out because
[593.24 - 598.32] all the years and the decades I've been
[594.96 - 601.20] doing this since the beginning okay I've
[598.32 - 603.36] seen it all I've seen it all with eating
[601.20 - 605.00] I've seen it all with eating and and and
[603.36 - 606.96] I'm just going to kind of I'm going to
[605.00 - 608.76] talk about a few things here now guess
[606.96 - 611.48] guess who has Eating
[608.76 - 614.44] Disorders the whole world the whole
[611.48 - 618.80] world has an eating disorder of some
[614.44 - 623.04] kind some way somehow some shape some
[618.80 - 625.64] size someone everyone has an eating
[623.04 - 627.60] disorder yeah do you believe me you're
[625.64 - 629.16] probably mad some of you he's saying I
[627.60 - 633.88] don't have an eating disorder I got it
[629.16 - 637.24] down pat I got it down I got it I got it
[633.88 - 639.36] straight they come the Eating Disorders
[637.24 - 641.08] range from being
[639.36 - 643.88] brainwashed
[641.08 - 646.84] brainwashed on how to eat originally
[643.88 - 648.08] from the 1920s 1930s from the 1930s
[646.84 - 652.24] actually
[648.08 - 655.48] 1933 1933 when the schulls were invaded
[652.24 - 658.04] with how you need to eat and that was
[655.48 - 660.12] taking away healthy diets from families
[658.04 - 662.56] that knew had that that had a lineage to
[660.12 - 664.68] knowing how to feed their children and
[662.56 - 667.32] feed their husbands and feed their
[664.68 - 669.56] family and feed feed their loved ones
[667.32 - 672.24] and that was Stripped Away by
[669.56 - 675.56] 1933 because this new doctrine came in
[672.24 - 678.36] this law came in about about how you
[675.56 - 680.84] should eat about how much protein you
[678.36 - 682.52] need and how many vegetables you don't
[680.84 - 684.52] need and how many fruits you don't need
[682.52 - 686.80] and it's all about protein and protein
[684.52 - 689.04] became cheap cuz the industry exploded
[686.80 - 691.24] right before World War II so animal
[689.04 - 693.40] protein became really really cheap and
[691.24 - 695.40] was became affordable purposely
[693.40 - 697.48] purposely at this time I'm not saying
[695.40 - 699.08] all this cuz I'm anti-animal protein if
[697.48 - 700.04] you like it fine I'm just telling you
[699.08 - 704.24] how it
[700.04 - 707.20] went and healthy diets that predate 1933
[704.24 - 710.32] where families raised their children
[707.20 - 714.24] on out of the gardens and so forth were
[710.32 - 718.12] starting to be like thrown on the back
[714.24 - 719.84] burner and in the school system it was
[718.12 - 722.76] inocent it was was right there in the
[719.84 - 725.24] school system the law became here is
[722.76 - 727.40] what here's what you need vegetables are
[725.24 - 729.00] down here that's that's the lowest
[727.40 - 731.80] amount you need that's the smallest
[729.00 - 734.36] amount of things you need and what's at
[731.80 - 736.24] the top of the the top here you you got
[734.36 - 738.12] to have lots and lots of protein that's
[736.24 - 740.84] at the very top and the protein has to
[738.12 - 742.76] be animals so it can't be nuts and seeds
[740.84 - 744.76] and it can't be leafy greens and it
[742.76 - 747.52] can't be those things at all it has to
[744.76 - 751.20] be the animal products this is when the
[747.52 - 753.76] animal world made made a deal with the
[751.20 - 756.48] government with the school systems and
[753.76 - 758.48] they all kind of got together and a deal
[756.48 - 761.92] was made in
[758.48 - 763.72] 1933 that alone created Eating Disorders
[761.92 - 766.16] eating disorders that you think are
[763.72 - 768.88] healthy but we're following the rules of
[766.16 - 770.36] the government on how to eat in 1933
[768.88 - 772.16] which still sticks to us from our
[770.36 - 775.32] grandparents to our parents and so forth
[772.16 - 777.32] to us and in some way we still have a
[775.32 - 780.24] fabric of a little bit of the the eating
[777.32 - 782.00] disorder that was given to us that was
[780.24 - 784.40] manufactured and given to us how do you
[782.00 - 786.80] like them apples huh how do you like
[784.40 - 788.24] them apples but that's just one one
[786.80 - 790.08] little piece of eating disorder
[788.24 - 791.84] information that you'll never hear
[790.08 - 793.80] anywhere else but here that's just one
[791.84 - 796.32] little little
[793.80 - 797.76] piece there's there's other pieces the
[796.32 - 800.08] whole world has an eating disorder I'm
[797.76 - 802.32] going to tell you that right now there's
[800.08 - 804.60] no question because in all kinds of
[802.32 - 806.24] different places the world there's
[804.60 - 807.44] there's places where people are starving
[806.24 - 809.04] they get Eating Disorders because
[807.44 - 811.08] they're starving because you're
[809.04 - 813.96] rationing the whole bit just instant
[811.08 - 817.28] Eating Disorders there's there's places
[813.96 - 820.72] where there's abundance of food but the
[817.28 - 822.28] way our bodies are viewed and the Eating
[820.72 - 823.56] Disorders can occur right there there's
[822.28 - 825.24] Eating Disorders everywhere there's
[823.56 - 828.84] eating disorders in all the colleges
[825.24 - 831.04] every single college campus from A to Z
[828.84 - 833.04] from here to there the kids are all
[831.04 - 834.24] having eating eating disorders I'm not
[833.04 - 835.52] talking about bulimia which we're going
[834.24 - 837.16] to talk about and I'm not talking about
[835.52 - 839.56] anorexia which we're going to talk about
[837.16 - 841.48] which is in the college campuses too
[839.56 - 844.28] that's not what I'm talking about I'm
[841.48 - 847.56] talking about drinking coffee till
[844.28 - 849.00] 2:00 drinking coffee just till till 2:00
[847.56 - 852.56] no breakfast it's drink coffee all the
[849.00 - 856.16] way to 2:00 that's what you do 2: 3 in
[852.56 - 859.56] the afternoon and then alcohol at
[856.16 - 861.84] night you know and then of course some
[859.56 - 863.28] food but unhealthy food and then alcohol
[861.84 - 866.60] at night that's that's an eating
[863.28 - 868.08] disorder meanwhile that that group those
[866.60 - 869.92] group of people that still do that even
[868.08 - 872.52] not in college what we do here now that
[869.92 - 873.96] we do that at work think that the only
[872.52 - 875.48] eating disorder people out there is
[873.96 - 876.48] people with bulim and anorexia and
[875.48 - 879.16] that's the only thing and that's the
[876.48 - 883.96] eating disorder no wait a minute that's
[879.16 - 887.12] no no no no no no no no no nope nope
[883.96 - 890.00] nope it's not how it works Eating
[887.12 - 892.76] Disorders are rampant rampant rampant
[890.00 - 894.56] adults that have to drink every night
[892.76 - 896.88] and have a glass of wine that's an
[894.56 - 899.24] eating disorder it's not just about
[896.88 - 901.16] alcoholism or anything like that it's
[899.24 - 902.16] not about that it's not even about that
[901.16 - 905.48] so
[902.16 - 907.80] much alcoholism of eating
[905.48 - 910.88] disorder it's an eating
[907.80 - 913.92] disorder that's right have I said that's
[910.88 - 916.28] right enough lately I don't think so
[913.92 - 918.40] that's right that you know it just
[916.28 - 922.68] alcohol alone isn't you know that having
[918.40 - 924.60] to be in the diet on a regular basis in
[922.68 - 927.16] someone's life on a regular
[924.60 - 930.08] basis isn't there's any heating disorder
[927.16 - 931.52] there would you believe it and then
[930.08 - 933.72] there's emotional Eating Disorders on
[931.52 - 935.92] all kinds of level there's OCD Eating
[933.72 - 938.84] Disorders yes everything's got to be
[935.92 - 940.60] perfect in regiment it down to the bone
[938.84 - 942.16] without a health problem I mean without
[940.60 - 944.84] no health problems that are there that
[942.16 - 945.92] are present what I'm trying to say is
[944.84 - 947.44] that there's people that are dealing
[945.92 - 949.04] with health problems and health issues
[947.44 - 950.36] they have to eat regimented because they
[949.04 - 951.76] got to keep their adrenal strong they
[950.36 - 953.44] got to keep their electrolytes going
[951.76 - 955.20] they have to keep the nerves transmitter
[953.44 - 958.28] because they got underlying conditions
[955.20 - 960.28] did I say that fast enough dear dear
[958.28 - 964.40] Lord
[960.28 - 967.04] um you know basically what this means is
[964.40 - 969.16] that people with health conditions yeah
[967.04 - 970.92] they have to eat every two hours I talk
[969.16 - 972.28] about that all the time Spirit has
[970.92 - 973.60] taught me that every hour and a half
[972.28 - 975.28] depending on what kind of adrenal
[973.60 - 977.76] problem somebody has depending on a
[975.28 - 980.16] liver problem all these different
[977.76 - 982.12] things and that that's even difficult
[980.16 - 983.96] enough and that can create different
[982.12 - 986.84] kinds of eating disorders for different
[983.96 - 989.52] reasons but we do the best we can but
[986.84 - 994.12] what really creates eating disord
[989.52 - 997.36] orders really creates them is this
[994.12 - 1000.12] notion this notion that we need three
[997.36 - 1002.36] meals a day and three meals a day only
[1000.12 - 1004.00] that creates them because then if
[1002.36 - 1005.24] someone has a health problem and they
[1004.00 - 1006.68] have to eat every hour and a half and
[1005.24 - 1008.96] they have to munch on celery sticks and
[1006.68 - 1010.64] a handful of nuts and some apple slices
[1008.96 - 1011.92] someone's going to call them call them
[1010.64 - 1013.12] out and say hey you got an eaing
[1011.92 - 1014.56] disorder if you have to eat every hour
[1013.12 - 1017.04] and a half and you have to eat an apple
[1014.56 - 1018.88] and and and celery sure we could say
[1017.04 - 1020.60] that but really what that's doing is
[1018.88 - 1021.96] saving somebody's adrenals and saving
[1020.60 - 1023.64] their health and rebuilding them and
[1021.96 - 1026.44] recovering them but someone who
[1023.64 - 1028.12] regimentally regimented has to eat three
[1026.44 - 1031.12] meals a day and believes anybody else
[1028.12 - 1033.20] who eats different has a has a problem
[1031.12 - 1034.96] that's an eating disorder that's one
[1033.20 - 1038.12] right
[1034.96 - 1041.20] there that right there that becomes an
[1038.12 - 1043.84] OCD variety of eating
[1041.20 - 1047.56] disorder also you know so here's the
[1043.84 - 1049.00] thing that's how confusing it all is see
[1047.56 - 1051.04] what I'm trying to say is if someone's
[1049.00 - 1053.28] actually doing a protocol that's
[1051.04 - 1055.48] regimented the proper kind of protocol
[1053.28 - 1058.56] that's there to rebuild their health and
[1055.48 - 1060.88] heal it's needed and you have to do it
[1058.56 - 1062.92] even if that's someone when they don't
[1060.88 - 1064.36] need that anymore it's hard to break and
[1062.92 - 1066.16] that's what I meant by it being possibly
[1064.36 - 1068.60] an eating disorder maybe 2 years is what
[1066.16 - 1070.24] you needed to rebuild your adrenals 2
[1068.60 - 1072.20] and A2 years is what you needed to build
[1070.24 - 1074.16] your rebuild your adrenals but now you
[1072.20 - 1076.92] know you're afraid to leave that one
[1074.16 - 1080.16] hour to an hour and a half of of of of
[1076.92 - 1082.28] grazing and you're afraid to to go 2 and
[1080.16 - 1083.76] 1/2 hours that day or 3 hours and you
[1082.28 - 1085.36] get nervous and that's when it can
[1083.76 - 1087.12] become like that but that but that was
[1085.36 - 1089.44] to rebuild your adrenals that was to
[1087.12 - 1091.44] rebuild you that was to heal you and
[1089.44 - 1094.96] that's no problem because you can get
[1091.44 - 1097.00] past that but it's hard to get past it's
[1094.96 - 1099.16] hard to get past so many other traps
[1097.00 - 1101.44] that are out the real traps traps in the
[1099.16 - 1103.88] industry like I just said that date back
[1101.44 - 1106.28] all the way to
[1103.88 - 1110.32] 1933 and those are
[1106.28 - 1110.32] serious and those are really serious
[1110.40 - 1114.32] and then you got of course you got the
[1112.12 - 1115.84] when it comes down to emotional eading
[1114.32 - 1117.64] emotional eading that means you know you
[1115.84 - 1119.16] got stress it's one way of coping with
[1117.64 - 1121.00] stress but I'm going to talk about that
[1119.16 - 1123.28] let's talk about that now why does
[1121.00 - 1125.44] somebody emotionally eat they
[1123.28 - 1127.00] emotionally eat and I'm going to tell
[1125.44 - 1130.12] you right now what it
[1127.00 - 1131.84] is not because they're missing something
[1130.12 - 1134.60] necessarily meaning they're missing
[1131.84 - 1136.52] something in their life whether it's
[1134.60 - 1140.40] love life or anything
[1136.52 - 1143.28] else that's not really totally the
[1140.40 - 1144.80] answer they're emotionally eating
[1143.28 - 1146.84] because they're trying to get enough
[1144.80 - 1149.48] glucose to the brain it's so critical
[1146.84 - 1152.16] and to the liver they're getting to try
[1149.48 - 1154.32] to get to to uh compensate for any kind
[1152.16 - 1156.44] of stress that they're under some people
[1154.32 - 1158.20] have they have glycogen storages that
[1156.44 - 1160.04] are really down low in the brain because
[1158.20 - 1161.56] the brain is made out of glycogen which
[1160.04 - 1165.12] is a
[1161.56 - 1166.88] carbohydrate and I swear to God if some
[1165.12 - 1169.96] says the brain is made out of fat one
[1166.88 - 1172.56] more time I'm meaning in the health
[1169.96 - 1175.20] field a professional and expert says the
[1172.56 - 1177.24] brain is made out of fat one more time I
[1175.20 - 1180.00] I don't know what to say anymore because
[1177.24 - 1184.60] I'm going to tell you right now it's not
[1180.00 - 1189.36] made out of fat there are traces traces
[1184.60 - 1191.48] of squalling traces of of of Omega-3s
[1189.36 - 1193.28] traces in the
[1191.48 - 1196.68] brain I
[1193.28 - 1199.68] repeat traces do you know what traces
[1196.68 - 1205.04] means traces mean
[1199.68 - 1208.68] minuscule very small amounts tiny levels
[1205.04 - 1213.20] of fat in the brain the brain is
[1208.68 - 1216.12] made out of cells and glycogen
[1213.20 - 1219.00] carbohydrate stored that's why the brain
[1216.12 - 1221.64] atrophies when you don't use
[1219.00 - 1224.80] it it
[1221.64 - 1228.24] atrophies it's made out of carbohydrate
[1224.80 - 1232.00] the brain thrives on sugar and it stores
[1228.24 - 1235.64] an abundance of glycogen because what
[1232.00 - 1239.04] runs the brain is that glycogen is that
[1235.64 - 1241.68] carbohydrate that's how literally how
[1239.04 - 1245.20] how messages get through the
[1241.68 - 1247.48] brain that's how it gets through the
[1245.20 - 1251.44] brain it's really important to
[1247.48 - 1253.40] understand this it is because people
[1251.44 - 1254.72] lose all their glycogen in the brain
[1253.40 - 1256.40] when they're under stress they start
[1254.72 - 1258.68] losing their glycogen they start losing
[1256.40 - 1261.20] their glucose and they start needing
[1258.68 - 1263.00] bagels and they need donuts and the
[1261.20 - 1264.52] emotional eat they're under stress
[1263.00 - 1267.72] they're under stress for one minute and
[1264.52 - 1269.80] they're gobbling down anything they're
[1267.72 - 1272.76] gobbling down something Pizza they're
[1269.80 - 1274.56] gobbling down anything they can find
[1272.76 - 1276.24] chocolate whatever they can find and
[1274.56 - 1278.48] they a lot of times people gobble down
[1276.24 - 1279.64] all the wrong stuff when they're under
[1278.48 - 1281.96] that kind of stress which makes you
[1279.64 - 1284.40] gobble down more because it can it it
[1281.96 - 1287.04] can get in the way of sugar and glycogen
[1284.40 - 1290.24] getting to the brain it could get in the
[1287.04 - 1292.76] way of that getting to the brain and
[1290.24 - 1294.72] then if you have a body image if someone
[1292.76 - 1296.40] is a body image and they think they got
[1294.72 - 1297.84] to be really skinny and they think
[1296.40 - 1300.36] they're
[1297.84 - 1302.64] overweight and and and they're starving
[1300.36 - 1304.88] themselves of carbohydrate and then it
[1302.64 - 1308.00] making them binge later that that's
[1304.88 - 1310.28] that's a whole recipe for a
[1308.00 - 1312.76] disaster but on the emotional end of
[1310.28 - 1314.28] eating the emotional scale of eating I
[1312.76 - 1316.72] mean it ranges from all kinds of
[1314.28 - 1318.84] different levels
[1316.72 - 1320.20] everywhere I mean you go under stress
[1318.84 - 1322.64] you need to eat
[1320.20 - 1324.28] something and I'm not talking about when
[1322.64 - 1326.00] boom you just got the news you just got
[1324.28 - 1328.44] a divorce meaning your partner just you
[1326.00 - 1330.36] know threw divorce on you walk through
[1328.44 - 1331.92] the door and said you know we're done or
[1330.36 - 1333.44] your soulmate or whatever I'm not
[1331.92 - 1335.48] talking about that that might not you
[1333.44 - 1338.44] might not eat it all when that happens
[1335.48 - 1341.04] for for a month you might starve
[1338.44 - 1343.64] yourself I've seen that happen all the
[1341.04 - 1345.88] time where you don't eat
[1343.64 - 1348.28] anything because you're too sick you're
[1345.88 - 1349.80] too sick from the trauma to even eat
[1348.28 - 1351.16] anything but then later on after that
[1349.80 - 1353.04] once you start recovering from that
[1351.16 - 1355.08] trauma you might start eating eating
[1353.04 - 1357.32] eating eating because your brain is like
[1355.08 - 1359.24] oh my God I lost all that glycogen from
[1357.32 - 1361.00] the trauma I need as much sugar as
[1359.24 - 1362.52] possible or say you're in the workplace
[1361.00 - 1364.80] and you're up against you you got some
[1362.52 - 1366.80] really difficult
[1364.80 - 1368.16] people you got some really difficult
[1366.80 - 1369.84] people at the workplace they're driving
[1368.16 - 1372.28] you nuts and you're just like oh my God
[1369.84 - 1374.76] and you're just eating yourself eating
[1372.28 - 1377.72] yourself sick and I don't blame you one
[1374.76 - 1380.64] bit 100% I've been under a lot of stress
[1377.72 - 1382.00] over over the years my God now hearing
[1380.64 - 1383.48] spirit and helping people out in the way
[1382.00 - 1385.12] I've had to help out people and all the
[1383.48 - 1386.88] offices that I've had over the years and
[1385.12 - 1390.16] helping people out and as much as I did
[1386.88 - 1392.04] this since I was a kid you name it you
[1390.16 - 1393.92] know I would just be like all right you
[1392.04 - 1396.64] know what I'm going to eat that right
[1393.92 - 1396.64] now I'm going to eat
[1399.04 - 1403.56] it my brain needs that fuel I'm going to
[1401.72 - 1405.44] eat it oh it's not a good choice though
[1403.56 - 1409.40] I get it I I know I didn't pick a good
[1405.44 - 1412.40] choice I C came to uh to a bad choice of
[1409.40 - 1415.72] food a circum to was bad choice of food
[1412.40 - 1417.92] look look the deal is that everybody's
[1415.72 - 1420.20] got a eating disorder I have to be
[1417.92 - 1421.84] honest I have to be straight if you
[1420.20 - 1423.68] think you got it all sewed up and you
[1421.84 - 1425.20] think you got it all down you think you
[1423.68 - 1428.32] got it down
[1425.20 - 1430.64] perfect uh it's possible you don't and
[1428.32 - 1433.40] that's okay there's nothing wrong with
[1430.64 - 1436.00] that I think we're too hard on people
[1433.40 - 1439.36] that are bulimic and anorexic we're too
[1436.00 - 1441.16] hard on people way too hard hard we make
[1439.36 - 1444.52] it like the whole world has it sewed up
[1441.16 - 1447.16] except for them I mean come on that
[1444.52 - 1449.36] that's ridiculous and also terrible
[1447.16 - 1450.24] terrible because that's what happens
[1449.36 - 1453.20] that's what
[1450.24 - 1456.64] happens because you know women and men
[1453.20 - 1457.76] mostly women okay that have the anorexia
[1456.64 - 1461.12] that have the
[1457.76 - 1464.52] bulimia all right they feel like it's
[1461.12 - 1466.40] just them just them only and I feel like
[1464.52 - 1468.44] everybody's eating perfectly whatever
[1466.40 - 1470.48] that may be
[1468.44 - 1474.00] and that they're they're screwing up
[1470.48 - 1476.08] it's disastrous it's not true it's not
[1474.00 - 1477.64] true there's so many different eating
[1476.08 - 1479.60] disorders in so many different levels
[1477.64 - 1481.48] and ways I can't even cover it in a show
[1479.60 - 1483.24] there's no way it's not even possible
[1481.48 - 1485.24] I'm going to try to cover what I can
[1483.24 - 1487.04] just the OCD variety of eating is
[1485.24 - 1489.08] unbelievable what people want what they
[1487.04 - 1490.52] do of what they like of what they're
[1489.08 - 1492.56] what they pet or what they like or what
[1490.52 - 1496.60] they're afraid
[1492.56 - 1498.28] of afraid of trying something new having
[1496.60 - 1501.28] that tuna fish sandwich every single
[1498.28 - 1502.92] lunch every single lunch for 30 years
[1501.28 - 1506.40] that's an eating
[1502.92 - 1509.56] disorder 40 years having that tuna for
[1506.40 - 1512.16] lunch every single day every other day
[1509.56 - 1513.52] for lunch and then grill cheese on you
[1512.16 - 1515.36] know maybe a couple days a week and
[1513.52 - 1517.20] that's it and that's their lunch and
[1515.36 - 1519.64] it's regimented and has to be that that
[1517.20 - 1522.44] way for 40 years that's an eating
[1519.64 - 1525.64] disorder I'm tell you right
[1522.44 - 1527.56] now you see what I'm you see where I I'm
[1525.64 - 1528.68] I am here with this it's really
[1527.56 - 1531.44] difficult
[1528.68 - 1532.80] C so it's just to what what degree
[1531.44 - 1535.80] somebody has an eating disorder and
[1532.80 - 1538.12] what's the underlying cause of one with
[1535.80 - 1541.24] bulimia and
[1538.12 - 1544.76] anorexia 90% of the
[1541.24 - 1548.88] cause is heavy metal toxicity to the
[1544.76 - 1551.32] brain mostly Mercury mostly Mercury
[1548.88 - 1554.32] inside the brain that came from some
[1551.32 - 1557.52] Source from childhood or from pre Source
[1554.32 - 1561.08] in the womb or from pre Source before
[1557.52 - 1563.24] the that from the parents or like I said
[1561.08 - 1566.68] from childhood Mercury entered the body
[1563.24 - 1570.00] somehow some way into a child into a
[1566.68 - 1576.20] baby that is the future of a possible
[1570.00 - 1580.56] anorexia or bulimia that's 90% 90% easy
[1576.20 - 1582.04] 90% or more the other 10% or less
[1580.56 - 1584.60] depending on where we are in the world
[1582.04 - 1588.92] or what where we are but the other 10%
[1584.60 - 1590.20] or less is some kind of emotional trauma
[1588.92 - 1592.24] some kind of emotional trauma that
[1590.20 - 1595.48] happened to the brain that caused
[1592.24 - 1598.48] emotional scarring in the brain itself
[1595.48 - 1603.04] on a physical level not just on a soul
[1598.48 - 1605.32] level on a physical level on a physical
[1603.04 - 1608.80] level something
[1605.32 - 1611.16] happened but that's much less much less
[1608.80 - 1613.72] much less on the scale for anorexia and
[1611.16 - 1614.96] bulimia than heavy metal poisoning and
[1613.72 - 1617.08] here's the problem with the heavy metal
[1614.96 - 1619.04] poisoning Professionals in the field of
[1617.08 - 1622.84] you know the whole bulimia field of
[1619.04 - 1625.72] bulimia field of of anorexia those
[1622.84 - 1627.64] professionals don't know about the
[1625.72 - 1631.28] Mercury have no clue that the Mercury's
[1627.64 - 1633.28] causing this on any level or started it
[1631.28 - 1635.60] they don't have a clue about that that's
[1633.28 - 1637.56] a problem they just think it's all just
[1635.60 - 1639.16] emotional all just scarring all just
[1637.56 - 1640.48] emotional and they do the best they can
[1639.16 - 1642.20] and they help people out the best they
[1640.48 - 1645.04] can I completely understand that and
[1642.20 - 1648.24] completely respect that on every
[1645.04 - 1649.88] level but
[1648.24 - 1652.08] but it's it's the Mercury it's the
[1649.88 - 1655.04] Mercury toxicity it's the mercury
[1652.08 - 1655.68] poisoning and that's what it is that's a
[1655.04 - 1656.96] big
[1655.68 - 1660.48] [Music]
[1656.96 - 1660.48] deal that's a big
[1660.76 - 1668.00] deal so when it comes down
[1664.36 - 1670.48] to when it comes down to Healing bulimia
[1668.00 - 1672.28] healing anorexia one thing we have to
[1670.48 - 1674.92] understand is that there's an adrenaline
[1672.28 - 1677.96] Factor I've talked about this before for
[1674.92 - 1679.56] instance with bulimia when you vomit it
[1677.96 - 1681.16] it forces the adrenals to flood the
[1679.56 - 1684.12] whole body with
[1681.16 - 1686.80] adrenaline this becomes a
[1684.12 - 1689.44] distraction if it's if okay say it's say
[1686.80 - 1691.20] you have bulimia because 10% the 10% of
[1689.44 - 1695.68] the people have bulimia it's because of
[1691.20 - 1698.72] an emotional trauma well by
[1695.68 - 1699.44] vomiting the adrenals flood the body
[1698.72 - 1701.96] with
[1699.44 - 1704.36] adrenaline it becomes
[1701.96 - 1708.08] euphoric all that adrenaline hits the
[1704.36 - 1711.16] brain and it actually is like heroin
[1708.08 - 1713.24] it's it's it's like heroin it's like a
[1711.16 - 1714.96] drug and it gets into the brain it
[1713.24 - 1717.68] saturates the brain it
[1714.96 - 1720.92] completely takes over the
[1717.68 - 1722.52] brain and that becomes extremely
[1720.92 - 1725.28] addictive so addictive that you get
[1722.52 - 1729.96] addicted to the adrenaline Factor you're
[1725.28 - 1732.76] getting addicted to the adrenaline
[1729.96 - 1734.72] surge when it comes down to pimia
[1732.76 - 1738.12] there's an adrenaline
[1734.72 - 1740.40] surge so it actually it the adrenaline
[1738.12 - 1742.52] starts to then you get trained where
[1740.40 - 1744.88] before you vomit if you even think about
[1742.52 - 1746.76] vomiting your adrenals start to rev up
[1744.88 - 1749.32] and they start releasing tons and tons
[1746.76 - 1751.72] of epinephrine like we're talking loads
[1749.32 - 1755.40] of epinephrine saturate the body run up
[1751.72 - 1757.76] to the brain and it actually makes you
[1755.40 - 1759.88] vomit and then you're in the Trap it
[1757.76 - 1762.44] becomes a severe addiction severe
[1759.88 - 1765.20] addiction to Adrenaline and that's what
[1762.44 - 1767.88] the real thing is happening now say
[1765.20 - 1769.64] you're somebody with bulimia and you got
[1767.88 - 1771.20] the mercury poisoning which is the 90
[1769.64 - 1773.44] 90% or
[1771.20 - 1774.28] more and you got the mercury poisoning
[1773.44 - 1777.36] in the
[1774.28 - 1779.44] brain and it's that variety of that that
[1777.36 - 1781.12] variety of bulimia the same thing
[1779.44 - 1784.24] happens when you vomit the adrenaline
[1781.12 - 1787.80] goes to the brain and it eases it eases
[1784.24 - 1791.72] it helps electrical impulses bypass the
[1787.80 - 1793.36] Mercury which actually feel like a cure
[1791.72 - 1795.16] for the illness for that moment so
[1793.36 - 1796.88] vomiting becomes this instinctive
[1795.16 - 1801.08] wanting to cure the problem through
[1796.88 - 1803.20] using epinephrine for using
[1801.08 - 1804.80] adrenaline and it become severely
[1803.20 - 1806.16] addictive and we're in the binging and
[1804.80 - 1808.52] throwing up binging and throwing up
[1806.16 - 1810.28] binging and throwing up and then body
[1808.52 - 1812.92] image can fit into any of that because
[1810.28 - 1816.44] body image is into every here's the
[1812.92 - 1819.08] problem too it's body image will will
[1816.44 - 1820.56] fall into any kind of anorexia or any
[1819.08 - 1823.20] kind of
[1820.56 - 1825.88] bulimia that say heavy metal caused or
[1823.20 - 1827.80] trauma caused the reason why it fits in
[1825.88 - 1830.20] because it fits in with everything every
[1827.80 - 1832.92] single person right now on planet Earth
[1830.20 - 1835.08] especially women they all have to deal
[1832.92 - 1837.04] with body image it just so happens that
[1835.08 - 1838.64] if you got the mercury poisoning too and
[1837.04 - 1841.08] the addiction to the adrenaline from
[1838.64 - 1843.80] vomiting and you got the normal body
[1841.08 - 1846.08] image worry that every girl has growing
[1843.80 - 1849.32] up on planet Earth right now because the
[1846.08 - 1852.08] world makes it happen like that when
[1849.32 - 1854.72] that happens and it's added into that
[1852.08 - 1856.44] then that's what takes the blame only
[1854.72 - 1858.00] body image takes the blame because
[1856.44 - 1860.00] professionals don't know there's mercury
[1858.00 - 1862.00] poisoning involved professionals don't
[1860.00 - 1864.24] know there's a serious addiction to the
[1862.00 - 1867.16] adrenaline like no other like a serious
[1864.24 - 1869.40] drug so they Point only to body image or
[1867.16 - 1873.12] some kind of mental
[1869.40 - 1876.24] illness and this is this is why it's so
[1873.12 - 1878.12] hard so someone with bulimia if they
[1876.24 - 1879.52] know they're addicted to Adrenaline and
[1878.12 - 1881.44] they have to fight that addiction to the
[1879.52 - 1886.16] adrenaline and if they could just bypass
[1881.44 - 1888.44] that they can be free they could be
[1886.16 - 1891.76] free and that's a big deal that's a
[1888.44 - 1894.88] really big deal and also another thing
[1891.76 - 1896.64] too is is a carbohydrates critical for
[1894.88 - 1898.16] healing anorexia or bulimia and I'm
[1896.64 - 1900.56] going talk about more about anorexia but
[1898.16 - 1902.64] for bulimia a carbohydrate is critical
[1900.56 - 1905.72] for healing it because if you starve
[1902.64 - 1907.68] carbohydrates someone with bulimia it
[1905.72 - 1909.32] only makes it worse they'll end up
[1907.68 - 1911.36] binging on carbohydrates just like a
[1909.32 - 1913.16] person without bulimia does you put
[1911.36 - 1914.88] somebody on a no carb diet they're going
[1913.16 - 1916.28] to go on binges or they're going to have
[1914.88 - 1917.76] alcohol at night they're going to do
[1916.28 - 1918.92] something they're going to do something
[1917.76 - 1920.24] they're going to break their diet
[1918.92 - 1922.80] someday and when they do it's going to
[1920.24 - 1924.20] be crazy binging what they think is
[1922.80 - 1925.96] crazy binging it's going to be eating
[1924.20 - 1927.68] four slices of pizza and then back on
[1925.96 - 1930.16] their no carb diet for three weeks and
[1927.68 - 1932.64] then boom binging again with five Bagels
[1930.16 - 1934.36] then boom back to the no carb diet it's
[1932.64 - 1935.40] just though they don't have bulimia they
[1934.36 - 1938.96] don't have the addiction to the
[1935.40 - 1941.16] adrenaline and they're vomiting all the
[1938.96 - 1942.44] time so but if you take somebody with
[1941.16 - 1944.40] Bimi and you starve them with
[1942.44 - 1946.80] carbohydrates God
[1944.40 - 1949.52] forbid then you better believe they're
[1946.80 - 1951.76] going to they're gonna go on a
[1949.52 - 1952.72] binge they're going to go on a binge and
[1951.76 - 1955.28] they're going to vomit and they're going
[1952.72 - 1956.52] to get the adrenaline high so they need
[1955.28 - 1958.16] a healthy carbohydrate but if you give
[1956.52 - 1959.52] them a bad carbohydrate mentally they're
[1958.16 - 1960.84] going to be like whoa I got to throw
[1959.52 - 1962.48] this up now I'm filled with bad
[1960.84 - 1965.00] carbohydrates I'm filled with bagels and
[1962.48 - 1967.32] donuts that's why fruit is so critical
[1965.00 - 1969.92] for someone with bulimia I've helped
[1967.32 - 1972.56] recover people with bulimia over the
[1969.92 - 1974.16] decades with just fruit because they
[1972.56 - 1975.80] could eat all the fruit they want they
[1974.16 - 1977.56] knew it was a healthy carbohydrate and
[1975.80 - 1979.16] here's a problem right now
[1977.56 - 1981.00] in the industry right now there's a
[1979.16 - 1983.36] contamination that got into the
[1981.00 - 1986.08] alternative world of healing and now
[1983.36 - 1987.56] it's Inc conventional too started in the
[1986.08 - 1991.72] alternative world of
[1987.56 - 1992.76] healing and and it's the no fruit anti
[1991.72 - 1996.32] fruit
[1992.76 - 1998.88] movement don't ever let that
[1996.32 - 2002.24] contaminated um belief system get in
[1998.88 - 2004.48] your way they used it they they're using
[2002.24 - 2005.84] it against you you don't even know using
[2004.48 - 2007.56] it against you I remember the first
[2005.84 - 2010.00] person who who brought
[2007.56 - 2011.60] this into the system I know why they did
[2010.00 - 2013.00] I know who it is I'm not going to
[2011.60 - 2015.52] mention names but I know why they
[2013.00 - 2017.04] brought it in they brought it in so that
[2015.52 - 2019.48] you wouldn't eat fruit but you would buy
[2017.04 - 2022.76] their supplements that had fruit in
[2019.48 - 2024.60] it and that's how it started just it was
[2022.76 - 2026.84] it was unbelievable it was the perfect
[2024.60 - 2028.96] timing for this contamination to bust on
[2026.84 - 2030.20] the scene because at the same time there
[2028.96 - 2032.76] were all these people trying to get away
[2030.20 - 2034.88] from Bad sugars so it was perfect it fit
[2032.76 - 2037.52] right in and it took over now fruit was
[2034.88 - 2040.12] thrown into the whole basket it's been
[2037.52 - 2041.60] disastrous and that's what I mean when I
[2040.12 - 2043.84] talk about at the beginning of the show
[2041.60 - 2046.28] that very thing I talk about about this
[2043.84 - 2047.88] information is not contaminated it's so
[2046.28 - 2049.92] critical to know this and when you're
[2047.88 - 2052.92] dealing with bulimia fruit is the way to
[2049.92 - 2055.32] go because if if if someone with bulimia
[2052.92 - 2058.04] knows they have the adrenaline
[2055.32 - 2059.80] addiction if someone with bulim knows
[2058.04 - 2062.96] that fruit is a healthy carbohydrate
[2059.80 - 2065.88] that they need and it won't cause a body
[2062.96 - 2068.72] image problem if that's even factored in
[2065.88 - 2071.72] eventually if that becomes the
[2068.72 - 2073.40] escapegoat then fruit is the answer
[2071.72 - 2076.48] because the carbohydrate can get to the
[2073.40 - 2078.80] brain it can help heal the brain cuz the
[2076.48 - 2081.44] brain's not made out of fat it's made
[2078.80 - 2083.52] out of glycogen this was figured out by
[2081.44 - 2086.24] science actually long ago I mean they
[2083.52 - 2088.40] figured this one out but it didn't fit
[2086.24 - 2091.00] it didn't fit the
[2088.40 - 2093.00] industries it didn't fit the
[2091.00 - 2095.36] industries that's a whole another story
[2093.00 - 2096.72] of why this is happening where why the
[2095.36 - 2098.76] the brain is they're they're avoiding
[2096.72 - 2100.92] the the fact that the brain is the the
[2098.76 - 2103.88] experts right now are avoiding the
[2100.92 - 2105.04] fact that that the brain is is is filled
[2103.88 - 2106.64] with
[2105.04 - 2108.52] carbohydrate and we're going to do a
[2106.64 - 2111.00] whole show on that
[2108.52 - 2114.88] someday that's on the list that's on
[2111.00 - 2116.40] that big list so somebody with bulimia
[2114.88 - 2117.40] has to have fruit in their diet they
[2116.40 - 2120.32] have to they have to get the
[2117.40 - 2122.00] carbohydrates to help the adrenals they
[2120.32 - 2123.80] got to keep the blood sugar balance
[2122.00 - 2125.44] because once blood sugar drops that can
[2123.80 - 2127.04] create bulim all on its own when you
[2125.44 - 2130.84] have it already when you're addicted to
[2127.04 - 2132.36] the adrenaline issue it's critical it's
[2130.84 - 2134.28] got to go to the brain it's got to help
[2132.36 - 2135.96] the brain heal and then you got to do
[2134.28 - 2138.28] the heavy metal detox you got to do the
[2135.96 - 2139.56] detox smoothie you got to do the right
[2138.28 - 2141.36] kind you got to get a little bit of the
[2139.56 - 2143.40] swine spiruline in there a little bit of
[2141.36 - 2145.36] the vimergy barley grass juice in there
[2143.40 - 2147.00] you got to get a little bit of the um
[2145.36 - 2148.20] you got to get some wild blueberries in
[2147.00 - 2150.28] there you got to get a little bit of
[2148.20 - 2151.92] dolls in there you got to get a little
[2150.28 - 2153.32] bit of cantro in there every single day
[2151.92 - 2154.76] and you got to start taking the Mercury
[2153.32 - 2156.36] down and you start taking that mercury
[2154.76 - 2157.76] down and a couple years later the fight
[2156.36 - 2159.96] won't be so
[2157.76 - 2161.56] hard and the person will get stronger
[2159.96 - 2163.36] and stronger less occurrences will
[2161.56 - 2166.40] happen less addictions to Adrenaline
[2163.36 - 2168.12] will happen and less mercury in the body
[2166.40 - 2169.68] will happen and somebody can actually
[2168.12 - 2171.72] heal from bulimia without being
[2169.68 - 2173.44] force-fed massive drugs told they have
[2171.72 - 2175.48] this unbelievable mental illness and
[2173.44 - 2177.88] suffering occurring this is serious
[2175.48 - 2179.20] stuff and you know this can happen of
[2177.88 - 2181.16] course they need a support system
[2179.20 - 2183.48] anybody with any illness especially Bia
[2181.16 - 2185.36] or anorexia needs a support system and I
[2183.48 - 2187.20] know that I know that's a difficult part
[2185.36 - 2189.60] if that's not there boy does that make
[2187.20 - 2192.36] it hard and I get
[2189.60 - 2194.88] it I get
[2192.36 - 2196.36] it so maybe you know somebody and you
[2194.88 - 2199.48] give him a little support on it a little
[2196.36 - 2201.08] bit goes a long way a little bit goes a
[2199.48 - 2202.56] long way you tell us somebody with
[2201.08 - 2204.24] bulimia that the whole world isn't
[2202.56 - 2207.52] eating disorder they're not the only
[2204.24 - 2210.04] ones you tell somebody that so the shame
[2207.52 - 2211.84] falls down and and gets Stripped Away
[2210.04 - 2213.64] the shame and the guilt and everything
[2211.84 - 2215.68] else that comes with it that shouldn't
[2213.64 - 2217.48] be
[2215.68 - 2218.88] there
[2217.48 - 2221.64] that shouldn't be there because that
[2218.88 - 2223.40] gets in the way too like no other so if
[2221.64 - 2225.08] you know somebody with anorex you tell
[2223.40 - 2226.92] them look everybody's got an eating
[2225.08 - 2228.96] disorder to some degree which just yours
[2226.92 - 2231.68] is yeah yours has gotten to a serious
[2228.96 - 2233.52] point we need to do something about it
[2231.68 - 2235.08] absolutely but it's important that
[2233.52 - 2236.60] people and that was another thing too
[2235.08 - 2238.80] that helped people with bulimia and
[2236.60 - 2240.72] anorexia that I met over the years and
[2238.80 - 2242.20] many of them was that they were like
[2240.72 - 2244.32] what do you mean everybody else has an
[2242.20 - 2245.68] eating disorder I said no everybody else
[2244.32 - 2247.44] has an eating disorder I don't care who
[2245.68 - 2249.08] it is I don't care if somebody thinks
[2247.44 - 2250.48] they got it all sewed up something
[2249.08 - 2253.76] something's going
[2250.48 - 2255.80] on something's going on here's the thing
[2253.76 - 2257.40] we all have to eat we all have to eat to
[2255.80 - 2259.20] survive we all have to eat to live we
[2257.40 - 2261.36] have to eat to live here on Earth we
[2259.20 - 2263.04] have to survive that's our fuel intake
[2261.36 - 2265.32] that's what does it that's what's
[2263.04 - 2268.56] critical we need that fuel intake that
[2265.32 - 2270.44] is so important so it's easy for
[2268.56 - 2272.28] anything to to slip through her fingers
[2270.44 - 2273.80] in one way or another it's easy to eat
[2272.28 - 2275.40] the wrong things it's easy to drink
[2273.80 - 2276.64] alcohol it's easy to do things that
[2275.40 - 2278.24] we're not supposed to do starve
[2276.64 - 2281.44] ourselves or whatever it
[2278.24 - 2284.36] is that's how fast and and and
[2281.44 - 2289.00] easy that Eating Disorders occur and can
[2284.36 - 2291.96] occur it's that easy so so let's go into
[2289.00 - 2294.16] some other stuff here anorexia
[2291.96 - 2296.40] definitely Mercury problem also a
[2294.16 - 2298.76] percentage of of if something terrible
[2296.40 - 2301.84] happened meaning something really
[2298.76 - 2304.40] really intense emotionally some kind of
[2301.84 - 2307.28] experience some kind of abuse something
[2304.40 - 2309.00] happened um that that and here's a
[2307.28 - 2310.60] problem with anorexia and bulimia you
[2309.00 - 2313.08] can have a combination of both you could
[2310.60 - 2316.76] have mostly Mercury and then yes some
[2313.08 - 2319.80] kind of emotional physical abuse happens
[2316.76 - 2321.68] too in that person's life and then you
[2319.80 - 2324.28] got the combination of
[2321.68 - 2326.04] both so with anorexia it's about getting
[2324.28 - 2327.68] you know it's about the heavy metals too
[2326.04 - 2331.08] getting the heavy metals out in some way
[2327.68 - 2332.68] some some some way some shape I noticed
[2331.08 - 2334.56] that I've seen fruit heal people with
[2332.68 - 2336.96] anorexia more than any other food
[2334.56 - 2338.24] because mentally it fit in perfectly
[2336.96 - 2340.12] where they felt they were eating
[2338.24 - 2342.00] something healthy they but then what
[2340.12 - 2344.08] they were getting were carbohydrates
[2342.00 - 2346.60] that were so needed for every organ so
[2344.08 - 2348.44] they didn't atrophy and with anorexia
[2346.60 - 2350.20] your organs atrophy but you can get
[2348.44 - 2352.56] those organs to come back but they
[2350.20 - 2355.32] atrophy everything gets smaller pancreas
[2352.56 - 2356.88] gets really small pancreas gets really
[2355.32 - 2359.28] small and you can bring that pancreas
[2356.88 - 2362.36] back everything gets small brain gets
[2359.28 - 2365.32] smaller pancreas gets smaller it's not
[2362.36 - 2369.08] just about thinning out losing weight
[2365.32 - 2370.32] and being really really extremely thin
[2369.08 - 2373.24] it's not just about it's about the
[2370.32 - 2374.92] organs the atrophy and I know I I know
[2373.24 - 2376.20] there's there's some doctors that know
[2374.92 - 2377.76] that that the organs atrophy they
[2376.20 - 2379.24] totally understand that that's that I
[2377.76 - 2383.16] don't think that's
[2379.24 - 2384.84] new but what is new is that fruit is
[2383.16 - 2387.20] critical for bringing back organs that
[2384.84 - 2390.00] are atrophied with somebody with
[2387.20 - 2392.00] anorexia and that's a big deal that's a
[2390.00 - 2394.92] big
[2392.00 - 2396.84] deal and in with somebody with anorexia
[2394.92 - 2399.88] when you have the mercury poisoning in
[2396.84 - 2402.56] the brain sending signals not to eat
[2399.88 - 2404.40] creating nausea in the Vagas nerve
[2402.56 - 2407.68] creating nausea and no appetite in the
[2404.40 - 2410.48] Vegas nerve because you can get a signal
[2407.68 - 2412.52] that goes wrong with Mercury creating
[2410.48 - 2415.96] non-
[2412.52 - 2417.32] hunger and you know with anorexia when
[2415.96 - 2420.16] that happens fruit is the greatest
[2417.32 - 2422.56] weapon it's the greatest weapon because
[2420.16 - 2424.24] it doesn't feel it doesn't feel so
[2422.56 - 2426.04] overburdening it doesn't feel like you
[2424.24 - 2428.72] just ate a loaf of bad bread it doesn't
[2426.04 - 2430.48] feel like you ate you know a steak and
[2428.72 - 2432.24] somebody with anorexia forcing them to
[2430.48 - 2433.76] eat chicken or forcing them to eat steak
[2432.24 - 2436.68] could be
[2433.76 - 2437.96] disastrous very difficult on them very
[2436.68 - 2440.16] difficult cuz that's what happens it's
[2437.96 - 2442.24] like eat e eat person has to eat we got
[2440.16 - 2443.32] to get milk in them we got to get it's
[2442.24 - 2445.64] all the wrong
[2443.32 - 2448.64] Foods someone with anorexia you got to
[2445.64 - 2451.40] get avocado milk in them you blend
[2448.64 - 2453.56] avocado with water in the
[2451.40 - 2455.00] blender and that's something that's
[2453.56 - 2457.56] really really good for somebody with
[2455.00 - 2459.20] anorexia got to do banana milk throwing
[2457.56 - 2462.20] bananas in the blender with water and
[2459.20 - 2463.84] doing lots of banana milk it's critical
[2462.20 - 2465.60] for somebody with anorexia because once
[2463.84 - 2468.20] you feed the brain and your brain make
[2465.60 - 2469.92] the brain stronger even if there's
[2468.20 - 2471.28] vomiting in between this with both
[2469.92 - 2473.64] anorexia and
[2471.28 - 2475.56] bulimia if you feed the brain when you
[2473.64 - 2477.96] do get a chance or say with somebody
[2475.56 - 2480.32] with anorexia that they you know I
[2477.96 - 2481.96] listen I you may be dealing with this
[2480.32 - 2485.76] and suffering with the anorexia for
[2481.96 - 2487.96] years you you know better than anybody
[2485.76 - 2489.96] but if you do eat something you might
[2487.96 - 2492.12] not eat something for a long time after
[2489.96 - 2494.72] that if that happens we want that
[2492.12 - 2497.80] something to actually pay off so if you
[2494.72 - 2500.28] get the banana milk in you or you get
[2497.80 - 2503.16] some melon in you and you get the the
[2500.28 - 2505.00] critical carbohydrates to the brain and
[2503.16 - 2506.84] to the organs to stop atrophying and
[2505.00 - 2509.44] then you end up not eating because the
[2506.84 - 2512.60] because of the reasons of everything
[2509.44 - 2514.20] above with anorexia then then at least
[2512.60 - 2516.64] you fed the
[2514.20 - 2520.52] organs even if the weight's not coming
[2516.64 - 2520.52] back yet something to to
[2521.40 - 2525.64] understand you
[2523.36 - 2528.24] know people who drink coffee every
[2525.64 - 2530.48] single day and they have to rely on it
[2528.24 - 2532.20] that's a disorder that's a disorder
[2530.48 - 2534.00] right there it's as simple as that
[2532.20 - 2535.40] people eat too much chocolate every day
[2534.00 - 2537.48] that's an eating
[2535.40 - 2539.48] disorder people have to eat chocolate
[2537.48 - 2540.68] every day and then they have to switch
[2539.48 - 2541.92] and get the better chocolate and they're
[2540.68 - 2544.28] still eating it every single day to
[2541.92 - 2545.48] throw it in their smoothies they're told
[2544.28 - 2547.24] by some experts out there it's the
[2545.48 - 2549.48] greatest thing for your Health that's an
[2547.24 - 2551.12] eating disorder I mean they're high on
[2549.48 - 2552.56] chocolate you can't tell but you're
[2551.12 - 2553.92] you're high on chocolate all day long
[2552.56 - 2555.64] and what that does is that does weird
[2553.92 - 2558.32] things it suppresses hunger in different
[2555.64 - 2560.72] ways it does different stuff it maxes
[2558.32 - 2563.48] out the adrenals you could still have
[2560.72 - 2566.20] some chocolate but that literally con
[2563.48 - 2568.88] constitutes an eating disorder I yeah
[2566.20 - 2571.24] this is a tough show this is a tough
[2568.88 - 2572.72] show we got to stay light-hearted about
[2571.24 - 2574.16] it at the same time when it comes down
[2572.72 - 2576.36] to those
[2574.16 - 2578.76] things it you know and then the
[2576.36 - 2581.08] obsession about foods to
[2578.76 - 2582.64] avoid Obsession about foods to avoid now
[2581.08 - 2584.68] if you have a reason why you're avoiding
[2582.64 - 2586.28] a food if you know you got like the
[2584.68 - 2588.44] Epstein bar virus you don't want to feed
[2586.28 - 2591.76] it eggs you better believe you need to
[2588.44 - 2594.08] avoid eggs absolutely you have to avoid
[2591.76 - 2596.72] eggs you need to you don't want to feed
[2594.08 - 2598.72] a virus of food once you learn that
[2596.72 - 2602.08] that's what feeds a
[2598.72 - 2604.20] food but if you're avoiding a food
[2602.08 - 2606.52] there's no reason at all you're not
[2604.20 - 2608.28] dealing with a health problem and you're
[2606.52 - 2610.76] avoiding a food that's really not that
[2608.28 - 2612.28] bad for anybody and you're avoiding it
[2610.76 - 2614.92] because you heard something about it and
[2612.28 - 2618.04] you're avoiding with everything you
[2614.92 - 2619.36] got it's probably not there's probably
[2618.04 - 2622.28] other things you do in your diet that
[2619.36 - 2623.76] are probably worse put it that way I
[2622.28 - 2625.76] mean there's so many different ways to
[2623.76 - 2627.96] go it's unbelievable and then there's
[2625.76 - 2629.28] underlying illness freeding disorders
[2627.96 - 2631.56] there's
[2629.28 - 2632.92] hypoglycemia there's adrenaline issues I
[2631.56 - 2635.20] mean there's adrenal fatigue
[2632.92 - 2637.12] hypoglycemia electrolyte deficiencies
[2635.20 - 2639.08] neurotransmitter deficiencies in people
[2637.12 - 2641.28] every single day people suffering with
[2639.08 - 2642.88] all kinds of problems people that are
[2641.28 - 2644.48] getting diagnosed with bipolar but
[2642.88 - 2646.76] really they're having serious problems
[2644.48 - 2649.76] with their blood sugar and they're
[2646.76 - 2652.08] diagnosed with bipolar being bipolar and
[2649.76 - 2654.00] and really they just have a blood sugar
[2652.08 - 2655.80] problem where it's going up and down too
[2654.00 - 2658.40] fast and it can't stabilize because of
[2655.80 - 2661.08] adrenals in the liver because the liver
[2658.40 - 2663.24] is sluggish there's 15y olds 18y olds
[2661.08 - 2666.12] 19y olds were really sluggish
[2663.24 - 2667.88] livers and and so they can't balance the
[2666.12 - 2669.60] can't balance the glucose in in their
[2667.88 - 2671.40] blood so they're they're having mood
[2669.60 - 2673.04] swings left and right up and down then
[2671.40 - 2674.68] they get thrown in diagnosis then they
[2673.04 - 2676.76] get put on riddle and then they get put
[2674.68 - 2679.40] on they get put on all these kinds of
[2676.76 - 2683.28] drugs and and whatever it
[2679.40 - 2684.88] is and then you have that going on when
[2683.28 - 2686.92] really and all that does is end up
[2684.88 - 2689.16] creating an eating disorder when really
[2686.92 - 2691.20] someone needs to teach somebody that has
[2689.16 - 2693.08] hypoglycemia caused by either adrenal
[2691.20 - 2694.56] fatigue when they're young or a liver
[2693.08 - 2696.64] problem how to
[2694.56 - 2698.40] eat cuz if you if you don't then it
[2696.64 - 2701.12] could become a serious eating disorder
[2698.40 - 2703.68] and lead to an eating
[2701.12 - 2705.08] disorder and so for instance when you
[2703.68 - 2707.00] have that kind of up and down in the
[2705.08 - 2709.16] mood swings you have to eat every hour
[2707.00 - 2711.56] hour and a half and it has to be
[2709.16 - 2712.92] something that has a sodium in it like a
[2711.56 - 2715.00] sodium in it in the sense where it has
[2712.92 - 2718.48] to be celery stick it has to be some
[2715.00 - 2720.64] spinach it has to be um um you know it
[2718.48 - 2723.12] has to be some spinach celery has to be
[2720.64 - 2729.04] some guacamole has to be handful of nuts
[2723.12 - 2732.68] has to be um uh cucumber slices
[2729.04 - 2734.24] apples has to be lemon water all these
[2732.68 - 2737.36] different things you need in and out of
[2734.24 - 2739.08] it all um raw honey lemon water that's a
[2737.36 - 2740.72] great mix if you put that together and
[2739.08 - 2742.92] you can even put a little touch of sea
[2740.72 - 2744.36] salt in there if you wanted to and make
[2742.92 - 2745.68] a drink out of that there's different
[2744.36 - 2747.96] things there different ways of keeping
[2745.68 - 2749.80] bruly balanced or maybe you're just
[2747.96 - 2751.60] having some trail mix but it's every
[2749.80 - 2753.24] hour or maybe you're just having some
[2751.60 - 2756.40] hummus every
[2753.24 - 2758.36] hour but that's what you need when it
[2756.40 - 2760.40] comes down to anybody with any kind of
[2758.36 - 2762.32] hypoglycemia that's getting mood swings
[2760.40 - 2764.16] meaning the hypoglycemia mood swings
[2762.32 - 2764.84] where it's like up and down and all over
[2764.16 - 2768.04] the
[2764.84 - 2769.52] place you have to eat like this and then
[2768.04 - 2770.72] someone could say hey that person is the
[2769.52 - 2772.08] eating disorder because they have to eat
[2770.72 - 2773.84] every hour to keep themselves balance
[2772.08 - 2775.20] now they have a real reason why they
[2773.84 - 2776.84] have to they have a condition that's
[2775.20 - 2778.88] developing and this is a real way of
[2776.84 - 2780.56] fixing it just like if someone has
[2778.88 - 2782.04] straight adrenal fatigue this is a real
[2780.56 - 2784.60] way of fixing
[2782.04 - 2786.56] it but the eating disorder can come from
[2784.60 - 2788.56] somebody else complaining to bet to
[2786.56 - 2791.00] somebody about what they're doing and
[2788.56 - 2792.52] how they don't like it that alone can
[2791.00 - 2794.60] can be challenging and creating a
[2792.52 - 2796.56] disorder I mean there's also blame
[2794.60 - 2797.64] everywhere everybody's blaming everybody
[2796.56 - 2799.24] what they're eating and if they're
[2797.64 - 2801.24] eating right everybody has their own
[2799.24 - 2803.56] idea of how to eat and what to eat it's
[2801.24 - 2805.96] insane and that alone can create to
[2803.56 - 2807.08] eating disorders in every single person
[2805.96 - 2808.68] I'm going to tell you right now the
[2807.08 - 2810.60] information I've ever given out in food
[2808.68 - 2812.28] for illnesses and food for problems and
[2810.60 - 2815.16] everything else and how you eat there's
[2812.28 - 2817.12] reasons behind it reasons that research
[2815.16 - 2819.36] signed stor understand or reasons that
[2817.12 - 2821.72] are just that are above the trends out
[2819.36 - 2823.84] there about how to stay healthy and
[2821.72 - 2826.68] heal and that's
[2823.84 - 2829.44] different and I'm saying that's not even
[2826.68 - 2831.08] 100% perfect in the sense because if
[2829.44 - 2833.04] someone's doing that and they finally
[2831.08 - 2835.48] heal and they're better they might be
[2833.04 - 2837.36] afraid to stop I've had people that have
[2835.48 - 2839.52] healed themselves from the worst worst
[2837.36 - 2840.84] adrenal fatigue on the planet I mean
[2839.52 - 2842.24] literally they were just they couldn't
[2840.84 - 2844.64] get out of bed they had neuro fatigue
[2842.24 - 2846.12] and adrenal fatigue from from a virus
[2844.64 - 2848.52] and from the fact that they're adrenals
[2846.12 - 2850.96] were spent I couldn't even get a bed I
[2848.52 - 2853.32] had them eating every 45 minutes every
[2850.96 - 2855.32] 45 minutes I recovered them got them
[2853.32 - 2857.32] moving again got them out of bed got
[2855.32 - 2858.84] their life back 3 years later they were
[2857.32 - 2860.56] stronger than ever but afraid to drop
[2858.84 - 2863.04] the every 45 minutes they would call me
[2860.56 - 2865.36] and say look I'm afraid I'm afraid to
[2863.04 - 2867.92] stop eat it's to stop eating every 45
[2865.36 - 2870.04] minutes because it saved my life I would
[2867.92 - 2871.92] say no you're good you're acting like
[2870.04 - 2873.80] you're you're acting like you're going
[2871.92 - 2876.00] to get your eating disorder now you can
[2873.80 - 2880.20] go an hour and a half you got strong you
[2876.00 - 2882.76] can go 2 hours you got strong you can go
[2880.20 - 2886.08] if you had to you can go 3 hours if you
[2882.76 - 2888.28] had to you got strong and then they have
[2886.08 - 2890.72] they have to break it so even when you
[2888.28 - 2892.56] heal somebody they can get a little bit
[2890.72 - 2894.08] of a of an OCD or a little bit of a
[2892.56 - 2895.56] eating sore even after you healed them
[2894.08 - 2896.96] from a terrible illness or something
[2895.56 - 2899.80] that was terrible or something that was
[2896.96 - 2902.48] keeping them down in their life so just
[2899.80 - 2904.24] imagine when that's not even in the mix
[2902.48 - 2905.80] and all the people out there just this
[2904.24 - 2907.44] is how you eat this is how you eat this
[2905.80 - 2909.44] is the new way this is the diet you want
[2907.44 - 2910.96] to be on um you have to have all this
[2909.44 - 2913.92] chocolate you have to have all this you
[2910.96 - 2913.92] have to have this it's
[2914.00 - 2917.52] unbelievable and yeah if you're anorexic
[2916.16 - 2919.04] that just means you're you got a mental
[2917.52 - 2921.84] illness and that's really what it is and
[2919.04 - 2924.32] you need to eat eat eat eat
[2921.84 - 2925.72] eat there's more to it than that of
[2924.32 - 2930.04] course you have to eat but there's more
[2925.72 - 2931.40] to it than that there's so much there
[2930.04 - 2935.16] there's so much
[2931.40 - 2936.64] there the people that avoid food all day
[2935.16 - 2937.52] and drink at night that's a terrible
[2936.64 - 2939.48] eating
[2937.52 - 2940.80] disorder I mean there's a people that
[2939.48 - 2942.04] they're out in the workforce every day
[2940.80 - 2944.52] they're out there every day they avoid
[2942.04 - 2946.68] food all day they just avoid food all
[2944.52 - 2949.20] day long well then they then they have
[2946.68 - 2952.16] these reasons
[2949.20 - 2953.68] why I that's a that's a major drinking I
[2952.16 - 2955.28] mean that's a major drinking disorder
[2953.68 - 2958.44] too that can happen but there's people
[2955.28 - 2961.40] that avoid food all day that don't drink
[2958.44 - 2962.72] and then eat that one meal at night you
[2961.40 - 2964.72] know and and mean but there's some
[2962.72 - 2967.08] people that legitly they they have a job
[2964.72 - 2970.28] and they're forced to do that I mean I
[2967.08 - 2973.08] know nurses that literally don't have a
[2970.28 - 2975.52] a minute to eat anything I mean they're
[2973.08 - 2976.96] running around all day long it's so
[2975.52 - 2978.72] difficult for them to even have a snack
[2976.96 - 2980.40] I mean you might be one of them right it
[2978.72 - 2982.56] is so difficult to even have a snack or
[2980.40 - 2984.28] to eat right or for lunch and and and
[2982.56 - 2986.20] the lunch the lunch room in the
[2984.28 - 2987.84] hospitals alone are just terrifying
[2986.20 - 2990.72] they're better than they were 20 years
[2987.84 - 2992.16] ago but they can they're still not that
[2990.72 - 2993.28] great especially if you have a health
[2992.16 - 2994.84] condition you're trying to work with or
[2993.28 - 2997.48] adrenal fatigue and you're pushed all
[2994.84 - 2999.08] day long as an nurse and at home you get
[2997.48 - 3001.88] home and you're just eating and eating I
[2999.08 - 3004.04] totally understand but this it's yeah so
[3001.88 - 3005.60] it's hard to avoid now creating some
[3004.04 - 3007.72] kind of small eating disorder because
[3005.60 - 3010.04] you're forced into it you're pushed into
[3007.72 - 3011.72] it totally agree well let's be happy
[3010.04 - 3013.44] about something it's okay to have Eating
[3011.72 - 3015.12] Disorders okay it's okay to have some
[3013.44 - 3017.24] kind of eating disorder and guess what
[3015.12 - 3019.68] we all got them we all got them in some
[3017.24 - 3023.36] way some shape some fashion somehow we
[3019.68 - 3025.56] all have some or one or something from
[3023.36 - 3028.60] high school kids to college kids to
[3025.56 - 3031.56] adults in Workforce to um to to the
[3028.60 - 3036.52] older generation to Elders I've Seen It
[3031.56 - 3039.84] All I've Seen It All I've seen people in
[3036.52 - 3041.48] their 80s eat a big big pie filled with
[3039.84 - 3044.36] wheat and lard and everything but eat
[3041.48 - 3047.40] the whole damn pie like a whole
[3044.36 - 3049.72] pie and and you know like 85 years old
[3047.40 - 3053.40] but but eating a whole pie at
[3049.72 - 3055.80] once I've seen it and you know and then
[3053.40 - 3057.80] stuffed and can't breathe how how I've I
[3055.80 - 3059.44] seen it I've had people call me in that
[3057.80 - 3063.40] condition or I've had somebody call for
[3059.44 - 3063.40] the because the grandfather ate a whole
[3064.48 - 3069.36] pie I've seen it
[3066.64 - 3070.72] all and and and and the grandfather
[3069.36 - 3072.84] would tell you he's never had an eating
[3070.72 - 3074.52] disorder his whole life he' been eating
[3072.84 - 3076.96] fine his whole
[3074.52 - 3079.64] life and then then I then I hear from
[3076.96 - 3081.72] the grandchild I hear for the grandchild
[3079.64 - 3083.52] um his granddaughter that he's been he's
[3081.72 - 3087.24] been eating till he can't breathe on and
[3083.52 - 3091.16] off his whole life always been stuffing
[3087.24 - 3093.96] himself so I mean it's just like this
[3091.16 - 3095.44] it's like this getting your liver
[3093.96 - 3097.36] stronger is important with any kind of
[3095.44 - 3099.72] eating disorder that means getting lots
[3097.36 - 3101.60] of leafy greens when you can getting
[3099.72 - 3103.88] lots of fruits and leafy greens if you
[3101.60 - 3105.88] eat animal protein minimize it to one
[3103.88 - 3107.44] serving a day there's nothing wrong with
[3105.88 - 3108.96] that so what I'm not against animal
[3107.44 - 3110.60] protein you could have one serving a day
[3108.96 - 3112.84] of it if you're a vegan don't eat
[3110.60 - 3114.64] barrels and barrels and nuts have a
[3112.84 - 3116.96] handful of nuts periodically throughout
[3114.64 - 3118.60] the day a a couple of handfuls do more
[3116.96 - 3121.32] leafy greens do more
[3118.60 - 3123.04] fruits do some winter squash do things
[3121.32 - 3124.68] like that if you're 100% raw you don't
[3123.04 - 3126.28] have to do you know a winter squash
[3124.68 - 3128.00] that's cooked or whatever you can be all
[3126.28 - 3129.60] raw do lots of leafy greens lots of
[3128.00 - 3131.52] fruits if you're plant-based and all raw
[3129.60 - 3133.84] you can do some nuts and seeds if you're
[3131.52 - 3135.52] vegetarian if you're vegetarian try not
[3133.84 - 3136.96] to you know overdo fish make sure it's
[3135.52 - 3138.92] salmon if you're doing fish it's a
[3136.96 - 3141.00] better one than most of
[3138.92 - 3142.96] them and if you're you know if you're a
[3141.00 - 3144.80] meat eater and you're big on meat eater
[3142.96 - 3146.56] meat eating just do you know one serving
[3144.80 - 3148.96] of meat day make sure there's more leafy
[3146.56 - 3151.28] greens more vegetables more fruits
[3148.96 - 3153.52] especially leafy greens in your diet to
[3151.28 - 3155.16] help your liver clean up it can prevent
[3153.52 - 3156.92] any kind of eating disorder getting the
[3155.16 - 3159.32] liver cleaned up getting more fruit in
[3156.92 - 3161.52] the diet gets glucose to the liver and
[3159.32 - 3165.80] the Brain which can avoid even the most
[3161.52 - 3167.84] basic food disorder eating disorder it's
[3165.80 - 3170.00] incredible if you're feeling like you
[3167.84 - 3171.96] got any kind of Health concern at all
[3170.00 - 3174.04] you want to keep your adrenal strong you
[3171.96 - 3175.48] want to eat every 2 hours if you feel
[3174.04 - 3177.08] like you got adrenal fatigue you eat eat
[3175.48 - 3179.24] every hour if you feel like you got
[3177.08 - 3181.00] neuro fatigue you eat every hour and you
[3179.24 - 3183.28] just do this every day and you have
[3181.00 - 3185.28] snacks all day long and you keep enough
[3183.28 - 3188.92] food going in that's important for any
[3185.28 - 3191.44] kind of adrenal issues even liver issues
[3188.92 - 3194.88] even brain issues bipolar ups and downs
[3191.44 - 3198.44] mood swings all that kind of thing okay
[3194.88 - 3200.16] very important ADHD all of it you want
[3198.44 - 3202.00] to keep food coming and you don't want
[3200.16 - 3205.40] there's nothing worse than having add or
[3202.00 - 3207.68] ADHD and not eating for 4 hours but then
[3205.40 - 3210.24] taking medication but not eating for 4
[3207.68 - 3211.68] hours and that's a disaster for for an
[3210.24 - 3214.08] eating disorder like that's that's
[3211.68 - 3216.52] heading to an eating disorder that alone
[3214.08 - 3218.96] I'm giving you every T tidbit I can in
[3216.52 - 3221.96] the in the time we
[3218.96 - 3226.00] have so these are some this is this is
[3221.96 - 3227.68] all this is all just part of it all and
[3226.00 - 3230.16] I know I'm harsh when I say look I know
[3227.68 - 3231.84] I'm harsh I when I say anyone who still
[3230.16 - 3234.20] thinks the brain is made out of fat we
[3231.84 - 3235.44] being told right now by professionals is
[3234.20 - 3237.96] professionals just don't know no the
[3235.44 - 3240.52] brain isn't made out of fat it's got
[3237.96 - 3242.08] traces of fats and they are important
[3240.52 - 3243.76] but they're nothing like the importance
[3242.08 - 3245.08] of the carbohydrates and the glycogen
[3243.76 - 3247.60] that's stored inside the brain that
[3245.08 - 3249.36] keeps electrical impulses moving and it
[3247.60 - 3251.20] keeps the neurotransmitter strong
[3249.36 - 3252.76] glucose is actually one of the most
[3251.20 - 3254.56] critical components to an electrical
[3252.76 - 3257.76] impulse inside the brain running down a
[3254.56 - 3260.32] neurot neuron to save your butt every
[3257.76 - 3263.00] day and this is done through
[3260.32 - 3265.28] carbohydrates don't eat donuts don't eat
[3263.00 - 3267.00] bad Bagels don't eat tons of loaf don't
[3265.28 - 3268.44] eat loaves of bread it's not kind the
[3267.00 - 3270.08] kind of stuff the carbohydrates I'm

[3270.08 - 3274.60] sweet potatoes the regular potatoes if
[3272.92 - 3276.84] yet if you don't like those do lots of
