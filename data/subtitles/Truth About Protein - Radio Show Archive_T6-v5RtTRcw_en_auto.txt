[0.24 - 4.24] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.28 - 5.92] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.24 - 7.88] show where each week I talk about the
[5.92 - 10.52] most advanced healing
[7.88 - 12.92] information much of which is not found
[10.52 - 15.56] anywhere else and is decades ahead of
[12.92 - 17.48] what's out there now and that's how it
[15.56 - 18.88] has to be in order to heal because
[17.48 - 20.48] what's going on in the alternative
[18.88 - 22.00] environment for medicine in the
[20.48 - 24.04] conventional environment for medicine
[22.00 - 25.92] isn't really healing anybody well I
[24.04 - 28.40] can't say that entirely people get a
[25.92 - 30.36] little bit better there are some amazing
[28.40 - 31.96] surgeons out there too that remove
[30.36 - 33.56] things out of people's bodies if
[31.96 - 34.84] somebody gets an appendicitis if
[33.56 - 36.96] somebody has an aneurysm there's
[34.84 - 40.32] incredible surgeons so but I'm talking
[36.96 - 44.08] about chronic illness that's where the
[40.32 - 46.48] disaster lies it doesn't lie with with a
[44.08 - 49.24] liver transplant we got amazing people
[46.48 - 51.72] out there to to remove a liver put one
[49.24 - 53.32] in I mean you know we're in a great
[51.72 - 55.00] place uh medical science and research is
[53.32 - 57.48] in a great place when we're doing that
[55.00 - 60.28] kind of thing but where are we with
[57.48 - 63.52] chronic illness it's disastrous I'm
[60.28 - 65.52] sorry to say but disastrous and the best
[63.52 - 68.40] information out there in the internet or
[65.52 - 72.20] or in books or wherever you can find
[68.40 - 74.36] isn't enough because we have 250 million
[72.20 - 77.80] Americans alone and I'm not even talking
[74.36 - 80.28] about global and and 250 million
[77.80 - 82.08] Americans that are sick with symptoms
[80.28 - 84.20] out of the over 300 million plus
[82.08 - 85.96] Americans that we have here and that are
[84.20 - 88.16] sick with symptoms and different
[85.96 - 90.36] conditions many diagnosed wrong many
[88.16 - 92.16] symptoms they don't no one
[90.36 - 93.80] understands that's where we are with
[92.16 - 96.16] chronic illness so does this radio show
[93.80 - 98.00] have to be ahead of the time darn right
[96.16 - 100.04] you better believe it has to be ahead of
[98.00 - 101.96] the time and it has to be ahead of
[100.04 - 105.20] everything else and it is and that's the
[101.96 - 107.04] whole point this radio show it has clean
[105.20 - 108.60] and pure information if you're brand new
[107.04 - 110.20] to this in if you're brand new to this
[108.60 - 112.32] radio show medical medium radio show and
[110.20 - 113.68] everything else around it make sure that
[112.32 - 117.32] you tell friends too that the
[113.68 - 120.40] information here is not backed by agenda
[117.32 - 122.56] driven money stuff like that all that
[120.40 - 124.76] crazy stuff that's in the industry like
[122.56 - 126.72] the medical lobbyists and everything
[124.76 - 128.88] else around it that are involved with
[126.72 - 132.16] making sure that conventional medicine
[128.88 - 135.04] is poisoned meaning as far as for
[132.16 - 137.72] chronic illness and alternative medicine
[135.04 - 140.12] is poisoned for chronic illness so that
[137.72 - 141.88] when you go and you try to find help you
[140.12 - 143.36] get told you got Lyme disease when you
[141.88 - 144.72] may not have Lyme disease or you get
[143.36 - 146.68] told you have multiple sclerosis when
[144.72 - 150.08] you don't have multiple sclerosis or you
[146.68 - 151.92] never get told what causes anything or
[150.08 - 154.32] it it could be anything going on tingles
[151.92 - 156.20] and numbness aches and pains blurry eyes
[154.32 - 158.24] brain fog confusion then you're told
[156.20 - 160.44] it's something in your gut when that's
[158.24 - 162.36] not really what it is it's one thing
[160.44 - 163.88] after another you got Ser there's people
[162.36 - 165.64] out there walking around fatigue chronic
[163.88 - 167.80] fatigue everywhere with all kinds they
[165.64 - 170.64] can't do anything they all kinds of
[167.80 - 172.80] symptoms weak Limbs and frustration
[170.64 - 175.08] anxiety depression and not getting the
[172.80 - 178.28] answers so when it comes down to that
[175.08 - 180.08] science is behind and studies do not the
[178.28 - 182.60] whole thing studies and research search
[180.08 - 184.08] don't really match up to anything with
[182.60 - 187.40] everybody's suffering from aches and
[184.08 - 189.52] pains joint pain nerve pain neuropathy
[187.40 - 192.24] everything going on all of it is still a
[189.52 - 194.12] mystery migraines headaches you name it
[192.24 - 195.64] have I said enough and that's still a
[194.12 - 198.04] mystery to research and science it's
[195.64 - 199.52] still a mystery to to most professionals
[198.04 - 200.64] so this is pretty actually all
[199.52 - 202.84] professionals really when you think
[200.64 - 204.96] about it unless they know what's causing
[202.84 - 207.76] everything now the reason why I'm saying
[204.96 - 209.88] this and being so strong about all this
[207.76 - 211.48] all of this is because we're going into
[209.88 - 213.56] we're going into protein is where we're
[211.48 - 215.88] heading and before we go into protein I
[213.56 - 218.00] just have to let everybody know that the
[215.88 - 219.96] information here in the show isn't
[218.00 - 221.68] because I believe in one thing or I
[219.96 - 223.28] believe in another thing or I got some
[221.68 - 225.92] belief system and I'm going to I'm going
[223.28 - 227.52] to shove a whole bunch of protein crap
[225.92 - 230.28] right down your throat a whole bunch of
[227.52 - 232.72] protein nonsense and knowledge down your
[230.28 - 234.44] throat maybe science and and research
[232.72 - 235.92] believes you need this amount of protein
[234.44 - 237.60] I'm just going to take that and just
[235.92 - 239.08] shove that right at you no we're not
[237.60 - 241.84] going to do that we need the truth
[239.08 - 244.24] instead we can't get tricked and we
[241.84 - 246.32] can't get fooled because let me tell you
[244.24 - 248.24] something when it comes down to the
[246.32 - 250.68] protein and the protein whole phenomenon
[248.24 - 252.16] to the whole Obsession and everything
[250.68 - 254.72] about protein we're getting tricked
[252.16 - 256.52] we're getting fooled if anybody's ever
[254.72 - 258.20] played a trick on you you didn't like it
[256.52 - 260.36] I can guarantee you that I'm sure you
[258.20 - 262.68] didn't but if someone plays a trick on
[260.36 - 264.56] you and it's your whole lifetime and
[262.68 - 266.04] your family's lifetime before you and
[264.56 - 268.00] your mother and father's Lifetime and
[266.04 - 269.64] your grandparents lifetime before you
[268.00 - 272.44] and everybody else's lifetime before you
[269.64 - 276.88] and after you your children and this the
[272.44 - 278.76] same trick the same joke is being played
[276.88 - 282.28] on your children and their children it's
[278.76 - 285.92] not a good thing and the protein problem
[282.28 - 287.20] is this very trick and that's the big
[285.92 - 288.44] that's the deal so we're going to go
[287.20 - 290.40] right into that we have to the
[288.44 - 293.04] information that show is pure untampered
[290.40 - 296.00] with it's not
[293.04 - 298.60] supported by the thumb on the scale
[296.00 - 301.12] research and science that forces studies
[298.60 - 303.72] to go a certain direction to take care
[301.12 - 305.44] of investors that put their money in it
[303.72 - 307.08] so everybody's happy except for the
[305.44 - 309.28] person with chronic illness well we have
[307.08 - 312.16] nothing to do with that and thank God
[309.28 - 313.96] and I'm so darn happy we have nothing to
[312.16 - 316.24] do with that and that's why people are
[313.96 - 318.28] healing check out check out medical
[316.24 - 321.60] medium books you know my books check out
[318.28 - 323.52] the whole thing learn and heal and it's
[321.60 - 325.36] really important to do that so let's go
[323.52 - 327.32] right into protein look I sound a little
[325.36 - 328.96] extra edgy today a little extra snarky
[327.32 - 331.64] on this but there's there's a reason for
[328.96 - 335.08] this because protein has been like it's
[331.64 - 338.36] like the thorn in people's sides because
[335.08 - 341.40] the minute you follow the protein law
[338.36 - 344.56] the law of protein you get yourself
[341.40 - 347.08] messed up you fall into a trap you fall
[344.56 - 349.80] into a ditch you step into a pothole you
[347.08 - 352.40] get yourself in big trouble and you have
[349.80 - 353.56] to know this for your own good it's
[352.40 - 354.64] critical because you have to protect
[353.56 - 355.88] your family you have to protect your
[354.64 - 357.08] friends you have to protect your loved
[355.88 - 359.56] ones you got to protect yourself
[357.08 - 361.44] whatever you got to do and the protein
[359.56 - 364.32] machine I call it the protein machine is
[361.44 - 367.48] an evil evil
[364.32 - 369.64] machine it's an evil machine that
[367.48 - 372.80] doesn't that doesn't take hostages it's
[369.64 - 374.84] an it's an evil machine that wants to
[372.80 - 376.12] take people down it sounds crazy well
[374.84 - 379.52] back in the
[376.12 - 381.96] 1930s okay the 1930s a deal was made in
[379.52 - 384.20] the industries a deal you have no idea
[381.96 - 386.04] about a deal that never gets surfaced it
[384.20 - 387.96] never gets talked about and it doesn't
[386.04 - 389.96] even get talked about with with all the
[387.96 - 391.56] different food groups the food Wars you
[389.96 - 393.28] got the Paleo people and the protein
[391.56 - 395.88] eaters here you got the vegans you got
[393.28 - 397.96] the vegetarians here and you got this
[395.88 - 400.40] food War out there and everybody's like
[397.96 - 402.44] trying to throw science reg garbled like
[400.40 - 405.04] junk science just whatever it is just
[402.44 - 407.00] throwing it back and forth you know the
[405.04 - 408.36] Paleo people and the high protein people
[407.00 - 410.64] are all like well you vegans you're
[408.36 - 411.80] going to be starving and you need your
[410.64 - 413.48] protein and where you're going to get
[411.80 - 414.80] your protein and the vegans and the
[413.48 - 416.88] plant-based people are all trying to
[414.80 - 418.20] prove hey we got protein we're throwing
[416.88 - 419.76] and you're eating all the animal meat
[418.20 - 422.12] and that's all bad too and there's this
[419.76 - 425.36] war going on out there and it's pretty
[422.12 - 427.56] intense but everybody's keeping busy and
[425.36 - 429.28] and their eye is on this protein ball
[427.56 - 431.04] and they're passing this protein ball
[429.28 - 432.44] back and forth back and forth some more
[431.04 - 434.60] authors come out and write about the
[432.44 - 436.32] same protein ball back and forth back
[434.60 - 438.68] and forth more experts come out and talk
[436.32 - 440.64] about it on you know whatever TV shows
[438.68 - 443.96] back and forth and guess what you get
[440.64 - 446.52] burned you get burned yeah that's right
[443.96 - 449.52] you get burned and no one knows about
[446.52 - 454.92] the deal and the deals that have been
[449.52 - 458.28] made in the past to make sure protein
[454.92 - 460.48] confuses the crap out of you guys that
[458.28 - 464.32] protein confuses the heck out of you
[460.48 - 466.88] guys so guess what you stay sick that's
[464.32 - 468.64] right and you end up staying sick
[466.88 - 471.48] because the minute you got your eye on
[468.64 - 473.00] the protein ball Hey look it's all about
[471.48 - 475.20] protein look at the back of the package
[473.00 - 477.52] it's protein ignore what what's really
[475.20 - 479.76] in the food ignore what can actually
[477.52 - 481.52] cure your illness because hey no one
[479.76 - 483.00] knows it creates chronic illness anyway
[481.52 - 484.28] so why how would you know unless you
[483.00 - 485.76] read the medical medium books and
[484.28 - 487.24] everything and if you don't then you
[485.76 - 490.36] don't know what causes any disease or
[487.24 - 492.76] illness so there you go and so what
[490.36 - 495.28] happens is we end up just lost in the
[492.76 - 497.72] protein land did you get enough protein
[495.28 - 499.68] oh I'm hungry I must need protein oh my
[497.72 - 501.36] hair's falling out I must need protein
[499.68 - 503.68] oh my Skin's not feeling good looking
[501.36 - 505.48] good I must need protein Oh My Nails oh
[503.68 - 507.68] must be protein your nails aren't strong
[505.48 - 509.88] must be protein oh let's get let's go
[507.68 - 511.36] and get you know let's go to a a and
[509.88 - 512.92] they'll put all the stuff on your face
[511.36 - 514.76] and be like oh it's going to help it's
[512.92 - 517.08] got proteins in it oh let's wrap you up
[514.76 - 519.16] in proteins let's do this let's do that
[517.08 - 520.84] hair shampoo oh there's proteins in this
[519.16 - 523.40] hair shampoo it'll help your hair get
[520.84 - 525.72] thicker it's endless Madness and
[523.40 - 527.48] stupidity you guys wouldn't believe it
[525.72 - 530.04] and yeah I've been staying away from
[527.48 - 532.48] this topic I've been staying away from
[530.04 - 535.44] it there's a reason why because it's
[532.48 - 537.36] that annoying it's so annoying I almost
[535.44 - 541.52] couldn't stand to want to do this but
[537.36 - 544.48] the problem is problem is I have to do
[541.52 - 546.48] this I have to because if you don't have
[544.48 - 548.52] it straight if you don't know what's
[546.48 - 550.56] going on how are you really going to get
[548.52 - 552.52] better when your adrenals are shot how
[550.56 - 553.96] are you really going to get better if
[552.52 - 555.56] you got the chronic fatigue because
[553.96 - 557.56] you're viral how are you going to get
[555.56 - 561.00] better if you got Twitches aches and
[557.56 - 564.96] pain spasms Tremors okay the shakes
[561.00 - 567.84] weakness fatigue fear chaos anxiety
[564.96 - 568.96] depression blurriness brain fog floaters
[567.84 - 570.12] in the eyes how are you going to get
[568.96 - 571.24] better when you don't know anything
[570.12 - 572.60] about those things and you're looking
[571.24 - 574.44] for protein how are you going to get
[572.60 - 576.36] better if you're searching for protein
[574.44 - 579.40] to be your answer when you're walking
[576.36 - 581.56] around sick and you go to a new doctor
[579.40 - 584.28] and I'm not listen I'm not picking on
[581.56 - 585.72] the doctors you know that you know that
[584.28 - 587.32] you know how I am I know a lot of
[585.72 - 589.72] doctors I love doctors that's not the
[587.32 - 591.12] problem is at all it's just unique the
[589.72 - 593.16] doctors can't help what's being taught
[591.12 - 595.92] to them that's all it's as simple as
[593.16 - 598.32] that it's like a whole bad school it's a
[595.92 - 599.76] whole big bad school out there in health
[598.32 - 601.40] and there's everybody goes to it and
[599.76 - 604.48] files in and learns what they learn and
[601.40 - 607.80] what they learn is old old old deals
[604.48 - 611.64] that were made old deals that were made
[607.80 - 615.80] hear me out hear me out okay back in the
[611.64 - 619.08] 1930s all right protein came to town it
[615.80 - 621.32] was like Santa Claus coming to town and
[619.08 - 624.00] this wasn't no friendly nice good Santa
[621.32 - 627.12] Claus this was a Santa Claus with big
[624.00 - 628.80] contracts of tons of paper tons of paper
[627.12 - 630.68] contracts that sit in vaults that you
[628.80 - 633.40] don't even have your hand you couldn't
[630.68 - 636.56] even touch these contracts no way in
[633.40 - 639.60] hell it's called grandfathered contracts
[636.56 - 642.36] in business to make sure protein was
[639.60 - 645.64] literally the focus in every institution
[642.36 - 648.52] school every medical school every single
[645.64 - 651.52] school from elementary school across the
[648.52 - 653.92] country to everywhere possible protein
[651.52 - 655.84] was a new word where did you get your
[653.92 - 657.04] protein if you're going to grow and
[655.84 - 658.36] you're going to drink some milk you're
[657.04 - 660.32] going to get protein out of your milk
[658.36 - 662.00] you're going to grow strong bones and
[660.32 - 663.72] strong muscles so you better get your
[662.00 - 667.84] protein and these deals were made they
[663.72 - 670.44] were slimy greasy disgusting deals that
[667.84 - 672.76] were made in the old day where money was
[670.44 - 675.72] passed from one person to another and it
[672.76 - 678.36] institutionalized as protein being God's
[675.72 - 681.16] answer to everything and you know what
[678.36 - 683.76] else was happening but 1940s early
[681.16 - 685.44] 1940s everybody was filing into doctor's
[683.76 - 687.88] office of sick left and right for the
[685.44 - 690.32] first time in history to this degree
[687.88 - 693.36] where women were find in in like armies
[690.32 - 695.36] of women were coming in with anxiety
[693.36 - 698.36] depression for the first time in the
[695.36 - 700.60] 1940s they were coming in with mystery
[698.36 - 702.64] symptoms like never before I've talked
[700.60 - 705.40] to old doctors I remember in the '90s
[702.64 - 707.76] cuz I was doing this in the 90s and I
[705.40 - 709.68] was doing this in the 80s I was doing
[707.76 - 712.20] this for this is what I had I didn't
[709.68 - 713.64] start this five years ago I didn't start
[712.20 - 715.88] this six years ago oh he's the medical
[713.64 - 717.88] medium what he started 3 years ago no
[715.88 - 719.04] I've been doing this forever since I've
[717.88 - 720.52] been here and I'm going to tell you tell
[719.04 - 722.24] you right now I talked to old doctors in
[720.52 - 724.68] the '90s
[722.24 - 727.96] okay back then and they were in their
[724.68 - 729.40] '90s they had a history of knowing what
[727.96 - 732.24] happened in
[729.40 - 734.32] 1940 okay so if someone says hey what do
[732.24 - 735.84] you know what happened in 1940 Mr Big
[734.32 - 737.68] medical medium I'll tell you I do know
[735.84 - 739.92] what happened in 1940 don't tell me
[737.68 - 742.04] different don't tell me different I do
[739.92 - 743.96] know and I talked to a lot of old
[742.04 - 745.16] doctors in the in back then okay and
[743.96 - 746.68] they said they couldn't believe it it
[745.16 - 750.64] was like they woke up in morning they
[746.68 - 753.48] had their coffee they Dr drove to work
[750.64 - 755.28] okay in their old the old cars the old
[753.48 - 758.28] Buick or whatever they had they drove to
[755.28 - 761.04] work they got there and there was a line
[758.28 - 763.36] at the door it was that fast they said
[761.04 - 765.12] they've never seen anything like it and
[763.36 - 767.12] they only had a couple of fallbacks to
[765.12 - 768.72] go on because when they looked for help
[767.12 - 771.64] from research in science research in
[768.72 - 772.76] science said tell them they need protein
[771.64 - 775.12] tell them maybe they're not getting
[772.76 - 777.52] enough protein if that doesn't work tell
[775.12 - 779.56] them they're crazy and it's all in their
[777.52 - 782.08] head tell all the women they're crazy
[779.56 - 784.56] and it's all in their head and if that
[782.08 - 786.60] doesn't work okay tell them it's
[784.56 - 788.16] hormones because science and research is
[786.60 - 789.44] manufacturing hormones for the first
[788.16 - 791.48] time now we're going to need to sell
[789.44 - 794.12] them you see what I mean we've been
[791.48 - 796.32] duped in so many ways we've been smacked
[794.12 - 798.92] in the heads in so many ways we don't
[796.32 - 801.24] even know we don't even
[798.92 - 804.36] know and meanwhile everybody was coming
[801.24 - 806.88] in due to DDT poison mercury poisoning
[804.36 - 809.28] heavy metal intoxification they're
[806.88 - 810.92] coming in because of Epstein early bar
[809.28 - 812.24] viruses were finally hitting the fan
[810.92 - 813.92] which you got to learn about in thyroid
[812.24 - 815.88] healing you got to read that book front
[813.92 - 819.40] to back to really know about the Epstein
[815.88 - 820.92] bar and and they know it's not out there
[819.40 - 823.44] the information that's out there that's
[820.92 - 825.36] sadly not out there yet and don't get
[823.44 - 828.00] fooled when science when somebody puts
[825.36 - 830.32] out a little thing and they say oh seven
[828.00 - 833.16] seven diseases that that are linked to
[830.32 - 835.00] Epstein bar don't get fooled by that
[833.16 - 838.48] they're just trying to derail you once
[835.00 - 840.96] again it's not linked it's act the EP
[838.48 - 842.96] bar is is the cause of these diseases I
[840.96 - 844.20] talk about all the time don't get fooled
[842.96 - 846.80] by that information that you see
[844.20 - 848.96] floating around that's another to try to
[846.80 - 852.76] derail the progress that we've made you
[848.96 - 855.28] and I have made so what happens with the
[852.76 - 858.32] protein ball everybody's passing that
[855.28 - 860.56] baby around now everybody's passing that
[858.32 - 862.48] around and that thing is still in the
[860.56 - 863.96] way that means that if you're doing
[862.48 - 865.52] something right for yourself you're
[863.96 - 866.76] going to end up doing something wrong
[865.52 - 868.20] for yourself CU you're going to be
[866.76 - 869.56] thinking protein someone's going to tell
[868.20 - 871.80] you did you get enough protein and
[869.56 - 875.08] you're going to derail your
[871.80 - 876.84] process that's how it works that's how
[875.08 - 878.04] it works so let's talk about protein and
[876.84 - 880.36] different light I'm giving you the
[878.04 - 882.04] history of protein with the dirty deals
[880.36 - 883.96] the dirty deals that are made going all
[882.04 - 886.68] the way back the old dirty deals you
[883.96 - 889.96] better believe it going all the way back
[886.68 - 892.04] protein has a nasty business behind it
[889.96 - 895.00] I'm just telling you and a lot of money
[892.04 - 897.68] to be made off of it in the past and a
[895.00 - 901.28] hell of a lot of money is made off of it
[897.68 - 902.60] now because it's an endless topic and no
[901.28 - 904.84] matter you know and I'm not even going
[902.60 - 907.16] to be able to stop it it's like the lime
[904.84 - 908.80] disease thing the truth about Lyme
[907.16 - 911.00] disease I talk about in book one in
[908.80 - 913.16] medical medium book one the truth about
[911.00 - 915.08] lme disease is in there okay about how
[913.16 - 916.80] it was originally viral it is viral it
[915.08 - 918.16] still is viral even though there's some
[916.80 - 919.64] bacteria present and I talk about how
[918.16 - 920.80] the lime labs are all messed up and
[919.64 - 922.40] everything else and I talk about all
[920.80 - 924.48] this stuff like it's all there if you're
[922.40 - 926.24] getting upset and you got Lyme disease
[924.48 - 929.24] just get the book and read it and give
[926.24 - 930.88] it a chance so you can protect yourself
[929.24 - 933.16] but I'm never going to be able to stop
[930.88 - 934.96] the lime train I don't think the lime
[933.16 - 936.64] trap that's out there there's too many
[934.96 - 938.44] Labs too many doctors they're all
[936.64 - 940.64] working together no one knows what's
[938.44 - 942.40] going on and it's just too big and I
[940.64 - 944.12] don't think I can change the course of
[942.40 - 947.56] that one and I don't think I'll ever
[944.12 - 950.28] change the course of the protein mistake
[947.56 - 952.12] either but you know maybe I'm just wrong
[950.28 - 954.32] and maybe we are going to change the
[952.12 - 955.80] course on the protein thing finally
[954.32 - 957.44] maybe it's possible and the same thing
[955.80 - 959.84] with the lime thing possibly I mean we
[957.44 - 961.20] know we've gotten thousands and tens of
[959.84 - 963.48] thousands and tens of thousands of
[961.20 - 965.56] people better with Lyme disease we know
[963.48 - 967.96] that already so maybe we are changing
[965.56 - 970.40] the course but listen to
[967.96 - 972.96] this when it comes down to protein it's
[970.40 - 975.44] so big it's such a big
[972.96 - 977.56] giant that even when you hear the show
[975.44 - 979.56] and you listen to the show and you got
[977.56 - 981.40] the straight you got the straight and
[979.56 - 983.32] narrow you you know what it is you know
[981.40 - 984.60] what's going on about protein you
[983.32 - 986.16] understand what's going on with protein
[984.60 - 988.76] you're still going to bump into a wall
[986.16 - 990.68] possibly because it's that riddled with
[988.76 - 992.72] misinformation out there about protein
[990.68 - 995.00] and there's that much protein fear and
[992.72 - 998.12] there's that much it's in it's literally
[995.00 - 1000.44] passed down a generation now since 1930
[998.12 - 1004.80] and and you can't you can't even you
[1000.44 - 1006.76] can't even get around it and so it's it
[1004.80 - 1008.16] hits everybody it's like when women are
[1006.76 - 1010.00] pregnant is are you getting enough
[1008.16 - 1011.68] protein first of all protein isn't even
[1010.00 - 1013.84] what takes care of the baby when you're
[1011.68 - 1015.12] pregnant it's not even the very thing
[1013.84 - 1016.68] it's minerals it's nutrients
[1015.12 - 1018.56] phytochemicals and food it's
[1016.68 - 1021.44] antioxidants those are the things that
[1018.56 - 1024.16] develop a baby it's carbohydrates that
[1021.44 - 1026.28] develop a baby it's all these other
[1024.16 - 1029.04] things that develop a baby and then the
[1026.28 - 1031.32] baby's liver develops its own protein
[1029.04 - 1033.04] too which is the key see that's the
[1031.32 - 1036.00] whole thing you need all these other
[1033.04 - 1037.72] things in Foods so that your own liver
[1036.00 - 1040.60] which science and research doesn't even
[1037.72 - 1043.56] know about creates your proteins the
[1040.60 - 1046.48] ones that the body accepts as actual
[1043.56 - 1049.60] protein to do the things that science
[1046.48 - 1052.84] theorizes that the body May do with
[1049.60 - 1055.88] protein your liver and by the way Liver
[1052.84 - 1057.52] Rescue is it's on its way it is on its
[1055.88 - 1060.16] way so you got to check that out go to
[1057.52 - 1062.08] Amazon and check it out I did everything
[1060.16 - 1064.44] I did everything for that book I don't
[1062.08 - 1066.68] even know what I didn't do I didn't put
[1064.44 - 1068.96] just the kitchen sink in there I mean I
[1066.68 - 1072.36] put a bathtub in there there's a bathtub
[1068.96 - 1074.72] in that book it's it's it's insane it's
[1072.36 - 1076.96] unbelievable okay so so that's what
[1074.72 - 1078.68] happens so research and science doesn't
[1076.96 - 1080.40] know what the liver does it it just
[1078.68 - 1082.72] doesn't the liver has thousands of
[1080.40 - 1084.64] chemicals chemical functions thousands
[1082.72 - 1086.56] one of them is producing proteins so the
[1084.64 - 1089.08] body can identify those proteins and use
[1086.56 - 1091.60] them that's one thing okay that's where
[1089.08 - 1094.76] we get our proteins the most but eating
[1091.60 - 1097.80] Foods eating foods that heal and feed
[1094.76 - 1100.00] the liver eating foods that take care of
[1097.80 - 1102.36] us that give us all these other things
[1100.00 - 1104.32] can then allow the liver to create
[1102.36 - 1108.00] proteins we need undiscovered proteins
[1104.32 - 1109.20] the liver creates hundreds of proteins
[1108.00 - 1110.88] hundred
[1109.20 - 1113.36] that have the function that function
[1110.88 - 1115.88] that are used for the body to function
[1113.36 - 1117.24] with and it has even nothing to do with
[1115.88 - 1121.40] food or what's in
[1117.24 - 1124.64] food except the right Foods the right
[1121.40 - 1127.12] Foods lots of fruits and vegetables help
[1124.64 - 1130.08] the liver perform its
[1127.12 - 1132.60] functions so see what I mean that's how
[1130.08 - 1134.56] unbel that's how butt backwards we are
[1132.60 - 1136.48] that's how butt backwards we are
[1134.56 - 1138.64] unbelievable and it's even more than
[1136.48 - 1141.88] that there are protein sources in food
[1138.64 - 1143.52] yes and they are helpful they are
[1141.88 - 1144.68] helpful but there's harmful ones too and
[1143.52 - 1145.92] I'm going to cover that so you guys
[1144.68 - 1147.44] we're going to cover that of course you
[1145.92 - 1148.96] know which ones they are I'm sure you
[1147.44 - 1150.88] know so we're going to cover those
[1148.96 - 1153.72] different harmful ones but there's
[1150.88 - 1155.96] helpful ones the proteins and spinach
[1153.72 - 1157.64] really good for us really good just make
[1155.96 - 1160.40] sure it's raw spinach make sure it's not
[1157.64 - 1162.92] cooked it has to be raw spinach it's a
[1160.40 - 1164.44] really high protein Source Nori you know
[1162.92 - 1167.08] when you have your Nori wraps your Nori
[1164.44 - 1168.56] rolls the sushi rolls but the the Nori
[1167.08 - 1170.00] rolls and you put whatever you you put
[1168.56 - 1171.52] avocado in there and you put some
[1170.00 - 1173.60] cucumber in there and some celery and a
[1171.52 - 1176.60] little tomato you wrap it up and you cut
[1173.60 - 1179.08] it in slices and you put it nicely on a
[1176.60 - 1180.40] tray so that's that's something right
[1179.08 - 1182.96] well there's lots of protein in the
[1180.40 - 1185.20] norish sheet and we can't get confused
[1182.96 - 1188.48] protein's not supposed to satiate hunger
[1185.20 - 1190.32] the reason why we look for animal
[1188.48 - 1192.48] proteins and this is an A bash on animal
[1190.32 - 1193.72] protein I'm going to tell you right now
[1192.48 - 1196.32] I'm going to tell you straight up right
[1193.72 - 1198.72] here this isn't propaganda against
[1196.32 - 1202.12] animal the animal protein War world and
[1198.72 - 1205.16] this isn't propaganda against the vegan
[1202.12 - 1207.12] World okay you have to understand this
[1205.16 - 1209.24] for sure because a lot of people even
[1207.12 - 1211.28] when I explain myself like that you
[1209.24 - 1213.32] should see some people are just like oh
[1211.28 - 1215.08] he's just he's he's throwing propaganda
[1213.32 - 1217.76] against the vegans oh he's throwing
[1215.08 - 1220.80] propaganda against the meat eaters no
[1217.76 - 1224.44] I'm not I'm not at all here's how it
[1220.80 - 1226.80] works there's fat that's with protein
[1224.44 - 1229.12] that's how it get satiated so if you're
[1226.80 - 1230.92] a vegan you're eating so many nuts and
[1229.12 - 1232.64] seeds and so many cashews and it's okay
[1230.92 - 1235.16] to eat some nuts and seeds it's okay to
[1232.64 - 1237.28] eat eat some uh pumpkin seeds and some
[1235.16 - 1241.16] flow seeds it's okay to use a little bit
[1237.28 - 1243.96] of olive oil extra virgin olive oil cold
[1241.16 - 1246.88] pressed it's okay and same thing with
[1243.96 - 1248.08] the animal products it's okay if you
[1246.88 - 1249.44] that's what you like and that's what
[1248.08 - 1250.96] you're feeling good and you got no
[1249.44 - 1252.48] problems and your liver's nice and
[1250.96 - 1255.12] strong and you want to eat some animal
[1252.48 - 1258.16] protein of some kind it's okay to have
[1255.12 - 1259.84] some animal protein but remember there's
[1258.16 - 1262.92] fat in these
[1259.84 - 1266.16] proteins and they can't be
[1262.92 - 1267.88] separated so what we get satiated on
[1266.16 - 1272.04] which makes us think we need more and
[1267.88 - 1274.88] more protein is we get satiated on that
[1272.04 - 1276.88] fat content and guess what that fat
[1274.88 - 1280.12] content that's in a ton of nuts will
[1276.88 - 1283.16] kill your liver it will kill your
[1280.12 - 1285.80] liver because you it's that the high fat
[1283.16 - 1289.32] diet is the problem that's the problem
[1285.80 - 1291.52] and no one wants to address that on any
[1289.32 - 1293.28] level the high I'm not talking about the
[1291.52 - 1295.24] trans fatty acids I'm not talking about
[1293.28 - 1297.40] you know some some crazy fast food
[1295.24 - 1299.28] restaurant that's got it's got the fryer
[1297.40 - 1300.84] going with God knows what kind of Grease
[1299.28 - 1303.32] is in that fryer and it's just it's
[1300.84 - 1306.00] rancid and it's just it's bubbling over
[1303.32 - 1307.68] and you frying crap in there and and you
[1306.00 - 1309.72] know and you get pancreatitis from it
[1307.68 - 1311.88] I'm not talking about those bad fats or
[1309.72 - 1314.52] the the bad fats and some cupcake that's
[1311.88 - 1316.24] packaged in some some brand that's
[1314.52 - 1317.72] popular and mainstream that's sitting on
[1316.24 - 1319.68] the shelf in the grocery store and it's
[1317.72 - 1321.72] got all kinds of crazy fats that are in
[1319.68 - 1324.88] there too all hidden and wound up in
[1321.72 - 1327.20] there those are terrible yeah they kill
[1324.88 - 1330.76] the liver yeah they make us sick I'm not
[1327.20 - 1333.00] talking about those no no no no no no
[1330.76 - 1335.52] way I'm talking about what happens when
[1333.00 - 1337.12] you eat too much animal protein too much
[1335.52 - 1339.88] too much you're eating meat for
[1337.12 - 1341.32] breakfast God forbid I mean seriously
[1339.88 - 1342.72] you end up getting your fatty liver you
[1341.32 - 1343.88] get you'll end up with diabetes down the
[1342.72 - 1345.24] road no matter what I don't care how
[1343.88 - 1346.52] much exercise you're doing you'll be
[1345.24 - 1349.04] like at a doctor's office be like your
[1346.52 - 1351.64] A1 C's up you better cut out that one
[1349.04 - 1353.68] apple you eat a day you better that must
[1351.64 - 1355.04] be it it's not all the meat and chicken
[1353.68 - 1356.32] you're eating and it's not all the eggs
[1355.04 - 1358.96] you're eating you better cut out that
[1356.32 - 1360.44] one apple that's how stupid things are I
[1358.96 - 1363.80] have to say that word I can't help it
[1360.44 - 1365.76] it's idiotic here's the thing here's the
[1363.80 - 1367.60] thing okay same thing with the vegans
[1365.76 - 1369.84] doing the plant you guys I know so many
[1367.60 - 1372.00] of you guys are plant-based listen to me
[1369.84 - 1374.92] I I I adore you I totally support it one
[1372.00 - 1376.72] billion percent but I got a lot of
[1374.92 - 1378.84] plant-based people and and they can't
[1376.72 - 1380.56] eat any fruit because they're so busy
[1378.84 - 1381.96] eating so much of the other stuff
[1380.56 - 1383.48] they're eating two avocados three
[1381.96 - 1385.52] avocados a day then they're having a
[1383.48 - 1387.88] whole bunch of nuts and seeds they're
[1385.52 - 1390.28] eating two tablespoons of coconut oil a
[1387.88 - 1392.48] day they're putting in their smoothies a
[1390.28 - 1394.16] whole like almond butter left and right
[1392.48 - 1396.96] and this isn't just the plant-based
[1394.16 - 1400.52] people even the people that are lowering
[1396.96 - 1402.32] animal protein don't eat right so even
[1400.52 - 1404.40] there you know some of the doctors out
[1402.32 - 1407.32] there that are prancing around with new
[1404.40 - 1409.80] ideas saying oh yeah I still eat animal
[1407.32 - 1411.68] protein but you got to lower it and and
[1409.80 - 1413.64] but what you got to do is still focus on
[1411.68 - 1415.32] high fat lots of fats fats are good for
[1413.64 - 1418.28] the brain they're good for the brain no
[1415.32 - 1421.28] they're not terrible for the brain
[1418.28 - 1423.00] terrifying for a brain what's not been
[1421.28 - 1426.48] discovered by research and science is
[1423.00 - 1429.40] people have fatty brains they have fatty
[1426.48 - 1432.28] brains just like fatty liver just like
[1429.40 - 1435.44] fatty liver and that's what kills people
[1432.28 - 1438.36] too that's what kills people too you
[1435.44 - 1441.08] know that expression Fathead yeah it's
[1438.36 - 1443.68] legit it's real no one knows it or
[1441.08 - 1446.36] realizes it but it's real the brain can
[1443.68 - 1450.28] get fatty the brain itself the liver
[1446.36 - 1452.44] gets fatty so even the fancy books that
[1450.28 - 1454.20] are out there now with misinformation
[1452.44 - 1455.44] left and right because of a theory or
[1454.20 - 1457.24] because of a belief system that they're
[1455.44 - 1459.56] going to just shove down your throat
[1457.24 - 1461.12] even those that say oh but no high Fat's
[1459.56 - 1463.44] still great yes you got to start lower
[1461.12 - 1465.32] your animal protein but high fat you
[1463.44 - 1466.80] still want more lots of avocados and you
[1465.32 - 1468.92] want all these all all this almond
[1466.80 - 1470.36] butter straight right into your smoothie
[1468.92 - 1472.04] every morning and you don't want to eat
[1470.36 - 1474.36] too much fruit stay away from those
[1472.04 - 1476.68] sweet fruits it's ridiculous in fact it
[1474.36 - 1478.12] set sends you down to not healing and
[1476.68 - 1479.84] here's the problem if you're working on
[1478.12 - 1481.32] your healing process and you're ebbing
[1479.84 - 1483.56] and flowing because of the natural
[1481.32 - 1485.72] healing process or because your
[1483.56 - 1487.40] supplements that you're on maybe you're
[1485.72 - 1489.00] on the wrong supplements or something or
[1487.40 - 1490.84] maybe whatever and you start taking a
[1489.00 - 1492.96] turn for a second you're going to think
[1490.84 - 1494.80] it's protein you're going to instantly
[1492.96 - 1496.52] blame even if you're on a good diet
[1494.80 - 1498.40] you're going to blame it and that's a
[1496.52 - 1500.08] whole another disaster if you're on a
[1498.40 - 1502.44] good diet you're going to blame that
[1500.08 - 1503.64] good diet as being a protein problem and
[1502.44 - 1505.24] you're going to shuffle around to
[1503.64 - 1507.44] another diet and then to another belief
[1505.24 - 1508.40] system then another ideology another
[1507.44 - 1510.68] you're just going to be moving and
[1508.40 - 1513.12] moving around and cheating yourself at
[1510.68 - 1515.32] getting better classic and I see it all
[1513.12 - 1517.64] the time it's painstaking it's painful
[1515.32 - 1519.64] reason why I put Liver Rescue out there
[1517.64 - 1521.20] is because of this it's just because of
[1519.64 - 1522.56] this reason this is one of the reasons
[1521.20 - 1525.48] you need to know what's going on inside
[1522.56 - 1526.80] the body and what to do including
[1525.48 - 1529.24] supplements and everything around
[1526.80 - 1531.44] supplements so here's the deal okay I'm
[1529.24 - 1533.28] going to be straight up all right if
[1531.44 - 1536.08] you're eating animal protein there's
[1533.28 - 1537.76] some to avoid some you can have that
[1536.08 - 1539.24] won't kill your liver and you got to do
[1537.76 - 1540.56] it in moderation depending on where you
[1539.24 - 1542.80] are with your sickness if you're eating
[1540.56 - 1544.48] plant-based you're eating vegan there's
[1542.80 - 1547.08] there's some nuts and seeds you can have
[1544.48 - 1548.72] some avocado you can have some little
[1547.08 - 1549.96] coconut oil you can have you can also
[1548.72 - 1551.44] have that if you eat meat and you could
[1549.96 - 1554.24] also have that you don't but the point
[1551.44 - 1556.20] is all the fats got to come down a
[1554.24 - 1558.00] little bit you got to make a conscious
[1556.20 - 1561.88] effort to bring them down a little bit
[1558.00 - 1566.36] bit that's the key it has nothing to do
[1561.88 - 1569.04] with protein at all proteins put there
[1566.36 - 1569.80] so you you don't even know how much fat
[1569.04 - 1572.88] you're
[1569.80 - 1575.32] eating that was one of the key things
[1572.88 - 1576.96] because what happened was and just so
[1575.32 - 1578.36] you know the fats the the government
[1576.96 - 1580.20] standards of fats and all this you know
[1578.36 - 1581.64] if you look at the stats on fats how
[1580.20 - 1582.92] much fats are in the food how much fat
[1581.64 - 1584.40] are in a piece of meat how much Fat's in
[1582.92 - 1586.04] a piece of chicken how much Fat's in a
[1584.40 - 1588.12] nuts you know they're all wrong do you
[1586.04 - 1590.68] know they're all wrong every Farm is
[1588.12 - 1593.80] different every single animal is
[1590.68 - 1595.20] different they're completely wrong to
[1593.80 - 1596.92] the degree of how much Fat's and
[1595.20 - 1599.16] everything and everybody knew it at the
[1596.92 - 1601.80] get-go all the way back they got you
[1599.16 - 1604.60] focused on the protein so nobody eats
[1601.80 - 1607.88] healthy enough and the reason why they
[1604.60 - 1610.48] do that is so the industry keeps sick
[1607.88 - 1613.76] people filing in left and right because
[1610.48 - 1616.32] it's a massive trillion trillion dollar
[1613.76 - 1619.60] machine that's grandfathered in with
[1616.32 - 1621.92] contracts and deals made over centuries
[1619.60 - 1624.96] and you guys are all Pawns in the game
[1621.92 - 1627.08] man all Pawns in the game if you play
[1624.96 - 1629.16] with the protein train if you want to
[1627.08 - 1631.12] ride the protein train you're going to
[1629.16 - 1633.52] be part of that whole game I'm not
[1631.12 - 1635.96] trying to rhyme here it's just happening
[1633.52 - 1637.24] naturally okay I'm not a rhyme I'm not a
[1635.96 - 1641.64] good
[1637.24 - 1643.72] rhyme so all right look the bottom line
[1641.64 - 1645.52] is when you think protein you got to
[1643.72 - 1647.24] instantly think of fat that's all think
[1645.52 - 1649.32] of fats okay wait a minute no wait a
[1647.24 - 1652.04] minute fats how much how many fats are
[1649.32 - 1654.64] in my diet and you got to lower them a
[1652.04 - 1658.68] little bit I don't care what illness you
[1654.64 - 1660.96] have what disease what symptom you have
[1658.68 - 1663.96] to lower the fats a little bit if you
[1660.96 - 1666.16] want out I'm giving you a golden ticket
[1663.96 - 1668.32] it's like willly Wonka's you know the
[1666.16 - 1670.08] Chocolate Factory or whatever The Candy
[1668.32 - 1672.00] Factory it's like you're getting the
[1670.08 - 1673.52] golden ticket you're opening up that
[1672.00 - 1674.80] chocolate bar which I don't want you
[1673.52 - 1677.24] really eating too many chocolate bars
[1674.80 - 1678.48] you open up that chocolate bar and then
[1677.24 - 1680.00] gold golden ticket is there and I'm
[1678.48 - 1682.20] trying to hand you that golden ticket
[1680.00 - 1684.00] you can smack me in the face smack it

[1688.60 - 1693.00] been slapped before go ahead just smack
[1690.44 - 1696.72] it out of my hand smack me in the head
[1693.00 - 1699.88] if you want okay but I'm trying to hand
[1696.72 - 1702.84] you I'm trying to to hand you I told you
[1699.88 - 1705.76] I was a little bit a little bit a little
[1702.84 - 1708.00] bit extra excited today you know I'm
[1705.76 - 1709.24] trying to hand you the golden ticket you
[1708.00 - 1711.16] want to call it the Golden Goose of the
[1709.24 - 1713.40] golden egg I'll do that too handing you

[1713.40 - 1719.16] handing you whatever it is you know and
[1716.08 - 1721.20] and it's important it's important
[1719.16 - 1722.64] because it can help you can save you can
[1721.20 - 1724.52] make your life live longer you hear
[1722.64 - 1726.92] about aging aging everybody worried
[1724.52 - 1728.24] about aging I don't want to age I don't
[1726.92 - 1729.60] want to age with 20-year-olds don't
[1728.24 - 1731.28] really care about aging too much you
[1729.60 - 1733.48] they're just too busy with everything
[1731.28 - 1735.20] else right then you hit 30 and you're
[1733.48 - 1737.04] like wait a minute I'm 30 oh I'm out of
[1735.20 - 1738.64] my 20s and you get a little scared right
[1737.04 - 1742.20] and you HS start hitting 40 you're like
[1738.64 - 1743.68] oh my God I'm 40 I'm aging don't want to
[1742.20 - 1745.00] age I don't want to I don't want gray
[1743.68 - 1746.32] hair I don't want to age I don't want
[1745.00 - 1747.60] whatever whatever I don't want my skin
[1746.32 - 1748.64] to go bad I don't want to age I don't
[1747.60 - 1749.72] want to get disease I don't want to
[1748.64 - 1751.28] start breaking down I don't want my
[1749.72 - 1752.52] bones and body to start breaking down my
[1751.28 - 1753.44] muscles breaking down I don't want all
[1752.52 - 1756.96] of that
[1753.44 - 1759.64] happening but it will if you're focused
[1756.96 - 1762.68] on protein it
[1759.64 - 1764.88] will even if you're an athlete and
[1762.68 - 1767.04] you're in your 50s and you're working
[1764.88 - 1769.44] out and you don't seem to have a scrap
[1767.04 - 1771.36] effect on your body if you're focused on
[1769.44 - 1773.88] protein you can set yourself up for a
[1771.36 - 1776.80] heart attack from Hell a heart attack
[1773.88 - 1778.44] from hell I see it all the time I've
[1776.80 - 1781.80] witnessed it all the time I've seen
[1778.44 - 1783.60] people drop dead out there in the world
[1781.80 - 1785.32] I talk to people and they're like I
[1783.60 - 1788.44] can't believe how many people are
[1785.32 - 1790.52] dropping dead joeo is dropping dead this
[1788.44 - 1791.60] other person Saras Su dropped dead
[1790.52 - 1793.24] they're all just they're all just
[1791.60 - 1795.32] dropping dead out there heart attacks
[1793.24 - 1796.76] Galore oh what were they eating I don't
[1795.32 - 1799.24] know they seem to be healthy they were
[1796.76 - 1801.04] exercising they were doing low carb they
[1799.24 - 1803.72] were they were taking care of themselves
[1801.04 - 1807.12] I don't you know the whole bit the whole
[1803.72 - 1808.80] bit now In fairness to the plant-based
[1807.12 - 1811.76] people and fairness to the vegans and
[1808.80 - 1814.00] plant-based people okay there's a double
[1811.76 - 1815.84] standard out there and I feel bad for
[1814.00 - 1818.60] the plant-based people because here's
[1815.84 - 1822.28] the deal all the meat eaters are allowed
[1818.60 - 1823.96] to be sick because guess what out of 330
[1822.28 - 1826.04] million Americans or whatever it is just
[1823.96 - 1827.92] say it's 330 million Americans I I don't
[1826.04 - 1829.76] know the number don't quote me on it
[1827.92 - 1831.72] don't say hey we got him he doesn't even
[1829.76 - 1833.20] know the number of am I'm just saying
[1831.72 - 1836.72] okay I don't quote me on that there's
[1833.20 - 1839.80] three 330 million Americans out of them
[1836.72 - 1843.84] 300 29 million
[1839.80 - 1847.16] 900 whatever okay whatever it is and if
[1843.84 - 1851.60] you want to go percentage you know it's
[1847.16 - 1854.96] 99 something something per meat eaters
[1851.60 - 1856.84] meat eaters okay just letting you know
[1854.96 - 1860.00] and I don't mean meat any kind of animal
[1856.84 - 1861.48] product theaters plant-based people it's
[1860.00 - 1863.84] just a fraction you think there's a lot
[1861.48 - 1866.68] of them no it's a real small just such a
[1863.84 - 1869.16] small amount it's so tiny it's utterly
[1866.68 - 1871.72] ridiculous and if one plant-based person
[1869.16 - 1873.40] one vegan gets sick or has a symptom or
[1871.72 - 1875.68] they're they're wafering back and forth
[1873.40 - 1877.32] with a with a with some kind of problem
[1875.68 - 1878.84] because they have a virus or something
[1877.32 - 1880.84] else that has nothing to do with what
[1878.84 - 1883.40] they're eating and they get they don't
[1880.84 - 1884.68] feel well the meat eating world just
[1883.40 - 1887.28] comes down on them it's a double
[1884.68 - 1888.64] standard but we're not allowed you you
[1887.28 - 1889.92] know what I mean we're not allowed and
[1888.64 - 1891.52] that's the whole thing we shouldn't do
[1889.92 - 1893.84] that we shouldn't be allowed to come
[1891.52 - 1895.04] down on the plant-based people we we
[1893.84 - 1898.00] shouldn't be
[1895.04 - 1900.80] allowed to come down on the on the
[1898.00 - 1902.72] plant-based people the vegan people we
[1900.80 - 1904.60] shouldn't be that we shouldn't we're not
[1902.72 - 1907.28] supposed to be doing that jumping on
[1904.60 - 1909.44] them and we're not allowed to do that
[1907.28 - 1911.84] the thing is is the vegans they're not
[1909.44 - 1913.88] allowed to jump on the the the animal
[1911.84 - 1916.72] protein people when they get sick
[1913.88 - 1918.88] they're not they're not and you know but
[1916.72 - 1920.76] the thing is is the animal people the
[1918.88 - 1922.32] animal protein people they jump on them
[1920.76 - 1923.84] they SC they they try to crush the
[1922.32 - 1925.40] vegans and the plant-based people oh
[1923.84 - 1927.60] it's because you're not getting protein
[1925.40 - 1930.48] oh it's and I got to say all fairness
[1927.60 - 1932.36] that's terrible that's terrible because
[1930.48 - 1935.20] there isn't any vegans really it's a
[1932.36 - 1936.68] small crew and vegans are only vegans
[1935.20 - 1938.80] for a little while they're not vegans
[1936.68 - 1940.16] for 30 40 years I mean they maybe people
[1938.80 - 1941.80] are vegan for a month and then they're
[1940.16 - 1944.04] off of it maybe people are vegan for a
[1941.80 - 1946.52] year they're off of it there's not many
[1944.04 - 1948.84] so you can't they can't be judged in all
[1946.52 - 1953.32] fairness that's uncool it's uncool to be
[1948.84 - 1957.84] judging that when there's or
[1953.32 - 1959.88] 329 million animal protein of some sort
[1957.84 - 1962.64] some kind of animal protein
[1959.88 - 1964.36] eaters and what about all the sickness
[1962.64 - 1965.92] that's the majority of the country and
[1964.36 - 1968.92] and they're all sick out of the when I
[1965.92 - 1971.24] say there's 250 million Americans that
[1968.92 - 1972.80] are sick that and there is I'm telling
[1971.24 - 1975.68] you right now don't get confused by
[1972.80 - 1977.04] television don't get confused by TV
[1975.68 - 1978.88] because you see some people that look
[1977.04 - 1980.36] look healthy on TV because they're hired
[1978.88 - 1982.80] for a commercial or whatever it is don't
[1980.36 - 1984.28] get confused by that there's over 250
[1982.80 - 1986.80] million sick
[1984.28 - 1988.80] Americans and you know how you got to
[1986.80 - 1991.44] understand it's all the animal protein
[1988.80 - 1994.48] years but I'm not just saying that's why
[1991.44 - 1997.00] they're sick I'm saying and that's where
[1994.48 - 2000.40] we have to clear this up right now I'm
[1997.00 - 2003.12] saying it's because of the high fat diet
[2000.40 - 2005.56] the high fat diets the too much fat in
[2003.12 - 2007.16] the diets it's not about the animal
[2005.56 - 2009.32] protein really in the end it's it's
[2007.16 - 2011.64] about the fat and in the vegans when
[2009.32 - 2013.80] vegans get sick they're on way too much
[2011.64 - 2015.44] fat too so the small amount of vegans
[2013.80 - 2016.76] it's a small crew it's a really small
[2015.44 - 2019.28] crew out there you don't think it is
[2016.76 - 2022.44] it's small believe me and that small
[2019.28 - 2024.72] crew they they they're on high fat diets
[2022.44 - 2027.80] too and they get
[2024.72 - 2029.32] sick and there's both sides are looking
[2027.80 - 2032.72] for
[2029.32 - 2034.24] protein that's what I'm trying to say so
[2032.72 - 2035.80] you got to be really careful you got to
[2034.24 - 2037.84] lower the fats what does that mean if
[2035.80 - 2040.48] you're plant-based you got to keep the
[2037.84 - 2042.68] avocados where it's like one a day you
[2040.48 - 2044.24] know maybe even a half of avocado a day
[2042.68 - 2046.36] maybe it's a handful of nuts and seeds
[2044.24 - 2048.20] in between and the rest lots of fruits
[2046.36 - 2049.52] salads if you're if you're you know if
[2048.20 - 2052.00] you do some cooked food you can do
[2049.52 - 2053.84] potatoes sweet potatoes winter squash
[2052.00 - 2055.88] you can do all that if you're raw you do
[2053.84 - 2057.20] lot extra bananas and dates with salads
[2055.88 - 2058.52] and greens and you make sure you get
[2057.20 - 2060.20] your celery juice in we're going to talk
[2058.52 - 2062.32] about rebuilding muscle too so just hang
[2060.20 - 2063.72] in there for this ride hang in there
[2062.32 - 2066.20] okay I hope this show is interesting
[2063.72 - 2068.20] enough I hope it's interesting enough
[2066.20 - 2071.12] cuz I I want you guys to know all this
[2068.20 - 2072.76] stuff okay and if you're doing animal
[2071.12 - 2075.48] protein you got to bring you can't be
[2072.76 - 2079.00] eating meat three times a day I've never
[2075.48 - 2081.64] seen anything good ever come out of in
[2079.00 - 2084.36] all my years and I'm not anti-animal
[2081.64 - 2086.60] product person and all I'm telling you
[2084.36 - 2090.96] right now I'm not one and I've never
[2086.60 - 2092.76] seen anything good I swear to God out of
[2090.96 - 2095.20] out of eating animal protein of some
[2092.76 - 2098.04] kind three times a day never seen
[2095.20 - 2101.44] anything good come out of it it I I'm
[2098.04 - 2103.72] telling you right now ever ever and if
[2101.44 - 2105.44] you say someone lived to be 85 and ate
[2103.72 - 2108.20] animal products three times a day they
[2105.44 - 2112.04] would have lived to be 118 then if they
[2108.20 - 2114.52] didn't because the fat shortened them to
[2112.04 - 2117.20] 85 and when it comes down to diseases
[2114.52 - 2120.00] the very re real causes of illness and
[2117.20 - 2123.24] disease that I outline in my books you
[2120.00 - 2125.88] guys outline in the books which is all
[2123.24 - 2129.64] the viruses which is all the heavy
[2125.88 - 2132.88] metals you can't get heavy metals out of
[2129.64 - 2134.96] the body in its entirety if your fats in
[2132.88 - 2137.40] your diet are too high both animal
[2134.96 - 2140.84] protein side and both vegan side and
[2137.40 - 2144.48] plant-based side okay you can't get the
[2140.84 - 2147.68] heavy metals out of the body you can't
[2144.48 - 2150.60] get the viruses out of the body easily
[2147.68 - 2152.48] if your fats are too high and that means
[2150.60 - 2155.24] you're searching for protein and getting
[2152.48 - 2157.20] yourself in trouble with fat how many
[2155.24 - 2158.76] shows like doctor shows where another
[2157.20 - 2160.76] guy comes on he's like here's how you do
[2158.76 - 2162.48] your smoothie you put your almond butter
[2160.76 - 2165.40] in there and you throw this and you
[2162.48 - 2167.92] throw your just a few blueberries in
[2165.40 - 2169.40] there a few cultivated blueberries in
[2167.92 - 2170.84] there and you put those in there and
[2169.40 - 2172.84] you're just like and you're blending up
[2170.84 - 2174.36] this big fat smoothie right on one of
[2172.84 - 2175.96] the doctor show and you're just like
[2174.36 - 2178.24] okay let's keep on teaching people to
[2175.96 - 2179.92] eat nice and lots of fats and then then
[2178.24 - 2182.12] you come across and you show the table
[2179.92 - 2184.04] it's like ban Meats oh which is all fat
[2182.12 - 2186.60] still all fat when you think oh whole
[2184.04 - 2188.00] lean proteins it's all fats or say it's
[2186.60 - 2190.12] a different person coming up on some
[2188.00 - 2191.64] weird doctor show and it's like oh let's
[2190.12 - 2193.40] lots of nuts and see coconut oil should
[2191.64 - 2195.84] be doing two tablespoons of coconut oil
[2193.40 - 2196.96] and lots of tahini and everything else
[2195.84 - 2198.24] because whoa you're going to need lots
[2196.96 - 2200.28] of HEI for your protein and you're going
[2198.24 - 2202.08] to be all these protein Powers all the
[2200.28 - 2204.04] the different protein powers and you're
[2202.08 - 2205.00] going to get in trouble you're going to
[2204.04 - 2207.12] get in
[2205.00 - 2210.16] trouble because what's really happening
[2207.12 - 2211.88] is we got viruses eating people up all
[2210.16 - 2213.20] the symptoms I mentioned ear early on
[2211.88 - 2216.32] all the symptoms and all the diseases
[2213.20 - 2217.88] Hashimoto thyroiditis multiple sclerosis
[2216.32 - 2219.36] this go goes on and on and on these are
[2217.88 - 2221.24] just a couple of things that I randomly
[2219.36 - 2222.68] mention all the time lupus whatever and
[2221.24 - 2224.56] all of them there's but tons and tons
[2222.68 - 2227.24] and tons of autoimmune conditions eximus
[2224.56 - 2229.80] Rises everything else all of it from all
[2227.24 - 2232.04] the different UTI from all the different
[2229.80 - 2234.24] migraines to everything under the sun
[2232.04 - 2237.80] there's pathogens and metals behind it
[2234.24 - 2241.04] and it has nothing to do with protein
[2237.80 - 2243.88] God Almighty it has nothing to do with
[2241.04 - 2246.24] protein that's how demented this joke
[2243.88 - 2249.08] has gone too far and how demented this
[2246.24 - 2252.16] joke is is and how far it's gone does
[2249.08 - 2254.20] anyone know how far it's gone it is
[2252.16 - 2257.28] disgusting and I'm telling you right now
[2254.20 - 2260.00] it's not over I could sit here and rant
[2257.28 - 2262.64] all I want on a soap box I could be like
[2260.00 - 2264.44] okay step right up and just come on
[2262.64 - 2266.12] here's a Golden Ticket of Truth take the
[2264.44 - 2267.44] golden ticket of Truth and still
[2266.12 - 2268.68] someone's going to smack it out of my
[2267.44 - 2271.44] hand because you know what I can't
[2268.68 - 2272.52] control the world haven't you realized
[2271.44 - 2273.92] that too that you can't control the
[2272.52 - 2275.96] world but you know what we can do we can
[2273.92 - 2277.64] change the people around us and the
[2275.96 - 2279.68] people we meet and we can change
[2277.64 - 2282.44] ourselves and we can heal and help heal
[2279.68 - 2286.20] others and you know what you know what
[2282.44 - 2290.28] you save one person one person and that
[2286.20 - 2294.28] is their world that is their world
[2290.28 - 2298.56] remember that that is their world you
[2294.28 - 2299.96] save one person from misinformation and
[2298.56 - 2301.52] stupidity out there in the in the
[2299.96 - 2303.88] industries alternative and conventional
[2301.52 - 2306.96] you save one person and you save one
[2303.88 - 2309.04] child you save one Grandma you save one
[2306.96 - 2312.68] person you just save their world
[2309.04 - 2315.00] regardless of how idiotic the world can
[2312.68 - 2316.60] be that you can't control and that's the
[2315.00 - 2317.92] power of what we're doing and that's the
[2316.60 - 2320.00] power of what you're doing and that's
[2317.92 - 2322.08] the power that's what it all
[2320.00 - 2323.76] is so there's all these things that
[2322.08 - 2325.92] create disease and illness and symptoms
[2323.76 - 2327.72] and nobody cares nobody knows anything
[2325.92 - 2330.00] about and the ones that do care say you
[2327.72 - 2335.04] need more protein to fix it you believe
[2330.00 - 2337.24] that do you believe that yes it's still
[2335.04 - 2338.80] going on you walk in into the best
[2337.24 - 2340.40] functional doctor and I love all the
[2338.80 - 2342.72] functional doctors but you walk into
[2340.40 - 2345.80] them and and oh I probably need new Pro
[2342.72 - 2348.28] more protein and it's not their fault
[2345.80 - 2350.24] God bless them because they're still
[2348.28 - 2352.92] helping people in different ways all our
[2350.24 - 2355.64] doctors do every last one of them still
[2352.92 - 2357.72] help us in every way and they have
[2355.64 - 2358.84] compassion and they care that's why they
[2357.72 - 2360.16] woke up in the morning and said I'm
[2358.84 - 2361.96] going to go to medical school I'm going
[2360.16 - 2364.12] to go and torture myself through that
[2361.96 - 2366.96] whole process and then sit in an office
[2364.12 - 2369.76] somewhere why people file in when I
[2366.96 - 2373.88] could be doing something else with my
[2369.76 - 2375.96] life because they care because they care
[2373.88 - 2379.52] so that's why it's a big deal but what
[2375.96 - 2382.12] happens is we get thrown the wrong wrong
[2379.52 - 2383.64] place down the we get thrown into like
[2382.12 - 2385.72] hey a protein fear it's all about
[2383.64 - 2388.28] protein fruit's bad fruit fear it's all
[2385.72 - 2390.56] about fruit oh you know it's it's all
[2388.28 - 2392.32] LEC in fear now LEC in fear listen to my
[2390.56 - 2395.40] lectin show you got to list listen to my
[2392.32 - 2398.40] lectin show you got to listen to it
[2395.40 - 2400.88] unbelievable talking about crap people
[2398.40 - 2403.20] are trying to H hang their hat on why do
[2400.88 - 2406.64] I get upset about this because it
[2403.20 - 2408.44] hinders your healing it slows down your
[2406.64 - 2409.88] healing it's going to mess you up so
[2408.44 - 2411.20] what do you eat what do you do how do
[2409.88 - 2412.40] you eat I'm sure all these questions are
[2411.20 - 2414.16] coming through first of all there's
[2412.40 - 2416.36] plenty of protein you can't stay away
[2414.16 - 2418.60] from it it's in everything you can't you
[2416.36 - 2420.24] eat a potato and the bioavailable
[2418.60 - 2422.96] protein just in the skin alone and
[2420.24 - 2424.52] inside the potato itself is more healing
[2422.96 - 2426.88] than some of the pro all the proteins
[2424.52 - 2429.64] out there in the world but potatoes are
[2426.88 - 2432.12] shunned that's what I'm talking about
[2429.64 - 2434.36] there's there's protein and tomatoes
[2432.12 - 2435.88] proteins that people don't understand
[2434.36 - 2437.84] yet that science and research don't
[2435.88 - 2440.08] understand because what they confuse you
[2437.84 - 2442.44] with purposely is the dirty deals went
[2440.08 - 2444.52] on in the 30s and the 1940s that were
[2442.44 - 2446.52] married to right now and don't even know
[2444.52 - 2448.64] we don't even know what we're married to
[2446.52 - 2451.16] that's how sick it is and this is the
[2448.64 - 2453.08] deal and these and these grandfather
[2451.16 - 2455.12] laws that we're attached to that we have
[2453.08 - 2457.64] no idea what they are they're geared so
[2455.12 - 2459.44] we get confused that we think satiation
[2457.64 - 2461.76] has something to do with protein it has
[2459.44 - 2464.32] nothing to do with protein satiation
[2461.76 - 2466.92] satiation has everything to do with
[2464.32 - 2470.52] carbohydrate with calories and that part
[2466.92 - 2473.88] is right it's calories satiate also
[2470.52 - 2478.12] mineral salts satiate mineral salts and
[2473.88 - 2481.60] calories satiate hear me out glucose
[2478.12 - 2482.72] carbohydrate mineral salts satiate
[2481.60 - 2485.24] that's what
[2482.72 - 2488.00] satiates that's what that's what takes
[2485.24 - 2492.20] care of hunger but they purposely
[2488.00 - 2494.84] poisoned the water so that you think fat
[2492.20 - 2496.56] that fat protein that protein satiates
[2494.84 - 2498.76] because proteins are always they always
[2496.56 - 2502.52] got fat involved with them and they
[2498.76 - 2504.44] satiate and then we get confused it has
[2502.52 - 2506.60] nothing to do with that and then they
[2504.44 - 2510.44] throw away your potatoes they throw away
[2506.60 - 2512.72] your tomatoes with hip trendy crap that
[2510.44 - 2514.80] circulates just when we make progress
[2512.72 - 2516.56] they throw away your fruit we finally
[2514.80 - 2518.60] make progress that fruit fruit is
[2516.56 - 2521.52] healing people and it really is and they
[2518.60 - 2524.64] throw at another trendy person paid for
[2521.52 - 2526.56] by God knows what fruit fear and do you
[2524.64 - 2528.48] know all got got people that are they're
[2526.56 - 2530.16] not even paid off they're just following
[2528.48 - 2532.72] other people that were paid off 20 years
[2530.16 - 2534.56] ago that were the that were the plants
[2532.72 - 2536.20] that were the moles and they were put
[2534.56 - 2538.44] into the system alternatively and
[2536.20 - 2540.56] conventionally so so fruit fear went
[2538.44 - 2542.72] down the line so that people who aren't
[2540.56 - 2544.40] paid off go and write a book about you
[2542.72 - 2546.32] know stay away from all that Sugar stay
[2544.40 - 2548.28] away from all those fruits you got got
[2546.32 - 2552.28] to be on your protein it's
[2548.28 - 2556.56] unbelievable what's going on out
[2552.28 - 2558.80] there yeah take a sigh take a sigh so
[2556.56 - 2561.92] what can you eat you just can't you can
[2558.80 - 2564.16] eat lots of things but you can't think
[2561.92 - 2565.52] about protein as you're eating you're
[2564.16 - 2566.28] going to get in trouble there's protein
[2565.52 - 2569.04] and
[2566.28 - 2572.56] bananas for God's sake there's protein
[2569.04 - 2574.24] and bananas and a b bananas satiate they
[2572.56 - 2575.80] satiate because of because of the
[2574.24 - 2577.44] calories coming from the carbohydrate
[2575.80 - 2579.12] and banana which is really healing which
[2577.44 - 2581.80] actually kills viruses and bacteria in
[2579.12 - 2585.44] the gut which actually heals Celiac
[2581.80 - 2587.64] Celiac it heals IBS bananas heal Crohn's
[2585.44 - 2589.52] and Colitis I've had the worst Crohn's
[2587.64 - 2591.44] cases ever out there and I've dealt with
[2589.52 - 2593.04] them and I've gotten people to to avoid
[2591.44 - 2595.68] surgeries and everything else Under the
[2593.04 - 2598.84] Sun with silly
[2595.68 - 2602.44] bananas bananas even repel retroviruses
[2598.84 - 2605.20] like HIV bananas repel herpetic virus
[2602.44 - 2606.60] like all the H all the hhv sixs and
[2605.20 - 2608.76] sevens and eights and
[2606.60 - 2610.72] undiscovered and in the nines and the 10
[2608.76 - 2612.52] and 11s and 12 14s and 15s that are
[2610.72 - 2614.84] undiscovered by research in science and
[2612.52 - 2616.36] so many herpetic mutations over 60
[2614.84 - 2618.04] varieties of Epstein bar I talk about
[2616.36 - 2619.16] all my books if you don't have my books
[2618.04 - 2621.08] got to get the books because I don't
[2619.16 - 2623.60] cover all that in these shows there's no
[2621.08 - 2625.32] way I can there's no way I can if you
[2623.60 - 2626.60] read it once read the book again you'll
[2625.32 - 2630.40] you'll realize there's a whole bunch of
[2626.60 - 2632.36] stuff you missed and and and the deal is
[2630.40 - 2635.24] is that you know everything's got
[2632.36 - 2637.04] proteins everything oranges have some
[2635.24 - 2639.00] protein apples have have protein and
[2637.04 - 2641.00] they're all proteins yeah they got them
[2639.00 - 2644.04] in there and they do play some role in
[2641.00 - 2645.56] the body but what really plays a role is
[2644.04 - 2647.36] keeping your liver healthy so your liver
[2645.56 - 2649.32] can create all the proteins you need
[2647.36 - 2652.04] that's the whole point a dying liver you
[2649.32 - 2654.52] age you bombard your liver with loads of
[2652.04 - 2657.08] fat you bombard your brain with loads of
[2654.52 - 2659.24] fat and you age oh so you hear about
[2657.08 - 2660.96] science that there's fats oh the megas
[2659.24 - 2662.56] are good for the brain that fats are
[2660.96 - 2665.08] everything for the brain that's what you
[2662.56 - 2667.80] heard let me tell you something there's
[2665.08 - 2670.52] a micros opic percentage of fat in the
[2667.80 - 2673.28] brain the rest is made out of glycogen
[2670.52 - 2675.16] storage hardened which is which is
[2673.28 - 2678.28] actually a positive thing with this
[2675.16 - 2680.92] because it's hardened glycogen that's
[2678.28 - 2683.12] how our brains stop atrophying and stay
[2680.92 - 2684.72] alive and stay vibrant and don't shrink
[2683.12 - 2688.16] when we get older it's from
[2684.72 - 2690.84] carbohydrates from stored glucose in the
[2688.16 - 2695.04] form of glycogen the brain is this
[2690.84 - 2698.56] jellyfish of sugar with very low traces
[2695.04 - 2700.32] of Omega so low and small without
[2698.56 - 2702.40] because the more fat in the brain the
[2700.32 - 2704.92] more the more Metals will stay in the
[2702.40 - 2707.48] brain the more fat in the brain the more
[2704.92 - 2709.32] the more viruses can breed in the brain
[2707.48 - 2710.96] the more the more trouble the more
[2709.32 - 2712.40] calcifications crystallizations in the
[2710.96 - 2714.44] brain black spots white spots on the
[2712.40 - 2715.44] brain lesions on the brain you name it
[2714.44 - 2718.48] can
[2715.44 - 2720.72] develop all of that with fatty brain
[2718.48 - 2723.20] that's right you heard it here first you
[2720.72 - 2724.88] heard it here first bet a whole bunch of
[2723.20 - 2726.88] copycats out there in the book world are
[2724.88 - 2728.20] going to want to come out with all this
[2726.88 - 2729.60] stuff when you know the whole thing when
[2728.20 - 2731.16] medical medium's putting out this liver
[2729.60 - 2732.92] book to try to make sure that you guys
[2731.16 - 2734.16] heal in every way in every capacity you
[2732.92 - 2735.32] better believe a whole bunch of people
[2734.16 - 2738.52] are going to try to counter it with
[2735.32 - 2739.56] their their idea of what they think the
[2738.52 - 2741.60] liver
[2739.56 - 2743.08] does and they'll and you know what one
[2741.60 - 2744.80] of those ideas is I'm going to tell you
[2743.08 - 2746.28] right now the industries both
[2744.80 - 2747.84] alternative and conventional think that
[2746.28 - 2751.76] Fat's good for your liver even though
[2747.84 - 2753.68] fatty liver is caused by Fats is that
[2751.76 - 2755.16] amazing the industries right now
[2753.68 - 2758.16] alternative and conventional believe
[2755.16 - 2759.80] that sugar is bad for your liver and I'm
[2758.16 - 2761.40] not talking about table sugar that's not
[2759.80 - 2763.08] good for anybody and there's a reason it
[2761.40 - 2765.00] was separated in such a way I'm talking
[2763.08 - 2767.12] about the sugar that's naturally derived
[2765.00 - 2769.12] but it's naturally sitting in all the
[2767.12 - 2772.76] fruits and here's the thing you want to
[2769.12 - 2774.64] build muscle it's not built on protein
[2772.76 - 2777.68] muscle's not built on protein muscle's
[2774.64 - 2779.52] built on three things hear me out here's
[2777.68 - 2781.48] your golden ticket giving you the golden
[2779.52 - 2784.28] ticket do you want it three things
[2781.48 - 2786.56] muscle is built on mineral salts that's
[2784.28 - 2788.04] one thing mineral salts lots of celery
[2786.56 - 2789.52] juice whether you're working out whether
[2788.04 - 2792.28] you're an athlete whether you're sick in
[2789.52 - 2794.64] bed atrophying because you're so sick
[2792.28 - 2796.68] you better stop the atrophying by using
[2794.64 - 2799.44] celery juice mineral salts stop the
[2796.68 - 2801.88] muscles from atrophying they also remove
[2799.44 - 2804.32] the toxins in the way from the muscle
[2801.88 - 2806.08] cell expanding and building so your
[2804.32 - 2808.32] muscle tissue can build when you get
[2806.08 - 2811.36] mineral salts in your muscles which is
[2808.32 - 2813.76] celery juice and then you guys and then
[2811.36 - 2816.72] the second thing the second thing which
[2813.76 - 2819.64] is critical is carbohydrates not fats
[2816.72 - 2821.88] not proteins carbohydrates fats stop you
[2819.64 - 2826.20] from building muscle they stop you from
[2821.88 - 2828.52] building muscle they do they do
[2826.20 - 2831.24] carbohydrates carbohydrates that's what
[2828.52 - 2834.76] builds muscle because guess what muscle
[2831.24 - 2838.88] cells can only be built on glucose
[2834.76 - 2841.32] entering into it with a nutrient because
[2838.88 - 2843.44] glucose attaches to all nutrients when
[2841.32 - 2845.12] you eat a banana the glucose from banana
[2843.44 - 2848.04] attaches to all nutrients to drive it
[2845.12 - 2849.48] into the muscle to build a muscle okay
[2848.04 - 2851.48] that's the second thing and I'm being
[2849.48 - 2854.48] light on this there's more I could add
[2851.48 - 2855.84] the third thing is using your muscle so
[2854.48 - 2857.40] if you're sick and chronically ill in
[2855.84 - 2859.20] bed and all you can do is lift up a
[2857.40 - 2861.24] glass you're building muscle by lifting
[2859.20 - 2863.52] up a glass if you're getting enough of
[2861.24 - 2865.00] the fruit in you enough of the potato in
[2863.52 - 2866.64] you things that have the carbohydrate
[2865.00 - 2868.16] and you're lowering your fats you know
[2866.64 - 2869.92] what gets people chronically ill really
[2868.16 - 2871.04] in trouble when they're in bed and all
[2869.92 - 2872.48] their doctors and all their family
[2871.04 - 2874.00] members like they need protein they're
[2872.48 - 2875.48] waing away they're atrophying they're
[2874.00 - 2876.56] sick in bed nobody knows what's wrong
[2875.48 - 2878.00] with them come on maybe they got Lyme
[2876.56 - 2880.04] disease maybe they got this maybe they
[2878.00 - 2882.44] got that maybe got Ms whatever it is but
[2880.04 - 2884.12] they're viral as heck and they're loaded
[2882.44 - 2886.20] with viruses they're suffering the poor
[2884.12 - 2888.04] things I've seen it for years it's
[2886.20 - 2890.20] horrible and you know and then they're
[2888.04 - 2892.36] being thrown fat diets lots of protein
[2890.20 - 2894.36] and fat being thrown in them atrophying
[2892.36 - 2896.08] them when they need to be getting on
[2894.36 - 2897.96] some bananas they need to be getting on
[2896.08 - 2901.40] potatoes they need to be getting on
[2897.96 - 2904.68] maybe some steamed peas steamed
[2901.40 - 2906.68] peas okay that's what I'm talking about
[2904.68 - 2908.20] those are the things that matter and you
[2906.68 - 2909.44] know why protein powders now the P
[2908.20 - 2911.28] protein powders you know why
[2909.44 - 2913.08] bodybuilders that eat animal protein but
[2911.28 - 2914.76] they hop on a p protein powder that's
[2913.08 - 2917.36] actually a carbohydrate in there that's
[2914.76 - 2918.60] what gives you muscle and you know those
[2917.36 - 2920.04] you know those other you know there's
[2918.60 - 2921.84] other there's people that say wait a
[2920.04 - 2923.48] minute if muscle doesn't get built on
[2921.84 - 2925.08] protein I'm on an all protein diet I'm
[2923.48 - 2926.16] on no carbohydrates how come I'm
[2925.08 - 2927.92] building muscle that's because they are
[2926.16 - 2929.84] on carbohydrates they're in the protein
[2927.92 - 2930.96] shakes and powders they's SE sugars in
[2929.84 - 2932.64] them they're hidden in there that's how
[2930.96 - 2934.60] they do it they have to put sugar in
[2932.64 - 2939.28] these protein powders I know this for a
[2934.60 - 2941.88] fact I know this for a fact they have to
[2939.28 - 2944.56] if they don't you're going to hit the
[2941.88 - 2946.44] wall you're going to hit the wall it's
[2944.56 - 2948.32] critical and and I'll tell you right now
[2946.44 - 2949.80] the one apple you do eat every 3 days if
[2948.32 - 2951.32] you're on a low carb diet and a high
[2949.80 - 2952.96] protein diet the one apple you eat every
[2951.32 - 2954.72] 3 days is going to actually be what your
[2952.96 - 2956.36] muscles are sucking up and absorbing so
[2954.72 - 2958.44] you can build a
[2956.36 - 2960.76] muscle and then you use your muscle you
[2958.44 - 2962.92] build a muscle don't think about how
[2960.76 - 2964.32] many protein grams you need a day how
[2962.92 - 2965.28] many grams of protein you need a day
[2964.32 - 2966.60] you're just going to get yourself in
[2965.28 - 2967.76] trouble you're going to walk into walls
[2966.60 - 2970.08] you're going to step on potholes and
[2967.76 - 2971.56] you're going to get yourself in trouble
[2970.08 - 2972.84] you just got to be eating enough fruits
[2971.56 - 2974.44] and vegetables and you got to make sure
[2972.84 - 2975.48] you're lowering your you're if you're
[2974.44 - 2977.20] okay let's let's hit it if you're
[2975.48 - 2978.96] hitting if you're doing animal proteins
[2977.20 - 2980.76] do it once a day if you love animal
[2978.96 - 2982.52] proteins do it once a day that's right
[2980.76 - 2985.68] you're hearing it from me do it once a
[2982.52 - 2987.00] day do your salmon once a day absolutely
[2985.68 - 2988.24] if you like your grass-fed beef and
[2987.00 - 2989.96] that's what you really feel good on do
[2988.24 - 2991.68] it once a day the reason why people feel
[2989.96 - 2993.72] like they need a protein a lot of times
[2991.68 - 2995.96] too is if they're only eating salads
[2993.72 - 2997.28] with not enough carbohydrates in them or
[2995.96 - 2998.60] not enough calories in them they're
[2997.28 - 2999.88] eating some salads and they're eating a
[2998.60 - 3001.44] little piece of fruit here and there and
[2999.88 - 3002.80] they're on this like diet or they're on
[3001.44 - 3003.72] the cleanse which is amazing to help
[3002.80 - 3005.52] them heal they'll feel like they're
[3003.72 - 3007.28] hitting the wall and they need 4 oz
[3005.52 - 3009.00] steak or 4 oz piece of chicken or a 10
[3007.28 - 3010.84] oz piece of chicken because they're
[3009.00 - 3013.08] looking for calories and chicken has
[3010.84 - 3015.36] it's so high in calories the protein
[3013.08 - 3019.12] isn't what fills you up or satiates you
[3015.36 - 3021.48] I said it earlier it's the
[3019.12 - 3022.92] calories it then that's what does it so
[3021.48 - 3025.12] you have to bring your potatoes in your
[3022.92 - 3027.08] sweet potatoes your winter squash you
[3025.12 - 3028.76] have to start your your steamed brussel
[3027.08 - 3031.36] sprouts you got to start bringing in
[3028.76 - 3033.04] some some dense calories and you got to
[3031.36 - 3034.48] be doing your spinach soups you got to
[3033.04 - 3036.12] throw your spinach you know I talk about
[3034.48 - 3037.84] medical median book one into the blender
[3036.12 - 3039.72] and blend it up with some tomatoes and
[3037.84 - 3041.16] you make yourself a nice rich spinach
[3039.72 - 3042.72] soup and you got to be eating enough
[3041.16 - 3044.24] fruit you got to get your papay out you
[3042.72 - 3047.44] got to get your you eat a few bananas
[3044.24 - 3049.56] and a few dates you'll get satiated and
[3047.44 - 3051.40] you'll be able to heal if you're eating
[3049.56 - 3052.76] animal protein go to one Ser if you're a
[3051.40 - 3054.72] big animal protein person go to one
[3052.76 - 3056.52] serving a day if you're a big vegan big
[3054.72 - 3059.20] into IND plant-based and that's your
[3056.52 - 3061.24] whole thing absolutely I support it go
[3059.20 - 3063.04] down drop your nuts and seeds in your
[3061.24 - 3064.32] oils though bring them down have a
[3063.04 - 3065.80] handful here and there and make sure you
[3064.32 - 3067.76] get a lot more of the fresh fruits and
[3065.80 - 3069.56] vegetables do melon in the morning gets
[3067.76 - 3072.96] lots of celery juice but both sides of
[3069.56 - 3076.00] the aisle I swear to God both sides of
[3072.96 - 3077.88] the aisle are so busy battling over the
[3076.00 - 3079.16] protein war and really honestly the
[3077.88 - 3080.60] plant-based people and the vegan people
[3079.16 - 3083.80] they're taking the fall they take the
[3080.60 - 3085.40] hit because there's not a lot of them so
[3083.80 - 3087.40] as they're healing and reversing their
[3085.40 - 3089.12] diseases and changing people's lives get
[3087.40 - 3091.08] a whole bunch of angry I mean it's a
[3089.12 - 3093.24] double standard in that it's
[3091.08 - 3096.24] unbelievable what happens but both sides
[3093.24 - 3098.56] of the aisle both sides of this C the
[3096.24 - 3102.16] camps two camps out there Hatfields and
[3098.56 - 3104.08] The McCoys both sides are playing around
[3102.16 - 3107.60] with a volleyball with protein written
[3104.08 - 3110.68] on it and they're both getting suckered
[3107.60 - 3113.04] suckered suckered suckered it's so sad
[3110.68 - 3114.76] and so so really you're only going to
[3113.04 - 3116.12] hear this from me and it's the only time
[3114.76 - 3118.04] you're ever going to hear hear it you're
[3116.12 - 3119.36] going to hear it for me okay I talk
[3118.04 - 3120.52] about it in the liver book though but
[3119.36 - 3122.72] I'm saying you're only going to hear it
[3120.52 - 3124.28] like this like this in this radio show
[3122.72 - 3127.08] because you know what I don't want to
[3124.28 - 3130.44] waste my time on the stupidity of the
[3127.08 - 3133.24] protein problem it's almost nauseating
[3130.44 - 3135.72] but I realize something you guys need
[3133.24 - 3137.96] this information so I have to just I
[3135.72 - 3139.76] just have to chill and I have to chill
[3137.96 - 3141.76] and realize I just got to give you what
[3139.76 - 3143.40] you need I've always lived by that I
[3141.76 - 3145.68] can't stop because of protein's that
[3143.40 - 3147.08] annoying I got to deliver and I got to
[3145.68 - 3149.00] stay delivering and that's what the
[3147.08 - 3150.56] medical medium radio show is all about
[3149.00 - 3152.24] well that's what I'm about as a soul as
[3150.56 - 3154.68] an individual and that's what spirit's
[3152.24 - 3157.80] about is I have to follow spirit's
[3154.68 - 3160.40] information because it's pure untampered
[3157.80 - 3163.16] with clean source of information that
[3160.40 - 3165.20] wasn't paid off by somebody somewhere
[3163.16 - 3167.76] down the line and the thumb wasn't put
[3165.20 - 3170.28] on some scale and it was twisted so that
[3167.76 - 3172.40] our human Minds get all twisted up with
[3170.28 - 3176.20] it and we don't heal and we don't get
[3172.40 - 3178.60] better okay so how much protein do you
[3176.20 - 3180.56] need I wouldn't even think about it it's
[3178.60 - 3182.60] everywhere in every food you eat you
[3180.56 - 3185.36] just think about are you getting enough
[3182.60 - 3187.12] carbs are you getting enough calories
[3185.36 - 3188.20] and I'm not talking about from a donut
[3187.12 - 3189.36] I'm not talking about from that and I'm
[3188.20 - 3191.72] going to tell you right now if you're
[3189.36 - 3193.48] into eggs kill the eggs whatever you do
[3191.72 - 3195.36] I should have mentioned that early on
[3193.48 - 3197.36] kill the eggs the eggs are a protein
[3195.36 - 3199.36] Source no matter what for vegetarians or
[3197.36 - 3203.48] whoever it is vegetarians animal eaters
[3199.36 - 3205.80] whatever eggs are bad they're bad they
[3203.48 - 3207.16] feed every virus every disease every
[3205.80 - 3208.92] bacteria that science of research
[3207.16 - 3210.40] doesn't even know about or understand or
[3208.92 - 3212.96] haven't even understand or discovered or
[3210.40 - 3215.52] research and that are the real reasons
[3212.96 - 3217.92] why you're sick it's not protein it's
[3215.52 - 3220.96] because of things that
[3217.92 - 3222.60] feed things like viruses and disease and
[3220.96 - 3223.88] guess what too much protein and you're
[3222.60 - 3225.20] worried about too much protein and you
[3223.88 - 3227.12] want to eat that much protein you will
[3225.20 - 3229.60] feed these viruses and eggs is one of
[3227.12 - 3230.96] them you lower your animal products down
[3229.60 - 3232.40] you get rid of your eggs you get rid of
[3230.96 - 3234.56] your dairy products you lower things
[3232.40 - 3236.32] down and you heal and the plant-based

[3238.20 - 3240.88] make you paranoid have a handful here
[3239.64 - 3243.96] and there but make sure you're getting
[3240.88 - 3246.48] all the other things and that's critical
[3243.96 - 3248.36] too that's critical but don't focus on
[3246.48 - 3249.72] protein you guys try not to but you know
[3248.36 - 3250.96] what I could say that a million times

[3253.20 - 3259.20] smack me in the head at the same
[3256.64 - 3261.76] time because it's out there to the point
[3259.20 - 3263.60] where you can't even dial something in
