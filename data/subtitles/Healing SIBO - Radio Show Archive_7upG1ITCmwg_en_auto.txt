[0.24 - 4.16] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.60 - 6.28] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.16 - 7.76] show where each week we bring Advanced
[6.28 - 10.52] Health
[7.76 - 13.60] Information that's years ahead of where
[10.52 - 16.00] science and medical research is now and
[13.60 - 19.40] um hey who has 10 or 20 years to wait
[16.00 - 21.28] for information too I hear it all the
[19.40 - 23.16] time I hear it all the time what people
[21.28 - 25.96] go through and how many years they have
[23.16 - 27.88] to wait and you to get to get results
[25.96 - 29.44] and everything else you know you have to
[27.88 - 31.84] know I want everybody to know the
[29.44 - 33.84] information here doesn't come from
[31.84 - 36.36] interest groups medical funding with
[33.84 - 39.44] strings attached botched research
[36.36 - 42.44] lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded
[39.44 - 45.44] belief systems private panels of
[42.44 - 49.08] influencers and health field payoffs or
[45.44 - 51.20] trendy traps the information health
[49.08 - 53.76] information that spirit and I are
[51.20 - 57.20] bringing to you that I share comes from
[53.76 - 60.12] a pure untampered with Advanced Clean
[57.20 - 62.04] Source a higher source the spirit Spirit
[60.12 - 63.24] of compassion there's nothing more
[62.04 - 65.68] healing than
[63.24 - 67.16] compassion and you know when you think
[65.68 - 69.72] about it well hey wait a minute you must
[67.16 - 71.64] be just talking about conventional
[69.72 - 74.16] medicine no I'm talking about
[71.64 - 76.72] alternative too all the things I just
[74.16 - 79.20] mentioned Kickbacks persuaded belief
[76.72 - 81.92] systems private panel of influencers to
[79.20 - 84.72] make the thumb on the scale go a certain
[81.92 - 87.56] direction because investors and money
[84.72 - 89.52] invested into something you guys have to
[87.56 - 91.92] know something about both alternative
[89.52 - 93.48] and people think it's all conventional
[91.92 - 96.32] meaning conventional is where all the
[93.48 - 98.68] sour the sour stuff happens that's what
[96.32 - 101.24] everybody says actually that's not true
[98.68 - 103.92] I'm sorry to say it's painstaking it's
[101.24 - 107.72] painstaking that say this but it's
[103.92 - 110.60] alternative too because when someone's
[107.72 - 113.08] invested and a group is invested to get
[110.60 - 115.88] an outcome through science and research
[113.08 - 118.16] the thumb is put on the scale in most of
[115.88 - 120.96] the cases because the money is going to
[118.16 - 123.48] be lost people are going to be really
[120.96 - 126.68] really angry funding's not going to
[123.48 - 129.48] occur again and so things have to kind
[126.68 - 131.44] of get persuaded one way or another I'm
[129.48 - 134.16] telling you this because guess what the
[131.44 - 136.72] information that's here doesn't hold
[134.16 - 138.76] that contamination attached to it
[136.72 - 140.40] because that's what happens and you know
[138.76 - 141.96] there I I see it out there I see
[140.40 - 144.40] information in the health realm both
[141.96 - 146.80] conventional and alternative and it it's
[144.40 - 148.92] got contamination to it because there's
[146.80 - 150.68] something going on with it that's you
[148.92 - 152.16] know going a certain Direction because
[150.68 - 153.84] of these reasons that's not going to
[152.16 - 155.52] happen here I've refused to let it
[153.84 - 159.00] happen here the information you're
[155.52 - 160.84] getting here comes from Spirit and So
[159.00 - 162.08] for anybody who's new in this show you
[160.84 - 163.60] know listening to this show and you're
[162.08 - 166.20] brand new to this and you're like okay

[237.64 - 241.52] that book has the most advanced
[239.16 - 245.12] information it's never before ever been
[241.52 - 247.72] in anybody's hands and I'm in there and
[245.12 - 249.32] you know so when I when I get to the
[247.72 - 251.20] Instagram and I'm seeing the feed and
[249.32 - 252.76] I'm looking at what people have what
[251.20 - 255.64] they're doing with their lives with this
[252.76 - 255.64] information I'm
[268.60 - 272.60] reinpuck that means it's changing
[270.68 - 274.48] everybody else's lives and that's what
[272.60 - 276.96] really hits me that's what really hits
[274.48 - 279.48] me it's changing other people's lives
[276.96 - 281.44] and getting them inspired it's inspiring
[279.48 - 284.48] me it's inspiring everybody and you know
[281.44 - 287.04] and it's incredible it really is someone
[284.48 - 289.16] said to me the other day someone said
[287.04 - 291.52] you know why do I even need any of your
[289.16 - 293.80] books why do I even need it I could just
[291.52 - 295.48] listen to your radio show and that's
[293.80 - 296.84] what somebody said to me the other day
[295.48 - 298.88] they said well I said what do you mean
[296.84 - 300.12] you don't you don't have the book One
[298.88 - 301.36] medical media
[300.12 - 303.76] you don't have that with all that
[301.36 - 306.00] information in there so no I I felt like
[303.76 - 307.68] I didn't have to get it I you don't have
[306.00 - 309.60] life-changing Foods well why you talk
[307.68 - 311.24] about fruits and vegetables on the show
[309.60 - 313.28] I said there's so many things I don't
[311.24 - 316.40] talk about on this show that are in
[313.28 - 318.20] those books and that that and and then
[316.40 - 320.00] and then the person said to me well you
[318.20 - 322.56] know normally when people put books
[320.00 - 324.84] together they're usually just kind of
[322.56 - 326.68] like the ideas there it's in the book
[324.84 - 328.44] The Concept is there the idea is there
[326.68 - 330.20] and that's great but usually when they
[328.44 - 331.60] go talking on their podcast or radio
[330.20 - 334.12] shows or whatever it is they're they're
[331.60 - 336.76] they're talking way more I go that's not
[334.12 - 338.56] the case this is this is information
[336.76 - 342.00] from Spirit that I placed into these
[338.56 - 343.80] books for spirit and for everybody that
[342.00 - 346.12] I don't talk about there's so many
[343.80 - 349.08] different facets and pieces of fabric
[346.12 - 350.44] all in those books and and and this
[349.08 - 352.92] person said you know what I'll go I'll
[350.44 - 354.40] go get one and they went and got one
[352.92 - 356.64] they went into into the store and they
[354.40 - 358.32] got one and and they said you're right I
[356.64 - 360.12] never even heard you talk about this I
[358.32 - 363.64] go yeah
[360.12 - 365.16] yeah anyway anyway listen you guys I
[363.64 - 366.76] hope everybody's doing good I hope
[365.16 - 368.84] you're working hard on everything today
[366.76 - 372.96] we're talking about
[368.84 - 375.68] sibo talking about sibo today okay small
[372.96 - 377.52] intestinal bacterial overgrowth have you
[375.68 - 379.68] have you heard about that before I I
[377.52 - 382.16] mention it every now and then in a gut
[379.68 - 385.36] health show or I mention a little bit
[382.16 - 387.08] about it um in different ways you know
[385.36 - 388.48] when we talk about the different shows
[387.08 - 392.52] I've mentioned and have gone in and out
[388.48 - 395.00] but I think it deserves more time all on
[392.52 - 397.64] its own and we have a lot of different
[395.00 - 400.72] gut health issues and there's you know
[397.64 - 402.32] there's a lot of rampant sibo diagnosis
[400.72 - 404.68] going out there
[402.32 - 407.80] constantly and we need we need it kind
[404.68 - 411.32] of aired out and we need the information
[407.80 - 412.56] in your hands because you know there's
[411.32 - 414.72] there's something to be said you go to
[412.56 - 416.72] the doctor's office you know whatever
[414.72 - 418.44] doctor that could be you know and and
[416.72 - 420.48] and all doctors I have tremendous
[418.44 - 422.80] respect for because the minute you want
[420.48 - 424.36] to be a doctor you know and and that's
[422.80 - 426.72] like it with anything the minute you
[424.36 - 428.40] want to just help anybody even if you're
[426.72 - 430.12] not a doctor and you want to say hey
[428.40 - 432.56] look drink the celery juice and you're
[430.12 - 434.24] not even a doctor I respect all of this
[432.56 - 438.16] because what it means is there's
[434.24 - 440.84] something inherently deep inside of us
[438.16 - 442.04] that makes us want to help people and so
[440.84 - 443.56] you know that but there's something when
[442.04 - 445.32] you go to the doctor and you get you
[443.56 - 447.32] know get told you get you know you get a
[445.32 - 448.76] test or you know different kinds of
[447.32 - 450.04] tests doctors do different things they
[448.76 - 451.80] have different
[450.04 - 454.76] do you know a breath a breath test
[451.80 - 456.28] they'll do um you know some doctors
[454.76 - 457.60] actually just start scooping out you
[456.28 - 459.00] know they take a Q-tip and they start
[457.60 - 460.88] doing cultures in the mouth and they're
[459.00 - 463.36] doing that now they just start you know
[460.88 - 465.12] what basically putting you know doing
[463.36 - 468.20] cultures on on different areas of your
[465.12 - 470.60] mouth looking for things and you know
[468.20 - 473.36] stool samples right you know doctors
[470.60 - 475.12] want to do that too and you know and you
[473.36 - 477.92] get told you have
[475.12 - 480.00] sibo and you're like okay well okay I
[477.92 - 481.28] got sibo now what
[480.00 - 483.00] and a lot of good doctors be like well
[481.28 - 485.28] you got to do the antibiotics you have
[483.00 - 488.08] to do the antibiotics for sibo I don't
[485.28 - 491.04] like doing the antibiotics for sibo I
[488.08 - 494.16] don't like that because you know and and
[491.04 - 496.24] I understand with respect with respect
[494.16 - 500.36] you know that that's that's a tool
[496.24 - 503.52] that's used out there but the problem is
[500.36 - 506.48] with that is when it comes down to sibo
[503.52 - 509.96] nobody knows what it is nobody knows
[506.48 - 513.96] what it is it's just bacteria
[509.96 - 517.68] nobody knows what kind really what kind
[513.96 - 520.24] like what's causing that overgrowth
[517.68 - 523.28] what's causing what kind of bacteria is
[520.24 - 524.80] that overgrowth I mean you some of you
[523.28 - 526.84] probably already know the answer and
[524.80 - 529.60] you're like oh yeah I know what he's
[526.84 - 532.96] going to say and you're right I'm going
[529.60 - 535.68] to say strep strep bacteria strep a
[532.96 - 536.84] coaco stacus however people different
[535.68 - 538.88] people call it different things for
[536.84 - 542.04] different reason but the point is it's
[538.88 - 545.92] Str rep that's the bacteria that's
[542.04 - 548.72] behind sio that's the front runner
[545.92 - 550.76] that's the big front runner now how is
[548.72 - 552.60] it possible we can't get a solid
[550.76 - 554.64] diagnosis whether you do stool sample or
[552.60 - 556.16] breath test or whatever it is how can we
[554.64 - 560.56] get a solid
[556.16 - 562.84] diagnosis of it being strep because it
[560.56 - 564.96] can't because when streps been in the
[562.84 - 567.32] system too long and it starts at
[564.96 - 569.76] childhood for a whole bunch of reasons
[567.32 - 572.36] it starts right from childhood
[569.76 - 575.56] right at the very beginning could be
[572.36 - 578.80] passed on from Mommy Daddy okay could be
[575.56 - 582.52] passed on and it also could easily be
[578.80 - 585.72] picked up so simply and you know in in
[582.52 - 588.60] daycare center okay and you know and
[585.72 - 592.64] kindergarten in school or whatever and
[588.60 - 595.20] strep is easily passed along and there's
[592.64 - 597.00] so many different varieties of strep
[595.20 - 601.44] that when you start with it in the
[597.00 - 605.28] system young it changes how it can ever
[601.44 - 608.88] be tested for or discovered or
[605.28 - 611.28] seen by medical research and medical
[608.88 - 613.52] science in fact it's so elusive it's
[611.28 - 615.92] virtually impossible to know how to
[613.52 - 617.20] identify it or test for it for instance
[615.92 - 620.00] you know I talked about this before you
[617.20 - 621.24] know this that UTI are mostly strep
[620.00 - 624.64] yeast is
[621.24 - 627.56] present but they can't tests for the
[624.64 - 629.12] strep now they look for strep for you
[627.56 - 631.32] know when you're in the pregnancy MO
[629.12 - 633.92] mode and and they want to you know they
[631.32 - 637.00] want to do the strep test vaginally and
[633.92 - 638.44] they look for it there and and sometimes
[637.00 - 641.20] they'll they'll find it because they're
[638.44 - 643.64] looking really hard for it uh but most
[641.20 - 645.20] of the time it's impossible to find but
[643.64 - 647.72] it's the only time they even kind of
[645.20 - 650.36] research and science even care to kind
[647.72 - 652.52] of look for it but you know it but it's
[650.36 - 654.64] not tested or looked for with bacterial
[652.52 - 656.96] vaginosis it's not which which is caused
[654.64 - 658.40] by strep is the front runner it's not
[656.96 - 660.44] it's not looked at with anything else
[658.40 - 663.40] with UTI forget it it's never looked at
[660.44 - 666.48] with e it's just UTI it's just a
[663.40 - 668.92] bacterial infection it's just a yeast
[666.48 - 670.56] infection and because strep is so
[668.92 - 672.88] elusive it's really hard to test for
[670.56 - 676.96] it's really hard to look at when it's
[672.88 - 681.40] been there a long time it's been there a
[676.96 - 683.80] long time and with sibo sibo is the
[681.40 - 685.20] ultimate situation where strep is in the
[683.80 - 687.68] body it's in the system it's in the
[685.20 - 690.20] intestinal tract it's
[687.68 - 692.48] there and
[690.20 - 694.88] it's it's it can't be discovered so
[692.48 - 696.72] easily in fact it's never discovered you
[694.88 - 698.68] know and of course you can theoretically
[696.72 - 700.08] say well you know doctor say well it
[698.68 - 702.20] could be a bunch of different bacteria
[700.08 - 705.68] it could be um a whole bunch of
[702.20 - 707.00] different things but people have a lot
[705.68 - 709.52] in them and I want to talk about
[707.00 - 713.00] something I want to talk about something
[709.52 - 714.32] a question that I'm always asked
[713.00 - 718.32] question that I'm always asked by
[714.32 - 720.44] professionals is how can there be
[718.32 - 721.52] bacteria
[720.44 - 725.36] in the
[721.52 - 728.48] gut in general when we have hydrochloric
[725.36 - 730.60] acid in the stomach that actually you
[728.48 - 733.28] know kills off any bacteria that's
[730.60 - 734.64] possible so how can there be bacteria
[733.28 - 737.64] and then some professionals will say
[734.64 - 739.32] well you know um in the intestinal tract
[737.64 - 740.92] there's there's you know there's no
[739.32 - 742.56] hydrochloric acid some professionals
[740.92 - 745.92] will say so you know I could see
[742.56 - 746.72] bacteria being in there but what about
[745.92 - 749.08] the
[746.72 - 750.48] stomach you know how is it possible to
[749.08 - 754.12] bacteria in the
[750.48 - 758.04] stomach and it's very possible very
[754.12 - 760.20] possible so it's not just CBO is not
[758.04 - 763.00] small intestinal track is what I'm
[760.20 - 765.40] trying to say
[763.00 - 769.96] sibo is
[765.40 - 772.12] stomach dadum small intestinal track
[769.96 - 776.20] large intestinal
[772.12 - 778.60] track that's where you know sibo is it's
[776.20 - 779.88] all the way at the beginning to all the
[778.60 - 784.36] way to the
[779.88 - 787.92] end sibo is even ESOP
[784.36 - 790.64] esophagus sibo is even
[787.92 - 793.08] mouth all the way down to
[790.64 - 795.52] rectum so here's another thing that's
[793.08 - 798.32] happening is is you know right now the
[795.52 - 800.28] trend is um look you got it's small
[798.32 - 802.60] intestinal tract overgrowth you got you
[800.28 - 804.20] know you got some bacteria and that's
[802.60 - 808.84] you know that's what we call
[804.20 - 812.44] sio but it's it it's literally mouth all
[808.84 - 815.68] all the way down and out to the
[812.44 - 816.76] rectum that's where the bacteria H you
[815.68 - 820.00] know can
[816.76 - 821.52] lie and we have to keep that in mind
[820.00 - 825.68] that's a big that's a big piece that's
[821.52 - 826.48] kind of missing in the trendy atmosphere
[825.68 - 828.96] of
[826.48 - 832.16] sibo but how can it be there with
[828.96 - 834.04] hydrochloric acid and the ability to
[832.16 - 836.76] kind of use that hydrochloric acid to
[834.04 - 838.16] break down and kill bacteria in the
[836.76 - 840.08] stomach so some professionals be like
[838.16 - 842.88] it's possible to have bacteria in the
[840.08 - 845.72] stomach it's impossible it's not even
[842.88 - 848.20] possible and that's not true that's not
[845.72 - 850.52] true at all because you know spirit and
[848.20 - 851.64] I brought to the table that hydrochloric
[850.52 - 854.68] acid is
[851.64 - 859.68] complicated it's not one
[854.68 - 863.60] acid it's a blend so even if someone
[859.68 - 866.04] seems to have elevated enough elevated
[863.60 - 867.88] hydrochloric acid you guys someone that
[866.04 - 871.44] seems like you know if the doctor's like
[867.88 - 872.56] no your HC seems to be strong doing a
[871.44 - 875.28] saliva test we're doing different
[872.56 - 877.12] testing and and now your htl seems to be
[875.28 - 879.76] strong you don't have real low
[877.12 - 883.32] HCL you could have
[879.76 - 885.96] low um different parts of the
[883.32 - 887.88] hydrochloric acid combination that only
[885.96 - 889.68] spirit and I have brought to the table I
[887.88 - 891.08] say that in case you're you're brand new
[889.68 - 893.36] to listening to the show and you're like
[891.08 - 895.84] well what can he bring that's new and
[893.36 - 898.92] different why is the show you know doing
[895.84 - 902.52] so good what's what can he bring well
[898.92 - 906.44] for one and and the whole hydrochloric
[902.52 - 910.08] acid thing is it's a complex blend of
[906.44 - 912.72] acids it's a seven blend it's a seven
[910.08 - 915.52] blend and I love that number seven look
[912.72 - 918.00] out for seven that's that's the number
[915.52 - 920.24] you want to look out for keep your mind
[918.00 - 921.80] and eye on that number you'll see it
[920.24 - 924.88] popping up more and more so the
[921.80 - 927.08] hydrochloric hasd blend took you off
[924.88 - 929.16] track really sorry about that it took
[927.08 - 931.16] you off track all right hey did I tell
[929.16 - 932.72] you to fasten this your seat belts too
[931.16 - 934.36] okay let's fasten your seat bels for
[932.72 - 936.96] this this one it's going to get pretty
[934.36 - 940.92] good so that seven
[936.96 - 946.04] blend three of that seven blend could be
[940.92 - 948.48] out gone low really low no one's going
[946.04 - 953.04] to know no one's going to know because
[948.48 - 956.40] four of that seven blend one of the four
[953.04 - 958.08] of that seven blend is what everybody's
[956.40 - 961.08] more familiar with it's what science and
[958.08 - 962.76] research is familiar with look I've
[961.08 - 965.08] always said this it's so important to
[962.76 - 967.32] know I don't care how much technology we
[965.08 - 968.68] have and I don't care how great science
[967.32 - 970.20] is getting well I do care because I want
[968.68 - 971.76] heart transplants I want everybody
[970.20 - 974.24] getting liver transplants if they need
[971.76 - 976.84] one I want kidneys replaced meaning I
[974.24 - 978.32] want kidneys you know um I want I want
[976.84 - 981.64] people to be able to donate a kidney I
[978.32 - 985.72] want all these things and then some I
[981.64 - 987.92] want it all but the problem is you know
[985.72 - 989.88] when it comes down to just even the most
[987.92 - 991.84] simplest thing of what happens to food
[989.88 - 993.92] when it enters your mouth and goes when
[991.84 - 995.88] it enters your stomach when it enters
[993.92 - 998.68] your stomach what happens to food is a
[995.88 - 1001.24] mystery that will not be solved for
[998.68 - 1003.00] hundreds and hundreds of years I'm not
[1001.24 - 1004.12] talking about decades I'm talking about
[1003.00 - 1007.84] hundreds of
[1004.12 - 1009.76] years that mystery will not be so solved
[1007.84 - 1011.20] because I'm going to tell you right now
[1009.76 - 1014.80] one of the reasons why it won't be
[1011.20 - 1017.56] solved is because that's a Godly thing
[1014.80 - 1020.40] that's a God thing that's where God
[1017.56 - 1022.24] that's where it's it's a it's about God
[1020.40 - 1024.20] okay it's about the higher power the
[1022.24 - 1026.88] higher source it's whatever whatever you
[1024.20 - 1028.68] believe is up there some people they say
[1026.88 - 1031.48] well I just believe it's a light I'm I
[1028.68 - 1033.00] go okay okay you know people say you
[1031.48 - 1035.40] know I just believe there's a light up
[1033.00 - 1037.48] there I go okay totally and you know I I
[1035.40 - 1040.48] support that absolutely I'm I'm I'm so
[1037.48 - 1042.88] thankful that you believe something is
[1040.48 - 1044.60] out or up there and some people be like
[1042.88 - 1046.48] I call it the Creator some people are
[1044.60 - 1047.80] like you know and some people like you
[1046.48 - 1049.84] know I call it the universe some people
[1047.80 - 1051.64] are like yeah call and I'm like I of
[1049.84 - 1053.96] course I mean I call it I call God
[1051.64 - 1057.76] that's what I say it's God and that's
[1053.96 - 1061.56] what I do and so whatever your belief is
[1057.76 - 1066.84] of what's up there just know that that
[1061.56 - 1068.88] has a hand on a handle on what happens
[1066.84 - 1071.12] to food when it enters your
[1068.88 - 1072.60] stomach what happens with food when it
[1071.12 - 1075.60] enters your
[1072.60 - 1078.00] stomach so as far as we are with
[1075.60 - 1079.48] technology even in medical research and
[1078.00 - 1082.08] science in different aspects in
[1079.48 - 1084.24] different ways you know and we with all
[1082.08 - 1086.88] the amazing things that we're
[1084.24 - 1088.64] developing is that's the mystery all on
[1086.88 - 1089.48] its own so can you imagine the mystery
[1088.64 - 1093.32] of
[1089.48 - 1095.28] sibo or bacteria and how it works in the
[1093.32 - 1097.60] stomach or in the intestinal
[1095.28 - 1102.60] track and that's why I'm kind of be
[1097.60 - 1105.72] bringing that up so you can have some of
[1102.60 - 1107.88] the some of those pieces of that seven
[1105.72 - 1111.76] blend of the hydrochloric acid you can
[1107.88 - 1114.52] have two or three low two or three
[1111.76 - 1118.24] components elements to that seven
[1114.52 - 1121.12] blend of hydrochloric acid they could be
[1118.24 - 1123.64] low and even though you seem like you
[1121.12 - 1125.36] have high
[1123.64 - 1129.76] HCL
[1125.36 - 1133.20] right and what happens then is bacteria
[1129.76 - 1136.20] doesn't die it doesn't die when it
[1133.20 - 1138.96] enters the stomach or when it goes up
[1136.20 - 1141.04] into the stomach from the intestinal
[1138.96 - 1143.56] tract so when and I was telling a
[1141.04 - 1146.28] professional this I was telling somebody
[1143.56 - 1147.56] this was a practitioner I was saying
[1146.28 - 1151.04] look you have to understand that
[1147.56 - 1155.80] bacteria moves and grooves it does a
[1151.04 - 1157.36] dance okay and it and it it can travel
[1155.80 - 1159.56] like yeah yeah yeah I know that I know
[1157.36 - 1161.32] it could bacteria can travel I know that
[1159.56 - 1164.00] go but it can travel up into your
[1161.32 - 1165.76] stomach even if you think you got the
[1164.00 - 1168.96] best strongest hydrochloric acid there
[1165.76 - 1171.08] is to kill it it could travel up there
[1168.96 - 1173.56] and get there so you want to keep your
[1171.08 - 1174.68] hydrochloric acid strong so a big part
[1173.56 - 1176.64] of what we're talking about today with
[1174.68 - 1178.76] sios is keeping that hydrochloric acid
[1176.64 - 1182.64] strong that's going to be a big part of
[1178.76 - 1185.80] it really really big part because that
[1182.64 - 1187.20] bacteria can crawl right up there and
[1185.80 - 1190.84] get up into the
[1187.20 - 1192.68] tummy and it can start doing things you
[1190.84 - 1195.16] know there's people with ulcers they got
[1192.68 - 1199.36] ulcers in the stomach these ulcers are
[1195.16 - 1202.68] created by what by what back bacteria
[1199.36 - 1204.84] they're created by bacteria these ulcers
[1202.68 - 1206.92] Scar Tissue occurs ulcers they mend they
[1204.84 - 1208.68] heel they open again mend in heel open
[1206.92 - 1211.44] sores and ulcers in the stomach why
[1208.68 - 1214.44] because there's bacteria there's people
[1211.44 - 1216.72] with what seemingly seems like enough
[1214.44 - 1218.80] hydrochloric acid and enough powerful
[1216.72 - 1221.48] hydrochloric acid but why do they have
[1218.80 - 1223.68] the ulcers because they're missing
[1221.48 - 1227.16] pieces of the hydrochloric acid out of
[1223.68 - 1230.08] the seven blend they're missing some of
[1227.16 - 1233.20] them and maybe some of the most
[1230.08 - 1236.80] important ones out of that seven
[1233.20 - 1238.40] blend the most important ones so it's
[1236.80 - 1240.20] about getting that hydrochloric acid
[1238.40 - 1242.84] really strong it's about getting that
[1240.20 - 1244.92] hydrochloric acid in a much better way
[1242.84 - 1246.76] so bacteria can be in the stomach but it
[1244.92 - 1248.24] can be in all kinds of different places
[1246.76 - 1251.00] which bacteria we talking about we're
[1248.24 - 1254.52] talking about talking about the
[1251.00 - 1258.12] strep and that's the one and what I like
[1254.52 - 1259.80] about strep it's once you got a hand
[1258.12 - 1261.52] handle on what's going on once you know
[1259.80 - 1263.64] what's going on you can take control you
[1261.52 - 1266.08] can do stuff you can heal nothing can
[1263.64 - 1268.88] stop you from healing once you have the
[1266.08 - 1270.96] information the body the body wants to
[1268.88 - 1274.84] heal but it has to connect to something
[1270.96 - 1276.80] it has to connect to also information
[1274.84 - 1281.08] that you've that you've
[1276.80 - 1282.80] gathered you got to cut on your hand you
[1281.08 - 1286.44] got to cut on your
[1282.80 - 1289.12] hand and if you don't have information
[1286.44 - 1291.72] your body wants to heal that cut if you
[1289.12 - 1293.40] don't have information to keep that
[1291.72 - 1295.84] wound
[1293.40 - 1299.56] clean and
[1295.84 - 1301.48] dry and care for it just say you don't
[1299.56 - 1303.88] want to do any of that say you want to
[1301.48 - 1307.04] bang your hand around stick it you know
[1303.88 - 1309.48] stick stick it someplace grab something
[1307.04 - 1312.56] all the time constantly injuring the
[1309.48 - 1315.24] wound not ever cleaning it not ever
[1312.56 - 1319.40] washing it out not ever putting a little
[1315.24 - 1320.80] bandage on it for now not doing anything
[1319.40 - 1322.52] there's a chance your body is going to
[1320.80 - 1324.40] be like look we're doing everything we
[1322.52 - 1325.80] can we got your immune system we got
[1324.40 - 1327.68] your killer cells we got your blood
[1325.80 - 1329.48] count we got everything on top of that
[1327.68 - 1331.28] wound going going going and we're
[1329.48 - 1332.72] knocking down that bacteria we're
[1331.28 - 1334.48] knocking down anything else we're
[1332.72 - 1335.48] knocking down staff that could get on
[1334.48 - 1338.24] that
[1335.48 - 1340.72] wound but it's too much because you
[1338.24 - 1342.56] don't have the information to take care
[1340.72 - 1344.36] of that wound you don't have the
[1342.56 - 1346.88] information to take care of that
[1344.36 - 1349.36] wound you you're not doing anything for
[1346.88 - 1350.92] it you're not putting salt on that wound
[1349.36 - 1352.68] salt on a wound is actually really
[1350.92 - 1354.28] healing even though it can hurt like
[1352.68 - 1356.68] hell you're not you know you're not
[1354.28 - 1358.36] cleaning it you're not washing it you're
[1356.68 - 1360.44] not looking at it you're not care for
[1358.36 - 1362.32] caring for it you're not putting an
[1360.44 - 1366.40] herbal pus on
[1362.32 - 1368.76] it P you know so whatever it is the
[1366.40 - 1372.48] information has to be there too to help
[1368.76 - 1375.24] the body to help the body you know some
[1372.48 - 1377.12] people I my god I've heard this o over
[1375.24 - 1378.32] the years people have gone to a lot of
[1377.12 - 1380.28] different practitioners a lot of
[1378.32 - 1382.76] different doctors they've been all over
[1380.28 - 1384.84] the globe they've traveled everywhere
[1382.76 - 1387.24] they've you know they've taken planes
[1384.84 - 1391.28] across the I mean across the
[1387.24 - 1393.72] world and for answers oh they're still
[1391.28 - 1395.92] sick because their body wants to heal
[1393.72 - 1398.12] it's keeping them going but they just
[1395.92 - 1402.04] need the answers
[1398.12 - 1403.48] too and that's the other half it's the
[1402.04 - 1408.16] other
[1403.48 - 1410.80] half knowing you know what's wrong is is
[1408.16 - 1412.84] half the battle knowing how to heal it
[1410.80 - 1414.96] is the other half of the battle spirit
[1412.84 - 1416.88] taught me that Spirit taught me that a
[1414.96 - 1419.88] long time ago when I was
[1416.88 - 1421.52] young when I was really young when I was
[1419.88 - 1425.48] in my single
[1421.52 - 1427.76] digits and spirit tell me that half the
[1425.48 - 1429.96] battle is knowing what's wrong the other
[1427.76 - 1432.32] half is what to do about
[1429.96 - 1434.32] it and you know and your body's fighting
[1432.32 - 1435.84] for you no matter what in and out of all
[1434.32 - 1438.56] of it
[1435.84 - 1441.64] so with sibo
[1438.56 - 1442.92] yeah with strep it's conquerable really
[1441.64 - 1444.96] conquerable when you know what you're
[1442.92 - 1447.32] dealing with here's here's something
[1444.96 - 1449.16] that's important if you think your your
[1447.32 - 1451.76] overgrowth of bacteria is a whole bunch
[1449.16 - 1454.32] of different random bacteria and you
[1451.76 - 1457.32] don't really know which ones it doesn't
[1454.32 - 1461.04] help you it doesn't help
[1457.32 - 1463.84] you enough it doesn't help you
[1461.04 - 1466.56] enough but knowing this is the strep
[1463.84 - 1469.40] that was your strep throat 20 years ago
[1466.56 - 1470.92] this is the this is the STP that was you
[1469.40 - 1474.28] know that whole
[1470.92 - 1476.20] strep um hand and mouth strep that you
[1474.28 - 1479.60] had when you were 8 years
[1476.20 - 1482.08] old this is that strep that was you know
[1479.60 - 1485.24] the swollen tons
[1482.08 - 1487.28] soles when you had swollen tonsils this
[1485.24 - 1490.60] is the strep that was that worst sinus
[1487.28 - 1494.72] infection you had ever years
[1490.60 - 1496.60] ago this is a strep that was that UTI
[1494.72 - 1498.84] that was a pain in your butt that one
[1496.60 - 1501.16] time in your life
[1498.84 - 1504.84] when you know how to identify it this is
[1501.16 - 1507.28] that strep that gave me sty in the eye
[1504.84 - 1510.32] when you know how to identify it and
[1507.28 - 1512.20] what it is it changes everything it
[1510.32 - 1516.24] changes
[1512.20 - 1517.52] everything everything I'm serious if you
[1516.24 - 1519.00] know this is the strep that did the
[1517.52 - 1521.12] sinus infection this is the strep that
[1519.00 - 1522.84] gives you yeah that belly ache this is
[1521.12 - 1525.24] the strep that gives you that
[1522.84 - 1527.08] inflammation in different areas it
[1525.24 - 1528.96] matters this is the strep that causes
[1527.08 - 1531.04] all that severe cystic
[1528.96 - 1534.20] acne and now all of a sudden I'm
[1531.04 - 1536.44] diagnosed years later with with
[1534.20 - 1538.64] sibo a people
[1536.44 - 1540.00] say they're diagnosed you know years
[1538.64 - 1541.84] later with sibo and they're like okay
[1540.00 - 1544.52] what's this now when you know what it is
[1541.84 - 1546.76] and what's been in your system it's
[1544.52 - 1548.16] lifechanging it's lifechanging maybe
[1546.76 - 1549.84] some of you are like oh I don't want to
[1548.16 - 1551.48] know what it is I kind of like going to
[1549.84 - 1552.68] the doctor and just been like okay what
[1551.48 - 1555.32] is it okay I'll just take this
[1552.68 - 1559.08] antibiotic and I respect that I honor
[1555.32 - 1561.08] that because you know it's not it's not
[1559.08 - 1564.00] it's not like everything's so easy it's
[1561.08 - 1565.32] it's not so I'm with you but hang in
[1564.00 - 1567.68] there if you're one of those you know
[1565.32 - 1568.84] kind of people you know just know I love
[1567.68 - 1569.92] you and you're one of those kind of
[1568.84 - 1572.52] people that're like look I don't know
[1569.92 - 1573.68] what's going on but but hang in there
[1572.52 - 1575.84] because it's still we're still going to
[1573.68 - 1577.00] do some things that that are helpful
[1575.84 - 1579.00] because if you're dealing with something
[1577.00 - 1580.40] you're suffering or you're really going
[1579.00 - 1581.88] through something it's important to know
[1580.40 - 1584.88] these
[1581.88 - 1586.48] things so knowing what it is is
[1584.88 - 1589.52] important and that's the key knowing
[1586.48 - 1591.44] that it's just a melt pot a bacteria
[1589.52 - 1593.56] that's possibly in your stomach no Rhyme
[1591.44 - 1597.44] or Reason Tak an antibiotic hope for the
[1593.56 - 1599.88] best is really not not the best and L
[1597.44 - 1602.80] even in when it's alternative
[1599.88 - 1604.20] medicine and you know you get a really
[1602.80 - 1607.28] good practitioner and they give you some
[1604.20 - 1610.32] herbs and they change your diet you need
[1607.28 - 1613.56] to know more because it's time to
[1610.32 - 1615.96] conquer the bacteria that's wreaking
[1613.56 - 1618.56] havoc or causing problems or interfering
[1615.96 - 1620.92] with your life on any level
[1618.56 - 1622.92] level interfering with your life on any
[1620.92 - 1624.56] level and we want to do that we want to
[1622.92 - 1627.08] be able to do
[1624.56 - 1628.64] that so we have to look back at our
[1627.08 - 1631.44] lives and see well what happened earlier
[1628.64 - 1633.16] on in my life where could I what you
[1631.44 - 1636.52] know I did have a strep throat earlier
[1633.16 - 1639.44] on in my life whoa I see and that's
[1636.52 - 1641.92] that's how it works so strep is kind of
[1639.44 - 1644.68] elusive it stays in her body it lives in
[1641.92 - 1646.44] US it lives in us now the reason why I
[1644.68 - 1649.60] don't like the antibiotics with strep is
[1646.44 - 1652.08] because it it empow strep Don't Panic if
[1649.60 - 1654.40] you taking antibiotics it's fine meaning
[1652.08 - 1656.04] don't don't worry don't be like oh my
[1654.40 - 1658.12] God I took an antibiotic forward it must
[1656.04 - 1659.60] have been strep no it's it it listen
[1658.12 - 1661.72] it's okay the point is it's about
[1659.60 - 1666.56] forging ahead moving
[1661.72 - 1669.64] forward so strep tends to change it
[1666.56 - 1671.72] tends to get smart wise it gets immune
[1669.64 - 1673.12] to antibiotics and you got to do it use
[1671.72 - 1675.20] a different antibiotic I know people
[1673.12 - 1677.88] that have suffered from severe UTI
[1675.20 - 1679.40] because of strep and they've had to
[1677.88 - 1681.16] change different antibiotics they have
[1679.40 - 1682.76] to do a cocktail of antibiotics I've
[1681.16 - 1684.96] seen that over the years same thing with
[1682.76 - 1689.00] stomach problems same thing with Leebo
[1684.96 - 1692.28] same thing with other things and it the
[1689.00 - 1695.80] problem is is that strep tends to not
[1692.28 - 1698.84] get affected by the antibiotic anymore
[1695.80 - 1700.32] and it gets immune and it grows past it
[1698.84 - 1701.72] and it could get stronger and it can
[1700.32 - 1704.76] mutate and there's a lot of different
[1701.72 - 1706.32] varieties of strep now I think medical
[1704.76 - 1709.84] science research have something like
[1706.32 - 1711.32] groups through a through H so strep a
[1709.84 - 1712.96] the strep B those are the two main
[1711.32 - 1715.88] groups that science and research have
[1712.96 - 1718.12] been working with all these years and
[1715.88 - 1719.92] then it went you know then finally you
[1718.12 - 1721.84] know some some some funding and research
[1719.92 - 1723.24] went to a right the right place for at
[1721.84 - 1725.52] least the
[1723.24 - 1727.72] recognizing recognizing the fact that
[1725.52 - 1731.56] there's more groups sounds like a
[1727.72 - 1734.32] through H but there's not enough letters
[1731.56 - 1735.96] in the alphabet to match the groups and
[1734.32 - 1738.04] that's where it falls short that's where
[1735.96 - 1741.24] I was saying where the thumb is on the
[1738.04 - 1743.88] scale because I'm sure some amazing
[1741.24 - 1745.36] scientist or researcher that was
[1743.88 - 1746.88] researching the different groups of
[1745.36 - 1749.36] trying to classify the different groups
[1746.88 - 1751.08] of stre strep looking at them under the
[1749.36 - 1754.00] microscope wherever it can be gathered
[1751.08 - 1756.72] out of people I'm sure these amazing
[1754.00 - 1759.16] practitioners are like in the lab saying
[1756.72 - 1762.96] oh my God I think there's I think
[1759.16 - 1766.28] there's way more past a strep group a to
[1762.96 - 1768.56] Group H I think there's a lot more here
[1766.28 - 1771.96] and they can't do anything about it
[1768.56 - 1773.60] because someone else is in the way of
[1771.96 - 1775.20] everything I said originally when I was
[1773.60 - 1777.92] opening the show something else is in
[1775.20 - 1781.64] the way some some interest group is in
[1777.92 - 1783.56] the way for the scientists to be like
[1781.64 - 1786.20] wait a minute here we got a
[1783.56 - 1787.36] problem so so if there was you know
[1786.20 - 1788.76] there's not enough letters in the
[1787.36 - 1792.20] alphabet to match the amount of
[1788.76 - 1795.92] mutations and the group of strep that's
[1792.20 - 1799.32] creating the sibo the whole sibo effect
[1795.92 - 1799.32] that we're we're seeing out there
[1799.52 - 1806.12] and so taking control understanding what
[1801.96 - 1810.16] it is is actually starts to break down
[1806.12 - 1813.84] the bug itself so right now you and me
[1810.16 - 1816.32] just you right now together okay you and
[1813.84 - 1820.44] me know we
[1816.32 - 1822.36] know that that little bug is weak and
[1820.44 - 1825.76] I'll tell you why it's
[1822.36 - 1830.64] weak because your immune system is going
[1825.76 - 1834.24] after it as we're talking right now see
[1830.64 - 1835.80] knowing what's wrong knowing what to do
[1834.24 - 1837.96] okay that's that's the two pieces that
[1835.80 - 1840.88] Spirit taught me going all the way back
[1837.96 - 1842.36] knowing what's wrong knowing what to do
[1840.88 - 1844.32] what happens is when you know what's
[1842.36 - 1847.00] wrong your immune system connects to
[1844.32 - 1848.64] your thoughts you know that part you
[1847.00 - 1853.16] know your thoughts help govern your
[1848.64 - 1856.56] immune system you know that and but when
[1853.16 - 1860.32] you really know what you're after
[1856.56 - 1862.20] something really takes off really takes
[1860.32 - 1865.24] off and really takes place this is this
[1862.20 - 1867.16] is even more advanced than a whole thing
[1865.24 - 1869.40] kind of the thought power thing where
[1867.16 - 1871.80] you know you're you're thinking you're
[1869.40 - 1873.28] thinking you're healing and that's
[1871.80 - 1874.88] powerful where you're thinking your body
[1873.28 - 1877.96] can heal and that's powerful but you can
[1874.88 - 1880.12] take it to another level when you take
[1877.96 - 1882.88] it to the level of wait a minute I know
[1880.12 - 1886.56] it's giving me that small intestinal
[1882.88 - 1890.24] tract overgrowth now I know what bug it
[1886.56 - 1894.56] is what happens is your killer cells can
[1890.24 - 1897.40] connect to that very thing it can create
[1894.56 - 1900.84] what's an identification process that's
[1897.40 - 1904.88] beyond beyond our vision it's an
[1900.84 - 1906.68] identification process to the bacteria
[1904.88 - 1909.72] that means the immune system starts to
[1906.68 - 1912.44] redesign itself so your immune system
[1909.72 - 1914.04] right now right in this moment is
[1912.44 - 1917.16] redesigning
[1914.04 - 1918.52] itself seriously it's redesigning it
[1917.16 - 1921.28] itself I'm going to tell you how through
[1918.52 - 1923.92] chemical compounds chemical
[1921.28 - 1925.92] compounds our immune system has the
[1923.92 - 1928.92] ability to shape shift it has the
[1925.92 - 1931.56] ability to redirect itself it has the
[1928.92 - 1934.44] ability to take on new information just
[1931.56 - 1937.48] through frequencies of thought but it
[1934.44 - 1940.96] has more than that even more than all of
[1937.48 - 1942.60] that it has the ability to restructure
[1940.96 - 1944.24] chemical compounds not found in any
[1942.60 - 1946.20] science of research and maybe that'll be
[1944.24 - 1948.76] decades ahead of the time maybe two two
[1946.20 - 1951.84] three decades from now maybe 30 40
[1948.76 - 1954.56] years from now they'll figure out that
[1951.84 - 1957.08] chemical compounds are created by your
[1954.56 - 1959.88] different immune system you know your
[1957.08 - 1962.32] lymphocytes for example how they can
[1959.88 - 1964.76] change they can change by creating a new
[1962.32 - 1967.00] chemical that matches the understanding
[1964.76 - 1969.16] and information that you know about
[1967.00 - 1972.96] what's inside your body a chemical
[1969.16 - 1978.04] compound can develop from that alone and
[1972.96 - 1981.36] change to look for a bug that's been
[1978.04 - 1983.72] immune it's been immune to your immune
[1981.36 - 1985.28] system you know how we we're always like
[1983.72 - 1987.04] well you know let's we want we want to
[1985.28 - 1989.28] be immune to
[1987.04 - 1990.96] something we want to be immune to
[1989.28 - 1993.24] something if you're dealing with
[1990.96 - 1994.84] something emotional you know if you're
[1993.24 - 1996.52] dealing with problems emotionally if you
[1994.84 - 1998.12] have somebody that's that if you or you
[1996.52 - 2000.88] have somebody that's just causing
[1998.12 - 2002.92] trouble bullying or you got somebody in
[2000.88 - 2006.32] the workplace or whatever you want to be
[2002.92 - 2007.80] immune to them so you want you want to
[2006.32 - 2009.56] create
[2007.80 - 2011.40] something a foundation or you want to
[2009.56 - 2013.72] create something that could make you
[2011.40 - 2015.32] immune to them what I like to do is I
[2013.72 - 2017.84] like to use the word
[2015.32 - 2020.08] light in those
[2017.84 - 2022.68] situations if there's nothing more
[2020.08 - 2023.92] powerful somebody's bullying you at work
[2022.68 - 2026.36] someone's giving you a hard time or
[2023.92 - 2029.36] whatever it is I say the word
[2026.36 - 2032.20] light that's what I like to
[2029.36 - 2034.24] do and you here's here's the deal and
[2032.20 - 2035.52] I'm going to talk more about that in in
[2034.24 - 2039.84] another show we're going to talk more
[2035.52 - 2041.96] about that but the deal is the bug can
[2039.84 - 2043.44] have immunity too to our immune system
[2041.96 - 2045.52] and when you know what's going on and
[2043.44 - 2047.08] you know what's causing it it changes
[2045.52 - 2049.64] that your immune system changes and
[2047.08 - 2053.24] Alters in order to kill the bug and rid
[2049.64 - 2056.68] the U and R rid the sibo and and and rid
[2053.24 - 2060.24] the the um bacterial
[2056.68 - 2062.72] infections and you know rid the pelvic
[2060.24 - 2064.28] inflammatory um problems that that that
[2062.72 - 2067.00] a lot of women have too which is caused
[2064.28 - 2069.64] by different groups of strep and rids
[2067.00 - 2072.16] everything the sty that keep on coming
[2069.64 - 2074.64] the sore throats that keep on coming the
[2072.16 - 2077.36] sinus infections that keep on
[2074.64 - 2080.84] coming and of course the sibo the
[2077.36 - 2082.60] intestinal tract issue too so not only
[2080.84 - 2083.72] are we going to rebuild hydrochloric
[2082.60 - 2087.84] acid which what we're going to talk
[2083.72 - 2090.04] about next but it's about changing
[2087.84 - 2093.04] changing the structure of the immune
[2090.04 - 2096.84] system having it create new chemical
[2093.04 - 2098.20] compounds that strep is not immune to so
[2096.84 - 2100.80] so we can destroy it so we can start
[2098.20 - 2102.08] kicking it out of her body and that's
[2100.80 - 2103.84] why it's important to know what's going
[2102.08 - 2105.36] on so when you know and I've heard it
[2103.84 - 2107.16] before someone said you know said to me
[2105.36 - 2109.24] a while back I forget how long ago now
[2107.16 - 2111.36] this is but and I've heard it over the
[2109.24 - 2112.72] years here and there where somebody like
[2111.36 - 2114.56] I really don't want to know I don't want
[2112.72 - 2116.60] to know I just want to go to the doctor
[2114.56 - 2118.12] and I just want to know everything's
[2116.60 - 2120.04] okay and I didn't walk out and I don't
[2118.12 - 2122.60] want to know really what's what's
[2120.04 - 2125.52] happening in there and I'm I'm too young
[2122.60 - 2128.16] for to think about these things and I
[2125.52 - 2130.28] want to go out and I want to you know I
[2128.16 - 2133.12] want to have fun I want to have fun and
[2130.28 - 2135.32] I I of course we should have fun we need
[2133.12 - 2137.08] to have fun but it comes the time we
[2135.32 - 2139.56] need to know what's going on too inside
[2137.08 - 2141.92] of us to heal so let's get our
[2139.56 - 2144.64] hydrochloric acid built up when you get
[2141.92 - 2146.48] your hydrochloric acid built up you're
[2144.64 - 2149.36] killing bacteria that's trying to even
[2146.48 - 2152.00] get into the stomach and more than that
[2149.36 - 2154.28] hydrochloric acid runs deeper than the
[2152.00 - 2157.40] stomach it runs
[2154.28 - 2159.56] lower than the stomach how hydrochloric
[2157.40 - 2162.40] acid Works in the
[2159.56 - 2163.96] dadum and here's another thing unknown
[2162.40 - 2166.80] to research and science hydrochloric
[2163.96 - 2169.40] acid Works in the small intestinal tract
[2166.80 - 2172.28] but it goes down deeper in the small
[2169.40 - 2176.08] intestinal tract one of the reasons why
[2172.28 - 2179.36] that research and science isn't keen on
[2176.08 - 2183.36] that is because they're looking at one
[2179.36 - 2185.80] element one part one fraction of the
[2183.36 - 2188.08] seven blend hydrochloric acid that I'm
[2185.80 - 2189.04] talking about that not looking at the
[2188.08 - 2193.20] other
[2189.04 - 2194.92] six and some of the other six have a
[2193.20 - 2197.68] responsibility they have a
[2194.92 - 2200.60] responsibility to go deep into the small
[2197.68 - 2203.52] intestinal tract and start killing off
[2200.60 - 2205.56] bacteria and working with your immune
[2203.52 - 2209.00] system working with your lymphocytes
[2205.56 - 2213.00] monocytes nutrifil basophils basil B all
[2209.00 - 2214.60] of that working with that and so that's
[2213.00 - 2216.40] why it's important to really enhance and
[2214.60 - 2217.36] rebuild this you know that hydrochloric
[2216.40 - 2219.08] acid
[2217.36 - 2223.52] why on
[2219.08 - 2225.52] Instagram are people saying you know on
[2223.52 - 2228.00] on the medical medium Instagram their
[2225.52 - 2229.96] lives have changed and they've been
[2228.00 - 2232.44] everywhere they've done
[2229.96 - 2234.88] everything but their lives have changed
[2232.44 - 2236.48] because of this green celery juice and
[2234.88 - 2240.72] only celery juice that's sitting in
[2236.48 - 2242.92] their hand why is that happening and and
[2240.72 - 2244.68] how come nobody else knew that straight
[2242.92 - 2246.32] celery juice has the power to do this
[2244.68 - 2249.36] besides spirit because of spirit that's
[2246.32 - 2251.00] why that's why nobody knew Spirit knows
[2249.36 - 2252.24] I wouldn't even know I wouldn't know any
[2251.00 - 2254.36] of this I wouldn't know any of the
[2252.24 - 2256.40] information I've ever written about or
[2254.36 - 2259.04] put out there I wouldn't know a single
[2256.40 - 2261.96] piece of it if it wasn't for Spirit we
[2259.04 - 2263.40] know that you know it's Spirit people
[2261.96 - 2265.76] say you're the greatest someone said to
[2263.40 - 2267.52] me you're the greatest well I was out
[2265.76 - 2270.08] the other day cuz I I was forced to have
[2267.52 - 2271.96] to leave the leave the office and
[2270.08 - 2274.16] someone said you're hey you're you're
[2271.96 - 2275.76] you're Anthony I said yeah how you doing
[2274.16 - 2278.00] he said you're the greatest and I'm like
[2275.76 - 2280.48] no I'm not spirit is the greatest
[2278.00 - 2283.60] because really I don't know anything
[2280.48 - 2286.96] it's Spirit anyway the bottom line is
[2283.60 - 2290.04] that celery juice that celery juice is
[2286.96 - 2293.08] that powerful and it's life-changing
[2290.04 - 2294.08] because it builds up that structure okay
[2293.08 - 2296.40] I want to tell you something about the
[2294.08 - 2299.36] celery ju I never talked about when you
[2296.40 - 2302.60] buy celery you're you're buying
[2299.36 - 2305.04] different celery from different farms at
[2302.60 - 2306.84] different times of the year so when you
[2305.04 - 2309.64] go to the store and you're buying celery
[2306.84 - 2312.24] it's a different Farm it's not always
[2309.64 - 2316.16] the same farm and sometimes it's the
[2312.24 - 2318.88] same Farm growing celery in a new
[2316.16 - 2323.32] field or in a different
[2318.88 - 2326.32] field and it changes that mineral
[2323.32 - 2328.16] composition so what I'm saying is you're
[2326.32 - 2329.68] getting celery from a juice Place
[2328.16 - 2330.88] chances are the celery came from a
[2329.68 - 2333.04] different place this is a good thing
[2330.88 - 2335.72] this isn't a bad thing you're getting
[2333.04 - 2337.80] celery from your Co-op it's a good thing
[2335.72 - 2339.52] it's a different batch of celery you're
[2337.80 - 2341.04] getting you know from a different farm
[2339.52 - 2343.20] that was out in California shipped
[2341.04 - 2345.76] across the United States possibly a
[2343.20 - 2349.04] different one all this all this
[2345.76 - 2351.44] matters because celery juice has
[2349.04 - 2354.44] different compositions of mineral salts
[2351.44 - 2357.64] but all the same but different
[2354.44 - 2359.20] levels and that's the key to rebuilding
[2357.64 - 2360.60] the hydrochloric acid too if you could
[2359.20 - 2362.16] only have one celery and it's all you
[2360.60 - 2363.64] can get and it's one Farm only for the
[2362.16 - 2365.08] rest of your life then that's fine too
[2363.64 - 2367.68] believe me that'll also help move you
[2365.08 - 2370.28] forward and you'll heal
[2367.68 - 2374.44] so why is celery so important because
[2370.28 - 2378.28] that mineral blend was meant to actually
[2374.44 - 2380.40] restore those missing components out of
[2378.28 - 2381.96] your hydrochloric acid blend the seven
[2380.40 - 2384.44] blend remember I told you look out for
[2381.96 - 2385.24] seven look out for that number look out
[2384.44 - 2390.44] for
[2385.24 - 2392.68] seven seven is so profoundly powerful
[2390.44 - 2394.96] for so many reasons when it comes down
[2392.68 - 2396.76] to the human body and it comes down to
[2394.96 - 2399.48] the way things are structured in in the
[2396.76 - 2402.16] human body the way things are designed
[2399.48 - 2405.12] in the human body the way things are
[2402.16 - 2406.24] created and seven actually matters in so
[2405.12 - 2407.76] many different ways with the immune
[2406.24 - 2410.88] system with everything hydrochloric acid
[2407.76 - 2413.20] I can go on and on with the liver you
[2410.88 - 2414.72] you it's seven has a lot to do with
[2413.20 - 2417.92] what's happening in our bodies for that
[2414.72 - 2419.92] seven Hydrochloric blend to build back
[2417.92 - 2422.12] up and kill off and this is what happens
[2419.92 - 2426.60] the mineral salts are poisonous the
[2422.12 - 2429.20] mineral salts in celery are poisonous to
[2426.60 - 2432.64] bacteria they're poisonous not poisonous
[2429.20 - 2435.80] to you I promise you they rebuild that
[2432.64 - 2439.08] missing seven blend so the mineral salts
[2435.80 - 2441.84] in the celery rebuild the missing seven
[2439.08 - 2445.84] blend Hydrochloric acids that are
[2441.84 - 2448.64] combined in there that alone helps kill
[2445.84 - 2451.44] off any kind of SEO bacteria any kind of
[2448.64 - 2454.96] strep bacteria but it also enhances the
[2451.44 - 2457.52] immune system the immune system rides
[2454.96 - 2459.00] off of creating chemical compounds like
[2457.52 - 2461.20] I was just saying so your lymphocytes
[2459.00 - 2462.80] can create chemical compounds how do
[2461.20 - 2464.28] they create them what are they made out
[2462.80 - 2465.84] of what chemical compounds are we
[2464.28 - 2468.00] talking about I know I'm I know I'm
[2465.84 - 2470.52] going into some deep
[2468.00 - 2472.92] space but the chemical compounds are
[2470.52 - 2474.52] made out of salts made out of salts this
[2472.92 - 2475.72] doesn't mean you go run and start ding
[2474.52 - 2478.08] yourself with salt doesn't mean you
[2475.72 - 2479.56] start filling you start eating a ton of
[2478.08 - 2482.28] salt don't don't even do that that's not
[2479.56 - 2484.48] what I'm talking about talking about the
[2482.28 - 2487.28] celery and it's even some of it's even
[2484.48 - 2490.04] in the spinach stems so spin
[2487.28 - 2491.96] itself and and you know so those have
[2490.04 - 2494.44] you know sodium salts too that are
[2491.96 - 2498.44] special and designed in a special
[2494.44 - 2499.60] way so this type of these mineral salts
[2498.44 - 2502.88] that are in the
[2499.60 - 2505.48] celery they're used they're gathered by
[2502.88 - 2508.00] your white count that destroys sibo for
[2505.48 - 2510.60] good and moves it out of your body for
[2508.00 - 2512.24] good they utilize that because it what
[2510.60 - 2514.96] what your immune system cells what your
[2512.24 - 2518.00] immune cells can do is create chemical
[2514.96 - 2520.64] compounds devised devised out of those
[2518.00 - 2522.40] mineral salts from the celery science
[2520.64 - 2525.24] and research we're talking light years
[2522.40 - 2528.32] away from knowing that piece of it light
[2525.24 - 2529.60] years and but it's important to know
[2528.32 - 2531.04] that because you start looking for that
[2529.60 - 2532.20] you're not going to find that you start
[2531.04 - 2533.28] hopping on the internet you start
[2532.20 - 2535.28] looking for that you're not going to
[2533.28 - 2538.88] find
[2535.28 - 2540.04] that so the bottom line is we want to
[2538.88 - 2541.96] rebuild that up and you're doing that
[2540.04 - 2544.04] with celery that's one thing you can do
[2541.96 - 2545.88] but I'm giving you the information you
[2544.04 - 2547.84] guys I'm giving you this stuff so you
[2545.88 - 2549.24] know why you're getting better so you
[2547.84 - 2550.36] know why when you're on when you're
[2549.24 - 2551.64] doing the Instagram when you're seeing
[2550.36 - 2552.96] the Instagram you see somebody getting
[2551.64 - 2556.00] better so you know why things are
[2552.96 - 2557.52] happening this is one of the reasons
[2556.00 - 2559.76] because your immune system wants to kill
[2557.52 - 2563.72] every virus and every bacteria that we
[2559.76 - 2566.48] have in our body it just needs the right
[2563.72 - 2568.88] sodium salts or the right chemical salts
[2566.48 - 2570.88] meaning that are in chemical compounds
[2568.88 - 2573.32] that they can create new chemical
[2570.88 - 2574.80] compounds that are in vegetables and
[2573.32 - 2577.68] fruits I want to talk about fruit fear
[2574.80 - 2580.00] for a minute when it comes down to any
[2577.68 - 2581.48] type of problem someone thinks they have
[2580.00 - 2583.52] whether it's candida whether it's yeast
[2581.48 - 2585.32] whether it's mold whatever it is whether
[2583.52 - 2588.00] it's bacteria sibo they're told not to
[2585.32 - 2590.36] eat any fruit ever and it creates a
[2588.00 - 2592.80] fruit fear like no other you know I did
[2590.36 - 2595.20] a show on fruit fear you you guys know
[2592.80 - 2599.40] that I did a show and there's a chapter
[2595.20 - 2602.52] on fruit fear in medical medium book
[2599.40 - 2603.88] one and you know so I take you know you
[2602.52 - 2605.72] know I've taken it seriously but it's
[2603.88 - 2609.16] getting worse out there it's getting
[2605.72 - 2612.04] worse and worse and worse someone might
[2609.16 - 2614.84] say and argue hey look yeah but I got
[2612.04 - 2617.48] off of all my bad foods I even kept
[2614.84 - 2619.68] fruit out and got off of all my you know
[2617.48 - 2622.64] pizza and cheese and other stuff and I
[2619.68 - 2624.92] just eat a really clean clean clean diet
[2622.64 - 2627.04] some protein and some vegetables because
[2624.92 - 2629.28] a book out there says that that's going
[2627.04 - 2630.68] to be you know beneficial in some that's
[2629.28 - 2632.68] going to be beneficial and it's going to
[2630.68 - 2633.76] help you fight this and that and I felt
[2632.68 - 2636.80] better of course you're going to feel
[2633.76 - 2638.80] better because if you eat cleaner food
[2636.80 - 2641.00] you're going to feel better if you eat
[2638.80 - 2642.40] cleaner foods but if you're somebody
[2641.00 - 2644.56] that's really been struggling and
[2642.40 - 2646.76] suffering and been to every doctor tried
[2644.56 - 2648.84] everything and they're past that point
[2646.76 - 2650.36] not past that point of not healing I'm
[2648.84 - 2652.36] talking about past the point where
[2650.36 - 2654.72] they're not just like hey I finally got
[2652.36 - 2657.72] off of my fast food I finally got off of
[2654.72 - 2659.28] you know of of ice cream and I'm eating
[2657.72 - 2661.40] clean proteins and vegetables and I'm
[2659.28 - 2663.28] getting better if you're someone that's
[2661.40 - 2666.12] way P you know you're past that whole
[2663.28 - 2668.48] thing the fruit's critical because the
[2666.12 - 2671.36] fruit does matter the fruit really does
[2668.48 - 2673.24] matter cuz you take somebody who really
[2671.36 - 2675.04] needs the fruit and the right kind of
[2673.24 - 2678.12] foods and you take them and you put them
[2675.04 - 2680.04] on the kind of you know just clean diet
[2678.12 - 2682.60] that's out there that's minus fruit and
[2680.04 - 2684.08] Clean Diet that's out there and they're
[2682.60 - 2685.48] going to they're going to hit a wall
[2684.08 - 2686.84] they're going to hit a wall I've seen it
[2685.48 - 2688.20] happen for years and years and years
[2686.84 - 2691.20] what I'm saying is don't be afraid of
[2688.20 - 2692.52] fruit even if you're on a Clean Diet
[2691.20 - 2693.84] regardless of what that is is protein
[2692.52 - 2696.44] and vegetables whatever whether you're
[2693.84 - 2697.56] vegan you do doing vegan protein or
[2696.44 - 2700.60] you're a meat eater and you're doing
[2697.56 - 2702.36] meat protein whatever it is don't keep
[2700.60 - 2704.28] fruit out I've seen I've seen
[2702.36 - 2706.08] plant-based people vegan people say look
[2704.28 - 2708.08] I don't want to touch fruit I don't want
[2706.08 - 2710.04] to touch fruit ever I just don't like it
[2708.08 - 2712.92] bananas are bad everything's
[2710.04 - 2714.28] bad um and but I'm doing tons and tons
[2712.92 - 2716.64] of protein powders and tons of
[2714.28 - 2717.76] vegetables as a vegan they'll say same
[2716.64 - 2719.48] thing with you somebody who's a meat
[2717.76 - 2721.96] eater like no just you know lean cut
[2719.48 - 2724.08] animal protein and lots of vegetables
[2721.96 - 2726.72] don't keep the fruit out one of the
[2724.08 - 2729.08] reasons is the fruit kills
[2726.72 - 2731.96] the bacteria that causes
[2729.08 - 2735.44] sibo it kills
[2731.96 - 2736.88] it there's assets that are naturally in
[2735.44 - 2740.52] fruit fruit
[2736.88 - 2742.80] acids that dissolve bacteria sometimes
[2740.52 - 2744.64] it's why people some people be like well
[2742.80 - 2746.56] I kind of feel like I'm detoxing and I
[2744.64 - 2749.48] eat a lot of fruit because you are
[2746.56 - 2751.96] detoxing you are detoxing detoxing for
[2749.48 - 2754.76] the first time in your life
[2751.96 - 2756.44] actually and that's how critical fruit
[2754.76 - 2758.56] is like bananas
[2756.44 - 2759.40] yeah bananas bananas are now becoming
[2758.56 - 2761.88] the
[2759.40 - 2763.44] Antichrist literally the Antichrist
[2761.88 - 2765.64] because of
[2763.44 - 2768.52] practitioners that are writing books
[2765.64 - 2770.88] that are influenced by information that
[2768.52 - 2774.24] came out about 8 nine years ago that was
[2770.88 - 2778.16] never even lab created
[2774.24 - 2781.20] information it was a poisonous Theory
[2778.16 - 2784.12] came out for a reason to stop you from
[2781.20 - 2786.60] ever eating a banana again to stop you
[2784.12 - 2788.32] from ever eating certain fruits again
[2786.60 - 2791.20] this is contaminated
[2788.32 - 2793.84] information that certain famous people
[2791.20 - 2796.28] well-known people have made sure they
[2793.84 - 2799.52] got it into the alternative system about
[2796.28 - 2802.16] 9 10 years ago I remember when it
[2799.52 - 2804.80] happened and don't get poisoned by that
[2802.16 - 2806.60] information don't be afraid of eating a
[2804.80 - 2810.32] banana something very important what
[2806.60 - 2812.40] does the banana do it grabs on to
[2810.32 - 2814.16] sibo and look if you're somebody that
[2812.40 - 2815.92] says oh I don't know if it's streping me
[2814.16 - 2819.20] but I got sibo and the doctor said that
[2815.92 - 2822.12] I got lots of bacteria then a banana is
[2819.20 - 2824.48] that powerful it can grab onto that
[2822.12 - 2826.36] bacteria and pull it out it doesn't feed
[2824.48 - 2830.00] the bacteria it kills the bacteria
[2826.36 - 2834.04] suffocates it pulls it out something to
[2830.00 - 2836.12] know so all fruit is good all vegetables
[2834.04 - 2837.24] are good I'm just saying so don't be
[2836.12 - 2839.44] afraid of different fruits the fruit
[2837.24 - 2842.48] fear is so out of control now that it's
[2839.44 - 2845.92] I I honestly can't even battle it
[2842.48 - 2848.28] anymore out there I need I need you guys
[2845.92 - 2850.36] to actually stick up for some fruit and
[2848.28 - 2853.44] you do that you do that I see it happens
[2850.36 - 2854.84] out there um leafy greens vegetables we
[2853.44 - 2856.76] need all of that let's talk about some
[2854.84 - 2858.28] herbs and things I want to talk about
[2856.76 - 2859.80] how to kill the strep inside of you
[2858.28 - 2862.88] that's creating the
[2859.80 - 2865.56] sio so rosemary thyme Sage oregano
[2862.88 - 2868.20] parsley cilantro you know the Rosemary
[2865.56 - 2870.96] th Sage I'm going to say it again
[2868.20 - 2873.72] oregano parsley cilantro the simple
[2870.96 - 2875.72] herbs that we have in food all the time
[2873.72 - 2878.36] make sure you're using them that kills
[2875.72 - 2881.36] kills off sibo that kills off small
[2878.36 - 2884.20] intestinal tract bacteria such as strep
[2881.36 - 2887.28] it destroys it make sure that you're
[2884.20 - 2889.84] using that when you can a little time
[2887.28 - 2891.52] fresh time is fine time tea you know
[2889.84 - 2895.04] about that right talk about it all the
[2891.52 - 2897.20] time I talk about it all the time Sage
[2895.04 - 2899.40] have sage in your food sprinkle it in
[2897.20 - 2900.52] chop a little sage leaf fresh sage leaf
[2899.40 - 2902.28] in there whether it's cooked food

[3056.32 - 3059.40] strep doesn't take over especially when
[3057.96 - 3062.28] it comes to other things that strep
[3059.40 - 3065.00] creates besides siba which is UTI pelvic

[3071.16 - 3075.64] so all of these things are that
[3073.80 - 3077.60] important also zinc because you're
[3075.64 - 3079.80] battling strep so you do want zinc in
[3077.60 - 3081.92] your system so that's another thing too
[3079.80 - 3085.92] the liquid sink I always talk
[3081.92 - 3089.88] about and um and the B12 and the B 12 is
[3085.92 - 3091.40] important too Elderberry so elderberry
[3089.88 - 3094.64] tea you can get the Elderberry
[3091.40 - 3096.68] elderberry tea is a great one for sibo
[3094.64 - 3098.12] if anybody's into chocolate terrible for
[3096.68 - 3100.40] sibo one of the worst things in the
[3098.12 - 3102.40] world for sibo so I'm just saying if you
[3100.40 - 3103.92] don't have sibo and you love chocolate
[3102.40 - 3106.68] hey don't let anything stand in your way
[3103.92 - 3108.36] I'm just saying if you got small
[3106.68 - 3109.84] intestinal over overgrowth you know
[3108.36 - 3111.72] diagnosis that you the bacterial
[3109.84 - 3115.20] overgrowth diagnosis that has been given
[3111.72 - 3116.72] to you stay away from chocolate if you
[3115.20 - 3118.84] have have that
[3116.72 - 3120.32] diagnosis stay away from chocolate you
[3118.84 - 3121.68] can have a little bit if you're really
[3120.32 - 3124.68] into it you can have a little bit here
[3121.68 - 3126.12] and there but C cut it back some people
[3124.68 - 3127.76] eat a ton of it they have it every
[3126.12 - 3130.80] single day so I'm worried about that if
[3127.76 - 3134.04] someone has an issue that that's too
[3130.80 - 3136.28] much there's many more supplements and
[3134.04 - 3138.96] and foods you can do and incorporate to
