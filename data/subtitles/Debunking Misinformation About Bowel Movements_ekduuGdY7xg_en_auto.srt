this an important live about poop

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,480
because everybody

32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,800
looks in the toilet after they go

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,000
very few people on the planet

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
don't look

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
behind them

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
after they've gone okay

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
everybody looks that's what they do they

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,000
get up and they look those down in there

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,159
like yeah looks pretty good

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
and so what happens is that

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,600
like poops everything to everybody for

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
so many reasons you know we don't talk

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
about it we don't want to talk about it

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
we're embarrassed to talk about it

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
at the same time every time you go to

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
your doctor physician your your health

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,119
care provider whatever it is they're

48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,119
always asking questions people are

49
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,640
always concerned their stomach problems

50
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
everything else so it's kind of

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
important in so many different ways good

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439

60
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,200
is

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,360
questions that are well that's not what

62
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
i learned in school aw hey that's not

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
what i learned

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
or that's not what i learned in training

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
or that's not what i was taught in the

66
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,240
medical field don't listen to this man

67
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,080
because he doesn't know anything

68
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
and you know that's i love when that

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
happens because i see that happen all

70
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,920
the time right it doesn't matter how

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
many people got better at medical mean

72
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
information doesn't matter the medical

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,760
medium information it's the first in

74
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
chronic illness to change the rules out

75
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,440
there where people are healing

76
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
rapidly all around the world that

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,959
doesn't matter not of that right just

78
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
know um you learn something about poop

79
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,680
that's misinformation you hold on to

80
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,160
that for the rest of your life and you

81
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,480
think you're you're solid

82
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
so the point is is that questions come

83
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
about and it's like okay

84
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,319
i always heard that when a poop floats

85
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,680
then you're in trouble a healthy poop

86
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,879
sinks

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
that's what people say a healthy poop

88
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,040
sinks

89
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
up unhealthy poop

90
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,840
floats right so that's what people are

91
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
trained to think or trained to know

92
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,280
but you got to think about i said this

93
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,000
before all the people dying

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
all the hospitals filled with very ill

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
people

96
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,959
okay and their poops all sink

97
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,959
there's people that are dying

98
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,680
only got a couple weeks to live

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
and their poops are sinking

100
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,760
so

101
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,159
it's not that the person's poop is

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,400
perfectly healthy and fine but they're

103
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,879
gonna die in two weeks

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
so they're unhealthy they're obviously

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
dying they're very ill

106
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
okay but their poop is healthy

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
everything about their poop is healthy

108
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
it sinks it's healthy you got to think

109
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,959
about that for a minute there right

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
understand what that means

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
and how it works okay sun moon love says

112
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760

113
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,680

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
anymore because we're talking about poop

good to see everybody all right so what

133

happens is the misinformation is really

134
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,680
rampant out there about poop

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
you can have people dying

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
sick

137
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960

138
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,479
intestinal tract all kinds of different

139
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
disorders different conditions and their

140
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,120
poop will sink

141
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,199
it'll sink

142
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,040
it will and that's what happens and

143
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
people don't realize this

144
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,199
michael scoots good to see people don't

145
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,400
realize this that that's what happens

146
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,080
and so you can what i talk to nurses all

147
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
through the years i've talked to doctors

148
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
and they'll tell you i know like i was

149
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
talking about this in amazon life friend

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
of mine is an emergency room doctor

151
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
right

152
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
and he's dealing with the sickest people

153
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,919
on the planet rolling in just rolling in

154
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
right deathly ill

155
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
their poop sinks

156
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,759
so now the person's sick

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
the person's dying

158
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,840
the person has organ failure but their

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,199
poops are

160
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,560
healthy does that make any sense to you

161
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,880
it doesn't make any sense that's the

162
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
whole point now think about this

163
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,400
millions of people

164
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,400
in the u.s alone over 275

165
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
million americans are sick

166
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
yes

167
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,479
275 million americans are sick you guys

168
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,680
with symptoms and conditions

169
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
some gravely sick some just moderately

170
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
sick

171
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
some partly sick and their poop all

172
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
sinks

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,479
i don't think

174
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
we can just confidently say

175
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
right

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
that if a poop sinks it's great and

177
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,280
that's what we've been taught you got to

178
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,720
think about that

179
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,120
275 million americans alone i'm not good

180
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
about worldwide

181
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
billions of people on the planet their

182
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
poop sinks

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
billions are sick with symptoms and

184
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
conditions so we have to we have to kind

185
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
of like take a look at that to begin

186
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,600
with and see how that works and nothing

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
makes sense holly's health says nothing

188
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,919
in the medical system makes sense true

189
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
very little does

190
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,039
so let's get into this a little bit so

191
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
here's the deal if your poop floats

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
that means you must have pancreatic

193
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
cancer that means you're not digesting

194
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
your fats

195
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,759
that means it must be all fat in your

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560
poop right that's the misinformation so

197
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
that's the part that's the

198
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
misinformation

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,560
okay

200
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,280
right

201
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,160
so that's that part there is wait a

202
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
minute

203
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,039
if your poop floats you're sick

204
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
you're sick

205
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
it's interesting someone dying in the

206
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
hospital

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,919
organ failure and every other problem

208
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
right really sick on tons of medications

209
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,240
everything else their poop sinks to the

210
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
bottom of the toilet they're not sick

211
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
someone who doesn't exhibit one symptom

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,919
their poop floats all of a sudden

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
they're the one dying

214
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,039
think about that so that's why this

215
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
misinformation is so

216
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,240
basically

217
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
filled with so many different aspects of

218
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
it that we're going to cover and go

219
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,960
through that are just perplexing in so

220
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
many ways so let's go into that a little

221
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
bit guys so we're talking about poop i

222
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,560
want to grab a glass here with water

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,720
okay

224
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
so the misinformation out there is if

225
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
your poop floats

226
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,960
that means you're sick

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,360
very unhealthy unwell

228
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
you're not digesting your food right

229
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
and all the fat is floating to the

230
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
surface that's what we're taught right

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
there okay

232
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
but you got to remember

233
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
you're being taught that from

234
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,039
the industry both medical communities

235
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
both alternative and conventional that

236
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
don't know why anybody's sick and don't

237
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
know why anybody got sick

238
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,360
that's how it's always been that's why

239
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
people go to doctor to doctorate mystery

240
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,720
symptoms and they never find any answers

241
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
so we're taught that by those guys right

242
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,160
even functional medicine doctors we're

243
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,680
taught that by them that's great but

244
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
there are people that have been to a lot

245
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,919
of functional medicine doctors and still

246
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
didn't heal until they found mm info

247
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
and that's why functional medicine

248
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,759
doctors now use mm info but the point is

249
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,240
is let's go into how it works your stool

250
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
floating or stool sinking now i said the

251
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,360
healthiest stool

252
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,360
is a stool that's

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,759
mid-floating poop that's mid-floating

254
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
it's okay if your poop sinks if you're

255
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
eating really healthy and you're doing

256
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
you're working on your healing process

257
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
you've got a good diet and your poop

258
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,759
sinks that's okay

259
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,680
when you eventually get so healthy and

260
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
your liver heals and everything cleans

261
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
up your poop will start to float a

262
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,640
little bit your poop will start going

263
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,959
mid mid float like a mid float there's a

264
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,519
reason for that one reason is because

265
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,560
you're absorbing every last little bit

266
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,800
of fat

267
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,440
every last little bit of protein and

268
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,440
fats being utilized and absorbed and

269
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
when all your fat and your protein gets

270
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
utilized and absorbed you guys your

271
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,440
stool starts to mid float it starts to

272
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
take a little bit of elevation it starts

273
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
to float a little bit this is so

274
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
important to know right here

275
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,720
so

276
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,680
so we have to understand something when

277
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
you're

278
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,519
digestive system is so sharp your

279
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
liver's literally breaking down every

280
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,040
bit of that fat and it's going into your

281
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
bloodstream

282
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,360
right your stomach's breaking down every

283
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
bit of that protein breaking it down to

284
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
nothing

285
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
right

286
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
but what's going to be left in your

287
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
stool you guys

288
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,440
is fiber

289
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,160
fiber floats

290
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,720
fiber and pulp

291
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
will float so you have to know that it's

292
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,839
important to know

293
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,640
that will float

294
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
so let's take a banana right

295
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
a banana

296
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,279
is a lot of sugar like we know right

297
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
that's your sugar it's banana okay so

298
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,800
i'll put a piece of banana in here right

299
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
you'll see the banana float

300
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,760
your banana isn't an overt fat it

301
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
doesn't have a lot of protein in it it

302
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,519
doesn't have a lot of fat in it notice

303
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
it's floating

304
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,920
and pouring it out let's take a lemon

305
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
now all right

306
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,279
so let's take a lemon next let's do a

307
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,880
lemon slice right here okay a lemon

308
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,600
is pulp

309
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,680
fiber right

310
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
and your lemon's floating

311
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
see how it works

312
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
so that's your lemon

313
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
it's floating

314
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
okay

315
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,640
so what happens is

316
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,399
that there's no overt fat in here

317
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
so everybody keeps on saying well it's

318
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
fat that floats it's fat that floats

319
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
that's why you're sick it's fat that

320
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,440
floats it's that that's not true that's

321
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,760
not entirely true we're gonna go we're

322
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,600
gonna go through all of this okay

323
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,680
nature's gift said or that is made up of

324
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
mostly water and air not true

325
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480
there's no air in a banana

326
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,360
so

327
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,000
you're wrong i'm sorry

328
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,399
there's no air in a banana

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,160
very important to know okay

330
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,519
there's no air

331
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,760
inside the lemon

332
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,600
there's no space for air and there's no

333
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,640
air inside of a lemon it is liquid pulp

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
fiber

335
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
pith

336
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
pectin

337
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,240
and all of that floats

338
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
very important to know right

339
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,279
so i know you don't like to be debunked

340
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
i get it you don't like to be debunked

341
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,519
no one likes to be debunked they don't

342
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
it's another reason why a lot of people

343
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,360
in the field of medicine don't like

344
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
medical medium because they hate being

345
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
debunked over and over and over again

346
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
they look like a fool and then they

347
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,880
don't know what to do and they're like

348
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,000
oh my god we've been wrong let's take a

349
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,279
cucumber slice now okay

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,519
so i got a cucumber slice in here

351
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,760
cucumber's floating

352
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,680
so i thought that means you're dying if

353
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
your stool floats so if you're somebody

354
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,600
that eats lots of fruits lots of

355
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
vegetables lots of leafy greens lots of

356
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
wild foods

357
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200
and your stool floats

358
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
you're dying

359
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
does that make any sense

360
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,320
see

361
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,920
this is important information so i i i

362
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
would i would recommend re-watching this

363
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,079
live i really would because we're going

364
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
to cover this like

365
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,920
all through it right so let's go a

366
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,839
little bit more celery

367
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
there's no air in celery okay

368
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
it's no air and celery

369
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,079
celery's floating

370
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
right

371
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
see

372
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
there's no fat

373
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,000
in the celery there's no fat in the

374
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,839
cucumber there's no fat in the lemon

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,720
there's no fat in the banana it's not an

376
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,600
overt fat why is it all floating and

377
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,279
there's no gas in here

378
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,959
you guys

379
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,959
there is no gas in here

380
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,519
you can't say that a stool that floats

381
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
because it's made out of pith fiber

382
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
pectin

383
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,920
and pulp

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,440
you can't say that there's gas in there

385
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,440
that's not how it works fiber floats all

386
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
these things float you see how it works

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,519
your diet

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,560
when it's high in all of this you get a

389
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,560
mid-floating poop and a floating poop

390
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
and it's the healthiest poop you can

391
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,399
ever get and i'll tell you why

392
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,079
see

393
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
let's go into a little bit more on y and

394
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,680
everything so here we are

395
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
so right now if you guys just came on

396
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
here i'm going to read some questions

397
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
about poop we're part of the poop this

398
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,639
is part of the poopathon i've been

399
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
promising

400
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
i hope i can deliver there's lots of fun

401
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
stuff to talk about about poop so let's

402
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,040
go let's get into it a little bit so i

403
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,440
got another glass right here

404
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
all right

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
we all know chocolate's high in fat

406
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
if

407
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
fat is why your poop is floating because

408
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,880
you're not digesting any fat and you're

409
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,800
thinking oh well a sick poop is

410
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,519
undigested fat and that's just what the

411
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,519
way it goes let's take a look here

412
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
i'm gonna put some chocolate in here

413
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,639
the chocolate sinks to the bottom like a

414
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,279
rock just like your poop

415
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
just like your it just goes down to

416
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
the bottom

417
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
see how it works

418
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
when you eat a diet

419
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
with a chocolate bar in it it's going to

420
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,240
sink to the bottom

421
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,040
when you poo it out because your poop is

422
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,480
going to be filled with fat

423
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,240
and protein

424
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
when fat is in your poop it sinks to the

425
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,720
bottom of the toilet everybody has a

426
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
weak liver people dying in the hospital

427
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
have weak and dysfunctional livers

428
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,639
there's people dying in the hospital

429
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,160
with liver with liver um

430
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,040
failure

431
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,800
and they can't digest any of their fat

432
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,440
but their poop is stuck to the bottom of

433
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,440
the toilet

434
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
i know so

435
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,880
i talked to a lot of patients i talked

436
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
to a lot of doctors

437
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,839
and that happens you can have liver

438
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,000
failure and your poops all float to the

439
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,199
bottom of the toilet

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,920
so let's do some more different

441
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
chocolate here we got some chocolate

442
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,560
chips all these chocolate chips are

443
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,920
sinking to the bottom of the toilet

444
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
see

445
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,959
that's right

446
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
like that

447
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
that's how it goes so i'm dropping all

448
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,079
those chocolate chips down into the

449
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
bottom and there they are

450
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,560
right

451
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,560
let's do another little test too so

452
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,639
let's let's let's keep on testing we'll

453
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,759
have some more fun here right let's go

454
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,079
with some cashews right

455
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,079
dropping some cashews in here too

456
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,959
they're all going down

457
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,320
to the bottom they're all sinking

458
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,959
now cashews have air in them you have to

459
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,639
break the cashew open because they

460
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,839
actually have an air pocket like a

461
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,320
balloon

462
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,720
so if you put a whole cashew in it might

463
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
fall it might float but what happens you

464
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
need to know is that when you let the

465
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,519
air out because you'll see in the middle

466
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,240
of a cashew you have a pocket in there

467
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,480
it's hollow cashews are actually hollow

468
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,199
they're filled with air

469
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,120
it's important to know

470
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,360
so when you break the cashew in half

471
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,399
you'll notice they all sink

472
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
because

473
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
that's what fat does

474
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
it sinks

475
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,800
right that's the fat that everybody's

476
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,040
eating so let's go into a couple more

477
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,120
things let's do this

478
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,839
we're going to do some almonds too

479
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,279
almonds are sinking see

480
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,440
here's how it works everybody

481
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
if they all had their stools

482
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
analyzed right and profiles were done on

483
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
how much fat and proteins in their

484
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
stools

485
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,680
it would be loaded with lots of fat

486
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
that's why their poops are sinking it's

487
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,800
too the fats not being broken down or

488
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,040
digested this is an unhealthy sign this

489
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
means that people living their lives the

490
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
whole world is pooping and it's sinking

491
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,639
to the bottom of the toilet the whole

492
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,639
world's getting sick

493
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,399
and everybody's poop sinks because

494
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
everybody's poops are filled with

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,360
digestive problems they've digested

496
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,079
problems and their poops are filled with

497
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
undigested fat and protein see

498
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
so when you eat a whole bunch of almond

499
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,880
butter you're not breaking all the

500
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
almond butter down so what's happening

501
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
is your almond butter is being pooped

502
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,400
out and that puts the smear on the

503
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,400
toilet

504
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,799
that puts the smear

505
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
on the toilet

506
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,880
right in there in the basin right that's

507
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,839
that slimy smear

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,000
that's avocado that's chocolate that's

509
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,320
yes chocolate that's nut butter that's

510
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,799
tahini peanut butter that's all of that

511
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,799
is being smeared there if you're only on

512
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,320
bananas you're not going to get a smear

513
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,320
in the toilet

514
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,760
your poop will probably float if you're

515
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,559
only on banana after a while

516
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
daisy says not true i'm not sure who

517
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,880
she's saying not true to

518
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,880
but that's a daisy saying

519
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
so i have an egg right here

520
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,559
an egg

521
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,039
is high in fat this is why doctors for

522
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,320
many years said be cautious about eggs

523
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,440
because it'll bring you to a heart

524
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,039
attack

525
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
and then the egg industry pays for all

526
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,880
these you know new ads and new studies

527
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,960
and everything to try to get people to

528
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
start eating eggs again and so the whole

529
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
propaganda and everybody thinks eggs are

530
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,280
healthy and then you know against

531
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,200
sane advice that you eat too many eggs

532
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,559
yeah you'll get a buildup of fat inside

533
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
your heart and arteries

534
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
and cardiovascular system and you'll be

535
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
set up for a stroke heart attack or

536
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,559
whatever

537
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,400
yeah

538
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,280
right

539
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
so

540
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
there's a question right there daisy

541
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,840
says are you unhealthy and my poop my

542
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
poop is never sinking right

543
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
and i'm going to cover that

544
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
you can have gastritis and have a lot of

545
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,280
gas

546
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,520
and your poop can float from lots of gas

547
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,640
from a from a digestive system that's

548
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,320
also struggling

549
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
but

550
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,240
everybody in a hospital in every single

551
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
hospital in the united states and and

552
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,760
abroad or anywhere else right overseas

553
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,520
or whatever they're in the hospital

554
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,320
their poops are sinking they're sick as

555
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,440
dogs most those people and their poop is

556
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
sinking

557
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,760
i got an egg right here right i'ma drop

558
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,720
an egg in here

559
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,679
okay

560
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
so i just put an egg in this

561
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,520
that egg sunk to the bottom is what that

562
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,760
egg did

563
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,400
so people eat eggs every day

564
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,720
that egg is high in fat

565
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,600
and here's with something interesting

566
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
that egg has air in it too

567
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,280
and look how heavy

568
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,200
the fat is

569
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,679
and the protein is in that egg look how

570
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
heavy eggs eggs are really high in fat

571
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,320
okay

572
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,840
that's sunk to the bottom see that egg

573
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,360
when people eat eggs and they're

574
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,480
undigested and they don't realize it

575
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,880
their poop sinks to the bottom of the

576
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,640
toilet i'm trying to tell you guys when

577
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,640
your digestive system is not sharp

578
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,840
feezy says okay that's true i have gas

579
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,600
issues

580
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,120
yeah of course of course thank you for

581
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,559
saying that

582
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,000
some people they just won't say anything

583
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,440
back they'll just be like you're wrong

584
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,960
so thank you it's really kind of you

585
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,320
actually

586
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,880
and so you have to understand here even

587
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,480
with air inside that egg that egg sinks

588
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,159
to the bottom

589
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,120
so that's important to know

590
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
okay

591
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,960
so

592
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,280
what i'm gonna do is

593
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
some of you might doubt that that's not

594
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,840
a real egg and i i actually understand

595
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,720
that okay so let me get this out here

596
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
all right

597
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,400
some of you might doubt that that's real

598
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,400
egg so and i don't blame you really

599
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,480
so i just dumped the water on i got the

600
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
egg right here

601
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
okay

602
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,720
so

603
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,159
that's a real egg

604
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,360
hope you can see that egg in there and

605
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
that's the egg yolk right there

606
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,559
see if you can see that just just

607
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000

608
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
have

609
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,880
props and stuff you're thinking well

610
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe that's just a prop but no that's a

611
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,840
real egg

612
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,799

almond butter

621
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,520
there's oil just rolling around on the

622
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,240
top it's not butter right why is he

623
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
wearing gloves

624
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
what do you mean

625
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,360
do i want raw egg all over the board i

626
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,720
don't just i don't feel like dying i

627
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
don't feel like killing a family member

628
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
tonight

629
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
family member comes in here and starts

630
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,159
using my cutting board with raw egg all

631
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
over my cutting board and starts to make

632
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,520
themselves a snack maybe they chop up

633
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,120
some cucumber slices up or something

634
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,960
like that and they get that raw egg on

635
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,799
the cucumber that's the last thing i

636
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,120
want god forbid they end up in the

637
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,000
hospital salmonella you guys gotta

638
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,000
remember you leave your egg salad in the

639
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,159
sun for five seconds they say you can

640
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,080
die

641
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,159
they say you can't leave your potato

642
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,360
salad or egg salad with mayonnaise which

643
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,760
is egg you can't leave it outside of

644
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
like room temperature or on a picnic

645
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,280
table too long they say you're gonna get

646
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,480
sick and you're gonna end up dead

647
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,480
there's a reason for that

648
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,039
i know people

649
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,600
two people that died at a table in a

650
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,440
restaurant from salmonella they never

651
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,919
made it to the hospital in time they

652
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,159
literally died at the table

653
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,039
at the table

654
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,960
and then

655
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,559
if you don't cook your chicken

656
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,799
thoroughly

657
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,360
you can die

658
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,039
isn't that crazy so yeah okay i got a

659
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,039
glove on while i'm cracking open an egg

660
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
so that's almond butter right there it's

661
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,440
sunk right to the bottom

662
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
almond butter when you have a tablespoon

663
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
of almond butter

664
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
your poop will sink to the bottom

665
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
because the almond butter won't be fully

666
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
digested because everybody has a weak

667
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
liver stagnant sluggish liver the liver

668
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
is not working good

669
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,120
and their hydrochloric acid is not

670
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,960
strong so unhealthy poops it sinks to

671
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,200
the bottom so your almond butter ends up

672
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,840
going to the bottom your eggs end up

673
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,799
going to the bottom you see how it works

674
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,240
all of that goes to the bottom

675
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,240
same thing with peanut butter right here

676
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
smith and pepper says i have tons of

677
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,799
digestive issues and health issues and

678
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
my poop sinks for sure

679
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
absolutely

680
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
because you can have celiac crohn's

681
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
colitis and your poop sinks to the

682
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,679
bottom then why is everybody saying it's

683
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,679
a healthy poop

684
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,640
see where the misinformation is but it

685
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
takes it takes

686
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,360
a real

687
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,679
like awakening to know how the system is

688
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,240
so corrupted and and backwards with

689
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,760
everything just everything so let's go

690
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,679
into some questions right

691
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,919
here's one right here show me the

692
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,279
research that states floating poop is

693
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
linked to positive health and not

694
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,039
dysfunction i will wait

695
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
right

696
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
oh you'll wait

697
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,000
just like all the other people with

698
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,440
chronic illness for the last 30 40 years

699
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that waited for 10 years 20 years

700
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,159
how to get their thyroid removed

701
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,679
no research to help them

702
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,279
all the people with

703
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,360
severe chronic fatigue syndrome and

704
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,559
neurological disorders

705
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,080
they waited

706
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,240
everybody with lupus and multiple

707
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,000
sclerosis they waited

708
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
everybody waited and went to 20 30

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,760
doctors so you'll wait too okay good i'm

710
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,120
glad you weighed

711
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
so let's take a look here i got a

712
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,120
question right here

713
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
being sarcastic

714
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
anthony i'm not saying that i disagree

715
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,120
with you because i believe in your

716
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,799
information

717
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
all i'm saying

718
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,080
is this

719
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,679
instead of using peanut butter tahini

720
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
nuts for your experiment why didn't you

721
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,760
use a spoonful of butter drizzles of any

722
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,840
oil spoonful of lard

723
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,520
a spoonful of straight cholesterol you

724
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,320
will find that those all things those

725
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,080
float i agree with you that if you have

726
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,760
a high fiber diet your stools are going

727
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,159
to float more than sink and i understand

728
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,840
your reasoning you can still have a high

729
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,440
fiber diet but if you're eating that

730
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,279
peanut butter and then almond butter and

731
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,960
that fat and all that other stuff that

732
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,240
i'm saying poop's going to sink to the

733
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,240
bottom even with a high fiber diet

734
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,120
so i agree with you that if you have a

735
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
high fiber diet your stools are going to

736
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,159
float more than sink and i understand

737
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,559
your reasoning and i appreciate your

738
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,559
teaching but blocked bile ducts and gall

739
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,880
stones can cause a fatty stool or

740
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,720
malabsorption of fat not peanut butter

741
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,640
fat

742
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,600
so peanut butter fat won't float

743
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
but

744
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,559
some other fat will

745
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,559
here's how it works okay

746
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,760
what happens is people that have

747
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
digestive problems in their and their

748
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,039
poop floats just because they have a

749
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,200
black bile duct their poop's not

750
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,440
floating because the fat's not

751
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,440
undigested because of a blocked bile

752
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,080
duct their poops floating because

753
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,440
they're sick with a ton of gas what

754
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,520
happens is this would you have

755
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,760
pancreatitis or pancreatic problems or

756
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
pancreatic duct problems or any kind of

757
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,559
duct problem even pancreatic cancer the

758
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,559
reason why your poop floats is because

759
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,960
your entire intestinal tract is filled

760
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,720
with a ton of gas because your liver and

761
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,039
your pancreas are failing to break down

762
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
and digest stuff so what's happening is

763
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,039
your

764
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,200
stool is all gas people with pancreatic

765
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,919
disease pancreatic cancer block bile

766
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,840
ducts have the worst stream in gastritis

767
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,480
where it's air that comes out non-stop

768
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,159
where it's pouring out non-stop now

769
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,679
someone may not have that experience of

770
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
knowing how that works but i actually

771
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,200
know how that works and i've seen this

772
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,960
so over and over again i've known people

773
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,559
with pancreatic cancer known lots of

774
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,320
them hundreds of them over the years i

775
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,640
talk doctors about lots of patients with

776
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,480
the same thing the gas streams out of

777
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
them and pours out of them and that gas

778
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,200
fills the stool and that's what makes

779
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
the stool float

780
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,720
important enough so now i'm going to

781
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,480
talk about something else within this

782
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
question just so you know so let's go

783
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,640
into so what this person is saying right

784
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
and i respect this person's question

785
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,919
question it's great

786
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,840
they're saying why aren't you trying

787
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
large so let's try other oil

788
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,960
let's try butter

789
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,600
so anthony why aren't you using butter

790
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,039
i'll tell you why i'm not using butter

791
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,559
right

792
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,559
i got some butter in here and you'll see

793
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,000
the butter float so that's a step this

794
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,240
is a stick of butter

795
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,679
right

796
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
okay

797
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,320
and the butter floats

798
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
right

799
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:37,840
but people eat that much butter on their

800
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:40,720
pancakes every day and their poop sinks

801
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,720
people eat butter in their food they put

802
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,840
butter on their chicken their poop

803
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,679
stinks and it sinks

804
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,600
people put butter in their food and

805
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,520
their poops all sink

806
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,559
all these people eating butter their

807
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,799
poop sinks every day because no one's

808
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,120
just eating butter

809
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:03,279
no one is just eating a whole stick of

810
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,880
butter sure if you eat ready for this

811
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,960
if you eat whole sticks of butter

812
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,320
like one whole stick of butter two whole

813
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
sticks of butter and three whole sticks

814
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,279
of butter in a day

815
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,799
and you poop butter straight out it's

816
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:22,159
still not going to float even though it

817
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,520
floats as butter here it won't float

818
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,600
after you've gone to bathroom

819
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,880
if you eat three sticks of butter in a

820
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,720
day the sticks of butter are gonna

821
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
collect other little bits of debris in

822
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,279
your intestinal tract anyway it's gonna

823
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,000
come out as butter because you're over

824
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,399
you're eating just butter and it's gonna

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,399
sink

826
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,960
and that's what people don't realize

827
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,039
if you eat just butter people aren't

828
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,799
eating just butter anyway no one's

829
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,279
eating three sticks four sticks of

830
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,000
butter no one's just downing a whole ton

831
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,960
of butter that's not what they're doing

832
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,880
but if you do down a lot of butter like

833
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,559
three sticks four sticks of butter your

834
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,200
poop's not gonna float your poop's still

835
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,200
gonna sink

836
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,480
the reason why i'm not using butter as a

837
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,600
poop tested here having it float is

838
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,720
because no one eats more than that much

839
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,240
butter and that butter in their poo

840
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,840
still

841
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,840
sinks to the bottom of the toilet

842
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,600
see how it works

843
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,799
so

844
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,440
no one's eating just straight fat by

845
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,320
itself now here's a pure example of this

846
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,240
if you drink a bottle of olive oil most

847
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,880
of the olive oil that goes into the

848
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,080
toilet will sink it'll wrap up with

849
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
little bits of

850
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,760
debris that's in your intestinal tract

851
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
and all the oil will be in globules and

852
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
it'll sink to the bottom of the toilet

853
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,880
but a little bit of olive oil will

854
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,520
surface so you'll still see some

855
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,559
surfacing to the top but nobody drinks a

856
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,080
whole bottle of olive oil nobody eats

857
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,159
sticks and sticks of butter by

858
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,520
themselves on their own they have a

859
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,799
little butter on their pancakes their

860
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,240
waffles they have a little butter on

861
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,600
their steak but their poops are still

862
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,440
sinking to the bottom of the toilet and

863
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
there's still butter in their stool

864
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,159
here's the interesting thing if you get

865
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,240
a stool test they'll find butter fat in

866
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,760
the poop that sunk to the bottom along

867
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,760
with the steak and everything else they

868
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,760
ate

869
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,240
so i want to answer a couple more

870
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,320
questions too

871
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,320
karen burkett says i've been doing mmm

872
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,159
for six months now religiously my poops

873
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,919
still sink yeah and i said this last

874
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,120
time too

875
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,440
okay

876
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,600
inside our guts right

877
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,559
this is important to know

878
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,559
inside our guts

879
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,240
we have

880
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,960
lots of debris stuck to the inside of

881
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,559
our guts first of all karen

882
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
when someone says they've been doing mm

883
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,240
for six months i don't know what that

884
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,480
means it could be dabbling and no

885
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,679
offense i i'm honored you're doing it

886
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,440
i'm happy you're doing it for your

887
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
health but karen

888
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
is it dabbling

889
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
are you doing the mono cleanse for six

890
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,799
months

891
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
are you doing the 369 advance for six

892
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,600
months are you doing the heavy metal

893
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,679
detox movie and the 369 are you doing 32

894
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,600
ounces of celery juice heavy metal detox

895
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,960
lui 369

896
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,559
are you doing the are you doing the

897
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
morning cleanse are you doing the heavy

898
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,760
metal detox cleanse

899
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,679
so

900
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,200
are you doing it in supplementation are

901
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,640
you doing anything else so when someone

902
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,840
says i'm doing mm it might be a little

903
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,679
bit of celery juice and then you're

904
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
doing a couple of recipes or it could be

905
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,120
a little less or a little more and if

906
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
your poop still sinks

907
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,640
you might have a lot more healing to do

908
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,320
you might need to do more you know tools

909
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,559
i'm not saying everybody needs to do mm

910
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,880
and then have a poop that actually

911
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,039
floats midway or to the top i'm saying

912
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,080
it's going to happen to you if you clean

913
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,200
up long enough you'll see it mid-float

914
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,840
and it will be fiber it will be pulp it

915
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,880
will be pectin and any fat in any

916
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,679
protein in that stool is gone you will

917
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,360
have a stool that if it was analyzed by

918
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,279
a functional medicine doctor they

919
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,279
wouldn't find fat or protein in it and

920
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919
they would be confused

921
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,960
they'd be like this stool

922
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,399
is all cucumber and

923
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
lemon and banana

924
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,679
and potato and all these other things

925
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
where it's all

926
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
fiber

927
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,760
pulp pectin

928
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
right

929
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,440
it's all of that

930
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,039
and any protein and fat in your diet

931
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,559
gets absorbed quickly so then all of a

932
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,120
sudden your liver gets stronger and

933
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,279
stronger and stronger and your your your

934
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,200
stomach breaks down everything and it

935
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,039
gets stronger that's what happens when

936
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,720
people bring back their guts they're

937
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,559
doing the mono cleanse for a long time

938
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,799
and they bring back their guts it gets

939
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,240
so strong there's no protein and fat in

940
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,200
their stool anymore even if they eat

941
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,559
avocado that means if that person eats

942
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,399
an avocado the poop still won't sink if

943
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,000
the person has a little bit of nuts the

944
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,559
poop won't the poop won't sink and i'll

945
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,120
tell you why they got their their guts

946
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,600
so sharp and so strong in their

947
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,120
hydrochlor chloric acid hcl was so

948
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,279
strong breaking down those proteins in

949
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,440
their liver broke everything down in

950
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,480
their pancreas

951
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,559
right

952
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,519
sent out a lot of digestive enzymes and

953
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,720
all of that was so keen and so

954
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,440
strong

955
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,519
that their poops took mid flight in the

956
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,919
toilet they took mid-flight they

957
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,840
actually started surfacing a little bit

958
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,559
and they were clean and they were filled

959
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,399
with fiber and pulp and all the fat and

960
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,519
all that even an avocado if you ate an

961
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,600
avocado was absorbed and utilized and

962
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,720
broken down and it wasn't still in the

963
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,640
intestinal tract so here's what happens

964
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,240
people walk around with all this in

965
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,919
their intestinal tract that peanut

966
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,919
butter can stand there for years that

967
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,240
chicken can stay in there for years that

968
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,720
egg can stay in the intestinal tract on

969
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,640
the walls bits and pieces for years it

970
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,399
can stay in the liver all of this can

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,159
stay in the liver the peanut butter the

972
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,320
almond butter can stain the liver for

973
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,760
years and it builds up and it builds up

974
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,039
and it builds up and it rots and it

975
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
builds up

976
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,640
and when it does

977
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,720
right

978
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,559
your system breaks down a little bit you

979
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,320
don't have that strength of the hcl in

980
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,800
the bio and then what happens is every

981
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,280
poop just sinks every poop sinks every

982
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,079
poop sinks and they sink

983
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,760
but man you do like 369 advanced and

984
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,440
you're all raw long enough that you

985
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,839
clean up all that debris and you do the

986
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,440
mono cleanse and you're all clean long

987
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,119
enough and you're doing that and you

988
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
take all the overt fats out and you

989
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,440
build up your liver and you build up

990
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,280
your hcl man you're gonna be cleaning

991
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,200
things up so much that when you drop a

992
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,040
little avocado inside your stomach did

993
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,320
you hear this check this out did you

994
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,399
guys hear this

995
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,520
all the time it happens there's always

996
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,720
somebody in the medical meeting

997
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,839
community

998
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,079
that does the mono cleanse for a year

999
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,560
or two to heal everything they heal

1000
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,440
everything and then they say i'm sick of

1001
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,599
eating just these these foods i'm sick

1002
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,119
of this i'm going to go and have avocado

1003
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,560
and i'm going to go and have beans and

1004
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,839
i'm going to go and have rice and i'm

1005
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,680
going to go to have all these things i

1006
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,240
want to have chicken and i'm going to go

1007
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,560
and have all that and i feel great and

1008
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,079
my system's working great because all

1009
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,960
that they did by building themselves up

1010
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,359
and strengthening their their liver and

1011
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,040
their stomach

1012
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,880
and when you take it to that point you

1013
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,200
end up going to bathroom you'll just see

1014
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,520
fiber come up because all the protein

1015
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,440
and all the fat will be gone and what's

1016
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,359
happening is everybody on their nut

1017
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,280
butter is fine everybody on their eggs

1018
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,720
whatever they want to be on chicken nut

1019
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,800
butters eggs

1020
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,040
whatever it is that they're doing it

1021
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,760
doesn't get fully broken down it becomes

1022
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,440
a dead weight and it's in the stool

1023
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,520
whether your functional medicine doctor

1024
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,960
knows or anybody else it becomes heavy

1025
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,480
and it sits in the stool and it goes to

1026
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,880
the bottom toilet and that's fine you

1027
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
can still be healthy even though things

1028
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,040
are breaking down like your liver is

1029
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
weakening your hcl is weakening things

1030
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,240
are going wrong you can still be a

1031
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,079
fairly healthy person

1032
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,720
you can be on a medical medium diet

1033
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,800
healing yourself and your poops don't

1034
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,720
