[144.42 - 148.26] emotional event in your life I'm sure

[151.44 - 157.02] life right we've all had that happen
[153.72 - 159.38] where there's some type of emotional
[157.02 - 159.38] event
[159.96 - 166.08] there can also be a soul aspect to
[162.84 - 167.48] emotional events when something terrible
[166.08 - 171.48] happens
[167.48 - 173.76] your soul which normally resides inside
[171.48 - 177.24] your brain in this area
[173.76 - 179.10] that's where our soul normally resides
[177.24 - 180.48] in this area this is actually really
[179.10 - 182.70] incredible information we're talking
[180.48 - 184.92] about right now it like gives me
[182.70 - 187.22] goosebumps when I'm even reading about
[184.92 - 187.22] it
[188.46 - 194.58] your soul which normally resides in your
[192.66 - 198.54] brain
[194.58 - 200.52] gets projected boom
[198.54 - 202.50] out of your body
[200.52 - 205.98] to protect you
[202.50 - 208.50] from a certain amount of Soul injury
[205.98 - 211.68] everything's going great my soul's over
[208.50 - 214.04] here everything's going good my soul is
[211.68 - 217.20] where my brain is my soul is here
[214.04 - 221.60] everything's going great an emotional
[217.20 - 221.60] event hits boom your soul
[221.82 - 224.78] exits
[225.48 - 233.36] projects out of your body to protect you
[229.08 - 233.36] from a certain amount of Soul injury
[234.00 - 239.76] that's what happens it's protecting you
[236.16 - 243.84] from a certain amount of Soul injury so
[239.76 - 244.98] it projects out of your head out of your
[243.84 - 246.42] body
[244.98 - 248.40] and that's the whole thing where
[246.42 - 250.20] someone's like
[248.40 - 252.48] I was out of body that was an
[250.20 - 255.68] out-of-body experience I was looking
[252.48 - 255.68] down at myself
[257.04 - 262.74] when that car crash happened I saw
[259.92 - 266.12] myself it was as if I was out of body
[262.74 - 266.12] that wasn't even in me
[267.30 - 272.46] some people can feel this out-of-body
[269.46 - 275.10] experience watching themselves from afar
[272.46 - 277.26] or even above where they're seeing
[275.10 - 279.24] themselves even if they can't physically
[277.26 - 281.88] see themselves they see themselves
[279.24 - 284.76] there's a feeling they get their soul
[281.88 - 287.24] was projected out of their head out of
[284.76 - 287.24] their body
[287.70 - 293.54] Ivan says it's a soul not inside the
[289.56 - 293.54] heart the soul is not inside the heart
[293.88 - 298.92] and I talked about this the other day
[296.16 - 302.28] it's why in the medieval times they
[298.92 - 304.98] focused on beheading everybody
[302.28 - 307.26] right they beheaded everybody
[304.98 - 308.70] and there was a reason for that because
[307.26 - 311.82] there was
[308.70 - 315.54] in essence everybody knew
[311.82 - 318.24] that this was the most important area
[315.54 - 320.70] not because we spoke but because it's
[318.24 - 323.10] the most important area
[320.70 - 325.74] was here
[323.10 - 328.56] punishment
[325.74 - 331.02] was the guillotine punishment was always
[328.56 - 333.90] chopping everybody's heads off and then
[331.02 - 335.82] putting their heads on a pike right and
[333.90 - 337.98] having their heads on a pike so you walk
[335.82 - 339.48] through the village and everybody in the
[337.98 - 342.44] Villager heads are all chopped off and
[339.48 - 342.44] they're on the bikes right
[342.66 - 348.66] there's a reason why they use the
[344.58 - 350.34] guillotine for so many centuries
[348.66 - 354.00] in Europe
[350.34 - 357.54] old England they use the guillotine
[354.00 - 360.72] because chopping off the head was the
[357.54 - 363.42] most satisfying it was the status that
[360.72 - 366.30] that was the that was the satisfying
[363.42 - 368.64] aspect
[366.30 - 371.10] that made everybody happy that wanted to
[368.64 - 373.08] chop that person's head off they weren't
[371.10 - 374.94] happy until their head was chopped off
[373.08 - 376.86] they weren't happy if they were killed
[374.94 - 378.54] they weren't happy if they were stabbed
[376.86 - 381.48] in a kill or killed in a different way
[378.54 - 386.04] they weren't
[381.48 - 388.14] they weren't happy if they were drowned
[386.04 - 391.82] they were happy
[388.14 - 391.82] when their heads were chopped off
[394.32 - 398.34] some people so what I'm talking about is
[396.48 - 400.26] emotional events if you just got on here
[398.34 - 401.40] would I I'm saying something really
[400.26 - 403.86] really
[401.40 - 406.74] profound piece of information from above
[403.86 - 408.42] is that our soul is in this area
[406.74 - 410.52] and if you believe your soul is down in
[408.42 - 412.20] your feet if you believe your soul is
[410.52 - 413.70] where your feet is that's fine too and
[412.20 - 415.98] then it gets projected out of the body
[413.70 - 418.26] fine Erica Mallett says I remember when
[415.98 - 421.94] I first heard this information from aw I
[418.26 - 421.94] was shocked but it makes so much sense
[422.94 - 428.34] if you believe your soul is in your knee
[425.82 - 430.92] if you believe your soul is in your knee
[428.34 - 432.96] that's where your soul is
[430.92 - 434.40] if that makes you feel better if you're
[432.96 - 435.96] somebody that just doesn't believe the
[434.40 - 437.58] soul is in this area you don't believe
[435.96 - 440.66] the soul is here
[437.58 - 440.66] you don't believe that
[441.24 - 445.16] you think your soul is here in your knee
[446.58 - 452.64] the healing shop table on IG says that's
[448.68 - 456.84] why we say I was beside myself
[452.64 - 459.36] so true so true
[456.84 - 462.36] another comment on IG
[459.36 - 464.40] and my mommy says this makes no s this
[462.36 - 467.88] makes so much sense because when I was
[464.40 - 469.74] 15 or 16 and living in a toxic home my
[467.88 - 471.90] soul must have left because there is a
[469.74 - 474.42] period of time when I felt like I was
[471.90 - 477.68] watching my life from above yes because
[474.42 - 480.84] it protects your soul it's an innate
[477.68 - 484.20] internal guidance and wisdom of our body
[480.84 - 486.72] to project our soul out
[484.20 - 489.00] Justina
[486.72 - 491.54] it happened to me and I thought I was
[489.00 - 491.54] going crazy
[491.82 - 496.50] we go through a hard time something
[493.74 - 499.26] happens to us
[496.50 - 502.20] okay let's see every
[499.26 - 504.12] every melt heel says melto heel says I
[502.20 - 505.68] feel like mine never came back and
[504.12 - 507.00] that's something people can feel when
[505.68 - 509.46] they've been traumatized they feel like
[507.00 - 511.74] their soul has never come back that does
[509.46 - 514.02] happen where they feel that way
[511.74 - 515.52] we go through a hard time we go through
[514.02 - 517.80] an experience that's really scary
[515.52 - 519.72] something happens emotionally or we're
[517.80 - 522.24] emotionally abused or we have a
[519.72 - 524.94] relationship breakup where it's so
[522.24 - 526.98] traumatizing that relationship break up
[524.94 - 530.16] that you feel like you're watching
[526.98 - 532.92] yourself from above or you're beside
[530.16 - 536.28] yourself like you just said earlier you
[532.92 - 539.76] feel like you're witnessing it
[536.28 - 542.40] and in an out-of-body experience you
[539.76 - 546.30] feel as if you're witnessing it from
[542.40 - 548.94] afar that's what it feels like
[546.30 - 551.28] that's because Spirit of compassion gave
[548.94 - 553.68] me this information to answer why anyone
[551.28 - 555.78] has ever felt that way and put it in the
[553.68 - 557.82] brain saver book Because when we go
[555.78 - 560.34] through an experience
[557.82 - 562.50] and we're walking along and our soul is
[560.34 - 564.78] here
[562.50 - 568.62] and then boom that experience happens
[564.78 - 571.56] and our souls projected out of us
[568.62 - 572.82] Boom Out Of Us
[571.56 - 575.16] and there's somebody that doesn't
[572.82 - 577.14] believe what Spirit of compassion said
[575.16 - 579.18] where our soul resides in our brain our
[577.14 - 580.92] soul resides in this area and you
[579.18 - 584.70] believe your soul resides in your feet
[580.92 - 586.20] I'm not judging you that's fine if you
[584.70 - 588.60] believe your soul is in your knee that's
[586.20 - 591.84] where your soul is it's in your name
[588.60 - 596.18] fine it's still projected boom out of
[591.84 - 596.18] you when you go through an experience
[600.26 - 604.56] some people can feel this out of Body
[602.46 - 606.84] Experience watching themselves from afar
[604.56 - 610.94] or even above
[606.84 - 610.94] this is a safety mechanism
[611.34 - 615.44] this is a safety mechanism
[615.66 - 619.80] this way your soul doesn't have to
[617.82 - 626.16] experience the full amount of pain from
[619.80 - 629.48] betrayal or loss betrayal hurts so bad
[626.16 - 629.48] God does it ever
[630.12 - 634.68] Nito says when I have gone through Nito
[633.18 - 636.60] and Rumble
[634.68 - 639.30] says when I have gone through emotional
[636.60 - 641.82] trauma I always felt like I was out of
[639.30 - 644.10] it like my mind was not working or gone
[641.82 - 646.58] or something thank you for explaining
[644.10 - 646.58] this feeling
[649.74 - 654.18] this way your soul doesn't have to
[651.60 - 657.78] experience the full amount of pain just
[654.18 - 660.12] partial pain our soul feels partial pain
[657.78 - 662.36] like part of it
[660.12 - 662.36] foreign
[665.42 - 671.40] hurts so bad
[669.42 - 674.04] it's hell
[671.40 - 676.50] betrayal is hell
[674.04 - 679.70] it's hell
[676.50 - 679.70] that's what betrayal is
[680.72 - 689.06] loss hurts so bad
[686.28 - 689.06] loss
[689.66 - 693.84] Indescribable unless you walked in that
[692.40 - 696.36] person's shoes do you know what that
[693.84 - 699.54] loss feels like if someone's lost may
[696.36 - 702.30] not seem big but it's big someone's
[699.54 - 703.86] betrayal may not seem big but it's big
[702.30 - 706.86] to them
[703.86 - 708.90] and when it's big enough to them where
[706.86 - 712.20] it hurts
[708.90 - 716.22] then boom the souls
[712.20 - 718.74] cast out for a moment to protect it so
[716.22 - 721.56] it's only partial hurt

[777.90 - 783.98] you may have heard of the supernatural
[780.18 - 783.98] occurrence of Mike the Headless Chicken
[786.48 - 792.44] it's an unbelievable
[789.66 - 792.44] true story
[793.38 - 798.06] Mike was a chicken
[795.48 - 801.48] in the 1940s
[798.06 - 803.66] who survived long after his head was cut
[801.48 - 803.66] off
[805.68 - 811.86] Mike the Headless Chicken was a chicken
[808.74 - 815.06] that had his head cut off
[811.86 - 815.06] and still was alive
[818.40 - 824.28] there are a lot of theories
[821.28 - 826.50] theories out there about how this
[824.28 - 828.96] happened how can Mike the Headless
[826.50 - 831.90] Chicken walk around
[828.96 - 834.98] eating out of his neck
[831.90 - 834.98] and stay alive
[839.22 - 844.62] after hearing this story at the time in
[842.04 - 846.24] the 1940s
[844.62 - 848.96] hundreds
[846.24 - 852.36] and hundreds of farmers
[848.96 - 857.30] worldwide started chopping their
[852.36 - 857.30] chickens heads off in experimental ways
[859.10 - 865.82] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[862.56 - 869.10] of chickens were beheaded in different
[865.82 - 871.64] grotesque ways to see if they would
[869.10 - 871.64] survive it
[875.64 - 881.34] it became an obsession
[878.76 - 885.24] chopping the heads off in various places
[881.34 - 889.44] because people were in such disbelief so
[885.24 - 892.32] farmers were chopping chickens heads off
[889.44 - 895.94] in different places on the chicken
[892.32 - 895.94] different places on the chicken
[896.28 - 901.44] because they were in complete disbelief
[899.06 - 904.62] complete disbelief
[901.44 - 907.58] so they were chopping chickens heads off
[904.62 - 907.58] is what they were doing
[911.16 - 915.02] because they're in disbelief
[925.44 - 930.24] Farmers would
[927.24 - 932.58] sever the heads higher up
[930.24 - 935.52] okay so you got your chicken
[932.58 - 937.08] they would sever the heads higher up
[935.52 - 938.76] because they're thinking how is this
[937.08 - 940.56] even possible
[938.76 - 943.02] so hundreds and hundreds of chickens
[940.56 - 944.82] were beheaded but higher up in all kinds
[943.02 - 946.50] of different places because they don't
[944.82 - 949.14] understand how a chicken can get his
[946.50 - 951.60] head completely cut off
[949.14 - 954.38] and still go around and eat through its
[951.60 - 954.38] neck and live
[956.88 - 961.14] it became an obsession chopping the
[959.16 - 963.90] heads off in various places because
[961.14 - 965.64] people were in such disbelief Farmers
[963.90 - 968.10] would severe the heads higher up
[965.64 - 971.34] preserving even more of the chicken's
[968.10 - 972.56] neck and brain stem than mics
[971.34 - 976.38] foreign
[972.56 - 979.26] ERS preserved more of the brain stem
[976.38 - 982.20] than Mike the Headless Chicken whose
[979.26 - 985.80] head was completely cut off so farmers
[982.20 - 988.26] were cutting off all kinds of places on
[985.80 - 992.34] chickens everywhere
[988.26 - 994.38] chopping their heads off chunk chunk
[992.34 - 996.48] and they were doing it higher up trying
[994.38 - 999.00] to preserve as much brain stem as
[996.48 - 1000.80] possible trying to even preserve half
[999.00 - 1002.98] the brain and they were chopping the
[1000.80 - 1005.66] chicken's head off
[1002.98 - 1008.48] Cornelius says I've heard you say that
[1005.66 - 1011.48] so often now but it always blows my mind
[1008.48 - 1014.12] because my work as a psychotherapist is
[1011.48 - 1016.72] so different now Cornelia monitor here
[1014.12 - 1016.72] truly
[1021.98 - 1026.84] Farmers would never Farmers would severe
[1024.86 - 1028.82] the heads higher up preserving even more
[1026.84 - 1031.94] of the chicken's neck and brainstem than
[1028.82 - 1034.40] mics than Mike's neck Mike the chicken
[1031.94 - 1036.82] that lived and was walking around and
[1034.40 - 1036.82] eating
[1038.18 - 1041.18] trying to see if their chickens would
[1040.10 - 1043.94] live too
[1041.18 - 1047.06] over a hundred thousand chickens were
[1043.94 - 1049.64] beheaded in this process over a hundred
[1047.06 - 1052.04] thousand chickens were beheaded during
[1049.64 - 1055.10] this process
[1052.04 - 1056.72] and they never survived not one chicken
[1055.10 - 1058.12] survived
[1056.72 - 1060.50] but Mike
[1058.12 - 1063.16] survived and Mike had his whole head
[1060.50 - 1063.16] chopped off
[1066.14 - 1070.76] here's what no one knows about how Mike
[1068.72 - 1073.46] stayed alive
[1070.76 - 1075.38] get ready for this
[1073.46 - 1078.86] because I asked Spirit of compassion
[1075.38 - 1080.60] questions it's one of my pastimes and I
[1078.86 - 1081.80] thought I would put one of my little
[1080.60 - 1084.56] pastimes because I asked Spirit
[1081.80 - 1086.42] compassion can I please ask you a
[1084.56 - 1089.42] question about Mike the Headless Chicken
[1086.42 - 1091.88] I would love to put Mike the Headless
[1089.42 - 1093.32] Chicken in here and sort of compassion
[1091.88 - 1095.42] it's like it's not what you want to put
[1093.32 - 1098.42] in here
[1095.42 - 1101.86] it's what's important which which is
[1098.42 - 1101.86] critically important for people
[1102.26 - 1106.40] because it's not all about Anthony
[1104.48 - 1109.36] William or these books would be all
[1106.40 - 1109.36] about Anthony William
[1111.02 - 1115.94] and spirit of compassion
[1113.84 - 1118.64] gave me a little gift
[1115.94 - 1121.46] and said I will put
[1118.64 - 1125.00] Mike the Headless Chicken
[1121.46 - 1126.92] inside the brain saver book
[1125.00 - 1128.66] over a hundred thousand chickens were
[1126.92 - 1130.82] beheaded in this process and they never
[1128.66 - 1133.46] survived here's what no one knows about
[1130.82 - 1136.16] how Mike stayed alive
[1133.46 - 1138.80] when I asked Spirit of compassion and
[1136.16 - 1140.66] why it's relevant here and that's also
[1138.80 - 1142.82] why Spirit of compassion let me put Mike
[1140.66 - 1146.00] the Headless Chicken in here because it
[1142.82 - 1149.74] was relevant
[1146.00 - 1149.74] a chicken has a soul
[1151.22 - 1154.54] that's not me saying it
[1154.82 - 1158.98] that's not me saying a chicken has a
[1156.80 - 1158.98] soul
[1160.46 - 1164.18] not like when a plant-based person says
[1162.32 - 1166.28] all animals have soul
[1164.18 - 1168.08] have a soul no that's not me saying it
[1166.28 - 1170.78] Spirit of compassion is saying a chicken
[1168.08 - 1173.78] has a soul this isn't an anti-chicken
[1170.78 - 1175.40] anti this is an anti-vegan this isn't
[1173.78 - 1176.96] whatever or this is vegan whatever
[1175.40 - 1179.30] that's not what all this is
[1176.96 - 1182.02] this isn't a talk having anything to do
[1179.30 - 1182.02] with any of that
[1185.12 - 1190.76] a chicken has a soul which normally
[1188.18 - 1192.98] resides in its brain Spirit of
[1190.76 - 1196.58] compassion told me that a chicken has a
[1192.98 - 1198.56] soul which resides in the chicken's
[1196.58 - 1200.90] brain
[1198.56 - 1205.66] just like ours
[1200.90 - 1205.66] just like our soul that resides here
[1207.20 - 1213.70] at the traumatic time of having Mike's
[1210.68 - 1213.70] head chopped off
[1214.52 - 1220.42] this chicken soul
[1216.86 - 1220.42] left the chicken's brain
[1223.40 - 1230.36] instead of floating away Into The Ether
[1227.66 - 1232.88] when someone dies
[1230.36 - 1237.14] or a pet dies
[1232.88 - 1240.40] and their soul leaves them and floats
[1237.14 - 1240.40] out of their head
[1241.04 - 1248.86] they passed away their soul is floating
[1243.74 - 1248.86] away their soul enters the ether
[1250.96 - 1258.56] instead of floating away in the ether as
[1255.62 - 1260.54] the chicken's body died the chicken's
[1258.56 - 1263.12] body died
[1260.54 - 1268.48] the head was chopped off of my the
[1263.12 - 1268.48] chicken and the body instead of dying
[1268.76 - 1273.62] stayed alive
[1271.28 - 1275.72] instead of floating away in the ether as
[1273.62 - 1278.30] the chicken bodies died chicken's body
[1275.72 - 1281.30] died the chicken's Soul entered into the
[1278.30 - 1286.06] chicken's body hear this Spirit of
[1281.30 - 1286.06] compassion answered a question for me
[1287.78 - 1294.52] and it blows my freaking mind it blows
[1292.04 - 1294.52] my mind
[1297.26 - 1301.82] the chicken soul entered into the
[1300.20 - 1305.98] chicken's body
[1301.82 - 1305.98] instead of floating away in The Ether
[1307.52 - 1313.16] get ready for this
[1309.62 - 1315.56] giving the physical body's will the will
[1313.16 - 1316.88] which is called strength
[1315.56 - 1318.80] strength
[1316.88 - 1321.50] giving the
[1318.80 - 1323.18] physical body of the chicken the
[1321.50 - 1325.94] chickens will
[1323.18 - 1328.40] extra strength to survive
[1325.94 - 1331.04] and all the other Farmers chopped off
[1328.40 - 1333.68] thousands upon thousands hundreds of
[1331.04 - 1337.40] thousands of chickens heads off
[1333.68 - 1340.16] but those chickens Souls did not go back
[1337.40 - 1342.98] and enter into the chicken's body those
[1340.16 - 1344.36] chicken Souls
[1342.98 - 1347.00] floated up
[1344.36 - 1348.98] to The Ether
[1347.00 - 1351.08] hundreds of thousands of chickens that
[1348.98 - 1352.28] were beheaded those Souls of those
[1351.08 - 1355.78] chickens
[1352.28 - 1355.78] floated to The Ether
[1356.18 - 1361.06] and did not re-enter into the chicken's
[1359.30 - 1365.26] body
[1361.06 - 1365.26] but Mike the Headless Chicken
[1365.66 - 1368.56] his soul
[1370.46 - 1376.10] entered into the body
[1372.38 - 1377.48] and granted the body extra strength to
[1376.10 - 1380.30] survive
[1377.48 - 1383.26] get ready for this one this will blow
[1380.30 - 1383.26] your mind
[1385.22 - 1388.06] not only
[1389.00 - 1393.68] did the soul of that chicken enter into
[1392.06 - 1395.42] the body giving the body physical
[1393.68 - 1398.06] strength
[1395.42 - 1401.56] by adding to the physical will power the
[1398.06 - 1401.56] will and the strength of that chicken
[1401.90 - 1407.78] but the soul had intelligence in it do
[1406.10 - 1408.92] you believe your soul has Intelligence
[1407.78 - 1411.32] in it
[1408.92 - 1414.26] when you leave here it has no
[1411.32 - 1417.74] intelligence in it when your soul leaves
[1414.26 - 1421.00] here it has Intelligence inside the soul
[1417.74 - 1421.00] as it leaves here
[1422.72 - 1428.24] Spirit of compassion told me
[1426.20 - 1430.04] instead of floating away into the ether
[1428.24 - 1431.78] as the chicken's body died the chicken
[1430.04 - 1434.42] soul entered into the chicken's body
[1431.78 - 1436.64] giving the physical body's will extra
[1434.42 - 1438.74] strength to survive along with
[1436.64 - 1441.68] intelligence this is the part that blows
[1438.74 - 1444.74] my mind along with intelligence the soul
[1441.68 - 1447.02] had gathered from the chicken's brain
[1444.74 - 1449.36] the soul of the chicken gathered
[1447.02 - 1452.42] intelligence from the chicken's brain
[1449.36 - 1454.64] and took it along with the soul and then
[1452.42 - 1456.80] the Soul re-entered into the chicken's
[1454.64 - 1459.74] physical body with the intelligence of
[1456.80 - 1463.34] what was in the brain meaning eat
[1459.74 - 1465.26] Peck around the yard live
[1463.34 - 1468.26] its legs

[1468.26 - 1472.30] with no brain no head
[1476.78 - 1481.66] that is
[1478.10 - 1481.66] Mike stayed alive
[1481.70 - 1488.12] because by entering his body his soul
[1485.30 - 1491.66] gave strength of Will and brain

[1795.56 - 1798.04] whatsoever
[1798.16 - 1802.88] relationships are a powerful example of

[1805.04 - 1810.08] tremendous amount of heat is generated
[1807.56 - 1811.94] in the emotional centers of the brain so
[1810.08 - 1814.16] this is really important to know a
[1811.94 - 1816.98] tremendous amount of heat is generated
[1814.16 - 1818.30] in the brain when we have relationship
[1816.98 - 1823.00] issues
[1818.30 - 1823.00] lots of intense heat is generated
[1823.10 - 1827.96] what if the couple meaning whoever's
[1826.22 - 1830.30] involved in a relationship of any kind
[1827.96 - 1832.54] gets back together
[1830.30 - 1836.12] now the family members are friends again
[1832.54 - 1839.24] now the loved ones are in love again
[1836.12 - 1842.12] now the you know
[1839.24 - 1843.50] newlyweds are back together again now
[1842.12 - 1845.90] the girlfriend boyfriend are back
[1843.50 - 1846.98] together again however it is now the
[1845.90 - 1848.90] girlfriend girlfriend's back together
[1846.98 - 1851.00] again boyfriend's back together again
[1848.90 - 1853.70] whatever is happening with whatever
[1851.00 - 1856.04] relationship we have
[1853.70 - 1858.32] with another loved one a friendship
[1856.04 - 1860.12] whether it's intimate or not intimate
[1858.32 - 1862.28] whether it's a partnership whether it's
[1860.12 - 1865.04] a Business Partnership whatever it is
[1862.28 - 1867.80] everybody's back together again
[1865.04 - 1871.04] the relationship is mended things get
[1867.80 - 1874.66] better and then
[1871.04 - 1874.66] a problem occurs again
[1875.60 - 1879.64] a breakup occurs again
[1880.34 - 1885.14] neurons in the same emotional centers of
[1882.56 - 1888.02] the brain the same place in your brain
[1885.14 - 1891.02] gets shocked over again
[1888.02 - 1891.02] foreign
[1893.32 - 1898.64] I was pregnant and cheated on
[1896.96 - 1901.76] so sorry to hear that I mean that's
[1898.64 - 1905.78] that's really really hard
[1901.76 - 1908.12] and I can't like I I I can I can only
[1905.78 - 1910.72] imagine
[1908.12 - 1914.36] what you've gone through only imagine
[1910.72 - 1916.76] and and I'm not in your shoes so I I
[1914.36 - 1919.64] can't you know I'll never be able to
[1916.76 - 1922.10] experience it because I I'm you know I
[1919.64 - 1924.62] can't get pregnant and you know I can't
[1922.10 - 1925.88] and I haven't been in that but I what I
[1924.62 - 1928.22] really think about it and I can only
[1925.88 - 1930.56] imagine the hell you went through
[1928.22 - 1932.36] centauri's healing said mind-blowing I
[1930.56 - 1934.28] don't understand how people could go on
[1932.36 - 1936.68] to say this info was not from above
[1934.28 - 1939.20] where else could it possibly come from
[1936.68 - 1941.90] or find this info
[1939.20 - 1944.42] thank you Santoro's healing
[1941.90 - 1946.84] my favorite is medical medium is not
[1944.42 - 1946.84] spiritual
[1946.88 - 1951.14] is hearing a voice that gives incredible
[1949.64 - 1952.52] information it's both spiritual
[1951.14 - 1953.84] information and physical body
[1952.52 - 1957.14] information
[1953.84 - 1960.40] does that count as being spiritual
[1957.14 - 1960.40] I guess I'm not spiritual
[1960.68 - 1966.14] um scrub says I used to see myself from
[1962.84 - 1968.90] above when I'm in a conversation with
[1966.14 - 1970.70] people and my husband was in the room he
[1968.90 - 1973.28] used to criticize me a lot and I was
[1970.70 - 1975.62] nervous since the mm shots I haven't had
[1973.28 - 1977.84] this happen it's incredible the mm shots
[1975.62 - 1979.70] are something that I've never seen
[1977.84 - 1981.38] before like
[1979.70 - 1984.02] a spirit of compassion told me with
[1981.38 - 1986.42] these brain shot therapies that there'd
[1984.02 - 1987.62] be changes like we've never seen and
[1986.42 - 1990.74] coupled with all the other medical
[1987.62 - 1993.38] medium tools like what would happen I
[1990.74 - 1995.18] couldn't wait for this information to
[1993.38 - 1997.90] get out there
[1995.18 - 1997.90] huh
[1998.90 - 2002.26] what if the couple gets back together
[2000.58 - 2004.00] the relationship has meant that things
[2002.26 - 2006.70] get better and then a breakup occurs
[2004.00 - 2009.10] again neurons in the same emotional
[2006.70 - 2011.02] centers of the brain that were just
[2009.10 - 2013.60] starting to mend that we're just
[2011.02 - 2015.34] starting to heal I'm healing from
[2013.60 - 2017.50] whatever happened in that relationship
[2015.34 - 2019.42] I'm starting to feel better about what
[2017.50 - 2021.82] happened that relationship I'm talking
[2019.42 - 2024.04] to my loved one we're back together
[2021.82 - 2027.46] again I'm talking to my friend we're
[2024.04 - 2030.82] back together again I'm in I'm doing
[2027.46 - 2034.06] good I'm healing the wounds we're
[2030.82 - 2036.34] driving around on Sunday afternoon and
[2034.06 - 2039.46] we're happy and we just went out for
[2036.34 - 2043.24] lunch and everything's good amending the
[2039.46 - 2046.54] feelings that happened I feel safe again
[2043.24 - 2049.42] I feel trusting again all that's getting
[2046.54 - 2053.04] back together and then
[2049.42 - 2053.04] the same breakup occurs
[2055.90 - 2059.26] neurons in the same area of the
[2057.76 - 2061.06] emotional center of the brain gets
[2059.26 - 2064.06] shocked again
[2061.06 - 2064.06] foreign
[2064.42 - 2069.52] it's like an electrical shock treatment
[2066.30 - 2070.96] to that central nervous system tissue so
[2069.52 - 2074.76] that tissue in the central nervous
[2070.96 - 2074.76] system is getting re-shocked over again
[2074.98 - 2079.96] if the relationship continues on this
[2077.98 - 2082.42] roller coaster
[2079.96 - 2086.56] a roller coaster right the roller
[2082.42 - 2087.88] coaster ride relationships happen
[2086.56 - 2090.60] with
[2087.88 - 2090.60] it's like
[2091.27 - 2094.96] [Music]
[2093.06 - 2096.70] Neuroscience doesn't know any of this
[2094.96 - 2098.74] information
[2096.70 - 2100.84] they don't
[2098.74 - 2102.22] this this is a prime example of how
[2100.84 - 2103.48] science keeps on stealing this
[2102.22 - 2105.58] information
[2103.48 - 2106.90] I've been saying for years and
[2105.58 - 2108.34] Neuroscience doesn't have any of these
[2106.90 - 2110.98] details about any of this I've been
[2108.34 - 2112.54] saying for years it's in possible to
[2110.98 - 2114.46] survive on a ketogenic diet because
[2112.54 - 2116.38] there's no way to keep sugar away from
[2114.46 - 2117.34] the brain and survive and have the brain
[2116.38 - 2118.84] survive
[2117.34 - 2120.64] and I talked about how people's
[2118.84 - 2122.32] ketogenic diets aren't real ketogenic
[2120.64 - 2123.88] diets because there's always is some
[2122.32 - 2125.74] form of sugar in their ketogenic diet
[2123.88 - 2128.02] keeping the brain alive enough
[2125.74 - 2129.64] and then now scientists are so-called
[2128.02 - 2131.62] stealing the information from all the
[2129.64 - 2133.78] medical meaning books and lectures and
[2131.62 - 2136.60] now they're saying it's impossible to be
[2133.78 - 2137.80] ketogenic science but there's no study
[2136.60 - 2140.02] there's no anything they even say
[2137.80 - 2142.66] there's no study but they just take mm
[2140.02 - 2145.24] info it's we see it every day by the way
[2142.66 - 2148.36] like the medical Beam Team sees it every
[2145.24 - 2150.64] single day it is unbelievable and you
[2148.36 - 2153.24] guys see it every single day it's just
[2150.64 - 2153.24] foreign
[2155.28 - 2160.12] ER sees it every day it's just it's
[2157.60 - 2162.66] insane it's like insanity
[2160.12 - 2162.66] okay
[2164.02 - 2169.36] sorry to go off the beaten path a little
[2166.42 - 2170.56] bit you guys I apologize
[2169.36 - 2173.74] all right
[2170.56 - 2175.24] so we're on that roller coaster ride
[2173.74 - 2177.46] okay I just want to say one other thing
[2175.24 - 2180.34] remember a scientist is just a human who
[2177.46 - 2182.08] can write down hypotheses
[2180.34 - 2183.40] to try to study
[2182.08 - 2184.72] but where do they get all their
[2183.40 - 2186.94] hypotheses
[2184.72 - 2189.46] is it where do they come up with it they
[2186.94 - 2191.50] come up with it themselves no they don't
[2189.46 - 2193.66] they steal
[2191.50 - 2196.74] a scientist is a thief
[2193.66 - 2196.74] stealing an idea
[2196.90 - 2200.62] and then working with that idea but
[2199.00 - 2202.12] stealing that idea that's how insane
[2200.62 - 2205.24] that is
[2202.12 - 2207.04] that's a fact of how it works in science
[2205.24 - 2209.98] so they can try to experiment and
[2207.04 - 2211.72] observe on the idea they stole
[2209.98 - 2213.76] it's well known in history that's what
[2211.72 - 2215.38] it is scientists are just thieves
[2213.76 - 2219.52] they still
[2215.38 - 2221.26] oh don't get me wrong lab technicians
[2219.52 - 2223.00] are working on an idea they don't know
[2221.26 - 2226.26] what's stolen
[2223.00 - 2226.26] by the head scientists
[2227.74 - 2232.84] when okay so if the relationship
[2230.08 - 2235.18] continues on a roller coaster of making
[2232.84 - 2237.70] up followed by turmoil again and
[2235.18 - 2240.28] breaking up making up breaking up making
[2237.70 - 2242.74] up breaking up it's highs and lows we're
[2240.28 - 2245.62] made up again it's all good we had
[2242.74 - 2247.84] makeup time and now boom lose it's
[2245.62 - 2250.24] breakup time a month later it's makeup
[2247.84 - 2251.80] time a month later it's breakup time we
[2250.24 - 2253.90] could be friendships could be intimate
[2251.80 - 2256.66] non-intimate whatever it is make up
[2253.90 - 2258.76] breakup makeup breakup
[2256.66 - 2261.16] have you guys ever been in that have you
[2258.76 - 2262.90] guys ever been in makeup breakup makeup
[2261.16 - 2265.86] breakup even if it's friendships

[2265.86 - 2269.50] relationships have you guys been in
[2267.94 - 2271.24] makeup breakup

[2284.26 - 2287.76] up so you guys have experienced that
[2287.86 - 2292.42] Masa says with my own parents you've
[2290.22 - 2296.08] experienced that right it's exhausting
[2292.42 - 2298.54] so parents loved ones relationships
[2296.08 - 2301.00] yeah we're still page 88 right have you
[2298.54 - 2302.32] yes it's so exhausting Lana says Giselle
[2301.00 - 2304.06] says yes
[2302.32 - 2305.62] so you know the makeup and breakup thing
[2304.06 - 2307.90] right Hannah says yes

[2307.90 - 2311.92] understand this then you you know you're
[2310.06 - 2313.60] experienced you know what we're talking
[2311.92 - 2316.06] about here did you ever feel like it was
[2313.60 - 2318.04] like doing something to your brain did
[2316.06 - 2320.32] you ever feel that the makeup breakup
[2318.04 - 2321.94] thing was it doing anything to your
[2320.32 - 2323.56] brain did you experience any kind of
[2321.94 - 2325.42] stress something was happening did it
[2323.56 - 2327.34] feel like it feel like something was
[2325.42 - 2329.20] going wrong with the brain because you
[2327.34 - 2332.44] were making up breaking up all of it
[2329.20 - 2334.66] corny amazes unfortunately yep so you
[2332.44 - 2335.86] are feeling something happen whether it
[2334.66 - 2338.80] was siblings whether it was family
[2335.86 - 2340.90] whether it was loved ones whether it was
[2338.80 - 2343.90] right
[2340.90 - 2348.00] married couples whatever so yeah so it's
[2343.90 - 2348.00] horrible so yeah you're feeling it
[2348.70 - 2352.30] you get what Olga says I felt extremely
[2351.04 - 2355.96] exhausted
[2352.30 - 2357.88] it's exhausting to the brain
[2355.96 - 2359.98] if the relationship continues on this
[2357.88 - 2362.20] roller coaster of making up followed by
[2359.98 - 2364.78] turmoil again emotional wounds will keep
[2362.20 - 2366.64] hitting in the same emotional centers so
[2364.78 - 2369.52] what's happening is
[2366.64 - 2371.62] it's injuries to the same emotional
[2369.52 - 2376.20] center of the brain over and over again
[2371.62 - 2376.20] make a break of high low high low
[2378.10 - 2382.60] Hannah says that ex you experience it
[2380.20 - 2384.64] with your dad
[2382.60 - 2387.06] Tina says my brain felt crazy when it
[2384.64 - 2387.06] was happening
[2388.66 - 2392.68] Lana says I feel like my brain is being
[2390.64 - 2395.50] fried fried
[2392.68 - 2397.30] absolutely electricity is going to the
[2395.50 - 2399.76] same area of the emotional center of the
[2397.30 - 2401.08] brain and hitting it
[2399.76 - 2403.84] and that's what's happening like
[2401.08 - 2406.24] electrical shock treatment
[2403.84 - 2408.10] they can't find this information anymore
[2406.24 - 2411.58] I must be a genius
[2408.10 - 2415.24] since I can't be talking to any voice I
[2411.58 - 2418.24] can't be hearing a voice since age four
[2415.24 - 2420.22] been a genius then
[2418.24 - 2421.84] the details in this in these books are
[2420.22 - 2425.74] just incredible
[2421.84 - 2426.94] I must be a unbelievable phenomenon of a
[2425.74 - 2429.10] genius
[2426.94 - 2431.94] because certainly I can't be talking to
[2429.10 - 2431.94] a voice up above
[2435.22 - 2438.82] because I saw someone say something I
[2436.96 - 2440.50] saw a comment go up
[2438.82 - 2443.40] that's why I'm just talking about that
[2440.50 - 2443.40] right now that's all
[2448.66 - 2453.76] during the most traumatic moments on the
[2451.60 - 2455.88] roller coaster the soul is outside of
[2453.76 - 2459.16] the body watching and waiting as things
[2455.88 - 2461.32] subside so come back here is the most
[2459.16 - 2463.24] profound piece of this information right
[2461.32 - 2465.64] here prepare yourselves for this I just
[2463.24 - 2469.92] said it but I'll I'll just
[2465.64 - 2471.70] I'll just add a little to it okay
[2469.92 - 2475.36] most
[2471.70 - 2477.88] profound piece of information right here
[2475.36 - 2480.46] about this
[2477.88 - 2483.40] during the moment of this roller coaster
[2480.46 - 2485.92] ride you guys during the most traumatic
[2483.40 - 2488.32] moments of this roller coaster ride the
[2485.92 - 2490.36] up and down the makeups the breakups all
[2488.32 - 2492.28] of that with relationships during the
[2490.36 - 2496.50] most traumatic moments on this roller
[2492.28 - 2500.44] coaster the soul is outside of the body
[2496.50 - 2504.66] watching watching and waiting for things
[2500.44 - 2504.66] to subside so it can come back
[2505.30 - 2511.66] the soul is outside of the body
[2510.22 - 2515.56] the soul
[2511.66 - 2517.84] is outside of the body watching as the
[2515.56 - 2520.42] events are unfolding in that traumatic
[2517.84 - 2523.24] event and it's waiting to come back
[2520.42 - 2526.62] because the soul has
[2523.24 - 2526.62] a safe fault
[2527.50 - 2532.20] so that the soul doesn't get completely
[2529.54 - 2532.20] damaged
[2532.60 - 2537.66] by other experiences on this planet
[2537.88 - 2543.64] so as things get really chaotic and
[2540.70 - 2546.10] really problematic the soul
[2543.64 - 2547.66] projects out of the brain out of the
[2546.10 - 2549.52] body
[2547.66 - 2554.62] and awaits
[2549.52 - 2557.86] for things to cool down and calm down
[2554.62 - 2562.98] in that relationship before it comes
[2557.86 - 2562.98] back in and enters inside the brain
[2574.00 - 2577.72] when a pattern like this develops
[2575.98 - 2579.52] neurotransmitter hormones in the
[2577.72 - 2581.92] emotional centers of the brain start to
[2579.52 - 2584.22] gather information that another shock
[2581.92 - 2585.76] could be coming
[2584.22 - 2587.88] adaptive
[2585.76 - 2592.20] adaptive
[2587.88 - 2592.20] neurotransmitter midter chemicals
[2594.18 - 2601.20] neurotransmitter chemicals are actually
[2596.88 - 2601.20] recording taking in information
[2602.46 - 2606.04] neurotransmitter hormones in the
[2604.30 - 2608.02] emotional centers of the brain start to
[2606.04 - 2610.90] gather information at another shock
[2608.02 - 2612.82] could be coming on its way break up
[2610.90 - 2614.68] makeup breakup makeup and now
[2612.82 - 2616.36] neurotransmitter chemicals are like holy
[2614.68 - 2620.70] crap this is getting out of control
[2616.36 - 2620.70] there might be another shock on its way
[2626.92 - 2632.68] this can make a person hypersensitive
[2629.20 - 2635.14] and then you become sensitive sensitive
[2632.68 - 2637.00] like oh my God I can't handle this
[2635.14 - 2639.64] anymore I can't take another up and down
[2637.00 - 2641.68] I can't take another breakup makeup I
[2639.64 - 2643.24] can't take another lie I can't take
[2641.68 - 2646.30] another cheat I can't take another
[2643.24 - 2648.16] betrayal I can't take another Insanity I
[2646.30 - 2650.44] can't take anything I can't take it
[2648.16 - 2652.54] anymore I become hypersensitive those
[2650.44 - 2653.98] are neurotransmitter chemicals hormones
[2652.54 - 2657.66] inside the brain neurotransmitter
[2653.98 - 2660.52] hormones that are actually deciphering
[2657.66 - 2662.50] collecting information inside your brain
[2660.52 - 2664.48] and now you're becoming sensitive as a
[2662.50 - 2667.54] person
[2664.48 - 2669.88] Romina says Anthony
[2667.54 - 2672.18] oh the comment's gone when it goes up it
[2669.88 - 2672.18] goes up
[2676.06 - 2680.50] this can make a person hypersensitive
[2681.52 - 2684.18] allergic
[2684.64 - 2690.46] to the coming of the next breakup fight
[2687.82 - 2692.92] or cheat causing additional emotional
[2690.46 - 2694.96] responses and additional emotional pain
[2692.92 - 2696.76] now you're sensitive you're sensitive
[2694.96 - 2699.90] for the next sheet for the next breakup
[2696.76 - 2699.90] for the next fight
[2701.80 - 2704.04] foreign
[2704.56 - 2709.98] causing additional responses and
[2706.60 - 2709.98] additional emotional pain
[2711.16 - 2715.96] that allergic response varies in
[2713.68 - 2719.08] severity depending on how much the brain
[2715.96 - 2720.94] is lacking in its nutritional needs and
[2719.08 - 2723.52] what the soul and physical brain both
[2720.94 - 2726.22] remember from past trust issues and
[2723.52 - 2728.26] other breakups the allergic response you
[2726.22 - 2733.54] get I'm allergic
[2728.26 - 2736.06] I am allergic to another breakup makeup
[2733.54 - 2738.52] another confrontation
[2736.06 - 2743.38] another problem
[2738.52 - 2745.48] with this person or people I am allergic
[2743.38 - 2747.16] that allergic response varies in
[2745.48 - 2748.72] severity depending on how much the brain
[2747.16 - 2750.58] is lacking so now if our brain is
[2748.72 - 2752.86] missing things if our brain doesn't have
[2750.58 - 2755.86] enough B12 if our brain doesn't have
[2752.86 - 2758.56] enough zinc if our brain doesn't have
[2755.86 - 2760.84] enough things it needs enough you know
[2758.56 - 2764.52] vitamin C if our brain doesn't have
[2760.84 - 2764.52] enough of what it needs
[2764.98 - 2768.24] we can be in trouble
[2772.00 - 2777.04] these old wounds are a big part of how
[2774.58 - 2778.84] allergic you get in the present
[2777.04 - 2780.46] because again when we talk about
[2778.84 - 2782.14] emotional wounds we're talking about
[2780.46 - 2784.06] physical wounds to the brain tissue
[2782.14 - 2786.28] These Old Wounds can physically tear
[2784.06 - 2788.56] open again and again and again with a
[2786.28 - 2792.04] fresh emotional injury so as you start
[2788.56 - 2794.44] to mend physically in the brain and your
[2792.04 - 2796.24] soul projects out when you're in trauma
[2794.44 - 2798.10] and your soul comes back to your brain
[2796.24 - 2801.18] when you're not in trauma and you're so
[2798.10 - 2801.18] your brain is mending
[2801.64 - 2804.82] then we get sensitive when something
[2803.32 - 2807.46] happens again it's like I can't do
[2804.82 - 2811.50] another relationship I can't take a risk
[2807.46 - 2811.50] I can't do another thing
[2813.40 - 2816.42] I'm scared
[2816.88 - 2821.56] this isn't someone being over emotional
[2819.22 - 2823.78] this is a person experiencing a physical
[2821.56 - 2825.94] brain response to repeated emotional and
[2823.78 - 2827.50] physical brain injuries
[2825.94 - 2829.72] Tara Appleman says the detail and
[2827.50 - 2832.60] Clarity of this info never fails to blow
[2829.72 - 2835.90] me away I'm honored
[2832.60 - 2838.00] thank you for being here
[2835.90 - 2839.74] injured neurons in the emotional centers
[2838.00 - 2841.78] of the brain are receiving messages from
[2839.74 - 2844.48] neurotransmitter hormone chemicals as
[2841.78 - 2847.48] they try to send forewarning in hopes of
[2844.48 - 2850.30] stopping the situation our own brain is
[2847.48 - 2852.58] trying to stop the situation when we're
[2850.30 - 2854.20] being yelled at when we're having a hard
[2852.58 - 2857.28] time when we're going through some kind
[2854.20 - 2857.28] of emotional turmoil
[2857.50 - 2861.90] Collide spring says this is why I live
[2859.30 - 2861.90] with cats
[2864.64 - 2868.90] that's when a person learns their
[2866.38 - 2871.24] tolerance levels like their tolerance
[2868.90 - 2872.32] levels right that's when a person learns
[2871.24 - 2873.70] that
[2872.32 - 2876.82] foreign
[2873.70 - 2878.68] my throat's dry right now
[2876.82 - 2880.86] some talking so much if you guys don't
[2878.68 - 2880.86] mind
[2885.94 - 2888.88] that's when a person learns your
[2887.32 - 2891.28] tolerance level an allergic reaction
[2888.88 - 2893.14] escalates and Peaks to a point where you
[2891.28 - 2896.20] feel if you don't change your course in
[2893.14 - 2897.88] that moment some serious damage is going
[2896.20 - 2899.98] to occur some serious shit's going to go
[2897.88 - 2903.16] down
[2899.98 - 2905.32] where something's going to go terribly
[2903.16 - 2907.84] wrong if the course doesn't change
[2905.32 - 2910.48] something a switch gets if there's a
[2907.84 - 2912.64] switch in there a wire
[2910.48 - 2914.98] you're at your limit
[2912.64 - 2916.78] you become so allergic that you feel if
[2914.98 - 2920.68] you stay in the game you're going to get
[2916.78 - 2924.48] hurt past the point of no return
[2920.68 - 2924.48] that's information just blows my mind
[2924.64 - 2929.44] when this happens
[2926.92 - 2931.74] someone may leave the relationship for
[2929.44 - 2931.74] good
[2932.92 - 2938.32] if they even have the option
[2936.04 - 2939.72] before too much damage has been done in
[2938.32 - 2943.24] the emotional centers of the brain

[3152.70 - 3157.26] Etc don't know is it's a physical injury
[3155.16 - 3159.12] happening in the brain and you need the
[3157.26 - 3162.60] right tools
[3159.12 - 3164.34] and how to apply them and how to protect
[3162.60 - 3166.02] ourselves and heal our brains and that's
[3164.34 - 3167.88] something where science research doesn't
[3166.02 - 3169.62] know this and therapists don't know this
[3167.88 - 3171.54] that actual physical injuries are
[3169.62 - 3173.28] happening in the brain too and I talk

[3191.70 - 3198.96] Stacy Hyland says mm has healed me a lot
[3195.84 - 3201.24] but physical healing is nothing compared
[3198.96 - 3204.14] to the emotional healing that I've had

[3545.78 - 3550.56] amazing get my lemon down here when
[3548.64 - 3552.30] you're dealing with soft fruits there's
[3550.56 - 3554.96] high compression in this juicer but it's
[3552.30 - 3554.96] so worth it
[3555.84 - 3560.10] you just gotta sometimes take your time
[3557.34 - 3562.20] but I'm always you gotta you need to
[3560.10 - 3563.46] give it some time
[3562.20 - 3565.92] um but I'm always in a rush because I'm
[3563.46 - 3569.28] trying to get this done for us half cup
[3565.92 - 3572.64] tightly past fresh packed fresh parsley
[3569.28 - 3574.62] half cup of parsley so what I do is I
[3572.64 - 3575.88] pack it into my hand that's how I gauge
[3574.62 - 3576.96] it because that's how I've done it I've
[3575.88 - 3579.68] done that so many times where I've
[3576.96 - 3579.68] measured it out
[3580.62 - 3584.42] let me get some parsley down in here
[3595.20 - 3600.74] so I'm putting a half cup tightly packed
[3597.66 - 3600.74] parsley in here
[3608.28 - 3610.94] we go
[3612.60 - 3617.22] foreign
[3614.22 - 3617.22] good
[3617.70 - 3621.66] what else half cup roughly chopped
[3620.52 - 3624.98] lettuce
[3621.66 - 3624.98] get some lettuce in here
[3626.52 - 3629.66] excited about this
[3646.20 - 3651.30] and another one you guys what I love
[3648.60 - 3653.52] about this one is that actually because
[3651.30 - 3655.80] the brain shot therapies don't always
[3653.52 - 3658.56] taste good right because they weren't
[3655.80 - 3661.50] designed to actually taste good but when
[3658.56 - 3663.84] one tastes good it's like a few do you
[3661.50 - 3666.06] know when one has a good flavor it's
[3663.84 - 3667.80] just it's just really you know great all
[3666.06 - 3670.68] right and then we got half stock of
[3667.80 - 3673.76] celery going in here it's a small stick
[3670.68 - 3673.76] let's run that one in
[3675.54 - 3680.28] there we go
[3678.00 - 3682.50] now what you'll notice with the MN 1500
[3680.28 - 3684.72] or 900
[3682.50 - 3687.60] this is coming out dry
[3684.72 - 3690.00] the pulp is
[3687.60 - 3691.26] much drier it's not wet sloppy pulp and
[3690.00 - 3693.72] that's where you save money and food
[3691.26 - 3695.70] costs are rising
[3693.72 - 3699.30] and what I love about the 1500 and the
[3695.70 - 3700.74] 900 it saves money and food costs so you
[3699.30 - 3703.56] can do your medicine have your medicine
[3700.74 - 3704.28] maker going and you actually are saving
[3703.56 - 3706.64] money
[3704.28 - 3709.50] with food cost which is really important
[3706.64 - 3711.18] juicers just spit out everything juicing
[3709.50 - 3713.52] all goes in on the pulp and it's like
[3711.18 - 3716.58] you can run with other juicers so much
[3713.52 - 3718.92] produce through you'd have to be like
[3716.58 - 3720.48] it's unbelievable how much so what you
[3718.92 - 3722.72] do is you want to rub this through your
[3720.48 - 3722.72] screen
[3722.76 - 3726.90] because this is a very very sticky kind
[3725.82 - 3728.10] of juice
[3726.90 - 3730.32] okay
[3728.10 - 3731.88] so what you see
[3730.32 - 3733.92] that's the kind of Pulp we're talking
[3731.88 - 3735.78] about it's dry
[3733.92 - 3738.30] right
[3735.78 - 3741.18] incredible and it's tomatoes and
[3738.30 - 3743.16] strawberries and there's no way juicers
[3741.18 - 3745.32] can juice strawberries and make them
[3743.16 - 3747.90] come out that dry it's not possible
[3745.32 - 3751.34] which is just it's an incredible machine
[3747.90 - 3751.34] all right so what I'm doing is
[3752.64 - 3758.06] I'm just rubbing the screen so it goes
[3755.40 - 3758.06] on down through
[3759.84 - 3763.86] if you have fresh strawberries you could
[3761.76 - 3767.10] use that in this one too I had frozen
[3763.86 - 3769.20] strawberries is all I had there we go
[3767.10 - 3771.82] right
[3769.20 - 3782.95] I got my shot ready
[3771.82 - 3782.95] [Music]
[3784.56 - 3787.10] right
[3787.80 - 3795.24] I'm excited
[3788.88 - 3798.87] [Music]
[3795.24 - 3805.14] I have a fancy shot glass for this one
[3798.87 - 3808.10] [Music]

[4152.72 - 4154.84] um
[4154.94 - 4159.74] Dr Nesbitt says he loves Beatrice
[4157.64 - 4161.48] well that's that be sure she's here
[4159.74 - 4165.08] doctor
[4161.48 - 4166.52] says that's not entirely true either
[4165.08 - 4169.28] because
[4166.52 - 4171.44] Dr Nesbitt did not take Beatrice to a
[4169.28 - 4173.84] function a dinner
[4171.44 - 4176.08] where all the medical doctors went and
[4173.84 - 4179.06] they were eating steak
[4176.08 - 4182.00] Beatrice like steak
[4179.06 - 4184.58] um she likes it medium well done and she
[4182.00 - 4187.82] did not get invited to the gala to the
[4184.58 - 4190.28] medical Gala Dr Nesbitt says that
[4187.82 - 4192.68] he does like his steak and he likes to
[4190.28 - 4194.78] eat that in peace without Beatrice so he
[4192.68 - 4197.06] didn't want to invite her you guys are
[4194.78 - 4198.98] you guys I don't know how to fix this I
[4197.06 - 4200.06] have no idea what to do
[4198.98 - 4202.58] um
[4200.06 - 4206.14] Okay so
[4202.58 - 4206.14] the Beatrice
[4206.36 - 4209.26] oh beard
[4209.48 - 4217.54] okay listen you guys Beatrice you said
[4213.98 - 4217.54] that her mother-in-law
[4217.64 - 4223.76] um happens to be fond of Dr Nesbitt
[4221.60 - 4224.96] but thinks Beatrice could have done a
[4223.76 - 4228.80] lot better
[4224.96 - 4231.52] Beatrice met Dr Nesbitt
[4228.80 - 4231.52] in college
[4233.18 - 4236.96] um
[4234.32 - 4239.72] but there was another chicken doctor she
[4236.96 - 4243.08] wanted to be with and wanted to marry
[4239.72 - 4245.60] and um and so her argument with her
[4243.08 - 4249.08] mother is that Dr Nesbitt is not a good
[4245.60 - 4251.36] doctor what are you agreeing
[4249.08 - 4253.46] Dr Nesbitt said she knows of that
[4251.36 - 4255.92] chicken doctor and he was a
[4253.46 - 4258.98] he was a dysfunctional guy
[4255.92 - 4260.96] and wasn't going to make a good surgeon
[4258.98 - 4263.14] Dr espet said that Beatrice should be
[4260.96 - 4266.06] lucky to have
[4263.14 - 4268.40] Dr Nesbitt
[4266.06 - 4271.52] okay I you guys I can't do this all day
