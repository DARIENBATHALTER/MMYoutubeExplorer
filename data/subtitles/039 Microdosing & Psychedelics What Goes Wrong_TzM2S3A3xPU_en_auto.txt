[41.68 - 47.96] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.60 - 52.40] Williams there's a term out there that's
[47.96 - 57.72] intriguing to the mind it's interesting

[84.88 - 90.68] recreational drugs maybe you partied a
[87.48 - 94.12] lot maybe partying helped to take you

[98.92 - 104.04] is in your mind it's just there you know
[101.56 - 109.40] the word dosed or
[104.04 - 112.40] dosing or hey I'm totally dosed up it
[109.40 - 115.72] holds power so when you hear the word
[112.40 - 117.04] dose there's power involved and then say
[115.72 - 120.84] you're somebody that never did any
[117.04 - 124.36] recreational drugs you just lived a
[120.84 - 127.68] straight line and recreational drugs
[124.36 - 130.64] wasn't in your past or present it's not
[127.68 - 131.48] in your life but but there's a word in
[130.64 - 134.08] your
[131.48 - 137.48] subconsciousness in your Consciousness
[134.08 - 140.84] it's dosing or dose where' it come from
[137.48 - 144.00] conventional medicine the doctor you
[140.84 - 148.00] just remember it here's one dose take

[148.00 - 153.52] you hear it it holds power
[150.32 - 156.00] dosing and dose holds power on the
[153.52 - 160.00] subconscious and Consciousness it holds
[156.00 - 164.36] power on the mind then there's something
[160.00 - 166.32] called fear fear about
[164.36 - 169.44] oding
[166.32 - 172.36] overdosing that's another powerful word
[169.44 - 174.52] term that's etched in our mind
[172.36 - 176.40] Consciousness and subconsciousness so if
[174.52 - 179.80] you're somebody that played around with
[176.40 - 181.92] recreational drugs or still do you know
[179.80 - 185.80] know not to
[181.92 - 188.04] OD you know it in your soul and your
[185.80 - 191.68] being that it's not a good thing you're
[188.04 - 194.40] cautious to how much including just weed
[191.68 - 196.40] how much weed you smoke in a day and
[194.40 - 200.24] then you hear it out there you read
[196.40 - 203.28] stories you hear it on the news somebody
[200.24 - 207.84] overdosed this person overdosed last
[203.28 - 210.60] night they died this person ODed it's
[207.84 - 212.96] scary it could mean death
[210.60 - 217.24] and that resides in the Consciousness as
[212.96 - 221.92] well the term OD overdosing
[217.24 - 224.28] overdosed connects to dying death but
[221.92 - 227.92] when people don't feel good in general
[224.28 - 231.24] they're struggling mentally emotionally
[227.92 - 233.76] they got health issues they want a
[231.24 - 237.48] remedy they want
[233.76 - 240.04] medicine some type of medicine and you
[237.48 - 242.84] ask anybody who does Recreation ational
[240.04 - 245.32] drugs at one time in their life or they
[242.84 - 247.88] still do it now and you ask them why are
[245.32 - 250.72] they doing it so how come you're doing
[247.88 - 254.40] it and you'll get an answer I don't feel
[250.72 - 256.96] good I feel sick I got anxiety I have
[254.40 - 258.88] depression I have
[256.96 - 262.64] depersonalization I have all kinds of
[258.88 - 267.76] mental issues I have severe emotional
[262.64 - 270.20] trauma I have Old Wounds hurt pain and
[267.76 - 271.80] even people who didn't start that way
[270.20 - 274.16] they didn't have any of that at least
[271.80 - 277.20] they didn't think they did they got into
[274.16 - 279.68] recreational drugs and they were taking
[277.20 - 282.12] something and over time they took more
[279.68 - 285.04] of it more of it than it was interfering
[282.12 - 287.68] with their life making life more
[285.04 - 290.08] difficult and then got to a point where
[287.68 - 291.72] they needed help and then someone would
[290.08 - 292.60] say why are you doing it and they'd be
[291.72 - 297.24] like
[292.60 - 300.88] well I just life's been really hard I
[297.24 - 303.00] have a lot of problems and I just went
[300.88 - 305.28] and grabbed it and started using it it
[303.00 - 308.12] made me feel better but at the start
[305.28 - 310.80] they were just partying and the reason
[308.12 - 313.88] they took more and more of it and kept
[310.80 - 316.16] doing it wasn't just the addiction part
[313.88 - 319.56] it was because they were self-medicating
[316.16 - 322.44] they were looking for medicine they were
[319.56 - 324.96] self-medicating and then there's people
[322.44 - 327.48] that say they have self- control they
[324.96 - 331.64] can control their addiction they can
[327.48 - 333.68] control their partying they can control
[331.64 - 337.04] how many pills they take that the doctor
[333.68 - 338.92] gave them and then there's people that
[337.04 - 341.96] don't have
[338.92 - 345.12] self-control it's endless
[341.96 - 349.88] consumption Nothing Stops them but
[345.12 - 351.72] either way everybody knows there's power
[349.88 - 353.60] in the word
[351.72 - 355.72] dosing
[353.60 - 359.92] dosages
[355.72 - 363.24] ODed dose so no matter where ever
[359.92 - 365.08] someone is at in their life whether they
[363.24 - 367.12] took something in the past whether
[365.08 - 370.28] they're on a medication now in the
[367.12 - 373.72] present whether they feel pretty good
[370.28 - 377.16] whether they don't there's a word that
[373.72 - 380.32] catches their eye and it's micro doing
[377.16 - 383.72] right when someone says it I'm micro
[380.32 - 387.32] doing right then anyone who hears that
[383.72 - 390.64] is like ah what and all kinds of things
[387.32 - 392.80] run through their mind one is how come
[390.64 - 394.36] the doctor never told me that how come
[392.80 - 396.92] the doctor handing me a medication
[394.36 - 398.80] didn't say we're going to make you micro
[396.92 - 402.80] do or we're going to offer an option to
[398.80 - 404.64] micro do or how come the guy I partied
[402.80 - 407.68] with the other day didn't tell me about
[404.64 - 410.44] micro doing how come I didn't hear that
[407.68 - 411.92] when I was partying 20 years ago how
[410.44 - 413.48] come I never heard that before when I
[411.92 - 415.60] was hanging out with a bunch of people
[413.48 - 417.76] and they're all doing drugs many years
[415.60 - 420.32] ago in college and how come no one was
[417.76 - 423.64] saying how about micro do hey you should
[420.32 - 426.40] micro do at cocaine hey you should micro
[423.64 - 429.56] do at Molly you should micro do at
[426.40 - 432.12] ecstasy it's mind-blowing micro doing
[429.56 - 434.16] the term instantly you also think wait a
[432.12 - 437.44] minute is this scientific is science
[434.16 - 440.68] involved did some scientific body figure
[437.44 - 443.64] out that if you reduce the dose or make
[440.68 - 446.72] it appropriate in some way leveled or
[443.64 - 449.84] measured that we can take what we want
[446.72 - 451.32] and get something out of it and since
[449.84 - 453.24] your doctor's not going to still say
[451.32 - 454.64] anything about micro doing the
[453.24 - 456.44] alternative doctor is not going to say
[454.64 - 457.52] anything about micro doing your
[456.44 - 459.28] chiropractor is not going to say
[457.52 - 461.84] anything about micro doing you're not
[459.28 - 465.00] going to really hear about it anywhere
[461.84 - 468.20] besides kind of on the scene that's
[465.00 - 471.24] where you hear it on the scene and then
[468.20 - 474.52] you like it because it gives you a sense
[471.24 - 478.32] of control because you can't trust
[474.52 - 479.92] yourself you know that in the past heck
[478.32 - 482.12] people can't trust themselves with a bar
[479.92 - 483.00] of chocolate they'll gobble the whole
[482.12 - 485.76] thing
[483.00 - 486.96] down and then you think this must be
[485.76 - 490.44] some kind of
[486.96 - 492.80] controlled design it's micro doing
[490.44 - 495.76] someone else can handle it they can hand
[492.80 - 498.12] me that little tiny dosage and say we're
[495.76 - 500.52] micro doing and then I can take that
[498.12 - 503.28] tiny dosage and take it with confidence
[500.52 - 506.08] feeling like there's control over it and
[503.28 - 508.88] I'm not going overboard I'm not pushing
[506.08 - 513.32] it too hard or too far there's something
[508.88 - 516.16] about that it feels safe there seems to
[513.32 - 519.92] be some type of safety mechanism built
[516.16 - 522.76] into this everything is okay if you
[519.92 - 524.96] micro do it that's the message that
[522.76 - 528.04] comes through and then you hear a bad
[524.96 - 530.76] stories of the past or you remember
[528.04 - 533.80] certain stories that somebody told you
[530.76 - 537.44] of the past or you experienced something
[533.80 - 539.28] in the past such as a bad trip you
[537.44 - 541.36] remember a guy having a bad trip you you
[539.28 - 544.04] remember this girl having a bad trip you
[541.36 - 546.16] remember somebody having a bad trip they
[544.04 - 549.04] went too far they were injured by
[546.16 - 549.92] something whether it was a large dosage
[549.04 - 553.08] of
[549.92 - 555.84] iasa whether it was a large dosage siloc
[553.08 - 558.28] cybin whether it was a large dosage that
[555.84 - 561.24] night of ecstasy whatever it is you
[558.28 - 564.52] heard they had a bad run it really hurt
[561.24 - 570.08] them they were injured by it and then
[564.52 - 573.28] you think aha that aha moment micro do
[570.08 - 575.64] we figured it out the world figured it
[573.28 - 577.72] out everybody did science must have
[575.64 - 580.96] figured it out all the shamans must have
[577.72 - 584.88] figured it out everybody anybody
[580.96 - 589.12] involved people must have somehow come
[584.88 - 592.44] to some conclusion that we have
[589.12 - 594.92] masterminded we have found the key to
[592.44 - 597.20] all of it it's not about what we did
[594.92 - 599.60] before we were doing it all wrong it's
[597.20 - 601.76] micro doing that's the answer now now
[599.60 - 604.48] and it's proven there must be something
[601.76 - 607.40] behind it it's ingenious it works it
[604.48 - 611.72] feels safe and then you hear another
[607.40 - 614.64] term or word associated with micro doing
[611.72 - 616.76] attached to it it's called The Plant
[614.64 - 619.80] medicine you hear that word plant
[616.76 - 622.52] medicine and suddenly you're like whoa
[619.80 - 625.28] and the term plant medicine holds power
[622.52 - 627.60] because we know plants are important we
[625.28 - 630.36] know plants do have medicine in them one
[627.60 - 631.88] way or another and we feel comfortable
[630.36 - 634.80] with the term plant
[631.88 - 637.16] medicine that word plant and that word
[634.80 - 640.92] medicine combined with micro doing and
[637.16 - 643.40] we're sold we're done sign me up what's
[640.92 - 646.20] interesting is we only use that term
[643.40 - 648.12] plant medicine or people in the health
[646.20 - 651.08] movement only use that term plant
[648.12 - 655.84] medicine when it's about something that
[651.08 - 657.84] is scary something that is toxic
[655.84 - 662.24] something that may not be good for you
[657.84 - 664.68] in small dosages or certainly not large
[662.24 - 666.68] dosages something that could even be
[664.68 - 669.56] dangerous and that's where the term
[666.68 - 672.08] plant medicine falls in the term plant
[669.56 - 675.12] medicine around substances that are
[672.08 - 676.88] toxic reminds me of a carjacker you just
[675.12 - 679.04] call a car
[676.88 - 682.60] borrower and the strange thing is
[679.04 - 685.48] there's no scale from 1 to 10 on how
[682.60 - 688.68] mean or bad that carjacker is just like
[685.48 - 691.76] there's no scale between 1 to 10 on how
[688.68 - 694.08] talkx IC that plant medicine is some
[691.76 - 697.56] plant medicine could be considered soloc
[694.08 - 700.36] cybin mushrooms and one mushroom can
[697.56 - 702.36] pack a wall up versus another mushroom
[700.36 - 705.12] that can just have you barfing and sick
[702.36 - 707.20] all night and another mushroom that
[705.12 - 709.56] could have your liver shutting down in 7
[707.20 - 712.20] days or your kidneys on the edge of
[709.56 - 715.48] failure but yet you could pack it all up
[712.20 - 718.36] to plant medicine that's all just like a
[715.48 - 719.48] carjacker one carjacker might punch your
[718.36 - 721.96] window in
[719.48 - 725.04] grab you pull you through the window cut
[721.96 - 727.88] you up really bad hop in the car and
[725.04 - 730.32] drive it over you on the way out another
[727.88 - 733.16] carjacker might just come up to you and
[730.32 - 736.16] say Sir ma'am get out of the car I'm
[733.16 - 739.32] taking it or just like that one mushroom
[736.16 - 741.28] that almost caused liver failure or that
[739.32 - 744.40] one mushroom that almost shut down your
[741.28 - 746.48] kidneys after a week the carjacker just
[744.40 - 749.12] puts a gun to the window shoots a bullet
[746.48 - 751.92] through it hits your face and then takes
[749.12 - 754.44] your car there's no scale there's no
[751.92 - 757.32] measurement there's no way to measure it
[754.44 - 760.44] it's just the term plant medicine the
[757.32 - 763.24] thing is really the term plant medicine
[760.44 - 766.24] should be all about fruits leafy greens
[763.24 - 769.96] herbs wild Foods vegetables that are not
[766.24 - 773.48] mind altering in a bad way or adrenaline
[769.96 - 775.92] surging in a bad way sources of plant
[773.48 - 778.20] chemical compounds that actually help us
[775.92 - 779.52] heal plant medicine should be about
[778.20 - 783.12] blackberri
[779.52 - 787.12] wild blueberries lemon balm Rosemary
[783.12 - 789.52] Ginger thyme celery spinach cilantro
[787.12 - 792.00] shitake mushrooms that's just a few
[789.52 - 795.16] example instead plant medicine is being
[792.00 - 797.60] used to give benediction to psilocybin
[795.16 - 802.96] mushrooms also known as magic mushrooms
[797.60 - 805.36] or shrooms iasa or even cacao matcha tea
[802.96 - 808.44] green tea and then if you leave plant
[805.36 - 809.72] medicine you go into toad medicine frog
[808.44 - 811.72] poison
[809.72 - 815.00] the alternative and conventional
[811.72 - 817.36] medicine world has a lot in common with
[815.00 - 820.56] the micro doing world and plant medicine
[817.36 - 823.60] world what's in common they both don't
[820.56 - 826.84] know why people are sick still bold
[823.60 - 829.56] statement true and there's a reason for
[826.84 - 832.36] it no one knows why someone has anxiety
[829.56 - 837.48] depression bipolar disorder
[832.36 - 840.16] OCD nobody knows why they have it no one
[837.48 - 843.52] knows why people really have brain fog
[840.16 - 846.80] fatigue or a marad of other neurological
[843.52 - 849.08] symptoms nobody knows why someone has
[846.80 - 851.60] autoimmune no one knows why someone's
[849.08 - 853.96] living with a painful chronic condition
[851.60 - 856.88] and chronic symptoms that plague them
[853.96 - 858.64] for years and even decades in their life
[856.88 - 861.60] conventional and alternative medicine
[858.64 - 865.32] don't know why someone has anxiety and
[861.60 - 868.36] plant medicine and micro doing world
[865.32 - 871.60] don't know why someone has anxiety it's
[868.36 - 873.56] all one big guessing game soup the
[871.60 - 876.20] conventional doctor doesn't know why you
[873.56 - 878.56] have depression yet offers you an
[876.20 - 880.00] anti-depressant the alternative doctor
[878.56 - 882.52] doesn't know why you have depression
[880.00 - 884.36] either yet offers you a better diet
[882.52 - 886.12] regular exercise routine the
[884.36 - 888.28] recommendation to get rid of processed
[886.12 - 890.60] foods and the instruction to take some
[888.28 - 892.80] vitamin D and
[890.60 - 894.92] multivitamin not every doctor visits
[892.80 - 897.40] going to yield the same recommendations
[894.92 - 898.84] it could vary it could be anything
[897.40 - 901.76] perhaps your doctor believes you have a
[898.84 - 904.40] gut problem maybe have sibo or candida
[901.76 - 907.04] leaky gut a microbiome issue maybe
[904.40 - 908.68] that's to blame maybe your conventional
[907.04 - 911.80] doctor believes you have a chemical
[908.68 - 914.52] imbalance or a neurotransmitter issue
[911.80 - 916.96] dopamine deficiency whatever the case
[914.52 - 919.96] it's still a case of guessing games we
[916.96 - 922.64] don't know why you're sick we don't know
[919.96 - 924.96] why you have depression or any other
[922.64 - 927.04] chronic symptom but the guessing games
[924.96 - 929.28] don't stop there with alternative
[927.04 - 932.32] medicine conventional medicine
[929.28 - 934.72] they Branch out widespread interest in
[932.32 - 937.24] psychedelics and micro doing the same
[934.72 - 939.88] guessing game technique leads us there
[937.24 - 942.28] too someone search for anything to try
[939.88 - 945.08] any answers it leads them to the door of
[942.28 - 947.76] the darker side of plant medicine I've
[945.08 - 951.56] heard this argument a 100 times out
[947.76 - 954.80] there or more psychedelics micro doing
[951.56 - 958.04] is ancient and because it's Ancient
[954.80 - 960.80] Ancient medicine then it's safe it's
[958.04 - 963.08] been happening for thousands of years
[960.80 - 965.76] this is not to disrespect anyone
[963.08 - 968.32] involved in iasa ceremonies or any kind
[965.76 - 970.88] of indigenous technique of spiritual
[968.32 - 973.68] healing indigenous cultures have also
[970.88 - 975.84] grown bananas indigenous cultures have
[973.68 - 978.52] also grown spices such as vanilla bean
[975.84 - 981.20] cinnamon turmeric and ginger these are
[978.52 - 982.84] non-toxic and have healing properties
[981.20 - 986.16] well some of these can be self-limiting
[982.84 - 989.68] and irritating in large quantities keep
[986.16 - 992.64] that in mind they're not dangerous
[989.68 - 995.76] at the same time though whether we're an
[992.64 - 999.20] indigenous culture or not we can all
[995.76 - 1001.92] grow eat and play around with poisons
[999.20 - 1003.88] many non-indigenous people become guides
[1001.92 - 1006.48] or practitioners who administer
[1003.88 - 1010.08] psychedelics and even toad and frog
[1006.48 - 1011.68] poison when someone out there Falls ill
[1010.08 - 1013.88] they have a lot of different symptoms
[1011.68 - 1015.88] now they're struggling mentally
[1013.88 - 1018.60] emotionally they have mental health
[1015.88 - 1020.68] issues because of the condition and it's
[1018.60 - 1022.56] even part of their symptoms and they're
[1020.68 - 1025.64] looking for answers to their chronic
[1022.56 - 1029.16] illness and they're desperate to try
[1025.64 - 1032.40] anything and then they get further
[1029.16 - 1034.16] injured in the process Landing a life of
[1032.40 - 1037.04] much more suffering and hardship than
[1034.16 - 1040.16] they already had with their condition
[1037.04 - 1042.28] people in their lives may pass it off as
[1040.16 - 1046.08] I had a bad trip cuz I did the frog
[1042.28 - 1048.72] poison and the toad poison or the iasa
[1046.08 - 1050.96] or I did something else people can pass
[1048.72 - 1053.76] it off like you just had a bad Trip Man
[1050.96 - 1056.20] sweep it under the carpet call it a day
[1053.76 - 1057.84] it was your journey and that's something
[1056.20 - 1060.00] that people are told it's like that was
[1057.84 - 1062.44] your journey that was the
[1060.00 - 1066.04] process and they'll say It was supposed
[1062.44 - 1069.08] to happen it was meant to be they had to
[1066.04 - 1071.60] learn something from it you grow from it
[1069.08 - 1073.84] meanwhile it was an injury and not a
[1071.60 - 1076.68] positive experience of any kind for
[1073.84 - 1078.92] anyone and maybe no one even realizes
[1076.68 - 1081.88] that their brain health is declining
[1078.92 - 1085.88] from that injury and maybe no one knows
[1081.88 - 1087.92] it or understands it but either way they
[1085.88 - 1089.88] could easily have a steady decline in
[1087.92 - 1091.32] their health because of that trip or
[1089.88 - 1094.44] that psychedelic
[1091.32 - 1099.12] experience the term micro doing makes us
[1094.44 - 1101.40] feel safe ah micro doing to the human
[1099.12 - 1104.36] psyche micro doing also implies that
[1101.40 - 1108.08] there's some kind of scientific nature
[1104.36 - 1109.96] involved we feel secure in the sense
[1108.08 - 1113.00] that there must be some kind of Science
[1109.96 - 1114.92] advising it that some type of study has
[1113.00 - 1117.80] been done there must have been a whole
[1114.92 - 1119.40] bunch of studies that proves efficacy
[1117.80 - 1123.04] but maybe you learned this already in
[1119.40 - 1126.00] your life or maybe we all know this that
[1123.04 - 1128.80] scientific studies are just a whole
[1126.00 - 1132.76] bunch of never-ending games of trial and
[1128.80 - 1135.20] error theories that become outdated by
[1132.76 - 1138.64] other theories and more theories than
[1135.20 - 1142.40] supersede those theories labeling drug
[1138.64 - 1146.16] use as micro doing provides a sense of
[1142.40 - 1148.64] safety to a wider variety of people now
[1146.16 - 1151.80] it's tempting to many more people who
[1148.64 - 1152.76] would have never ever gone there never
[1151.80 - 1156.16] would have
[1152.76 - 1159.44] partaken any way possible unless they
[1156.16 - 1162.20] felt that warm fuzzy feeling that
[1159.44 - 1164.56] science might be behind it and micro
[1162.20 - 1167.20] doing and psychedelics are no longer for
[1164.56 - 1169.52] that Niche crowd of people who just go
[1167.20 - 1172.16] into the desert sit around a campfire
[1169.52 - 1175.80] and drink a whole bowl of psychedelics
[1172.16 - 1179.08] marketing has happened a tactic that
[1175.80 - 1182.16] pulls in a much bigger crowd and that
[1179.08 - 1184.28] crowd got bigger and bigger and bigger
[1182.16 - 1186.48] because they're looking for Relief so
[1184.28 - 1189.00] they're doing everything in Edibles and
[1186.48 - 1192.36] all kinds of micro doing left and right
[1189.00 - 1195.16] to a point where big Pharma is like no
[1192.36 - 1197.16] no no no no no we need to bank on this
[1195.16 - 1199.76] so big Pharma are going to be taking
[1197.16 - 1202.28] over the Psychedelic world soon and big
[1199.76 - 1206.84] Pharma is going to be in charge of the
[1202.28 - 1210.12] dosages the micro doing micro doing
[1206.84 - 1212.84] takes on an air of intelligence
[1210.12 - 1214.16] something intellectual about it so when
[1212.84 - 1216.36] you're talking to someone they're like
[1214.16 - 1218.24] hey micro doing try this you can micro
[1216.36 - 1220.76] do that here's a psychedelic here's some
[1218.24 - 1222.76] toad poison you can micro do this you
[1220.76 - 1225.08] can do these micro doed Edibles it's
[1222.76 - 1226.92] like whoa you're smart there's something
[1225.08 - 1229.84] intelligent about hearing that it's like
[1226.92 - 1233.24] wow this is a smart guy or a smart
[1229.84 - 1234.76] person or this is seems intelligent here
[1233.24 - 1238.16] there's something behind here it's
[1234.76 - 1239.84] educated smart and well educated in the
[1238.16 - 1241.96] process that they're actually trying to
[1239.84 - 1243.52] push on you it's like whoa this sounds
[1241.96 - 1246.36] like a good thing and that guy's really
[1243.52 - 1249.24] smart and maybe that person is really
[1246.36 - 1251.48] smart maybe they are intelligent maybe
[1249.24 - 1254.40] it's true to some degree that the person
[1251.48 - 1257.20] offering a micro doing technique knows a
[1254.40 - 1259.84] lot about the theory yet even if you
[1257.20 - 1262.72] know a lot about a game it's still a
[1259.84 - 1266.32] game just being straight out here
[1262.72 - 1268.12] whether or not anyone wants to hear this
[1266.32 - 1271.08] there's still going to be a lot of
[1268.12 - 1273.72] people injured from psychedelics people
[1271.08 - 1277.16] who went into it into micro doing
[1273.72 - 1279.32] therapies with a migraine for example or
[1277.16 - 1281.40] something else and ended up with worse
[1279.32 - 1284.12] migraines because of it and you're going
[1281.40 - 1286.48] to hear more and more of that come out
[1284.12 - 1288.20] down the road it's going to be a wave of
[1286.48 - 1289.84] people and they're going to like oh my
[1288.20 - 1291.20] God I've been injured by this you're
[1289.84 - 1293.44] going to hear it out there it takes a
[1291.20 - 1296.36] little time because right now it's
[1293.44 - 1298.96] uncool to complain when you're doing the
[1296.36 - 1301.36] micro doing you just better be quiet and
[1298.96 - 1303.68] deal with it deal with the journey deal
[1301.36 - 1306.16] with what it is any bad experience was
[1303.68 - 1307.64] just spiritual and move on but there's
[1306.16 - 1310.64] going to be a lot of people that are
[1307.64 - 1312.24] going to be like no I have to speak out
[1310.64 - 1315.60] it's going to shift and you're going to
[1312.24 - 1318.72] see it out there what psychedelics do is
[1315.60 - 1320.20] put the body in a crisis state
[1318.72 - 1322.76] so when you're taking some of these
[1320.20 - 1326.00] psychedelics the body goes instantly
[1322.76 - 1328.76] into a crisis State when we go through a
[1326.00 - 1332.32] crisis State and come out of it we
[1328.76 - 1334.96] change in some way as a person it's like
[1332.32 - 1337.68] surviving a 10ar pile up on the freeway
[1334.96 - 1339.76] your car flips over two or three times
[1337.68 - 1342.16] you're tossed about and you seem to get
[1339.76 - 1344.40] out of the car walk out of it alive with
[1342.16 - 1347.48] a mild concussion while others around
[1344.40 - 1351.08] you died there's something that happens
[1347.48 - 1353.60] inside of us when we survive any kind of
[1351.08 - 1356.16] Crisis whatsoever and that falls into
[1353.60 - 1359.48] spiritual change and when we induce
[1356.16 - 1363.08] ourselves with a toxic chemical compound
[1359.48 - 1367.40] that throws our body into chaos after it
[1363.08 - 1371.36] subsides we feel we spiritually grew the
[1367.40 - 1374.20] addiction process this is a big one the
[1371.36 - 1375.76] addiction process that occurs with any
[1374.20 - 1378.88] dose of
[1375.76 - 1383.20] psychedelics the addiction to
[1378.88 - 1386.16] how did we survive that what a heck of a
[1383.20 - 1389.44] ride my spiritual teacher told me how
[1386.16 - 1392.48] much I've grown by doing it I think I'm
[1389.44 - 1395.04] ready to do it again one of the
[1392.48 - 1398.40] addictive aspects of psychedelics is the
[1395.04 - 1401.80] adrenaline surge the roller coaster ride
[1398.40 - 1404.80] it's when any poison or toxin hits the
[1401.80 - 1408.24] bloodstream the adrenaline
[1404.80 - 1410.88] explodes poisons enter our bloodstream
[1408.24 - 1414.60] and that adrenaline surge happens the
[1410.88 - 1417.56] roller coaster ride that poison is
[1414.60 - 1421.72] foreign the psychedelics the frog toad
[1417.56 - 1425.40] poison the psilocybin iasa it's all
[1421.72 - 1427.28] foreign to the body your body has to
[1425.40 - 1431.76] protect the brain so your adrenals
[1427.28 - 1434.52] release a blow a spill a massive spill
[1431.76 - 1438.12] of adrenaline it becomes a steroid
[1434.52 - 1440.60] compound instantly steroids are there to
[1438.12 - 1443.80] try to stop a crisis it's your natural
[1440.60 - 1447.52] steroid maker your adrenals release that
[1443.80 - 1449.96] steroid your adrenaline to stop the blow
[1447.52 - 1453.24] from being hard to the brain heart and
[1449.96 - 1455.68] lungs so it doesn't take a hit so hard a
[1453.24 - 1458.80] micro do of psychedelics triggers off a
[1455.68 - 1462.28] brain alarm because the brain starts to
[1458.80 - 1465.60] get poisoned the brain then sends an
[1462.28 - 1467.80] emergency signal to the brain stem and
[1465.60 - 1470.16] then out to your adrenals looking for
[1467.80 - 1473.40] for the adrenals to save your
[1470.16 - 1475.20] brain and that intense adrenaline blend
[1473.40 - 1477.80] that's pouring out spilling out of your
[1475.20 - 1480.56] adrenals is released to stop Strokes
[1477.80 - 1483.32] from occurring and blood clots from
[1480.56 - 1487.24] forming that adrenaline is there to thin
[1483.32 - 1489.52] out the blood and open up blood vessels
[1487.24 - 1491.88] because guess what the blood vessels are
[1489.52 - 1493.76] starting to close so the steroid
[1491.88 - 1496.32] compounds in the adrenaline are there to
[1493.76 - 1499.48] keep the blood vessels open so they're
[1496.32 - 1500.96] not getting shut down swell and close
[1499.48 - 1504.80] down from the
[1500.96 - 1507.92] poisons yo dude get in here man it's on
[1504.80 - 1510.72] TV now check out this commercial yeah I
[1507.92 - 1512.76] love it is there anyone out there who
[1510.72 - 1516.92] still isn't clear about what doing drugs
[1512.76 - 1516.92] does okay last
[1518.44 - 1524.12] time this is your
[1520.76 - 1524.12] brain this is
[1524.70 - 1528.80] [Applause]
[1526.68 - 1531.72] drugs
[1528.80 - 1531.72] this is your brain on
[1532.20 - 1538.44] drugs any
[1534.88 - 1540.96] questions when a toxin from psychedelics
[1538.44 - 1543.32] or like toad poison psychedelics frog
[1540.96 - 1546.52] poison psychedelics enters into our
[1543.32 - 1549.68] bloodstream our immune system sees it as
[1546.52 - 1552.44] an Invader as a psychedelic poison
[1549.68 - 1555.36] enters our bloodstream our immune cells
[1552.44 - 1559.68] try to devour it and when our immune
[1555.36 - 1562.76] systems try to devour it it bulks up our
[1559.68 - 1565.64] immune cells climb on top of each other
[1562.76 - 1568.84] it becomes a ball like a big snowball
[1565.64 - 1571.20] rolling down a hill a mountain more and
[1568.84 - 1573.76] more immune cells keep on coming to Aid
[1571.20 - 1575.16] the other immune cells and they all try
[1573.76 - 1579.44] to Devour the
[1575.16 - 1581.68] poison this leads to a small blood clot
[1579.44 - 1584.16] developing our immune system has an
[1581.68 - 1586.96] intelligence built into it our immune
[1584.16 - 1588.36] cells know that a small blood clot is
[1586.96 - 1591.16] developing
[1588.36 - 1594.72] our immune cells also know something's
[1591.16 - 1596.76] coming to rescue it a corrosive
[1594.72 - 1600.56] substance something that's coming from
[1596.76 - 1604.60] our adrenal glands something that can
[1600.56 - 1607.80] dissolve the blood clot something that's
[1604.60 - 1611.00] strong now adrenaline isn't as strong as
[1607.80 - 1614.04] kerosene it's not like paint thinner but
[1611.00 - 1617.40] it's strong in its own way it's there to
[1614.04 - 1619.80] thin out the blood it's there to destroy
[1617.40 - 1622.48] the the blood clot that the immune cells
[1619.80 - 1624.72] were building by devouring the poison
[1622.48 - 1627.52] it's there to separate that blood clot
[1624.72 - 1630.72] to send the immune cells on their way
[1627.52 - 1634.76] with the poison inside of them this
[1630.72 - 1638.44] lowers the blow to the brain this
[1634.76 - 1640.52] process lowers the blow that the toxins
[1638.44 - 1644.28] from the Frog poison toad poison or
[1640.52 - 1647.08] psychedelics or iasa psilocybin or
[1644.28 - 1649.64] whatever it lowers the blow to the brain
[1647.08 - 1652.80] stem in the brain and then that
[1649.64 - 1656.24] adrenaline opens up the passageways like
[1652.80 - 1658.72] a steroid so there's less constriction
[1656.24 - 1661.40] in blood vessels in the brain and other
[1658.72 - 1664.04] places in the body so that poisons that
[1661.40 - 1666.80] the person ingested can leave the brain
[1664.04 - 1667.96] and body easier this whole process
[1666.80 - 1670.68] becomes
[1667.96 - 1673.52] chaos this chaos is part of the
[1670.68 - 1675.72] addiction process of psychedelics the
[1673.52 - 1677.52] adrenaline that's released to thin out
[1675.72 - 1679.96] the blood so that the person does
[1677.52 - 1682.12] doesn't stroke out also goes into the
[1679.96 - 1685.24] brain and gives the person the ultimate
[1682.12 - 1687.72] high at the very same time the chemical
[1685.24 - 1689.68] compounds the toxins in the psychedelics
[1687.72 - 1692.48] are saturating neurons causing
[1689.68 - 1695.96] hallucinogenic effects it's this
[1692.48 - 1698.80] combination of that big adrenaline high
[1695.96 - 1702.16] from that big adrenaline burst to save
[1698.80 - 1706.40] the person to keep them safe as much as
[1702.16 - 1708.00] possible combined with the toxin itself
[1706.40 - 1711.64] from the psychedelics
[1708.00 - 1714.84] gives the person the addiction and then
[1711.64 - 1718.32] there's the aftermath what goes up must
[1714.84 - 1721.56] come down the aftermath is the coming
[1718.32 - 1723.92] down part the adrenaline high now
[1721.56 - 1726.48] leaving your body and becoming an
[1723.92 - 1729.08] adrenaline low our body is in the
[1726.48 - 1731.72] process of recovery now as the poisonous
[1729.08 - 1732.60] chemical compounds from the psychedelics
[1731.72 - 1736.40] are
[1732.60 - 1740.52] dissipating and we survived it we
[1736.40 - 1743.32] survived a another night or another day
[1740.52 - 1745.44] it's not exactly the same as being in a
[1743.32 - 1747.76] party where you got totally completely
[1745.44 - 1749.80] drunk and stoned and puked in the
[1747.76 - 1752.72] bathroom all night long and then spent
[1749.80 - 1754.76] the next day in a stoer and a hangover
[1752.72 - 1756.40] yet there are
[1754.76 - 1760.00] similarities
[1756.40 - 1763.52] regardless whichever toxin or compound
[1760.00 - 1766.20] or substance you sent through your body
[1763.52 - 1768.48] you went into survival mode they're
[1766.20 - 1770.84] parties you'll never forget get
[1768.48 - 1772.64] experiences that become etched in your
[1770.84 - 1775.48] Consciousness the parties we never
[1772.64 - 1777.72] forget aren't cures for depression the
[1775.48 - 1779.32] parties that we go and do aren't the
[1777.72 - 1781.84] parties that actually get rid of our
[1779.32 - 1784.08] anxiety in the end the parties we never
[1781.84 - 1787.56] forget don't get rid of our brain fog or
[1784.08 - 1791.00] fatigue or neurological symptoms the
[1787.56 - 1793.88] parties we never forget only worsen them
[1791.00 - 1796.08] one of the saddest parts of psychedelics
[1793.88 - 1799.72] is knowing that somebody out there
[1796.08 - 1802.64] 25-year-old or 28-year-old or anyone who
[1799.72 - 1804.88] doesn't have any idea why they're sick
[1802.64 - 1805.84] they've seen a number of doctors tried a
[1804.88 - 1808.12] number of
[1805.84 - 1810.88] medications they can't find relief
[1808.12 - 1814.32] mentally or physically and then they
[1810.88 - 1816.72] stumble into the world of this can heal
[1814.32 - 1819.80] you physically and spiritually just try
[1816.72 - 1822.36] this micro doing it's one thing if
[1819.80 - 1825.12] you're not healing so you take some
[1822.36 - 1827.88] junky vitamins or try a range of animal
[1825.12 - 1829.64] protein and plant-based diets try a few
[1827.88 - 1831.64] different therapies and healing
[1829.64 - 1834.00] techniques try conventional
[1831.64 - 1836.32] Pharmaceuticals and you're still stuck
[1834.00 - 1838.60] and you're still sick that's a better
[1836.32 - 1841.40] place to be than getting caught up in
[1838.60 - 1844.56] the world of psychedelics believing that
[1841.40 - 1847.48] maybe you have a spiritual block that's
[1844.56 - 1850.20] keeping you physically ill when we lose
[1847.48 - 1852.60] time and we're really exhausted and we
[1850.20 - 1856.16] don't have answers that are working or
[1852.60 - 1859.96] helping the next easy cell is it has to
[1856.16 - 1863.44] be you you're the problem this is a
[1859.96 - 1866.28] spiritual issue a mental and emotional
[1863.44 - 1868.88] problem the psychedelics will shift
[1866.28 - 1871.60] something within you you'll be told
[1868.88 - 1873.88] bring you to more spiritual growth take
[1871.60 - 1876.56] you on a spiritual journey or problems
[1873.88 - 1878.56] can be solved so the outcomes in how you
[1876.56 - 1881.48] feel physically and emotionally can
[1878.56 - 1883.24] improve and be healed or you'll start
[1881.48 - 1885.48] hearing that the psychedelics will
[1883.24 - 1888.40] change your brain chemistry on a
[1885.48 - 1891.64] scientific level so that you can find
[1888.40 - 1895.04] relief symptom relief relief of chronic
[1891.64 - 1898.28] illness and there's some type of
[1895.04 - 1900.76] systematic chemistry that changes inside
[1898.28 - 1903.36] the brain when applying
[1900.76 - 1907.48] psychedelics on even a pharmaceutical
[1903.36 - 1909.84] level in the future to find out more
[1907.48 - 1914.08] read medical medium brain
[1909.84 - 1916.64] saver many of us want to feel we have
[1914.08 - 1918.28] control over what we're putting inside
[1916.64 - 1921.44] our body
[1918.28 - 1924.80] micro doing gives us this false sense of
[1921.44 - 1927.64] security that we're in control our
[1924.80 - 1931.04] Consciousness and thought process can be
[1927.64 - 1934.96] very different from even defiant to what
[1931.04 - 1938.84] our body and soul really need or want we
[1934.96 - 1942.64] might say no micro doing is controlled
[1938.84 - 1944.92] it's careful I'm going to heal with this
[1942.64 - 1947.88] our physical brain and our metaphysical
[1944.92 - 1950.92] Soul are not saying that our physical
[1947.88 - 1954.36] brain is saying don't let that poison
[1950.92 - 1956.60] enter this Temple it doesn't matter if
[1954.36 - 1958.92] that's psychedelic is trendy right now
[1956.60 - 1963.08] in this time in history and in earlier
[1958.92 - 1966.28] times in history do not let it enter the
[1963.08 - 1970.80] temple the ghost that lives inside our
[1966.28 - 1973.56] brain our soul is saying don't shorten
