[71.84 - 74.84] got some Clues and we got some good
[73.12 - 76.80] ideas why people get heart disease but a
[74.84 - 80.16] lot lot of times it's mystery out there
[76.80 - 83.40] in the medical Arenas so but high blood
[80.16 - 85.76] pressure low blood pressure with no real
[83.40 - 88.48] evidence of heart
[85.76 - 92.04] disease arterial sclerosis or some kind
[88.48 - 94.92] of you know artery disease no real
[92.04 - 97.16] evidence of cardiovascular
[94.92 - 99.32] disease but yet having low blood
[97.16 - 103.72] pressure high blood pressure it's a
[99.32 - 104.88] mystery mystery mystery listen you don't
[103.72 - 108.48] think a lot of people have blood
[104.88 - 111.04] pressure problems everybody gets them
[108.48 - 114.44] someday everybody gets them whether
[111.04 - 117.72] they're eating way too much fat for a 50
[114.44 - 121.04] years and then then finally it catches
[117.72 - 122.12] up or they think you know they're eating
[121.04 - 124.24] pretty good and all is good and then
[122.12 - 128.36] there's just this mystery blood pressure
[124.24 - 130.64] problem either way almost everyone has
[128.36 - 132.64] to hear about it some way in their life
[130.64 - 134.84] whether they younger or older in one way
[132.64 - 137.60] or another so is this important yes it's
[134.84 - 139.12] a big one it's a big show I love it I
[137.60 - 141.20] love this one because this is an
[139.12 - 142.72] important show and I I really want to
[141.20 - 144.48] get people better get them feeling
[142.72 - 146.32] better so who has 10 years to wait to
[144.48 - 149.40] get answers let's do it now that's the
[146.32 - 151.12] whole point listen this is the only show
[149.40 - 153.00] where the information is not repackaged
[151.12 - 155.88] or recycled Theory that's what happens
[153.00 - 157.92] out there that's revolving the revolver
[155.88 - 159.64] the the the musical chairs of recycled
[157.92 - 161.32] repackaged information out there of
[159.64 - 162.60] theory it that's not what this show is
[161.32 - 164.32] the information here doesn't come from
[162.60 - 166.08] the medical interest groups that are
[164.32 - 167.44] contaminated in all the information out
[166.08 - 169.16] of their medical funding with strings
[167.44 - 171.64] attached botch research that's a thumb
[169.16 - 173.56] on the scale that's the whole thing paid
[171.64 - 175.48] and bought paid and bought and
[173.56 - 177.48] grandfathered in laws because of
[175.48 - 180.20] investors investing in money in botch
[177.48 - 181.64] research you know uh funky sign out
[180.20 - 184.28] there that everybody thinks is real but
[181.64 - 185.92] it's not lobbyists internal Kickbacks
[184.28 - 188.08] persuaded belief systems in the
[185.92 - 189.76] alternative and and and conventional
[188.08 - 191.36] medical Arenas private panels of
[189.76 - 192.64] influencers with money going underneath
[191.36 - 194.40] the table so the information is
[192.64 - 196.04] contaminated and then it gets cited and
[194.40 - 197.36] then peerreview studies and it goes into
[196.04 - 199.68] book after book and it doesn't get
[197.36 - 202.52] people better because it's contaminated
[199.68 - 204.20] or trendy traps yes I have to say that
[202.52 - 205.72] because guess what it's so important to
[204.20 - 207.32] know that it's important to know that
[205.72 - 208.20] the information in the show is the only
[207.32 - 210.32] this is the only show where the
[208.20 - 212.60] information is pure untampered with
[210.32 - 215.00] clean and that's the you know what you
[212.60 - 216.84] know let me tell you something if I had
[215.00 - 219.32] the op if I didn't have this gift if I
[216.84 - 220.80] didn't get this gift when I was age four
[219.32 - 222.08] of knowing what's going on in hearing
[220.80 - 224.00] spirit and having the information that
[222.08 - 225.20] was Advanced and ahead of decades ahead
[224.00 - 226.88] of that what's out there now with
[225.20 - 228.84] information and help hundreds of
[226.88 - 231.24] thousands of people over my whole
[228.84 - 232.92] lifetime if I didn't have that gift and
[231.24 - 235.88] I was just somebody out there looking
[232.92 - 237.84] for answers and I I just and i' I've
[235.88 - 240.20] been and I was burned left and right
[237.84 - 242.04] with reading different things and going
[240.20 - 244.16] different places and spending tons and
[242.04 - 246.64] tons of thousands of dollars and having
[244.16 - 248.52] a mystery illness or diagnosed Illness
[246.64 - 251.04] but who knows what was going on up and
[248.52 - 253.36] down wrong or right and I had a chance
[251.04 - 256.60] to hear information that wasn't attached
[253.36 - 259.40] to any of that stuff any of that junk
[256.60 - 261.76] science that was paid for out there
[259.40 - 263.84] attached to any of that contamination
[261.76 - 267.92] that I just mentioned if I had a chance
[263.84 - 270.36] to hear free information meaning free
[267.92 - 273.84] and clear from contamination
[270.36 - 275.92] that had truth in it and it was real if
[273.84 - 277.88] I had that chance I'd be like I'd be on
[275.92 - 279.84] it and be like okay no I'm listening to
[277.88 - 281.88] this because I understand I've been
[279.84 - 284.28] around the block I know what's going on
[281.88 - 286.00] I've suffered enough I know that I want
[284.28 - 287.32] to hear this instead of the garbage
[286.00 - 289.16] that's out there that's over and over
[287.32 - 291.48] again in the experts books of today that
[289.16 - 293.44] are unbelievable just recycled junk over
[291.48 - 295.28] and over again belief systems and so
[293.44 - 297.60] forth I would I would definitely want to
[295.28 - 299.28] hear so that's just me maybe you maybe
[297.60 - 301.40] you who tuned in the radio show you're
[299.28 - 303.48] not interested but I'd be interested
[301.40 - 304.56] 100% And I'd be interested to know about
[303.48 - 307.08] blood pressure cuz that's where we're
[304.56 - 309.12] going now so here we are let's get
[307.08 - 311.12] started with this how do we get high
[309.12 - 313.96] blood pressure let's talk about that
[311.12 - 315.24] first because you know that that's just
[313.96 - 317.96] that's important to know how do we get
[315.24 - 320.52] high blood pressure bad lifestyle we
[317.96 - 322.08] don't exercise so we don't exercise we
[320.52 - 323.40] have a bad lifestyle or something or not
[322.08 - 326.36] a healthy lifestyle we're eating too
[323.40 - 328.04] much processed food right and we start
[326.36 - 329.64] getting high blood pressure doctor says
[328.04 - 331.64] look you got to you got to be careful
[329.64 - 333.04] here you got to reduce your red meat I
[331.64 - 335.88] don't know if doctors are saying that
[333.04 - 338.00] anymore they're probably all pro pro red
[335.88 - 339.16] meat eat more red meat that's where they
[338.00 - 340.96] are now I think that's where it's
[339.16 - 342.40] shifting it's shifting now where all the
[340.96 - 343.96] medical doctors are like no matter what
[342.40 - 345.64] they are whether they're functional or
[343.96 - 347.32] regular conventional they're like no you
[345.64 - 349.52] got to eat more meat you just got to get
[347.32 - 351.56] rid of all fruit you know like fruit is
[349.52 - 353.60] the cause of high blood pressure like
[351.56 - 356.00] fruit like
[353.60 - 358.64] fruit like fruit is the cause of high
[356.00 - 360.52] blood pressure yeah okay I I'll buy that
[358.64 - 362.28] one you know but just like doctors are
[360.52 - 363.96] like you know at least they had
[362.28 - 365.60] something right a few years back I think
[363.96 - 369.52] it was about 10 years ago I think it was
[365.60 - 371.24] about 10 years ago um 10 12 15 years ago
[369.52 - 373.52] doctors like you know when people were
[371.24 - 375.76] having when they were having coming in
[373.52 - 377.84] with heart problems and or or high blood
[375.76 - 379.32] pressure and they were coming into the
[377.84 - 381.08] doctor's office they'd be like you got
[379.32 - 382.64] to lower your red meat and this was
[381.08 - 384.40] coming from conventional doctors I
[382.64 - 386.80] remember that day when it was happening
[384.40 - 390.48] and I was like finally something is
[386.80 - 394.24] going right in the industries
[390.48 - 396.36] finally something is going right and
[394.24 - 398.80] guess what now you don't hear that it's
[396.36 - 401.16] now it's just like no you need to eat
[398.80 - 402.28] more red meat but grass-fed that's all
[401.16 - 405.16] and you need to get rid of all your
[402.28 - 408.84] sugar so don't eat any
[405.16 - 411.20] fruit listen the whole the whole thing
[408.84 - 414.84] that happens with blood pressure to
[411.20 - 417.84] begin with comes from an organ in the
[414.84 - 421.76] body and it's not the heart it comes
[417.84 - 423.56] from it it deres es from an organ the
[421.76 - 425.32] problem can you guess what that organ is
[423.56 - 426.40] you know what that organ is you know
[425.32 - 428.08] what it is are you thinking are you
[426.40 - 429.76] thinking brain is that what you're
[428.08 - 432.44] thinking about what you're thinking
[429.76 - 435.04] pancreas maybe you're thinking colon
[432.44 - 438.08] maybe you're thinking gut maybe you're
[435.04 - 439.36] thinking kidneys you know and well
[438.08 - 440.80] kidneys has a little something to do
[439.36 - 443.20] with it if you have kidney problems you
[440.80 - 444.36] can get blood pressure problems but
[443.20 - 445.80] there's a reason why you would get
[444.36 - 449.76] kidney problems to begin with and what's
[445.80 - 451.08] that organ what is it you guys remember
[449.76 - 453.08] I might have talked about this before in
[451.08 - 457.96] an old show or something like that it's
[453.08 - 461.96] the liver the liver the liver that's the
[457.96 - 465.08] organ interesting right
[461.96 - 467.76] interesting the liver is responsible
[465.08 - 468.88] it's responsible for all mystery high
[467.76 - 473.40] blood
[468.88 - 476.96] pressure and mystery low blood
[473.40 - 480.12] pressure mystery high blood pressure
[476.96 - 481.96] mystery low blood pressure
[480.12 - 483.72] so in the high blood pressure Department
[481.96 - 486.48] how does this work what even happens
[483.72 - 492.56] what goes on first of all your heart
[486.48 - 494.56] your heart it gets its blood from where
[492.56 - 497.24] where does your heart get its blood from
[494.56 - 500.20] uh just the blood
[497.24 - 501.40] system from where does it get the blood
[500.20 - 503.32] from you know when you think about it
[501.40 - 506.16] it's like I don't know like where does
[503.32 - 508.24] it it gets it from your liver that's
[506.16 - 513.60] where your heart gets its blood
[508.24 - 516.88] from your liver has these hepatic portal
[513.60 - 519.60] highways hepatic portal highways that's
[516.88 - 522.48] what it is got the hepatic portal vein
[519.60 - 525.28] comes from your colon drives up all
[522.48 - 530.68] those nutrients so when you're eating
[525.28 - 533.60] food your food breaks down miraculously
[530.68 - 537.64] mysteriously inside your intestinal
[533.60 - 539.96] tract and then nutrients along with
[537.64 - 542.16] blood also
[539.96 - 545.28] like up amazing nutrients a little bit
[542.16 - 546.96] of oxygen all go up through these
[545.28 - 551.08] capillaries and blood vessels and find
[546.96 - 554.08] their way up the her hepatic
[551.08 - 556.20] vein hepatic vein in the portal system
[554.08 - 559.16] these are all the veins attached to your
[556.20 - 562.44] colon and intestinal tract and
[559.16 - 564.80] Elum all these veins and these veins
[562.44 - 567.76] where do they lead into a highway a
[564.80 - 569.76] massive Highway a massive Highway going
[567.76 - 571.36] into your liver
[569.76 - 574.00] your
[571.36 - 578.40] liver and so these veins are drawn
[574.00 - 582.40] blood's being sucked up sucked up these
[578.40 - 586.32] veins that's right that's right your
[582.40 - 588.64] heart's pumping and creating
[586.32 - 591.32] suction so your heart's pumping and
[588.64 - 594.64] creating suction so you see what I'm you
[591.32 - 596.72] see where I'm going here so it's as it's
[594.64 - 600.32] as it's creating suction it's drawing
[596.72 - 603.16] blood up these veins up the portal
[600.32 - 604.40] hepatic portal Highway the veins heading
[603.16 - 608.76] into the
[604.40 - 611.56] liver so you with me and those veins
[608.76 - 613.44] heading up to the liver they're all
[611.56 - 617.32] filled with
[613.44 - 620.16] blood blood that the heart's pumping and
[617.32 - 622.68] drawing and creating
[620.16 - 624.60] suction and what's that blood filled
[622.68 - 625.84] with I know I told you a little bit a
[624.60 - 628.64] couple minutes ago I just want to make
[625.84 - 630.76] sure you're on this with me filled with
[628.64 - 633.80] lots and lots of nutrients
[630.76 - 635.92] phytochemicals vitamins minerals trace
[633.80 - 642.64] minerals
[635.92 - 644.68] oxygen and water and water water so all
[642.64 - 646.88] that's being drawn up in that Highway of
[644.68 - 649.72] blood goes into your
[646.88 - 651.72] liver and a healthy liver is all happy
[649.72 - 653.80] and it's taking all this healthy blood
[651.72 - 655.32] in and a healthy liver is all happy it's
[653.80 - 657.32] taking all this healthy blood in and
[655.32 - 661.04] it's taking all this healthy blood in
[657.32 - 663.44] and then and then it releases that blood
[661.04 - 666.00] actually after it filters it it filters
[663.44 - 667.48] it and it's dispersing all the nutrients
[666.00 - 668.92] and everything they're going in all the
[667.48 - 670.60] right places in the liver and the liver
[668.92 - 674.48] is taking care of everything and the
[670.60 - 677.92] blood then exits it exits the liver and
[674.48 - 680.80] guess where it goes It goes to your
[677.92 - 682.52] heart it goes to your
[680.80 - 684.36] heart
[682.52 - 688.04] interesting
[684.36 - 689.92] interesting it's all packaged ready and
[688.04 - 693.72] happy going to the
[689.92 - 696.60] heart but guess what goes wrong guess
[693.72 - 698.64] what goes wrong guess what I didn't
[696.60 - 700.36] mention is in that blood and the hepatic
[698.64 - 702.12] in the hepatic veins heading from the
[700.36 - 703.72] colon to the liver to begin with
[702.12 - 705.92] remember I'll go back a little ways
[703.72 - 708.04] let's go back a couple of minutes
[705.92 - 709.52] remember what how I said there's water
[708.04 - 710.80] in that blood there's nutrients there's
[709.52 - 712.08] phytochemicals there's minerals there's
[710.80 - 713.96] trace minerals there's vitamins and
[712.08 - 717.96] oxygen all coming in guess what else is
[713.96 - 722.84] in that blood poison poison toxic
[717.96 - 725.60] poisons fat also fat cells from putrid
[722.84 - 730.32] fat from eating too much too much too
[725.60 - 735.36] much red meat lots of toxins and
[730.32 - 738.16] poisons heavy metals solvents for
[735.36 - 741.08] Malahide okay
[738.16 - 744.68] everything everything
[741.08 - 746.64] chlorine all right from Water Systems
[744.68 - 749.44] everything's going in
[746.64 - 753.00] there I mean it's a Flor
[749.44 - 755.64] all of it is just going in that Highway
[753.00 - 758.12] up to the liver lots and lots of Gunk
[755.64 - 760.28] and poison toxins and
[758.12 - 761.68] debris so even though that blood is
[760.28 - 763.20] filled with all this good stuff liquid
[761.68 - 765.04] is filled with too all this bad stuff
[763.20 - 767.64] and guess what the liver has to collect
[765.04 - 769.36] it filter it collect it filter it
[767.64 - 771.08] collect it filter it collect it and
[769.36 - 772.36] filter it and if we're not eating right
[771.08 - 774.76] and we're not taking care of ourselves
[772.36 - 778.28] and we're not doing the right things or
[774.76 - 781.00] the liver's already burdened and already
[778.28 - 784.12] held back from poisons and toxins it
[781.00 - 786.12] inherited from birth and Beyond where
[784.12 - 788.44] you it's inherited all the toxins the
[786.12 - 790.28] old DDT you know the unforgiving for who
[788.44 - 791.40] has life-changing Foods who has
[790.28 - 794.92] life-changing Foods my book
[791.40 - 797.64] life-changing foods do you guys have it
[794.92 - 800.92] if anyone said I don't have
[797.64 - 803.08] it if anyone says I don't have it I'll
[800.92 - 805.08] just smack myself in the head or I'll
[803.08 - 806.76] bang my head on my desk right now let me
[805.08 - 809.32] just do that let me just hit my head or
[806.76 - 811.68] bang it against the wall
[809.32 - 813.52] because you're missing out I didn't I
[811.68 - 816.28] didn't kill
[813.52 - 818.76] myself to take all the information from
[816.28 - 821.48] Spirit and put it in life-changing food
[818.76 - 823.60] so you so you wouldn't get the book
[821.48 - 827.20] because in that book has the unforgiving
[823.60 - 830.24] four because in that Highway of
[827.20 - 831.96] nastiness the blood toxicity along with
[830.24 - 833.76] all that good I mentioned that's heading
[831.96 - 835.36] up to the liver up the hepatic portal
[833.76 - 838.08] highway coming from the colon heading
[835.36 - 840.12] all the way up to the liver all that
[838.08 - 843.56] toxic and poisonous stuff is the
[840.12 - 845.08] unforgiving for it's old DDT that was
[843.56 - 846.48] inside the liver to begin with it's
[845.08 - 848.64] pesticides and herbicides that are
[846.48 - 850.16] actually now in our all in our you know
[848.64 - 851.88] way now that we deal with every day
[850.16 - 854.04] going up the blood oh going right in the
[851.88 - 857.00] bloodstream there's all of that there's
[854.04 - 858.96] also bacteria viral issues issues viral
[857.00 - 861.52] byproduct all that stuff and even a
[858.96 - 864.08] little radiation all that is going up
[861.52 - 866.52] the hepatic portal
[864.08 - 868.08] Highway and it gets into the liver if
[866.52 - 870.28] the liver doesn't already have it in
[868.08 - 871.80] there already to begin with and as this
[870.28 - 873.28] goes into the liver and it saturates the
[871.80 - 876.84] liver and saturates the liver the liver
[873.28 - 880.52] starts getting doggish and the Heart
[876.84 - 882.28] relying on clean blood clean mean
[880.52 - 885.80] machine
[882.28 - 889.20] blood the heart relying on
[885.80 - 892.12] it is pumping harder and
[889.20 - 895.00] harder because the filter is getting
[892.12 - 898.12] thicker dirtier stagnant more sluggish
[895.00 - 899.52] more doggish and when that and when that
[898.12 - 901.20] livers get getting filled with more and
[899.52 - 902.80] more of that stuff and we're not eating
[901.20 - 905.36] right and and
[902.80 - 908.00] instead instead we you know we we head
[905.36 - 910.28] off to a high trendy high fat diet of
[908.00 - 912.44] the day the flavor of the day that you
[910.28 - 914.72] see on say a doctor show or you see out
[912.44 - 917.28] there and you see some fancy new diet
[914.72 - 919.12] fancy new book or something and we head
[917.28 - 921.04] to that direction and we quit the
[919.12 - 924.12] processed foods we start exercising we
[921.04 - 929.36] may help the liver a little
[924.12 - 931.52] bit but a little bit isn't enough
[929.36 - 933.88] it isn't enough because it'll sneak up
[931.52 - 936.44] on you and it'll bite you in the butt
[933.88 - 937.84] later it'll sneak up on you and bite you
[936.44 - 939.80] in the butt and you'll get that high
[937.84 - 941.20] blood pressure down the road or you'll
[939.80 - 943.00] get that low blood pressure or you'll
[941.20 - 945.12] get a blood pressure problem one way or
[943.00 - 947.48] another down the
[945.12 - 950.84] road down the
[947.48 - 953.64] road and you'll get that well that will
[950.84 - 957.04] happen even on you know a fancy cute
[953.64 - 959.56] diet because it's not addressing the
[957.04 - 961.72] real problem
[959.56 - 963.64] and the the liver still getting dirty
[961.72 - 965.60] along the way and still getting flooded
[963.64 - 967.16] with poisons and still get it FL getting
[965.60 - 969.32] flooded with
[967.16 - 970.84] toxins so we're going to cover all that
[969.32 - 972.72] a little bit about what foods to do for
[970.84 - 974.60] high blood pressure what we can eat what
[972.72 - 977.00] we can do to knock high blood pressure
[974.60 - 979.96] down and what we can do to stabilize
[977.00 - 983.12] blood pressure this is this is exciting
[979.96 - 985.12] this is an exciting one so what happens
[983.12 - 987.08] is when that liver gets filled and toxic
[985.12 - 988.60] and stagnant and sluggish and doggish
[987.08 - 991.40] and filled with poisons what happen
[988.60 - 995.08] happens you guys is the heart has to
[991.40 - 996.52] pump harder and harder and harder and
[995.08 - 999.96] the
[996.52 - 1002.48] blood the blood isn't easy to come out
[999.96 - 1004.60] of the liver it's not easy it's not free
[1002.48 - 1007.88] flowing out of the liver so easy so
[1004.60 - 1009.88] there's pressure the suction occurs more
[1007.88 - 1012.20] suction has to happen it's like sipping
[1009.88 - 1015.24] through a straw instead of sipping water
[1012.20 - 1018.64] through a straw you're
[1015.24 - 1020.40] sipping something else through a straw
[1018.64 - 1022.40] you're sipping like a
[1020.40 - 1024.96] milkshake thick
[1022.40 - 1027.24] milkshake or then you're then you're
[1024.96 - 1031.16] sipping Jello-O through a
[1027.24 - 1034.64] straw how about that one trying to sip
[1031.16 - 1035.88] sip Jello-O through a straw and so
[1034.64 - 1038.52] that's what
[1035.88 - 1041.28] occurs and what happens is your liver
[1038.52 - 1043.32] gets it gets dirty it's gets sluggish it
[1041.28 - 1045.20] gets sick and then your blood gets dirty
[1043.32 - 1047.40] and gets thick and your blood becomes
[1045.20 - 1049.64] dirty and thick and then you're eating
[1047.40 - 1051.44] more High fats more High fats whatever
[1049.64 - 1053.24] diet you believe in whatever belief
[1051.44 - 1055.24] system you've been sucked into you're
[1053.24 - 1056.80] eating a higher fat diet without
[1055.24 - 1058.72] realizing it even if you're doing
[1056.80 - 1061.52] plant-based high fat even if you're
[1058.72 - 1063.12] doing Paleo High fat or some autoimmune
[1061.52 - 1064.76] high fat whatever you choose you're
[1063.12 - 1066.72] doing you think it's high protein but
[1064.76 - 1068.32] it's all high fat and you're doing more
[1066.72 - 1070.96] high fat and what's happening is your
[1068.32 - 1072.96] blood's getting more dehydrated thicker
[1070.96 - 1075.24] and thicker and thicker unless you
[1072.96 - 1078.20] unless you're doing things to offset the
[1075.24 - 1080.40] high fat diet a lot more juicing a
[1078.20 - 1082.40] little a little less red meat and then
[1080.40 - 1083.96] you know it won't get so thick but if
[1082.40 - 1086.44] you're not it's still going to get thick
[1083.96 - 1089.24] in the end it's still going to get thick
[1086.44 - 1090.84] in the end like I said like I said 10 15
[1089.24 - 1093.68] years ago and I think it was probably 15
[1090.84 - 1095.36] years ago now time's Flying Too Fast
[1093.68 - 1096.96] remember the doctors being like no keep
[1095.36 - 1098.36] that red meat down you got to watch that
[1096.96 - 1099.40] high blood pressure keep the red meat
[1098.36 - 1103.44] down it was
[1099.40 - 1107.32] brilliant brilliant absolutely brilliant
[1103.44 - 1110.32] but those days are gone that smartness
[1107.32 - 1110.32] smartness
[1111.28 - 1117.56] that that goodness and smartness was
[1114.76 - 1120.04] only there for a hot second and then
[1117.56 - 1123.52] it's gone now every single doctor on the
[1120.04 - 1126.24] planet's like no no no animal protein no
[1123.52 - 1128.28] sugar animal protein no
[1126.24 - 1129.60] sugar I'm not saying I have anything
[1128.28 - 1130.56] against animal protein I'm just saying
[1129.60 - 1131.76] if you're dealing with high blood
[1130.56 - 1133.08] pressure or something you might want to
[1131.76 - 1136.56] switch up your game for a little while
[1133.08 - 1140.04] in your life and not have to be so stuck
[1136.56 - 1142.72] into a belief system
[1140.04 - 1145.00] because belief systems will break you
[1142.72 - 1146.92] down not break you down they'll get you
[1145.00 - 1149.64] in the end because the belief system
[1146.92 - 1151.84] itself won't be looking out for you and
[1149.64 - 1154.36] you'll get cheated shorted and you'll
[1151.84 - 1158.28] get the the the bad end of this the
[1154.36 - 1161.40] whole bad end of it all because belief
[1158.28 - 1166.60] systems don't believe in
[1161.40 - 1168.84] you belief systems don't protect you and
[1166.60 - 1172.20] don't care about you in the end
[1168.84 - 1174.00] and belief systems just can't they just
[1172.20 - 1176.48] don't
[1174.00 - 1178.16] so so what happens how do we get that
[1176.48 - 1179.88] high blood pressure without having heart
[1178.16 - 1181.32] disease or cardiovascular disease or
[1179.88 - 1183.04] anything like that how do we get it the
[1181.32 - 1185.44] liver starts getting Mucky dirty
[1183.04 - 1187.60] sluggish doggish
[1185.44 - 1189.40] stagnant The Blood starts getting
[1187.60 - 1192.56] thicker and thicker and thicker and then
[1189.40 - 1196.60] the heart's working harder to pump blood
[1192.56 - 1199.32] through a straw thick milkshake blood
[1196.60 - 1200.96] through a straw
[1199.32 - 1202.96] and that's what happens and if you're
[1200.96 - 1203.80] vegetarian hey I don't eat red meat I'm
[1202.96 - 1206.96] a
[1203.80 - 1209.56] vegetarian and that look I that's cool
[1206.96 - 1212.12] you're vegetarian but if you're eating
[1209.56 - 1213.00] cheese clogging up that liver thickening
[1212.12 - 1215.60] up the
[1213.00 - 1217.92] blood and the heart has to pump through
[1215.60 - 1219.92] a straw like that that that thick
[1217.92 - 1223.28] milkshake through a straw versus water
[1219.92 - 1225.08] through a straw it has to pull blood
[1223.28 - 1228.36] through those
[1225.08 - 1232.48] veins thick heavy blood fill the cheese
[1228.36 - 1235.28] mucus mucus cheese Dairy
[1232.48 - 1239.40] butter the butter thing out of control
[1235.28 - 1242.24] is it Butter's good for us oh dear Lord
[1239.40 - 1245.24] oh my God Trend fat fads and
[1242.24 - 1247.64] Trends you got to laugh a little bit you
[1245.24 - 1249.32] can't get too upset about it all even
[1247.64 - 1252.68] though people's lives are always you
[1249.32 - 1254.60] know involved and at risk and you know
[1252.68 - 1256.16] people sufferings involved but you can't
[1254.60 - 1258.56] you can't you can't these Trends you
[1256.16 - 1260.36] can't let these Trends make you too
[1258.56 - 1264.48] crazy you have to kind of laugh about it
[1260.36 - 1265.84] a little bit the butter thing so so when
[1264.48 - 1267.56] you're thinking about putting butter in
[1265.84 - 1270.20] your in your drink in the morning in
[1267.56 - 1271.80] your hot drink in the morning or you're
[1270.20 - 1274.08] thinking about you know whatever
[1271.80 - 1275.48] thinking it's healthy just think again
[1274.08 - 1276.88] because your liver doesn't like it and
[1275.48 - 1278.04] your heart's not going to like it and if
[1276.88 - 1279.80] you're young and you don't have high
[1278.04 - 1281.76] blood pressure and you want to have
[1279.80 - 1283.60] butter and you want to live in the
[1281.76 - 1285.76] moment okay but you know what remember
[1283.60 - 1288.24] the show 20 years from
[1285.76 - 1289.48] now remember the show 20 years from now
[1288.24 - 1291.84] when you're
[1289.48 - 1295.96] 40 remember the show 20 years from now
[1291.84 - 1298.24] when you're 50 okay so here's the
[1295.96 - 1299.60] deal it's not just about cleaning up the
[1298.24 - 1301.24] liver or anything like that it's about
[1299.60 - 1303.56] getting the diet right so the heart
[1301.24 - 1304.96] doesn't have to pump so hard look if you
[1303.56 - 1306.28] don't have high blood pressure or if you
[1304.96 - 1308.60] don't have a blood pressure problem at
[1306.28 - 1311.36] all then don't even D just okay fine you
[1308.60 - 1313.16] don't have to worry just move on but you
[1311.36 - 1315.24] should listen to it and you should learn
[1313.16 - 1317.80] cuz it's important it is important so
[1315.24 - 1319.76] you can look out for a loved one or look
[1317.80 - 1323.44] out for yourself in the
[1319.76 - 1325.36] future so when that blood gets thick and
[1323.44 - 1327.64] pasty and
[1325.36 - 1330.80] dehydrated and the heart has to work
[1327.64 - 1334.88] harder it strains the heart it strains
[1330.80 - 1337.36] it and it causes veins to have such a
[1334.88 - 1340.68] suction to it that the veins they
[1337.36 - 1344.08] tighten up they tighten up they don't
[1340.68 - 1346.48] collapse in but they they
[1344.08 - 1350.24] constrict they constrict because of the
[1346.48 - 1352.36] suction the pole so the veins constrict
[1350.24 - 1354.92] makes it even more
[1352.36 - 1359.04] difficult and less oxygen even gets to
[1354.92 - 1363.12] the liver which in turn less oxygen gets
[1359.04 - 1365.72] to the heart gets to the
[1363.12 - 1366.68] heart something to be cons something to
[1365.72 - 1370.04] understand something to consider
[1366.68 - 1375.92] something to know the heart wants free
[1370.04 - 1378.60] and clear fresh clean blood
[1375.92 - 1382.40] hydrated the right water content
[1378.60 - 1387.96] content the right minerals the right
[1382.40 - 1391.00] nutrients it wants blood that's like a
[1387.96 - 1393.32] waterfall in the Amazon that you would
[1391.00 - 1396.80] that you would dream of you know you
[1393.32 - 1398.28] would dream of of being in that water
[1396.80 - 1400.24] while the water's coming down even
[1398.28 - 1402.60] though there's serpents in that water
[1400.24 - 1404.76] like some dangerous snakes down there
[1402.60 - 1408.16] and out there in the Amazon like the
[1404.76 - 1409.44] fertil an snake the fertil an thing F
[1408.16 - 1412.72] you you're
[1409.44 - 1414.28] dead man you just you know people they
[1412.72 - 1416.28] go on these trips and they go into the
[1414.28 - 1418.68] Amazon and they go to South America or
[1416.28 - 1422.16] they go in other places around the world
[1418.68 - 1424.44] and and you know in different different
[1422.16 - 1426.16] different areas of the world and they
[1424.44 - 1427.80] want to be playing in that nice little
[1426.16 - 1429.80] swimming hole with that water coming
[1427.80 - 1432.68] down and all those Vines going around
[1429.80 - 1434.08] you get bit by a ferti an snake man it
[1432.68 - 1437.44] happens all the
[1434.08 - 1438.84] time yeah I know I'm a downer I'm a
[1437.44 - 1441.32] downer
[1438.84 - 1444.32] but I'm all about looking out for you
[1441.32 - 1446.16] I'm all about looking out for you okay
[1444.32 - 1447.48] so the heart wants us clean blood
[1446.16 - 1449.04] because it has to work harder when it
[1447.48 - 1450.64] works harder you get a elevated blood
[1449.04 - 1452.60] pressure doctor looks at you there's no
[1450.64 - 1454.52] cardiovascular disease diagnoses you
[1452.60 - 1456.56] with hypertension so you get diagnosed
[1454.52 - 1458.76] as you know
[1456.56 - 1460.04] hypertension if you ask the doctor why
[1458.76 - 1461.48] is it the doctor says well I don't know
[1460.04 - 1463.00] your diet's not so bad I don't see any
[1461.48 - 1464.56] cardiovascular problems maybe you just
[1463.00 - 1466.20] need to exercise get your diet a little
[1464.56 - 1468.44] bit better maybe do a little bit more
[1466.20 - 1470.40] high protein which is wrong
[1468.44 - 1472.44] but maybe do a little high protein knock
[1470.40 - 1475.16] out the sugar well yeah knock out the
[1472.44 - 1477.80] sugar is right not the fruit not the
[1475.16 - 1481.00] sweet potatoes not the yams not the
[1477.80 - 1483.04] winter squash not the regular potatoes
[1481.00 - 1487.44] you don't knock any of that out that's
[1483.04 - 1491.40] just blatant stupidity in the world of
[1487.44 - 1493.64] Trends right now trendy junk science
[1491.40 - 1496.32] trendy junk science someone said to me
[1493.64 - 1498.28] and said wait a minute here your books
[1496.32 - 1500.24] are filled with science
[1498.28 - 1502.04] I said ' huh and somebody said your
[1500.24 - 1504.24] books are filled with science all your
[1502.04 - 1507.60] books it's just it's all
[1504.24 - 1510.32] science I go it's all from Spirit it's
[1507.60 - 1512.36] undiscovered science and they go okay
[1510.32 - 1515.28] wait a minute but it's not it's not like
[1512.36 - 1517.72] peer-reviewed science I go why would I
[1515.28 - 1519.40] want that that's junk science I don't
[1517.72 - 1521.36] want my books filled with junk science
[1519.40 - 1522.92] no one would have gotten better or maybe
[1521.36 - 1525.72] a handful got better and then I would
[1522.92 - 1528.32] have to heral Herald them as as the the
[1525.72 - 1529.64] poster the poster people
[1528.32 - 1530.88] because you know what it's there's a
[1529.64 - 1533.12] difference when you get tens of
[1530.88 - 1535.56] thousands of people better and healed
[1533.12 - 1538.24] and better from your books than just
[1535.56 - 1540.80] getting a few and then trying to exalt
[1538.24 - 1543.24] that and and use that as your poster
[1540.80 - 1544.92] board I said you know yeah no it's not
[1543.24 - 1546.60] fill the junk I don't want junk science
[1544.92 - 1549.68] in there it's from
[1546.60 - 1551.88] Spirit yeah there's a big difference big
[1549.68 - 1553.64] difference so what happens is when
[1551.88 - 1556.56] you're told that you need more high
[1553.64 - 1558.48] protein and to avoid fruit and avoid
[1556.56 - 1561.16] fruit and sweet potato Poes and avoid
[1558.48 - 1563.32] yams and avoid regular potatoes and
[1561.16 - 1566.32] avoid other things like this and avoid
[1563.32 - 1567.52] raw honey when you're told to avoid all
[1566.32 - 1570.20] those
[1567.52 - 1572.24] things because of junk science it is
[1570.20 - 1574.76] junk science you see how it works I mean
[1572.24 - 1577.28] because you're not supposed to avoid
[1574.76 - 1578.76] apples you're not supposed to avoid all
[1577.28 - 1581.04] the different good fruits you're not
[1578.76 - 1582.84] supposed to avoid bananas no you're not
[1581.04 - 1585.16] it's the greatest food to keep your
[1582.84 - 1586.56] blood clean it's the greatest food for
[1585.16 - 1588.12] the heart guess what your heart is do
[1586.56 - 1591.52] you know what your heart is
[1588.12 - 1594.84] your heart is a muscle it's a muscle
[1591.52 - 1597.04] guess what a muscle needs a carbohydrate
[1594.84 - 1601.52] you know what happens if we starve a
[1597.04 - 1603.64] muscle of sugar it dies it atrophies if
[1601.52 - 1605.76] you starve a muscle of sugar it
[1603.64 - 1608.36] atrophies did you know I have seen
[1605.76 - 1610.96] people over the years go on a no sugar
[1608.36 - 1612.48] diet completely no sugar at all nothing
[1610.96 - 1614.48] at all no sugar at all these were a lot
[1612.48 - 1616.96] of bad trendy diets that were no sugar
[1614.48 - 1618.36] at all not even a berry put in there not
[1616.96 - 1620.36] even an apple Apple put in there not
[1618.36 - 1623.12] even a green apple did you know their
[1620.36 - 1625.32] hearts atrophied because they're on
[1623.12 - 1627.64] animal protein only and a few assorted
[1625.32 - 1629.56] vegetables and they didn't get enough
[1627.64 - 1632.64] carbohydrate to their heart and their
[1629.56 - 1636.36] brain their heart though being a muscle
[1632.64 - 1638.28] atrophied so they atrophied their hearts
[1636.36 - 1642.24] they atrophied their hearts on the
[1638.28 - 1644.60] trendy trendy high protein no sugar diet
[1642.24 - 1647.64] their hearts atrophied because their
[1644.60 - 1649.88] hearts are a muscle and they require a
[1647.64 - 1651.96] lot of carbohydrate a tremendous amount
[1649.88 - 1654.68] of carbohydrate in
[1651.96 - 1657.64] Sugar you take a carbohydrate away from
[1654.68 - 1659.80] a marathon runner put a marathon runner
[1657.64 - 1663.56] on high protein in a few vegetables and
[1659.80 - 1665.04] never give them one single gram of sugar
[1663.56 - 1666.72] put a put a marathon runner on that
[1665.04 - 1669.64] we'll see how good his game goes or her
[1666.72 - 1671.84] game goes be a
[1669.64 - 1673.76] disaster but what happens is protein
[1671.84 - 1675.44] bars are filled with sugar no one
[1673.76 - 1676.68] realizes that they're filled with sugar
[1675.44 - 1678.16] so when you're eating protein bars
[1676.68 - 1679.88] you're getting sugar so at least you can
[1678.16 - 1682.28] run your Marathon because you got sugar
[1679.88 - 1684.88] going in you even if you're told to stay
[1682.28 - 1687.72] off of all sugar it's just
[1684.88 - 1690.32] bizarre your heart has to have a
[1687.72 - 1692.52] carbohydrate every cell in the heart a
[1690.32 - 1695.88] sugar has to enter it in order to keep
[1692.52 - 1695.88] it alive thriving and non-
[1696.04 - 1701.20] atrophying you have to remember that
[1699.36 - 1703.16] that's how critical it is your liers
[1701.20 - 1705.12] filled the glucose it stores the
[1703.16 - 1707.72] glycogen to keep you safe and keep your
[1705.12 - 1709.40] adrenal safe if you don't eat the right
[1707.72 - 1712.96] fruits and the right sweet potatoes and
[1709.40 - 1715.92] if you want to be a raw dude if you want
[1712.96 - 1717.84] to be a raw dude then you just do all
[1715.92 - 1719.76] raw fruits raw fruits and lots of leafy
[1717.84 - 1721.12] greens and vegetables and the whole bit
[1719.76 - 1722.24] and you can do some nuts and seeds and
[1721.12 - 1723.16] you can do things like that and all of
[1722.24 - 1725.08] it you got to be careful you don't
[1723.16 - 1726.80] overdo the nuts and seeds you want to be
[1725.08 - 1727.92] vegetarian you got to do lots of fruits
[1726.80 - 1730.48] you know I tell
[1727.92 - 1732.00] vegetarians I tell vegetarians why don't
[1730.48 - 1732.84] you you're already there why don't you
[1732.00 - 1734.88] go
[1732.84 - 1736.60] plant-based and and you know when I tell
[1734.88 - 1738.28] animal I tell paleo people and high
[1736.60 - 1739.88] animal protein people people there I say
[1738.28 - 1741.60] look you're already now bringing in a
[1739.88 - 1743.24] green juice for the first time you
[1741.60 - 1745.40] because of because the trendy diet is
[1743.24 - 1748.04] Shifting now because they the trendy
[1745.40 - 1750.92] diets right now are stealing from the
[1748.04 - 1753.36] alternative model it's hilarious to see
[1750.92 - 1755.96] it from standing away from it you guys
[1753.36 - 1757.44] might not see it because it you know I I
[1755.96 - 1759.28] could stand away from it and see it
[1757.44 - 1760.84] because I don't hold the belief system
[1759.28 - 1763.04] and a lot of people they hold the belief
[1760.84 - 1764.92] system and what happens is the belief
[1763.04 - 1767.76] system blinds them so they can't stand
[1764.92 - 1770.24] away from it I can stand away and see
[1767.76 - 1772.44] that the conventional movement in the
[1770.24 - 1774.72] diet world all the experts now they
[1772.44 - 1777.04] robbed and theft it and
[1774.72 - 1778.88] stole alternative things that were
[1777.04 - 1780.36] critical to Healing people so
[1778.88 - 1781.68] alternative movement healed a lot of
[1780.36 - 1782.88] people over the years too I mean there's
[1781.68 - 1784.88] a lot of people that healed a lot of
[1782.88 - 1787.24] great alternative stuff and one of the
[1784.88 - 1790.40] reasons why what healed them was a lot
[1787.24 - 1792.00] of the juicing a lot of the vegetables a
[1790.40 - 1793.56] lot of leafy greens and fruits and stuff
[1792.00 - 1795.04] like that and that you know a lot of the
[1793.56 - 1797.36] plant-based
[1795.04 - 1799.68] movement that did a lot for people
[1797.36 - 1801.40] people so what happened was the animal
[1799.68 - 1803.16] protein people in The Last 5 Years the
[1801.40 - 1805.40] experts putting out their books now they
[1803.16 - 1807.68] they're robbing and thefting those green
[1805.40 - 1810.12] juices they're incorporating them into
[1807.68 - 1811.36] their their trendy high-fat diets and
[1810.12 - 1813.48] they're noticing people are getting a
[1811.36 - 1815.20] little bit better so what I tell is that
[1813.48 - 1817.80] you know I tell the Paleo crowd the high
[1815.20 - 1820.56] protein crowd you're already there you
[1817.80 - 1823.04] got now the green juice in there Bravo
[1820.56 - 1825.48] you got the green juice in there now and
[1823.04 - 1826.92] you got more leafy greens in there now
[1825.48 - 1828.44] just lower the animal protein a little
[1826.92 - 1829.92] bit more for your liver and your heart
[1828.44 - 1831.12] you can still keep your animal proteins
[1829.92 - 1832.80] in there if you really want but just
[1831.12 - 1834.52] lower them down a little bit and I tell
[1832.80 - 1837.08] the vegetarians look you're already
[1834.52 - 1839.04] there get rid of the cheese you're
[1837.08 - 1841.12] already you're almost plant-based get
[1839.04 - 1843.36] rid of the cheese you don't eat red meat
[1841.12 - 1845.64] get rid of the cheese and get rid of the
[1843.36 - 1847.40] eggs and they're like I don't know
[1845.64 - 1849.60] they're like no you know Mr William I
[1847.40 - 1851.68] don't know I I don't know if I could do
[1849.60 - 1852.96] that I go what do you mean you're all
[1851.68 - 1855.08] you're already
[1852.96 - 1856.56] there why are you going to Gunk Gunk up
[1855.08 - 1859.44] your liver and Gunk up your heart with
[1856.56 - 1862.44] all that cheese and all that milk and
[1859.44 - 1864.20] all those eggs you're already there you
[1862.44 - 1865.72] should be going plant-based if that's
[1864.20 - 1867.32] where you want to go and the high
[1865.72 - 1868.64] protein people look you're already there
[1867.32 - 1870.56] the high protein paleo people you
[1868.64 - 1871.96] already got in you're already getting in
[1870.56 - 1873.92] the juices you're already getting in
[1871.96 - 1876.36] more leafy greens and and and more
[1873.92 - 1878.60] berries and more berries in a green
[1876.36 - 1880.12] apple why don't you bring in a little
[1878.60 - 1881.92] bit more of that and just lower your
[1880.12 - 1883.76] animal protein a little bit do it once a
[1881.92 - 1886.04] day so you can save your liver and your
[1883.76 - 1887.64] heart when you step back and you don't
[1886.04 - 1889.08] have a belief system you know what you
[1887.64 - 1890.76] can do for people and you know what's
[1889.08 - 1893.20] right because you know when you don't
[1890.76 - 1895.64] have that belief system you can you can
[1893.20 - 1898.44] navigate you can
[1895.64 - 1900.60] navigate and that's the gift Spirit gave
[1898.44 - 1902.20] me you know Spirit told me when I was
[1900.60 - 1904.04] younger Spirit was like you're going to
[1902.20 - 1905.48] be able to navigate I'm going to give
[1904.04 - 1906.40] you the information you're going to be
[1905.48 - 1910.60] able to
[1906.40 - 1913.60] navigate and I love that so all right so
[1910.60 - 1915.64] here's the deal the heart's a muscle it
[1913.60 - 1920.08] needs a carbohydrate you got to be
[1915.64 - 1921.80] cautious you can't high fat your blood
[1920.08 - 1923.92] with so much fat that means if you're
[1921.80 - 1926.88] plant-based you can't be doing nutcakes
[1923.92 - 1930.20] and nut pies 247 you got to be doing
[1926.88 - 1932.16] lots of fruit plant-based and lots of
[1930.20 - 1933.76] leafy greens when you're plant-based you
[1932.16 - 1935.20] could still have some hem seeds and some
[1933.76 - 1936.80] walnuts and you can still do what you
[1935.20 - 1938.92] want to do there you have some avocado
[1936.80 - 1940.92] of course you can but you got to keep
[1938.92 - 1943.04] your fats low like I said with the VAR
[1940.92 - 1945.16] vegetarians just get rid of the eggs and
[1943.04 - 1947.44] dairy like I said with the high high
[1945.16 - 1948.96] protein people limit it to one protein
[1947.44 - 1951.04] or something and go every other day with
[1948.96 - 1954.20] an animal protein in this way you can
[1951.04 - 1957.12] get your blood less fatty your heart
[1954.20 - 1959.36] works less hard your liver works less
[1957.12 - 1962.64] hard your blood gets cleaner it gets
[1959.36 - 1965.48] more hydrated it gets a better quality
[1962.64 - 1967.56] of blood going in there oxygen rises in
[1965.48 - 1969.28] the blood when the blood's rushing to
[1967.56 - 1972.44] the liver through the hepatic portal
[1969.28 - 1974.52] vein it's alive it's got less poisons
[1972.44 - 1978.16] and toxins in it it's got more water
[1974.52 - 1980.24] molecules and it has more of everything
[1978.16 - 1982.60] oxygen included it goes to the liver the
[1980.24 - 1985.04] liver starts to heal the heart works
[1982.60 - 1986.72] less and all the fruits you're adding
[1985.04 - 1988.20] into your diet and the sweet potatoes
[1986.72 - 1989.88] and the winter squash and even the
[1988.20 - 1991.68] regular potatoes you're adding into your
[1989.88 - 1993.60] diet with your leafy greens and
[1991.68 - 1995.84] everything else you're doing gets your
[1993.60 - 1998.36] heart to get that precious glycogen
[1995.84 - 2000.68] storage the glucose I mean glucose into
[1998.36 - 2003.08] the cells of the heart the liver has the
[2000.68 - 2005.56] glycogen storage the heart gets cells
[2003.08 - 2008.28] gets sugar right directly into every
[2005.56 - 2010.72] cell and the Heart Won't atrophy and it
[2008.28 - 2014.00] stays strong so when it has to work hard
[2010.72 - 2016.04] and pump thick nasty blood it doesn't
[2014.00 - 2019.16] weaken it stays strong too that's
[2016.04 - 2020.80] another thing and then you start you
[2019.16 - 2022.32] you'll see the blood pressure go down
[2020.80 - 2024.28] the doctor be like I don't know why your
[2022.32 - 2026.12] blood your blood pressure went down
[2024.28 - 2027.64] let's take you off the medication well
[2026.12 - 2031.00] you you need less blood pressure
[2027.64 - 2032.44] medication and less or don't even use
[2031.00 - 2033.60] the blood pressure medication let's just
[2032.44 - 2035.16] see where we're going it's getting
[2033.60 - 2037.68] better and better and
[2035.16 - 2041.12] better what's going on Mr Jones are you
[2037.68 - 2043.80] exercising and and eating more red meat
[2041.12 - 2045.28] no what I'm doing is cleaning up my
[2043.80 - 2047.68] blood getting my liver a little better
[2045.28 - 2049.96] and giving my heart a
[2047.68 - 2051.72] break and you get better and that's the
[2049.96 - 2053.92] mystery of high blood
[2051.72 - 2056.04] pressure that's the mystery high blood
[2053.92 - 2057.64] pressure celery juice is a miracle for
[2056.04 - 2059.36] blood pressure I know that there's a lot
[2057.64 - 2060.92] of people that are worried about ah my
[2059.36 - 2062.36] blood pressure is too low I can't drink
[2060.92 - 2065.28] celery juice my blood pressure is too
[2062.36 - 2068.68] low can't drink it I can't drink it not
[2065.28 - 2073.12] true Did You Know that celery juice
[2068.68 - 2075.76] balances blood pressure balances no one
[2073.12 - 2079.28] knows this once again because of trendy
[2075.76 - 2082.36] Miss information or recycled theories
[2079.28 - 2085.08] going around out there no one has it
[2082.36 - 2087.00] right is why I read the that's why I
[2085.08 - 2088.76] read the beginning of the show like I do
[2087.00 - 2090.00] and I say what I do I probably drives
[2088.76 - 2092.96] you crazy when I do that in front of
[2090.00 - 2095.36] every show there's a reason cuz no one
[2092.96 - 2097.68] has it right it's
[2095.36 - 2102.32] painful it's pain
[2097.68 - 2106.28] painful to see it celery juice is a
[2102.32 - 2109.12] blood stabilizer balancer it's
[2106.28 - 2111.56] adaptogenic for the body what happens is
[2109.12 - 2115.04] if your blood pressure is low celery
[2111.56 - 2120.04] juice can raise it if your blood
[2115.04 - 2124.08] pressure is high celery juice can lower
[2120.04 - 2125.44] it see just just just walk this walk
[2124.08 - 2126.56] through this with me I know because a
[2125.44 - 2128.84] lot of people who have low blood
[2126.56 - 2131.00] pressure they're they're totally
[2128.84 - 2133.48] paranoid about the
[2131.00 - 2135.20] celery and then you know what they'll go
[2133.48 - 2137.52] and eat something
[2135.20 - 2141.28] ridiculous they'll eat
[2137.52 - 2143.88] eggs me they'll eat eggs I see it all
[2141.28 - 2146.16] the time I mean I even see it on social
[2143.88 - 2148.04] media I see it all the time out there
[2146.16 - 2150.84] it's like no no I can't do celery juice
[2148.04 - 2153.63] I got low BL low blood pressure and they
[2150.84 - 2155.80] got they eat two eggs that
[2153.63 - 2158.80] [Laughter]
[2155.80 - 2158.80] day
[2158.84 - 2164.24] seriously all right so anyway so I got
[2162.16 - 2167.08] to walk through it with you again the
[2164.24 - 2172.16] celery juice raises blood pressure when
[2167.08 - 2174.48] it's low it it St it's a
[2172.16 - 2176.08] stabilizer because what happens with low
[2174.48 - 2177.72] blood pressure people they have a
[2176.08 - 2179.72] different problem with their liver they
[2177.72 - 2182.16] have a whole entire different problem if
[2179.72 - 2184.16] they don't have a leak somewhere if they
[2182.16 - 2186.28] don't have a valve leak if they don't
[2184.16 - 2188.64] have a ventricle leak if they don't have
[2186.28 - 2189.80] something like that going on and a
[2188.64 - 2190.84] doctor I mean we're talking about low
[2189.80 - 2192.80] blood pressure I'm talking about low
[2190.84 - 2195.48] blood pressure and a doctor that ran
[2192.80 - 2198.64] every test in the book can't find a
[2195.48 - 2200.44] physical physical aspect to why they
[2198.64 - 2201.92] have low blood pressure so they have to
[2200.44 - 2204.84] come up with all these autoimmune
[2201.92 - 2206.60] theories or the body's just confused or
[2204.84 - 2208.40] you're it's genetic you know maybe
[2206.60 - 2209.68] somebody in your ancestry had low blood
[2208.40 - 2211.60] pressure they have to come up with all
[2209.68 - 2213.40] that crap that junk science feeds
[2211.60 - 2217.64] doctors so doctors have some kind of
[2213.40 - 2221.04] answer and so all that
[2217.64 - 2223.72] involved all that
[2221.04 - 2225.84] involved and then you know what happens
[2223.72 - 2227.80] there massive confusion and so when
[2225.84 - 2229.16] someone someone has this kind of low
[2227.80 - 2230.76] blood pressure they don't know where to
[2229.16 - 2233.12] go what is it what really does this
[2230.76 - 2234.76] what's happening what they have going on
[2233.12 - 2237.48] is a whole different problem they got a
[2234.76 - 2240.76] viral issue that's a viral issue low
[2237.48 - 2243.12] blood pressure people have a viral issue
[2240.76 - 2244.76] that's what they do and they have a
[2243.12 - 2246.24] little bit of an adrenal dysfunction
[2244.76 - 2248.04] along with it even if they don't have
[2246.24 - 2250.24] the fat fatigue they have a little bit
[2248.04 - 2253.08] of an adrenal
[2250.24 - 2255.24] function issue and they're they're and
[2253.08 - 2258.56] they have a viral issue too that's what
[2255.24 - 2259.80] low blood pressure people have and it's
[2258.56 - 2263.24] a
[2259.80 - 2264.60] virus and that that's what happens there
[2263.24 - 2266.20] so this is what happens when you have a
[2264.60 - 2268.64] low-grade virus a lot of people have
[2266.20 - 2270.16] different varieties of lowgrade viruses
[2268.64 - 2272.44] and there's nothing wrong with that
[2270.16 - 2274.96] perfectly fine perfectly fine there's
[2272.44 - 2277.44] nothing wrong with that but a few things
[2274.96 - 2279.08] occur as the virus releases certain
[2277.44 - 2281.56] types of poisons and certain types of
[2279.08 - 2283.44] poisons are recognized by the
[2281.56 - 2286.56] body the
[2283.44 - 2288.56] heart does something a little different
[2286.56 - 2291.52] because the heart doesn't want to be
[2288.56 - 2294.48] pumping lots and lots of poison really
[2291.52 - 2296.48] hard and fast throughout the body so the
[2294.48 - 2299.16] brain gets saturated with
[2296.48 - 2300.56] it so the body's communicating with self
[2299.16 - 2301.92] the brain's communicating with the heart
[2300.56 - 2303.60] the liver's communicating with the heart
[2301.92 - 2305.12] the brain's communicating with the liver
[2303.60 - 2307.00] they're all communicating together and
[2305.12 - 2309.16] even the thyroids communicating with all
[2307.00 - 2311.88] that so with all that together
[2309.16 - 2315.12] communicating low blood pressure occurs
[2311.88 - 2318.28] because of a toxic load a toxic load
[2315.12 - 2320.04] that the body's being systematically
[2318.28 - 2323.20] cautious
[2320.04 - 2324.80] about that means that if the if if if
[2323.20 - 2327.00] the heart for instance somebody with low
[2324.80 - 2329.12] blood pressure if they exercise the
[2327.00 - 2330.96] people with low blood pressure usually
[2329.12 - 2333.20] have other symptoms develop or they had
[2330.96 - 2334.56] symptoms before their low blood blood
[2333.20 - 2336.52] low blood pressure and they're dealing
[2334.56 - 2340.20] with lowgrade problems low grade
[2336.52 - 2341.72] symptoms fatigue a little bit of fatigue
[2340.20 - 2343.44] they're dealing with things where they
[2341.72 - 2345.24] they if they exercise they're they're
[2343.44 - 2347.48] like wasted for a few days they don't
[2345.24 - 2349.04] feel good all these kinds of different
[2347.48 - 2350.60] things happen with people at low blood
[2349.04 - 2352.00] pressure then they get diagnosed with
[2350.60 - 2355.60] all these different things they can get
[2352.00 - 2357.32] diagnosed with dis with dis aonia dis
[2355.60 - 2359.00] aonia you and that's a whole thing that
[2357.32 - 2360.28] can happen too they can get diagnosed
[2359.00 - 2362.72] with different varieties of that you
[2360.28 - 2364.64] know pots whatever they can get they the
[2362.72 - 2368.08] whole thing with blood pressure but it's
[2364.64 - 2369.88] viral it's 100% viral and sometimes
[2368.08 - 2371.96] adrenals get underactive because of the
[2369.88 - 2374.08] viral issue sometimes the virus is
[2371.96 - 2376.04] sitting in the liver that's usually
[2374.08 - 2379.80] where it sits it doesn't mean the liver
[2376.04 - 2382.68] is so clogged or so toxic where the
[2379.80 - 2384.64] heart has to work harder it's just that
[2382.68 - 2387.48] there's communication within the body
[2384.64 - 2389.08] the brain the heart liver thyroid the
[2387.48 - 2391.32] adrenals just communication going on
[2389.08 - 2393.16] through the whole body and is the
[2391.32 - 2394.48] low-grade virus you get the low this is
[2393.16 - 2396.16] the same thing with people that get real
[2394.48 - 2397.08] low temperatures they got a low grade
[2396.16 - 2398.64] virus
[2397.08 - 2400.20] so you gets people that are like oh my
[2398.64 - 2405.44] God I'm actually
[2400.20 - 2409.48] 95.9 de I'm not 86 I am not
[2405.44 - 2409.92] 88.6 88.6 I'm not 98.6 sorry about that
[2409.48 - 2411.68] you
[2409.92 - 2417.20] [Laughter]
[2411.68 - 2419.20] guys I'm not 98.6 degrees I'm
[2417.20 - 2422.28] 96.4
[2419.20 - 2424.00] degrees how is that possible that's what
[2422.28 - 2425.32] people that people they all freak out
[2424.00 - 2426.72] when they get their when they finally
[2425.32 - 2427.92] take their temperatures or they the
[2426.72 - 2429.20] doctor takes their temperature and the
[2427.92 - 2434.00] doctor's like doctor's office like
[2429.20 - 2436.04] you're 96.7 de you're supposed to be
[2434.00 - 2437.32] 98.6 first of all not everybody's
[2436.04 - 2440.12] supposed to be
[2437.32 - 2442.56] 98.6 a lot of people are supposed to be
[2440.12 - 2444.92] 97 in the 97s I'm just telling you right
[2442.56 - 2446.76] now but there's people that they're
[2444.92 - 2449.64] literally in the
[2446.76 - 2452.52] 96s and because of that that's a low
[2449.64 - 2455.00] that's a low grade viral infection
[2452.52 - 2456.68] there's no fever but that's a low- grade
[2455.00 - 2459.20] viral infection that's what that that is
[2456.68 - 2460.68] inside the liver and inside the body
[2459.20 - 2462.40] it's the same thing with the low blood
[2460.68 - 2465.12] pressure the mystery low blood pressure
[2462.40 - 2466.84] I'm not talking about an actual real
[2465.12 - 2468.96] physical condition discovered by the
[2466.84 - 2471.44] doctors talking about mystery low blood
[2468.96 - 2473.60] pressure there there's a low-grade virus
[2471.44 - 2475.32] causing that too it's very similar most
[2473.60 - 2476.92] people with the mystery low blood
[2475.32 - 2478.00] pressure have a very low temperature
[2476.92 - 2481.48] especially in the
[2478.00 - 2483.52] morning in the morning and even at night
[2481.48 - 2485.04] even at night too or in the middle of
[2483.52 - 2486.44] the day you can do I've seen it in the
[2485.04 - 2488.04] middle of the day people's temperatures
[2486.44 - 2489.52] drop seen it in the morning right when
[2488.04 - 2490.96] they get up their temperature drop
[2489.52 - 2492.84] seeing it even at the end of the day or
[2490.96 - 2494.80] the evening which usually is when it
[2492.84 - 2496.56] goes up for the most part but it's
[2494.80 - 2499.16] usually I guess morning and and
[2496.56 - 2501.32] afternoon and there's a lowgrade viral
[2499.16 - 2502.96] thing going on in the system and there's
[2501.32 - 2505.88] a communication going on with the whole
[2502.96 - 2508.64] body because what happens is if if that
[2505.88 - 2510.80] if that Blood starts rushing with
[2508.64 - 2513.36] because the body's on alert it's on
[2510.80 - 2515.24] alert if the blood starts rushing it you
[2513.36 - 2517.04] know it the body's concerned about
[2515.24 - 2518.40] poisons and toxins going into certain
[2517.04 - 2520.00] places like the brain the liver is
[2518.40 - 2522.96] concerned it's going to go to the BL
[2520.00 - 2524.76] brain organs have communicate first of
[2522.96 - 2525.92] all have to know this organs communicate
[2524.76 - 2527.60] they communicate with each other and
[2525.92 - 2529.44] they have high intelligence level
[2527.60 - 2530.92] extremely high intelligence level
[2529.44 - 2532.60] intelligence we can't even think about
[2530.92 - 2534.44] or understand or know about science of
[2532.60 - 2535.68] research has no idea how the liver
[2534.44 - 2537.56] communicates with the brain how the
[2535.68 - 2539.72] brain communicates with the liver how it
[2537.56 - 2541.32] works how the heart communicates there's
[2539.72 - 2542.92] communication going on all the time it's
[2541.32 - 2544.64] not just the brain's giving orders
[2542.92 - 2546.64] through nerves and making nerve function
[2544.64 - 2548.32] happen and making organs do with their
[2546.64 - 2549.88] that's not it at all it's way more than
[2548.32 - 2551.72] that if we think it's not more than that
[2549.88 - 2554.48] then we're just ridiculous because it's
[2551.72 - 2556.16] way more than that we're in just Deni if
[2554.48 - 2558.36] we don't if we don't know
[2556.16 - 2560.48] that and so that's another that's
[2558.36 - 2562.28] another thing that happens plus you can
[2560.48 - 2564.20] have somebody with different kinds of um
[2562.28 - 2565.36] low-grade viral issues and they'll have
[2564.20 - 2567.48] their adrenals will be really
[2565.36 - 2570.00] underactive they'll have underactive
[2567.48 - 2572.08] adrenals that that itself will cause low
[2570.00 - 2575.20] blood pressure underactive
[2572.08 - 2577.28] adrenals that itself so when you have
[2575.20 - 2578.88] underactive adrenals you have a viral
[2577.28 - 2580.60] situation in the body you can you can
[2578.88 - 2583.44] get the low blood
[2580.60 - 2584.72] pressure so that that all that that's
[2583.44 - 2585.76] these are just some of the reasons for
[2584.72 - 2588.60] low blood
[2585.76 - 2590.24] pressure also there's a lot of people
[2588.60 - 2592.64] that are supposed to have lower blood
[2590.24 - 2594.04] pressure there's there's a lot of people
[2592.64 - 2596.76] out there that are supposed to have
[2594.04 - 2598.48] lower low not super low not super low
[2596.76 - 2600.04] but they're supposed to be their blood
[2598.48 - 2602.48] pressure is supposed to be
[2600.04 - 2604.64] lower it's who they are it's just it's
[2602.48 - 2607.20] it's natural and guess what it's not a
[2604.64 - 2610.08] bad thing it's just when you go past the
[2607.20 - 2612.52] limitations of low and you're in another
[2610.08 - 2614.36] another level of low that's when there's
[2612.52 - 2616.80] this low-grade viral infection you can
[2614.36 - 2618.40] be in a normal low blood pressure where
[2616.80 - 2620.84] it's actually healthy and good and and
[2618.40 - 2623.36] and but yet a little extra
[2620.84 - 2625.76] low and and there's nothing wrong with
[2623.36 - 2628.52] that also another thing to understand
[2625.76 - 2632.08] someone with low blood pressure in the
[2628.52 - 2634.64] super low Zone With lowgrade viral stuff
[2632.08 - 2636.64] it doesn't hurt the heart it doesn't
[2634.64 - 2639.28] hurt the heart
[2636.64 - 2641.52] and and and really it honestly when you
[2639.28 - 2642.88] work on cleaning up the viral stuff and
[2641.52 - 2644.68] you work on cleaning up the liver and
[2642.88 - 2646.60] you work on cleaning up your body and
[2644.68 - 2649.08] healing you
[2646.60 - 2650.68] know people with low low low low blood
[2649.08 - 2652.32] PR blood pressure have the Epstein bar
[2650.68 - 2654.80] virus they have the Epstein bar virus
[2652.32 - 2657.00] but they have they it's a certain
[2654.80 - 2659.48] variety of Epstein
[2657.00 - 2661.44] bar and so that's that's a big part of
[2659.48 - 2663.12] that but once you heal and move forward
[2661.44 - 2664.52] that that that blood pressure will come
[2663.12 - 2666.08] up and it'll come up and you'll get it a
[2664.52 - 2667.20] little better and a little better a
[2666.08 - 2668.92] little better you can't be afraid of
[2667.20 - 2671.60] celery juice CU you got low blood
[2668.92 - 2672.52] pressure low celery juice will help lift
[2671.60 - 2676.00] it
[2672.52 - 2677.64] up will help lift it up so that's just a
[2676.00 - 2680.12] massive confusion right there so what do
[2677.64 - 2681.52] we do let's just go with the m first of
[2680.12 - 2683.76] all let's talk about the we'll talk
[2681.52 - 2685.84] about the mystery the mystery high blood
[2683.76 - 2688.12] pressure got to lower your fats and you
[2685.84 - 2690.12] got to ease the burden off your liver so
[2688.12 - 2692.44] that's one thing got to lower your fats
[2690.12 - 2694.48] and ease the burden off your liver so
[2692.44 - 2696.48] that's really important it's stopping
[2694.48 - 2699.00] your blood from being so thick not
[2696.48 - 2701.92] letting your blood get so thick and and
[2699.00 - 2703.28] dirty and that's what you have to do so
[2701.92 - 2705.88] you already know the diet whole thing
[2703.28 - 2707.12] with the diet with you know with a diet
[2705.88 - 2709.28] with the uh if you want to be animal
[2707.12 - 2710.88] protein you got to bring it down to one
[2709.28 - 2712.88] you know one serving a day or every
[2710.88 - 2714.72] other day you can still be an animal
[2712.88 - 2716.44] protein person just bring in more of all
[2714.72 - 2718.12] the other things I talked about more of
[2716.44 - 2719.76] the fruits the vegetables can't be
[2718.12 - 2722.00] afraid of all the different fruits
[2719.76 - 2724.16] they're all there for a reason don't
[2722.00 - 2726.04] walk past the fruit section because
[2724.16 - 2729.20] you're being told somewhere that it's
[2726.04 - 2730.96] not it's not good for you you can you
[2729.20 - 2733.92] can eat some oranges there's no reason
[2730.96 - 2736.24] why you can't get an orange I mean it's
[2733.92 - 2738.88] longevity food that's what it is you're
[2736.24 - 2740.96] passing the longevity section of the
[2738.88 - 2743.60] market when you go past the produce
[2740.96 - 2745.88] aisle you're P meaning you're passing
[2743.60 - 2748.44] the fruit section then that means you're
[2745.88 - 2751.16] passing the longevity section that's
[2748.44 - 2755.32] that's literally a decision you're
[2751.16 - 2758.12] making because of trendy Mis you know

[2828.72 - 2833.00] that having that avocado in that salad

[2842.04 - 2846.40] healthy I I've never seen anything so
[2844.04 - 2849.36] demented in my life because it's not
[2846.40 - 2851.80] it's not don't get fooled by that unless
[2849.36 - 2853.60] it's the only food you got yes there's
[2851.80 - 2855.48] some nutrients and eggs yeah there's
[2853.60 - 2857.84] some vitamins and eggs yeah there's
[2855.48 - 2862.16] there's in some eggs there's an omega-3
[2857.84 - 2865.60] in there yeah in the healthier eggs of
[2862.16 - 2868.00] course but that's nothing that's nothing
[2865.60 - 2870.08] compared to what an avocado has and it's
[2868.00 - 2873.12] nothing compared to juicing celery juice
[2870.08 - 2875.32] has nothing compared to sweet potatoes
[2873.12 - 2877.12] have I mean they haven't even tapped
[2875.32 - 2878.88] into what's in a sweet potato yet
[2877.12 - 2880.24] because no one wants to spend the money
[2878.88 - 2881.64] research and science doesn't want to
[2880.24 - 2883.56] know what's in a sweet potato cuz it's
[2881.64 - 2885.36] going to make people buy more of
[2883.56 - 2887.28] them and then you know what they're
[2885.36 - 2888.56] going to see doctors less and women are
[2887.28 - 2891.12] going to see doctors less because
[2888.56 - 2892.76] they're eating their sweet potatoes said
[2891.12 - 2895.12] they don't want the research of science
[2892.76 - 2896.16] doesn't want you eating sweet potatoes
[2895.12 - 2898.48] no
[2896.16 - 2902.80] way why why why would they want you to
[2898.48 - 2904.56] do that so you know it's about lowering
[2902.80 - 2905.72] your fats though at the same time so
[2904.56 - 2907.48] that means you could still do some
[2905.72 - 2909.20] healthy fats like the avocado some hem
[2907.48 - 2911.40] seeds some some walnuts and stuff like
[2909.20 - 2913.00] throw walnuts in a salad absolutely you
[2911.40 - 2914.64] can still do these have a little bit of
[2913.00 - 2917.32] olive oil if you really
[2914.64 - 2919.16] want but just don't overdo it don't
[2917.32 - 2920.84] overdo it and get more of the fresh
[2919.16 - 2923.52] fruits and vegetables and you're you'll
[2920.84 - 2926.84] see your high blood pressure come down
[2923.52 - 2928.76] you'll see it come down you really will
[2926.84 - 2931.12] get on some magnesium I think that would
[2928.76 - 2932.52] be great for you get on some magnesium
[2931.12 - 2934.16] without a doubt I like the Magnesium
[2932.52 - 2935.76] glycinate I feel like it works really
[2934.16 - 2937.00] good I know it works Spirit tells me it
[2935.76 - 2939.48] works I've given it to people over the
[2937.00 - 2941.68] years I like magnesium glycinate that
[2939.48 - 2943.60] that one works natural Cal is okay you
[2941.68 - 2946.76] know that's all right just make sure you
[2943.60 - 2948.52] pour hot water into the cup when you put
[2946.76 - 2950.04] a teaspoon of natural c in there or two
[2948.52 - 2951.48] teaspoons of natural C make sure you
[2950.04 - 2953.08] pour you know really like you were going
[2951.48 - 2956.76] to make a hot cup of tea you pour the
[2953.08 - 2959.24] water in there because by doing that it
[2956.76 - 2961.68] uh it it it really activates it the
[2959.24 - 2963.00] right way makes it better so if you
[2961.68 - 2966.20] really need to do something like that
[2963.00 - 2968.24] you can so that's great now that's great
[2966.20 - 2970.72] nettle Leaf is a great one circumin is
[2968.24 - 2972.64] great for for for taking care of CoQ10 I
[2970.72 - 2974.80] like that one too circumin is a great
[2972.64 - 2976.20] one lots of turmeric that's a great one
[2974.80 - 2978.16] tumeric Ginger shots are great for
[2976.20 - 2980.48] lowering blood pressure and turmeric
[2978.16 - 2982.00] ginger shots are great for raising blood
[2980.48 - 2983.12] pressure for people with low blood
[2982.00 - 2986.00] pressure because they're number one
[2983.12 - 2988.52] they're antiviral number two they help
[2986.00 - 2989.96] they help with the adrenals too A lot of
[2988.52 - 2992.96] people with the low blood pressure that
[2989.96 - 2994.88] are that are viral the really low blood
[2992.96 - 2996.52] pressure and they're viral they they
[2994.88 - 2998.24] they all have a adrenal issues and
[2996.52 - 2999.84] adrenal dysfunction adrenal adrenal
[2998.24 - 3001.04] issues those people with low blood
[2999.84 - 3003.84] pressure you might want to consider
[3001.04 - 3006.20] doing ashwagandha that would be really
[3003.84 - 3009.08] good you might even want to consider
[3006.20 - 3011.12] doing licorice I think licorice would be
[3009.08 - 3013.28] fantastic for the people with low blood
[3011.12 - 3014.52] pressure I mean talk to your doctor talk
[3013.28 - 3015.96] to your practitioner about it but I
[3014.52 - 3017.92] would do licorice root you could do
[3015.96 - 3019.68] licorice tea every single day or go to
[3017.92 - 3021.04] my directory at Medical medium.com and
[3019.68 - 3023.64] get the right licorice
[3021.04 - 3026.24] tincture the one without
[3023.64 - 3028.32] alcohol which is a bon IED mess that
[3026.24 - 3030.32] alcohols in tinctures that's that's just
[3028.32 - 3032.40] that's terrible that's terrible it's
[3030.32 - 3033.68] travesty all on its own so make sure
[3032.40 - 3035.48] that you you know you get the licorish
[3033.68 - 3037.16] root you can do licorice root tea people
[3035.48 - 3040.00] with low blood pressure licorice root
[3037.16 - 3042.12] tea you can do that all right that's
[3040.00 - 3045.24] great nettle leaf tea that's also pretty
[3042.12 - 3047.48] good but the licorice root is great so
[3045.24 - 3049.32] consider that and and then the
[3047.48 - 3050.80] ashwaganda get your adrenal see the
[3049.32 - 3052.76] licorish and the ashwaganda are going to
[3050.80 - 3054.44] help somebody with low blood pressure
[3052.76 - 3056.12] with the adrenal problems causing part
[3054.44 - 3057.60] of the low pressure being so low it's
[3056.12 - 3059.56] also going to help with the viruses too
[3057.60 - 3061.72] licorice help with the virus will help
[3059.56 - 3064.24] with the viruses somebody with low blood
[3061.72 - 3066.92] pressure and then get your diet's right
[3064.24 - 3068.92] no cheese no Dairy no milk no butter no
[3066.92 - 3071.08] eggs be
[3068.92 - 3073.64] cautious keep your animal proteins low

[3079.08 - 3085.00] greens more celery juice and you'll get
[3082.48 - 3087.24] the blood pressure up you'll get the
[3085.00 - 3088.52] blood pressure up people who worry about
[3087.24 - 3091.04] the blood pressure going down from
[3088.52 - 3093.80] celery juice no you go get it up but you
[3091.04 - 3096.40] you can't just do a celery juice and not
[3093.80 - 3098.52] eat that day or that morning you can't
[3096.40 - 3100.28] you have to eat too people with low
[3098.52 - 3102.00] blood pressure have to eat every hour
[3100.28 - 3103.48] and a half you have to eat something

[3103.48 - 3109.24] and graze whether it's celery sticks and
[3107.04 - 3111.44] apple slices whether it's apple slices
[3109.24 - 3113.08] and dates whether it's you know a piece

[3120.76 - 3125.64] graze if you have low blood pressure you
[3123.40 - 3126.88] can't just go hours without food because
[3125.64 - 3128.32] you know what's going to happen your
[3126.88 - 3130.44] blood pressure is going to drop lower
[3128.32 - 3131.84] and lower and lower and then when you
[3130.44 - 3133.16] drink your celery juice and it's the
[3131.84 - 3135.32] only thing you had that day you're going
[3133.16 - 3136.88] to be like I I told you it would drop my

[3138.64 - 3141.64] should have drank this celery juice no
[3140.16 - 3143.60] it's not how it works the celery juice
[3141.64 - 3146.12] is there to balance it and bring it up
[3143.60 - 3148.28] but you got to eat and I noticed low
[3146.12 - 3150.48] blood pressure people they don't eat
[3148.28 - 3154.20] much at all they eat like birds even
[3150.48 - 3156.44] though birds eat a lot they eat like
