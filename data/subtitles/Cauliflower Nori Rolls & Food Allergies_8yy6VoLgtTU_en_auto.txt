[24.48 - 28.16] a big difference right there
[25.84 - 29.28] the not so sick can afford to play
[28.16 - 31.76] around
[29.28 - 33.28] and dive into all the different trends
[31.76 - 34.64] that don't really work
[33.28 - 36.32] they might feel a little bit better they
[34.64 - 38.80] get rid of processed foods
[36.32 - 40.24] they might go vegan they might go clean
[38.80 - 41.60] animal protein
[40.24 - 43.20] and they think they got it all down
[41.60 - 44.88] they're not so sick they get some
[43.20 - 46.88] improvements and then they go on that
[44.88 - 48.72] merry-go-round out there with so many
[46.88 - 50.08] different talking heads in the industry

[216.72 - 219.52] right here just some beautiful fresh
[218.00 - 222.32] cilantro right here
[219.52 - 223.12] the leafy green that's what it is the
[222.32 - 224.96] leafy green
[223.12 - 227.52] how much cilantro are you guys eating
[224.96 - 229.36] every day because

[229.36 - 234.96] every day you can make it your salad
[232.24 - 236.56] and how healing is that how healing is
[234.96 - 237.52] that that's a really powerful healing
[236.56 - 239.52] tool
[237.52 - 240.72] that alone i got some green onions i
[239.52 - 242.64] don't know how you guys feel like
[240.72 - 244.24] about green onions throw that one in the
[242.64 - 246.48] air a little bit
[244.24 - 248.96] right but the green onions i got going
[246.48 - 252.72] on i got dolls right here look at that
[248.96 - 255.04] atlantic coast dulce in my hands that's
[252.72 - 258.40] medicinal all on its own
[255.04 - 261.36] that's a great one we got some beautiful
[258.40 - 263.04] tomatoes right here too
[261.36 - 265.12] i could see we're totally being shadowed
[263.04 - 267.68] today i heard that too
[265.12 - 268.56] i heard that too michelle totally
[267.68 - 271.76] michelle l
[268.56 - 274.96] totally shadowed lately right and got
[271.76 - 274.96] some beautiful cauliflower
[276.48 - 282.56] and um got some oranges
[279.68 - 284.32] two lemons we'll do stuff with that got
[282.56 - 287.52] some hot peppers
[284.32 - 290.00] got two nice hot peppers here these are
[287.52 - 293.92] sweet and hot put together
[290.00 - 298.32] these are all different medicinal
[293.92 - 301.20] foods the dulce is a medicinal food
[298.32 - 302.80] the dolce takes toxic heavy metals out
[301.20 - 305.28] of the intestinal tract
[302.80 - 306.16] really easily so that's some medicinal
[305.28 - 309.28] food
[306.16 - 311.28] onions are anti viral anti pathogen
[309.28 - 314.40] antibacterial
[311.28 - 316.48] so what the onions are cilantro helps to
[314.40 - 319.36] get rid of metals too
[316.48 - 321.28] but it's also a highly mineralized
[319.36 - 323.68] alkalizing green
[321.28 - 325.28] so this is really really good lucy cone
[323.68 - 328.64] good to see you
[325.28 - 330.16] and we got tomatoes anytime you see them
[328.64 - 332.48] this is a prime example of what we're
[330.16 - 334.00] talking about today
[332.48 - 335.84] you go on the search you're looking for
[334.00 - 337.76] help you're looking for answers
[335.84 - 339.20] you're maybe you're not so sick maybe
[337.76 - 340.80] you're really sick
[339.20 - 343.20] maybe you got a lot of different
[340.80 - 344.24] conditions diagnosed with like a few
[343.20 - 346.24] different conditions you got
[344.24 - 348.40] neurological lyme you've got the lupus
[346.24 - 349.84] you may be diagnosed with fibro
[348.40 - 351.92] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[349.84 - 354.00] maybe you're diagnosed with all eczema
[351.92 - 355.68] really bad and then you hear don't eat a
[354.00 - 356.72] tomato because somebody in the health
[355.68 - 358.80] movement who seems
[356.72 - 360.16] prominent somebody in the health
[358.80 - 361.44] movement who seems like they know what
[360.16 - 362.72] they're talking about even though they
[361.44 - 364.08] just started in the health movement
[362.72 - 366.80] pretty recently
[364.08 - 368.64] like just just like five years into it
[366.80 - 370.56] that's all or six years into it
[368.64 - 372.00] they decided to just get into it and
[370.56 - 374.16] they're a doctor or something
[372.00 - 376.72] and they tell you don't eat tomatoes
[374.16 - 377.84] tomatoes are really bad for you they can
[376.72 - 379.92] they're so bad for you they're
[377.84 - 380.72] problematic that's a mistake all on its
[379.92 - 382.88] own
[380.72 - 384.56] and then you get other people in the
[382.88 - 387.52] health movement too
[384.56 - 388.80] that say hey night shades they're really
[387.52 - 390.48] bad for you the calls
[388.80 - 392.16] cause problems they'll cause problems
[390.48 - 393.44] this is a private example why people
[392.16 - 395.44] don't heal
[393.44 - 397.20] and sure if you're not so sick and you
[395.44 - 399.04] get rid of processed foods and you kick
[397.20 - 401.84] those out when you get rid of the fried
[399.04 - 403.76] greasy foods and you start exercising
[401.84 - 405.60] and you start juicing something or doing
[403.76 - 406.08] some green powdered shakes somewhere and
[405.60 - 407.68] you're
[406.08 - 409.68] you're in you know you're seeing
[407.68 - 411.92] improvements you're doing the keto thing
[409.68 - 413.44] or maybe you go plant-based keto
[411.92 - 415.36] and you're picking up a notch you're
[413.44 - 417.20] like hey oh wait i got it i got it all
[415.36 - 419.04] sewed up now
[417.20 - 420.64] but if you really get sick it doesn't
[419.04 - 422.08] work that way you'll find that keto it
[420.64 - 423.84] doesn't work you'll find that even
[422.08 - 425.68] plant-based vegan doesn't work you'll
[423.84 - 426.56] find that all these things don't really
[425.68 - 428.32] work
[426.56 - 431.04] and then start stuff starts happening
[428.32 - 433.76] your teeth start falling apart over time
[431.04 - 435.20] the weight comes back on and you're out
[433.76 - 437.20] there listening well listen to people
[435.20 - 438.72] it's like don't ever eat a tomato people
[437.20 - 440.40] in the health movement like don't eat a
[438.72 - 443.44] tomato don't eat a tomato
[440.40 - 445.20] this isn't this is one prime example of
[443.44 - 446.88] the misinformation that's out there that
[445.20 - 450.08] stops people from healing and
[446.88 - 452.00] here's the most important part if i can
[450.08 - 455.04] get your ear right now you guys
[452.00 - 455.76] okay the most important part tell me if
[455.04 - 457.76] i'm wrong
[455.76 - 459.12] you guys tell me if i'm wrong about this
[457.76 - 461.68] i can handle it
[459.12 - 463.76] i can take it so you can tell me okay
[461.68 - 467.36] you can be like you're wrong aw
[463.76 - 469.68] you're wrong and check this out
[467.36 - 470.80] okay so you get told not to eat the
[469.68 - 473.20] tomatoes
[470.80 - 474.24] you get told not to eat a potato the
[473.20 - 476.56] nightshades
[474.24 - 478.64] you get told not to do this or that or
[476.56 - 479.60] stay away from fruit with all the fruit
[478.64 - 481.76] fear
[479.60 - 484.72] but you're being told by people that
[481.76 - 486.72] don't even know why anybody's sick
[484.72 - 488.16] they don't know why someone's sick with
[486.72 - 490.48] mystery neurological symptoms
[488.16 - 492.08] neurological fatigue
[490.48 - 493.52] that's a term for medical medium that's
[492.08 - 495.04] medical meme information that's got out
[493.52 - 496.88] there neurological fatigue
[495.04 - 499.20] that means that medical medium
[496.88 - 499.68] information discovered that fatigue was
[499.20 - 502.72] actually
[499.68 - 504.24] neuro neurological and then we put that
[502.72 - 506.24] information out there and published it
[504.24 - 509.60] and everything
[506.24 - 511.60] and but think about it
[509.60 - 513.44] here we're taking all this guidance from
[511.60 - 514.88] all the gurus and all the people in the
[513.44 - 516.96] health movement and all the special
[514.88 - 518.00] doctors and all the people right lorena
[516.96 - 521.12] good to see you
[518.00 - 522.96] we're taking all this guidance
[521.12 - 524.64] but yet they don't know why someone's
[522.96 - 526.08] sick with lupus they don't know why
[524.64 - 527.52] somebody's stick with fibromyalgia
[526.08 - 529.76] hashimoto's they don't know why you have
[527.52 - 530.96] nodules on your thyroid you guys
[529.76 - 532.72] they don't know why you're dizzy and you
[530.96 - 533.92] got balance problems and vertigo they
[532.72 - 534.88] don't know why you got ringing in the
[533.92 - 536.88] ears
[534.88 - 537.92] nancy miller i was told for years to
[536.88 - 540.88] avoid tomatoes
[537.92 - 543.36] until i really started to learn from you
[540.88 - 546.64] i have completely changed my diet
[543.36 - 548.80] and feel amazing and love tomatoes
[546.64 - 550.16] love tomatoes so this great comment
[548.80 - 553.76] thank you for um
[550.16 - 556.40] talking about that but so
[553.76 - 557.12] we got so-called experts out there
[556.40 - 559.60] shannon
[557.12 - 560.48] says thank you for getting me over my
[559.60 - 563.84] nightshade
[560.48 - 566.80] fear been enjoying many yummy steamed
[563.84 - 566.80] potatoes
[567.28 - 574.48] but what happens is we get told you guys
[570.72 - 575.68] we get told that we should avoid certain
[574.48 - 577.04] things
[575.68 - 578.72] and that's what we're told but we're
[577.04 - 580.08] told by people that don't know why we're
[578.72 - 581.12] sick
[580.08 - 583.04] they don't know anything about
[581.12 - 584.72] epstein-barr unless they learned it from
[583.04 - 586.08] medical medium
[584.72 - 588.08] they don't know why any they don't know
[586.08 - 590.40] anything about viruses unless they
[588.08 - 591.84] learned it about they learned viruses
[590.40 - 593.84] from the
[591.84 - 595.76] plague that's been happening in the last
[593.84 - 599.04] year year and a half
[595.76 - 603.12] a year and whatever a few months so they
[599.04 - 606.32] they now they know the term virus
[603.12 - 609.04] patina says nightshades don't agree with
[606.32 - 610.96] all of us i break out in eczema but
[609.04 - 615.20] that's only with
[610.96 - 618.16] um auburn's always been that
[615.20 - 619.60] way since a child even though it was
[618.16 - 622.08] homegrown
[619.60 - 623.36] so the thing is with nightshades fatima
[622.08 - 625.20] is what i've seen
[623.36 - 626.56] is people don't use them right right
[625.20 - 627.28] they don't use them really use them
[626.56 - 629.60] right so
[627.28 - 631.20] what to do is they'll have tomato sauce
[629.60 - 632.96] filled with all this other bad stuff and
[631.20 - 634.72] that's aggravating on
[632.96 - 636.64] eczema psoriasis because there's all
[634.72 - 638.40] this fat in the tomato sauce that's one
[636.64 - 639.84] thing right there that's a mistake made
[638.40 - 641.68] they'll take potatoes and they have
[639.84 - 644.64] butter in their potatoes no one eats a
[641.68 - 646.16] plain potato unless it's medical medium
[644.64 - 647.68] unless it's medical medium information
[646.16 - 650.40] nobody eats a plain potato
[647.68 - 651.36] nobody eats a steamed potato nobody even
[650.40 - 653.28] steams them
[651.36 - 654.56] if people steam them now it's medical
[653.28 - 656.16] medium information
[654.56 - 658.00] very few people i've ever met in the
[656.16 - 660.80] world out of the hundreds of thousands
[658.00 - 662.56] i've talked to over the last 35 years
[660.80 - 664.72] very few people ever just steamed a
[662.56 - 667.92] potato
[664.72 - 669.76] very few people and so what they do
[667.92 - 671.12] though is they stick things in potato
[669.76 - 673.76] and on potato that feed
[671.12 - 675.76] bugs and then the person gets a problem
[673.76 - 677.52] and then they think the potato caused it
[675.76 - 680.32] but the potato didn't cause it
[677.52 - 682.40] same thing with tomatoes they'll have
[680.32 - 686.00] chicken parmesan
[682.40 - 689.44] with cheese right mozzarella cheese
[686.00 - 691.52] sauce they'll have and the sauce
[689.44 - 693.20] the tomato they'll think to tomatoes
[691.52 - 694.32] aggravating them when it's not it's all
[693.20 - 697.12] the fat from the chicken
[694.32 - 699.04] all the oil thrown in the sauce and then
[697.12 - 701.04] it's of course the cheese feeding any
[699.04 - 703.36] kind of viruses
[701.04 - 704.64] and things like that so that's important
[703.36 - 707.60] to know
[704.64 - 708.88] if you take a fresh ripe tomato if
[707.60 - 711.04] you're somebody with eczema
[708.88 - 712.88] psoriasis you take a fresh ripe tomato
[711.04 - 715.04] and you cut a piece off and you eat it
[712.88 - 716.00] nothing's going to happen to your eczema
[715.04 - 717.36] nothing's going to happen to your
[716.00 - 720.64] psoriasis
[717.36 - 722.80] but nobody eats a tomato by itself
[720.64 - 724.56] and another thing too is i'll take it
[722.80 - 725.76] down a little further when it comes down
[724.56 - 728.84] to peppers
[725.76 - 732.08] if you eat your pepper green it's not
[728.84 - 734.08] ripe that's like eating a green banana
[732.08 - 736.00] it's not ripe it's not gonna agree with
[734.08 - 740.56] you something that's
[736.00 - 742.16] so not ripe won't agree with someone
[740.56 - 743.68] because it's not supposed to be
[742.16 - 745.44] you're not supposed to be eating a green
[743.68 - 747.52] bell pepper or green pepper
[745.44 - 749.20] those are not ripe at all you're not
[747.52 - 751.36] supposed to be eating a green
[749.20 - 753.20] banana you're not supposed to be eating
[751.36 - 756.00] apple off a tree
[753.20 - 758.00] early in the season when it's hard as a
[756.00 - 759.92] rock it's not even ripened
[758.00 - 762.00] it's not going to agree with you you're
[759.92 - 764.32] not supposed to eat a berry
[762.00 - 765.36] that's red when it's supposed to be
[764.32 - 767.28] black
[765.36 - 769.36] or a berry that's green when it's
[767.28 - 772.40] supposed to be blue
[769.36 - 773.92] if you eat the unripe stuff
[772.40 - 775.60] you're it's not going to agree with you
[773.92 - 779.84] and here's something that happens with
[775.60 - 781.84] tomatoes people eat them not ripe enough
[779.84 - 783.68] it's not going to agree with someone
[781.84 - 787.20] tomato sauces are made with
[783.68 - 789.12] unripe tomatoes sometimes green tomatoes
[787.20 - 792.08] are in tomato sauces
[789.12 - 793.12] and so all these mistakes are made i'm
[792.08 - 795.04] just going to say this
[793.12 - 796.96] you guys in the medical meme community
[795.04 - 800.88] community have heard me say this before
[796.96 - 803.12] details matter or you're just
[800.88 - 805.44] lost and then you're gonna tell someone
[803.12 - 808.24] oh nightshades didn't work for me so
[805.44 - 810.48] stay away from it and you're gonna then
[808.24 - 812.12] compile that fear
[810.48 - 814.00] and you're gonna validate the
[812.12 - 816.40] misinformation that other health
[814.00 - 818.48] practitioners put out there every single
[816.40 - 821.20] day you're going to validate
[818.48 - 822.48] their misinformation and then a whole
[821.20 - 823.12] bunch of other people aren't going to
[822.48 - 825.28] heal
[823.12 - 827.48] because they're not going to know that
[825.28 - 830.72] there's foods that you can eat that are
[827.48 - 834.40] critical like antiviral foods
[830.72 - 836.80] in the nightshade family so the potato
[834.40 - 838.72] really important antiviral food for
[836.80 - 840.08] instance critical for colitis and
[838.72 - 843.12] crohn's and
[840.08 - 844.32] tomato tomatoes are antiviral too but
[843.12 - 846.88] you're not going to know
[844.32 - 848.40] to eat an antiviral tomato anymore and
[846.88 - 851.36] you're not going to note eat
[848.40 - 852.80] an antiviral potato anymore and you're
[851.36 - 854.32] just going to get lost
[852.80 - 856.08] and you're going to get lost because the
[854.32 - 858.48] misinformation is so rampant and the
[856.08 - 860.56] misinformation is so off
[858.48 - 861.52] so we got to keep that in mind how it
[860.56 - 863.44] works
[861.52 - 864.64] i love it when there's so many geniuses
[863.44 - 867.28] out there
[864.64 - 867.92] when you guys i don't know if you know
[867.28 - 870.96] this
[867.92 - 873.52] but up until outside of my
[870.96 - 875.04] private my private work that i've done
[873.52 - 876.48] all these years where people there was
[875.04 - 878.32] we had a waiting list
[876.48 - 879.84] over a million people around the world
[878.32 - 883.04] trying to get to talk to me
[879.84 - 885.68] i started in the 80s doing it
[883.04 - 887.28] i started when i was a kid doing the
[885.68 - 889.44] readings and working with people who are
[887.28 - 892.80] sick doctors were sending patients to me
[889.44 - 895.04] all through the 1990s just droves of
[892.80 - 896.40] patients coming to me through the 1990s
[895.04 - 898.48] through the 2000s
[896.40 - 899.60] and because i was known as the bizarre
[898.48 - 902.00] symptoms guy
[899.60 - 904.00] that's what i was known as i was known
[902.00 - 904.56] as the bizarre symptoms guy because
[904.00 - 906.16] nobody
[904.56 - 907.60] knew when they were sick with all their
[906.16 - 909.04] fatigue and their aches and pains and
[907.60 - 910.48] all the strange symptoms nobody knew
[909.04 - 912.80] what caused any of it
[910.48 - 913.92] so i had to teach individual doctors all
[912.80 - 915.68] through these years
[913.92 - 917.28] i had to teach individual doctors about
[915.68 - 918.80] being low-fat
[917.28 - 920.72] you know and it bit me on the butt a
[918.80 - 921.84] little bit it bit me on the butt to give
[920.72 - 923.84] out all that info
[921.84 - 926.24] and not book it put it in the book
[923.84 - 928.64] earlier on in the early 90s right
[926.24 - 930.00] so i gave out a lot of medical medium
[928.64 - 932.16] pieces
[930.00 - 933.76] and those pieces really needed to find
[932.16 - 935.44] their home so you can get the whole
[933.76 - 936.88] puzzle and know all the details right
[935.44 - 940.64] details matter to heal
[936.88 - 942.48] when you're really sick but
[940.64 - 944.24] what i've learned is until medical
[942.48 - 946.16] medium information taught everybody why
[944.24 - 947.92] somebody has the tingle or the numbness
[946.16 - 949.28] or the burning mouth and burning pain in
[947.92 - 950.32] the burning jaw the pain in the neck
[949.28 - 952.00] that's mysterious
[950.32 - 953.52] the sciatic problems when you don't have
[952.00 - 956.24] a back injury
[953.52 - 957.68] when all that information when all that
[956.24 - 958.64] information got out there we finally
[957.68 - 960.40] knew
[958.64 - 961.84] and when the medical medium books were
[960.40 - 964.88] published right
[961.84 - 966.72] so this one right here in 2015 right the
[964.88 - 969.12] medical medium new edition
[966.72 - 970.56] that's that's the revised and expanded
[969.12 - 972.16] version you guys got to get that if you
[970.56 - 973.36] get a chance revise and expand it the
[972.16 - 975.76] new edition
[973.36 - 977.04] and it's on sale at amazon.com us right
[975.76 - 977.92] you can get it free of the lever if you
[977.04 - 979.44] want to
[977.92 - 981.04] i heard there's a long waiting list i
[979.44 - 984.64] wish i could do something about that
[981.04 - 986.48] at the libraries but the thing is is
[984.64 - 989.04] that this book right here blew
[986.48 - 990.16] the doors off of lyme disease so people
[989.04 - 992.16] can heal
[990.16 - 993.36] fibro chronic fatigue syndrome
[992.16 - 995.12] hashimoto's
[993.36 - 996.80] that's just some of the things right
[995.12 - 999.12] there right the candida
[996.80 - 1001.44] problems out there in the world and it
[999.12 - 1004.56] blew the roof off of all that
[1001.44 - 1004.88] and then then well right around that
[1004.56 - 1008.48] time
[1004.88 - 1009.20] 2015 all these newbie professionals got
[1008.48 - 1011.76] into
[1009.20 - 1012.80] health and wellness certain doctors that
[1011.76 - 1014.96] had a lot of money
[1012.80 - 1016.64] got a lot of advertising pr marketing
[1014.96 - 1017.52] put out a book saying hey don't eat
[1016.64 - 1019.60] tomatoes
[1017.52 - 1021.68] or put out this and that they never even
[1019.60 - 1024.72] knew to begin with why anybody was sick
[1021.68 - 1025.92] ever ever ever and the millions of women
[1024.72 - 1027.68] that have struggled and suffered and
[1025.92 - 1029.04] been into doctor's offices with mystery
[1027.68 - 1032.24] conditions and symptoms that were just
[1029.04 - 1033.92] given steroids and antibiotics
[1032.24 - 1036.24] until medical medium came out with the
[1033.92 - 1039.28] answers nobody knew anything about this
[1036.24 - 1041.20] this is just fact it's a published fact
[1039.28 - 1044.32] it's just fact
[1041.20 - 1046.16] so what i see now is hey
[1044.32 - 1047.76] go do corella that's what you should be
[1046.16 - 1050.32] doing as krill oh that's funny because
[1047.76 - 1051.52] you don't even know how cruella works
[1050.32 - 1053.36] and you don't even know why anybody's
[1051.52 - 1054.80] sick to begin with you should do butter
[1053.36 - 1056.08] in your coffee oh that's funny because
[1054.80 - 1058.40] you don't know why anybody's sick to
[1056.08 - 1060.40] begin with
[1058.40 - 1062.24] hey you should do you know fish oil oh
[1060.40 - 1064.84] that's another funny one too because you
[1062.24 - 1066.40] don't know why anybody's sick to begin
[1064.84 - 1068.96] with and
[1066.40 - 1069.60] you know tomatoes are bad for you if you
[1068.96 - 1070.96] have gout
[1069.60 - 1073.20] that's funny you don't even know the
[1070.96 - 1076.64] cause of gallon
[1073.20 - 1076.64] until medical medium information
[1077.12 - 1082.00] so it's not tomatoes it's whatever
[1079.76 - 1085.68] tomatoes are swimming in
[1082.00 - 1086.08] oil and fat and grease karen says so
[1085.68 - 1088.40] true
[1086.08 - 1089.92] i used to think that spaghetti sauce
[1088.40 - 1092.48] gave me problems
[1089.92 - 1094.00] because of the tomatoes wrong it's all
[1092.48 - 1096.00] the other stuff in the sauce
[1094.00 - 1097.68] i eat tomatoes now daily with medical
[1096.00 - 1099.20] medium 369.
[1097.68 - 1101.28] there's no dairy there's no gluten in
[1099.20 - 1104.08] there you're eating
[1101.28 - 1106.40] the tomatoes daily how come how come
[1104.08 - 1110.40] medical medium information
[1106.40 - 1112.24] has to be that window into sanity
[1110.40 - 1114.72] like i wake up every morning and i'm
[1112.24 - 1116.32] like i i can't even believe it
[1114.72 - 1118.40] how come with all the smart people and
[1116.32 - 1121.52] highly intelligent people and so smart
[1118.40 - 1122.08] health professionals and doctors and all
[1121.52 - 1123.84] the different
[1122.08 - 1125.20] stuff out there and everybody thinks
[1123.84 - 1127.76] they're a genius or they're or
[1125.20 - 1129.92] everybody's portrayed as a genius right
[1127.76 - 1131.52] but any but no one knows anything in the
[1129.92 - 1134.16] health movement
[1131.52 - 1135.60] yeah sure you can get a hip replacement
[1134.16 - 1137.84] but look what happened there with the
[1135.60 - 1140.00] hip replacements too
[1137.84 - 1142.16] they all got metal on metal and i
[1140.00 - 1144.00] remember those days i remember people
[1142.16 - 1145.44] filing into my office right they had a
[1144.00 - 1148.16] hip replacement
[1145.44 - 1149.12] they were sick as goats they come into
[1148.16 - 1151.12] my office
[1149.12 - 1153.36] and spirit of compassion would be like
[1151.12 - 1155.92] this person's hip replacement is eaten
[1153.36 - 1157.68] up they have to get to the doctor they
[1155.92 - 1161.52] have to cut them open
[1157.68 - 1163.84] look in there and see that the the
[1161.52 - 1166.16] joint in that hip is rubbing and
[1163.84 - 1168.80] grinding into metal
[1166.16 - 1170.48] right but those are nuts and bolts
[1168.80 - 1171.60] replacement parts chronic ill which
[1170.48 - 1172.96] became chron which is
[1171.60 - 1174.72] a mystery to people when they don't know
[1172.96 - 1177.04] what's causing in the moment but
[1174.72 - 1179.04] chronic illness is way more pets way
[1177.04 - 1181.12] past that
[1179.04 - 1182.72] but it's one thing if medical medium
[1181.12 - 1183.52] information knows a lot about chronic
[1182.72 - 1186.08] illness
[1183.52 - 1187.60] which is the mysteries to it all and
[1186.08 - 1190.72] teaching it out there but it's another
[1187.60 - 1193.68] if i have to correct the little stuff
[1190.72 - 1195.76] the little stuff like the mistakes made
[1193.68 - 1196.56] about fresh tomatoes the mistakes made
[1195.76 - 1200.40] about
[1196.56 - 1203.52] simple things simple things
[1200.40 - 1205.52] that's when it's just all ridiculous i
[1203.52 - 1206.00] remember 10 years ago like i'm gonna i'm
[1205.52 - 1207.84] gonna make
[1206.00 - 1209.28] sure that you know i was talking spirit
[1207.84 - 1209.76] compassion i'm gonna make sure i fix
[1209.28 - 1212.24] this
[1209.76 - 1214.08] nightshade problem because it they got
[1212.24 - 1216.08] it all wrong out there
[1214.08 - 1218.72] just give me a decade and i'll have that
[1216.08 - 1221.20] fixed just give me a decade and then
[1218.72 - 1222.16] every single year some other new
[1221.20 - 1223.92] comes out
[1222.16 - 1225.52] some kind of practitioner or some doctor
[1223.92 - 1226.32] that writes a book or somebody that gets
[1225.52 - 1228.64] on some you know
[1226.32 - 1230.40] some show because they're pr marketing
[1228.64 - 1231.92] people they hire puts them on some show
[1230.40 - 1232.72] some when they start talking bad about
[1231.92 - 1235.84] nightshades

[1295.36 - 1301.68] let's grind up some cauliflower
[1299.20 - 1304.08] let's do that i'm gonna cut this
[1301.68 - 1305.68] cauliflower in half right here
[1304.08 - 1308.16] you guys following me we're making nori
[1305.68 - 1309.60] rolls what i like about knowing rolls
[1308.16 - 1312.72] it's easy
[1309.60 - 1314.08] it's it's fun unless you guys think it's
[1312.72 - 1315.68] not fun and i got
[1314.08 - 1318.00] got respect for you it's if you don't
[1315.68 - 1319.92] think it's fun of course of course it
[1318.00 - 1323.28] may not be fun for somebody
[1319.92 - 1324.80] i like doing it i like it a lot
[1323.28 - 1328.16] some grinding up some cauliflower and
[1324.80 - 1328.16] put a little bit more in here too
[1328.32 - 1335.60] amy so i'm allergic to celery well
[1332.32 - 1340.00] what happens when you have celery
[1335.60 - 1340.00] right what happens when you have celery
[1340.32 - 1343.12] did you go to your doctor because your
[1341.52 - 1345.12] throat's closing up did you go to the
[1343.12 - 1348.16] emergency room
[1345.12 - 1350.32] is that why so you ate a piece of celery
[1348.16 - 1354.24] your throat closed up
[1350.32 - 1357.60] no right no so you went to your doctor
[1354.24 - 1357.60] and they just threw that on the test
[1358.16 - 1362.80] um food allergy tests the ones where
[1361.36 - 1366.56] they tell you you're allergic to 10
[1362.80 - 1369.60] 15 20 things but yet you can eat those
[1366.56 - 1372.84] things and not have a problem
[1369.60 - 1374.00] uh those things i've always seen as
[1372.84 - 1376.72] corrupt
[1374.00 - 1378.08] for sure i mean listen to your doctor
[1376.72 - 1379.92] dude he tells you he tells you to stay
[1378.08 - 1383.44] off celery you stay off celery
[1379.92 - 1386.88] but if it was me i i you know i
[1383.44 - 1388.56] i would just am i am i choking when i
[1386.88 - 1390.00] have a celery stick all of a sudden my
[1388.56 - 1392.40] throat closes up and i can't breathe and
[1390.00 - 1394.16] i'm having anaphylactic shock
[1392.40 - 1395.44] if that's happening then yeah stay away
[1394.16 - 1398.48] from celery
[1395.44 - 1398.48] stay away from celery
[1398.56 - 1402.16] but when it comes down to tests for food
[1400.08 - 1404.40] allergies and the all-cat test and
[1402.16 - 1405.84] everything else around it all i've never
[1404.40 - 1407.68] seen things so skewed
[1405.84 - 1408.88] i have a doctor actually calling me any
[1407.68 - 1411.04] minute too
[1408.88 - 1412.80] because he's he's gonna he's a doctor
[1411.04 - 1414.88] that does all the tests and
[1412.80 - 1416.80] he did he pulled some blood work and i
[1414.88 - 1418.96] asked for all the food allergy tests so
[1416.80 - 1421.84] i got a doctor coming in right now
[1418.96 - 1421.84] calling and
[1422.40 - 1426.24] but i still want to make this stuff here
[1424.64 - 1427.20] so hopefully it doesn't interrupt us too
[1426.24 - 1428.40] much
[1427.20 - 1430.16] i think what happens is when you're
[1428.40 - 1432.00] doing the food allergy test it's easy to
[1430.16 - 1435.12] get thrown
[1432.00 - 1440.56] really easy to be thrown on that
[1435.12 - 1440.56] and i think that here he is
[1441.60 - 1446.16] hey dr blott so hey how did my blood
[1444.88 - 1447.92] work go
[1446.16 - 1450.00] by the way i was i was really bummed out

[1616.24 - 1623.36] gotta keep moving make a little food
[1619.12 - 1628.88] here's how it works when you're allergic
[1623.36 - 1632.56] to gluten whether a test shows it or not
[1628.88 - 1635.28] the gluten feeds bugs nobody knew
[1632.56 - 1636.80] that medical medium information is the
[1635.28 - 1639.44] first to tell everybody
[1636.80 - 1640.00] that the reason why anybody sensitive to
[1639.44 - 1643.36] gluten on
[1640.00 - 1646.88] any level is because it feeds pathogens
[1643.36 - 1648.24] it feeds pathogens 35 years ago
[1646.88 - 1649.36] i was telling everybody stay off of
[1648.24 - 1650.96] wheat stay off the wheat stay off of
[1649.36 - 1652.08] wheat stay off of wheat just constantly
[1650.96 - 1653.68] stay off a wheat wheat
[1652.08 - 1654.96] wheat stay off a week everybody looked
[1653.68 - 1655.60] at me like i just came off of the
[1654.96 - 1658.80] spaceship
[1655.60 - 1661.52] i had 10 heads because it was the most
[1658.80 - 1663.52] craziest bizarre thing anybody's ever
[1661.52 - 1664.96] heard is stay off a wheat so they would
[1663.52 - 1666.56] all go wait a minute whole wheat
[1664.96 - 1668.08] whole wheat whole wheat is good for you
[1666.56 - 1669.04] right did you guys know the health
[1668.08 - 1672.24] movement
[1669.04 - 1672.80] believe that whole wheat was incredible
[1672.24 - 1676.24] for you
[1672.80 - 1679.20] the health movement it was processed
[1676.24 - 1680.56] bread people here's you guys got to keep
[1679.20 - 1683.12] in mind
[1680.56 - 1684.00] the only thing that the health movement
[1683.12 - 1687.04] was worried about
[1684.00 - 1689.92] 30 years ago the only thing
[1687.04 - 1691.20] with bread was that it was stripped of
[1689.92 - 1694.08] nutrients
[1691.20 - 1696.08] not that it did any harm it was just
[1694.08 - 1698.40] void of nutrients this is really
[1696.08 - 1699.28] important information right here that's
[1698.40 - 1701.04] the only thing
[1699.28 - 1702.40] the health movement thought about with
[1701.04 - 1704.00] bread
[1702.40 - 1705.60] they didn't they didn't know anything
[1704.00 - 1707.44] about all these different things with
[1705.60 - 1711.12] gluten or anything they just knew
[1707.44 - 1714.72] that bread was processed so that that
[1711.12 - 1716.56] white bread that was squishy was bad for
[1714.72 - 1718.40] you because it was void of nutrients
[1716.56 - 1720.16] that's the only thing the health
[1718.40 - 1723.52] movement knew about it
[1720.16 - 1726.24] and then me came along and i said it's
[1723.52 - 1727.92] the wheat it's the wheat it's the wheat
[1726.24 - 1729.44] it's the gluten it's the wheat it's the
[1727.92 - 1730.48] gluten it's the wheat and they'd be like
[1729.44 - 1733.44] no no it's not
[1730.48 - 1735.04] wheat because we're doing nutrition and
[1733.44 - 1737.92] nutritional wheat
[1735.04 - 1739.68] we're doing the whole grain wheat whole
[1737.92 - 1740.88] grain wheat berries whole grain wheat
[1739.68 - 1744.08] fiber bread
[1740.88 - 1746.24] whole grain wheat germ you guys
[1744.08 - 1748.88] the health movement believed in wheat
[1746.24 - 1752.80] germ lorraine elle says this is true
[1748.88 - 1754.80] they ran out and the whole movement
[1752.80 - 1756.64] believed in wheat germ it didn't matter
[1754.80 - 1757.76] if you were plant-based didn't matter if
[1756.64 - 1759.60] you were vegetarian
[1757.76 - 1761.52] didn't matter if you were the cleanest
[1759.60 - 1762.08] eater the animal protein eater you can
[1761.52 - 1764.56] find
[1762.08 - 1765.76] the entire movement believed wheat germ
[1764.56 - 1767.60] was good for you
[1765.76 - 1769.36] i'm the one that was screaming top the
[1767.60 - 1771.44] top of the mountain tops
[1769.36 - 1772.64] that the gluten and the weed is all bad
[1771.44 - 1775.52] it's all bad
[1772.64 - 1777.84] then everybody hated me for it but took
[1775.52 - 1779.36] years of that work for us to get to this
[1777.84 - 1782.64] point now
[1779.36 - 1783.68] but here's the funny thing even with all
[1782.64 - 1785.20] that i've done
[1783.68 - 1787.04] they still don't know why gluten even
[1785.20 - 1789.44] does anything
[1787.04 - 1790.72] it feeds the bugs i've been saying this
[1789.44 - 1793.20] and what you're going to get out of me
[1790.72 - 1795.60] is consistency going all the way back
[1793.20 - 1797.40] from childhood it's always going to be
[1795.60 - 1799.52] consistency it's not going to be
[1797.40 - 1800.64] non-contradictive and everything that's
[1799.52 - 1803.20] medical medium
[1800.64 - 1805.36] is never proven wrong it only eventually
[1803.20 - 1808.48] gets proven right
[1805.36 - 1809.84] but it never gets proven wrong it's got
[1808.48 - 1811.52] the track record
[1809.84 - 1813.60] medical medium information has never
[1811.52 - 1816.08] been proved wrong once you guys
[1813.60 - 1817.20] never ever been proved wrong once by any
[1816.08 - 1820.56] doctor by any
[1817.20 - 1822.72] by any institution by any sciences
[1820.56 - 1823.60] institution by anywhere it's only been
[1822.72 - 1825.84] proven right
[1823.60 - 1828.08] and a little bit at a time it's proven
[1825.84 - 1828.08] right
[1828.80 - 1832.24] gluten feeds the bugs that are inside of
[1831.60 - 1835.68] us
[1832.24 - 1836.16] so the bugs eat it that's the only
[1835.68 - 1840.16] reason
[1836.16 - 1841.04] why wheat gluten or gluten is bad for
[1840.16 - 1844.72] you
[1841.04 - 1846.80] or problematic because
[1844.72 - 1848.48] narashini and throw info from above
[1846.80 - 1850.00] exactly since i was a child has been
[1848.48 - 1853.28] saying the same thing since i was
[1850.00 - 1855.20] a child all of it it's consistency
[1853.28 - 1856.56] not like the podcast doctors that say
[1855.20 - 1858.64] tomatoes are bad you should see what
[1856.56 - 1861.68] they were saying five years ago
[1858.64 - 1862.40] or two years ago or last year or three
[1861.68 - 1863.68] months ago
[1862.40 - 1865.28] they change but nobody holds them
[1863.68 - 1866.72] accountable for it's like no one's awake
[1865.28 - 1867.36] watching them or listening to them
[1866.72 - 1868.96] because i think
[1867.36 - 1870.40] too they're circulating all these new
[1868.96 - 1872.08] people from all their ads
[1870.40 - 1873.76] so it's almost like a fresh start every
[1872.08 - 1874.72] 10 seconds they screw up and they get a
[1873.76 - 1875.92] fresh start
[1874.72 - 1877.68] because they got a million dollars a
[1875.92 - 1879.04] month going into ads did you know that
[1877.68 - 1881.44] do you know that all these guys have a
[1879.04 - 1883.12] million dollars a month going into ads
[1881.44 - 1885.04] to sell all their garbage and everything
[1883.12 - 1886.40] and to get new people on board to hear
[1885.04 - 1887.84] about tomato being bad
[1886.40 - 1889.68] they get a million dollars a month going
[1887.84 - 1891.84] into ads
[1889.68 - 1893.20] it's it's incredible you guys you
[1891.84 - 1896.32] wouldn't even believe it
[1893.20 - 1898.40] you wouldn't even believe it there's a
[1896.32 - 1901.52] difference between anaphylaxis
[1898.40 - 1903.92] shock hives
[1901.52 - 1905.12] there's a difference between that and
[1903.92 - 1907.68] what happens when
[1905.12 - 1909.28] you're getting real food allergies in a
[1907.68 - 1911.20] different way so there's two kinds of
[1909.28 - 1914.56] food allergies the food allergy
[1911.20 - 1918.56] if you get anaphylactic shock that means
[1914.56 - 1922.32] whatever that was like peanut butter
[1918.56 - 1925.44] was in something when it was injected
[1922.32 - 1928.56] into you from the outside of the body
[1925.44 - 1930.00] okay this is why i tell people do not
[1928.56 - 1933.04] get b12 shots
[1930.00 - 1936.16] do not get b12 shots do not get b12
[1933.04 - 1937.44] shots i say this all the time do not get
[1936.16 - 1939.84] b12 shots
[1937.44 - 1940.48] you will eventually get anaphylaxis
[1939.84 - 1943.28] shock
[1940.48 - 1945.36] from your b12 if you've had too many b12
[1943.28 - 1947.12] shots as the years go by
[1945.36 - 1948.80] your body will build an antibody to the
[1947.12 - 1950.80] b12 because it's entering on the outside
[1948.80 - 1952.32] of the body which is through your skin
[1950.80 - 1954.24] on the outside of the body not
[1952.32 - 1955.92] intravenously in your vein but on the
[1954.24 - 1958.40] outside of your body
[1955.92 - 1959.60] and eventually because of that your
[1958.40 - 1960.08] immune system is just gonna be like
[1959.60 - 1961.44] that's an
[1960.08 - 1963.52] enemy that's an enemy because it's
[1961.44 - 1965.20] coming in the wrong way it's not coming
[1963.52 - 1966.96] in through the mouth orally and we're
[1965.20 - 1968.56] going to build an antibody to it and
[1966.96 - 1970.32] when that's going to then that's going
[1968.56 - 1973.76] to depend on how someone's going to
[1970.32 - 1973.76] react to it eventually
[1974.40 - 1978.48] so that's how things work it's like a
[1977.76 - 1980.40] bee sting
[1978.48 - 1983.04] you get stung by a bee the reason why
[1980.40 - 1985.20] the pain is there
[1983.04 - 1988.24] reason why the pain is so bad when
[1985.20 - 1992.16] you're stung by a bee is because
[1988.24 - 1996.08] your body your body is like sending an
[1992.16 - 1999.44] army to that spot and then it swells up
[1996.08 - 2000.32] it swells up because you're not supposed
[1999.44 - 2002.48] to enter things
[2000.32 - 2005.92] and that's that's the skin at least so
[2002.48 - 2008.08] there's a different alarm bells for that
[2005.92 - 2010.08] but when it goes into a needle and
[2008.08 - 2011.68] passes everything and goes into the
[2010.08 - 2014.40] muscle past the derm and now it's a
[2011.68 - 2014.40] whole nother game
[2015.04 - 2019.44] yeah and so people can have people can
[2018.48 - 2022.16] have
[2019.44 - 2023.20] anaphylactic shock with the b stick but
[2022.16 - 2024.64] bee sting
[2023.20 - 2026.72] similar to that because it's coming from
[2024.64 - 2028.72] the outside a lot of people their body
[2026.72 - 2031.52] doesn't like that
[2028.72 - 2032.96] so i tell people it's like with the b12
[2031.52 - 2036.00] shots
[2032.96 - 2038.16] really important antibiotic shots as
[2036.00 - 2039.84] well i tell doctors all the time
[2038.16 - 2041.76] do if you're gonna if you're gonna
[2039.84 - 2044.56] prescribe i tell doctors all the time
[2041.76 - 2046.88] if you're gonna prescribe an antibiotic
[2044.56 - 2049.92] to your patients
[2046.88 - 2052.64] prescribe it orally don't
[2049.92 - 2054.00] do a needle i'm not talking about
[2052.64 - 2055.12] intravenous i'm talking about a needle
[2054.00 - 2058.16] into the arm
[2055.12 - 2060.96] into the butt the butt muscle
[2058.16 - 2062.16] glorio the you know into the glute i'm
[2060.96 - 2064.64] not talking about
[2062.16 - 2065.92] that way right i'm not i'm talking about
[2064.64 - 2068.56] that way not into the
[2065.92 - 2068.96] intravenously so what happens is when
[2068.56 - 2070.96] because
[2068.96 - 2072.72] antibiotics when they're driven into you
[2070.96 - 2074.56] like that by a needle your body's gonna
[2072.72 - 2076.32] they eventually build some type of
[2074.56 - 2078.08] antibody towards an antibiotic and now
[2076.32 - 2079.28] you're not gonna be able to handle
[2078.08 - 2081.04] you're not gonna be able to handle
[2079.28 - 2082.96] penicillin you're gonna be allergic to
[2081.04 - 2084.88] penicillin
[2082.96 - 2086.64] a lot of reasons why people are allergic
[2084.88 - 2087.44] to penicillin is because penicillin was
[2086.64 - 2090.88] injected
[2087.44 - 2093.76] through a needle through their arm or
[2090.88 - 2095.28] through a needle on their behind and
[2093.76 - 2098.00] that's why they become allergic to
[2095.28 - 2098.00] penicillin
[2098.32 - 2103.44] yeah all these things matter if you're
[2101.36 - 2106.72] allergic to shellfish that means somehow
[2103.44 - 2107.20] shellfish entered into your body the
[2106.72 - 2112.08] wrong
[2107.20 - 2114.24] way or a component or a
[2112.08 - 2117.28] compound of shellfish entered into your
[2114.24 - 2120.88] body the wrong way
[2117.28 - 2121.36] somewhere along the line there's there's
[2120.88 - 2122.96] there's
[2121.36 - 2124.96] there's reasons why we have that
[2122.96 - 2127.76] anaphylaxis shock or that serious
[2124.96 - 2131.12] serious hive issue or hives
[2127.76 - 2132.72] too part of it is because their liver is
[2131.12 - 2134.72] all sluggish and stagnant everybody's
[2132.72 - 2136.64] liver is sluggish and stagnant and just
[2134.72 - 2137.76] completely congested with all this
[2136.64 - 2140.16] garbage and junk
[2137.76 - 2142.00] just filled with tons of stuff filled
[2140.16 - 2143.68] with all kinds of things
[2142.00 - 2145.52] and that's where the hive part comes
[2143.68 - 2147.04] into play the hives
[2145.52 - 2149.44] the hives come into play because the
[2147.04 - 2151.76] liver is so stagnant and sluggish and so
[2149.44 - 2154.32] gunked up and when it's that gunked up
[2151.76 - 2157.36] and that's sluggish and not stagnant
[2154.32 - 2159.20] then we get in trouble we get in trouble
[2157.36 - 2161.12] that means all you have to do is start
[2159.20 - 2162.40] exercising a little bit and boom that
[2161.12 - 2163.92] blood rushing through that liver is
[2162.40 - 2164.40] going to bring out all that gunk and now
[2163.92 - 2167.84] you're going to be
[2164.40 - 2167.84] hived up every other day
[2167.92 - 2171.20] you can get hives easily just just
[2169.60 - 2172.00] eating anything because you eat
[2171.20 - 2173.68] something too
[2172.00 - 2175.92] that's flushing the liver a little bit
[2173.68 - 2177.84] you get hives that way too
[2175.92 - 2179.76] the hives are really a difficult one
[2177.84 - 2181.20] sometimes easy to fix once you clean up
[2179.76 - 2182.72] your liver and you get past them for a
[2181.20 - 2186.16] while it's easy to fix
[2182.72 - 2187.68] medical medium style for sure
[2186.16 - 2189.60] constance you caught the live let's

[2237.76 - 2244.16] raquel s i'd love to see anthony

[2244.16 - 2248.08] doctor can
[2245.84 - 2250.88] that's a funny one to me i'm scratching
[2248.08 - 2250.88] my head on that
[2252.16 - 2255.52] because i had a 24-hour hotline for
[2254.48 - 2256.88] years
[2255.52 - 2259.20] what were you doing when i wasn't
[2256.88 - 2261.28] sleeping for all those years
[2259.20 - 2263.28] you know i mean i'm i'm sure that's like
[2261.28 - 2264.56] that's you know a compliment in your
[2263.28 - 2266.56] and you're being nice about it and
[2264.56 - 2268.16] that's not that's not a insult or
[2266.56 - 2269.68] anything but check this out right
[2268.16 - 2271.60] does this help though with that a little
[2269.68 - 2275.04] bit i had a 24
[2271.60 - 2276.80] hour hotline hardly slept a wink
[2275.04 - 2278.40] you know what my emergency hotline was
[2276.80 - 2280.08] for it was for doctors and their
[2278.40 - 2281.92] patients
[2280.08 - 2283.28] so i had doctors waking me up all night
[2281.92 - 2285.52] long for years
[2283.28 - 2287.04] and years with emergencies with their
[2285.52 - 2289.76] patients
[2287.04 - 2290.24] and that's what my life was like and my
[2289.76 - 2292.56] life
[2290.24 - 2294.56] isn't much better than that now it's
[2292.56 - 2295.76] just a little better where i do sleep
[2294.56 - 2298.16] more
[2295.76 - 2299.84] because you know i'm not i i don't sleep
[2298.16 - 2300.80] as much because i'm working 20 hours a
[2299.84 - 2303.92] day now
[2300.80 - 2304.72] before i was working you know 15 18
[2303.92 - 2306.32] hours a day
[2304.72 - 2307.84] and then up throughout the night with
[2306.32 - 2312.48] calls all the time
[2307.84 - 2315.04] so i had the 24-hour hotline for years
[2312.48 - 2316.32] years you know the beepers do you guys
[2315.04 - 2319.12] know little beepers
[2316.32 - 2320.56] the beavers you'd have on right the
[2319.12 - 2324.16] beavers you'd have on
[2320.56 - 2325.04] they beep yeah i had one of those by my
[2324.16 - 2327.84] bed
[2325.04 - 2329.68] right by my head right there and doctors
[2327.84 - 2332.08] all had the number
[2329.68 - 2333.60] every single night and i still get
[2332.08 - 2334.80] people calling me with emergencies all
[2333.60 - 2338.80] the time
[2334.80 - 2340.00] all the time i do and i still help out
[2338.80 - 2342.24] some people i still i
[2340.00 - 2344.24] do still help out some people some of
[2342.24 - 2346.56] the most powerful people in the world
[2344.24 - 2347.84] because what what the only reason why i
[2346.56 - 2348.24] do that people say well why would you
[2347.84 - 2349.60] help
[2348.24 - 2352.48] some of the most powerful people in the
[2349.60 - 2356.00] world why would you do that
[2352.48 - 2359.52] like what would that matter it's because
[2356.00 - 2362.08] it's a way to also reach more people
[2359.52 - 2362.88] reach more people so we can heal the
[2362.08 - 2364.88] world
[2362.88 - 2366.08] it's critical that there's some
[2364.88 - 2368.88] something like that
[2366.08 - 2369.36] you know out there i don't i don't have
[2368.88 - 2371.36] pr
[2369.36 - 2373.68] and marketing i don't i'm not like the
[2371.36 - 2375.44] podcast doctors they spend 500 000 a
[2373.68 - 2377.04] month a million dollars a month
[2375.44 - 2378.88] so people can listen to podcasts and buy
[2377.04 - 2380.00] their products i don't have that going
[2378.88 - 2382.56] on
[2380.00 - 2384.08] so none of that happens here so that's
[2382.56 - 2387.12] critical to know
[2384.08 - 2388.48] and so you know my reach even though
[2387.12 - 2390.48] millions of books have gotten out there
[2388.48 - 2391.92] thank god because of the publisher
[2390.48 - 2393.52] millions of books have gotten out there
[2391.92 - 2394.08] in the world and have been the number
[2393.52 - 2396.64] one health
[2394.08 - 2397.68] author for six years running even with
[2396.64 - 2399.20] all that
[2397.68 - 2400.80] still i don't hire all the pr and
[2399.20 - 2403.04] marketing and all that stuff
[2400.80 - 2404.56] to do the reach so i do help out some of
[2403.04 - 2405.36] the most powerful people in the world
[2404.56 - 2407.28] though
[2405.36 - 2408.84] because i've been helping them out for
[2407.28 - 2412.64] 30 years
[2408.84 - 2415.44] um yes does yes does help doctors
[2412.64 - 2416.72] i met a doctor who consulted with aw and
[2415.44 - 2419.68] this is totally true
[2416.72 - 2420.96] in case you're here to doubt and be an
[2419.68 - 2424.24] ass
[2420.96 - 2426.96] angela thanks i appreciate it
[2424.24 - 2428.56] and so yeah so how does aw handle
[2426.96 - 2430.40] emergencies
[2428.56 - 2431.92] well give you kind of a window what the
[2430.40 - 2434.08] hotline used to be
[2431.92 - 2434.96] okay let me go back a little earlier
[2434.08 - 2436.64] real
[2434.96 - 2438.64] real quick too which is important if you
[2436.64 - 2442.80] guys want a window okay
[2438.64 - 2443.76] let's go back to 19 to say any of 1993
[2442.80 - 2446.00] i'd say
[2443.76 - 2447.28] there's a knock on my door it's two
[2446.00 - 2449.20] o'clock in the morning
[2447.28 - 2451.52] and a mom is holding a baby with a fever
[2449.20 - 2453.92] of 105.
[2451.52 - 2456.32] how about that happened on a regular
[2453.92 - 2456.32] basis
[2456.56 - 2460.72] so how does aw handle emergencies okay
[2459.44 - 2465.36] the hotline rings
[2460.72 - 2466.72] and beeps and someone's in the hospital
[2465.36 - 2468.72] and the doctors don't know if they're
[2466.72 - 2470.48] about to do an appendicitis for
[2468.72 - 2472.48] you know if they're the appendix removal
[2470.48 - 2475.52] because of an appendicitis issue
[2472.48 - 2476.96] right or it's severe food poisoning and
[2475.52 - 2478.48] i have to talk to the doctor to give the
[2476.96 - 2481.28] decision to the doctors the doctor can
[2478.48 - 2483.12] make a decision for the surgeon
[2481.28 - 2485.20] how about that for emergencies and it's
[2483.12 - 2488.56] a four-year-old
[2485.20 - 2490.32] all the time this happened all the time
[2488.56 - 2492.32] i worked with doctors all the time and
[2490.32 - 2495.84] that happened so how does
[2492.32 - 2495.84] aw do it
[2497.28 - 2502.08] okay so we're looking good here
[2500.56 - 2503.76] so what i'm going to do is i think i'm
[2502.08 - 2506.80] going to go with
[2503.76 - 2509.04] some lime in these so i don't know how
[2506.80 - 2511.36] you guys feel but these normals
[2509.04 - 2512.80] i'm gonna go with some lime so what i do
[2511.36 - 2517.84] is i wet
[2512.80 - 2520.96] the sheet like this
[2517.84 - 2522.16] with a little bit of lime juice right
[2520.96 - 2524.32] and now i'm going to put some
[2522.16 - 2527.04] cauliflower rice in here look at that
[2524.32 - 2528.96] this is a raw cauliflower rice it's it's
[2527.04 - 2531.52] a raw meal
[2528.96 - 2532.08] it's light it's delicious now i don't
[2531.52 - 2534.08] want to put
[2532.08 - 2535.28] too much i just put too much rice in
[2534.08 - 2537.60] there
[2535.28 - 2539.20] right so this one's gonna be a fat one
[2537.60 - 2540.48] and i don't i don't like sometimes when
[2539.20 - 2542.96] the rolls are that fat
[2540.48 - 2544.80] i cut some scallions up so that they're
[2542.96 - 2546.08] not too crazy i'm gonna put one across
[2544.80 - 2548.08] here one across here what do you guys
[2546.08 - 2552.00] think
[2548.08 - 2554.72] how's this look right i love these green
[2552.00 - 2556.64] scallions these green onions i love them
[2554.72 - 2559.12] when they're like this
[2556.64 - 2561.52] let's do this now let's get a little bit
[2559.12 - 2562.80] of dulce in here now the dulce isn't
[2561.52 - 2565.84] moist
[2562.80 - 2567.44] so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna run a
[2565.84 - 2569.52] little bit of water in here
[2567.44 - 2571.92] like this a little touch of water and
[2569.52 - 2575.12] i'm gonna moisten
[2571.92 - 2577.60] the dolls okay
[2575.12 - 2578.24] not get it too wet not get it too crazy
[2577.60 - 2580.80] wet
[2578.24 - 2581.52] so that's a goal i love when i have wild
[2580.80 - 2585.04] foods
[2581.52 - 2587.12] in my in my dish whenever you have a
[2585.04 - 2591.04] wild food in here it's like hey
[2587.12 - 2591.04] that's a big deal remember that
[2591.52 - 2596.24] okay so let's get a little dulce in here
[2593.92 - 2598.96] you don't need a lot
[2596.24 - 2600.24] just a little bit that that might be
[2598.96 - 2601.68] probably a lot for somebody
[2600.24 - 2603.60] i'm gonna be like whoa that's a lot of

[2629.12 - 2632.00] guys should take advantage of the sale
[2630.40 - 2635.84] or get a free the library
[2632.00 - 2635.84] amazon controls the prices not me
[2636.00 - 2641.04] so let's put a little tomato
[2639.12 - 2642.16] in here so i'm slicing up some tomato
[2641.04 - 2646.24] right here
[2642.16 - 2648.24] okay should i be afraid of this tomato
[2646.24 - 2651.92] so what you guys so some of you guys are
[2648.24 - 2655.20] telling me i should be afraid of it
[2651.92 - 2657.28] don't be afraid of a tomato
[2655.20 - 2658.64] there's pandemic information in this
[2657.28 - 2661.28] book by the way
[2658.64 - 2662.72] pandemic information in this book it's
[2661.28 - 2665.28] mind-blowing
[2662.72 - 2666.64] and it's the original information it was
[2665.28 - 2668.16] taken originally it's published here
[2666.64 - 2669.20] first but was taken here and used
[2668.16 - 2670.96] recently
[2669.20 - 2672.56] by a couple different doctors so they
[2670.96 - 2674.08] took it from medical medium didn't cite
[2672.56 - 2675.84] back medical medium and they're
[2674.08 - 2677.44] using my pandemic information that was
[2675.84 - 2679.20] published first isn't that incredible
[2677.44 - 2682.40] though when you think about that
[2679.20 - 2683.68] what do you think about that you know
[2682.40 - 2685.92] discrimination
[2683.68 - 2687.04] there's a lot of doctors that do cite me
[2685.92 - 2688.32] all the time and there's doctors that
[2687.04 - 2689.36] use the medical mean books in their
[2688.32 - 2690.88] practices
[2689.36 - 2692.56] but when you don't cite me it's just
[2690.88 - 2693.04] it's just spiritual discrimination it's
[2692.56 - 2695.20] also
[2693.04 - 2697.12] greed because you're so hungry for new
[2695.20 - 2699.36] thought and new ideas
[2697.12 - 2701.60] so hungry that you think you can rob and
[2699.36 - 2703.28] steal
[2701.60 - 2705.52] and then you know because you get this
[2703.28 - 2708.08] just they're so hungry for
[2705.52 - 2708.56] new stuff so just take it from the mm
[2708.08 - 2710.96] and don't
[2708.56 - 2712.48] cite them it's just like who does who
[2710.96 - 2714.16] would do that right
[2712.48 - 2717.52] talk about integrity let's put a little
[2714.16 - 2720.00] bit of cilantro in here
[2717.52 - 2722.32] check this out you guys cilantro's a
[2720.00 - 2726.88] leafy green
[2722.32 - 2728.88] it's an herb but use it as a leafy green
[2726.88 - 2731.76] okay now i'm going to add a little spice
[2728.88 - 2736.00] to this the spice isn't raw
[2731.76 - 2737.60] it's it's obviously not it's spice right

[2837.28 - 2841.68] around
[2838.56 - 2843.04] in frog land you can play around in frog
[2841.68 - 2844.96] land
[2843.04 - 2846.64] there's a ton of frauds out there tons
[2844.96 - 2848.24] of them you can play in that land all
[2846.64 - 2848.56] day long you can do your fish oil and
[2848.24 - 2851.44] your
[2848.56 - 2851.76] charcoal and you can do your you know
[2851.44 - 2853.52] your
[2851.76 - 2855.28] oil pulling and waste 20 minutes every
[2853.52 - 2857.20] single day doing your oil pulling
[2855.28 - 2859.12] which encapsulates the bacteria in your
[2857.20 - 2859.52] teeth and gums which is disastrous you
[2859.12 - 2861.68] can
[2859.52 - 2863.44] play around in fraud land do your
[2861.68 - 2864.56] kombucha tea which turns your blood into
[2863.44 - 2866.64] acid
[2864.56 - 2868.16] fraud land you can play around with
[2866.64 - 2868.96] fraud land all you want if you're not so
[2868.16 - 2870.40] sick
[2868.96 - 2872.08] you'll probably improve because you'll
[2870.40 - 2873.76] actually be cleaning up stuff not eating
[2872.08 - 2876.16] junk food anymore
[2873.76 - 2878.00] not eating fast food anymore you can be
[2876.16 - 2880.32] putting your cacao in your shakes
[2878.00 - 2881.68] fraud land again drug dealers want you
[2880.32 - 2883.68] to put cacao in your shakes
[2881.68 - 2885.76] like you can play if you're not so sick
[2883.68 - 2888.56] or not sick you get sick
[2885.76 - 2889.60] you gotta learn the details matter you
[2888.56 - 2891.04] gotta learn
[2889.60 - 2892.48] you gotta learn all right that's a
[2891.04 - 2895.12] beautiful nori roll right there let me
[2892.48 - 2898.48] put it put it aside for now
[2895.12 - 2901.60] let's make another one let's do it again
[2898.48 - 2904.56] so i'm gonna put instead of lime
[2901.60 - 2906.08] as the juicing this up i'm gonna put a
[2904.56 - 2908.32] little bit of tomato
[2906.08 - 2909.36] juice on here from the fresh tomato
[2908.32 - 2912.56] check that out
[2909.36 - 2915.44] let's get some more cauliflower let's
[2912.56 - 2917.28] make another one
[2915.44 - 2918.80] don't use too much cauliflower rice you
[2917.28 - 2920.16] don't need to use that much rice because
[2918.80 - 2922.96] we're putting a lot of other stuff in
[2920.16 - 2926.00] here keep that in mind
[2922.96 - 2928.64] real sushi
[2926.00 - 2930.88] everybody thinks they they're so proud
[2928.64 - 2932.00] of themselves when they do the sushi out
[2930.88 - 2934.00] there right
[2932.00 - 2937.68] so everybody thinks they're so so proud
[2934.00 - 2937.68] of themselves i see it all the time
[2938.16 - 2942.48] so when you do your real sushi you got
[2941.04 - 2946.64] your
[2942.48 - 2948.24] tuna right it's your rice your tuna
[2946.64 - 2949.76] you got all of that there you got your
[2948.24 - 2952.88] wasabi
[2949.76 - 2954.40] got your pickled ginger so you got your
[2952.88 - 2954.80] little plate you got your sushi plate
[2954.40 - 2957.04] right
[2954.80 - 2958.32] so people are taught right now to think
[2957.04 - 2960.00] that's eating healthy
[2958.32 - 2962.16] and you'll see people out there like i
[2960.00 - 2964.72] had sushi i eat sushi three times a week
[2962.16 - 2968.00] that's really healthy
[2964.72 - 2969.68] but sushi's not healthy so what happens
[2968.00 - 2971.60] is with sushi
[2969.68 - 2973.28] is you get all that mercury you got that
[2971.60 - 2974.88] and you got all that vinegar and you got
[2973.28 - 2975.92] all that bad sugar and you got all the
[2974.88 - 2978.00] dioxins
[2975.92 - 2980.64] so when you put that all together this
[2978.00 - 2982.16] is not a health food this is disastrous
[2980.64 - 2983.76] but when you're not so sick you can play
[2982.16 - 2985.12] in sushi land i guess all you want until
[2983.76 - 2987.60] you get food poisoning
[2985.12 - 2990.00] eating you know your sushi one day and
[2987.60 - 2993.52] you're barfing for three days
[2990.00 - 2995.12] and you're just sick but what happens is
[2993.52 - 2996.72] the people don't realize it but here's
[2995.12 - 2998.40] another mistake it's like sushi so but
[2996.72 - 2999.68] people are taught that it must be
[2998.40 - 3002.00] healthy it's a healthy
[2999.68 - 3003.28] alternative you know and here's what's a
[3002.00 - 3005.44] funny thing hey i don't get
[3003.28 - 3007.84] i hear this all the time i don't get the
[3005.44 - 3010.80] traditional sushi at the sushi bar
[3007.84 - 3012.00] i get the vegan vegetarian sushi they
[3010.80 - 3014.00] don't use any fish
[3012.00 - 3015.04] in there they put avocado in there they
[3014.00 - 3017.36] put all this
[3015.04 - 3019.20] cool stuff they put watercress in there
[3017.36 - 3021.20] it's all vinegar
[3019.20 - 3022.40] it's all vinegar just turning your blood
[3021.20 - 3025.68] into acid
[3022.40 - 3027.20] that's what it is it's all vinegar
[3025.68 - 3029.28] so i just put some rice in here
[3027.20 - 3031.28] cauliflower rice this is great
[3029.28 - 3032.64] let's cut another scallion because these
[3031.28 - 3034.32] are so fat
[3032.64 - 3036.48] these are really big scallions they're
[3034.32 - 3038.16] thick so i'm going to flip it like this
[3036.48 - 3040.00] one on that side right here one on this
[3038.16 - 3043.04] side check that out you guys
[3040.00 - 3044.64] okay all right let's put a little bit
[3043.04 - 3047.36] more adults in here
[3044.64 - 3047.36] look at that
[3048.16 - 3051.44] isn't that great little dolls right
[3049.76 - 3055.04] across the
[3051.44 - 3057.12] the back of that this is fun today
[3055.04 - 3058.16] but you can play in the fraud land is
[3057.12 - 3060.32] what i call it
[3058.16 - 3062.24] it's what i call it you can be doing
[3060.32 - 3064.00] your fish oil your corella you can do
[3062.24 - 3065.76] your diatomaceous earth particles which
[3064.00 - 3068.48] should just kill you
[3065.76 - 3070.56] stuff is so bad for you all this you can
[3068.48 - 3072.48] do your corella i think i said that over
[3070.56 - 3076.24] and over again you can do
[3072.48 - 3076.88] you can do your colostrum your collagen
[3076.24 - 3079.60] which is just
[3076.88 - 3081.04] it's fraud land it's all fraudulent
[3079.60 - 3083.52] stuff
[3081.04 - 3085.04] and there's more more i mean i'm just
[3083.52 - 3087.04] naming the few basics
[3085.04 - 3089.12] right there's tons of do your protein
[3087.04 - 3091.28] powders which has all this msg in it all
[3089.12 - 3094.24] this garbage and msg
[3091.28 - 3094.24] fraud land again
[3094.32 - 3097.60] but you know what keeps all the stuff
[3095.68 - 3098.88] around you know why medical medium can't
[3097.60 - 3101.04] crush this stuff
[3098.88 - 3102.08] he tries but he can't crush it third
[3101.04 - 3104.16] person
[3102.08 - 3106.16] you know why is because they're putting
[3104.16 - 3107.52] millions of dollars of ads out on all
[3106.16 - 3110.32] this stuff
[3107.52 - 3111.92] over and over and over again and as
[3110.32 - 3114.48] people get a little sick
[3111.92 - 3117.12] not so sick not so crazy sick they're
[3114.48 - 3119.68] just jumping into it
[3117.12 - 3120.72] fermented foods are not a health food i
[3119.68 - 3124.08] hate to break it
[3120.72 - 3125.44] to you guys it's not a health food it
[3124.08 - 3126.72] was never a health food it was a
[3125.44 - 3129.12] survival food
[3126.72 - 3130.24] and if i was if this was 2 000 years ago
[3129.12 - 3131.60] when i was in china
[3130.24 - 3133.60] you better believe i would take
[3131.60 - 3136.96] everything out of my garden
[3133.60 - 3139.76] before the before the freeze came
[3136.96 - 3140.24] and i would throw it into a big vat a
[3139.76 - 3144.08] big
[3140.24 - 3147.12] ceramic clay vat shut the lid on it
[3144.08 - 3148.64] and let it turn to mush that's what
[3147.12 - 3150.64] that's and let it ferment
[3148.64 - 3152.40] you know why they did that they had no
[3150.64 - 3153.76] refrigeration no freezers they had no
[3152.40 - 3156.96] food stuff and they had nobody
[3153.76 - 3157.60] no food stores you right when the season
[3156.96 - 3160.00] ended
[3157.60 - 3161.44] you live or die that's what it was like
[3160.00 - 3162.08] everywhere around the world not just
[3161.44 - 3164.80] china
[3162.08 - 3166.16] everywhere around the world that's what
[3164.80 - 3169.04] it was like
[3166.16 - 3170.72] but we always say it's ancient it's it's
[3169.04 - 3172.48] a health food no it wasn't it was like
[3170.72 - 3173.92] live or die
[3172.48 - 3175.92] so that's what they did they took all
[3173.92 - 3178.16] their fresh food by the end of the year
[3175.92 - 3180.32] that they had left and they stuck it in
[3178.16 - 3182.16] massive vats because guess what
[3180.32 - 3183.84] you would eat that fermented slop all
[3182.16 - 3185.44] winter long because it was the only way
[3183.84 - 3186.72] to stay alive until spring until you can
[3185.44 - 3189.52] get your new crops going
[3186.72 - 3191.12] it was a survival mechanism it wasn't a
[3189.52 - 3193.84] health food
[3191.12 - 3195.84] it was putrified and the bacteria that's
[3193.84 - 3199.52] involved with fermented food is
[3195.84 - 3200.88] is bacteria that lives on death
[3199.52 - 3202.32] did you know that all the bacteria
[3200.88 - 3204.08] that's on fermented food isn't the kind
[3202.32 - 3204.80] your body normally has or naturally has
[3204.08 - 3206.24] it all
[3204.80 - 3207.52] did you know the good bacteria inside
[3206.24 - 3209.04] our body has nothing to do with any of
[3207.52 - 3210.80] that fermented stuff that's not the back
[3209.04 - 3212.64] the bacteria in fermented foods bacteria
[3210.80 - 3214.40] that comes when something dies
[3212.64 - 3215.76] when an animal dies in the woods it gets
[3214.40 - 3218.96] engulfed by bacteria
[3215.76 - 3218.96] bacteria of death
[3219.44 - 3223.20] if you want to ferment a vegetable or
[3221.44 - 3224.72] anything ferment anything or ferment
[3223.20 - 3227.44] fish or ferment anything
[3224.72 - 3230.40] you what happens is it's bacteria that
[3227.44 - 3230.40] rides on death
[3230.48 - 3235.60] right so when they do hanging meats this
[3234.08 - 3237.20] is medical medium info so you know when
[3235.60 - 3239.92] they do hanging meats
[3237.20 - 3241.12] when they hang meat what is what is the
[3239.92 - 3243.44] ham they hang
[3241.12 - 3245.04] is the pork they hang right was it
[3243.44 - 3246.56] pancetta or is it something else what is
[3245.04 - 3250.24] it you guys i can't remember
[3246.56 - 3253.44] you hang you hang meat and you age it
[3250.24 - 3257.20] the bacteria on that meat got bacteria
[3253.44 - 3258.88] that's death but none of this bacteria
[3257.20 - 3261.60] that's on death of any kind
[3258.88 - 3262.88] bacteria on kimchi is death none of that
[3261.60 - 3265.28] bacteria
[3262.88 - 3267.44] is naturally inside our bodies ever so
[3265.28 - 3268.80] when you eat that fermented food you
[3267.44 - 3270.56] think that's camping out
[3268.80 - 3272.72] that bacteria doesn't camp out inside of
[3270.56 - 3275.12] you that's all bacteria that dies from
[3272.72 - 3276.00] your hcl your hcl just kills it fast
[3275.12 - 3280.96] because it's
[3276.00 - 3280.96] the wrong kind the wrong kind
[3283.84 - 3287.44] i know you guys right i'm told every day
[3285.68 - 3288.08] why don't you make programs disappear
[3287.44 - 3290.08] for a year
[3288.08 - 3291.44] show up again make programs sell them
[3290.08 - 3292.88] for three thousand dollars a piece the
[3291.44 - 3293.76] amount of information you give for free
[3292.88 - 3295.52] is endless
[3293.76 - 3297.04] endless and no one even has information
[3295.52 - 3297.92] to give you like that so
[3297.04 - 3299.44] and they're just stealing your
[3297.92 - 3300.08] information and charging everybody for
[3299.44 - 3301.68] it anyway
[3300.08 - 3302.88] all the potty has doctors everybody else
[3301.68 - 3304.16] they're all stealing your information
[3302.88 - 3305.52] and charging for it
[3304.16 - 3306.88] everybody's stealing medical medium
[3305.52 - 3308.24] information and charging for it why
[3306.88 - 3310.64] don't you do the 3 000
[3308.24 - 3311.36] programs you can be rich in no time
[3310.64 - 3312.72] you'll be all
[3311.36 - 3314.00] everything will be great and people will
[3312.72 - 3314.56] wait for it and they'll want to do it
[3314.00 - 3316.72] because
[3314.56 - 3319.04] they will you'll get just you know
[3316.72 - 3323.04] plenty of people
[3319.04 - 3326.48] i can't do that to you guys i can't
[3323.04 - 3326.48] let's put a little tomato on here
[3332.84 - 3337.68] so
[3335.28 - 3340.16] derek says derek amber says my
[3337.68 - 3342.16] autoimmune doctor told me to get rid of
[3340.16 - 3345.28] eggs because i have ebv
[3342.16 - 3347.92] do you agree derek
[3345.28 - 3350.56] that's medical medium information didn't
[3347.92 - 3350.56] he cite me
[3352.32 - 3357.36] so he didn't say medical medium that's
[3354.80 - 3359.36] medical medium published information
[3357.36 - 3363.52] my autoimmune doctor told me to get rid
[3359.36 - 3368.72] of eggs because i have ebv do you agree
[3363.52 - 3370.80] well look i agree with your doctor's
[3368.72 - 3372.08] advice your that's your doctor giving
[3370.80 - 3374.40] you advice
[3372.08 - 3375.92] so i i can't give you advice like that
[3374.40 - 3378.00] because your doctors he's giving he's
[3375.92 - 3382.00] your doctor he's giving you advice
[3378.00 - 3384.56] right and but i can tell you
[3382.00 - 3386.08] that that advice he's giving is medical
[3384.56 - 3388.16] medium information
[3386.08 - 3389.20] that's what that is it's medical medium
[3388.16 - 3392.64] information
[3389.20 - 3395.20] and pretty cool but uncool
[3392.64 - 3396.72] uncool ask him where he got it he might
[3395.20 - 3397.68] not have gotten it for a medical meeting
[3396.72 - 3399.60] he might have gotten it from another
[3397.68 - 3403.20] doctor that got it for medical mediums
[3399.60 - 3406.00] i'm gonna roll this up but first of all
[3403.20 - 3408.08] epstein-barr feeds off of eggs there's
[3406.00 - 3409.92] no scientific study that shows that
[3408.08 - 3412.32] so your doctor's not using science on
[3409.92 - 3414.72] any level so your doctor is not using a
[3412.32 - 3416.24] scientific study he's not using a study
[3414.72 - 3418.32] from the mayo clinic or
[3416.24 - 3420.32] study from john hopkins he's not using a
[3418.32 - 3422.32] study stolen kettering he's not using a
[3420.32 - 3423.92] study from anywhere
[3422.32 - 3425.36] he's not the cleveland clinic there's no
[3423.92 - 3426.56] study there's no study anywhere he's
[3425.36 - 3428.32] using medical media published
[3426.56 - 3428.88] information it's only place that comes
[3428.32 - 3430.72] from this
[3428.88 - 3432.40] and there's no scientific study for it
[3430.72 - 3434.96] at all eggs
[3432.40 - 3436.88] feed viruses viruses such as
[3434.96 - 3437.68] epstein-barr the epstein-barr feeds off
[3436.88 - 3441.28] of eggs
[3437.68 - 3444.56] that is mm-info
[3441.28 - 3444.56] i'm honored you're here by the way
[3445.76 - 3449.68] epstein-barr being a problem with any
[3447.92 - 3451.84] kind of autoimmune is medical medium
[3449.68 - 3455.04] information not just the egg part
[3451.84 - 3455.76] so what i suggest is you show the doctor
[3455.04 - 3457.76] this book
[3455.76 - 3459.12] bring the doctor this book and tell them
[3457.76 - 3461.68] where it all stems from
[3459.12 - 3462.40] published here first medical medium new
[3461.68 - 3464.72] edition
[3462.40 - 3466.08] revised expanded it was published in the
[3464.72 - 3467.76] original medical medium book
[3466.08 - 3469.60] so i would advise you bring the book to
[3467.76 - 3471.20] your doctor and you tell them a medium
[3469.60 - 3474.24] came out that information and it's not a
[3471.20 - 3476.00] scientific study
[3474.24 - 3478.80] that's what i would do the other thing
[3476.00 - 3482.88] too the other the other thing too
[3478.80 - 3484.48] okay is that autoimmune in general
[3482.88 - 3486.24] and problems with autoimmune caused by
[3484.48 - 3488.40] epstein-barr is medical medium-published
[3486.24 - 3490.56] information as well
[3488.40 - 3492.56] there's layers of just mm info all in
[3490.56 - 3494.24] that wrapped up in there
[3492.56 - 3495.68] so we got two nice no re rolls let's
[3494.24 - 3502.56] make a sauce
[3495.68 - 3505.60] let's do that
[3502.56 - 3507.20] you think i would be happy about it but
[3505.60 - 3508.80] how's someone get going to get the
[3507.20 - 3511.28] complete story and all the details that
[3508.80 - 3513.68] matter so they can heal their ebv
[3511.28 - 3515.12] when they're only they're only throwing
[3513.68 - 3515.76] out tidbits that come from medical
[3515.12 - 3517.44] medium
[3515.76 - 3519.20] the sighting's critical so you can get
[3517.44 - 3521.04] the full story so you can heal
[3519.20 - 3522.72] but i guess that doesn't matter if a mom
[3521.04 - 3524.80] out there is sick with epstein-barr
[3522.72 - 3527.36] doesn't get the full story she's just
[3524.80 - 3528.88] debilitatingly sick she's disabled she's
[3527.36 - 3530.72] in bed now she can't feed her kids
[3528.88 - 3531.92] anymore she loses her job her husband's
[3530.72 - 3534.56] doing everything
[3531.92 - 3536.24] he's freaking out he's he's just you
[3534.56 - 3537.76] know can't handle it anymore
[3536.24 - 3539.52] the family's falling apart the little
[3537.76 - 3540.32] kids are being wounded forever because
[3539.52 - 3543.36] of it
[3540.32 - 3544.64] and the doctor doesn't want to give that
[3543.36 - 3546.88] mom
[3544.64 - 3548.32] where all the information comes from so
[3546.88 - 3549.52] she can actually heal her epstein-barr
[3548.32 - 3550.80] get her life together instead they'll
[3549.52 - 3553.36] give her fragments and then
[3550.80 - 3554.32] offer fish oil and some corella and some
[3553.36 - 3556.48] other things too
[3554.32 - 3558.32] which aren't medical medium and she'll
[3556.48 - 3559.84] stay sick and the kids will be miserable
[3558.32 - 3561.12] the family would be miserable and that's
[3559.84 - 3562.64] where it goes now do you see why
[3561.12 - 3563.20] sighting is so important or did i just
[3562.64 - 3564.80] did i miss
[3563.20 - 3567.68] did i miss something there or is
[3564.80 - 3567.68] exciting important

[3650.24 - 3653.60] are you guys cool if i use honey are you
[3652.08 - 3655.68] all right from honey if you're if you're
[3653.60 - 3657.44] into the whole thing where honey's bad
[3655.68 - 3658.80] if you're a vegan or plant-based or you
[3657.44 - 3660.64] can't eat consume
[3658.80 - 3662.08] honey you know what's really crazy is
[3660.64 - 3662.88] you get the vegans and plant-based
[3662.08 - 3664.72] people who are
[3662.88 - 3666.32] really die-hard vegan right and i
[3664.72 - 3666.96] totally respect that totally but what
[3666.32 - 3668.48] happens is
[3666.96 - 3670.16] they get their teeth starts falling
[3668.48 - 3672.64] apart because they don't know
[3670.16 - 3674.00] other things they need and something
[3672.64 - 3675.76] goes wrong or they get their first
[3674.00 - 3677.20] symptoms or they get symptoms again
[3675.76 - 3678.80] after being vegan for a while and they
[3677.20 - 3680.32] freak out and here they were the person
[3678.80 - 3681.68] saying i can't have honey
[3680.32 - 3683.44] because it's from a bee and now they're
[3681.68 - 3685.04] eating eggs again because they because
[3683.44 - 3687.20] they've they freaked out and now they're
[3685.04 - 3687.68] eating eggs and dairy and raw dairy and
[3687.20 - 3689.20] eggs
[3687.68 - 3690.56] happens all the time meanwhile for the
[3689.20 - 3692.32] first two years of being a vegan they
[3690.56 - 3692.96] were ripping everybody apart for eating
[3692.32 - 3694.40] honey
[3692.96 - 3695.68] if you're a vegan eating honey if you're
[3694.40 - 3697.20] a vegan the next thing you know now
[3695.68 - 3699.84] they're eating eggs because they got
[3697.20 - 3699.84] sick
[3702.80 - 3707.20] here's the thing about if you're
[3705.92 - 3708.64] plant-based
[3707.20 - 3710.00] why i think it's okay for you to eat
[3708.64 - 3712.00] honey and you don't have to you can
[3710.00 - 3716.16] totally just do maple syrup i like maple
[3712.00 - 3716.16] syrup too but honey
[3716.48 - 3720.00] honey is it first of all a bee is not an
[3718.64 - 3722.96] animal
[3720.00 - 3724.32] critical to know a bee is not an animal
[3722.96 - 3727.84] it's one thing that's very important so
[3724.32 - 3727.84] i'm making a sauce
[3730.16 - 3735.92] a bee is an insect and a bee doesn't
[3733.36 - 3738.64] have a soul
[3735.92 - 3740.80] the all bees on the planet at once have
[3738.64 - 3742.80] a collective soul i know that's
[3740.80 - 3744.00] that for some people i get it you know
[3742.80 - 3745.12] some people that might be a little too
[3744.00 - 3747.12] much for them and they're like oh how
[3745.12 - 3750.32] can that be how's that possible like
[3747.12 - 3751.20] you know but that's what it is it's all
[3750.32 - 3755.04] bees have
[3751.20 - 3759.12] one soul lot of insects have
[3755.04 - 3762.40] one soul there's not an individual
[3759.12 - 3766.16] soul per ant there's
[3762.40 - 3770.00] the soul of all ant
[3766.16 - 3770.96] all ants kind instead of humankind all
[3770.00 - 3774.80] ant kind
[3770.96 - 3778.48] there's a soul for all the ants
[3774.80 - 3780.56] you can stomp out all like lots of ants
[3778.48 - 3782.88] can stomp them out they're still gonna
[3780.56 - 3786.00] have that one soul right
[3782.88 - 3788.64] it's different but a deer
[3786.00 - 3789.68] has an individual soul i know this might
[3788.64 - 3790.64] be a little too much for a lot of you
[3789.68 - 3792.56] guys i get it
[3790.64 - 3794.08] it's very spiritual some of you guys are
[3792.56 - 3795.36] like you know with that stuff it's just
[3794.08 - 3796.00] like you want to see the cooking or
[3795.36 - 3797.84] something and
[3796.00 - 3799.76] you don't want to go there a lot of you
[3797.84 - 3800.56] guys are really spiritual here of course
[3799.76 - 3804.80] i know that
[3800.56 - 3807.20] um okay so i got that in there
[3804.80 - 3808.72] let's put a little honey too making a
[3807.20 - 3810.80] nice sauce here now i'm gonna make this
[3808.72 - 3812.80] one hot
[3810.80 - 3816.72] let's throw a pepper in here let's do
[3812.80 - 3816.72] that this is a sweet hot pepper
[3818.72 - 3824.08] i'm not even going to dice it up
[3821.76 - 3825.92] it's going to do its thing just being in
[3824.08 - 3827.28] like little circles in here
[3825.92 - 3828.72] on tick tock you can see that right
[3827.28 - 3831.44] let's see if you can see this down low
[3828.72 - 3834.24] on youtube you see that there you go
[3831.44 - 3835.68] i think you can see it so let's put a
[3834.24 - 3839.20] little garlic in here too
[3835.68 - 3842.08] you don't need a lot of garlic
[3839.20 - 3842.56] i love garlic and i i do use a lot of it
[3842.08 - 3844.72] for
[3842.56 - 3847.04] you know many times but this i'm gonna
[3844.72 - 3849.52] not have this thing be so crazy
[3847.04 - 3852.24] i'm gonna just chop mince up one clove
[3849.52 - 3856.00] of garlic for the sauce
[3852.24 - 3857.04] boom and then i'm going to mix it up
[3856.00 - 3860.09] with a fork
[3857.04 - 3860.09] [Music]

[3909.04 - 3913.44] aw we're honored you show up for us over
[3911.68 - 3915.92] and over and over again

[3919.76 - 3924.64] might be together got the orange in here
[3922.48 - 3926.16] i got the hot pepper the garlic and the
[3924.64 - 3928.80] honey it's a simple one
[3926.16 - 3931.92] it's a basic one so let's cut up these
[3928.80 - 3931.92] two nori rolls
[3932.48 - 3936.80] now you guys have probably seen me do
[3934.24 - 3938.64] before sometimes i'll cut i'll have like
[3936.80 - 3940.32] six of these in a row and i'll i'll cut
[3938.64 - 3943.92] them on the board six in a row
[3940.32 - 3945.60] so i'm going to do just two now i'm not
[3943.92 - 3948.64] cutting real large pieces
[3945.60 - 3948.64] i'm cutting kind of
[3949.28 - 3952.80] i'd say three quarters of an inch
[3952.96 - 3956.80] is what i'm doing maybe yeah maybe three
[3955.84 - 3958.80] quarters of an inch
[3956.80 - 3960.48] somewhere around there right so i'm
[3958.80 - 3964.08] doing just doing that one's gonna cut it
[3960.48 - 3966.56] close over here so let me just do this
[3964.08 - 3967.92] i think i butchered one okay let me get
[3966.56 - 3971.12] a little plate out
[3967.92 - 3971.12] if you guys are cool with that
[3972.96 - 3975.92] let's plate these up
[3976.24 - 3979.76] now what happens if you don't cut good
[3977.84 - 3981.28] enough of course the uh
[3979.76 - 3982.88] nori is going to be connected it's going
[3981.28 - 3985.52] to be a hassle right
[3982.88 - 3986.40] so i'm going to put these ends in the
[3985.52 - 3989.20] middle
[3986.40 - 3989.20] that's what i'm going to do
[3991.68 - 3994.96] doing a sloppy job
[3996.32 - 3999.68] did that one even make it there putting
[3998.24 - 4001.92] the ends in the middle let me put these
[3999.68 - 4004.72] all around the edge here
[4001.92 - 4004.72] i'll show you guys
[4005.04 - 4008.88] hey there's no rules there's no rules

[4018.84 - 4023.52] overzealous
[4021.60 - 4025.12] that was overzealous when i was cutting
[4023.52 - 4026.64] them i was trying to be a little bit of
[4025.12 - 4029.68] a hot shot right there right
[4026.64 - 4029.68] cutting them too fast
[4030.72 - 4034.80] being sloppy there they go right there

[4038.40 - 4040.32] here
[4038.96 - 4042.40] now i'm kind of curious about this
[4040.32 - 4044.24] dipping sauce i don't know
[4042.40 - 4047.28] how hot this pepper is really going to
[4044.24 - 4049.84] be but let me just pop one in

[4089.04 - 4092.56] it looks great it's so healthy for you i
[4091.20 - 4093.84] mean if you really think about like
[4092.56 - 4096.40] what's in here i'm just letting you guys
[4093.84 - 4098.40] know if you think about what's in here
[4096.40 - 4100.80] okay you got anti-viral foods there's a
[4098.40 - 4103.20] sulfur compound in cauliflower
[4100.80 - 4104.08] that helps to stomp out viruses in your
[4103.20 - 4106.00] thyroid
[4104.08 - 4108.64] it's the opposite if you want to talk
[4106.00 - 4110.64] about one more silly thing real quick
[4108.64 - 4112.56] what about the goitrogen stuff right
[4110.64 - 4113.76] stay away from the kale and stay away
[4112.56 - 4115.28] from the cauliflower if you have a
[4113.76 - 4116.64] thyroid issue stay away from broccoli
[4115.28 - 4118.00] that's misinformation terrible
[4116.64 - 4120.16] misinformation another reason why
[4118.00 - 4122.16] people don't heal your thyroid
[4120.16 - 4125.68] desperately needs
[4122.16 - 4127.84] the cris cruciferous
[4125.68 - 4130.08] family it needs that it needs
[4127.84 - 4130.64] cruciferous it's critical that you have
[4130.08 - 4134.32] that
[4130.64 - 4136.00] that's a sulfur compound that you need
[4134.32 - 4137.92] it's so important so that's what
[4136.00 - 4141.64] saturates into the thyroid
[4137.92 - 4145.28] nodules tumors cysts thyroid cancer
[4141.64 - 4148.40] hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism graves
[4145.28 - 4150.24] hashimoto's thyroiditis all of those is
[4148.40 - 4153.84] because of epstein-barr viruses
[4150.24 - 4155.20] inside the thyroid and in order to help
[4153.84 - 4157.12] you need some broccoli you need some
[4155.20 - 4158.88] cauliflower you need these things it's
[4157.12 - 4160.88] really important
[4158.88 - 4162.40] important enough and then you got the
[4160.88 - 4165.36] dolls in there which is
[4162.40 - 4166.72] so highly mineralized so highly
[4165.36 - 4168.88] mineralized
[4166.72 - 4170.56] and it helps to take out toxic heavy
[4168.88 - 4172.32] metals out of the intestinal tract which
[4170.56 - 4174.56] is cool you got your cilantro
[4172.32 - 4176.32] which is a leafy green alkalizing but
[4174.56 - 4176.96] more than that trace mineral salts in
[4176.32 - 4178.72] that too
[4176.96 - 4180.16] plus chemical compounds to help with
[4178.72 - 4181.52] your immune system and build your immune
[4180.16 - 4186.84] system
[4181.52 - 4189.84] yeah and all of this
